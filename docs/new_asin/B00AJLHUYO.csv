5441478,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Out of all the films labeled as horror to be released this year, not many (if any at all) have actually had bite to them or have offered authentic scared. As incredible as ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was, it was how the film messed with your head and it's completely epic mind-warping conclusion that made it so memorable. Most PG-13 fare like ""The Woman in Black"" or ""House at the End of the Street"" relied on nothing but jump out scares while R-rated horror like ""Piranha 3DD"" and ""Chernobyl Diaries"" are just poorly written all around and awful however you try to look at them.

Thankfully ""Sinister"" can be categorized with your favorites from throughout the year. One of the ways it's able to accomplish that is how it utilizes sound in addition to its visuals to attempt to creep you out. The more senses a horror film is able to play with and manipulate properly to put you that much closer to the edge of your seat, the better that particular film turns out to be. What you hear in ""Sinister"" and the way those sounds seem like they're coming from all around you makes the events that unfold throughout the film all the more terrifying.

Such heavy use of sound effects actually contributes to the film's incredibly glowing reputation. The encompassing creaks of the house of the Oswalt family are almost overwhelming at times because you can never quite pinpoint where they're coming from and the score is just as paralyzing. The music is very unusual as it's typically a pulsating rhythm with a ton of bass, the sounds of super 8 film reaching the end of its track, or various sounds that appear to be out of tune and/or played backwards. These noises almost seem like they shouldn't be strung together to make the score of a film since they're just sounds and noise, but the score is successfully rattling and is really unnerving.

The emphasis on the super 8 projector and home movies comes off very well. Seeing Ellison (Ethan Hawke) prepare each film or seeing the horrors he witnesses in the darkness of his office in the reflection of his glasses is grotesquely mesmerizing. ""Sinister"" finds a way to make the concept of playing a super 8 film compelling every time that projector is turned on. The use of dynamic perspectives, the close-ups of the lens of the camera or the on/off switch of the projector, and the scene where Ellison falls asleep on the couch with a bat in his lap as the sun rises are just a few examples of how glorious the cinematography is.

Aside from the super 8 films, the menacing figure of Bughuul/Mr. Boogie that appears in each film has one of the most unique concepts to be put into a horror film of recent memory. Hearing his origins for yourself is part of the film's macabre charm, but just embrace the fact that there are still horror movies out there that are trying to do something different and original.

The one thing that ""Sinister"" doesn't necessarily do wrong, but may not sit right with a lot of people is revolve so heavily around children. Their inclusion works perfectly, but their involvement feels overused and a bit silly by the time the film's conclusion rolls around. Whether you're a fan of evil children in horror to begin with may play a factor in that though. The problem with that is that getting rid of that aspect of the film would also rob you one of the defining moments of the film, so it's kind of a catch-22 situation.

""Sinister"" does for home movies what ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" did for nightmares. The combination of an extremely well-edited film along with a score that immediately puts the hairs on your arms on end and sound effects that make your spine tingle completely envelopes you in this cocoon of anxiety. Many horror films fall apart once their origins are explained, but ""Sinister"" only seems to flourish on the fact that its explanations only make the final product more frightening. With a magnificent performance from Ethan Hawke, ""Sinister"" provides the authentic scares the horror junkie in you has been craving all year long.",1350000000,7,4026,4.647471910112359
5441479,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister is one of those movies that you just know you have to see because the buzz around it is so darn huge. Usually, movies with massive buzz turn out to be duds, yet Sinister skillfully avoids this accursed fate, I'm happy to say! It stars my favorite actor Ethan Hawke, who, I'm happy to realize, has fathered children with his former nanny, a true, touching love fest to be sure!

The plot of Sinister revolves around Hawke's character who is a true-crime fanboy, which means that he is really a superfan of serial killers, and he makes his living by purchasing serial killer memorabilia (such as Chuck Manson's sweet-a/s/s guitar and Scott Peterson's hands that strangled Lacey!). Ewww, eerie, right? I know! Anyhoo, to purchase this memorabilia, he has a lot of traveling to do, which is why he very benevolently moves his family around from new city to new city, uprooting his kids wherever he goes. However, Hawke finally settles in an old house (oh, you know that it just will turn out to be an Amityville Horror house of some kind *rolls eyes*), yet he discovers a treasure trove of old, VHS movies that really gets the plot moving into full-steam.

It turns out that there was a family of liberals who was actually murdered in his new house! The old, VHS movies are actually old recordings this ultra-crazy family of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-like libs made before they were murdered. As the story progresses, we see with increasing horror how this family of slain libs actually recorded all of their debauched acts, such as promoting voting without any checks for IDs at voting booths, handing taxpayer money over to green-energy companies like Solyndra, and, worst of all, taking turns defecating on the U.S. flag! Horrid, I know!

Watching all of these old, VHS movies unleashes a horribly malevolent, supernatural entity in Hawke's new house, and his family is immediately under threat. This diabolical entity begins to do all sorts of noxious things, such as p/e/e on the family's American flag, banish crosses all over the home and even set all TVs in the house to MSNBC. After a while, poor Hawke and his family become crazy, with Hawke finally snapping and killing his wife and his little, crippled, undergrown 8-year-old boy, in what the authorities later suspect was a ""roid rage"" killing. Shockingly, we the audience find out in the epilogue that the only thing wrong with the house was that it had some asbestos in the walls that was leaking out and causing this craziness. In other words, the Hawke character killed his family and his crippled, 8-year-old, retarded son for nothing!

Honestly, I had mixed emotions about the stunning ending because it played on my emotions rather cruelly, especially because my emotions are still raw from all those newspaper accounts of whole families being murdered that I always read. Nonetheless, I will still buy Sinister on video tape when it is finally released, mainly because Ethan Hawke can do no wrong, as he proved in his greatest role ever, White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf.",1350000000,4,3049,4.835249042145594

5441511,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Boards of Canada is the soundtrack of this movie. If you've heard of them, you now have an idea of just how creepy this movie is. If you've never heard of BoC, I won't ruin the surprise. Few movies spook me. I am a horror movie freak. I love a movie that can give me the chills but there have been so few and far between lately. Then along comes this movie. Sinister. It gives a whole new, different perspective on 16mm films. Ethan Hawke plays a true-crime novelist on the fringe of becoming a has-been. He moves his entire family into a house where a dark and terrifying murder had taken place a few years prior. All that was left was a box of old movies and a 16mm projector. The rest is history. I love this movie. It's the kind of horror flick you can watch and get spooked. There are different kinds of horror films. Ones you can make fun of. Ones you can spoof. Terrible horror films that are more comedy than horror. And the truly spooky. This movie is hardcore #4 all the way. And worth every second.",1506470400,7,1009,4.233160621761658

5441525,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Original ideas in horror are hard to come by given the nature of the genre. The fans all want to be scared, some want blood and gore, and do we ever really want to see a happy ending? The idea behind Sinster was simple, lets give fans a little bit of everything and see how they react. Seeking peace and solitude, real crime writer, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), moves his family to the country, unaware that the house he's living in has a checkered past. That is until he finds an old movie projector with 8mm films, that will horrify the man to his core. Having children as the perpetrators of these crimes was my favorite part of the film, I love it when horror movies do that, because what could be scarier than an evil child. You take the most innocent thing in the world, turn it evil, and once that happens what can you do about it? Would you be able to shoot a kid? So how do you stop them? The idea is bone chilling. I also liked the fact that they touch on every aspect of the genre they could from ghosts to possession, from gore to jump scares, they really did include a lot. The problem however is that the film focuses on Ethan Hawke, who tries to shield his family from what's happening, while investigating the events on his own, and this makes the time in between events move at a snails pace. With so much going for it, this is a movie that should have a lot going on, not long periods of nothingness. Personally I'd like to see the story focus on a child and watch as he/she transforms into one of the kids in the 8mm films, that would be cool. For what it's worth, this wasn't a bad film, the cast was pretty good, and they did a lot with what they had, but ultimately Sinister just moved a little too slowly for me.",1497312000,,1736,4.200598802395209

5441534,3,B00AJLHUYO,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie at first.  The scares were not jump scares (generally) and the tension was a really slow buildup.  It started off more as a true crime/mystery and slowing leaked into thriller/horror.  It also contained excellent realistic issues.  There was a scene where the main couple argue for a solid 5 minutes and everything going on (more like a drama).  The ""bad guy"" was well done and was very creepy.  The biggest fault for me came with the dead kids.  The extended video clips were good, but I wish they had just kept the kids looking normal.  The dead kid look just made it cheesy and sort of ruined the whole feel of the movie which, before the kids, was super unique and awesome (moving pictures and whatnot).",1494028800,,748,4.571428571428571

A proper blend of mood, lighting, music, story and character development. A good horror movie does not need blood and guts.  Sinister was made to get a PG-13 rating but received the R rating on content alone. Ethan Hawke gives a good performance as the protagonist. Scott Derrickson gives good direction to the cast. The performances were believable, the music keeps your attention and the slow building plot unfolds in a logical manner with a surprise waiting at the end.

The plot was complex and intriguing, however, it was hard to keep along with because the entire movie was almost pitch black. The character played by Ethan Hawke is a terrible father, the children and mother are all very one-dimensional, and Bughuul is a cheap attempt to make the Boogieman scary. Every time Derrickson tried a jumpscare, it was painfully bad and obvious; each new element of the plot was introduced in rapid-fire succession until there was a pile of crappy directions distorting the original story.

5441558,4,B00AJLHUYO,"a new twist on a fairly predictable scenario. don't get me wrong, it was watchable. and enjoyable. however, it lacked something. i gave 4 stars because i thought the acting was pretty good, and the filming was nice in setting the mood. the ending was almost predictable. i almost knew just what was going to happen by that point. And the last bit ( a minute or so) was complete cheese. i'm talking limburger. The closing scenes really took away from the film.",1484870400,,459,4.542168674698795

Not a relentless and perverse display of human suffering mind you.  Just enough tragic creepiness to challenge your ability to sit straight through it.  Great horror flick without doubt.

The thing I think this movie is really good at is an all around eerie feeling throughout and doesn't give to much away. There's not allot of jump scares it just immerses you in this feeling fear and also carries a very well played sub plot. The sub plot being an issue in martial discourse. I like how alternative religious ideology was brought up instead of Christian,  every other horror movie with ghosts and demons brings in a priest not this one, well played.  This has everything I look for in a good scary movie not allot of jump scares more plot then just oh no its a ghost and thinks out side the box as far as the entity. So genuinely creepy, not allot of jump scares check it out.",1475798400,5,829,4.234177215189874

My biggest criticisms are that the main villain design is not very scary, and of course the lack of originality.

But this movie is SO well filmed. Some of the camera angles are outstanding, many scenes are shot without a cut, which really brings you into the movie. Sound design is outstanding, lots of realistic atmospheric creaking..great creepy soundtrack. Fantastic acting by every single cast member. Great writing. So despite the formulaic movie, it's executed so well I can't complain. It's like having a particularly good Hamburger.

5441684,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Now this is what you call HORROR!!! 

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie starts off with four people hanging from a tree - their heads are covered by sacks so we cannot see their faces.

Ellison, a crime writer, moves into the same house (we catch a glimpse of the same tree) together with his wife, Tracy and their two children, Ashley and Trevor. Ellison does not tell him family that the Stevenson family was murdered there, some months back. He wants to use the story for his next novel and hopes to find something about them, especially the fifth member of their family who went missing after the murders.

Ellison stumbles on some tapes and a recorder in the attic. It is just what he needs for his research. To his horror, he discovers that they are all snuff films - murders of several other families since the early 1960s. In each footage, a demonic figure is standing at the crime scene. It's glared but Ellison feels that it is staring at him...

Things start to go haywire for Ellison and his family - especially for Trevor who has nightmares. You have to watch it to find out the rest!!! It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - overall, it is worth your money!!",1473033600,,1228,4.53393665158371

5441688,5,B00AJLHUYO,Not for the faint of heart. I've watched it several times and still have to look away during some scenes. If you can stomach it though then I highly recommend it. It does it's job of terrifying you. It makes you simultaneously hate the main character for getting himself (and his family) into his situation and feel sorry that he is. It is so disturbing that you question yourself for being able to sit through it. The actors are good. Nice use of folklore even though I'm not sure if it's accurate or made up for the film. The creature was very simple looking but fear inducing nonetheless. The author's kids were creeping me out before I knew the bigger part children played. I honestly thought I was doomed for a little bit after watching the film. Good film to gift anyone you don't want to have children and want to traumatize for life.,1471910400,,841,4.467532467532467

5441735,2,B00AJLHUYO,"I expected this to be ""scary"" and since the box cover rated it comparable to Paranormal Activity I was pretty disappointed in what I viewed. It takes more than filming the entire movie in the dark to make it scary. It did have some good points , nice plot twist and a solid ending but I wouldn't call it much more than a thriller... definitely not horror. There were also a number of plot flaws that, for those who pay attention to details, leave you lingering too much on what's wrong with a scene. The family moves into a ranch house that has a very low roof pitch but when in the attic (lots of scenes are in the attic) it has a high peaked roof that's at least 8-feet at the center and in a ranch house the best you can do in the attic is a crawl. for those who had the crap scared out of them it was likely diarrhea rather than fear. I'm not critic but I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid 60-years ago and this isn't one I could recommend though it was a good little mystery and the found footage factor and has played all too much. It would have been much better to focus on the creepy daughter and what she was up to.",1468713600,,1139,4.066666666666666

5441752,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Even with its modern setting and use of current technology, Sinister is a motion picture that is a throw-back to the horror films of the 1920s  1940s. We can even see the roots of the film in some of the work of H. P. Lovecrafts such as The Dunwich Horror or The Call of Cthulhu.  The protagonist, Ellison Oswalt is searching for a rational explanation of the horrific events only to discover, in the denouement, that there is a demonic, extra dimensional, or supernatural cause.  But his tragic flaw can be traced back to Greek Tragedy, such as Oedipus Rex. Once he has made a decision to investigate this case solo, his course is set and nothing he does will changes that course.
Ten years ago, Ellison had a best-selling true-crime book called Kentucky Blood.  In that book, he discovered evidence that the local police had overlooked which lead to the case being solved.  As a result, he had much fame and fortune.  Since then, his fortunes have declined.  His second two books were failures.  He even acknowledges that due to the one book a true killer went free.  His method of writing involves spending a lot of time at the crime scenes, trying to get into the killers head. To write one book, he actually moved his family into a house a few doors down from the murder house, a decision that still does not sit well with his wife. His family members feel the brunt of his investigations from the locals.  While his wife is harassed by local police and his children are harassed at school, he can stay at home and do his work with little disturbance or local conflict.
Ellison could readily support his family by teaching college and editing text books but his hubris stands in his way.  He begins to investigate an unsolved crime in an unnamed Pennsylvania town.  A family of four was murdered using a very Rube Goldberg device, and the youngest child, a girl about his own daughters age is missing presumed dead. In his arrogance, he moves his family of four into the very house where nine months ago the murder occurred.
While his family is tight and loving, they all find his chosen profession to be a bit unsettling.  Despite this his wife, Tracy, does not question him strenuously.  She accepts his lie of, I promise you I did not move us into a house a few doors down from where the murders occurred, with only slight unease. This type of semantic lie should be well known to most of us.  He seems on several occasions to be about to confess to this, but he never does and when she finds out by accident, events have gone too far.
Scenes of moving into the house show the viewer that both children are extremely upset at having their lives disrupted.  The son, Trevor, might be on the edge of being Emotionally Disturbed, or is going through a difficult adolescence.  He has a history of night terrors, a condition that often dissipates at puberty.  The daughter, Ashley, is quite fey and has been given permission to paint on the walls of her room. Both children have been given strict orders to stay out of his office.
Ellison is moving items into the attic when he discovers both a scorpion and a bankers box with an 8mm projector and several movies with titles such as Hanging Out and Family Barbeque. He brings the box into his office and that very night after the family has gone to bed, he sits to watch these films.  The first film that he watches is Family Barbeque and he realizes that the family playing near the tree in the back yard is the very family that owned his new home. They sit to eat lunch and the film suddenly shifts to the murder filmed around the same tree they were just playing around. His decision to not turn the films over to the authorities leads to his descent. Trevors night terrors have returned even worse than before.  Both children are acting out both at home and socially.  The fracture lines between Ellison and Tracy widen.  Finally, Ellison begins to see the creature that he saw in the home movies in real life.
If you like horror that gets under your skin and moves in, this film is one you will enjoy very much.  The images are quiet disturbing but there is little gore for an R-rated film. The acting is superb and it is obvious that all involved with the production are highly invested in making a superlative film. Despite the lurid cover art, this motion picture is not torture porn.  The bloodiest scene in the film is reflected in Ellisons glasses as he watches the murders in Sleepy Time.  If you enjoy a horror films that is a journey of discovery, top notch acting, and continually unfolding shocks, you will consider this to be one of the best horror films out there. In some ways this is a meta-film, a horror film about the effects of watching horror films on the protagonist. If you need the relentless gore and acting chops are not something you regard highly, you will probably feel ripped off by this film.
The extras on the DVD were quite good.  The director's commentaries both as director and as co-writer were extremely interesting. There is a documentary on true-crime writers and another one about properties where horrific murders have occurred.
While my review has some spoilers, I reveal nothing that the trailer put out by the production company does not reveal.",1467763200,,5246,4.560170394036208

Myself and everyone i know, if we started hearing noises or had some paranormal crap start going on, every light in  the house would be on in like 45 seconds flat. But these films they meander all thru the house with baseball bats passing many light switches :/ weird.

Don't expect any happy ending here. Hell, expect no happiness, period! Lovers of supernatural horror, tired of soppy, Hollywood finales, need not worry. No light survives! Ethan Hawke (TRAINING DAY) is superb as ""true crime"" author, Ellison Oswalt, who is trying to re-capture past glory, after his last couple of books have tanked. After moving his family into a new, questionably-chosen, house, Oswalt sets out to research the latest grisly subject matter. He's hoping for a best seller, but will soon face something unexpected, unexplained, and relentlessly life-threatening!

5441859,3,B00AJLHUYO,"It's not bad.

It's genuinely creepy at times.

Something about where all the buildup leads just doesn't seem satisfying.  Perhaps it's because the mystery of what's happening (if you can call it that) is so painfully obvious.  If it weren't so obvious, then the people who succumb would seem legitimately caught by the foe.  Since it is, they just seem foolish.  It could certainly have done without the ""you can barely see anything at all"" or the ""you can't see anything except the one circle lit by a too-tiny flashlight"" camera work.  Contrary to heightening any scary vibe, it just frustrated me.

Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.  Would have been more glad if it were included in Prime.  If you've already watched the good stuff, and especially if you don't have to pay extra to rent this like I did, it's not terrible.",1461888000,,836,4.587837837837838

Ethan Hawke's acting is spot on, you can easily put yourself in his place as the tension ramps up. There are plenty of gruesome scenes but none of them are gratuitous. The soundtrack is probably the best of its genre, with a different track for each of the mini films within the movie.

I didn't like this one though I wanted to as Ethan Hawke was in it. Also Fred Thompson was the sheriff & I kept expecting him to say ""Reverse mortgage from AAG.""

Anyway, the movie had potential as it delved lightly into how true crime writers both benefit from & exploit the pain/torture/death of others.
It had potential but lost it FAST! What sane person moves into the house of a murdered family, starts experiencing extremely strange things, & says we should stay & figure this out. Really!??

5442019,5,B00AJLHUYO,"This is a TRULY original horror film that has a substantial creep factor to it that makes you literally look behind you if your back is turned toward a darkened corner.  I had never heard of this movie and chose to purchase it because the price was right and I love horror flicks, even the really bad ones, but this turned out to be a brilliant movie.  The tale is told by a writer who has made his bones by writing about brutal crimes and has fallen from grace because after making a big splash and helping someone falsely accused of a crime, he went on to help free someone  who was as guilty as sin and that blow to his reputation has put him in a rough spot financially.  His desperation to find that next big story to put him back on top and insure that his wife and two children will be enjoying their previously gilded lifestyle leads him to move into the home of a murdered family where one of the children, their youngest daughter, went missing and law enforcement has no clue where she went or if she is even alive.
While he ( Ethan Hawke) tries to piece together what happened to the family and the missing little girl, he stumbles upon something so evil and unexpected that he struggles against his personal need to find the answers and the duty to protect his family from what he has found.

If you like a genuinely good story and to get the heebie jeebies from watching a movie, then this is the film for you.  An absolute gem!",1453680000,,1441,4.279411764705882

I think what I enjoyed about the movie was the main character; I am a writer, and the way Ethan Hawk portrayed being a writer was very well done and realistic; he would do anything for his book.

It resonated on the atmospheric level, with all the best cinematographic suspense/scare tactics - dark shots that draw you in, low angles, and Ethan Hawke is exactly the right guy for the driven father who completely discounts his family's safety, let alone their wishes, in pursuing what he wants.

5442139,5,B00AJLHUYO,I absolutely enjoy this movie. My fascination with it is the fact that the story revolves around an old film projector and a box of film reels. The reels contain video of each murder that occurred in different areas and houses. It keeps you on your toes and has you thinking about what happened to each family and why. Why did those murders happen? Who is truly responsible. I was on the edge of my seat and watching intently throughout. Fun fact: Stephen King himself even enjoyed this film and had gone to see the second one which I pre-ordered.,1447977600,,547,4.48

5442162,3,B00AJLHUYO,"The good: the movie was appropriately creepy, with good direction and some really nice shots. The (eventual) plot was interesting and as far as I'm aware, unique. This film takes the old trope of ""move into a new house, uh oh creepy stuff!"" and turns it around a little, which is nice. The actors are good, even (and especially) the child actors. There was enough gore to make the scenes feel real, without having an excessive amount. What blood there was really only was there to reinforce that violence that occurred. There is no gratuitous gore, guts or nudity. This movie really wants to stand up on the merit of its story and not how much fake blood they can get in one shot, which I really do appreciate.

The not so good: there were times when the movie pulled me out of the story it was building, which is disappointing and limits my ability to get pulled back into the narrative. Overall it felt like there were some scenes missing from the the film. I am unaware of any deleted scenes but the film felt like I should know a little bit more about what was going on with the individuals themselves. The characters as the film stands are very flat feeling, not having much of anything else going on except what's immediately happening on screen. It seems like there was a lot that hit the cutting room floor.

With all that said, this would make an exceptional novel, especially if some of the meat and mythos of the story could be gotten to. As it stands, this film leaves me with more questions than answers, and not in the good way.

Overall: if you're looking for a creepy psychological thriller that you can put down with ease, this is fine. As much as this movie wants to, it won't follow you home.",1447718400,,1711,4.442675159235669

Almost not worth watching.  Can't decide.  4/10 maybe.  Nothing really happens - this film tries to be a ""little kids are scary"" type of movie.  The only stuff that is actually creepy, it doesn't do enough of.  It figures out its story by the end, but who cares by then.  Most of the scares in the film are the score and soundtrack - loud noises might scare an audience, but it's a cheap scare.  It's not creative or clever or worthy of horror film history.

It starts out promising, this eccentric writer and his unknowing family move into a home with a horrifying past...what will become of this all-American family?!!  Well, I'm certainly not going to tell because that just wouldn't be appropriate, but I will say this: the movie jumps the shark at one point (in my opinion).  The thrills are cheap and leave the audience with that, ""what the..."" face at several moments.

I gave it 3 stars not because the movie wasn't acted well or pacing wasn't good or any technical aspect was bad. I gave it 3 stars (was going to be 2 ) because of the way it ended.  If you are like me and like movies to end on a good note with the so called ""good guys"" defeating the evil whatever then this movie isn't for you.  I don't like it when movies have to end in such a way as too leave a possible sequel and i feel they did it here just to achieve that ( just google it and yup a sinister 2 is a reality ).  After going through an hour and a half of tense edge of you seat suspense it would be nice to see the good guys win.

Director Derrickson does a good job telling a compelling story, using sound design and music, and making a film that basically occurs in one location not feel low budget or boring. The soundtrack is one of the stronger ones I've heard in some time. Ethan Hawke does a solid job. My only confusion was when Hawke's character was watching the found footage and I wasn't sure if the sound/music was from the found footage or the movie we the viewer see; but this is a minor criticism. The pacing is pretty masterful and Derrickson does a good job heightening tension and creating creepy, jumpy, memorable moments.",1445904000,2,727,4.732283464566929

5442300,2,B00AJLHUYO,"Film incorporates elements of other horror/serial killer stories, including The Shining, and Red Dragon, but protagonist is too dumb to generate much sympathy.
Film Strengths:
(1) Acting, especially by Ethan Hawke, is solid. The boy who plays the son is good. The actresses playing the Mom and daughter give decent performances. I think the actress playing the mom is poorly directed, especially in the more heated, argument scenes with Ethan Hawke's character. She's best in the film's opening and early sequences, when her character is relaxed, playful and believable. As the story progresses, her characterization suffers. This is writer's/director's fault, not the actress.
(2) Villain is frightening. His previous terrifying murders are presented as snuff films which he obligingly leaves for the dad to find his first day in the house. Monster targets ordinary, innocent families and their children, murdering them in especially frightening ways and is an effective villain.
Story Weaknesses:
(1) Dad character - a 30 something man moves his family into their second house, though his wife and children clearly oppose it. He says he's broke (though not too broke to carry two mortgages). The story is about a demon attacking children in families because said demon has a taste for children's souls, and getting children to do evil deeds is it's way of reaching out of it's realm and into the human realm (according to the film) to acquire the children. For the villain to have access, the children need to live at some point in the haunted house with their parents. The thing is, the story is confused as to the father's role. Is he hero/innocent victim or perp enabler? I argue that he's the perp enabler but the story presents him as hero/victim. Film has the father chasing grisly murders/crimes to sensationalize them and make money off them (as in writing another bestselling book, maybe get a movie deal, etc.). He buys the house for research purposes (my opinion) but gets more than he bargains for when he finds and begins viewing films that show the murders of the most recent victims, as well as other unknown murders. He lies to his family about the history of the new house, forcing them to leave their old (grander) house, and worse, forcing them to leave their schools and their friends. That's a huge thing for a parent to do, especially when not absolutely necessary. The film communicates that the father, who says he's broke, can swing two mortgages simultaneously, but insists on uprooting his family when he could've allowed them to remain in the old house and continue in their school with their friends, while he did research at the new place. As he insists on uprooting them, his behavior isn't a positive indicator of his willingness to prioritize their comfort above his own. The story presents him (wrongfully in opinion) as hero, the story is told from his point of view, and though he fails to tell his family about the history of the house (in essence, lying to them), he is presented by the film as largely innocent of anything except ambition and love for his family. But it is ambition that is used as bait to get him to move his family to the haunted house. The story presents him as basically a decent man but though he is the head of his family and tasked with their financial well-being, he is actually the family's weakest link and the demon enters their lives via his lies and actions. Since that is the case, I think the story is wrong to present the film from his point of view, with him bearing the brunt of the demon's reveal, highlighting his fear, anxiety and confusion. Because the father knew that the murders had occurred in the back yard, and that the perp had not been caught, and because he also refused to warn his family, the story didn't have the right (in my opinion) to present him as innocent victim - he is victim, but he is not innocent. He put himself and his family into a vulnerable position and then is shocked when something bad happens. The thing is, the audience comes to the film knowing something bad is going to happen. The story is titled ""Sinister,"" an in your face indicator, so we already know more than the characters do when the film begins. The story can't afford stupid, slow, enabling or clueless characters and expect the audience to be sympathetic. Given what we know relative to the characters, the audience needs a hero/heroine fast off the mark, and the dad as written is not that character.  He's written too old school and is far too slow. He's a writer, he's obviously a modern American, but he's apparently never seen a horror film. He writes about grisly crimes but doesn't seem to believe a murderer could directly impact his family. Case in point: he finds snuff films his first day in the house and begins viewing them. Instead of reporting the findings and turning them over to the police, and moving his family out of the house asap, he starts to drink and continues to do so throughout much of the film. (The filmmaker's weak setup of him being under financial stress doesn't work.) Despite multiple inexplicable and strange occurrences, the dad character stays in the house (and worse, keeps his family there), until the demon appears in front of him and basically shouts ""boo"" (only slightly exaggerating), upon which he finally leaves. A better way for the filmmaker to have handled this story would've been: (a) writer moves his family to their new house giving the same explanation for the move to them as he does in present film, which is weak but better than nothing; (b) he reassures wife/kids and puts them to bed; (c) he goes to work in the study (I think it's unbelievable that someone would put in a full day of moving and then go to work, but if the storyteller needs to prove that badly the guy is determined to get to work, okay - I wouldn't have done it though); (d) he discovers/views the first snuff films; (e) he calls police, gives films to them, makes a statement; (f) he wakes up his family and calms them; (g) he drives his family to their former house or to a motel, they do not sleep in house upon dad's discovery of those films (this is crucially important - the dad's motivation is supposedly trying to obtain long-term financial security for his family, but that only matters if his family is alive. A mass murderer who has placed snuff films for him to find is a real threat to him and his family and he needs to take that threat seriously or the audience completely dumps him as a reliable character); (h) writer puts everybody to bed (either at their old house or at the motel); (i) he calls movers next day to collect items left behind; and (j) he discovers snuff films delivered with the rest of the family's belongings to their house. The story becomes how the father, with the aid of his wife, the police and the researcher he'd communicated with already, tries to rid himself of the demon who's attached itself to his family. If the film had taken these steps (or showed the parents react to their new reality in a believable/proactive way), and the demon followed the family anyway, that could've still worked and the audience wouldn't think the dad was a moron for staying in a house after he found snuff films there. As filmed, the story loses the audience the first night, when the father views the films and remains. What dad in real life would move his family to a house where another family has been murdered and the perp has not been identified/captured, finds a home movie of those murders, fails to report his finds to the police, and remains in the house with his wife/children. Boggles the mind, especially as the family is not destitute. Ethan Hawke is a good actor, but nobody could sell that. If the film had had him flee post haste, it could've argued that the dad had no idea the murders were supernatural, and that though he had been selfish in moving his family from their home/school/friends, he did have to earn a living and had been trying to create long-term financial security for them. The villain could've still gotten the family in the end if the filmmakers wanted that to be the case, but the father character would've been so much stronger (and the audience so much more emotionally invested) if he'd behaved in a believable manner. Think how much better the story would've been if the dad character had been able to mount some sort of defense, perhaps even, with help, an offense. Think back to Nightmare on Elm Street when the teenage girl launched an offensive against Freddy. She still lost the war, but at least she tried to save herself. The dad character in Sinister provides zero protection for his family, and in fact, is used to move them to a location where they become vulnerable to the demon's attack. So the father's characterization is the weak link for his family and in filmmaker's story presentation as well. But he's presented as hero. There are no hero's in Sinister, mainly victims and a villain.
(2) Mom character - nothing done with her, and I mean nothing. She's whinny and ineffectual; a traditionally written woman character who brings nothing interesting or new to the story. I like George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, not bad for it's time. The mom character in Sinister would've fit right into the idea of women characters as the helpless hysteric/powerless illustrated in that late 60s film. Nowadays many women support their families, even earn more than their husbands. Be nice to see a woman character a husband can turn to and actually lean on in times of crisis instead of the ""little woman"" needing his protection. I understand the filmmakers wanted a name actor because that increased their chances of getting their film made, and they got it made, but the father character they wrote doesn't work well for the story.
To summarize, the demon is an effective and scary villain, but the dad is slow, clueless and greedy. It is believable that he wouldn't assume that a demon was attacking him or that he'd moved his family into a haunted house, but the snuff films should've gotten him moving alot faster than they did. The mom character is uninteresting, outdated and stock. Writer needed to re-imagine/update the parents. Also found it unbelievable that a man who just moved into a new house and is wandering around at night with moving boxes everywhere wouldn't turn on lights. People have lights in their house precisely so that they can see where they're walking at night. When a character ignores the light switch in a horror film, I roll my eyes. Lastly, disliked the music/sound effects, thought they were overdone. 2 stars for the scary villain and decent acting. One star removed for poor dad character, one removed for poor mom character, one removed for irritating music/sound. With a truly frightening monster, you don't need to overdo music/sound effects, they just get in the way.",1444953600,,10900,4.727798213347346

I guess I should have known not to expect much when I read that the same people created Saw and PA.

 I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft,and stories of otherworldly entities, so the reference to ""pagan entities""in the trailer peeked my interest.

Turned out to e a letdown though. The killings were certainly chilling and effective enough, and it had its share of jump-scares  and creepy imagery. The use of children was rather effective too. Unfortunately  it was spoiled by an uninspired supernatural entity that seemed more like the lead singer from a heavy metal band than a being from the dawn of time.

Note to filmmakers. If you're going to use an otherworldly hellbeast in your films, make it do more that make people commit murders. And avoid showing it as much as possible. And if you do, make it something besides a boogieman in a mask.",1444262400,,863,4.713333333333333

5442361,4,B00AJLHUYO,"One could argue that the goal of a horror movie is to scare the audience. Additionally, they are often not the most memorable movies when it comes to a story-line and character development. Sinister is unique. It is a film that satisfies a horror-lovers desires but also carries on a great plot and tremendous character development.
 The main character, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is an established author that wrote one extremely successful book, giving him five seconds of fame. He is trying to write another book to help support his family, but he is also writing the book for a more selfish reason: to become famous again. Ellison puts his family at risk by moving them into a house where a murder occurred in the backyard. He finds a box of home movies that actually contain footage of families being brutally murdered. Unlike other scary movies, Sinister actually has a decent plot and has reasoning behind why the character stays in the scary or threatening situation. For example, Ellison did not find the movies and is watching them for fun; he is watching the movies for a reason, for his benefit -- to become famous for a second time. The movie does not exclusively focus on the scary aspects like other horror movies, it also focuses on a plot.
 Each of the characters in Sinister have a certain style and personality that make you want to help, support, and rescue them. One of Ellison Oswalts kids, Trevor Oswalt (Michael Hall DAddario) starts having night terrors after living in the house for a short amount of time. As an audience member, I start to feel for him because his sleep disruptions are acting up due to something out of his control -- a supernatural being named Bughuul, also known as Mr. Boogie, who is terrorizing him and his family. Additionally, Ellison and his wife in the movie (Juliet Rylance) start to fight because of his idiotic decision to move into a house where people were murdered. There is a backbone to the characters and this is not often seen in horror movies.
Along with the character development and a great plot, the movie also has the horror factor in its favor. There are jump scares, a spooky supernatural figure, and disturbing images and events that you cant unsee. The home movies that Ellison watches contain horrific and graphic murders of innocent families. It is unsettling to watch these murders happen right before your eyes. Sinister has memorable horrifying events that catch an audiences attention.
Bottom line, Sinister is sinister. This suspenseful film is most certainly one to remember. It is a movie that captures your attention in more ways than one.  Sinister contains gruesome horror that you want to forget, a plot that you will remember, and characters worth recognizing. Whether you choose to see it is up to you, but just be prepared because you are bound to have nightmares. One last thing, watch out for Mr. Boogie.",1443657600,2,2896,4.811244979919679

5442384,3,B00AJLHUYO,"This is a horror movie in the classical sense.  A writer of crime biographies [along the lines of In Cold Blood] is looking for JUST ONE MORE great, classic story and a big payout, then he and his family can be financially secure and settle down somewhere.  He picks the mysterious murder of all the members of one family except for a young daughter, who was never found.  Exactly where this was supposed to have taken place wasn't easily identified, but it looked along the lines of suburban Kentucky or Tennessee.  Fred Thompson [remember that guy whose younger wife wanted him to be President?] has a small role as the local police chief who is not at all happy to welcome some foreign writer into town, who may try to portray the police investigation as fundamentally flawed, since after all, the murderer remained un-caught and the girl still missing.

Plusjust to make it a better horror filmthe writer actually BOUGHT AND MOVED INTO the house where the murders took place.  [Well, TECHNICALLY they didn't take place in the HOUSEit was in the back yard].  Do you think that this will make his wife feel better, when she finds out?  Do you think it will make any difference to whoever or whatever did the crime?  Do you think that a writer who keeps focusing on un-solved gruesome murders, and now is focused on THIS one, just might possibly draw BAD JUJU, if there is anything like bad juju to be drawn?  The plot-spoiling answers of course, are: no, no, and an emphatic yes.  Ethan Hawke plays the father/writer and is always fun to watch.  Juliet Rylance does a good job playing a loving wife trying to be supportive to her husband but increasingly worried for their safety--especially the children.  And the kids do credible jobs too.

The main suspense here is not whether everything is going to work out well in the end, but who or what the killer will be.  No plot spoiler here.  As a horror film, it's OK.  It is not unnecessarily gory, there is no nudity, and a minimum of bad language.",1442966400,,2000,4.588732394366197
5442385,5,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie is scarier than you might think. All the clichs--from washed-up writer to the movie-within-a-movie--work better than they ought to. For me, the underlying subtext is what gives the scares their lasting chill. Ethan Hawke has sacrificed his family and children for success in much the same way that the ancient demon sacrifices children as part of its ritual. Mr. Boogie becomes Hawke's unholy alter ego.

Director Derrickson unfolds his mystery slowly and surely. You can tell what the ultimate solution is, but you don't want to believe it because it's either too frightening or too unbelievable. By the end, though, you'll be afraid no matter what you believe in, ghosts or not!",1442966400,,691,5.06140350877193

When they did have some lights on, they were never that bright as they should have been.

5442489,2,B00AJLHUYO,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW

I don't like to adopt the role of snobby movie reviewer. Normally I can't call other people's tastes in movies bad because I'm guilty of liking some downright terrible movies. BUT I am aware they're bad. I will totally admit when I enjoy a crappy movie for its crappiness because I am aware it is crappy. Anyone who gave this movie five stars clearly isn't as self aware as I am and should feel bad for leading people astray.

Let me get it out of the way now and compliment...
WHAT THE MOVIE DID RIGHT: the gruesome deaths.
These are done well, and with just enough spark to each one that you feel disgust being privy to such gruesome ends. They're rather creative in their simplicity, but they still leave you with a sick unease that would fit in a much better movie.

Now allow me to bullet point all the cruddy parts of...
WHAT THE MOVIE DID WRONG
- Why does no one ever turn on the lights? Ever? They explain at one point it's due to a blackout, but oh my god, several other times he's CLEARLY worried about someone having broken in and his response is to investigate in the dark.
- On this note: WHY IS EVERYTHING SO DARK? 90% of this movie is abstract, colored shapes. This works in the movie's favor at ONE point, but you will spend nearly every scene change trying to figure out where you are and what's going on now based off of those colored shapes.
- Seriously. I was confused by a ""major"" scare because I couldn't tell what the shape was in that split second.
- What was that? In the dark? Was it a ghost?!
- Or was it the main character bumping his hip on a table?
- You feel no connection to the family because the writer is some once-famous guy who wrote ONE New York Best Time Seller. He has clearly screwed his family over by not investing his money and riding on the idea that he would sell another amazing novel.
- You know what? Nevermind. I feel no connection to the family either. Wife is the usual supportive-but-end-of-her-rope-mom, daughter is an artist and sees ghosts, son has night terrors. There, family in a nutshell. At no point am I worried about any of them because I don't care about these horror movie trope cut outs.
- While the ""antagonist"" is pretty creepy, I couldn't help but think the writer/director was afraid of KISS as a child or something.
- Occult explanation that is piece-meal. They explain enough for the premise to make sense and it just kind of peters from there.
- Other predictable tropes across the board.
- Cheap jump scare because spooky.

Second to lastly: Amazon. You should feel bad for charging me $2.99 to keep this film for 24 hours. Lastly: Why won't you let me rate these movies from my tv after I've finished watching them? The least you can do is let me give it a 1 star and move on. Instead, here I am, trying to save someone else the time they could waste on this movie.",1441584000,,2861,4.352059925093633

Pretty much thinking to my self oh god I bet this is not going to be scary at all and pretty much not creative. But I actually ended up liking it.  What makes it good is the way the story unfolds and the way the suspense is built. Ethan hawk definetly performs well here his character is believable and really most of the story is told through his character.  Only complain I had about the movie was the fact that it was your very basic evil spirit haunts this house plot.

A certain demonic figure named ""Mr. Boogie"" apparently incites children to commit horrific murders of their family members.  Why?  Who knows?  It just happens.

I guess that should do it, huh? No one will care if it doesn't add up or make any sense, right? Horror movie audiences are idiots, right? Plot? Who needs a plot? We'll make it up every day on the set. To add to the confusion, this family lives in the darkest house in the world -- it's pitch black inside even when the sun is out.

5442724,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Sinister"" (2012)

1. This is one of those ""a family moves into a house where a murder occurred and they live to regret it"" movies.

2. It's about a true-crime writer that finds a box of home movies in his new attic. The home movies are actually snuff films.

3. The beginning title scene is one of the creepiest movie openings I've ever seen.

4. The movie is pretty predictable, but it's not boring. It goes from one creepy scene to the next without many breaks.

5. The tension is broken because it gets a little silly at times. The dad follows horror-movie logic. However, there are attempts to logically explain why he does what he does. It doesn't always work, but it's nice to see.

6. Given the rather upsetting subject matter of the film, there isn't much actual blood or gore.

7. The home movies are the most disturbing parts of the film. The ""Lawn Work"" home movie shows the least, but upset me the most.

8. The movie uses the regular ripoffs of ""Poltergeist"", ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Shining"". But it gives everything a fresh coat of paint.

9. The soundtrack and sound effects are really well done. The movie provides a great case study for people who pay attention to sound design.",1440201600,,1234,4.5225225225225225

The movie DEFINITELY would not be as good without him. His experience brought a level of maturity to the role. Not like Oculus

Not gonna lie I was drawn in from the opening scene and felt like I was watching something special. Yes it does have some cheap scares in it and a rather predictable ending, but lets face it, kind of hard to come up with an ending to a movie of this type that has not been done already.

I love how the boogeyman, Bagul, is portrayed as a dark deity and the concept of his corrupting influence is in fact fascinating. Plus, the fact that even though Mr. Oswald moved away from the Hanging Out house, it didn't stop Bagil's reign of terror - it only made it continue!",1435881600,,489,4.6976744186046515
5442980,5,B00AJLHUYO,"This is an ingenious take on ""The Woman in Black"" by Susan Hill; the 1989 being the best version.
There are no cheap tricks, obvious or overused cliche ridden embellishments in order to evoke a quick and easy shock.
The horrific elements of the plot is so perfectly paced, the viewer is entranced and drawn into the growing threat of the demonic entity.

Details of both ""Sinister"" and ""The Lady in Black"" are almost identical; the restless soul of ""The Woman in Black"" is substituted for a Babylonian demon called Bughuul; the eater of children.
The incinerated box of cursed 8mm Kodak reels that reappears in Ethan Hawkes over mortgaged house is likened to the box of documents
from Eel Marsh House, which was also set to the flames; to no avail.
The toy soldier in ""The Woman in Black"" that keeps reappearing in the hand of Arthur Kipps underscores the hopeless effort to rid Kipps of the evil that has followed him and ultimately proves to be his demise as it is with the family of the Ostwalds.

Ethan Hawke is superb, especially in one particular scene with the deputy (James Ransone) who is such a gifted actor, that he's able to convey a mixture of apprehension, fright and unintended humor into his character.  Both actor's are so gifted, they convey their fear just by the use of eye movement and facial expressions; but their acting is never overdone or hammy.

5442991,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Like many horror movies these days, this film starts off promising and ends with a thud. Even the direction in the final minute or so is overly choreographed to be creepy, but really is just convoluted and tired.

Frankly, I don't know why screenwriters feel the need to concoct tales of demons and far-fetched cultish legends in order to ""explain"" supernatural phenomenon. Why can't  the fact that creepy things are happening be enough? There doesn't always need to be an answer, or a reveal of the big bad guy. I assume writers feel that their audiences deserve some concrete pay-off, but I think sometimes they forget that you CAN have pay-off with a little mystery and some loose ends. I would've been fine with this film ending at the family's leaving town, with maybe a few shots of the various murder scenes, like the tree and pool, and maybe the box of super 8 film somehow resurfacing elsewhere. I also dislike when the directer shows too much of the menace...the heavy makeup on the creepy children was poorly  done and exaggerated, and this detracted from the scare.

I agree with others that the snuff film element was really the meat of this film; any movie that inspires the viewer to pause, go downstairs and check the locks, then do it once more for good measure, has something special. But the film got lost with the crazy demonic thread and lost steam as it focused more heavily on this. I also wanted more character development of the wife and children, and maybe some more input from the people in town re: the murders.

All in all? A strong 2.5 that doesn't really earn a 3 but isn't deserving of a 2 either. Not a total waste of time, but could've been loads more effective.",1435104000,,1696,4.584158415841584

I've slept through so many it's not even funny!

""Sinister"" is the first genuinely scary movie I've seen since ""The Exorcist."" By scary I mean I actually flinched at several of the scenes, and was even had goose bumps a couple times.

For me, in order for a movie to be truly scary, it has to catch me off guard, do the unexpected, which is not necessarily bloody or gory, just good timing and well thought out and portrayed.

I've always liked Ethan Hawke, but to be honest, I was a little leery to begin with. You don't see too many Hollywood Stars giving their best performances in horror flicks.

Ethan Hawke definitely hit one out of the park with this one though.",1434499200,,796,4.424657534246576

5443006,5,B00AJLHUYO,"How Sinister made it past me for so long will forever be a mystery. Fortunately the film didn't evade me forever and earlier this weekend I was able to sit down and take a peek.

Horror movies provide different experiences for everyone. Ive sat through viewings of The Human Centipede with people who giggle and laugh and think the movie should be classified as a comedy, know people who find Wolfcop to be the least funny movie of all time, and read reviews of Insectula! that praise it as some godsend to the genre. Taste is in the eye of the viewer, and the experience of watching a horror film different for all.

Sinister is the first movie in a long while that legitimately creeped me out. The subject matter is intense to say the least, but what really sealed the deal is how strong and story is from beginning to end. The opening sequence sets the tone and the film continues to build from there. Scott Derrickson (writer/director) does a brilliant job building the tension in the film, and this may be Ethan Hawkes best film to date. Hes really that good.

The story is predictable. Anyone with a rudimentary background in horror/suspense/thriller movies can figure out how the films going to end, but it doesnt matter. A great film is one that doesnt try to pull a weird ass twist or dues ex machina ending just to be contrary to audience expectation. Sometimes the best course of action is to push forward with a full head of steam, taking care to the make the ride worth every second. Derrickson does a masterful job keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. The super 8 movies are about as creepy and nasty as it gets. They look completely authentic and unnerving. Then there is the music. The score sends the film onto another level. A good horror movie will use its soundtrack to improve on itself and Sinister might be one of the best examples.

I may be a little late to the party on seeing this one, considering the sequel is less than three months away, but the wait is worth it in every way. Sinister is now firmly in my top ten horror movies of all time.",1433894400,,2092,4.454308093994778

5443008,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I've seen more horror movies than I could remember to write here. I'm hard to scare now. Sinister got under my skin like few recent horror movies have. The creep factor is off the charts due to the excellent cinematography,grip-your-seat score and unforgettable images. The movie is dark, figuratively and literally and I still don't know exactly why it was decided that the house interiors would be so dark, as if the family didn't believe in overhead light, but somehow it works. It puts me on edge when I can't see things clearly. My eyes are moving around a scene checking rooms,corners,windows, hoping to catch something,hoping I'm not surprised by something and maybe that was the intention. The films within the film are better left not mentioned because you just need to see them, no spoilers. All the actors commit themselves well to the material although Ethan Hawke is not a very likeable protagonist. as he is clearly willing to sell his family out to regain fame. The villian creation is quite spooky but more so when he's in the background or appears in a photo. This is a brutal film, not cause its gory, because it isn't, but because of how impressively it presents the familiar vulnerability of children to dark forces and parental neglect and how they stuff feelings only to act them out. Highly recommended, especially with the lights off, but be forewarned that it might be hard to shake it after you've seen it.",1433808000,,1432,4.778225806451613

5443027,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a one hit wonder in the writing world as a true crime author whose stories have somewhat made him an enemy with law enforcement. His latest book has drawn him to a town in a new house where a family was murdered, and their youngest daughter Stephanie (Victoria Leigh) disappeared. To the chagrin of the police sheriff and townsfolk, he chooses to pursue this story anyway for fame and fortune, but doesn't realize this was a story he should have avoided as advised. -summary

Released in 2012 and directed by Scott Derrickson, a director with a less than impressive track record as far as I'm concerned. Sinister is a supernatural character driven horror movie that attempts to add devious twists to old ideas, and along the way manages to generate a few chills and frights. At its heart though, it's more of a character driven story that focuses on the character Ellison Oswalt.

The plot follows Ellison as he attempts to uncover the whereabouts of the missing child Stephanie whom police are convinced is dead. He finds a box with Super 8 film and plenty of titled and dated footage; the videos appear to be snuff films, as he watches up to five families brutally murdered and at the site of these killings, a man dressed in black with a demonic face appears.

Sinister relies on two things; it's massive build up to revelations, and Ellison's obsession with this footage. Ellison is accused by his wife of putting his work ahead of her and their two children which is clearly true. He's not exactly a bad person, but it seems as if he makes it his duty to uncover the truth of what is going on. This results in an interesting enough story about either a cult, a supernatural entity, or both, that abducts children. There is plenty of information delivered to rope the viewer into the story; the chilling atmosphere along with weird occurrences taking place in the house and with his family enhances the fright and uneasiness quite a bit.

While the movie handles those clichd scares well enough with nice surprises; the problem is that some of the stuff quickly becomes overplayed despite being very important to the story and thus loses effectiveness. The film takes place in the dark quite often, and it works very well with its build up some times leading to either twisted or flat outcomes.

Sinister is definitely not a slasher film despite disturbing footage and even being labeled as one. It has slasher elements but this is supernatural, haunted house if anything. There is no real gore to speak of since those killings in the footage either reveal very little or next to nothing. The film's goal is clearly to stimulate imagination through tension, atmosphere, and the fear of having an idea something is going to happen instead of actually happening, which will always be good if done right.

Sinister wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't for the acting and smart use of the cast. Juliet Rylance as Tracy Oswalt with her loveable European accent is quite believable as the ticked off wife, whom isn't the least bit happy about being inside of that house. James Ransome as the deputy added quite a bit in developing the plot, and I liked his purpose in helping Oswalt in the first place; but it's Hawke whom shines best here as the obsessed man needing to know what happens, and later on when his family becomes more important to him.

I definitely won't spoil the ending because although some things felt obvious it was still something unexpected, but for some reason I always thought that this movie was nothing more than a foundation to a long running franchise; the fact there's a sequel due out later this year confirms to me that my suspicions were correct. I feel there's plenty of mystery to explore with this premise, and it feels as if this movie scratched the surface and there's just more to tell. In any case, Sinister is an above average horror movie that has a fair amount of jump scares and characters worth caring about. Now do I feel it's among the greatest horror movies ever? Not at all, but it's better than a lot of that shovel-ware floating around in the genre.

Pros: Nicely paced with strong characters and chills

Cons: The scares kind of lose effectiveness, jury is out on that ending",1432339200,,4259,4.690763052208835

Great suspense and mood.  The movie follows the lives of a true-crime novelist and his family, who move into a house where the former family was murdered, except for their daughter, who is missing.  The author (Ethan Hawke) intends to investigate and write about the crime.  Along the way, the story line juxtaposes the author's fact-finding mentality with the fact that his new home is clearly haunted (he does not believe in the paranormal before living in this house).  LOVED the ending; not expected at all (by me).  One caution - the movie is largely filmed at night (or during the night), so you really need to watch it in the dark or in a dimly lit room to catch everything clearly; I've noticed this with a lot of recent horror films.  Works in theaters, not so much at home (or on my Kindle, where I purchased it).",1429660800,,1111,4.58080808080808

5443126,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Quick story recap: Crime Novelist moves into a house where a family was murdered to investigate and write another novel. He finds a box of movies and things start to happen.  This film reminded me of ""The Ring"" with a few elements modified to make it seem fresh.  Even with that in mind, it still has a freaky tense vibe to it.  There are a few cheap scares in there, only would have been cheaper if the word ""Boo"" was yelled as someone popped out.  But it mostly relied on creepiness and images of murders.

Ethan Hawke did a good job as the crime novelist.  I think he played it pretty perfectly as a former star writer who is desperate for another hit.  He seemed pretty spot on as he becomes shaken up by events occurring.  Everyone did an ok job however, I thought Juliet Rylance, the wife, could have been stronger in some portions of the movie.

Overall the film is average.  There were some cool cinematography moments like the way they show what Ethan Hawke was watching on the film through the reflection in his glasses.  I thought there were some hokey things I wish they would take out or change (kids doing the ""Shhh"" thing.)

5443133,4,B00AJLHUYO,"We have a relatively sparse, though carefully chosen, horror collection all of it being psychological rather than slasher gore fests. Without doubt, `The Grudge' is still our scariest film (nothing should come for you under the duvet - it's just wrong) but `Sinister' comes pretty close, probably on a par with `The Ring'.

The story revolves around a stubborn and selfish author struggling to write another true crime mystery ten years after his last and only best seller. He drags his poor family to live at the site of an unexplained family murder and, after finding some of super 8 films in the loft he starts to investigate the sinister goings-on. This could quite easily have been a cobbling together of stock-in-trade horror shocks, but the assured direction and excellent cast (including Vincent D'Onofrio's unaccredited cameo) create an absorbingly creepy atmosphere while the carefully managed pace and tension make for some splendid edge-of-your-seat jump moments (and there are plenty).

It is all very silly of course but that doesn't stop this being one of the best horrors of its type around and is well deserved of a place in our select little horror collection.",1421452800,,1178,5.06701030927835

5443145,4,B00AJLHUYO,"There are so many films like 'Sinister' being churned out, it would be easy to dismiss it as one more by-the-numbers haunted house flick. It manages to succeed where 99% of them fail, however, creating a sense of menace that builds steadily, with genuinely frightening moments and a satisfyingly horrific conclusion. But it's got plenty of faults, too. You will have your intelligence insulted on several occasions, unless you're one of the microcephalic crowd any aspiring box-office conqueror is forced to pander to (since you're taking the time to read and research before viewing, I'll assume you aren't); there will be creepy children drawing creepy pictures and wearing creepy pancake makeup, and every scary moment will be artificially augmented with sudden explosions of noise and music. Whatever. Any horror fans out there, regardless how discriminating their tastes might be, will have made their peace with such compromises long ago. This is not a horror classic, by any means, but it has flashes of inspiration. If you start watching 'Sinister' looking to make fun of a horror flick, you won't have any problems finding material. But if you go into it with your critical voice on 'mute', it's solid entertainment. My suggestion for anyone who fears they will be way too smart to enjoy 'Sinister', but are still going to watch it for some weird, sinister reason, is to get really drunk. If that option seems too extreme, try Quaaludes, barbiturates, or some other rarely prescribed drug that rock stars of the 1960's liked to kill themselves with. {NOTE: I'm obviously joking about the Quaaludes and whatnot, I just like the fontifical beauty of the name 'Quaaludes'. Try something safe instead, like Heroin).

True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves his unsuspecting family into a house that was the scene of a quadruple homicide, hoping to recharge his fading literary career. As they're moving in, he discovers a box in the attic that shouldn't be there. It contains a Super-8 film projector and several tins of reel-to-reel footage. Each film has a banal home movie title like 'Hanging Out', 'Family BBQ' or 'Pool Party', but contains footage of a family being murdered by the camera-man. Regardless what your feelings are about 'The Ring' (and the Japanese original, Ringu), the deadly videotape that was so central to the plot had to be deeply disturbing, and it was; similarly, there is an eerie, unnatural quality to every frame of Super-8 film in 'Sinister', and every time he turns on the projector, it inspires an anxious excitement. Like 'The Ring', a lot of the unease can be attributed to the soundtrack that accompanies the film; but while VHS tapes have sound, Super-8 does not.

Oswalt makes the decision to keep this discovery to himself; considering the fact that this means with-holding apparently vital evidence relating to a series of multiple homicides, this seems like a really bad idea. Ethan Hawke does an excellent job of making Oswalt believable and sympathetic, despite the terrible choices he makes at every critical juncture... the first one being to move into the house where an entire family was killed, without telling his wife. I didn't really buy the notion of a wife who lets her husband choose when and where they move, even letting him pick out the house - especially when he has a history of selecting prior homes based on their proximity to the grisly crime he's investigating. If Stephen King has taught us anything -- and in most cases he probably hasn't -- it's that when you're dealing with a thoroughly fictitious demon/deity that eats children, you need to make the human drama believable. {Also, it's a small detail, but the attic doesn't match the house; it belongs to a house with a roof that has gable ends, instead of the cottage-ends the exterior shots depict. And while I don't know Pennsylvania well, I'm fairly certain it has cold winters, making the apparent absence of insulation ill-advised; there doesn't even seem to be a thin layer in the ceiling, between the trusses and under the ancient-looking attic floor-boards. Whatever.}

The protagonist doesn't believe in the supernatural, which is fine, neither do I; still, after the third or fourth inexplicable and terrifying event, I'd have to make a serious reappraisal of my beliefs or my sanity. But Oswalt's determination to redeem his literary reputation with something as powerful as his first celebrated work of non-fiction pushes him to extremes. His version of Truman Capote's `In Cold Blood' or Norman Mailer's `The Executioner's Song' -- `Kentucky Blood' -- established him as a minor star, dedicated to exposing injustice. His subsequent work, however, resulted in controversy and negative publicity after a killer went free (likely inspired by Mailer's own experiences; he was instrumental in convincing a parole board to release a talented inmate with a violent history, and was held accountable by many when this parolee killed again).

Even though the reels were found together, the crime scenes contain the same cryptic symbols, and the films were all apparently made by the same person or people, a great deal of time has elapsed between each incident, with the first dating back to the sixties, and the last one in 2011. As the proof keeps piling up that a supernatural entity is behind the killings, and that his own family might be the next link in the chain, Ellison doesn't get worried enough, given the crazy crap he's witnessed. There are plenty of ominous clues that don't bode well for the Oswalt's: in all of the murders, one child escapes the carnage, but disappears; their son has a habit of doing extremely creepy s**t while sleeping, like crawling into a cardboard box and then moaning, his eyes glazed over like a corpse; their daughter likes to draw on the walls, and whenever a kid picks up a crayon in a horror movie, it's never good.

`Sinister' is not unique or original... in any way, really. It's predictable at times, and unconvincing at others. But it's also one of the most genuinely unsettling horror films I've seen in the last couple years, alongside standouts in mainstream supernatural suspense like `The Ring' (you could call `Sinister' a cross between `The Ring' and `1408'), `The Grudge', and `Paranormal Activity 3' (I wasn't that big a fan of the original, the second was tedious, but `PA3' was great). In the hands of another director, with a different cast, `Sinister' could have been a completely mediocre and forgettable film. It's got the creepy kids, creepy Crayola drawings featuring creepy imaginary friends, ghostly photographs, and the obligatory `Google-search' scene (which has replaced the `Library-search' scene, with dusty, leather-bound tomes of occult lore and micro-fiche archives of decades-old newspaper articles about murders and suicides). But all the tricks and tropes that misfire in other films successfully ignite in `Sinister'. Even as I was shaking my head at the silliness or familiarity, I would suddenly forget my misgivings, thanks to the overwhelmingly disturbing atmosphere. And the booze, of course.

Sometimes a scary movie lacks originality or doesn't do its job which is to SCARE YOU. ""Sinister"" is full of shocking surprises, and the twist at the end will leave you speechless. Ethan Hawke has always gotten a bad rap over the years when it comes to his acting ability. Hawke is a good actor. He has a nervous, jumpy energy that some people find frustrating. I think he's very convincing in this film. His character in ""Sinister"" is driven and obsessive. This film is definitely not intended for children. I'm in my early 30's and I was TERRIFIED of some of the scenes. The beginning scene was very unnerving. Not for the faint of heart. If you're looking for a modern horror flick that will make you think and rattle your bones a bit, then ""Sinister"" is the perfect film to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Just make sure not to watch it before you go to sleep at night. It might give you nightmares. Just saying. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1417564800,6,1099,4.445544554455446

There were several scenes that were just too dimly lit to really see what was going on, and back tracking to make sure I had completely caught what had happened was distracting me from the intensity of the experience of viewing this film. It was quite eerie from beginning to end, and I would wager most viewers would find it extremely frightening and disturbing.

5443205,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Four nooses, one family, one missing child. The opening scene to the chilling film Sinister is one to catch the attention of any audience. The director Scott Derrickson shows mystery and fear through the flawless acting and the enhancing plot to make this movie a highly rated film.
Ellison, a writer with a young family, is in search for another best selling book so he decides to move his family into a house where the family was found hung from one tree and their little daughter went missing. With unexpected hauntings from the house and spirits, Ellison has to discover a train of murders and kidnappings all resulting to one answer. He is surprised to find an old box of footage of countless murders all resulting in a missing child. Ellison, realizing he is on the hunt of something much bigger than what he imagined, goes on it with great ambition and drive. Im going to write the best book that anyone has ever read. Ellison claims to his daughter as she questions why they keep moving. The investigation will cause great panic and distortion in Ellison and his familys lives. The mysterious storyline of a man hunting crime will have everyone who is watching to be on the edge of their seats.
Although Ellison sells the creepy and haunting feel for the movie, it is really the two kids in the film that play a dramatic role in selling the whole spirit vibe. The sons character is enhanced because living in the house brings great stress to him and causes him to have severe night tares. His terrible night tares are caused by bullying at school because him and his family moved into the house. No one is aware of the houses history besides Ellison until the boy becomes teased. This emphasizes the fear the house brings to the boy in not only an emotional way but a physical way. The daughter is also an important aspect in illustrating the illusion. Derrickson makes her draw on the walls of the new house, which eventually will create a big twist in the entire movie. Clare Fowley (the little girl) plays a very important part. With her suspicious smile and her appetite to impress, she is always up to something.
Along the lines of a killer storyline the feel of being watched is a common theme used throughout the film. Derrickson makes the entire audience convinced that absolutely anything can happen at any given time. The technique he uses is in the music. Each time a murder is being taken place on the video tape the same song is on. The familiar song and beat will stay in the audiences head all night. The haunting pitches and quick second camera angles really emphasize the entire movie to being suspenseful. Derrickson relies on flashing lights also to show that no one knows whats to come.
Not only does Derrickson use music and camera angles to emphasize the horror movie but he also uses excellent acting as a key aspect in making the movie the horror film of the century. If you're a horror movie buff or just someone looking for an excellent storyline, Sinister will never allow you to sleep again. This film is very unique with the skeptical character outlines and the haunting background. Sinister will forever be one of the greatest horror movies of all time.",1413590400,,3191,4.639575971731449

5443208,1,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie starts out pretty well.  The initial premise is promising and it carries a decent amount of suspense for roughly the first half, even in spite of the fact that apparently the main character (played by  Ethan Hawk) lives in a house with no functioning lights.  However, once the actual underlying premise is unearthed by Vincent D'Onofrio, the movie takes a marked downturn into ridiculous and cerebrally insulting jump-scares and hyperbole irrationality.  By the end, I was starting to get irritated with the insidious insults flung at my intellect, and the ending was so bad, so unbelievably horrifically meta-bad, that I don't think I'm going to be watching any movies for a while.  Inane, insipid, and downright dumb main premise; case-in-point for ""jumping the shark"".

5443216,3,B00AJLHUYO,"If I were braking into directing the one type of movie I would not do is horror. Why? Because you are forced to take your actors and make them do stupid things to create fear. The minute Ethan Hawke would have turned on those lights in any room in their home the mood would have been lost.  However this movie also employes creepy back ground noises and a great musical sound track to help with the fear factor. But was I scared? Not one bit. Did the movie make me jump? Yes it did but is making me jump really scaring me or am I simply reacting to an abrupt moment? Also is using children as the ghost or the eval ones, a cheap form of horror? Yes I did enjoy watching the movie but I was not moved into fear. Three and a half stars for a good creepy story with good acting. To this day the scariest movies are those that use the eval in humans and make these people scare us by their demented sick deeds not by the victim going into that dark, dark basement like an idiot.  The other form of true fear is the imagination as science in today's world has educated most of us past ghost and monsters.

 Back in the early sixties there was this thirty minute show the name I do not recall. The victim was in the hospital and would wake up to each joint of their body being removed, one at a time, till just the torso remained. Not one drop of blood was spilled it was my mind that filled in the blanks. The last scene the person or doctor that did all this stood in the door way with a tray loaded with nasty looking tools and a butane blow torch and he said, now that we are at this point it is time for the fun to really begin. Then the show ends right there. Our minds are lead in the direction as to what is going to happen but we fill in the blanks. Now that is scary.",1412726400,,1771,4.008498583569405

5443262,2,B00AJLHUYO,"Some movies are either boring or bad.  This one's both.

While Sinister tries to mix mystery, drama and horror all into one pot, the results are less than satisfactory.  Ethan Hawke is a really good actor and while I wouldn't say his acting is necessarily bad here, it's severely underutilized.  He's boring for the most part.  He plays a very boring laidback character.  He plays the role of a book writer who sits around trying to figure out the mystery of a family who all hanged themselves from a tree branch in the backyard.  Over and over for *over* for an hour he looks over the clues, secluding himself away from his family in the backroom and only talking to them occasionally for trivial family matters.  The local police department of this small town are either really clueless or they give the impression they'd rather not bring up the death of the family because they present no motivation whatsoever and feel like they shouldn't have even been written into the script.

Now here comes the bad- everything else.  There's absolutely nothing even remotely frightening about this movie.  The horror relies entirely on Ethan Hawke freaking himself out whenever he hears a mysterious sound in the house late at nihgt so he goes around in search of the reason behind it.  The snake in the attic resulting in poor Ethan falling through the floor is a pleasant moment.  Another good moment comes when his son is hiding in a cardboard box and crawls out of it backwards like an Exorcist creature.  I liked that moment because it tricked the viewers for a moment into thinking it was a monster instead of Ethan's son.  Otherwise it seems every time a suspenseful moment is about to come, it quickly dissolves and shifts in another direction where Ethan argues with his wife concerning their children reading his grisly murder stories.  The movie avoids delivering scares at every angle oddly enough and relies on a weak atmosphere to carry it through.  There's a really big unexpected twist at the end that's admirable, but so far-fetched that it's almost laughable and lacks suspense due to the lackluster, uninteresting story we've had to persevere up to this point.

So yeah.  A movie that's at least 30 minutes overlong, Ethan Hawke scaring himself into believing the house his family is staying in is haunted, and oh, when we finally do see the demonic kids guess what they look like?  Children in Halloween costumes.  No creativity whatsoever in making them look authentically scary.  Hilarious how every time Ethan turns around while roaming the hallways one night he's supposed to barely miss a glimpse of the ghost kids in his field of vision except... it's hilarious the movie pretends he didn't turn around in time when it's clear to us he DID turn around in time to spot them.  Applying the finishing touches on a very mediocre movie right there.

I can't recommend such an average attempt at horror.  I really can't.  Is Hollywood even trying anymore when it comes to horror?",1408320000,2,2991,4.79296875

When Ethan Hawke's character decides to write another true murder best seller, he moves his family into the town it happened in. He doesn't tell them though that the murders actually occurred in the very house they are now living in and that's when things begin to happen. Without spoiling too much for the viewer (because the ending will blow you out of the water) Hawke's character finds a box full of 8mm films and a projector that shows many murders that occurred in the house and others also. He also discovers the killer. A character that could easily continue in a new franchise. There is already a sequel in the works. Get this one and watch it in the dark.

5443283,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister is one of those Horror Movies that is odd.  On one hand, it should not have done as well as it should but it did.  The way they set up the movie should not have worked but it did.  But the overall effect is ""Creepy"" but not sinister as the film title implies.
  The storyline is about a True crime novelist looking to make his next GREAT bestseller after a long dry spell.  He moves his family into the house where the previous family was murdered by mass hanging.  Except for their daughter, who mysteriously disappeared & is presumed dead.  The Novelist (Played by Ethan hawke) finds a box full of 8mm film in the attic & gradually throughout the film pieces together, what he presumes, is a ""Serial Killer"" who has been killing families for over 40 years.  And always kidnapping one of the Children of the slain Familiies.  Through his research, he finds that it is something far more hideous than a ""Serial Killer"".  In the end, his family becomes the next family of something far more ""Sinister""
  Sinister combines a regular movie with strong elements of the now popular ""Found Footage"" genre.  While it isn't quite effective to pull it off, the movie does manage to pull off a minor trumph in making the movie disturbingly distointed to throw the viewer off.  I did enjoy this movie.

5443296,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Okay, let me get one thing out of the way; except for a section where there was a power outage, WHY THE HECK DOESN'T HE JUST TURN ON THE LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE? Yes, the director wanted a different, darker look than a standard Hollywood film but it really pushed my suspended disbelief to the limit when, after several disturbing events, our protagonist wanders around in the near-pitch-black seemingly just to provide shadows for things to potentially hide in. Come ON! This was distracting for me, but, I feel this film gets so many things right in such a singular, tightly-reined way, my criticisms fall into the ""well, nobody's perfect"" zone. I'd give it 5 stars were it not for some distractingly dodgy makeup and some clunky, talky, and in my opinion unnecessary information-dumping. I found any plot holes to be small. Having said that, I was enthralled by this film. The Super 8 footage is INCREDIBLY DISTURBING and admirably this is due to what the viewer does NOT see. I'm still haunted by it days after watching the film. There are a blessed minimum of silly jump scares and overt cgi effects. However, it's Ethan Hawke who makes this whole thing work. He is SO inside the skin of his very rather unsympathetic character it's amazing. There is a scene where his character argues with his wife which is OUTSTANDINGLY real... just blew me away, and it could've gone so wrong had he not pitched his performance so well. Wisely, the action is mostly focused on the interior of the houses. The various red herrings are quite well-done without seeming unrealistic. And, THANK GOODNESS for once the whole thing doesn't climax with some stupid, clich special effects fireball ""confrontation"". Dread is ratcheted up very, very slowly to excellent effect. Personally, I felt things were explained a bit too much towards the end, but, it was such a different sort of ending I was able to set this aside. The cinematography is incredible without drawing to much attention to itself. I recommend this film with the strong warning that the ""home movie"" scenes were VERY UPSETTING to watch. There was a reason for this, instead being pure excessive indulgence, but, I hadn't been this bothered by this sort of approach since way back in HENRY, PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. Also, very terrible things are shown or implied to happen to children, so, if that's something you have difficulty setting aside afterward, you might want to skip this one.",1404950400,6,2438,4.821002386634845

The first half of the movie is engaging, and when Ethan Hawk's character finds a bunch of old murder videos and starts to investigate them, it makes you want to keep watching.  It keeps you hanging for awhile.  As the story progresses and the Juggalos and Juggalettes appear, it spirals into nonsense and then - unfortunately - the ending becomes very predictable.

There is blood but it is not lingered upon and even one particularly disturbing scene does not show the actual death.  The musical scores played throughout fits well with the movie and the moods.  For me there was one ""jump"" scene that I was unprepared for.  Although I rather saw it coming close to the end, the ending is kick ass!  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you enjoy horror but want something that isn't full of gore and guts.  Sinister is creepy and unsettling.

A true crime writer gets too close to his latest book subject.  He winds up moving his family into a house where an awful multiple murder was committed, thinking this will spur him to a great book and revive his faded career.  Well, that is his big mistake.

Well .... I made myself not watch it for so long, I just ... I didn't want to see it but finally broke since so many of my fellow horror fans seemed to dig it. Soooo I just finished it .... its yet another Boogie man film, with an everyone dies at the end ending, Yes Im spoiling it for you so that if you have not watched this drug out play on possessed children that has been done to frigging death, I will have saved you time and money, as well as that feeling of having wasted an evening doing something else ... anything else.

***THE STORY IN A NUT SHELL*** This is not the first time I have seen an Malevolent-esq entity-esq using our technology to fill there evil ends, this one seems to enjoy 8 mm footage. Crazy things happen, Ethan Hawk lies to his wife, they run away, the thing chases them, we see the children kill the parents because they are either A. Possessed by the entity or B. They have nothing else better to tie the film together with, Little girl kills family, and is taken by entity ... roll credits and high five for making a quick buck on those who don't know any better.

I am normally not the type to give spoilers, but honestly, after watching this, I kinda felt that by doing so I was in fact doing a public service. I noticed a lot of peps like this film and for those of you who do, much love. It takes all kinds, there is a movie out there for everyone, One of my favorite series is Phantasm and I know not every one digs those, so to each his own, so Im not trying to hate on those who do like this ..... movie, Im simply giving my opinion and (I hope) warning those who may feel the same way.

5443355,5,B00AJLHUYO,"The scariest film I have seen in recent years, Sinister is filled with disturbing yet artful images and music (much of that music borrowed from various metal groups). For such a low budget everything looks amazing; they made great use of their money. The few effects work great and the acting is superb. Repeated viewings can be very rewarding as the film is packed with little clues that foreshadow the final revelations. The villain is truly memorable and disturbing, and deserves to go down in movie monster history. I find it somewhat unfortunate that sequels are being planed as I think Sinister works best as a stand-alone, but perhaps I'll be surprised.

For those of you who complain about the protagonist never turning on the light: when someone is paranoid enough, they fear that turning on a light will make them an easier target for someone unseen. Unfortunate that it only comes up in the commentaries, but trying to put that explanation in the film would have been very awkward.

And, in general, the filming techniques that were used to enhance the dark and foreboding feel of the movie were impressive.

Of course, I tend to be slightly optimistic about a movie's outcome no matter how dark and horrific the movie is--ha, ha.  And, believe me, this is dark.

5443384,2,B00AJLHUYO,"The plot and story had a lot of potential, but instead of turning it into something like 1408, it relied very heavily on jump scares to bring the scare factor out. The sound track seemed a bit out of place, and instead of trying to tie the movie together, it seemed to really just pull it apart.

Think VHS minus the unexpected turns, 1408 minus the psychological thrills, or MAMA minus the suspense.

Most of the movie focuses on Ethan Hawk starring off into space thinking of things contemplating the oddly placed music - could have been a very good psychological thriller - instead we get a movie in a movie: we see the psychological thriller taking place in the mind of Ethan without getting to be drawn into the thriller itself.

Characters were relatively bland, and only one scene really set the emotional context for Ethan and his wife - other than that, there was no real connection to the characters, nor did you feel anything as the plot ran up to its forgone conclusion. Slow motion train wreck.

Again great premise, but I think this was churned out with a lack of focus on getting it done right - and it could have been done magnificently. It's an interesting watch, and will appeal to some viewers, but those looking for intense horror/thriller or psychological mind games can look somewhere else.",1394582400,,1312,4.642241379310345

5443399,1,B00AJLHUYO,"I thought about giving this movie three stars. But when I really thought about it, what I could not get past was how much I did actually like this story, and was truly frightened by it, until a certain moment in this film. And that was when it became clear that the crux of the mystery, was not human but supernatural.

And it is not obvious at first. This film's plot could actually make one believe, that some unknown creep was wandering around. But when the supernatural aspect was revealed, it made everything that happened afterwards seem silly and easily escapable.

I would never tell someone to not buy this movie. I would recommend renting it.",1391904000,4,652,4.612068965517241

He starts tying together a series of murders that are depicted in the aforementioned footage. I could go on and tell you the rest of the movie, but why would you need to watch it then?

All in all, its a pretty scary movie. A few jumps here and there, but in my opinion, that isn't where the scariest content (of any movie) lies. Whenever a movie gives you goose bumps, its a success in my book. That's the reason we watch this stuff, right? Just catching a glimpse of Mr. Babylonian Demon Guy, was enough to get me thinking, ""Now this is the movie I've been looking for."" Too bad it poops out at the end. It kind of seemed like they ran out of time or money, or ideas. Hence the four-star rating. And now I'm off to furiously masterbate and contemplate what happened to my life. Somewhere I messed up.

5443411,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I will agree with many reviewers here.  The movie is scary, creepy, suspenseful, well done horror movie.  But the ending sucks.  You have all this build-up, the slow, methodical pace of the movie, the tension.  And it's over. In the space of a few minutes, the writer gets additional information about the other murders, sees more of the movies, and, the surprise ending occurs and it's over.  No great scary stuff, no creepiness, no final battle, no tension. No nothing but the end. It's as if they stopped making the movie suddenly. Maybe they ran out of film. A very good movie with a rushed, unsatisfying end. It's as if they decide to throw a curve to make it a surprise ending with this thought; Lets make source of the horror something innocent, out of the blue. Just because it is a surprise does not make it good. Here would be another surprise ending: Santa Claus did it. What? Yeah it's like that.",1390867200,,908,4.54601226993865
5443412,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I figured out the key plot point fairly early in the movie, but despite that, it was worth watching the rest of the movie to find out exactly how the plot would play out. It was pretty satisfying.

As with most horror movies, there were plenty of moments when the characters' actions defied reason. Ethan Hawke, the main character, is a true crime writer who wrote a successful book years ago. His more recent books have been flops, and he's out to score big one more time so he can provide for his family and continue to avoid a 9-to-5 existence. He moves his family to a town where an unexplained disappearance happened and seeks out to find answers ... which are pretty much handed to him in the form of a box of old home movies, which show the ghastly deaths of one family after another. Despite the scary nature of the material, Hawke continues to work alone in the middle of the night, when everything is scariest. And despite having all these death films, which he should turn over to police, he decides to keep them secret and try to use them to expose a heretofore unknown serial killer.

The tension ratchets up, and ... I'll leave the rest for you to watch.

The ending is unsatisfying and expected, but it's kind of a fun ride getting there. Unlike most found footage movies, this one is actually kind of scary.",1390694400,,1323,4.458677685950414

5443433,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I am always on the lookout for good horror. Despite my best efforts, I rarely come across a movie that scares me. I found one.

Sinister tells the story of Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime writer whose best work was ten years ago. In an effort to get his mojo back, he moves his family to a small town in the middle of nowhere to chronicle the murder of four people and the disappearance of the familys youngest daughter. And in a move that the local sheriff notes is in bad taste, he decides to move into the house previously occupied by the murdered family. Did I mention the family was murdered in the back yard, hanged from the branch of a particularly sturdy tree?

Things start to go hairy when Ellison discovers a box of Super-8 films in the attic of his home, films that shouldnt be there (we are treated to a crime scene photo showing an empty attic). One of the films depicts the murder of the people Ellison is investigating. But when Ellison watches some of the other films in the boxspanning several decadeshe finds that each one depicts another family, and another murder. But when Ellison makes out the image of the killer in one of the films, thats when things take a turn for the worst.

I tell you what, this movie is freaky-deaky from the word go. From the very first frame, its go time. I am reminded of the similarly named Insidious, a movie that was wonderfully horrific until the last 15 minutes or so, when it sorta falls apart. This movie doesnt fall apart. And the thing is, it almost never lets up. There are very few opportunities to relax. The Super 8 films harken back to Peeping Tom, the excellent 1960 horror film that was so far ahead of its time that it destroyed the directors career. But the heart of the movie is purely supernatural and altogether unsettling. The fact that the family dynamic is so well-established only makes it worse. I can honestly say that Sinister is one of the scariest movies I have seen since The Ring.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good scare.

5 Stars

Bonus: Sinister manages to breathe new life into the jump scare as well. There is one scene where the lead character sees something that makes him jump out of his chair. I almost fell out of mine.

Bonus, with a spoiler: So I always say, if you end up in a place where something crazy is going on, just move. Yeah, didn't quite work in this one",1388793600,,2370,4.409610983981693
5443434,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I'm not one to generally get scared by movies, but this one really did a number on me. It literally made me turn the lights back on to finish watching it. Some reviews say that the plot doesn't add up or it's predictable, and to be honest, some of that is true. BUT, the great thing about supernatural horror is that the plot doesn't HAVE to make sense to scare you. It's fiction. Anything goes. I've always been an Ethan Hawke fan and the supporting actors did a great job. It's not one of those B-movies where you can't sit through the crap dialogue to even get to the heart of the movie. It was well written, and well portrayed. If you enjoy watching horror movies for the pure horror factor and not to analyze the storyline itself, then I would definitely recommend this one.",1388707200,,779,4.379310344827586

Typically, the acting and background music scores lend to the ""spookiness"" of this type of flick ... not so much so in ""Sinister"", though. Lacking in this movie is the background music that draws the viewer in during potentially suspenseful scenes and Ethan Hawke misses out on several opportunities to express genuine fear over what he has discovered.

5443440,3,B00AJLHUYO,"I've seen a lot of horror films and have been a fan ever since I was 6 or 7 years old when I stayed up late and watched the great Dr Shock on late night TV in the Philadelphia area around 1969.

Dr Shock played all the classics Dracula. Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man and so on. I learned from the best, but horror has taken a turn for the worse over the years with generally bad stories and zero atmosphere substituting gore and jolt shocks to compensate for true horror.

Sinister is a decent little horror film filled with creepy atmosphere and some good scares.  Sure if's predictable and the folks living in this house are way too stupid, but that seems to be the norm anymore. Is it a great horror film? No, but it is pretty effective watching this with the lights out.

The old film reels with the  murder sequences on them are the best part of the film and the actors are certainly way above average for this type of film. It's not The Exorcist but then again few films are......",1388361600,,994,4.294117647058823

5443443,1,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie is a collection of the stupidest decisions you've ever seen in your life. No sane person would ever allow things to get to the point that was reached in the movie. Ethen Hawke plays the most near sighted true crime author you've ever encountered. He also lives in the most bizarrely lit house you've ever seen. Every decision he makes is the wrong one. Dreadfully wrong. Painfully wrong. Embarrassingly WRONG. Should you subject yourself to this waste of time you will find your eyes rolling about as hard as you've ever rolled them in your life. You will come to resent Hawke and his idiotic decisions and unfortunately you will not even enjoy the eventual punishment he receives for being so mind blowingly stupid. This movie is something you inflict on a person you hate. This movie is the screenwriting 101 final you give an F. This movie is exhibit A in the court case against terrible movies.

It's unfortunate because the premise had promise. The execution is where it failed. Making the protagonist so retardedly blind to everything around him was hard to watch and infuriating. It's hard to not scream at the screen while watching Hawke willfully make the stupidest decisions possible over and over and over again. You have been warned.",1388102400,5,1256,4.814814814814815

There's plenty of standard scares & things going bump in the night but still manages to over top the very over hyped ""Paranormal Activity"" & ""Insidious"" movies simply because Sinister is very subtle in it's approach & never tries to go over the top for simple shock value.

5443450,4,B00AJLHUYO,"This one has more than the usual scares. As with most horror you have to buy into the premise but once you do, yowza, it gets scary. The use of 8mm film during the movie is very effective and add a nice chill throughout. The use of the 8mm gives a sense of reality to the story. Some of you will have trouble sleeping after this one but isn't that kind of what we are looking for in this type of movie?",1387584000,2,402,3.9146341463414633

The movie is about a writer who keeps trying to find a killer and actually moves into a house where one of the murders too place, without telling his family. Something keeps interfering w/his work, though, and the movie is all about that.
I wouldn't recommend it 'cause I hated the ending and just........ I'd rather see a movie similar to this with more explanation..... I can't say more 'cause I'd spoil it.",1387584000,,459,4.679012345679013

5443458,5,B00AJLHUYO,This movie has the creapiest atmosphere I have seen in a long time.  I don't understand why people where confused by the plot. It is explained very clearly.  I think the problem is that this is a true supernatural horror movie not a real life horror movie.  This is not crazy killer goes on a killing spree.  This is more old school creature fears.  Watch at night and you will be scared.,1387065600,,388,4.333333333333333
5443459,4,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie really SCARED me! The build up of suspense was really good, so when the scary parts came, I was terrified. It lost a bit of the sheer horror during the last 1/3 which was a let-down.  At one point, I went into the next room and the music and sound effects alone were enough to continue the feeling of horror.  A writer was researching some murders and moved his family into one of the houses where one of the families was killed in a horrible way.  In the attic, he finds films of the actual murders.  Very scary things begin to happen at night in that house which come together with the music and script that fill you with dreadup until the last 1/3 of the movie.  Still worth watching.",1386892800,,698,4.257575757575758

5443464,4,B00AJLHUYO,Wow! I enjoy scary movies and also find it very difficult to find good ones. This one is great. I was genuinely scared for the first time in years. The first few minutes are creepy and just set the mood. I actually had to stop it once and watch some live tv to calm my nerves because I was watching it alone in the middle of the night. Not a masterpiece but worth your time if you like horror.,1386028800,2,393,3.9873417721518987

5443466,3,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie started off with an interesting plot and some great suspense. I thought it had a lot of potential but towards the middle/end it got cheesy. [Spoiler] The ghosts of the children killed it for me. All the suspense that was built up faded away every time I saw one of the ghost children look into the camera and throw up the ""shhhh"" sign. It was hard to take this movie seriously after that. The ending was about as cheesy as it gets.

2) Good use of audio to generate viewer discomfort.
3) An ending that could be seen coming from a mile away, but with no ability to stop it (it was obvious the characters were hosed from the moment the viewer recognized where the movie was headed).

I'll try not to give the whole thing away but the face you see on the dvd cover and in the previews is pretty damn scary during the movie.  I'm not going to lie I was pretty freaked out by it.  So I was expecting some really scary s*** at the end.  And all the murders are horrific so you're thinking, ""Man what a psycho!  DUDE GET OUT OF THERE!""  Then at the end you find out what ties it all together and you're like really? ANd then you find out who has been committing the murders and you're like, REALLY???? COME ONNNNN.

5443474,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I like horror movies and have watched thousands in my life so far.  Very few in the genre are what I would consider to be well thought out with a good plot and/or story.  Most are not original and present nothing out of the ordinary.  I like them even when most of what I've seen are what I would rank 2 or 3 stars, average and below average.  But, the ones that are done well with effort put into the story and acting, it's worth wading through all the average to find a few gems.  Ethan Hawke is a serious, fine actor and he has written some books, himself, so this gave me an inkling that Sinister might be different.  I liked this a lot.  Good acting and a good story.  I could sense the ending by the first half of the film, but that isn't why I watch and like horror movies.  It's like any other genre...the journey from beginning to end.  And, the journey was interesting; I was not bored for a second and there are a couple of unique spins in the story that I have not seen in other films of this type.",1385251200,4,1010,4.081218274111675

5443476,5,B00AJLHUYO,"We are constantly bombarded by the media with true stories of murder and torture, and twisted minds of people who do terrible things to other people.  That's in part what makes this movie so foreboding and dark.  Okay, so the truth behind the murders in this movie is a bit farfetched, but it's a MOVIE.  So was Frankenstein, the Wolfman, etc. but that didn't keep people from being creeped out by the sheer thought of the possibility of something like that happening.  Any situation where innocence is turned into something sinister (no pun intended) is always disturbing, and that's what makes this movie engaging.  I think it was well done and qualifies as a good, solid ""scary movie"" if that's what you're looking for.  It's amusing when reviewers tell everyone how mediocre a movie is because the ending was predictable.  Well, if you sit there and think about it as though you were Sherlock Holmes instead of letting yourself be entertained, you can figure out any number of endings to any movie.  There's no challenge in that, so nobody is really impressed by their self-proclaimed acumen.  Apparently some people don't know how to sit back and let themselves be entertained through that wonderful little mind trick called suspension of disbelief.  That being the case, they should become movie critics and get paid for what they do rather than doing it for free and trying to turn other people off to something that is potentially enjoyable.",1385251200,,1449,4.877551020408164

Cons- Didn't show enough or explain enough about the supernatural entity, there's completely no dialogue in a lot of the scenes- just silence",1384992000,,415,4.802816901408451

I normally repel and a have no good words for horror movies that put children in them as subjects of evil or being obsessed by evil spirits. This was well done all around spooky and got me jumping. The way the camera excluded the subject but made the viewer the accomplice in seeing these dead or demon children, disturbed and caught the viewer off guard. the directing was super and acting was top notch between the family. other actors seemed too rigid or unbelievable (Police, deputy). I liked it. now I must try to get some sleep...another good reason to watch.",1383955200,2,626,4.598214285714286
5443486,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I really enjoyed this film. It made me jump more than a few times and even squeezed a scream out of me. Parts of the plot felt like retread, but there were enough new spins to keep things interesting.  Ethan Hawker did a solid job as a writer so desperate for one more best-seller he moves his family into a home where the previous family died under mysterious circumstances and one child goes missing.  Before long his own family is affected: sons sleep walking worsens, daughter is communicating with a child no one can see, and his wife is increasingly anxious to leave.
The spin on the actual killer is different and fresh, and I really enjoyed how the movie ended.
Added bonus Vincent D'Onofrio is in the movie! I deducted one point because I wanted more screen time from him.  He was the professor/demonologist and two brief Skype sessions did not allow enough explanation of the origin of Bughuul.  Often these explanations and backstory are one of my favorite parts of scary movies, so I felt it was given short shrift.  That said, I found the movie genuinely scary",1383955200,,1073,4.626315789473685
5443487,5,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie truly lives up to it's title. Ethan is excellent in showing his fear and as the viewer your right there with him.
Only one thing I'd change is that too much of the movie is in the dark, literally. First I thought it was my DVD portable player. Then I watched it on my new 32inch Sony flat screen with a Sony DVD player attached and too many scenes
were too dark, and not all of them were meant to be at night.
To sum up, the scary in this is that the monster can't be caught or even believed by most, which makes it's scariness
all that much and more. I mean it could be believed if you're superstitious. I could believe it. We need many more horrors of this degree.  Absolute BRAVO.",1383868800,,694,4.102941176470588

5443509,3,B00AJLHUYO,"A crime novelist, Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) moves into a house where several members of a family were brutally murdered and the youngest daughter disappeared. Ellison, trying to revive his now dead writing career, intends to write a book about the murders and has moved into the house for inspiration. His clueless wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his 2 children, are unaware of their new homes murderous past. Ellison soon discovers a bunch of home movies in his attic, and when he views them, finds out they are all snuff films, spanning several decades. He enlists the help of a local deputy, and a professor who specializes in the occult, to try to make sense of the grisly crimes and to establish the connections between the murders despite years, decades, separating each crimes.

This creepy horror tale is at times shocking and disturbing despite having minimal gore on display. It's all in the atmosphere and the gruesome subject matter. Watching people being murdered in horrific ways via a grainy home movie is chilling and the super 8 movies are very well done. The locations are dark, with minimal lighting, no sounds, sometimes grainy and always spooky. Some of the home movies start out charmingly enough, with the luck-less victims having a great time either fishing, at a picnic, hanging around in the swimming pool etc then the footage cuts to some horrible executions. The tale then takes a supernatural twist when Ellison discovers a creepy looking face watching from the depths of a swimming pool in one of the film clips and also notices a strange occult symbol that keeps re-appearing and is discovered to represent a malevolent and mysterious pagan deity.

The film is very atmospheric, and many of the shots are in complete darkness and the main character is always walking around looking fearful and paranoid, which adds to the films tone. However, I do wish he would have just turned on some lights and saved us all the grief. Dude, you are investigating a strange noise and carrying a baseball bat for protection, walking through various dark rooms of your creepy house, would it hurt you to turn on a few light switches? Geesh. Despite a very creepy atmosphere, the film does not always get it right and there are one too many jump scares too many. There is one scene that takes it to an absurd level and inspired some laughter from the audience when I watched this at the theatre. I imagine laughter was not what the director was going for and this just proves that you can over-do it. The film is a bit predictable and how many supernatural themed horror films have you seen that involve a child who can sense the evil and draws pictures of the evil yet the parents remain clueless? The pace is also a bit slow. This movie is more psychological so this is expected, but having one actor carry the whole picture may not have been a good idea. Hawke is good, but we get far too many shots of him being shocked, or worried, or bored, or scared, and although I liked the idea of keeping the villain a mystery and not giving it a whole lot of screen time, I would have preferred more of it, and less of the annoying children that kept re-appearing throughout the film.

Despite the negatives, ""Sinister"" is a pretty good chiller with good performances, and a lot of tension and atmosphere and although there are a lot of murders being committed, most of it is not shown, just implied or not clear enough to warrant looking away (even so, I have to admit, some of the home movies, as brief as they were, disturbed me to the core). As is typical of today's horror movies, there is a twist ending and the film ends on a high yet disturbing note. With some minor tweaks, ""Sinister"" could have been a whole lot better but it is still a good horror film to watch with the lights off and on Halloween night.

This is the first movie I almost quit watching because it was so scary. Glad I finished BUT BRAVO! I love originality!!,1382486400,,271,4.44
5443511,5,B00AJLHUYO,"If you've seen the movie, then you should be able to complete that line.  If not, you are in for a seriously chilling moment that I won't go into great detail about here.

Are you creeped out by creepy, murdering kids every time, no matter how often it's been done in movies?  Yeah, me too.  This one has that in spades.

Ethan Hawke does fine work as a ""true crime"" author a few years away from his last successful book.  He moves himself, his wife, son and daughter into a home that happens to be the site of a gruesome murder that also left one child missing (there seems to be a pattern of families being murdered with one child then turning up missing).  Another reason for the move, it should be noted, is the downturn in the family's economic fortunes; they simply cannot afford to live where they had been living or sustain their previous lifestyle.

There are echoes of ""The Shining"" as Hawke's character discovers some old Super-8 films in the attic, along with, how convenient, a projector and decides to play them for himself.  What he sees are a series of gruesome murders.  Rather than share them with authorities, he decides to do his own investigation.

Things get more and more freaky and end badly.  VERY badly.  That's all I have to say about that.

This is a don't miss, especially during the Halloween season.  Enjoy.

Cheers.",1382486400,,1347,4.55

5443513,2,B00AJLHUYO,"You know the catch phrase, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover?"" It's the vice versa for me. I've never seen or heard of this movie before, and just by the cover, it looks very scary and it could be an interesting movie to watch.

Unfortunately, it was a waste of time.

The only reason why it is considered a horror movie is because of the blood and gore. It has very sick and twisted murders shown in it, it's more disgusting rather than scary.

*SPOILER*

What bothers me the most and why I rate this film so low, is that major parts of the story makes no sense. The movie doesn't show any connections between the characters. There is no connection or story to what makes the house they lived in be chained to all the past murders. I was almost completely lost by the end of the movie.

I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again. A waste of time, and I was just... lost!",1382054400,,878,4.171597633136095

It is hard to even talk about the movie without giving too much away and I hate to sound clich, but this was definitely one of the scariest movies I have seen as of late. It does not fit the ""Teen Scream"" horror genre at all and has a solid plot that keeps you guessing.

Without giving too much away, it has a great premise, both psychological and jump-out-at-you thrills, and the acting was good too.  Some might find the pacing slow, but I found that it nicely built the suspense to the climax.  On the downside I found the scenes a little dark, in the lighting sense.  Even shots in the daylight felt like they were lit with a 20 watt bulb.  I know it's hard to have something jump out of the shadows if there are no shadows but I felt like turning the brightness on the TV up on several occasions just to get out of the perpetual twilight.  The fact that the characters seemed incapable of operating a light switch, even when searching their house at night, seemed excessive.  Avid horror movie watchers will also probably peg the ending, or at least narrow it down to a couple of possibilities before the climax.  Still, it's definitely worth a watch.

5443567,2,B00AJLHUYO,"Quick synopsis of the film (No Spoilers): A writer moves his family to a new town to get closer to the source of a story he is writing.  Most of the true horror revolves around a set of old 8 millimeter film rolls he finds in his attic.  Upon further investigation, he realizes that he has bit off more than he can chew and things get all kinds of wacky.

Sometimes I like to watch a movie without knowing anything about it beforehand.  I had no idea who made Sinister, or who acted in it. All I had heard was that it was a good movie, so I went for it.  I had no hopes, no expectations, no idea of what I was getting into, I just wanted to watch a movie. I'm not exactly a film snob, but I don't like stupid movies and it takes a lot to actually scare me.  With that said, the first twenty or thirty minutes of this film were truly, truly scary.  My girlfriend was huddled up against me and we both jumped out of our skins a few times and I got frightened enough that I had to get up and make sure all our doors were locked.  The idea of a home invader is a terrifying thought that most people can relate to.  I think we can all agree that the idea of someone filming us from the bushes and then drowning us in our own swimming pool is pretty scary.

  The main character(Ethan Hawke) goes through the film rolls (much like ""8 MM"", starring Nicolas Cage) watching them, taking notes and trying to keep his lunch down.  Each film has it's own unique, haunting soundtrack which I thought was a really brilliant touch.  But once he has watched all the films, the movie itself is over.  At least for me, it was.  From there, it develops into a hodgepodge of messy cliches and childish nonsense.  It was amazing how suddenly the movie went from truly terrifying, to laughable.

**** SPOILERS AND BIASED OPINIONS, AHOY! ****

This movie could have been so good.  So Effing Good.  The police officer that becomes friends with the writer and funnels him information about the murders could have been the murderer the whole time and that would have been good!  He was strange enough that you were wondering what he was up to, but likable enough that you didn't worry about it. Bam! Perfect set-up for a psychotic killer! But his character went nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. Instead, it turns out the real murderers were the children that were missing from each case.  Wow, what a surprise, what a twist, etc..  And of course, it would have been too much for our fragile, weak minds to handle if it was just the children killing by their own accord, so we have to bring in a demon that has possessed the children to do his evil bidding. Everything about the ghost-children was junk, from the way they ""creepily"" turned their heads in unison, to how they held up their fingers to their lips making the ""hush"" motion at the end of the bonus footage(how convenient that was, by the way!), to their horrible makeup. I don't know where this obsession with children as monsters came from but it needs to end.  It's not scary and hasn't been since the 1970's or 80's.  Stop it.

As for the demon, he wasn't even a character.  He had no lines and no apparent motive.  Someone just decided to put a member of Slipknot in the movie to get a few cheap jump-scares.  By the way, I had NO IDEA that his face was going to pop up in the final shot before the credits, I was surprised because I didn't see that coming a mile away, at all, etc.

""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"" are examples of good horror movies because the horror is real and there's no paranormal cop-outs. Paranormal movies were good, once upon a time, but not in this day an age. Sinister could have been good(and it was really good for twenty-some minutes), but it quickly turned into garbage. Movies like this are the reason I don't buy movies anymore, and instead, turn to pirated formats.

Ethan Hawke plays an author who unearths a collection of snuff films by a serial killer and what follows is both chilling and disturbing and perhaps the biggest surprise was the ending.

An ending that I didn't see coming.

Sinister is a disturbing and strange film.

I didn't like it.",1375920000,,439,4.518987341772152
5443578,3,B00AJLHUYO,"I actually regret that I didn't finish it. It was a slow burn, hobbled by the fact that it felt like we'd seen the premise play out before, and that the characters continually insisted on doing exactly the opposite of what they needed to do to protect themselves. But I went to bed that night feeling super creeped out (which is a good thing!) and I later read the plot summary on Wikipedia (no spoilers!) and I wish I'd finished it. I think it would have scared the bejeezus out of me.

While Ethan Hawke is a great actor and did a great job, that's about all that made the film worth it.  I feel like the folks that made this film just had pieces to the how to make a scary movie equation and that's all they used.  You're walking around in the dark for about 90% of the film, you've got your scary music, your jump-scares (which are cheap shots if you ask me) and your creepy children.  I feel cheated.  My girlfriend was playing a video game nearby and I'm pretty sure I was more interested in her game than this movie.

Another 21st century horror that won't disappoint! I only gave it 4 stars because there are some spots where it does drag a little. But they're minimal.,1375574400,,467,4.379310344827586

I went into the movie blindly having no idea what it was about and it was fun and surprising and extremely creepy. If you liked Insidious, the Conjuring, etc. you'll probably enjoy this.

5443590,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. horror is my favorite genre, and like all horror fans know, you have to wade through quite a lot of movies that are so-so, downright awful, or ""good enough"" to find the few gems -- and honestly, those are usually ones i stumble across on netflix (like ""The Ceremony"", which was wonderfully scary).

this movie scared the $$#* out of me, no lie. there are some scenes that, if i think about them late at night, make it hard to get to sleep! the story is well-written and holds up through all three acts, and the way the movie is shot is just beautiful. but what really, really made this movie for me was the sound design. i think it's possibly the most incredible sound design i've ever heard in a horror movie. and the way it builds dread is almost exquisite, with enough frightening flashes and creepy cinematography to keep a constant build up of tension for the whole thing.

i love this film, and it's right up there with ""The Haunting"" (the old version, not the travesty that was the remake), and ""The Changeling"" for me (that coal cart seance scene ahhhh). This movie plays with the concept of horror extremely well, blending supernatural horror, psychological humor, and just plain old dread together in a masterful way. and i can't say enough about the sound design -- which makes such a huge impact (to me, anyway) on a movie, especially horror. imagine if ""The Last House on the Left"" hadn't had such a terrible musical score, and how much more frightening it might have been!

i highly recommend this movie, for the plot, the overall atmosphere, and a story that is layered and complex without being convoluted or unbelievable (there are totally believable supernatural horror movies! those are the ones that really get you -- when you're drawn in enough to be convinced this is possible, and keep thinking about it long after the movie is over.) I didn't even realize the actor was Ethan Hawke until I looked the film up on IMDB after i saw it. great film, i'd love to see hollywood put out more movies like this! even if i might never sleep again ;)",1375228800,,2128,4.507772020725389

This movie has some creepy moments where something makes you jump, which is great but mostly this movie consists of watching people getting murdered on old film.  Murder-porn.  The suspenseful aspect of this wears thin after the 1st or 2nd scene like this. After this point it's obvious you're about to witness another grisly murder. The orchestrating villain eventually surfaces however you get no background info. about who he is or where he came from or his motivations.

The premise starts out fairly compelling, and I won't say that there aren't a few interesting visuals, etc. I like the repetition of imagery with the super 8 film, and as much as I feel this kind of thing is an over-used visual trope I didn't mind it. The problem with this movie is that the plot makes almost no sense, and it unravels completely by the ending which was just over-the-top predictable and stupid. I really wanted to like this, but I recommend not wasting your time! Particularly with horror their has got to be some kind of realistic thread that pulls it together since there is usually so much fantastical stuff happening with anything supernatural, but this one just fails to deliver any kind of satisfying reasoning behind the events that occur.",1373587200,,940,4.568047337278107

Does a good job at getting under your skin and the storyline was pretty interestingly thought out. I liked that there wasn't a huge amount of gore, yes there was blood and all but it wasn't how much blood and body parts can we throw across the screen at once. It was more in the style of older thrillers where they lead up to what is going to happen but don't actually show it, but through a reflection. Stuff like that.

Like I said, I have seen a lot of movies and they generally freak me out for the duration of the picture---but this one will stay with me.  Holy.  And, you have to watch on the computer or someplace where you can easily replay spots because there is so much in many of shots--it's easy to miss.  I don't usually write reviews---but I felt compelled to say that this movie is unequivocally one of the scariest films I have ever seen.  I am still scared---and I don't scare easily.  Geez!  Seriously--I am afraid to go to bed.  And the psychological aspect---that the images are gateways and of course the viewer is entering that gateway....Frightening.

He watches the super 8 snuff films of five family being murdered and decides that he can figure this out on his own. He doesn't the deputy does, and its already too late.

He discovers films of murdered victims who died in the same house plus more footage of related earlier crimes that were taken by the assailant.  Hawk hordes this information hoping to profit from it through his writings, but only succeeds in endangering himself and his family.  He has unleashed an ancient demon who toys with him, yet he stubbornly wants to face it alone and somehow benefit.  He was probably doomed the minute he played the films the first time, but his own sense of entitlement and selfishness with the information help seal his fate.  This film is a solid horror picture in the genre of ""The Ring"" but even more foreboding as there appears to be no way to fight the terrifying evil demon.

While the man has his head turned, the image of the boogie man turns to stare at him... and it was ridiculous. It is not that incredible for images to move on a computer screen, at least to those of us under the age of 70. And I love how the son's night terrors are completely overlooked and that the girls creepy drawing, which she drew all over the house, are apparently invisible to the parents. ""Oh no honey, this house is perfectly safe"" he says as his daughter draws creepy dead people hanging from trees in the background. ""Quit farting around, honey!""
But the number one reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the TEN scenes where the father is walking around his house in the dark and running into things.

This movie is so creepy and eerie.  The musical score lends ominous foreboding throughout.  Character development is good.  D'Onofrio's character was a nice treat, with his Pink Floyd t-shirt and weird knowledge of the occult.  Deputy So-and-So was great comic relief, as this movie is extremely intense.  Hawk's character's drive to reclaim his former fame puts his family in deadly danger.  Extremely disturbing.  Not much gore for a movie so horrifically frightening.

5443642,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Let's look at a brief history of what the horror films have brought us through the decades, shall we? After the Universal Monsters had all their eerie night in the dark, British sensibilities brought us the Gothic ghost horrors of the fifties and early sixties. Then the late sixties and seventies brought us a slate of movies involving secret satanic rituals and demonic possessions (which reflected real national fears of such societies according to polls at the time). The late seventies and eighties gave birth to the unstoppable killing machine of the slasher flicks and their near infinite variations. The nineties were a period of nostalgic retreads with the only lasting sub genre being the ""found footage"" films that splashed into widespread success with the hit The Blair Witch Project. Currently, Hollywood makes any variation or combination of the above sub genres- possession and found footage films clearly the most popular. Sinister says, ""why not combine all of those genre's into one film."" And it does it well. The film lives off the strength of Ethan Hawke's character, true crime fiction writer Ellison. It contains a powerful and compelling narrative that unfolds with the proper taunt amount of pacing, stronger than most horror films. It has some disturbingly real and grisly visuals unrestrained by its PG-13 rating thanks entirely to clever film making. While no horror movie ever really scares me, those images stuck with me which is a testament to its quality. The ending was telegraphed and the reveal of a certain supernatural element in the climax of the second act seemed technically lacking, but other than that the film is strong. Frankly, its probably one of my top ten horror films of the last decade... at least this week. All those lists are constantly fluctuating.",1371168000,7,1802,5.070707070707071
5443643,5,B00AJLHUYO,I really enjoyed this movie it started out a mobile slow but didn't' t let me down. The producers were really thinking on this one!,1371081600,,131,4.28
5443644,2,B00AJLHUYO,"Now that I've seen this movie, I am very surprised that the majority of ratings were four stars and above. Based on this high rating, I rented it from Netflix and was very, very disappointed. Warning: there are some spoilers below.

The cast seemed impressive. I generally like Ethan Hawke, Fred Thompson, and (especially) Vincent D'Onofrio (who was uncredited....probably by choice), but this production gave them little to work with. Ethan Hawke spent virtually the entire movie roaming the house, in the dark despite nearby light switches, being startled every 10 seconds by things we've all seen before....items appearing from nowhere, weird faces in photos, scorpions, snakes, falling through the floor, etc. What was particularly annoying is that the director was not content with simply letting the shock value of each revelation speak for itself, but chose to accompany each of them with a blast of noise so loud that it made you jump off the couch. Fred Thompson did the best he could with his ""cranky sheriff"" part, but Vincent D'Onofrio never directly appeared in person, relegated instead to a talking image on a computer screen, providing all the plot exposition necessary to make some sense of what was happening.

The prevailing feeling throughout the movie was that I had seem it all before, and done much better. The idea of an ancient demon making life miserable for innocent folks was done long ago....in Ghost Busters, for one. The progressive deterioration of a father being driven crazy by events in a house....in the Shining and Amityville Horror. The threat to children by paranormal forces....in Poltergeist and about 98 other movies. In short, there was not a single original moment in the entire film. If you have been watching movies for even a few years, you have already seen it all before....and probably done much better. Add to that the fact that this movie lasted for almost two hours, occurred almost entirely in the dark (turn on the lights !!!), and dragged so horribly, that inadvertent naps were not only inevitable, but almost a relief.

A horror movie is only as scary as its villain, and in this case, the ancient demon, I forget his name, was a joke. He reminded me of just how awful Exorcist II was (remember good old Pazuzu?). Indeed, I have seen more convincing demons at my door on Halloween; and, let's face it, the whole ""ancient demon"" concept has been done to death. The moment Vincent told us who was responsible for the mayhem, I rolled my eyes and almost reached for the STOP button on the remote. You KNOW a movie you have selected is lousy when members of your family progressively lose interest, wander off to do other things, and you end up all alone, marinating in the misery of your own poor judgement.

Avoid this embarrassment and leave this turkey on the shelf or otherwise un-rented, un-purchased, and most importantly, un-watched. After all, if you've watched almost any other horror movies before, you've already seen it.",1370995200,,2987,4.908910891089109

5443649,2,B00AJLHUYO,"The plot of this movie is good and original. Unfortunately, the filmmakers ruined it with cheap photography tricks and having characters behave in ways that defied logic.

The cheap photography trick was the lighting. I get that they were going for dark and foreboding. Unfortunately, they rushed past that at the speed of light and ran right into something that played like a guide book on how to not film a horror movie. Almost all of the scenes were so dark that when there actually was light, it was surprising. Like I said, I get that they were going for dark and foreboding. But this runs right into the other issue: behavior that defies logic.

Now, let's say you think someone is in your house. You're creeped out and hearing noises. What are you going to do? Walk around a dark house or walk around flipping every light on as you go? The filmmakers went for the former every single time. It was very distracting from what was otherwise a great plot. Another example of behavior that defies logic: You're asleep and someone shines a flashlight in your face. This would wake normal people.

It is creepy in an unique way, instead of going for the loud-noise-sudden-appearance technique of all horror movies nowadays. It plays with your mind, kind of like The Exorcist did.

5443662,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister tries to do for cardboard boxes what Psycho did for showers. This movie definitely unnerves. The cast is fantastic to a fault; Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance in particular act the hell out of a scene together later in the film as tensions are coming to a head. The movie is about a true crime writer (Hawke) who moves his family into a murder house so that he can get a better feel for the subjects of his latest book. At the house - which his family is not supposed to know is the actual murder house, which is one of a number of unlikely things he does in this movie - he finds a box of home movies. When he watches the home movies he realizes the mystery he is investigating is a lot weirder than he ever imagined. The idea behind what happened to the previous family is plenty disturbing enough to keep the viewer uncomfortable, and the research the lead character uncovers about a symbol discovered at the crime scene will keep you thinking about the film long after you shut out the lights to try to sleep. The soundtrack is a genius blend of sound effects and eery music, not quite one or the other, to keep you on edge. It's just that Ellison, the lead character, does things you'd think any halfway intelligent human being would have known better than to do. Like move his family into a murder house and think they wouldn't find out about it. Or something else he does later in the movie, which (minor spoilers) was telegraphed in such a way that the viewer did not need the deputy's timely intervention to see it coming. As a true crime writer, Ellison should have picked up on that connection and it would appear he didn't. These random acts of derp from the main character detract a bit from the overall enjoyment of the movie, but it's still well worth a watch if you like creepy films.",1369699200,,1808,4.383928571428571

Ethan Hawke really helps bring the story to the viewer. It is well made. My only complaint was too much darkness, but the darkness is critical to the psychological horror of the tale. So, endure it. You will be glad you did.

5443680,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Let me preface this review by saying that the movie started out great. It was gritty, disturbing, and drew me right in. The death scenes were downright sickening to watch, along with a hint of ingenuity throughout. At one point, I even told my wife that I wanted to stop watching since I was so afraid.
I quickly lost this about 60% of the way in as the movie began to (spoiler alert) signify a more undead or haunted aspect. Also, who hears a noise in their house in the middle of the night, and does not turn on all the lights to see what is going on? Spooky: yes. Realistic: not necessarily. Especially with children in the house.
The movie had great potential from the beginning. The premise was fairly original- a crime author who moves into the homes of victims to get the best feel for his new novels. The scares started shortly after with surprising scenes and loud noises that made me jump just about every time. It started to lose me over halfway through, and the ending I didn't particularly care for. Having said this, I did not suspect the actual killer was who it ended up being. Kind of a tricky, possession twist.
Do I recommend this movie: Sure. Try it out for a well placed thrill, some well written scenes, cheap scares, and decent acting. Do not get your expectations up for the end. I felt it built right up simply to fall kind of flat. Not disappointing; just too exemplified for what it was.",1369180800,,1414,4.421455938697318

5443682,3,B00AJLHUYO,"This is a movie that I wanted to like more than I did. I met the screenwriter at conventions and he seems pretty cool. The opening 10 minutes that set up the movie were an intriguing combination of decent acting and subtle exposition. Ethan Hawke plays a true crime writer who moves into a house that is a crime scene in order to write that one book that will make him famous. As he starts investigating the crime, he sees a lot of home movies that are all very disturbing. His research becomes even more insane as similar murders crop up other places.

It's a great setup but there's a certain point where the movie becomes all about the research. There's only so much tension that you can get out of a man searching over the internet and that's pretty much exhausted in the first 20 minutes. The middle part of the movie is full of just too much research and while this might have been more scary in a movie theater (people are freaking out over Paranormal Activity after all), it really doesn't work very well at home.

There's also the domestic argument scene that adds some veracity to the movie but is also a drag on the last act. The ending has some nice creepy camera work but it is conveying a twist that everyone could see coming a mile away.

Still, it's a fine horror movie with many of the tropes that people have come to expect from their midnight viewing. There's nothing special about it. At points, it drags on with too many ""spooky images"" and ""guy searching for clues on the internet"" scenes but it's not a total waste of time.",1369094400,,1546,4.398601398601398

Supernatural/ghost/demon stories seem to always strike a chord with me for some reason. That whole things are there but you can't see them/things go bump in the night thing just gets me. I have always loved things like ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""A Haunting"" for just that reason. So when these types of movies come out I am always looking forward to seeing them. The best thing about these movies is when they do it right and have the right amount of atmosphere and chills. This kids is one of those movies as I ended up loving it, in fact it actually gave me chills at certain points.

Ellison Oswalt [Ethan Hawk] is a true crime writer that had a huge hit and then could never match the same level of success with each project following. But maybe just maybe this new project of his may turn things around. He and his family are moving into a house that at one time was the scene of a horrific multi murder. While there he is going to do his usual thing and investigate the crime and try to get back that fame he once had.

As it turns out he is not that welcome in town by its people or its law officials, but that is not the worst of things. Once settled in a little he discovers a box in the attic, the contents are a few films. So naturally he sets them up and watches them, turns out they are home movies of the murder he is investigating. The crazy thing is that there are more home movies of murders from different states and time periods in the box, and they may all be connected, and they may have brought the same evil into his home.

This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while, especially from here in America. I have really been enjoying foreign horror films more so the past couple of years but this one is very very good. Written by first timer C. Robert Cargill and director Scott Derrickson this movie has everything you could want from a horror flick. The best thing though in my opinion is the atmosphere of this dark movie. I also like that movie builds and doesn't rush anything. A lot of good movies have been ruined by that. Also the super 8 films that he watches are very creepy and seem very real

Acting wise I have to say that Ethan Hawk did a great job here, maybe my favorite performance from him. he plays a man who longs for something lost that slowly succumbs to something truly dark and evil. Juliet Rylance who plays his wife is also excellent here as are the children. All around I liked everyone here including all the supporting players, which is rare because there is usually someone who annoys me.

This film comes with some cool features including things on true crime writing but it is the audio commentaries that are the key to me. Firstly we have the director's commentary with Derrickson, and this is full of great insight into the making of the film. I would highly recommend viewing this movie with that commentary first as I think it was recorded first. Then of course we have the excellent and just as great writer's commentary with both Derrickson and Cargill. This commentary as all kinds of interesting facts and stuff that only adds to the film. I would highly recommend this film to any horror fan out there.",1368489600,2,3188,4.367622259696459

5443696,5,B00AJLHUYO,"The acting was very believable. The story line and ending is about as twisted as one can get.  Although Scott Derrickson hasn't achieved the notariety expected from a film of this quality, he will.  This movie was produced on a $3 million budget and quietly brought in over $87 million.  His blockbuster, The Day The Earth Stood Still, brought in over $233 million.  So Scott knows how to be a screenwriter and did so very well with Sinister.",1368489600,,442,4.628205128205129

5443707,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I watched ""Sinister"" with no real expectations. After all, most horror movies follow the same patterns and are barely worth watching. This one seemed headed in that direction until Ethan Hawke's character finds those old footage reels of snuff films. Those alone make this movie creepy. The soundtrack played as the reels roll and Hawke's character watches families be murdered in horrible ways is so strange and eerie. I had no clue where this movie was going, but I knew I was creeped out every time one of those snuff films was played.

The sense of impending doom is heavy, the acting is top notch, the crumbling family structure is believable, and everything is so mysterious that you realize that mystery and not knowing just what the hell is really going on is more frightening than true horror and gore.

When things come to light at the end of the films you do get the sense of things clicking into place, although admittedly if you spend too much time thinking about it all you'll wonder how and why certain things happened. For instance, why an evil force/serial killer would need a bunch of snuff films to strike again. It really is massively convoluted by the end, and yet, that makes it all the creepier. The mystery never truly ends. All you know is that no one is safe, and you had better hope you never find a box full of snuff films in your attic. If you do, don't watch them!",1367971200,2,1394,4.549800796812749

The opening scene is definitely chilling and it grabs your attention right off the bat, making you want to find out what the story is about. But it's pretty bad when I realized 3/4 into the movie that I didn't jump once during any of the scenes that had been set up to make me do so. Also there were times that the picture was so dark it was ridiculous. I get that you want to relay realism, but to the point of not being able to even see? Give me a break.

And mature movie goers who have seen the same old flash of black & white sudden appearance of some ghost out of nowhere right next to the main character with the same old requisite blast of loud music: Guess what? It's really old. There are some really interesting ideas out there (e.g., The Pact) that relate stories in innovative ways without all the black and white ghosts and sudden bursts of music. Really, I think it's time to move on.

There was nothing that explained why the antagonist decided to do what he did when he did. The last half hour came together a bit too conveniently - the set up for a sequel is abundantly clear. But really, I'd love to know why no one else in the family seemed to have an ounce of logic or seemed to be able to hear anything out of the ordinary in the house.",1366675200,,1335,4.1505791505791505

Even with a formulaic plot, Sinister grabs the viewer for a fairly fast pasted ride.  There are a few plot holes; however, they could be explained using the realm of the supernatural.  The evil could have been better explained by utilizing the Professor Jonas character more.

Negatives aside, the movie subsists with a remarkably small cast and small area.  The plot moves forward at a well paced clip with certain surprising moments.  The actors all properly portray their characters.  Also importantly, the story does not break its own rules.

I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under 14 or maybe even 16 even though there is NO nudity and only a little language --- The disturbing imagery and terror could keep you up at night!

I've really seen them ALL when it comes to Horror movies and there was only one movie that I truly felt ""disturbed"" while watching it and after it was over - THE EXORCIST.  But, believe it or not, I believe I can now place this one next to it!

Yes, like another reviewer, I was annoyed that Ethan Hawke would NEVER turn the lights on like a normal person would, but the story, disturbing imagery, sound effects and great acting MORE than made up for that problem.

Repeated views will tell if this one can stand up to the classic EXORCIST.  But, for now, all I can do is highly recommend this movie to any real Horror/Suspense fan!",1365465600,,1118,4.320574162679426

I always have to give a little when it comes to rating horror flicks.  You know that it is really hard to be over the top scary and not just dumb.  While not everyone feels that way, let me give you an idea of where I am coming from......
I loved John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Halloween"" - both 5 stars.  Even the original ""Texas Chainsaw..."" holds a place dear in my heart for scare factor and just plane creepy - 4.75 stars.  The first ""The Descent"" was awesome - 5 stars.  I also enjoyed ""The Strangers"" - 4 stars.  Not as much as ""Vacancy"", though - 4.5 stars.  Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" wasn't half bad either - 4.5 stars.  ""Paranormal Activity 4"" was the best of that series, thus far - 4.5 stars.  ""The Ring"", super scary - 4.5 stars.

Sinister may well be forgotten in less than a week, but it did serve up some good scares - 3.5 stars.

5443794,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Pretty different from other movies that are similar. Sinister is a very original concept and it is an excellent movie. The twist at the end isn't mind-blowing, but quite disturbing.

5443795,5,B00AJLHUYO,"First off let me say that I freaking love old school horror flicks and psychological thrillers.  I cut my teeth on the original Friday the 13th, Halloween, Prom Night, Terror Train and Fright Night.  The mark of a good scary movie, for me, is the scare-the-crap-out-of-me story line and not a gore fest where you can see the victim's entrails.  With that in mind, this movie is by far the scariest movie I have seen in years.  Damn!  I finished watching this movie an hour ago and I still don't think my heart rate has gone down to normal levels yet.  Without giving away too many spoilers I will detail the awesomeness:

-Move into a house where a murder (or murders as the case may be) happened
-Find a box of creepy old super 8 movies
-Watch said movies over and over again in a dark room while drinking copious amounts of liquor
-Ignore your kids creepy and disturbing new actions
-Add the supernatural factor in
-Add a compelling mystery that spans 40 years and you are the first one to make the connection
-Include lots of visual scares that cause your viewers (well me at least) to let our blood curdling screams that make your husband afraid the neighbors will call the cops because it sounds like you are being murdered
-Good surprise ending that I didn't see coming until the very end
-Sleep with your lights on for at least a week
-Consider therapy for your horror movie obsession...

Now for the cons:

-Why does no one turn the damn lights on while they are searching/wandering around the house?  Sometimes it was so dark I couldn't see anything on the screen. Maybe that was the director's point but it was annoying.
-The wife bugged me.  Who just lets their husband make all the decisions these days and blindly does whatever he wants?
-I just know I am going to have nightmares for weeks because of this movie.",1365033600,,1826,4.519756838905775

5443797,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Ethan Hawke potrays Ellison Oswalt a Novelist who decides to move his family to a new Home. I will stop there because i don't want to spoil the film, but I will say this: Sometimes Moving IS NOT the best idea. Sinister not only has a strong supporting cast, but a story line that is very convincing, and actually quite frightening. I was shocked and still scared even after I had finished watching Sinister. You may disagree with me completely and that is perfectly alright. Sinister is a HORROR movie. I will confess that I was not immediately able to go to sleep after watching this movie; even stranger, it was stuck in my head for a few days.

5443798,1,B00AJLHUYO,"Well, another haunted house thriller went down the tubes.
The previews are always the best thing. I loved it when Ethan Hawke saw a cardboard box and suddenly it opens and out slithers a little child. Wow!
But after sitting back to watch ""Sinister"" I gradually sensed this was going to be a total bomb.
For one thing, the movie is filmed so darkly I had to keep stopping it to replay a scene that I couldn't make out. After awhile, I just ignored it because I saw that our hero, Ethan Hawke, has this habit of roaming around this house haunted house with the weakest flashlight devised by Thomas Alva Edison.
The rooms were equipped with light switches but our hero appeared to have an aversion to overhead light. Perhaps the movie company couldn't afford overhead lightning.
Then we see the ghosts of the murdered kids.
They all wear Mummy make-up and clench their teeth and glower. What is their purpose? I've seen scarier ghosts on the Sy-Fy Channel.
While Ethan roams the house, he keeps leaping into the air from horror as something crashes around him. This poor guy needed a watch dog to keep him company.
And then there's supposed to be the big scare scene where all five dead kids form a group in the hallway but they always jump into another room when Ethan looks back.
We have of course the whiny, befuddled wife and the big question that perhaps others have been screaming; Why do you refuse to leave this haunted house?
When I think of all the ""haunted house"" movies where the actors never think of moving out of, the biggest one is the house in ""Poltergeist,"" ""The Amityville Horror"" and then ""The Haunting of HIll House"" and ""The Haunting"" and...and...
but if movie characters in bad movies  started acting like they had common sense, we wouldn't have bombs like ""Sinister.""",1365033600,2,1788,4.622641509433962

All I know is that SINISTER left me with some honest goosebumps as I walked through my darkened house after viewing it, afraid to look behind me.

Very good acting and filming: Ethan Hawke and crew all give commendable performances here, and Fred Dalton Thompson plays a small but memorable role as ""the Sheriff.""

5443817,3,B00AJLHUYO,"When I start figuring things out before Ethan Hawke's investigative journalist character does, it's not such a good sign.  However, the plot was pretty cool and the atmosphere and acting were all fine.  I think the problem was that I really did find that the plot had some predictably familiar elements (spooky ghost children, current events linked to a tragic past, a lead character who becomes obsessed and gets in over his head, an expert of the occult that the main character turns to for help, etc.)  If these elements all came together and, in its final act, did a 1-80 and pulled the rug out from under me, I would have been forgiving of these elements.  However, it pretty much just plays out the way I thought it would.  I know I'm not getting into specifics because I don't want to spoil anything, and it sounds like I didn't like the movie.  I definitely thought it was passable entertainment that was competently made.  But if you watch this kind of film on a regular basis, like I do, you'll find yourself awash in genre cliches (some hidden better than others).

5443827,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I have been a fan of ghost/hanted house horror movies for 50 years and Sinister is one of the scariest and most disturbing films I have ever seen.  From the reviews, you know that the protagonist finds several 8 mm films in the attic of the murder house in which he has just moved his family.  The titles on the film cannisters alone give you a shudder because you KNOW what will be on the movie: ""Hanging Aound"" (the opening credits have already shown the hanging of 4 people), ""Pool Party"" and (worst) ""Barbeque"".  The night scenes are brilliantly shot with just enough light to make you feel you are in the house with Elliot.  As the movie progresses, the clues pile up but you will never guess the ending.  The musical score is moody and sets the tone for the whole movie. I couldn't get it out of my head and I still see some of the scariest scenes in my mind's eye.

Next time your significant other wants to buy a home on the cheap- ask questions...lot's of questions.  Questions like- has anyone died  in and or around the house and is the house fricken haunted?

5443836,4,B00AJLHUYO,"We viewed this after viewing the clunker, A Haunting in Salem, which was horrible. (see separate review on Amazon.) This was much better, though a bit slow at times. It is a haunted house film, a bit like Paranomal activity, except this film doesn't involve demons or ghosts. It does make you think and wonder about what is going on in it. Ethan Hawke does a good job as the crime writer getting scared to death while trying to write the best true crime book he has ever written. Someone should have told him to be careful what you ask for, as he gets more than he expects with this on. First of all, this man moves his family into a house where the entire family was hanged and one of the children is missing without telling his family about it. Shame on him. It's not a slasher film.
Overall, I recommend seeing this one at least once, but don't watch it alone, and make sure you keep the lights on. There are some pretty jump out at you scary moments in this film. Whatever you do, don't let your kids watch it with you: Tthey will have nightmares.",1363996800,,1051,4.28643216080402

It was creepy as can be, it was twisty, it was different, it was unexpected and it had me on the edge of my seat!!! I thought it was good enough to call it original. And with the whole Mr. Boogie guy, HE really creeped me out! The back story of it was scary and intriguing... This movie creeps inside you and gets you where it's most uncomfortable! Knowing it's fake is the ONLY thing that saves you....... DO NOT SHOW THIS TO CHILDREN, OR ANYONE WHO GETS DISTURBED AT A MOVIE LIKE THIS, OR IS FRIGHTENED BY THE OCCULT, OR ANYONE WHO HAS NIGHTMARES OFTEN.

They said they watched it twice, and it even scared them the second time. What caught my interest the most was when they said ""I was too freaked out to even go to bed that night.""

So I broke down and rented it. Even more, I set myself up to be scared. I waiting until I was home alone and turned off all the lights to prepare myself to be frightened.

BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!
Not only was this movie not even mildly frightening, but it felt as though they took every cliche known to the horror genre and complied it into one movie. The acting was bad, the characters were poorly written and their ""scary people"" were more laughable than anything. Actually, I found myself giggling through several parts of the movie. It was, in my opinion, a predictable failure. Don't waste your money on this movie. You will only find yourself sighing and looking to see when it's going to end.

5443856,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister is another cookie cutter horror movie with a couple of original ideas in between a boatload of clichs. The original ideas are pretty entertaining and the ideas for murder are pretty neat but all in all it's pretty much the same stuff we've seen before.

You have a true crime writer who moves into a house once owned by a family that was slaughtered by a killer and, of course, now crazy things begin to happen. The reason the family doesn't move immediately is because the writer is more obsessed about his book than the well-being of his family. More things happen and couple predictable twists happen and I won't give anything away but the building suspense leads to exactly where you'd think it'd be an hour into it.

I watched this alone at night and it wasn't very scary. The scenes that were supposed to make you jump didn't and the gruesome scenes that were supposed to make you cringe only made you slightly uncomfortable.

The soundtrack was amazing though and I'll look into buying that cause it very unsettling and entertaining. The acting was as good as it needed to be and the cinematography was also well done.
If you're not used to horror movies it'd probably be a lot of fun but seasoned film watchers aren't going to be too impressed.",1363564800,,1261,4.595555555555555

Somethings you may see in the movie ( dead body, hanging, blood, drowning, lawnmower, knife, family, kids, fire, cops, attic, suspenseful music, yelling, murderer, etc)As a huge horror fan old and new this film is genuinely good. Find a room in your house, turn off the lights, make some popcorn and watch this movie. There are some parts that are disturbing such as the lawn mower scene. I didn't even watch it i closed my eyes. The gore however is done very well and it is nothing like Saw or Hostel or anything like that. This movie has so many elements to it and it really is a classic horror film.

One thing I saw coming was  Ellison Oswalt's(Ethan Hawke) reluctance and arrogance turned around and bit him in the ass. Also the 8MM films he kept watching were actually quite disturbing, they actually made me feel sad for these family's. The plot tied in nicely and the soundtrack solidly kept it all together. Ironically the music at the end when Ellison and his family are being chopped up, is by one of my favorite groups SunnO))))). The movie played great on my computer and I'm thinking about purchasing it on dvd. It's hard to find a good modern made horror flick now-a-days.",1363478400,,662,4.756521739130434

This is the darkest (and I mean literally) movie I've ever seen, no one turns on a light through the entire movie, instead they stumble through a dark house, making it impossible to see what's going on. 2. Bad dialog between Ethan and other actors. Pointless, over the top conversations go on and on. 3. It's just not scary. A couple of jolts, but scenes that are supposed to be terrifying come off almost laughable. Wanted to like it, but no - Try The Woman in Black for a better modern horror movie.

Bad guy looks scary, story has potential and that's it I'm sorry to say, there are parts so dumb it's painful. The movie could have been made so much better but the main character's actions are ridiculous so much that it's hard to enjoy the rest of the movie when he's being so dumb! I mean seriously if you move into a house with your family, discover that potentially a serial killer has returned the tapes of his killings to your attic after the crime was committed then you continue to stay there still, with your family totally at risk, I mean come on! The amount of times you think FOR GOD SAKE JUST GET OUT but he stays is just beyond belief, it's frustrating so much so you can't care for the character. He hears a noises, investigates in the dark, gets filmed by an unknown entity and pulled around by ghost hands and still stays pretty calm and stays with his wife and children in the home.

You can tell it annoyed me, it will annoy you, especially with so much potential. I could easily have restructured the screenplay as I'm sure most adults or children could have and got something worth 4* but it's maybe worth 2* at a push....nah!",1363305600,3,1169,4.382488479262673

5443881,3,B00AJLHUYO,"""Sinister"" doesn't develop very logically. What's more, it invokes a really exotic, far-fetched basis for its menace.  However, there are some memorably eerie, disturbing scenes in the film. So if you're looking more for sensation than for anything strictly sensible, you'll probably find this film worth your time.

In addition, there are a lot of good extras on this DVD. There are two fairly interesting director/writer commentaries.

Then, among the bonus materials, there is also a brief documentary about the market value fate of any real house which has a gruesome history. Brokers often have trouble selling such properties, at least for a decade or so. After that, purchasers occasionally come forward with the intention of making money off the shocking events that those walls witnessed. The new owners give tours, or challenge people to spend a night among the ghosts of those murders. This DVD documentary focuses on one such house in Villisca, Iowa, where a whole family fell victim to an axe murderer in the early 1900's.

So all in all, there's enough on this DVD to keep you watching - and watchful.",1363132800,21,1115,5.010810810810811

5443897,2,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister manages to combine a well-trodden hacked-together plot with some sub-par production values that even Ethan Hawke can't save. The story is about a crime writer who moves his family into a house where a previous family was murdered (seriously) and you can guess what happens from there. There are some super-8 snuff movies for extra value, all of which look like they were shot at some indie film school.

There's so much wrong with this film that it's hard to know where to start. At the basic level, it's really not scary - the ghost children have horrible make-up and the main scary guy (called Boogie) looks like a cheap Halloween mask. The lighting is so bad that you can't see enough from scene to scene. The music is distracting. The logic is weak and character motivations lacking. Ethan's token British wife is a very weak actress who provides little more than exposition. And despite being such a short flick, it feels overlong.

I didn't find a single idea or plot device that hasn't been ""borrowed"" from better horror films. I know that newbie directors like to shoot horror because it's cheap to make but when they don't know how to handle the genre, you end up with a mixed up mess that fails to scare.",1362873600,3,1223,4.631336405529954

5443906,2,B00AJLHUYO,"To enjoy a horror movie, one has to suspend their disbelief. I get that. I'm a huge fan of the genre and am used to acknowledging that the characters are going to be put into dire situations and behave in unrealistic ways. I do enjoy movies, such as Cabin in the Woods, that poke fun at that aspect of the genre, but I usually have no problem going along for the ride.

This movie really stretches what I am willing to accept, though. The  movie lost its ability to scare me because Ethan Hawke's character behaves so outlandishly. His character is a once-celebrated author whose last few real life crime stories did not sell well. He is so obsessed with once again becoming famous that he moves his family into the house where a family was murdered so he can investigate the crime.

This may be a spoiler, but, as it occurs fifteen minutes into the film, it's not much of one. Hawke's character finds a box in the attic that contains home Super 8s of a series of grisly murders. By comparing some photographs, he realizes that the box was left by someone after the police had cleaned the house. He does what any intelligent person would do. He calls the freaking cops.

But--this is a man who is desperate to regain his fame, so he hangs up the phone and decides to play Inspector Gadget himself. This is where I lost interest and all sympathy for our hero. Under the best case scenario, a brutal serial killer left a box of movies for you to find in your attic. At worst, something supernatural is afoot. Either way, do you stick around?

I also found this movie predictable. You can easily figure out ""whodunnit,"" so the big ""surprise"" ending wasn't much of one. I only kept watching to see if his wife would wise up and leave him. *Spoiler alert* She does not.

I guess the movie was creepy in spots, but it loses its tension early (and not just because Hawke's character is an a-hole). The scariest jump out of your seat moment happens about thirty minutes in. After that, we just see a drunk Hawke do a really pathetic job of investigating some murders with the help of a dingbat deputy and a professor played by Vincent D'Onofrio (who was the high point of the film).

I gave this movie two stars instead of one because I think Ethan Hawke, even in this dog, is an excellent actor. Other than his performance, seeing Fred Thompson as an a-hole sheriff (if only he had stayed on Law & Order and aborted the presidential run!!!), and a few cheap scares, this movie has little to offer.",1362700800,3,2490,4.435448577680525

Sinister takes the audience on a hair raising ride as you follow Ethan Hawke's character on a fact finding mission for his new book.  He is a true crime author and has unwittingly put himself and his family in danger.  This movie keeps you guessing and certainly keeps your imagination growing.  If you are thinking of watching this movie here is a checklist I feel you should complete ahead of time.  Fist off make sure you turn a light on if it is dark outside. If you are alone call a friend over to watch this with you because to watch Sinister alone is simply crazy!  Lastly next time you move to a new house and you go into your attic and there is a box of old films...DO NOT WATCH THEM!

5443910,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Watched movie last night. There's no doubt the movie has it's moments of scares. What could have been done much better was the ghost make up. I think it was a very poor job. I've watched budget scary movies that do a much better job at doing the make up. That kind of killed the whole scary theme of the movie. The ghosts looked more like they were Halloween costumes. The make up artist from this movie should take lessons from the people that do the make up from The Walking Dead series.

5443914,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Atmosphere ... atmosphere ... atmosphere. It looks like it would be hard to say as a potential tongue-twister, but it isn't. However, say ""Sinister"" over and over as fast as you can, and ... Class A Tongue Twister. Much like the story that makes up this little gem.

There is something to say about movies that can be frighteningly good--the kind that give you shivers down your spine and make the hair on your arms stand on end--without any over-the-top gore or torture porn thrown in to make up for shoddy scripts and poor acting. Classic movies that pulled it off stunningly were ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and ""The Exorcist,"" to name a few.  More recently, we've seen ""Insidious"" and ""The Cabin in the Woods"" do some magical stuff without all that bloody mess. Now we can add ""Sinister"" to that list.

""Sinister"" relies heavily on atmosphere, e.g. creepy, looped chanting and menacing music, dark hallways and darker corners, and a story that never gives you what you expect--always keeping you guessing. It was eerie, bizarre, and it kept my attention throughout.

The only reason I took off half a star for the movie in general was because the script was cheesy in spots. It was basically some awesome tension-tinged dialogue, and then something totally off the wall that no one has ever said or would ever say given the situation at hand. Those parts should have been rewritten or just edited out altogether because they were few and far between.

All in all, I found ""Sinister"" to be a well-crafted, well-acted, and well-filmed movie--a feather in the cap of the horror industry.

5443916,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Anyone who reads this column regularly knows that I am a horror fan. Sometimes it's to the point that I attempt to not write about a new horror release for fear people will think that's all I watch. But on occasion a movie comes along that I feel compelled to write about because it is just that good. Such is the case with SINISTER, a movie I missed in theaters but one that will stick with me now that I've watched it.

Ethan Hawke stars as Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author whose last two books didn't do so well after the roaring success of his first book. In search of a new story Ellison is moving his family, wife Tracy and children Trevor and Ashley, into a new home in a new town. What he doesn't tell them is that the house they are moving into was owned by the victims of a gruesome murder and possible abduction.

It seems that the family living there previously was executed in their own backyard. Bound with their heads covered by bags, they were stood on a bench with nooses round their necks. The opposite ends of those nooses were tied to a branch that fell, lifting them and strangling them. All the family with the exception of their little girl.

As they move in Ellison takes a box of loose items to store in the attic and finds a scorpion there. He drops the box on it to smash it which loosens a floorboard under which he discovers a box of super 8mm films. Taking these to his office where he's already hard at work on the story of the family, he watches the first movie which begins with clips of the family and then shows their execution. Rather than call the local police who are no big fans of his (with the exception of one deputy) due to his treatment of other officers in one of his books, he begins watching the other films.

Each night as Ellison works on his book and watches another film, he learns more about the killer. At the same time strange things begin to happen in the house. Noises, walking about in the attic, all draw his attention away from the book to see what is happening. Several of these incidents end up being a child searching for the bathroom in a new house or his son having night terrors, something he has suffered from in the past. But other items happened for reasons best left unsaid.

Each roll of film reveals another family that seems fine until their death throws are captured on film. While watching the second film, Ellison catches a glimpse of something in the waves reflected on the pool a family is being drowned in. The image is that of a face but distorted. Subsequent films offer more glimpses of the possible killer as well as symbols at each one.

With the assistance of the deputy Ellison is put in touch with a university professor the police sometimes contact for dealings in the occult of cults. This professor provides Ellison with some of the clues he's been looking for as well as part of the connection between these families. But it isn't until the last moments of the movie when he gets the one item that ties it all together. Before he gets that information the question of Ellison's sanity is called into play and just whether or not he's dreaming things or they are actually happening is answered.

I've seen a lot of horror films, so many that I couldn't tell you the last time one of them actually scared me. This film did just that. When it was finished I found myself thinking that perhaps sleeping with the lights on that night might be a good thing. Yes there are a few predictable jump moments but there are some even I wasn't prepared for. At one point I checked my pulse and found that it was indeed racing just a bit.

Hawke has had good and bad movies both in his career. This time around he does it right offering just the tiniest hint of possible insanity but lots of proof that he is definitely frightened and a bit disgusted by what he sees on screen. His character is determined to have that success of a hit book one more time but begins to wonder if the cost of his family is worth it.

The best way to truly experience this film is sitting in the dark, the phone unplugged and every other distraction taken away. But if you tend to jump at the smallest thing, if you have nightmares induced by these sort of films and if you just don't like feeling your skin crawl you might want to watch it with the lights on.

I want to say that this is not an ""entertaining"" movie, but rather horrific and chilling. I had not expected the plot turns out the way it did. No form of rationality ever entered in this story. Basically, it's about a writer who's trying to get his 15-minute fame and got his family to move into a house that was previously owned by a deceased family (but his family didn't know that then). The writer (played by Ethan Hawke) has discovered a box full of Super 8 films in the attic, showing a number of families and their deaths, prompt him to investigate the murders and to find out who was the killer. Instead of telling the police of what he really discovered, his own motivation was fame-seeking rather than protecting his family. In the end, what he really wanted to find out, he got with a chilling surprise.

Admittedly, this film is pretty original with some expected minor storylines. But, overall, it's a good scary movie. After watching this, I never slept well for a long time.",1362614400,,1139,4.605911330049261

Then he stumbles around his house in the small hours of the morning jumping at scary sounds but for some reason he never turns on a light. EVER.

Remember the scene in trailers where the boy crawls backwards out of the box? Yeah, that's like the ONLY incident that's halfway creepy and it happens really early on in the movie too (you get the feeling they put that scene in just to have something interesting to put in the trailers). If anything, the haunting gets less scary as the story progresses.

In the last 30 min of the film he gets spooked out mostly by his own moral depravity and decides to take his family and move in the middle of the night back to their real home, a huge mansion in the country you see all of 2 minutes of before the ""surprise"" ending of the film when a demonic child-eating Lucha Libre wrestler shows up and...

Movie from what I was actually able to see, 1 hour,  was filmed in the dark. The ghostly children were in bad make-up. Not a fan of alcoholism, not sure why they added the main actor to be a drunk, chasing children spirits in the dark with his baseball bat. All while family is asleep.

That was one thing about the scary face seen throughout this movie. I did get freaked out through a few parts of this but I honestly spent more time thinking, ""Why?"". Maybe that's part of the horror movie experience, sitting there and screaming at the TV or thinking, ""Why would you do that?"".

I think the best part of this movie was the music. It had some very unique and creepy music that was more memorable than the actual movie. I do like Ethan Hawke however, he always chooses weird, artsy films. His girlfriend/wife was unremarkable and he had zero chemistry with her. How she didn't know what house they were living in is beyond me. Overall it wasn't the worst horror movie I've seen and did have some unique concepts.

As a frame of reference, before Sinister, the two movies over the past decade or so that have creeped me out to a similar level were The Ring and Paranormal Activity (the first movies of both series).  Sinister is a genuinely creepy, chilling type of movie. Little to no gore, little to no profanity, no nudity -- just images and sounds that are downright creepy. I'm typically not the type to see a movie multiple times in the theatre, but like The Ring and Paranormal Activity, this was one I saw multiple times both for my own enjoyment and to show it to others to see their reactions to the creepiest parts!

5443955,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I want to start by saying I am a huge Ethan Hawke fan, and I feel he has never received the credit he is due as an artist. I was not sure what to make of this movie at first, as I played it upon arrival but was really not in the mood to watch it.  So I put it away and played it again much later and over and over. This is a fantastic ""horror"" movie not only in its ability to keep you spellbound, but also in its ability to make you think. It also the affect which PYSCHO has on most people (well at least in 1961 when I saw it) and that is the gore you think you see is not really there...it is your imagination run wild.

Hawke plays his role very close to the vest and very calculated. His angst rises in a slow manner until the movies climax. His pre-climatic scares are extremely believable in context of the movie plot. No screams or horrors which are not appropriate (unlike many horror movies).  The story lines continues to unfold with unexpected twists and turns, while Hawke takes us closer and closer to his unknowing abyss.

The production and execution is believable and the other characters are well developed, particularly Deputy So-and So and Hawke's wife. Once again their quiet unease develops slowly and over time but in a believable manner. The story and horror are featured in such a way that there are no actual gory scenes, and those ideas are strictly left to the viewer. The psychological component is what makes this movie a GREAT horror flick.

There are ""horror"" movies and there are ""horror"" movies. One relies on actual scenes, blood and carnage to makes its point. There is a place in film for that. But the truly good and great horror films rely on your imagination to work...SINISTER does just that.",1362355200,,1734,4.40625

5443964,1,B00AJLHUYO,"I was hooked into streaming this film by the trailer.  I do like Ethan Hawke, and even though this film was coming from the creators of that abysmal dreck ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", I wanted to give it a chance.  It cost $3.99 to stream on Amazon, and almost certainly is not worth that much.  This is a $1 rental at best folks.  Better yet wait a year and it will be streaming for free--trust me you aren't missing anything.

Ignoring for a moment the obviousness of the story, and how easy it is to figure out where it's going before it gets there, the ending is utterly anticlimactic and rushed in a way that is particularly annoying after the 100 minutes of buildup.  I'm sure most people wanted to see Ethan's character fight ""Mister Boogie"" in some way--even if he lost.  No such luck--instead the director was counting on shocking you with the banal twist ending that you figured out sixty minutes earlier.  Since that failed utterly, the ending is just a let-down.

The movie tries to use jump-scares and loud noises to frighten you, but the repetition left me cold.  It's scary when Ethan walks down a hallway and a ghostly child appears behind him.  It's not scary when it happens five times.  In a row.  Overdoing the scares makes them boring instead of scary.  ""And now a weird noise"" is not something you should be thinking right before the director tries to scare you with a weird noise.

The characters behave in mind-numbingly stupid ways.  Hawke wanders around his house carrying a baseball bat at night because he hears someone moving around... and walks past light switch after light switch without ever flipping one on.  Ever.  There is no way any sane thinking person wouldn't flip on each and every single light in his situation.  Which means he is deliberately not doing it because it wouldn't be ""spooky"" with the lights on.  Which makes the whole thing feel contrived and destroys the tension.

Finally, the whole film is shot too damned dark.  You can't see anything half the time.  This doesn't add to the tension or the fear, although it may have you frustratedly checking to see how much more time you are going to have to spend watching this train wreck.

In short, the only frightening thing about this picture is that it probably won't be Scott Derrickson's last.

Just after I watched this film, it confirmed what we all know: that gallons of blood, and weird monsters, are not exactly what makes a movie this really scary, and keep the audience so interested throughout the movie.

Some of the things I really enjoy is the way the camera moves. Since the opening scene, the way the front of the house is presented to us, screams something very dark is going to happen. The acting is great, specially by the 'family man' (the novel writer) who knows how to transmit suspense more often than not. Very good actor choice to perform the writer character.

After seen so much horror garbage out of Hollywood, where either one knows right away what is going to happen next, or rather than be scared, one leave the theater laughing at the silly script/poor acting, well, this is a very refreshing movie in the sense that it let us know that still there is talent left to impress us big time.",1362182400,,1006,4.427027027027027

I was watching Sinister with my boyfriend and within the first 15 minutes of watching it, I turned to my boyfriend and said ""I bet the entity is using children to do his bidding.""  Lo and behold, that is exactly what this film is about.

The opening scene is provided as a shock factor (the scene of the a family being hanged), to automaticaly grasp onto the attentions of the viewers, but it did not amuse me in the least.  It feels as if this movie was just created as an excuse to show murder scenes in first person viewing, and a story was quickly created to surround this desire to create gruesome endings for these unfortunate characters in the film.

The set-up of the plot was cliche, the characters were generic horror movie victims and there were a lot of plot holes (esepcially in regard to the antagonist - he did not seem to have a legitimate reason for taking people's lives other than the fact that he ""needed energy."")  While I'm on the subject of the antagonist, I am going to address his appearance: it was RIDICULOUS.  He was not scary.  He just looked like someone dressing up as a band member from Slipknot for Halloween.

Overall, poor plot, dumb villian, waste of time.  I would not recommend this movie.",1362182400,2,1250,4.491150442477876

5443975,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Full review from Film Phreak! Visit us at filmphreak.tumblr.com
SINISTER is an amazing balance of traditional film storytelling and the found footage motif. Of course, ever since Blair Witch (and revitalized with Paranormal Activity) there has been an unceasing gush of found footage flicks. Now, that may be an issue for some, but not for me. I like the genre overall. Not that there aren't bad versions of the conceit but the genre as a whole isn't trash, it just requires patience and an appreciation for the slow burn, a phrase Ive seen bandied about SINISTER. Not every horror movie is about shock and awe - for the record, I LIKE shock and awe horror - and the found footage genre, while it does depend on shock, gets its shocks from atmosphere and flashes of terror rather than by unleashing horror weapons of mass dismemberment. As it happens, there are a number of gruesome murders as part of SINISTERs sinister story but there are shown, but obliquely, suggested askew with cinematographic techniques, more than hints, peeks, perhaps, of the violence that is part and parcel of SINISTER. But with SINISTER whats important is knowing that these things happened, not seeing it in gory detail. It aint that kinda movie. SINISTER is about building tension while being creepy in tone right from the start. Its a build that has as much hook as anything in the [name of torture porn[ franchise. Its not the same kinda movie, but its as suspense filled as John Carpenters Halloween and - dareIsayit?yesIdaresayit - and is qualitatively every bit as good. Its one of the scariest of the found footage movies, ranking right up there with my favorites, such as VHS and GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 1 & 2. But, as I mentioned, this is not only found footage, but a blend. Im going to say little about the plot, for both spoiler reasons and the fact that Im not a plot regurgitator/synopsis-book-report kinda critic. Ill say this much: The found footage is grafted perfectly into the normal cinematic narrative by way of reels of home movies containing distressing and murderous footage; these reels are integral to the plot. Ethan Hawke is a true crime writer trying to keep his family together as well as struggling to write another bestseller (his last one came out years ago) to keep his family afloat. Hes driven and the family move into the house where the crimes occurred that Hawke is writing about places great stress on family members and  well, lets just say its nice to have some REAL drama incorporated into a horror movie. We need it. It invests us in the family and in this film, thats vital for the movie to conjure fear. But  I was talking about the mix of found footage and regular filmmaking. The reels of home movies turn up in the attic of the house and become the rabbit hole down which Hawke drags himself and his loved ones. This one goes on my DVD rack of awesome favorite horror movies.",1362182400,,2897,4.6895874263261295

5443983,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I've been interested in the work of Director / Writer Scott Derrickson since hearing he was a Christian many years back. I was fascinated to find someone else who shared not only my basic religious beliefs but also had a passion for the horror and science fiction genres I love so much. It's not often you hear of Christians who are successful in Hollywood.

Derrickson has an impressive resume of films and actors he's worked with over the years. His early endeavors consist of writing ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" and directing and penning ""Hellraiser: Inferno."" He moved on to take the helm of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Both of these films starred well-respected actors like Keanu Reeves, Laura Linney, and Tom Wilikinson. His latest film ""Sinister"" ranks at the top of his filmmaking career.

True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) gained notoriety ten years ago with a book about a grisly murder. After a couple unsuccessful novels, Oswald is looking to repeat his success and return to the top of the bestseller list. He takes up residence in the home where the victims he's investigating actually lived and were killed.

While moving in, he discovers a box of Super 8 movies which hold footage of several brutal murders that he believes somehow tie together. As Oswald digs deeper into each crime, his world begins to crumble around him. Is he losing his sanity or is there a supernatural force out to get him and his family?

""Sinister"" is the culmination of everything good about several horror sub-genres. You have the ""Paranormal Activity"" found footage concept covered through the use of the Super 8 films. People who enjoy movies with supernatural entities like the ones in ""The Grudge,"" ""Boogeyman,"" and others of that nature will enjoy it. Those who crave modern day ghost stories like ""The Pact,"" ""The Apparition,"" and ""Insidious"" will love it as well. There really is something for every type of horror enthusiast in ""Sinister.""

The movie isn't a sloppy hodge-podge of those movies, either. Derrickson ties everything together with a script that makes sense and a story that is well-paced and intriguing. It has slow-burning suspense and jump-scares combined together to keep you on the edge of your seat and nervously awaiting the next disturbing scene.

Several special features are included in the DVD version of ""Sinister."" There are two separate audio commentaries featuring Director / Writer Scott Derrickson and Co-writer C. Robert Cargill. It also contains two featurettes entitled ""True Crime Authors"" and ""Living in a House of Death."" Deleted scenes include optional audio commentary by Director Scott Derrickson. Lastly, we get a trailer for the film.

""Sinister"" is a satisfying horror film which will appeal to many types of fright fans. It's a successful combination of old and new tricks. When it comes to what we see onscreen, it has more in common with Hitchcock than it does gorier fare like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the likes. Viewers who like a twisty storyline which leaves something for your imagination visually will enjoy ""Sinister.""",1362096000,,3126,5.034816247582205

The premise was interesting enough and if they would have explored the lore behind the entity and the images it might have worked.  I had the film figured out way before the final scene.  I think anyone who has watched enough horror movies will probably get it.  There was a definite creepiness to the whole super 8 film thing, but just not enough to make me really get scared by this movie.  The scenes with the husband and wife where way to melodramatic and they just didn't deliver on the spooks when they had apple opportunity.

5443995,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Much to my enormous pleasure, I viewed the 2012 horror film ""Sinister"" and discovered one of the great works of a venerable genre. It's a masterpiece, and certainly the best horror film since the 2007 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist/dp/B003TNM2K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist</a>. I like to think I'm a horror film expert. There was a Friday night ""late show"" in Dallas during the 1970s, and I had the good fortune to watch an endless run of classic Universal horror films. Traveling through a sea of black and white, I marveled to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-1931/dp/B002RXZF6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein (1931)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-1931/dp/B002MG2RG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula (1931)</a>, ""The Wolf Man,"" ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" -- you name it. I've avoided the torture porn of recent years, as true horror must have a dose of the supernatural. I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B000KE5JES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, though hated the imitators.

Film critics have not been kind to ""Sinister."" A queasy lot, they almost always miss the boat when it comes to great horror. Like British ghost stories of the 19th century, subtle skill is necessary to pull off the tale, and ""Sinister"" has achieved its plateaus with unexpected success. The most important key is a good cast. Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Vincent D'Ornofrio and James Ransone are an unusually talented team. Hawke especially gives a near-brilliant effort as a tortured writer possessed by the compulsion of solving a mystery.

The set-up is a marvel, as Hawke plays true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt. Like Ann Rule before him, he travels to towns of notorious crimes to investigate details for his latest book. Oswalt has stumbled of late, as finances are tight, and he needs a bestseller. From desperation comes risk. Unknown to his wife and two children, he's purchased the isolated home where an entire family hung themselves from a backyard tree. In a splendid early scene, the local sheriff (Thompson) frowns on Oswalt's family as they move into the house. Familiar with the author, he says simply, ""I want you to know this is in bad taste,"" a classic line. Mrs. Dudley, the infamous caretaker of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunting/dp/B004WNTJP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunting</a>, could not have set up a more uncomfortable atmosphere.

I love the house, a common brick structure likely built in the 1960s. It's just modern enough to lack menace, with no hanging shutters or boarded windows. Towering pines surround the property, making the living room dark even at midday. Hallways stretch for miles, as they usually do in an empty house, and there's an attic. Oswalt prefers to work at night as the subject matter he's investigating is inappropriate for his young children. There are bangs and creaks throughout the structure, later explained in terrifying detail. In the darkest corner of the attic he discovers 8mm home movies and a projector. His investigation evolves as the dusty films detail the family's murders. In the tradition of Thomas in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blow-Up/dp/B0000WN0ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blow Up</a>, he must blow up frames from the footage to reveal clues in the hazy background.

That's as far as I'm going, as the mystery evolves with unbearable tension. We like Oswalt, his sympathetic wife Tracy (well played by theater veteran Rylance) and his clever kids. This is a good, Bohemian family. Like Rosemary Woodhouse, Eleanor Lance, Robert Thorn and Father Karras before them, we want to protect these decent people from the growing evil engulfing their lives. The triumph of ""Sinister"" is we genuinely like the characters and care about their safety.

Director Scott Derrickson has evolved and ""Sinister"" is his most assured work. He gave us the the surprisingly good&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcism-of-Emily-Rose-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0019CB5T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcism of Emily Rose (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>], though followed with the crappy remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still-2008/dp/B001THAS5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)</a>. ""Sinister"" is an example of his maturation and growing expertise within the medium. His screenplay, co-written with C. Robert Cargill, is ingenious. Having read quite a few true crime novels, I've often wondered if such authors as Rule, Vincent Bugliosi and John Douglas have felt a moment's guilt for making a living off the terrible fate of others. Has such investigation opened the door to unknown evils? Are they haunted by the figurative ghosts of the victims, hovering above their typewriters, perhaps exposing a disturbing thread connecting all unexpected horrors of life?

I once worked in a Texas town where a husband killed his wife in a newly built home. A young couple soon moved into the same house and, a year later, the husband killed his wife in the front yard. The cosmic coincidence caused the house to remain unoccupied for years. It's a common enough suburban structure, residing on a block without the slightest clue of menace (sort of like that house in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poltergeist/dp/B00471TLZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poltergeist</a>). But I wouldn't spend a single night in such a place. Like the house in ""Sinister,"" it stands alone, its doors better left forever locked.",1362009600,,5974,6.323926380368098

There's just enough given so you understand what's going without it being ridiculously, over-the-top gory.  Just enough is left out to make you wonder what will happen next, at least until the understated scary parts sneak up on you. The wife got on my nerves, the writer, he was really into his book to get into his subjects' heads like that, and his kids were involved whether they wanted to be or not.  The house and the dead took charge of everything almost immediately. I'd love to watch this movie again. Moral of this movie?

He comes off in this film not as a desperate, struggling writer, but as a guy with an over developed sense of entitlement. The writing is boring and and the direction seems confused, both making the plot suffer.

5443998,3,B00AJLHUYO,"This is an above average ghost story in spite of some obvious silliness.  A true crime novelist (Ethan Hawke) who was a big success with his first book but not so much on 2 follow-ups is feeling the pressure to get out another hit.  He focuses on a small town in upstate New York and moves there with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and 2 children (Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley).

What he doesn't tell them is that they are actually moving into the house owned by a family of 5 that were summarily hanged in the back yard.  Well, all but one girl who was never found.  Things start to go bump in the night but only Ellison (Hawke) seems to notice.  Lured into the attic, he finds an 8 mm film projector and a handful of family film reels.  When he watches them he discovers typical family gatherings but the videos abruptly change to the brutal murders of each family dating back to 1966.  So what is the common element here?

For help, Jack calls in a friendly sheriff deputy (James Ransone).  Strange things are happening with the kids too.  The boy sleepwalks and has terrible nightmares.  The girl draws on walls and has invisible relationships.  The movie is elevated by Hawke as he tries to tie the crimes together like a CSI investigator.  Unfortunately the film slips into traditional territory as Ellison sinks into looneyville and starts to see apparitions and one evil looking dude.  He finally sees the light and skedaddles out of their before it's too late.  Or is it?

It does not rely on special effects or buckets of blood and guts; instead it plays on the deep dark fears that many of us have. The use of grainy, super 8 film to show the various murders was very effective. The tilted camera angles and faded color did more to send a chill down my spine than any computer generated effect or gory scenes of blood and guts.

The acting is great. The filming , lighting and imagery are all done perfectly to add to a very atmospheric and creepy movie. The script isn't anything new, but the story manages to have a fresh feel because it is handled in a fresh way.

5444016,3,B00AJLHUYO,"While the story was well-woven, it was a bit light on actual scares.  My small pet peeves include when people are searching a darkened house and simply refuse to flick on a light switch to see what is going on ( this movie had a case of chronic darkness ).  I know it's for effect, but I just couldn't get around it.  Also, the local deputy was a bit of an inept charicature who ends up delivering more solid information in the movie than anyone else, not sure why they designed him that way.  I enjoyed Ethan Hawke ( although they never give him a wardrobe change ), and it was good to see Fred Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio included ( albeit uncredited ).

The ending did tie is up neatly in a bow, but it's like the whole movie was designed just to deliver the ending, and kind of missed throughout.  The key pieces to the story, the local police's warnings, the son's night terrors, and the girl's 'friend', were all kinda glossed over, which left the substance of the story somewhat light.  Ironically, it is not a short movie, checking in at just under two hours, so I felt there was time to deliver more.

The violence itself was graphic and suspensefully delivered, but it wasn't enough to make it genuinely scary.  Granted, it avoided some of the pitfalls of other supernatural horror films, but it felt like The Believers meets Blair Witch, and the result was just 'okay'.",1361750400,,1383,4.47808764940239

If you've ever yelled at the girl for running back into the house where the killer is, you'll for sure spend 90% of this film yelling at Ethan Hawke to turn a light on in his house.  Most of this movie occurs in the dark, which sets the proper mood, but defies all logic.  Hawke literally walks past light switches to investigate strange happenings.  It took me out of the movie at times.  No one was ever killed in my home, but I still turn lights on when I enter rooms- not because I'm scared, but so I can ""see"".

This is one terrifying movie, a story well told and an instant classic. The cast is superb and performances are top notch all the way around. However, it's Ethan Hawke in perhaps his best performance since ""Before the Devil Knows you're dead"" who carries the film in a tour de force performance as unsolved murder case writer  Ellison Oswalt who  when asked early on in an interview if he would ever write for money exclaims ""I would rather cut off my hands"". We learn quickly  that this isn't entirely true as he willingly puts his wife and two young children in harms way.

Hawke's descent into some gray fog between terror and madness has a surgical precision to it -- and it's riveting to watch. ""Sinister"" doesn't waste time as Cinematographer Chris Norr creates an ominous and disturbing world of shadow and light, and the feeling of being watched is palatable. Director and Co Writer Scott Derrickson avoids the expected and cliche' like the plague. Coaxing genuine performances he understands that an audience has to connect with the actors on screen and we do and we do at an almost visceral level. This is smart, terrifying story telling.

Aside from a bit of blood splatter there is no gore here and fans of splatter films are sure to be disappointed because ""Sinister"" does have one pre requisite - it requires you to think an demands you let go. The horror in terms of violent atrocities are suggestive and that too is smart. The greatest horror films that have stood the test of time knew this. They banked on it. The directors knew that nothing, absolutely nothing on the screen can compete with the imagination and that to try is to fail.

Roger Ebert whom I have great admiration and respect for was disappointed that the demons identity is revealed so early in the film. But I disagree. In ""Fallen"" we know very early in the film the demon is Azazel, in ""The Rite"" we learn almost immediately  Anthony Hopkins is possessed by a demon named Baal and of course the early introduction of the big cheese himself  - Satan - makes an appearance early on in many films including such legendary classics as the Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby.

""Sinister"" is not so much a film of possession, it doesn't drag in the over played Church versus Demon formula that requires you to believe in God for any chance of absolution from the terror unfolding on the screen. It's a deliberate and welcome choice.

Impressive cameos by both Fred Thompson as sheriff and an uncredited performance as a famous professor of the occult is wonderfully played by accomplished actor Vincent D'Onofrio. A Solid cast, un nerving and deeply disturbing ""Sinister"" is a haunting and impeccable made film.

""Sinister"" shows us that things really do go bump in the night and the dire consequences when we bump back.",1361750400,3,3060,4.720450281425891
5444026,1,B00AJLHUYO,"I'm surprised to see such good reviews for this predictable pile of trash of a horror movie. The only plus, as far as I'm concerned, is that they used some totally unexpected ""boards of canada"" songs to flesh out the soundtrack.

Nothing about this movie was scary beyond the flashlight scenes. The ending (and build up the ending) was plain stupid. I feel like I've already watched this movie 20 times. It wasn't even as good as my memory of the movies it's ripping off.

Ethan Hawke? Sure, I remember him from some random s*** in my youth. But his acting was marginal, his wife clearly wasn't his wife, and oh... did I forget to mention? The plot was s***ty and predictable.

The fact that this pile of sheets has so many good reviews on amazon makes me question the entire review system.",1361664000,2,790,4.510489510489511
5444027,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Disclaimer: I've loved Ethan Hawke since ""Dead Poets Sociey.""  But I'm also a huge horror movie fan so would have seen ""Sinister"" regardless of his starring role.  As others have commented -- and as I comment in all my reviews of horror movies -- the bar has been set pretty low for horror flicks in the past few years, and I've wondered if all the good material has been used up.  ""Sinister"" does borrow a lot from other films; most notably it borrows its central theme from ""The Shining.""  Hawke plays a true crime writer (in real life he is a writer in addition to an actor, which added something to the movie for me), looking to reclaim the glory of his past success.  He's also a husband and father who has obligations which compete with his career aspirations.  Although his character, Ellison Oswalt, is a much better father than Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining,"" there is definitely a comparison to be made here in terms of men feeling like their wife and kids are weighing them down a bit.  There's also a found footage aspect which is central to the plot, and a kind of, sort of haunted house they're living in where the family Ellison is writing about was murdered.  For all of its tried and true plot points, I will say that for the first time in a long time while watching a horror movie, I wasn't able to figure out the ending until it ended -- which I consider to be a huge plus.

However I'm not sure if my inability to guess the culmination of events didn't have something to do with the film's odd pacing.  I felt like it started in the middle of the first act...there was very little scene setting...we're in the thick of things pretty much from the get go.  And then when I thought I was at the end of the second act, it turned out I was in the middle of the third -- there's a sudden, rapid acceleration of the plot that's kind of jarring. On a positive note, this was a refreshing change from movies that go on and on.

What does happen in ""Sinister?""  Actually, not much.  Most of the movie takes place in and on the grounds of the murder victims' house -- we frequently see their murder scene replayed throughout the movie (in fact, this is the first image we see).  Ellison spends most of the time in his home office watching old Super 8 films he found in the creepy attic that depict homicides of additional families in other locations.  We're supposed to believe that Ellison's desire for another best seller keeps him from turning this footage over to the authorities.  As he investigates the murders spooky things happen in the house, he uncovers a few details that shed some light on the situation, yadda yadda yadda, I don't like to give too much away.

The key here is ""supposed to believe,"" and a lot of Ellison's actions in the movie aren't believable, but Hawke's acting is, thereby redeeming the weak plotting (other reviewers say this too).  Another thing that at least one other reviewer commented on is that the lights in the house are always off; one of the first scenes is the family eating dinner together in the near dark.  This did add a lot to the creepy feeling of the movie, but it was also disctracting as every time I saw a light switch in the background I wanted to scream, ""Turn on the lights!"" at my TV.  There is a scene where a law enforcement officer whose character resembles Dewey from the ""Scream"" franchise says something to Ellison along the lines of, ""If I lived in this house I'd sleep with the lights on,"" and it perhaps came off as more comical than it should have.

I still found the movie to be effective because it doesn't give itself away and the found footage is disturbing without being gross -- although this movie is certainly not suitable for kids or anyone with delicate sensibilities and overall, the movie is perhaps beyond disturbing (but you have to get to the end to find out how much so).  I watched it yesterday and am still a little creeped out.  I like it better the day after than I did while I was watching it...although I certainly didn't want to fast forward...which for a horror movie these days is definitely not a bad thing.",1361664000,3,4125,4.447543160690571

Yeah.. this movie doesn't ever really work.  It's not even worth the time to write why...

5444043,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I watch horror movies all the time; they tend to run the gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes the bad can be funny enough that they become good.  This movie plays it pretty straight (as it is essentially a bigger budget mass market horror movie).  Not truly a horror movie but a thriller with horror elements would be a better definition.

Anyway, it's a movie that relies on ""found footage"" to the extent that the main character is essentially discovering the truth by watching movies he found in the attic of the house.  The ""bad guy"" (baghuul) isn't really omnipresent throughout the movie, more or less this is a character driven horror movie with the bad guy being a ""spectre"" in the background (there but rarely shown or presence only shown through the aftermath of events).

It's a great movie and fairly disturbing as far as these mass market movies go...not the movie itself but the home videos the guy is watching are very disturbing; I mean it basically shows murders and because of the way they're shot these murders look believable and real.  If they had cast the wife as a better actress (you know...one that doesn't have an unbelievably bad accent and can actually act) then the movie would've been far better.  Whenever she comes on screen she just hamm's up a movie that shouldn't have any hamm; overly dramatic bad acting from the woman that doesn't match the situation(s).

Otherwise good movie.",1361577600,,1412,4.7306122448979595
5444044,2,B00AJLHUYO,"I saw this movie had a decent rating on imdb and amazon so rented via amazon hoping it would scare, but I found myself more or less irritated by all the cliches.  I don't like being pandered to, and that's what this heavy-handed Hollywood by-the-numbers horror tale does.  (Some spoilers follow.)

There's the scary-face-paint supernatural villain.  (Do supernatural villians really need to doll themselves up to be scary?) The creepy children.  Who, might I add, turn their heads sideways in the Hollywood-approved scary-child-is-scary fashion.  The parent who actually sees something that would send REAL parents on a one way trip outta the house with kids in their arms, yet decides to stay.  My favorite for this particular movie -- the adult who has been experiencing strange phenomena in his new house yet constantly blunders around the house in total darkness.  Flip the light switch on, you goober!  And of course there's lots of herky-jerky motion because we all know how terrifying THAT is.  (Oh brother.)

You can feel all the parts being put into place in this obvious Hollywood product. You can actually hear them falling into position -- thunk, thunk, thunk.  Ending obvious?  Very.

One issue with this expensive production is it telegraphs its scares.  What scares us most is what we aren't sure of --  the unknown.  But this movie ladles out its scary beings -- you see them early and often, and there's even the music that assures you that what's happening is scary, just in case you missed the freaky demon-child shadowing our hero.

Speaking of whom, character development here is nearly non-existent, so really, who CARES what happens to this generic Hollywood family?  That's not to say the cast don't try, but they aren't given much to work with.

This movie is really just another confirmation that a big budget often is a scare-killer.  Having a micro-budget forces you to scare by suggestion, and those are the truest and scariest scares of them all.

If you like the by-now familiar bag of tricks in Hollywood's ""new horror,"" you may like this.  If for you horror is edge of your seat suspense followed by real frights, Sinister doesn't have much to offer.",1361577600,2,2183,4.904371584699454

I started seeing things in the shadows as my imagination got the better of me.  This would have been a great date movie...but watching it by myself was a mistake.

I really like this movie and will watch it again at Halloween.  It's a new favorite of mine.  What I like about it is that it almost reminds me of a 70s or 80s movie...in that it's about a family that encounters the supernatural and there is not a lot of gratuitous blood and gore.  It's not a slasher movie or a torture porn thing or any of the self-referential garbage that constitutes horror movies in the 2000s and 2010s.  This is more old school horror and it creates a new villain that I hope turns up in other movies under the Sinister banner.

I really like just about everything about this movie.  I think the only thing I might have changed would have been the actress who played the mother.  She was randomly British or Australian for no reason...and that threw me.

I am not a big fan of Ethan Hawke in general, but I liked him in this.

Peppered throughout the film, are suspenseful moments, and some quirky characters. The movie is wonderfully shot, and lit. At times you will be peering into the darkness to see if you can make out the antagonist. The Super 8 footage looks awesome as well. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you have to see a horror movie in theaters go see this! It's an ORIGINAL movie!

Ethan Hawke's character wandered through the house at night to investigate all the bumps and sounds, and DOESN'T EVEN TURN ON A SINGLE LIGHT!  LOL  I guess that's what gives this movie it's edge.

5444075,1,B00AJLHUYO,"Spoiler Alert! I hated this movie. The other negative reviewers here pretty much touched on everything I didn't like about the movie. I too found myself wondering why doesn't anyone turn on a light. Also made no sense that the entity haunted the family at one house only to wait to kill them in their other home. What weird switch was flipped there just because of a move from one building to another? There also was no inclination that the youngest child was being corrupted in anyway. If pictures were a portal, when did she see them? Most of the movie was spent showing grainy and graphic murder scenes on home movies. The wife was oblivious that she was living in a murder house. Really? With today's technology there's no way she couldn't have known about such a horrid thing unless she was living under a rock.

All this I could've overlooked and would have had it not been for the ending of this movie. I really wanted to like this movie and it could've been really good. The story had so many other directions it could've taken but it stuck to what I figured was going to happen 2/3 of the way through. It could've been a creepy and intellectual thriller say had the villain turned out to be an actual serial killer or cult doing the murdering or even if had the local sheriff been in a little more on the sinister things going on than anyone realized. There were so many routes the plot could've gone. Instead it chose to have an entity hypnotize children to kill their families so the entity could then have the child for dinner. Thank you but no thank you. The ending made me sick. I find the idea of children murdering their own families then being eaten by some supernatural being sick not scary. I usually keep a movie on my DVR till it expires so that someone else can watch it before its gone. I deleted this as soon as the credits rolled. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",1361404800,14,1898,4.422857142857143

I agree with one of the other reviewers that the producer, director and actors must all be writing their opinions of this movie on the sly to give it such high ratings on Amazon and other sites. The premise for the story was a good one, if someone had written a better script- unfortunately,they didn't.  Many scenes were obviously copied/stolen from other more successful movies in this genre. I feel this film had some of the worst acting, directing, editing, makeup and special effects I've ever seen.  The first half was so boring it almost put me to sleep, except for the fact that it was interspersed with frequent scenes of senseless, redundant and bloody family massacres all done in Super-8. It was sad and disgusting, but scary-no.  You know its a bad movie when you start rooting for villain, like I did, verbally encouraging him to kill off the protagonist and his family ""particularly his whiny English wife"" to get even with them for luring me into paying my hard earned money to rent such a crappy movie.",1361318400,,1103,4.583756345177665

5444080,4,B00AJLHUYO,"SINISTER is an eerie, atmospheric and original reworking of the found footage plotting.  Director Scott Derrickson, who gave us the excellent EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, crafts the tale of an egocentric novelist looking to match the success of his first best seller by chronicling the disappearance of a young girl whose remaining family was brutally murdered.  He locates a set of very disturbing videotapes that propel him into a terrifying mystery.
Ethan Hawke is superb as novelist Ellison Oswalt, giving an earnest portrayal of a man embroiled in a frightening scenario.  Juliet Raylans is less impressive as his loyal, but frustrated wife.  Law & Order alum Vincent D'Onofrio and Fred Dalton Thomas have very brief but effective cameos.  The music is often effectively chilling and suitably irritating which adds to the edginess of the film.
SINISTER isn't an ""enjoyable"" film per se but it's definitely a good horror film.",1361318400,,925,5.181208053691275
5444081,4,B00AJLHUYO,"What do you get if you take ""Amityville Horror,"" ""The Ring,"" and ""The Shining,"" mix them together, and make one film?  ""Sinister,"" of course.

Now usually, I'm not a fan of the whole found-footage genre.  And I also find films where the main protagonist is an author to be somewhat ""lazy"" -- it's not too hard for a writer to add this type of character since he's lived it himself.  However, the found-footage ""stuff"" is necessary to drive the plot -- and perhaps even a possible theme, discussed below -- and I actually liked the way that Ethan Hawke played the writer character here.  So I think that both of these elements worked.

It seems that the director and screenwriter were trying to introduce the following theme:  what we watch truly does affect who we are, and how we think.  While the protagonist is appalled by what he watches, he is also intrigued and drawn in at the same time.  And this in turn drives his behaviour and the outcome of his and his family's life.  If this is true, Hollywood should rethink their current argument that movies and video games have no effect on violence in America.  (Just a little public service announcement for ya'.  Just an added extra since, well, I care.)

Perhaps not really a four, but maybe more of a 3.5.  But I'll round up today because, while I surely liked ""The Ring"" better, this was still pretty good for the genre.",1361318400,,1377,4.544715447154472

5444083,2,B00AJLHUYO,"I love supernatural thrillers, but this one disappoints.  It borrows way heavily from its predecessors - the struggling writer whose work threatens his family life, the supportive wife who eventually questions his judgment, the creepy old Super-8 films that the police haven't managed to find even though they're in plain sight in a creepy attic, the child who turns out to be scarier than you'd think - it's all there.

The ripoff Diane Arbus uncanny-kids-in-the-hallway shot is provided at no extra charge.

If you've already seen the other good supernatural thrillers, nothing in this will surprise or scare you. Even the half-heartedly-kicking legs of the hanging victims - supposed to provide a violent shock - seem improbable and unlikely. ;-)

And then there's the improbabilities of the plot, setting, and photography.  Gee, moving to a house where a murder has taken place - that's really going to be motivating for writing.  Why doesn't this guy ever turn on the lights?  Even daylight shots are dark, as though the cinematographer doesn't know how to handle light exposure. And why doesn't Deputy So-and-So have an actual name?  And why is the otherwise intelligent Ms. Rylance such a nauseating coffee-making pushover?

Our hero is adamant that he does not want to waste his great talent writing college textbooks.  About three-quarters of the way through this movie, which I diligently finished, I was hoping he'd sign a contract with Pearson Education.

The film is so cheaply made that the scenes with the requisite local-college-professor-who-happens-to-be-an-expert-on-ancient-Babylon-and-paranormal-stuff-in-general are done via computer interview.  We're supposed to think this is because our alcoholic hero is isolating, but it's just as likely that this technique was used so that the Apple product-placement that's prominent throughout the movie can be better forced on viewers.

Bennington College should probably sue these folks for appropriating one of their t-shirts.

For recent supernatural-thriller movies, I'd suggest Insidious, Two Sisters, or Apartment 143 as an alternative to this schlock.",1361318400,4,2123,5.512345679012346
5444084,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Sinister follows author Ellison (Ethan Hawke) as he moves his unsuspecting family into a new house, the home of a notorious crime, to write his new novel. Ellison eventually finds a set of  disturbing snuff films and abnormal events begin to occur. Sinister is a disturbing and unsettling ride of psychological horror.

The story in this film creepy and haunting and the horror is balanced very well; it uses elements like eerie sounds and ghostly imagery to create an unsettling atmosphere and high tension, and uses realistic violence and effective jump-scares to shock. I really enjoy the variety and balance of the horror it has, since most modern horror films rely solely on one type (usually jump-scares or gorefest); it keeps you on your feet. The film also uses found-footage like sequences when Ellison watches the snuff films; these are very disturbing and shocking, and one of these holds a jump-scare that has already jumped to the top of my favorites (I won't spoil it, though). The ending of the film was also twisted and great. The story moves at a consistent pace, usually on the slower side but I felt like it added to the suspense. Ethan Hawke gives an amazing performance, one you wouldn't expect in a horror film but one that should be expected from a great actor like Hawke. The film has a unique and superb soundtrack, as well, that positively added to the haunting atmosphere of the film; this is truly a standout OST worth listening to outside of the film.

Overall, Sinister is an exceptional horror film; it effectively uses all of the best elements of horror in a well balanced manner; and it's supported by a great lead performance, a consistent story, and an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental if you're still on the edge. Also, if you're watching for it's shocking jump-scares, avoid the trailer.

There, in the empty house he finds a box of Super 8 ""snuff films"" chronicling not only the murder of the home's previous residents but also several other grizzly mass murders.

The movie is very dark, as in hard to see kind of dark. If I was scared at night I would definitely turn on a light or two. The darkness does add atmosphere but this movie is almost always dark. Did I say it was dark? It is so dark that even in the day shots you are lucky if you can make out more than a silhouette. I literally thought something was wrong with my computer because you just cannot see more than about 25% of the screen most of the time.
Good performances and some very creepy moments. If you like the supernatural ghosts and the like, you will not be disappointed.

5444087,2,B00AJLHUYO,"'Sinister' was a massive disappointment. I should have known better. ""From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", as though that's something to market on. I hated that movie, and thought it was a massive letdown. Anyway as has always been the case I read a ton of reviews that suggested even jaded horror fans will find it truly scary and terrifying, what a load of granny's apple pie that was. Truth is the movie was average horror at best, only a little creepy here and there, even sometimes predictable, which I did not expect.

I suggest not even reading my review any further and go watch Insidious again. I can tell you that Insidious at least does manage to be truly creepy and scary at times. it can also almost get a jump out of a hardcore horror fan, but this movie doesn't even come close to being as good as Insidious, and I am truly a hardcore horror fan, and even Insidious was not as good as I had hoped. Still I did really like it though. But this movie? If you are a genuine jaded horror fan and not just one who really isn't but thinks they are, I feel pretty confident in saying you will likely sit there wondering when something is going to happen that will really knock your socks off. And while your waiting, if you saw the trailer, you'll be thinking ""Ok maybe it get's really scary when he see's what ever it was I saw in the trailer that made him jump back in terror. I bet it get's really horrifying then"". Well the truth is when that moment comes don't expect much if you truly are a real jaded horror fan because you will likely be disappointed that the moment is only a little unsettling and not much more than that.

Added to that, What was supposed to be these ghost children or what ever they were, they looked like your average kids next door in bad Halloween makeup. This was supposed to really creep you out. But it doesn't. It comes off feeling pretty silly and sometimes mildly creepy. Mostly the inclusion of the children made it seem more like a lite weight horror film for lite weight horror fans. But there were some moments that gave me a bit of a jump and a few seconds here and there where I felt a bit scared I suppose, But that's it. And the acting was excellent sometimes, but also a bit off at other times. Including Hawke who I felt didn't react enough to some stuff that would make most people s*** their pants.

The 8mm footage scenes were a bit creepy, but felt more like something you would see on one of those ION forensic TV shows, and the demon or what ever it was looked like a singer from a Norwegian black metal band. In the end there was maybe one or two mild jump scares, some pretty good music, and silly kids running around in bad Halloween makeup. Strongly advise hardcore horror fans to skip it. If you are the kind of person that thinks 'Drag me to Hell' or 'The Evil Dead' are truly disturbing scary movies, then this will really scare you. But if you think those movies are for kinder Horror fans and you want something that really will get under your skin please take my advice and skip this one.

The movie was built around a creepy atmosphere that would not let up till the very end. The usage of 8mm found footage had some of the most effect use of disturbed images that linger in your mind as you are watching them. What interested me most about the film was how the writers decided not to give away too much of who Mr. Boogie was. The twists throughout the film were great and had some originality to them. Even if there are some cliched moments in the film the overall enjoyment is taken from the intrigue into the mysterious entity known as Mr. Boogie.

first Paranormal Activity. But that's now been done to death. All horror movies now a days are either remakes or go for shock  and become what is the newer term, ""torture porn"", until now. Sinister came along just in time for all of us to get our
Halloween chills and scared the crap out of America. I have seen a lot of horror. I even go for those really bad SyFy B-rated
ones for laughs. The newer horror doesn't scare because it's predictable and instead it disgusts me. The over use of torture and gore that have nothing to do with the plot. Sinister however does something different. Ethan Hawke plays the character of a true crime writer desperate to live his glory days, almost at the cost of his family. And he plays it well. The violence that actually has to do with the plot was creatively filmed. And because the story was unique and not a rehash, the creepy atmosphere and scare wasn't predictable. Halloween 25 is predictable. Michael Myers is going after a family member. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is predicatble. Leatherface is going to kill people with a chainsaw. Saw 10 (or whatever number they are on

It's made well, builds on an average plot and has some very good acting by Ethan Hawke, without whom I don't know how long my attention span would hold out to the film. I wish the wife was a better actor and more involved in the plot, at times it feels like the protagonist was left alone.

The film's biggest strength is Ethan Hawke and it's biggest failure is the cheap make up. Also what's up with that POSTER. It is so misleading. They should have just had a house or something. I urge you to watch this film if you were a fan of films like Orphan and creaky-haunted-house-torchlight-shadow films.

After 30 odd years, you get pretty used to all the usual scare tactics and it takes a lot to really make you cringe.  I have to say that Sinister had me cringing, biting my nails and even covering my eyes in some parts.  It was original, unexpected for the most part and definitely creepy and frightening.  Ethan Hawke  gives an amazing performance as a true crime writer who finds a box of old home movies and stumbles upon a string of murders of whole families. The murders all happen in the most gruesome ways and are all recorded on super 8 film.  This is not a slasher movie.  The film of the actual murders all cut away at exactly the moment when it became gruesome but enough is shown to give you a clear idea of what is happening and honestly the imagined horror is, I think, worse, than seeing the blood and hearing the screams.  The only point where I think this movie didn't excel was toward the end.  It reverted to cheap and easy ""jump out of the shadows"" kind of scares rather than continuing with the creeping terror of the rest of the movie. That was only for about the last 15-20 minutes, though.
One scene in particular stands out to me.  It is when Ethan Hawke's character hears noises from the attic in the middle of the night and goes up to investigate.  I think I held my breath through the whole scene.
If you're up for a good scare, this is definitely worth your time.  I would caution against kids younger than 12 or 13 watching it, however, due to the subject matter and intensity of the film.",1359244800,6,1595,4.315436241610739

5444100,5,B00AJLHUYO,"As my title references, a big part of this movie that really makes it stand out is the perfect balance between giving the viewer enough information to enjoy the film, but still keeping the dark plot vague until the last possible minute. This is so important because the fear and fascination that comes with the unknown is what really drives the pressure and build up to keep you on the edge of your seat and scared as hell.

Without giving away anything that could make this movie less enjoyable, it's about a man and his family moving into a new house where the protagonist plans to write a book about the terrifying murder that happened there. But when he finds some old films of people being killed in the creepiest ways you could imagine, he unveils something more.

They do a great job with walking you through the story at the same pace as the protagonist Ellison, played amazingly by Ethan Hawke. Seeing him slowly break down, trying to balance the yearning to leave, but the importance of writing his book in order to support his family and have fame is done great. I really love that they tell you everything you would ever want to know about the back story of this... let's just say monster, for sake of spoilers, even though it is much deeper then that.

You may be turned off to this movie when you hear that you have to watch these families being murdered, thinking it's just mindless gore. But it's really not, it serves a purpose to the story and the creators did a fantastic job with showing you enough to understand what happens and feel the brutality, but at the same time not overdoing it. A very respectful way of going about it.

I think Sinister was good but not great, it had several good scary scenes, which is ultimately what I look for in horror films, and it was also very suspenseful, but ultimately it never really transcended the typical horror formula, it utilized found footage in the form of the tapes depicting the murders of the previous families, and before you discover the film's ""monster"", which is a pagan deity called Baghuul,it seems almost like a murder mystery film. Had it not been for the trailers which spoil many scenes in the movie and focus intensely on the Baghuul character I probably wouldn't have known this was even a supernatural horror film. I probably would have thought it was a crime or mystery film, albeit a dark one, but still not horror. The trailer really ruined it for me, and had me believe the film was more focused on Baghuul when in reality it focused much more on Ellison (Ethan Hawke) and his downward spiral to madness, after he knowingly moves his family into a house where the grisly murders took place. The acting was okay, and it was very scary at times, but the film was simply good, not great. Many of the scenes in the film were pointless, corny, or incredibly cliched, such as the creepy child's drawings and the eerie ghost kids. Overall decent, but nothing excellent or unique. The family was at least likeable, especially the father, so you felt bad for what happened to them at the end.",1358294400,,1536,4.6300366300366305

""Sinister"" starts out pretty much like every other haunted house film made in the last 20 years, & believe me, there was more haunted house films made, than dead people! Well, maybe that's a hair of a overstatement, but it sure seems that way. This film could be construed as ""The Amityville Horror"" influenced school of haunted housed movies, but it definitely graduated near the top of it's class.

So here we have another film in this overused & abused horror sub-genre, ho hum. Then you start to get into the movie a little more & it has a few neat little twists, as Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), the father of a young family moves into a house that nobody wants. Ok, that sounds familiar? But, the town does not want Ethan Hawke, as he is an investigative journalist/novelist that writes about true murder cases of people. His biggest success, is where he actually cracked the case of a murder, making the cops look inept, which most of them did not take to kindly to, including the head cop of the new town he moved to, telling him he should pack up & leave.

Ellison told his wife he was writing a new book, but didn't tell her the whole truth. As the house they moved into was the scene of four family members murdered, & a fifth member, a little girl is missing. Ellison is using this house to write a new book, one that will save his career, at least he thinks...then he finds an 8mm film of the family members being murdered, each one singularly, in a different manner, but not only the family from the house, but others too! A dark shadowy figure appears in these films. After watching this, strange things begin to happen to the whole family. The children have imaginary playmates. The shadowy figure appears in glimpse, & the corner of Ellison's eyes. It has an agenda, it wants the children!

""Sinister"" is a film that will crawl under your skin, moving around, making you just intrigued & uncomfortable enough to keep watching, as a feeling of impending doom starts to arise from the plot. It most definitely has a sublime creepiness that grows more potent as Ellison begins to become aware of the danger to his family, & himself, made all the more potent by fine direction, acting, & a deliberate pace of new secrets being opened up, as the lid of doom inches ever closer to shutting on the family. You are glued to the screen wondering what will transpire next, even if you think you know, there are a few good twists, that reveal their selves, in a very potent ending, that you soon won't forget!

Take the time to check this one out. It's, well, creepy.",1358294400,,2592,4.494692144373673

It is my second best horror film made in 2012.

5444106,4,B00AJLHUYO,"""Sinister"" is a little horror film that made the rounds of small theaters coincidental with its video release. I saw it yesterday in a mall theater in Grand Rapids, Mich. It's the story of an author (Ethan Hawke) who writes about grizzly murders for a living, moving himself and his family (wife plus two kids) to the whereabouts of the killings for his book research. In this film, his family has moved to the home where the murdered family lived and where the deeds occurred. And, this time, the intrepid journalist gets a lot more than he bargained for, receiving clues about the murders no one else knows from who knows where.

The production involves many typical horror film tricks -- loud noises and things that go bump in the night, ghostly visions of what may or may not be people, townspeople at odds with the principal characters because they are revisiting the murders that rocked their neighborhood, machines that turn themselves on after everyone goes to bed, the usual malcontented children, one of whom can't sleep through the night without going into something like night shock. And on and on. All the odd noises and strange goings-on happen in the dark, of course.

But a few clever plot contrivances, a marginally serpentine story that will keep you vested, and some originality save this little film from being just another exercise in horror film ho-hum. I can't tell you the best part because it would spoil the end and disclose the denouement. However, I can tell you that neither my wife nor I -- who are 65 and 62 years old, respectively, and veterans of hundreds of horror films in the theater and at home -- could guess how the film would be resolved and what would happen at the end. If neither of us can guess how a movie is going to end -- and you get a few clues in the last half-hour of ""Sinister"" -- then it is in my book an effective movie.

Be forewarned, the opening scene of ""Sinister"" is fairly grizzly in itself. Having seen the opening, I was fearful the movie would venture into X-rated territory but it did not. It is R-rated for intensity, adult content, scenes of murder, language and blood but the movie does not particularly manifest anything the average horror film maven would consider bad taste in 2012. See this in the small theater, like we did, or on your 55-inch TV and prepare yourself for a good horror story.",1357084800,2,2364,4.610451306413301
5444107,5,B00AJLHUYO,"I have seen many, many horror films in my life, and this is a top 5 standout. It's been years since I've seen a film I simply could not wait to purchase the second it came out on DVD, and Sinister is that new film. The music is something that stood out immediately as terrifying; by far the scariest soundtrack I've heard in a very long time. It adds an extra dose of fright when fright is due.
Another positive is the lighting and, to an extent, the setting. The overall look and feel is literally dark, which is fitting for the dark content of the film. The ambience as a whole was very well executed, and matched up perfectly with the plot.
The cast's performances were quite good, with Ethan Hawke being especially convincing, although the actress playing his wife did not come across well, and she gains no sympathy for her character. Even though she is continuously ""screwed over"" by her husband, you really can't feel sorry for her- all you really want is for her to stop whining. The children did very well, as did the other cast members. I love me some V D'Onofrio.
The plot is definitely my favorite aspect of the film, as it is more original than nearly any horror film I've seen. Yes, 'original' can flop, but when it doesn't, it's truly a pleasure to watch. I was on the edge of my seat during the length of the film because- and this happens VERY rarely- I honestly had no clue how it would end and I was dying to know what would happen. The storyline just hit all the marks perfectly in my opinion, and I thought it was evident that everyone who worked on this film truly collaborated in every sense of the word. It just came together like the perfect storm for me, evidenced by my ravings to all my friends and family members since I saw it opening weekend (and once more two weeks later. I would have totally gone for view number three, but my husband isn't that big on repetition, though he did love the film). I highly recommend you at least give this a watch.
Warning: there are scenes that can be disturbing in this film. There is very little blood and no gore, but there are children in not so nice situations in the movie that can definitely cause a negative reaction in sensitive viewers. However, it isn't graphic, so there are definitely worse movies as far as unpleasantries go. I myself HATE blood and guts, so I would never recommend a movie with any substantial amount of it in its content.",1356998400,6,2420,4.404017857142857
5444108,4,B00AJLHUYO,"Ethan Hawke's performance makes this movie. Otherwise, it would have never risen above the cusp of mediocrity. Sinister boasts nothing spectacular as far as plot goes: found Super 8 footage reveals a murder mystery that is up to our unlikely hero to solve. Our protagonist, however, is not a pimply punk seconds from death by pick axe nor is he a grizzled small-town cop who has had one too many bottles of Wild Turkey. He is a true crime novelist chasing his next NYT bestseller. This movie succeeds on three levels: (1) snuff footage that is gruesome enough to be original, (2) an atmospheric score, and (3) the creation of a ghost world that bows but doesn't break the fourth wall. The film falls flat in the final act, but still packs enough punch to be one hell of a ride.",1356652800,3,777,4.5177304964539005

A lot of horror films in the past that are about supernatural things but end up having a human climax is disappointing to me in most movies (cry wolf, sorority row, etc). The ending really caught me off guard, and ended in a way that makes u feel cold and creeped out. This movie makes you think. I don't know how anyone wouldn't find this film creepy, or sick to say the least and if you don't think so then something is seriously wrong with you. Amazing film!

5444112,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Scott Derrickson's ""Sinister"" is one of the most skilled and seasoned additions to the horror genre I have ever seen.  And this is after about 15 years of seeing the best material available.

Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a fairly despicable writer of true crime.  His character is a believable mix of unchecked ambition, careerism, and just a hint of a man who was once principled and wanted to give the victims he so eagerly profits off justice through the written word.  With his wife Tracy (played with a bit too much distance by Juliet Rylance) and his two children, he deliberately moves into the home where a murder he investigated took place.  The town sherrif (played well by Fred Thompson--he found his way to the set!) wants no part of him, understandably, and warns him to move before something even worse takes place.  This all sounds like cliche horror fare, but the way Derrickson films it is entirely new.  He departs from the ""puppet master"" style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious/dp/B0055D3EFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious</a>&nbsp;and only uses the ""found footage"" of the previous family's disaster to highlight the real premise of this supernatural thriller: that a certain kind of voyeurism--incidentally, what anyone who watches this must be complicit in--is itself a trait bad enough to warrant the punishment that comes, and boy, does it.  He deceptively puts the viewer at ease halfway through the film--I mistakenly thought the real promise of the film had already passed halfway through the movie--and then delivers what can only be called some masterfully cruel and unusual punishment.  The end, without using any spoilers, makes me think of a grimier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnival-of-Souls/dp/B001QI0FAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnival of Souls</a>.

I'm not sure I could watch this again, and is only for those who like the absolute hell creeped out of them.  I think the success of the film is also dependent on it's soundtrack.  To my mind, this is better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B003204MQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned film he did with James Wan.

5444113,4,B00AJLHUYO,Ok so it had quite a few scary jumpy parts but sinister wasn't terribly scary. Insidious was much scarier and put together a little bit better but don't get me wrong Sinister is still a fun movie. I've always enjoyed horror movies and every year I expect at least one to two really good ones to come out. This was one of them! Me and my wife enjoyed it very much.

5444114,3,B00AJLHUYO,Ethan Hawke does a great job of presenting a writer who is coming unhinged but the stock writing of a demonic creature trying to kill his family is poorly conceived. There are few moments of true terror and the ones that do come are at the expense of the family children which reinforces the desperate efforts at trying to elicit horror. When the moment comes and the main antagonist is revealed all I could think of was a really bad Scream mask. Wait for DVD.,1353110400,3,460,4.423529411764706
5444115,5,B00AJLHUYO,"This movie by the director of 'Exorcism of Emily Rose' is another that will be part of my library! A friend of mine and I went to see it, and even though the setup for a couple of scares he found predictable, both of us jolted several times. Plus by the end credits, he was pretty impressed, and I was left almost breathless. This is a reintroduction to horror when gore, language and sexual content wasn't required to make a good scary/horror film. If you're a modern horror fan, but like story and charecter development as well, check this out in theaters or on DVD/BR, you may never look at everyday things the same way again. Highly recommended!
Thank you, Scott D.!

I'm not going to seperate the sequel's review. It was almost as good, even with a different director and the musical score was very similar even without Christopher Young's at the keyboard. This one only has the deputy from the original, and the storyline begins sometime after the creepy events of the first one. And he seems somewhat obsessed with the Oswalt story and all the others before it. There is an estranged couple where the mother is desperately trying to protect herself and her kids( who both run across some footage videos, of course) from her physically abusive spouse. But this guy has way too much financial power, friends around every corner and a lot of arrogance, making the viewer hope he gets his... This tells the story from the kids perspective in a very creepy way, the boogeyman song from the trailer was hardly used with wouldn't have worked for me. The creature gets a lot more screen time here and the newer victim footage is a little more graphic, but not like many slasher sequels of recent decades. Those who enjoyed the original will probably want to try this one, but don't expect an exact repeat. Let's just hope this doesn't become a multi chapter franchise...",1352937600,2,1869,4.646525679758308
5444116,4,B00AJLHUYO,"This film is a watered down version of the hand held camera genre. In instances where they didn't use home video footage, they filmed the scene bad enough to make it feel like found footage. The movie opens showing us a family being hung in their back yard. True crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the same house with the intention of investigating the gruesome killing and writing about it. The locals are not warm to the idea, but we don't see any incidences due to budget constraints. Ellison doesn't inform his family they are in the same house that the killings took place.

In the attic, Ellison discovers a horde of super 8 movies (some that have their own sound track, or so it seems) of the killing he is investigating as well as other killings that date back to the 1960's. He asks the questions, ""Who is filming this?"" and ""Why?"" and ""Where is Stephanie?"" She was the daughter of the family that was hung. They never found her.

Ellison begins to investigate the other cases as weird things start to happen in the home. As usual it starts out slow and escalates.

I liked the concept of the film more than its amateurish execution. Ellison drinks rather heavily which makes for an alternate explanation of his ""hallucinations."" The film would have been better if it had lead us in that direction, rather than just discuss it. Those who enjoy the ""Paranormal"" type movies should find a friend in this film. I loved the film in the beginning, but then it slowly wanes. Thumb rule: When you think demons are in your house, turn on the lights.

5444117,2,B00AJLHUYO,"This film has a slick, polished look that differs greatly from the ""shaky cam"" or ""found film"" branch of the horror genre that likely provided its heaviest influences. It plays like an offshoot of that tradition mixed with elements of kaidan inspired Japanese horror cinema. The cast performances are all handled pretty well, although one might find a handful of scenes a bit over-acted. There are a couple of well-placed and timed shocks. However, overall I found I was increasingly bored by this film. It didn't really break any new ground or try anything very innovative. Some of the background music meant to add dark, creepy undertones was, I thought, increasingly distracting. Make-up and special effects sometimes looked like, well, make-up and special effects. I never felt much of a connection to the characters. For example, Juliet Rylance's character just seemed to appear on screen to yell and argue - albeit with good reason - but she is so poorly conceived as a character she doesn't really generate any sympathy. Ethan Hawke's character lends itself to a disparate comparison to Gregory Peck in The Omen - a driven male lead who, through his own misguided efforts, lands the family in a mess. However, where Peck drew you in and built sympathy for his character and situation, Hawke's character, similar to Rylance's, doesn't generate much sympathy. That ultimately means many viewers will stop caring what happens to him. A couple of other characters felt the same way, and two lesser roles were developed in a stereotypical manner. Hokey or stereotyped characters can work in a tongue-in-cheek film, but this movie seems to be trying very hard to be taken seriously. This adds to an overarching feeling that it all just doesn't come together very well.

I was intrigued by the relatively positive critical reviews, but ultimately found little to recommend. If you are undecided, wait for the DVD or Blu-ray release. Much of the film is very dark (too dark, in my opinion) and shot in enclosed interiors. There is nothing that benefits from viewing on the big screen. Younger viewers with little exposure to the genre's long history or those who like predictable, cookie cutter entertainment may find this film enjoyable. I could probably justify giving Sinister two and a half stars out of five, but three just doesn't seem applicable.",1351382400,,2352,5.015345268542199
5444118,4,B00AJLHUYO,"For whatever reason, there is something eerie about old home video tapes, especially when unexplained and horrible things happen to the people in them. Ethan Hawke plays a crime novelist who writes about unsolved cases and puts an extra spin on his book by actually moving to the scene of the crime. He gets in a little over his head, though, when he moves into a house in which a family was recently found hanging from the limb of a large tree.

*SPOILER ALERT* As he searches for clues as to how this family died, he stumbles onto a box of old home movies that date back 30 years, and in each video, another killing took place. Hawke discovers a connection to the occult, but becomes even more confused when a series of supernatural events start to occur within the house. He enlists the help of a local deputy to track down details about each crime, and what he discovers, of course, sets the movie up for a twist at the end. The only thing lacking in this film was the ending, given the fact that Hawke's characler seemed so intelligent and determined during the first half of the film, only to become naive and forgetful during the latter stages. The film is not gory, but it does tend to stay with you after you leave the theater.",1351209600,46,1236,4.421052631578948

Investigating several murders for his new book, he calls on two men to help him find information that he could have easily found on his Apple computer.  His biggest idiotic move is placing his family in jeopardy so he can write another best seller after a ten year dry spell, even though his family lives in a big mansion fit for a Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, as we find out near the end of the movie.

5444120,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Director Scott Derrickson's latest entry into the horror genre, the aptly titled `Sinister', is an instant classic.

Egomaniacal true-crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt, moves his wife and two kids into the house where an unsettling murder involving a family of five has recently taken place. He plans to write about the incident and the missing child, who was apparently spared and kidnapped by the killer, hoping that he can solve the mystery without the help of the local authorities.

As he stores boxes in the attic, he finds several reels of Super 8 film and a projector. Each film contains increasingly graphic and macabre footage of a family being murdered. Upon further inspection, Ellison discovers that a pale, hollow-eyed figure can be seen lurking in the background in each one of the home movies. A pattern begins to emerge, as Ellison becomes consumed with the dark secrets that lie within the films. Further investigation confirms that there are demonic forces at work, and that Ellison may have opened a gateway that has placed his family in danger.

`Sinister' takes familiar themes and situations and spins them in entirely different directions, making the film unpredictable and highly unnerving as a result. The film score by Christopher Young is almost a character in and of itself. It accentuates the disturbing nature of the film, cranking the scares all the way up to eleven. Ethan Hawke delivers an extraordinarily nuanced performance, and this ranks among some of his best work. The rest of the cast is just as good, under the direction of Scott Derrickson, who pulls absolutely no punches for the entirety of the film. Where most directors would turn away from such material, Derrickson dives right in, creating a cinematic experience that will live forever in your memory.

`Sinister' is utterly disturbing and the best horror film that I have seen all year. Not for the squeamish, that's for damn sure.

Rated R for terror and violence. 110 minutes. Directed by Scott Derrickson. Released by Summit Entertainment.",1350691200,163,2039,5.074626865671642
5444121,4,B00AJLHUYO,"I couldn't help the title, given the high visibility of the Apple products in this movie. It's far more subtly done than some of the other product placements Hollywood has done and the Macbook does actually work as part of the plot, but I can't help but poke a little fun at this fact.

Now I bet you're wondering: is this scary? Yes and no. Yes in that there were scenes where I did react, but no in that none of this is really that scary in the long run. Most viewers won't be clutching their pillows tight later on that night after seeing Sinister. A lot of the scares here are of the ""jump scare"" variety, with our supernatural bits leaping out at us from the screen. It's effective with one viewing but it's something that will lose its impact with further watching. What does work here scare-wise is that parts of this are very suitably unsettling, especially as we watch Hawke pretty much come apart at the seams. As the hauntings/supernatural bits continue, Hawke becomes more and more unhinged. As far as gore goes, don't look for it here. There is some gruesomeness via the Super 8 snuff films, but the gorier ones are fairly quickly viewed and it's really fairly light in comparison to the rest of the film. I'll warn you: most of this film does not focus on gore or jump scares. When the film is trying to be scary you have the jump scares. Otherwise the main brunt of this story is more psychological, ultimately being about the slow and possibly inevitable downfall of a guy that puts his work before his family. And I hope you like Ethan Hawke, because he carries the entire movie on his shoulders.

Part of why the film worked so well is all due to the soundtrack. The music here is excellently done. It's not the typical orchestra soundtrack you'd get with just about every other movie out there. You have a lot of scenes that are helped out by these pieces of music that are of the discordant variety, complete with ""spooky children talking"" effects. This was honestly the one part of the movie that I absolutely and completely loved. If I watch this again, it'll be to enjoy how well the soundtrack is worked into the movie and how slick it makes so much of the movie feel. It's what pushed my opinion of this film up to four stars. It's not the type of music that you could sit and listen to like you would a soundtrack such as say, the Donnie Darko soundtrack, but it's pretty enjoyable for how different it is.

I think that ultimately sums up this movie, is that it's different. Sure, the movie is ultimately one that has been told over and over again in various formats, but the creative team on this tried really hard to give it a different spin. For the most part, it works. There's a good story here and enough of the jump scares to keep most viewers entertained. We're also given enough ""inbetween"" stuff to lessen the tension, although I do think that the movie could have been tightened a little and had maybe about 10 minutes or so taken off. No more than that, though. And the ending? I rather liked it, but I can't go into why without really spoiling anything.

Overall, I can easily see this being one of those films that you'll either really like or you'll really hate. It's going to be something that'll get a cult following and is also one of those ""artsy"" horror films that tries to straddle mainstream and indie. I honestly do recommend it at least once. I'm not sure that I'd really watch it again with the same level of attention, but I can say that I enjoyed the ride.",1350691200,6,3510,4.420401854714065

The music by Christopher Young is great. The cinematography by Chris Norr is great. The film editing by Frederic Thoraval is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe & Ruth Salen is great. The production design by David Brisbin is great. The art direction by John El Manahi is great. The set decoration by Sarah Dennis & Amy Vuckovich, set dressings by Evan Seide is great. The costume design by Abby O'Sullivan is great. The visual effects supervised by Jason Piccioni & coordinated by Diane Macke is great. The stunts coordinated by Rob King, Manny Siverio & Trampas Thompson is great.

This is a great and well-made (also well-crafted & well-acted) horror film that is entertaining. This is another hit from the producer of ""Paranormal Activity"" & ""Insidious"". Interestingly enough, this could be a great double horror movie feature this year, right next to the fourth ""Paranormal Activity"", which is coming out on Friday (early Thursday showings, as well), of course. This is also one of the best films of the fall season and one of the best horror movies of the year. It is also one of the best original horror movies in recent memory.",1350172800,3,1551,4.845283018867924
5444123,3,B00AJLHUYO,"It's competently made, with incredibly unsettling music by Christopher Young, but I can't see myself ever watching this movie more than once. I'm not particularly scared of ghost children, and there wasn't enough of the Ghoul (the main selling point in the advertisements). I'm glad the movie doesn't completely rely on cheap jump-scares, and actually builds creepy tension throughout, but the surprise ending sorta ruined the whole movie for me.",1350172800,,446,5.385714285714286
5444124,1,B00AJLHUYO,"When I first seen the trailer for Sinister I had high hopes, after seeing this non-scary movie I was disappointed. The movie was long and pointless with no gore and no nudity can't understand how it got a R-rating it should have gotten a PG instead. A boogieman makes kids kill their family then boogieman takes that kid in the end, and you don't really see the boogieman. A couple years back horror movie were gory, action, and nudity such as: Dawn of the dead remake, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Texas the Beginning, Rob Zombie's films all were good and gory, Friday the 13th remake, Slithers etc. plus we can't forget the classics from the 80's. Sinister is not scary, it sucked! I hope we start seeing better horror movies and not pointless boogieman crap!",1350172800,2,764,4.666666666666667
8552675,5,B00AJLHUYO,"Definitely enjoyed this, and I'm a little glad I didn't see it in the theater. The premise is not super creative, but it combines a solid mix of psychological with supernatural horror.  I'm not adding anything really, but let me reiterate that the Super 8 footage is really disturbing, especially as it gets repeated throughout the movie in different contexts.  Combining classic horror storytelling with the overdone found footage technique brought something truly unique to the genre by having the found footage be silent. Sounds small, but you'll see when you when you watch. Yes, a couple of cheesy jump scares, but they were actually welcome as there is no humor to lighten the relentlessly creepy vibe. Deputy so and so may have elicited a smile or two with an audience, but in the privacy of my own apartment (within an old, converted, quasi-creepy at night house,) I was not amused. If you liked The Ring, The Grudge, and the first Paranormal Activity, this is probably right up your alley. My boyfriend fell asleep during it, but he doesn't get horror. So looks like I'm sleeping with the light on.",1530662400,,1107,4.821052631578947

8552680,3,B00AJLHUYO,"Ultimately a good premise, too much clichd material, poorly edited and so forth.  Long walks down dark hallways, again and again.  Main character is in a dark hallway, literally standing next to a light switch.  Does he turn it on?  No.  Does he ever wake up his wife about a possible intruder in his hourse?  No.  He would rather walk through the dark house, alone, again and again.  Movie was almost two hours long.  Could have 15 minutes shorter and no dark hallways. Then it would probably be 5 stars",1526515200,,504,4.511111111111111
