2874716,5,B000RPOCJ8,"I got this the first day it came out. Because I was such a big Goosebumps fan I bought it. This was not as good as Night of the living dummy III. Well, you know it's weird, in the book of Night of the living dummy II, Slappy hits his head on a steel thing and gets his head cracked in two. And in Night of the living dummy II the episode, he falls on the edge of the fire place and toatally destroys his head. In Night of the living dummy III the book he gets his limbs torn off by the other dummies. While in the episode, he gets struck by lighting and blows up. Otherwise, they were still good Goosebumps episodes, I don't want to get started on Bride of the living dummy. oh well, Night of the living dummy II was a good use of a Slappy puppets. On Night of the living dummy III sometimes they used migets in costumes. Well, that;s it.",1193788800,5,838,3.994047619047619

2874722,5,B000RPOCJ8,"I love the night of the living dummy series in the Goosebumps TV episodes. There are two episodes featuring Slappy on this DVD. In ""Night of the Living Dummy II"", Amy Kramer gets a ventriloquist dummy named Slappy in place of her old dummy, Dennis. But as soon as Amy reads the strange card in his pocket, strange things begin to happen that only the dummy could be doing.  In ""Bride of the Living Dummy"", Jillian Zinman is annoyed by her little sister's doll, Mary Ellen. But when Jillian goes to a ventriloquist show starring Jimmy O'James and his dummy Slappy, Jillian meets Jimmy and one day Slappy shows up in a box addressed to her. Then strange things start happening. These episodes are a great addition to my Goosebumps collection.",1453766400,,740,4.648854961832061

2874729,5,B000RPOCJ8,"I've seen many reviews saying that kids love this show, but adults can love it. I'm one of them. No, this show doesn't scare me. However, it is a lot of fun and entertaining. The two episodes on this DVD amount to 44 minutes, and those minutes flew by. Night of the Living Dummy II and Bride of the Living Dummy are like G-rated versions of the Child's Play series, only they won't take up as much of your time.",1437955200,2,411,4.15
2874730,4,B000RPOCJ8,Bought this for a good movie for kids to watch. This is a great series of movies for children to watch and give them a scare on their level without being too scary. Great for Halloween time or for slumber parties.,1435536000,2,213,4.219512195121951

2874739,4,B000RPOCJ8,"My 6 year old got this movie for his birthday. I like that it has two episodes on it instead of one. The episodes are Night of the Living Dummy II and The Bride of the Living Dummy. The only reason I gave it a four star is because it says night of the Living Dummy like it's the first one, but it is not. It is the second one. My son also has the third one, but we cannot find the first one. I was hoping when I bought it that it would be the first, but just like everyone else said it is not.",1410998400,2,493,3.660377358490566
2874740,5,B000RPOCJ8,"A true DVD you must own if you are an RL STEIN fan, and a ""Slappy"" fan too.  Get the whole collection of the Night of the Living Dummy video collection. It is worth it.",1397088000,2,168,3.8
2874741,5,B000RPOCJ8,"My daughter adores this movie BUT I must warn it is NOT Night of the Living Dummy!!! It's Night of the Living Dummy 2 and Bride of the Living Dummy, a double feature but excluding the first in the series.",1395014400,9,204,4.125
2874742,1,B000RPOCJ8,"It clearly says ""Night of the Living Dummy"" but it actually is Night of the Living Dummy 2 which is a completely different story. They need to change the title.",1394064000,7,160,4.366666666666666

2874745,5,B000RPOCJ8,"The grandkids love the Night of the Living Dummy movies. I think they are fascintated by the way the dummies move around. Good entertainment, but not too scary.",1351555200,2,160,4.75
2874746,4,B000RPOCJ8,"If you wonder where Night of the Living Dummy is, well it was never adapted into an episode, probably because of Slappy not being in it.

In Night of the Living Dummy II, Amy Kramer's ventriloquist dummy's head keeps popping off and her Dad brings her a new dummy from a second-hand store. The dummy is called Slappy! Suddenly, a series of accidents occur and Amy's parents blame her, when actually Slappy is responsible.

In Bride of the Living Dead, Jimmy O' James and his ventriloquist dummy named Slappy, is playing gigs here and there to make money. One night Slappy falls in love with a doll that belongs to a young girl named Mary-Ellen. Slappy literally sends himself in the mail to the girl's house so he can be with the doll.

I'm a big Slappy fan. The episodes are fun, but they don't do the books justice, thanks to the short running time.

If you like this DVD, you should try Goosebumps -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goosebumps-Night-of-the-Living-Dummy-III/dp/B0002IQLEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goosebumps - Night of the Living Dummy III</a>.",1346371200,7,1107,5.308571428571429
