8394562,2,B003CWEQ9Y,I considered the recording of poor quality. The fidelity was a long way from the blu Ray recordings that I have been getting.  I would dearly love to find a good recording of Petrushka on Blu Ray.  Does one exist?  I realized when I bought this that it would not be of the best but I hoped for better.,1361664000,7,301,4.067796610169491
8394563,2,B003CWEQ9Y,"These performances from around 1990 are interesting from an artistic point of view, particularly the Rite of Spring.  However these are taken from television broadcasts and the video and audio quality are very poor.  Probably they duplicate the experience of watching the performance on a Soviet-made television.  Sound is also quite poor.",1272499200,47,339,5.480769230769231
