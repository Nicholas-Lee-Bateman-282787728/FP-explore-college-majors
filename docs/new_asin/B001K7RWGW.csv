8314419,5,B001K7RWGW,Great in so many ways and a good counterpoint to classic Hollywood thrillers. It just keeps going in directions you'd never anticipate. Please watch this film if you are a fan of psycho-thrillers.,1339545600,,196,4.96969696969697

I never though I would have to look for the region code when the text on the cover is in english . well you live you learn.",1282089600,2,246,3.843137254901961
8314421,5,B001K7RWGW,"An award winning and financially successful thriller, based on a the case of Yoo Young Cheol, a serial killer operating in contemporary Seoul, who was finally arrested in 2004 after killing dozens of elderly christian couples and prostitutes, not by the cops, but by a determined pimp who noticed that his call girls disappeared after he'd set them up with a client that always called from the same cel phone number.  (For details on the real life case, see [..]"" - horrific as the film is, I was stunned to learn that the real life perpetrator was even worse than he is shown to be in the film. )

An out of competition selection at Cannes, ""The Chaser"" is noted for upending genre expectations in interesting ways, not the least of which is by telling the story from the viewpoint of an utterly unsympathetic  former police detective, Jung-Ho (Kim Yoon Suk in a career-making role) who was drummed out of the force for corruption, and descended to extortion, and pimping, to get by.  This protagonist's selfish motivations, and tendency towards violence, is effectively complemented by the depiction of the police, whose politicking, laziness, incompetence and outright stupidity, both allowed the serial killer Young-min (a chilling Ha Jung-woo), a known rapist and violent, if highly intelligent and methodical, career felon (in real life as well as the film) to continue his rampage unchecked for years, virtually forcing the pimp to play a heroic role against all his frankly criminal instincts.  [Special mention is also due Seo Young-hee in the role of a single mother and prostitute, Mi-Jin, and the young actress who plays her percocious six year old daughter]. The film, which features charged violent and bloody set pieces, bleakly comic scenes explicating the sheer incompetence of the police department, and lots of effective melodrama, garnered so much positive notice in international film markets that Warner Brothers quickly bought the remake rights and has thus far, secured the services of the star and screenwriter of ""The Departed"" (itself an adaptation of the Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"") Leonardo DeCaprio, and William Monahan (and is seeking the participation of ""Departed"" director Martin Scorsese) to transplant the story for the American market.  (Scorsese is reportedly trying to figure out how to fit the film into his schedule.)

I'm happy to say I can recommend the film, which kicks off with a horrific bang after a low key intro to pimp Jung Ho's lowlife mileu, and continues on to build suspense through a series of red herrings, twists, turns and outbreaks of violence, to a pretty powerful, if fatalistic, ending.  That said it is a bit overlong, with slow sequence of scenes in the middle of the film, that I suspect were intended to convey the frustrations of divining the intentions of an unknowable adversary, but might drive some viewers, primed for a racing storyline, to distraction.  Potential viewers should ask themselves if they found the slow bits in other fact-based films about the hunt for a serial killer, like Korea's ""Memories of Murder"" or the thematically very similar recent American film, ""Zodiac,"", a problem.  If not, definitely give ""The Chaser,"" a try.  The acting, cinematography and editing are uniformly strong, Korea being the one country in East Asia whose live action production standards match those of the United States.",1239494400,9,3402,5.100719424460432
