8513159,4,B007A36ZNQ,"Not a 5 star just because it's primarily a documentary and by definition it will be a challenge to hold the interest of my religious ed students, but after I teach that particular class, this 30 minute documentary brings it together for one more affirmation.",1397260800,,258,4.7555555555555555

8513161,5,B007A36ZNQ,"I showed this video in my CCD class. It is excellent and clearly defines what the church teaches on the final four and why these truths matter in our lives. It's only about half an hour long so it left plenty of time to have a discussion over it. It was mostly the priests talking, not a whole lot of imagery, but what they had to say kept the whole class engaged. I teach high school seniors and they really got into it. It helped them to better understand Death, Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory. They had good questions and discussion especially on how we can't possibly conceive the joy and peace promised in Heaven. I could tell it made them think about life and death and important matters we take for grant it.",1386547200,,712,4.360902255639098

8513163,5,B007A36ZNQ,"I must say that I have become a great fan of Fr. Marcus Holden and Fr. Andrew Pinsent who co-currently run a programme (if I'm not mistaken) for re-educating Catholics and for re-evangelizing called 'EVANGELIUM' in the UK. Their approach is simple, straight forward, yet in no way watered down. You get the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God!
In this short DVD presentation, we have, quite simply, the Christian catholic explanation of  death and the hereafter which may be heaven, purgatory or hell, depending on the choices we make, which the Fathers cannot put enough emphasis upon. These priests as well as Fr. Jeremy Davies and Fr. Beruz Rafat, takes the viewer, be he/she a new catholic, a lapsed one or devout, in a very eloquent, gentle yet ironically, a stern journey through the last things. The programme is dramatic in the context of exquisite artwork and wonderful music, which enhances the message that these wonderful priests have for us.
It should be watched seriously by everyone. It places a whole new dimension on one's faith. The cafeteria Catholic will NOT enjoy this, ALL THE MORE REASON FOR THEM TO WATCH IT! The devout Catholic will learn that there still exists much room for improvement, and for the lapsed....well....the message is that there is a whole huge world that they need to know about before time runs out or they will be taken quite by surprise!!!!

An excellent aid to catechesis, especially in this Year of Faith, and for all times.
A must have for EVERY home and parish.

Running time : 32 minutes in English with no subtitles.
