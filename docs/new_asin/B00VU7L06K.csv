8711281,5,B00VU7L06K,"I loved the original trilogy and miss Noah Wyle in this series, as he adds a great deal to the interest. This series does not do as well as the trilogy, but it is very much a Doctor Who type of program and if you like the Doctor, you may like this series. I asked for a region free blu-ray player for Christmas and my husband upped that by buying one that was also a 3D player as well. So this is already ordered but from amazon uk - not a German import. I have found that amazon uk is often cheaper, even with the exchange of pounds to dollars and shipping. Sometimes I am amazed at how fast the order comes and sometimes it can take 3 weeks. Their packaging is usually excellent and if you have a problem, you e-mail them and the customer service is just as good. But the biggest advantage is that  they have many  movies  in blu-ray long before we do and some of them in region free editions which do play in region 1 players I have had a blu-ray Aladdin (region free) for years. Another example, the David Tennant Doctor Who series is in blu-ray in the uk, but not here. So I comparison shop before I buy and if I added it up, I think I would find that I've already saved enough to have paid for our new player.",1454716800,5,1215,4.075313807531381
8711282,1,B00VU7L06K,What good is this?  We need the US version what idiot is in charge of distribution should be fired. This is a wonderful program in so many ways and these idiots leave the US out.,1453075200,,178,4.085714285714285
8711283,5,B00VU7L06K,I love this series. Why is it only in region 2.,1451260800,8,47,3.3636363636363638
8711284,1,B00VU7L06K,5 Stars for the series.  Less than 1 star for Region 2 format.  Where and when will we see Region 1 DVD?,1451174400,2,104,3.6818181818181817
8711285,5,B00VU7L06K,"Great  series,  we need it on blu ray for the USA!",1451088000,13,50,3.4545454545454546
8711286,1,B00VU7L06K,"Agree with another reviewer.  Five star show,  but ridiculous that we can't get it is the US.  Similar premise as Warehouse 13, which was also a great show.  The characters are developing nicely and becoming more cohesive in season 2.  I like that Noah Wiley still appears.",1450483200,14,273,4.723404255319149
8711287,1,B00VU7L06K,This is a great series. Why oh why can't we get a version of this here in the United States? Five stars for the series itself. One star for the format.,1450310400,13,151,3.903225806451613
