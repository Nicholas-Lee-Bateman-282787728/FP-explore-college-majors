5340479,5,B009INAHZS,I saw this on tv not to long ago and right away looked ta see if it was on dvd but it wasn't. I see it's coming out on dvd now good news. I like John Dehner in this movie also he plays a good role no matter if he plays the good guy or the bad guy. If ya like westerns at all you need this for your collection you won't be sorry and Audie always done a great job in westerns.,1350172800,36,374,3.5180722891566263

5340504,5,B009INAHZS,"Three different Audie Murphy characters in this movie, and he plays them all really well.  At first, he's a bit of a derelict who drinks too much and has no apparent work ethic.  I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't get into the other people he morphs into, but this one is worth watching.  I wish the wrap-up segment of the movie would have been longer (I think it ends a bit abruptly).  All in all, another terrific Audie Murphy western.",1448323200,6,449,4.247058823529412

5340508,1,B009INAHZS,"I love a good Western and love the B-Westerns the best. Audie Murphy is my favorite B-Western actor. I love 99% of his Westerns. Now that Ive stated my stance on Westerns, this has got to be the worst Audie Murphy Western ever. This was the 1% that did not make the cut.  While the transfer quality was good and clear and it being in B&W was no loss there are a few issues which left me bothered?
Here is what made this a train wreck.  As reviewer William W. Miller stated in his review its Red River like which was not a bad thing, but the ending here just makes you ..For a lack of better words PISSED OFF. The whole movie basically has Audie ticked off at everyone and he pushes them too and over the limit for no real reasons. He almost never said thank you for your help or acknowledges people for anything. That became real tired after the first 15 times it happened within the first 20 min of the movie.  This over the top arrogance and almost bad guy mentality to me left the movie without a real purpose of where it wanted to go.  This is more than evident by the half a$$ ending we were given.  Again to quote the review by William W. Miller; Two of the four bad guys shoot each other, while the other two just rides away. They never got to Audie or even challenged him. No gun fight or anything between the bad guys and him. There was no dialog between the Chip (the father) and Audie to explain anything more than he happened to be his father The whole thing about his upbringing was never really clear and was left to the views to fill in some of the less than obvious background and plot holes. The action was minimal(No real gun play  and a few fist fights) and the story dragged on to the extent that I was bored and almost wanted to see Audie killed off before it ended.  I would not recommend this film as a Western nor as even an ok Audie movie.",1436745600,,1864,4.146814404432133

5340558,3,B009INAHZS,"Hi Folks,
This is a good but not great Audie Murphy film. It is not so much Audie's acting but rather the story line that I find less attractive than many other of Audie's films like ""No Name on the Bullet' and ""Sierra"". This is a personal preference like some people prefer a cola beverage to a lemon/lime soda or root beer. You might enjoy this film and call it great but not so much for me. I am not going into the story line at this point. If you are a true Audie Murphy fan you will enjoy this film but like in my case it simply is to what degree.
Hope this helps.
Blessings,

5340564,3,B009INAHZS,"I am an Audie Murphy fan. Grew up with his movies and while not the best actor ever, always seemed to put forth a good effort and provided an appealing character. And that holds true in this picture as well. A man on a mission, pushing those with him to their limit on a cattle drive (hence my reference to Howard Hawks' Red River). It's in black and white, which I can live with. Many good westerns were in black and white, the aforementioned Red River, High Noon, and 3:10 to Yuma to mention just a few. But the conclusion of this film happens in about two minutes and doesn't live up to the care taken to tell the story to that point. Two of the four bad guys shoot each other, while the other two just ride away, and Audie's character saves his father from a cattle stampede, this father with whom he was in a physical altercation with just moments before as a result of learning that this individual was, in fact, his father, right before the stampede began. We then cut to Audie and his herd arriving in Santa Fe, his attitude much improved, having arrived in time to pay off the bank note on the ranch, and presumably resolving lingering issues with his father, THE END. The wrap up of the movie just seemed like some meat had been cut out of it. Otherwise, it was an entertaining and even interesting film up to that point.",1366416000,6,1331,4.328

5340575,5,B009INAHZS,"This Timeless Media Group release (January, 2013) of CAST A LONG SHADOW arrived this weekend, and, although I haven't had the time to watch the entire film yet, I did perform a spot check, and from what I see the quality is fine. Timeless have licensed this lesser-known Murphy oater from Twentieth-Century Fox and MGM. United Artists (now part of MGM) originally released the film in 1959.

Among some Western writers and biographers of Audie Murphy this film is often overlooked and criticized, but I believe they underrate the film. Certainly, Audie Murphy's Westerns with Universal-International, including NO NAME ON THE BULLET, SEVEN WAYS FROM SUNDOWN, and RIDE CLEAR OF DIABLO, are better films, shot in Technicolor and with high production values.  But Murphy is never less than solid and believable in this one. Additionally, he gets able co-starring cast support from John Dehner, James Best, and Denver Pyle. The Mirisch Company produced the film, and, unlike what some film guides indicate, it was shot in black and white (faithfully reproduced here). The veteran Thomas Carr directed.

Lastly, the price is right--one cannot argue with that. Murphy fans should not hesitate to snatch this one up.",1359849600,23,1209,5.158163265306122

5340578,5,B009INAHZS,"Here's an AUDIE MURPHY western classic that should be out on dvd by now. It is on foreign dvd but not American. Gosh..How do they rate. Murphy goes after bad guys who shot his friend the sheriff & abducted a local girl. The plot reminiscent of HIGH NOON,the posse of town blowhards gradually abandons Murphy;only tenderfoot banker (JohnSaxon)remains to prove his manhood. A great classic lost. The leader of the bad guys is the great...VIC MORROW along with""Angel Eyes""LEE VAN CLEEF.
It's in COLOR TOO. So come on AMERICA.....RELEASE IT!!!! THE FOREIGNERS have it on dvd...and it's not even their movie. Thank you  J.R.",1357516800,11,619,4.951923076923077
5340579,5,B009INAHZS,"Audie Murphy was irrate that this film was not in color and I can see his point. It's a solid Western from an era when color had become the norm in order to compete with television. And Top-Notch it is with excellent acting and direction from the likes of low-budget master Thomas Carr. This is a pretty slick A- Western with lots to like, just too bad, no color. Highly recommended for fans of quality Westerns & Audie Murphy.",1355616000,64,427,4.417721518987341
