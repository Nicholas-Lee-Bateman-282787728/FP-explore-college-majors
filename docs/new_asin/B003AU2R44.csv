8393212,2,B003AU2R44,"I was stunned to find that this was merely a copy taken off the tv from tcm.com.  I do believe this should have been noted in the advertisement.  I can do that myself.  I expected a professional, fully licensed copy.  Had I been forewarned, I'm not sure I would have concluded the sale.  Again, I can frankly do better than this myself.  Sorry",1394064000,8,343,4.365079365079365
8393213,3,B003AU2R44,Well the dvd i ordered came in a timely manner. However it arrived without a wrapper which I wasn't expecting since it says it is new. I ordered it for a gift and Couldnt decide li I wanted to go through the hassle of returning it. I wanted to watch it to make sure it was ok but didn't have time. I shipped it to my Grandma hoping its scratch free and of good quality.,1363305600,4,369,3.933333333333333
8393214,5,B003AU2R44,This is a great movie which stars Olivia in her prime.  She is captivating in the role and so is Charles.  They just do not make them like they used to.,1360540800,6,152,3.870967741935484
8393215,4,B003AU2R44,"One reviewer above has this as a one star movie and then wrote a 5 star review.  This is a really good film with Boyer as the womanizer set on getting into America and De Havilland as the impressionable young teacher he lures.  The movie covers the evolution of their relationship from manipulation to something more.  Boyer is very good and DeHalliland plays the duped romantic beautifully.  Not sure what kind of copy you are getting here so it is tough to review the product, but the film is very good.",1359158400,8,505,4.516483516483516
8393216,5,B003AU2R44,"Charles Boyer, Olivia de Havilland and Paulette Goddard deserve high praise for their performances in this poignant and touching slice of Americana from Mitchell Leisen (who later directed de Havilland in 'To Each His Own'). Basically the story of a European gigolo (Boyer) who wants to get into the United States without a long wait in Mexico. His girlfriend and ex-dancing partner (Paulette Goddard) convinces him to marry an unsuspecting American schoolteacher (de Havilland)in order to gain fast entry before ditching her. Colorful supporting characters come to life--most notably Walter Abel as an immigration officer and Rosemary de Camp as a pregnant woman who wants her child born in the U.S. Boyer narrates the story to a film director (Mitchell Leisen) and we see the story unfold in flashback from his point of view. Excellent work by all concerned. My only complaint is the abrupt ending--which I understand was a result of trouble with Boyer who wanted certain scenes rewritten--a final scene between him and de Havilland would have been preferable to what seems like a letdown for the finale. As it is, it looks like choppy editing before ""The End"" flashes on the screen. Still, a romantic drama with an abundant amount of dry humor and some crackling dialogue by Paulette Goddard who sparkles in her role as ""the other woman"". Her confrontation scene with the schoolteacher is one of the highlights of the film. De Havilland was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this, but lost to her sister, Joan Fontaine, for 'Suspicion'.  (Neil Doyle)",1329091200,12,1558,5.038759689922481
8393217,1,B003AU2R44,"Waited a long while to get this movie, it is very old with 2 of my favorite actors. I love old movies, but it is very difficult to find them. The above title has been on my bought a while back. Some old movies are entered as having a few copies available. I order them hoping that they will be sent to me asap. When I received this movie, I put all other ones aside and watched it, still brings tears to my eyes, which is what I love about old movies, they can make you cry and they can make you laugh. The younger generation think they are corny, not so, they have passion, the men and women respected each other back then. Sex was not the all important thing then, not as flagrant as in today's movies, very discreet, the violence was not as graphic, no special animation, everything was real. Sometimes they tried for special decor or action, but most of it was a bit corny and funny, and I loved it. Soon they will not need actors, special animation can make the ""actors"" do whatever the directors wants to, the more gory, the better. I haven't been to a theatre to see a movie in over 4 years, and the way it's going, I'll never be back to see the kind of crapola that is shown on their screen.
This is what I have to say
