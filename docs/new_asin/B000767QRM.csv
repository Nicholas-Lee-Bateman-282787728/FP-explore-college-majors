The dvd isn't exactly loaded with extra features. I recommend looking up the series, and making sure you really are interested before buying, but i would highly recommend it. ^_^",1109548800,6,318,4.8

If you want a good laugh and a good story that only lasts for 4 episodes, check out Kekko Kamen.  You will love it! Kim",1290038400,,264,4.019230769230769
8044791,2,B000767QRM,"Let me start out by saying I LOVE GO NAGAI! I can't believe this anime came from the same guy that created Demon Lord Dante, Devil Man, and Black Lion as well as other classics of anime. As much as it hurts me to say this, Kekko Kamen is bad. To say that the animation is sub-standard is being very nice. Then there's the story. I'm going to cry. Please don't hate me Go Nagai (and please don't ever do this to your loyal fans again).",1227571200,,434,4.058139534883721
8044792,4,B000767QRM,"That Go Nagai!  His creations of anime characters such as ""Cutey Honey"", ""Devilman"" and many other popular titles have won many anime fans hearts but way back in 1991, ""Kekko Kamen"" was an anime that I never saw coming.

  During those old school anime days, Go Nagai has been known as one of the great human treasures of Japanese manga and of the anime industry.

  Nagai has been credited for both modern horror comics/anime and the invention of the mecha genre but Nagai and perverted anime?  It's just something that I couldn't fathom.  Could it be possible?

  So, when rumors started swirling around that Go Nagai has an animation featuring a nude female superhero with a unique special move. I heard it was hentai but also unlike hentai that was out at the time (usually it was ""Urotsukidoji"" or ""Cream Lemon"" related).  No sex scenes but nudity and loads of perverted humor.

  When ""Kekko Kamen""finally came out in the U.S., I couldn't wait to check it out!

  The storyline of ""Kekko Kamen"" revolves around an interesting school known as ""Big Toenail of Satan's Spartan Instituteof Higher Education"" ran by the perverted, masked principal and a lecherous teacher who enjoys punishing the students (and always wearing a surgical mask).

  The first OAV is about disciplining those who don't do well in their tests and unfortunately for sleepy student Takahashi Mayumi, she accidentally is caught sleeping and she has to be punished.

  Who to punish Mayumi is the much feared Nazi dominatrix.

  As Mayumi is chained up and her clothes being whipped off her, who is to save her but a masked, nude and well-endowed superhero named Kekko Kamen.  Multi-talented with  great fighting skills and special moves such as ""Muff-ication"", Kekko Kamen fights for justice, freedom and the naked truth.

  And in the first OAV, Kekko Kamen uses S&M techniques to overpower the Nazi dominatrix to save Ms. Takahashi.

  And in the next three episodes, Mayumi will continue to get kidnapped (and removed of her clothing) by the principal and the teacher as they try to find ways  to capture and defeat Kekko Kamen.

  ""Kekko Kamen"" was definitely one of the few anime at the time to start the perverted hentaish (without the sex) that we see right now but the anime was so over the top that the storyline and characters have not been duplicated.

  OAV 2 features Kekko Kamen vs. a gym coach, OAV 3 features Kekko Kamen vs. an exchanged student armed with tentacles (what perverted anime can not have tentacles) and OAV 4 features Kekko Kamen vs. a perverted picture-taking samurai who just can't stop taking naughty photos of the girls on campus.

  It's been well over a decade since I watched ""Kekko Kamen"" and watching it today, still works.

  I guess perverted humor hardly gets old but I couldn't help but laugh because this anime is so over-the-top and perverted.

  Unfortunately there are only 4 OAV's but for those who want more, you can also find the original manga published by Shueisha and also the ""Kekko Kamen"" live movies.

  As for the animation, since this is old school anime, don't expect something super.

  The anime features the English and Japanese vocal track in 2.0 and for special features, original character sketches are included.

  There's no way I can knock ""Kekko Kamen"" because it's so entertaining.

  No matter how old the anime is, it still doesn't disappoint.  I can't describe how zany, fun and perverted this anime is but I definitely can recommend checking this DVD out.",1218585600,7,3506,4.8438030560271645
8044793,5,B000767QRM,Wonderful and funny and silly and perverted and shocking in many ways. Loads of fun for teachers and Nazis.,1217894400,,107,4.684210526315789
8044794,5,B000767QRM,"I first learned about Kekko Kamen back when it came out in '92 and searched everywhere for it but finally found it early this year. I expected it to be funny and wasn't disappointed. The plot isn't outstanding, but was never meant to be. In a school filled with girl-punishing teachers, one idiot stands above the rest. No matter what she does she ends up failing and beign tortured and needs to be rescued by the masked wonder Kekko Kamen.

The anime actually didn't get too boring with the situations the girl got into so it was actually interesting from episode to episode. And, surprisingly enough, the english dubbed version of the anime wasn't horrid. The dvd doesn't have many, if any, special features worth talkign about but is really it's only downside.

So, if you love barely concealed lesbian plotlines and nude women beating the crap out of people with nunchaku and her super Open Leg Jump, this anime is for you. If you're looking for plain hentai, this isn't for you. Otherwise get this anime and prepare to laugh your ass off.",1124841600,10,1043,4.663043478260869
