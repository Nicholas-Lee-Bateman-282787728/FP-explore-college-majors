They  refunded  my  money.  Than  i  decided  to  order  this  tripack  from  amazon...  and  it  still  to  be  the  same  problem,  no  exercise ...  What  is  going  on ???  The  tripack  made  in  China,  probably  they  produced  bad  product... i  will  send  it  back  and  ask  for  a  refund,  didn't  do  it  b'cause  caught  a  cold  and  still  recover  from  it...
 The  fun  challenge  tripack  works  perfect !  The  others  2  tripacks  i  ordered  from  Wai  Lana  work  perfect,  just  this  one  is  bad...",1426118400,,830,4.378787878787879
8367958,5,B002EOVX7Y,"I have Wai Lana's tripack, Easy Series dvd's and use them all the time. These are equally as good. (I should say excellent) Anyone who likes Wai Lana's style is sure to love this set.",1424995200,,183,4.257142857142857
8367959,5,B002EOVX7Y,"Wai Lana explains clearly the poses in 3 different series in this DVD: Flexibility, Stamina and Strengthening.

I felt very comfortable to start with the poses in the flexibility series as a beginner to Yoga. My body was very stiff, but I tried to practice these poses in a very relaxed way as per her instruction and now I feel very flexible. Practice of these poses simply loosens and tones all my body parts and I feel refreshed for the long day ahead. I had a very bad posture at work and that caused many problems like: Neck tension, Back pain, stiff joints etc. Now I could feel practice of these poses improved my posture and gives relief from different kind of pain. It is very easy to understand and to practice the poses correctly as she explains it very slowly in a clear and sweet voice.  I would suggest anyone having the problems like: sciatica, blood pressure, digestion problem etc. can get relief by practicing the poses in this series.

After practicing the poses in the flexibility series, it became easy for me to start with the strength building poses. Initially it was bit difficult to balance with these poses but gradually with practice it increased balance and strength in the body. I feel very refreshed doing these poses as this helps massaging different body parts and increases blood circulation. I didn't know that yoga pose can help calming the mind, but there are few poses in this series which really helps to relieve stress, anger and anxiety. Wailanas yoga poses not only helps me in building the stamina but helps in being alert, aware and to think more clearly. Practicing these poses, I could realise how proper breathing helps in energizing the body.

I was having a severe body Pain, hand tremor with sciatica and different health issues mainly due to the toxins in my body and Bad Posture. With the practice of different poses in the Stamina Series I am getting relieved from the pains gradually and feeling better now.
Practicing the Exhilarating Breath Pose I could feel the toxins are coming out slowly with an extra benefit of toning my Abdomen. Many poses in this series helps me relieve Back pain, to have a strong back and a good posture allowing me to spend a happy day. Few poses helps me in stretching and strengthening different body parts helping to get balance and concentration. Doing the cobbler pose I could feel relaxed from the Sciatica pain. These poses are a real help for me to get relief from different pains and getting stamina in different body parts.

The way she explains the samadhi pose is totally different from all other methods of samadhi I knew till now. I feel very relaxed doing it as this releases all the tension from different body parts and the entire body rests peacefully.
When I heard the yoga sound from her lips, I could realise the beauty of this sound is manifold in comparison to the scenic beauty of the videos. The yoga sound is very relaxing and makes the mind restful and focused. It simply releases all the tension and anxiety. Her smiling face and expression, dance with her makes my day.",1407974400,,3081,4.666666666666667
8367960,5,B002EOVX7Y,"If you want to do some simple, yet challenging yoga, this DVD pack is great. There's 3 DVDs with one work out each. They programs run about 55 minutes, but each ends with 5 or 10 minutes of meditation so the work outs are slightly shorter.

This isn't like the recent extreme yoga you'll find where you might injure yourself moving too quickly or pushing your body too hard. You'll get into the pose and hold it. Wai Lana will then instruct you as you hold it on how to improve your posture and how to breath. You will enter the position gently and get out of it gently.

This is not a 'flow' yoga so you will enter and leave each position on its own. She gives you a moment to rest after more challenging positions. She also instructs you to use the video to practice on your own, if you can hold the poses longer.

Each DVD comes with a full color booklet of the routines, so you can practice without the DVDs.

The most helpful thing about this program is that it has you doing classic yoga poses that may seem simple until you really challenge yourself to hold them, and she also has some arm balance preparation poses.

Note: You WILL need a wall to do some of these poses.",1389571200,8,1178,4.241071428571429
8367961,5,B002EOVX7Y,"Wai Lana is old school, she is one of the few instructors left who does not teach in the new ""flow or vinyasa"" style. This is one of the only DVD's you can buy which does not focus on repetitive Sun Salutations aka ""flows"".  Not that there is anything wrong with those. But these DVD's are a welcome change.

I have been a fan of Wai Lana's yoga training since her early TV shows. She gives the best, clearest, most detailed instructions and holds the poses the longest of any teacher out there. Along with the integrity of her yoga instructions, Wai Lana uses the hold time to illuminate the benefits of each asana, which serves to motivate me to hold the asanas. Wai Lana's instructions are always filmed outside; looks like they are shot on the California coastline and sometimes in the Red Rock region near Sedona. It is amazing that she can hold these long, long poses with the wind whipping her hair around and water spraying up from the waves. Be glad you only have to hold them from the safety of your mat with only your cat to imperil you. It means that Wai Lana is super, super strong, as well as, very flexible. You only get that kind of strength from holding the poses really, really long. So don't be lazy, stick with her and you will get stronger in tiny increments from daily practices which are never boring.",1321228800,24,1324,4.422131147540983
8367962,5,B002EOVX7Y,"These dvds are a little longer than the other dvds (the easy and the wake up series), but they are great.  I am pretty fit but unflexible and this is a great way to increase flexibility and also work on strength training if (like me) you don't like weights but feel that the work out from just cardio isn't enough.

Obviously Wei Lana's usual soft voice, beautiful natural landscape and calming meditation at the end is the perfect way to start the day.",1308787200,10,453,4.445783132530121
8367963,5,B002EOVX7Y,"There are three 50 minute practices: flexibility, strength, and stamina.  What I love about the series is that each DVD is very creative. Plus the flexibility DVD really does concentrate on flexibility.",1296864000,12,202,5.3125
