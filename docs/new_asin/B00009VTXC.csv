1891118,1,B00009VTXC,"Horrible, horrible and horrible. This was the worst version of any ""truelife"" crime movie I have ever seen. What were the directors thinking with all the jumping scences. The story was more focused on the 2 investigating police detectives than the Nightstalker himself. Furthermore, after reading several serial killer articles, books etc, this movie was only about 50% accurate. Don't waste your money.",1061164800,,403,5.412698412698413
1891119,3,B00009VTXC,"So far, it looks like only two people have rated this film.  One of them gave ""Nightstalker"" a 5, while the other gave it a 1.  I'll give it a 3, splitting the difference.

This film is probably a fail, but it's not as big of a fail as you might think.  During the opening credits I cringed, and thought to myself, ""Oh, man.  Why did I waste a few bucks on this garbage?""  Luckily, I gave it a little more time.  But I think the biggest problem with this film:  they tried to get a little too artistic with it all, making it come across at times as a bad 80s MTV video.  Most films try to come from one person's viewpoint, but this film comes from two:  Richard Ramirez, one of the most sadistic serial killers of all time; and Roselyn Sanchez, who plays a homicide detective and actually gives a really strong performance here.  Probably stronger than the film ultimately deserved.  But how do you show a film from two viewpoints?

Well, when the film is coming from Mr. Ramirez's viewpoint, he's usually accompanied by the Devil.  (I kid you not).  And at the same time, the camera shakes and so does his head; after all, he's on drugs and that must be what it's like to be really, really high.  But when the film comes from Ms. Sanchez's viewpoint, well, the camera doesn't shake and she's the main character in the scene.  Oh, and the Devil doesn't seem to be around.

I'll admit that I'm not an expert on the true Nightstalker case, and I'm not an expert on Mr. Ramirez.  I did watch a YouTube interview with him, and he tried to be deceptive when asked if he's a Satanist.  He hedged on, ""Are you evil?"" but he finally answered something like, ""Yes, I'm evil, but not 100 percent.""  And he added something along the lines of, ""But everyone is evil.""  I may not agree with Mr. Ramirez on much, but I will admit that he does have a point here.  Have you ever met anyone that is truly ""good""?  I sure haven't.  Especially Mr. Ramirez.

So, I'll stick with my 3 rating here, albeit a pretty weak 3.  I'll give it a very minor recommendation if you're interested in the genre, but otherwise, this would be a pass.",1370390400,,2114,4.299492385786802
1891120,5,B00009VTXC,"NIGHTSTALKER doesn't follow the Richard Ramirez serial killer facts too closely. But that's not what this film is about.

This is history told as a horror film. Indeed, as a religious parable.

We see Ramirez's killings through his own eyes. He stalks and kills his victims while an albino Satan with a blood-stained mouth flashes about him, head shaking quickly. Ramirez himself flashes about the scene. It's a series of killings seen through the eyes of an insane drug addict. It sets the mood of Evil. It works.

(Although the fast head shaking was first used in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jacob-s-Ladder/dp/B003TRMLQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jacob's Ladder</a>, it may be that this film's albino Satan later inspired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>.)

Evil is the theme, to the point of religious parable. Ramirez not only sees Satan, he orders his victims, ""Say you love Satan!"" He tells Satan, ""I did it for you!"" Naturally, his apartment abounds in upturned pentagrams, written in blood.

Ramirez's nemesis is Rosalyn Sanchez, who plays an East L.A. cop--who's also a devout Catholic. She prays fervently every night, the camera hovering in extreme closeup about her quivering lips, her tightly clutched rosary, focusing in and out at the aged crucifix she prays before.

Sanchez (Detective Martinez) is surrounded by encroaching evil. Her black police lieutenant boss sexually harasses her. His head shakes quickly (as does Satan's head), thus linking him to Evil. Sanchez's Latino partner snorts coke in the squad car, his head shaking quickly. Sanchez's white partner turns vigilante, his head shaking quickly. The Evil is everywhere, in all races.

All three men behave in a mostly decent (if roughshod) manner throughout the film. None of their indiscretions are followed up plotwise. Rather, the Evil just lurks there, surfacing on occasion, but always beneath the surface of those Sanchez might trust.

The Evil lurks in women too. Sanchez is betrayed by a gal reporter, who uses Sanchez as a source, then breaks confidence, exposing Sanchez as her source. Sanchez had given a police sketch of Ramirez to the reporter, hoping it would save lives. Sanchez's motives were pure, but the reporter didn't care about saving lives, only making a name for herself; exposing Sanchez saved no one, but made the story juicier. The reporter also snorts coke, her head shaking quickly.

Sanchez has other problems. Her aging mother is senile, a burden on Sanchez, who's turned down better job offers to stay in East L.A. and care for her mother. These problems are additional crosses for Sanchez to bear as she prays to Jesus.

The Evil is everywhere. The film is set in 1985, and TV sets throughout the film carry newscasts of crises in the Mideast, the poison plant leakage in India, US support of Iraq, and the Ramirez killings.

No, this is not a ""true crime"" film. It's shot in the aesthetic style of a horror film, and it's about a devoutly Catholic woman seeking divine help in her fight against Evil. Sanchez is the moral core of this darkening universe as Evil encroaches on her from all directions.

I can see that many true crime fans were disappointed. I don't think horror fans would be upset. The cinematography is beautiful. (And yes, so is Sanchez.)",1367539200,,3457,5.381481481481481

1891123,2,B00009VTXC,"Entirely inspired by The Nightstalker case with much artistic license implemented. Ramirez is portrayed here as a real simpleton, completely drug-addled, barely able to speak, except yelling ""Say you love Satan!""* to his victims. The actor does not look at all like Ramirez, but actually more like Trent Reznor, if anyone.

Taking place in the midst of the Satanic Panic hysteria during the bloody remmus of '85, music from Deicide permeates the film instead of his favorite band AC/DC. A 'demon' appears to him frequently, in the form of a pale, bald man resembling a muscular Nosferatu, alluding that he is 'possessed'. The modus operandi is that he kills for ""Satan""** ... and drugs.

The character herein hunts down a lovely female police officer turned homicide investigator on the case, who at one point leaks the suspect sketch to an unscrupulous reporter, who not only publishes the sketch, but her address in the paper! Of course, the Nightstalker goes searching for her residence, lurking about, leaving a bloody pentagram on the door of her mother's room as a 'warning', She later tracks him down to a darkened street where he was in congress with a favorite prostitute. Seems the character is quite a foot fetishist. Her partner is a grizzled cop named Frank Luis played by Danny Trejo, who is dispatched by the serial killer, while the resident Lieutenant nurses spiked coffee from his mug during duty.

During the final scenes in the film, one finds oneself remarking, ""That's not at all what happened!"". No mention of the Avia shoes, or his trip to San Francisco, or the beating from East LA residents.

In the end, the real story is much better than that cobbled together by this movie. The Nightstalker is portrayed here more like a character in a bad slasher film with 'occult' overtones, than any resemblance to actual events.

In short, if you are looking for factual information on the Richard Ramirez case, or even a semi-factual fictional rendition, it will not be found here. Instead, this film comes off as being another characterization altogether, with general similarities.

I don't know why the movie is called ""nightstalker"" and based on Richard Ramirez because NONE of the facts are even close to reality. I love serial killer movies but if you are going to start a movie off by saying ""based on true events"", at least have some of them. If you have ever read ANYTHING on Richard Ramirez you are goint to be completely frustrated with so many aspects of the movie. Real quick. the director must think that the entire LAPD are either racists, sexiest or alcoholics. Also everytime you show ""the nighstalker"" you don't have to show him smoking crack and having that monster appear and have him shake with the horrible sound effects. Also if you are doing a movie on a serial killer have a few facts correct. Here are some of the mistakes: There was no lead female dect. on the case, he was never stabbed during a rape, LAPD do not take their cars home for their personal use, he was not a size 9.5 shoe, the police NEVER released the wanted poster for him (the San Fran Mayor did), there was never 666 on the walls.

A psychotic drug addict possessed by demons who spends his night looking for blood.

Hes in his car having crazy drug trips, flashing lights , heads shaking back and forth, psychedelic trips, Idiot cops trying to find him. The plot is horrible.

1891136,1,B00009VTXC,"This movie is based on a True Story<<--i used capitol letters, wow.  However, it is not from the real world that i know of and really is a ""slasher"" with three conflicting tones or more like formulas, maybe even four: the brutal realism of a docudrama, the ""slasher"" horror flick, feminist pic a la ""silence of the lambs"" and then fourth,  even a thriller.  All have loose ends.

  Roselyn Sanchez and Frank Luis both competently play partners in the LAPD who arrive at the first murder scene where a victims eyeball was taken out found by Sanchez in the fridge.  Then their dialogue suspiciously seemed a bit too light to the whole situation--Luis decides to one-up a homicide detective in his own way as they leave the scene and they seem to want to just get some donuts afterwards. Then they arrive at more crimes and even Sanchez religious mother seems to have been saved by her godly aura from the killer as he breaks in her house.  Meanwhile, in between barfing at crime scenes, Sanchez at first seems to have a knack for catching homicidal killers.  Then, of course having little to no reaction AGAIN as she did at first crime scene, she does nothing at numerous inappropriately sexist advances during her new ""promotion"" to homicide.  She does nothing apparently because she may get fired.

  Surprisingly, all these things i pointed out are the only good things in this movie and would have worked if it weren't for this director trying to add in all these other tones.  All these things would be okay if this were a docudrama. We learn nothing about Richard Ramirez except that he hides his face with his long hair and needs  streetwise prostitutes for company before saying never mind and killing and raping them and everyone else that seems more helpless.  All these things are intercut with the killer's perspective as he kills and kills and kills hiding his face from anyone who looks at it, yes, even his victims are not allowed to look which is why they say her eyes were cut out at the first scene.

  I should have known immediately, as another Amazon review pointed out, that the music the  killer listens to is modern satanic rock that couldn't have existed at his time.  That should have immediately told me that this film is lacking in its realistic docudrama portrayal. And everytime we see him we also see flashes of a devil demonic guy that jumps around like well, a modern satanic rocker would with vampire teeth and white painted skin.  This is supposed to show us the killer's mindset which we find out is more of a satanic ritual--he paints things like devil and pentagrams in blood at various murders.

  So, the movie turns into a ""slasher"" after all.  The movie portrays Richard Ramirez as some plot marker just like everyone else in the movie.  Sanchez is religious at home, but lets her partner sniff coke while in police car with her. Then being chased by an imaginary killer(slashers do that, uh, oh, its a cat), and then the actual killer.  She also allows herself to be sexually harassed numerous times just so she can stay as homicide detective to catch the killer and oh, yea, its personal because her mother was almost killed and now she is almost killed after all that.",1112400000,2,3211,4.635398230088495

Those who can't handle creative cinematography, stop now and save yourself the headache. Those of us with a taste for the surreal have a lot to chew on. The only real drawbacks of the film are that Ramirez, in life was a real character. He wasn't just a loon, he was an interesting person. It would have been nice to see that side of him expressed in the film. Also, the Sandra Bullock lookalike as the police woman who catches Ramirez. Nice plastic surgery babe. And lastly, the plot didn't stick completely to the facts. However, the essence and the overall story is true. Also the film is sick and disturbing as it should be. You're a hardened person if you can watch this movie without being even remotely disturbed. I did enjoy how the filmmakers portrayed Ramirez's relationship with his demon. A spiritual entity who possesses him and who commands him to kill, but later betrays him and leaves him to be caught. I also loved the Industrial and Death Metal soundtrack which added to the frantic approach. Overall I found it to be a very entertaining film, giving us a glimpse at the psychosis and spiritual struggle within Ramirez rather than a more digestable and ""normal"" approach. It was wonderfully demented and a good movie. It would have been better if they stuck closer to the facts however.",1072656000,,1611,4.597222222222222

1891144,3,B00009VTXC,"If your looking for great interesting plot, its not its strength. What you get is psycho murders people-cops hunt-cops find-psycho goes to jail....But I felt that after seeing most of the current wave of serial killer DVD's out that this was one of the strongest. The camera work / editing was the star of the show. Even though we've seen bits of this style before, I found the wild, surreal kinetics to be truly entertaining. Yes if you liked the movies styles of Jacob's Ladder, Nat Born Killers, Spun & Requiem for a dream...you'll love this. Watch it for the editing, not for the storyline..... I bought my copy and am not unsatisfied at all.",1069545600,,646,4.626086956521739
1891145,1,B00009VTXC,"It's true.  The cover is the only decent thing about this movie.  I like a good horror flick like the rest of them and being based on a true story, I thought it would definatley be worthwhile.  Wrong.  This movie drags. It is completely anti-climactic. It opens with crazy camera effects, in the style of Jacob's Ladder, and fades from there.  The acting is weak, there are no good build ups as it seems put together without much thought, and doesn't deliver the eerie feeling that good horror movies can bring.  It's filmed in the dark and the spooky scenes are rushed so it just seems like one big ""filler"" of lame dialogue and poor acting.  On the whole, the movie is anemic.",1064534400,2,678,4.463414634146342

Directed and written by Chris Fisher.

A full complete story of killer Richard Ramirez and all of his ""Night Stalker"" killings has yet to be told.  This film is not the one.  This is a very poorly-made drama and badly filmed project.  The sexual acts and the murders are all shown in a very fast speed.  Subliminal quick shots.  It goes by too fast for the naked eye to see every frame.  You will have to slow down, ""step"" or frame by frame your DVD playing to see what is going on.  Not a very detailed and not much insightful information given in this one. The makers were too carried away with the special effects. This version of Richard Ramirez is all wrong. Even the capture of Ramirez is wrong.  He actually was caught in the daytime by one man and the rest of the neighborhood chased after him.  This film does not portray that.  The special effects of the  evilness of Ramirez (the evil spirit shown in special effect) is probably accurate, I mean it sets the tone of what Ramirez is. Bret Roberts plays ""Richard Ramirez, The Nightstalker"".
  DVD includes in special features, two deleted scenes.

1891147,3,B00009VTXC,"The story of 1985, notorious serial killer, Richard Ramirez,
who assumed he was under the influence of Satan powers, whilst raping/murdering his 7 victims in LA. Anyone with half a brain would realise that this man was under no satanic power, but under the hypnotism of cheap 'Angel Dust'...
Now, to the film. Well the film brings in much grit & grime,
showing us most of the rapes/murders. Problem is that the only times we get a little insight to Ramirez/Nightstalker is only when the satanic fella is committing the murderers.
And believe me, it isn't much.
What takes up most of the footage are inside dramas of the detectives & beat-cops on the investigation, which is quite cliched anyway.
The good part of the film, even though repetitive after a while, is the camera-work/editing when Ramirez hallucinates the demon following him, whenever evil sparks inside of him.
This looks very trippy & freaky. Great with any kind of acid.
Oh yes, and the film is ONLY inspired by Ramirez's murders,
this isn't a re-telling of the events that happenend in 1985.
So don't be disappointed if you realise that you are watching a b-movie rip-off of Seven, instead of Ramirez's biopic.",1061596800,2,1177,4.8316831683168315

It has more to do with the fictional female cop who never even existed in the first place than ol richard himself. If he ever saw this film himself and what a victimised wimp they made him out to be when the ""demon"" wasn't pulling his strings, im not sure how he would have reacted himself but im sure as sure can be it wouldnt be a positive reaction. I wonder if this movie was just someones way of getting back at richard remirez (hope thats spelled right) for being so defiant and carefree during his trial as he would just laugh at you if you hated on him. This is it. The closest thing to justice for the victims familys as its EVER going to get. Laughable.",1458000000,,804,4.296052631578948

7993216,1,B00009VTXC,"This was a pretty bad rendition of a horrific story.  I didn't care for the erratic camera jumbling when the killer was committing his crimes.  I think I understand why the director did this but it just didn't flow very well and I found it very disruptive.  I am very familiar with this story and while obviously you cant tell this huge of a story in a 90 minute movie without having to omit some things.  Major details were changed and things were just left out.  I just felt like this was thrown together.  I have read books on this, read many articles and seen other movies and the director/writer didn't even seem to try to care to make this true to the story.  Lets not even talk about the ending.  I don't want to spoil it but I will just say the way Richard Ramirez was caught at the end of this film was not how it really happened so I really don't know why they chose to show it this way.  I just feel this was a very poor representation of what really went down, it wasn't told very well and was frankly put together very sloppily.",1417996800,,1041,4.190954773869347
7993217,1,B00009VTXC,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this movie!  This was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen!  I had to force myself to watch it because I bought it.  It was dark alot of the movie and anytime I guess they were supposed to be showing Richard Ramirez all it did was this irritating noise and flashes of weirdness.  This was so bad...I could have done a better job!,1408924800,,360,4.028169014084507
7993218,3,B00009VTXC,"First, Stay away from the Blu-Ray disk released by SG Entertainment. It's a very poor transfer, fuzzy.  Resolution is very bad; looks like someone copied it from a poor quality VHS tape.  One of the extras is the trailer for the movie, and the trailer is clearer than the feature.

The movie is about the serial killer nicknamed the Nightstalker, and that's about all that's factual about this movie.  The real high points in this film are Roselyn Sanchez and Danny Trejo, who both add class to something that otherwise makes you scratch your head at times and say, ""That's not true.""

However, Ms Sanchez is very believable and keeps the viewer concerned about her character's well being.  I think Ms Sanchez' portrayal of Detective Martinez is the selling point of this film & the only reason to watch it. She plays a great character & keeps the viewer wondering what's going to happen to her.  IMO, this would have been a better movie had the writers focused more on the character of Detective Martinez & her home life, her friendship with Officer Luis (Danny Trejo), her struggles within the 1980s LAPD, and how it all intertwines with her investigation of a sadistic serial killer.  They could have just left the Nightstalker's name out of it. It would have been more interesting and made a better movie, instead of the viewer saying at the end of the movie, ""That's not what really happened.""",1374364800,,1398,4.724279835390947
