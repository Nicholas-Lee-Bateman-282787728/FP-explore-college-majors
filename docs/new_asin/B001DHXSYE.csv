8293291,5,B001DHXSYE,Worth watching if you want to understand a critical moment--100 years ago--in the race consciousness of the United States. You have to realize that many black men were tortured and killed because of Griffiths' original 1915 hate flick. It requires not only a decent but a subtle intelligence to reinterpret something so vile for better purposes. It's innovative cinema too. A reworking of a past work of art into something with quite a different meaning. Miller is a genuine talent.,1434412800,,482,5.0375
8293292,4,B001DHXSYE,"This remix culture film is a course  in itself on the history of race politics in this country (USA) as well as the addition and use of film to further political agendas. By no means the first smear tactic it is most likely the first American film utilized that way. I bought 5 copies to distribute among others including my grandson in hope he never accepts media whitewash and pablum on face value.
This film is somewhat homework but still highly recommended.",1421280000,,461,4.621951219512195
8293293,3,B001DHXSYE,"DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, launched his film/music/multimedia performance piece ""DJ Spooky's Rebirth of a Nation"". A live audio/video re-mix of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation which includes footage from choreographer Bill T. Jones and a score composed by DJ Spooky, ""Rebirth of a Nation"" was commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival, the Festival d'Automne a Paris, the Spoleto Festival USA, and the Vienna Festival.",1385769600,,432,5.367647058823529
8293294,2,B001DHXSYE,"I was hoping this remake would go beyond the obvious insights (North vs. South, Black and White) and offer something original. Some of the special effects are nice (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1), but if you're interested in this film just get the original and draw your own conclusions. There were a lot of unanswered questions in my mind, and this version just harped on the obvious ones over and over again.",1264550400,,429,4.443037974683544
8293295,3,B001DHXSYE,"Having never seen DW Griffiths' film before I was glad to be able to see it through this 're-mix'. I guess I was expecting something radically different from the original, though this was not to be. With the addition of an ongoing commentary offering the writer's readings of Griffiths' film, and the addition of graphic interjections on parts of the action, the film seems to be otherwise in tact.

My curiousity about the actual film was satisfied. If the orginal isn't all there (I haven't checked with any original) then there is certainly enough to understand what it was all about. I guess the music track also is re-worked as part of this artist's re-packaging.

I didn't really ever want to spend money on Griffiths' film, but it seems I have done through this re-mix.

If that goes to this artist to support further creative-critical experiments, then I guess that's OK.",1249171200,,879,4.80794701986755
8293296,4,B001DHXSYE,"Now, while the same effect could be gained from just watching ""Birth of a Nation"" and making your own judgment, DJ Spooky brings up some very valid points and adds some valuable background information on the film's condonation in Washington and its effects on the subconscious mind of both Black/White America.
I think its definitely worthwhile, not just for students, but for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of the Black hysteria that both predated and outlived the Red Scare of the McCarthy era.",1249084800,,512,4.965116279069767
8293297,4,B001DHXSYE,"""Rebirth of a Nation"" is a remix of the extremely influential and controversial 1915 film ""Birth of a Nation"" by D.W. Griffith.  The film tells the revisionist history of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era in the South and the rise of the KKK, all of this from a white supremacist viewpoint.  The images are literally racist propaganda, and was even used as a recruiting tool for the KKK.

Paul Miller, AKA DJ Spooky -- That Subliminal Kid, (who is also a Professor at the European Graduate School) created an amazing, intellectual, thought provoking remix out of D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"".  His main premise seems to challenge the viewer to question the films affect on our world today, and specifically, on the power that mass media has in influencing which lens we see the world through.
There's no doubt about it, D.W. Griffith's images are compelling.  This is at once disturbing and moving, and Paul Miller's point comes across quite well.

The visual effects are captivating, and entice you to follow the DJ as he deconstructs the images and the stories they tell.  The music further aids him in is task.  Towards the beginning of the story, the concentration is obviously on the storyline itself, and the music mostly follows the film.  Yet as the film progresses, and the white men are shown as heroes and saviors in D.W. Griffith's version, Paul Miller's music ""devolves"" into a spooky, disjointed melody, exposing its sordid ""morals"".  The film itself is overlain with narration about the storyline, Paul Miller's process, information about the film historically, and references to connections between the film and ongoing problems in our society today.

The only reason I did not give this film 5 stars was because I think there could have been many more special features available.  There is an option for Paul Millers commentary to play along with the film.  I definitely recommend watching it with the directors commentary on after your initial viewing.

This film is a must-see for anyone interested in race relations in America today, or for anyone interested in new ways of producing digitally manipulated and remixed film and video.",1232755200,7,2163,4.972222222222222
