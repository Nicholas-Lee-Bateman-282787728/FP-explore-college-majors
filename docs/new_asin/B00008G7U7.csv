8500659,4,B00008G7U7,"Being a novice drummer back in the 90's I found this instructional video very helpful.  I believe it was one of the first beginning drum videos made at the time.  I disagree with the second reviewer and wonder why she felt the need to be so venomous... Maybe she has stake in the other videos she mentioned or Mr. Pedersen dissed her in a bar... (LOL) Who knows.  If you're looking for solid information - and you're not judging on ""acting"" skills and band ""coolness"" - I recommend this video highly.",1287273600,6,500,4.472527472527473
8500660,2,B00008G7U7,This video is rather cheasy. Save your money and put it towards a Tommy Igoe or Mike Portnoy video. The instructor is a terrible teacher with no personality. You might learn something but you would learn so much more with another video. It is one of those videos where you would think the guys in the band were trying to look silly. I think the other review was written by the instructor himself. If you need a good laugh buy this video.,1281139200,,437,4.341463414634147
