The acting was poor.
The background music was a piano playing the same short melody over and over--annoying.",1501113600,,166,4.566666666666666
8657732,5,B00KD5MPDM,"This movie blew me away by how good it was. It is a dramatic film at heart, with a LOT of dialogue. In fact, probably 90% of the movie is just two men sitting in a coffee shop talking, but it was so compelling and well acted! All of the actors did a great job, and the man who plays the gay character is amazing. It's very fun and informative to watch, and shows you that you can have an open heart to all people, and love them no matter what. It reminds us to stand up for what we believe in. Wonderful film. Go watch it now.",1485216000,,526,3.8796296296296298
8657733,5,B00KD5MPDM,"At the center of this movie is an open debate on the biblical principles of homosexuality. It's engaging and addresses the issue in a loving, kind and compassionate way that is firmly rooted in God's Word. For this alone it is a noteworthy movie that is a must see. At the end, the main character dares you to stand up for what you believe in a thought-provoking way. Now, this is not a high production Hollywood movie, it is clearly low budget - it is the content that makes it 5 stars. The debate explores both sides of the topic to make it an overall compelling and educational.",1484352000,,581,4.388888888888889
8657734,5,B00KD5MPDM,"This was a great movie.  The quality was not the best, but the story opened up you mind to better ways of thinking.  I would recommend everyone see this to give them a more open way at looking at people with different beliefs.",1442361600,,226,4.232558139534884
