8447891,1,B004Y1U5YW,"With the presentation of this set I was expecting a current, or least the last five years sampling of glorious Canada.
The DVD's were out dated in every way. I really regretted this purchase!",1358985600,,191,4.647058823529412
8447892,2,B004Y1U5YW,THE OVERALL PICTURES WERE NICE BUT WERE TAKEN FROM THE 1980'S I MEAN THEY NEED TO UPDATE THIS ITEM IN GREAT DETAIL. MOST OF THE DVD'S  WOULD OVERLAP THE SAME CONTEXT SO THERE WAS NO INFO GIVEN AS FAR AS NEW INFO JUST REPEATED. SO I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS SET A GOOD RATING. CHECK OUT OTHER DVD'S WITH BETTER FOOTAGE AND MORE UP TO DATE INFO. ON HOTELS AND ACTIVITIES.,1335139200,,364,4.126760563380282
8447893,2,B004Y1U5YW,"We found this boxed set of 8 CD's very disappointing.  The release date was meant to be 2011 but most of the CD's had outdated footage - it looked like it was filmed in the 1980's. A couple of the CD's were a bit more modern. The other disappointment was that there was a considerable overlap of material, e.g., the identical footage that was used in Vancouver was repeated in Victoria.",1327708800,,386,4.436619718309859
8447894,5,B004Y1U5YW,"Saw this item in another catalog and decided I'd try Amazon.  Surprised they had it.  Husband wanted it and
I ordered it.  He has viewed all of the 8 DVD's.  Thoroughly enjoyed them.",1322956800,,182,4.424242424242424
8447895,2,B004Y1U5YW,Print quality was good but it was my mistake that I did not bother to check what period this belonged to. The DVD was produced in 1995 and does not look fresh. The service of Amazon was good as expected and I got the product delivered earlier than expected. I would not underrate the content of the DVD as it is a summary of the provinces in Canada. It is useful if you are looking for a shallow overview of Canada. My intention was to build up my knowledge base before moving to Canada.,1239753600,2,487,4.191489361702128
