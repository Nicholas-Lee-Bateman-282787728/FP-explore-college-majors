8435847,1,B004M9QNP6,"This film is an extraordinary waste of time.  A man sees a rock on an island far in the Pacific and (probably suffering from a head injury) decides it must be a Mayan monument.  Ignoring established archeology and the details of history, he spins a marvelous tale of how a Mayan King left his kingdom to build a monument that looks nothing like any Mayan monument.  This moves at a Glacial pace with the narrator frequently repeating points as if asserting profundity created significance.",1355529600,2,489,4.7976190476190474
