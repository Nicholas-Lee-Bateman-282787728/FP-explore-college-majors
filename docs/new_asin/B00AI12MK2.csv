8551839,4,B00AI12MK2,"Well done and informative documentary.  The fact that they included Greg Louganis made a big difference to me because I think he had a particularly rough time coming out due to social pressure and his father, and I guess I can relate more to his situation (although I'm certainly no-where near to him in terms of life accomplishments!!).  Anyway, the whole production raised a lot of issues that we LGBT people have to deal with, and it was done in an intelligent, non-aggressive, and balanced fashion.  One of the best documentaries I've seen on the topic of coming out/being out.  Highly recommended!!",1446422400,2,603,4.882352941176471
8551840,5,B00AI12MK2,"There is just so much to recommend this movie. It is a basket of stories of real people who are just being sincere about their experiences of coming out. You hear from parents and their children and just so many brave stories of self discovery and acceptance. You realise how much time children spend trying to gain approval from their parents and how discerning parents can be, and more importantly, how accepting they can be. I was moved several times during this movie by the darkness that so many gay people journey through on the way to self acceptance.
This documentary has a great deal of content and it may take a lot to take it all in at once.  Fear not, you can look at it over and over and find something new there.
Please take the time, i promise you won't regret it.",1361404800,4,779,4.372413793103449
8551841,5,B00AI12MK2,"This film addresses many survivors' stories who came out before us.  Their stories and personal experiences can inspire the next generation to come.  Bullying, gay bashing are still going on regularly in our society.  A film like this is much appreciated.",1359504000,4,255,5.170731707317073
8551842,4,B00AI12MK2,"On the surface, the new documentary ""Out In The Open"" has a definite ""It Gets Better""-vibe, as it consists primarily of various gay, lesbian and transgender people talking about the problems they faced growing up, being tormented by peers, possibly shunned by family and friends, but also how they managed to cope with it all, and found self-acceptance, success and happiness in time.  The film starts off as a parody of a mid-20th Century TV show spotlighting ""Homosexual Demons"" and what they do to society.  Cute as an attention getter, and provides a backdrop of the prevailing attitudes in which many of us may have grown up.

Besides offering an unusually diverse group of interviewees, the pluses include the heartfelt interviews with Olympic diver Greg Louganis. Carson Kressley (""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy""), actors Eric and Eliza Roberts (who have a lesbian daughter), and Broadway heartthrob Josh Strickland, as well as several interviews with close friends, family members and co-workers of some of the LGBT folk interviewed, giving their perspective on their struggles. The documentary's writer/director Matthew Smith is also interviewed in his film, along with his partner Solly Hemus. Segments also include comments from their family members about their respective childhoods, how they met, etc. Not really any new ground here, but a nice, concise look at various experiences, attitudes and outlooks.

Not rated, but would be a mild R for sexual discussions, the DVD is set to contain many extras, including short films by at-risk LGBT youth. My screener copy had some sound issues, which I have been assured have been fixed for the actual DVD release. Definitely a worthwhile effort, which I give four stars out of five.",1359504000,3,1741,5.163120567375887
