2035669,5,B0001WTWPG,"I really enjoyed this Nova series and think that Neil DeGrasse Tyson did a great job as host (fortunately, my local library has many fine Nova and other PBS productions).  His engaging narration echoed the drama of what the early Earth must have gone through. We see simulations of constant meteroroic and asteroidal impacts and collisions on a then-toxic Mother Earth. He references Earth's evolution to a 24-hour period, with us humans coming along about 30 seconds before midnight.

We ponder the evidence for non-Earth life within our own Milkyway and learn how spiffy instruments let us deduce the gravitational pull that only planets could have over their corresponding stars.  If a star is wavering, then scientists will check that out as a sign of the star's gravitational interaction with an orbiting planet.

With deductive skills that surpass Miss Marple and Sherlock Holmes combined, these modern scientific detectives have culled for themselves a wealth of probable scenarios about how life first began (electrically charged meteorites and space debris introduced our planet to the building blocks of protein), how the moon was formed (gravity and colliding sperical bodies), how Earth's atmosphere went from toxic to biospheric (oxygen-producing bacteria morphed our planet's atmosphere from a noxious 1% oxygen component to a hospitable 21%), and how time plays the key role in accommodating and tracing the ""origins"" of life.

The early Earth was violent, volatile, and fiery (with lava oceans and molten rock; molten metals made their way into the planet's core--this hot core has many implications, including life itself); a far cry, says one scientist, from a Garden of Eden. (Even the Garden of Eden would depend on the planet's initially harsh conditions that would eventually--4.3 billion or so years later--lead to lush vegetation and life as we know it.)

The Earth is home to fantastic biodiversity, representing the unlimited imagination of God.  I am in no way less impressed if God chose billions of years to bring about life as we know it than if God accomplished the task in less than a week.  We're only splitting hairs to worry about time frames and ""modus operandi"" (to quote another reviewer) in terms of accommodating our belief systems. Personally, I believe that God took his time creating the necessary conditions for life to originate and evolve.  I'm glad that this program examines ""the long and winding road"" version of creation.",1151193600,21,2471,5.188442211055277
2035670,3,B0001WTWPG,"What about DNA? This is the question I raised after seeing this documentary. It's the very foundation of life, the programmed instructions for everything that makes us who we are physically.  I wished this video had addressed the incredibly long odds of how this marvelous program came into being. It poses a major challenge to the Big Bang concept.

The Origins of Life DVD was well put-together, with good music, great commentary, and excellent special effects. The history of the universe was portrayed as an explosion of the universe out of a dot smaller that the one at the end of this sentence. Everything, including you and me, eventually came out of this explosion called the Big Bang. It took perhaps 20 to 30 billions of years for the energy and chemicals to combine in just the right ways to make this happen. It was aided by earthquakes, volcanoes, bombardments from space, undersea eruptions, and so on. Little-by-little creatures came into being, and one creature eventually evolved into another, depending on its environment. Eventually, we see the world as it is right now, a miracle of scientific processes and enough chance and time. Or so the story goes, or does it really? How does DNA come down to us?

I was astonished in reading Phillip Johnson's `Darwinism on Trial' last year, that the odds of a single DNA module coming together accidentally over the supposed 15 to 30 billion year age of the universe are unimaginably long. Our human DNA contains about 3-billion lines of information in a given sequence. The odds of this happening accidentally are 1/10 (raised to the 40,000th power), which is a 1 divided by 10, raised to a power of 40,000 zeroes. Dr. Francis Crick, the co-founder of DNA, came up with this number 20 years ago or so, and, to my knowledge, hasn't been challenged down from that level. Think of the chances of immediately picking out the one red dime out of a universe (the size of ours) that is full of dimes, and you are not even close to the odds for accidental DNA. The odds are off the charts!

I also read `Origins/Skeptics' which was written by DNA evolutionist scientist Robert Shapiro who thinks the odds are immeasurably greater: 1/10 (raised to the 100,000,000,000th power). Shapiro still believes DNA evolved somehow, but says we have no idea at this point how it could have happened scientifically. I respected his candor and scientific approach.

In Phillip Johnson's book, I found that Indian astronomer and poet Dr Chandra Wickramasinghe is perhaps the leading advocate of an idea called panspermia, the theory that life on earth originated from outer space. It either came in rocks exploded from somewhere like Mars (undirected panspermia), or even in spaceships sent by advanced civilizations elsewhere (directed panspermia). I'm sure this theory is a reaction to the incredibly long odds that DNA occurred accidentally, and life emanating from somewhere else doesn't mitigate those odds. He recently retired, but I'm sure you can get plenty of information from the web on him since he is very promotional about what he believes. You can easily google articles about him and his theory (recently regarding the shuttle disaster and the red rain). By the way, does this sound like astronomy or Star trek? You guessed it: I don't have a lot of respect for this theory.

Finally, I read Stephen Hawking's fascinating A Brief History of Time. In this book, Hawking postulated that if time were imaginary, thus there would be no real beginning of time, and time would essentially be infinite. Instead of the singularity called the Big Bang, there would be a smooth Einsteinian space-time continuum with no rupture at the beginning. If there is no beginning of time, then DNA would, of course, essentially have an infinite amount of time to come about. Also, of course, if matter is eternal, the necessity of a First Cause is removed. The problem is that the imaginary time is, well, imaginary. Imaginary numbers are those that contain the square root of -1; there is no number that can be multiplied by itself to make -1. If it were true, we would have a time without temporal qualities, like before, during, and after, beginning, end, etc. Imaginary time doesn't exist and is not time at all. Hawking, in fairness, is not dogmatic about imaginary time's role in the origin of the universe, but just floats it as a possible concept.

I'm sure you get the idea. DNA is too important to ignore when it comes to the subject of origins. The video should have addressed it since it is a major challenge to the Big Bang Theory.",1143244800,8,4578,4.831632653061225
2035671,2,B0001WTWPG,"The book version of ""Origins"", which I think Scientific American or maybe The Economist rightfully recommended as THE essential general science book for 2005 is the next step from David Bodanis's equally splendid e=MC2.  And because it's one step up, it's just a tad harder, especially if you're also an economist/accountant/car dealer who'd really like to understand quantum mechanics (and maybe basic string theory and how it's possible to cope with dimensions beyond the currently now unfashionable four) but skipped science at school and uni.

For this particular (nano scale) niche market, the DVD was a big disappointment because it didn't even hint at the exitance or relevance of the reeeealy interesting bits like anti-matter, dark energy & matter and the current inability of anyone to reconcile Alberts General Theory with the sub atomic or even why it matters.

However, all's not lost as the really smart 10 year old (not mine) who watched section 2; part 1 with me was totally enthralled as I imagine any one of any age who hadn't thought about or encountered astrophysics before would be.

So the questions are;

was it OK or better?  YES

do I want my money back?  NO

will I watch it again?  YES

would I lend to anyone?  only with a cash deposit upfront

would I recommend it?  ABSOLUTELY

will it drive the creationists into an early demise?  ABSOLUTELY!

2035700,5,B0001WTWPG,"""Family viewing"" might not be the first phrase that comes to mind here, but this 2-DVD set is perfect viewing for adults & children alike, or for anyone who wants to know how we & the universe came into existence. Hosted by Neil Degrasse Tyson, it examines what we know (so far) about 4 pressing questions: (1) how did the Earth come into being, (2) how did life develop on Earth, (3) could there be life on other worlds, and (4) how did the universe itself begin. Tyson does a wonderful job, explaining some fairly complicated material in a way that anyone can easily grasp. And just as importantly, his warmth & his passion for science should encourage a lot of budding scientists in the viewing audience. Given the obstacles that science faces in our increasingly anti-intellectual culture, this is no small thing.

Already a few years old, subsequent discoveries will undoubtedly fine-tune, or perhaps even invalidate, some of the information presented here. But that's the scientific method at work, a point Tyson makes more than once. Even better, without shortchanging the sheer drudge work involved, he evokes the elegance & wonder of science. Each time I watch this series, I'm filled with renewed awe that we can imagine & understand such concepts. It also gives me a real sense of perspective, reminding me that of just how small & fleeting we really are, and making me shake my head at how much of our lives we waste on unimportant things. So there's a philosophical aspect to the series as well. Frankly, it's beyond me how someone could take in this view of existence and not be deeply moved by it.

2035707,5,B0001WTWPG,"The ""Origins"" double DVD is about life in the Universe and all the related things that have to happen to make this possible. The sad fact is that we only know of one place in the Universe where life exists, namely our Earth. Finding out whether there is life elsewhere is one of the big unsolved scientific problems of our time.

If it had been easy it would have been done already. The story of the quest is an incredible one bringing together a number of strands.  We need to know how the elements of life are formed, how the Earth evolved, why having a molten core is so important to protect the Earth from the Sun, why Jupiter is important to shield the Earth from meteorites to name just a few of the issues. And we sure do not know all the answers yet. Facts are facts but we also need to understand what motivates the scientists that do this work. They are humans as well spurred on not only by scientific curiosity but also by the desire for fame and the spirit of competition.

It is a great story but one that requires a great story teller. Tyson is such a person. He tells it with interviews with the scientists involved and their passions. He uses his special effects well. He exploits the twists and turns in the story never shying away from the controversies and uncertainties. It is a complex story. It not surprising it gets a bit breathless at times. It is also not surprising that some of the material will date somewhat as time goes by. But I think he does a wonderful job to draw the threads together, never hyping the science (unnecessary anyway) and making it accessible to everyone. Finally is was fun and entertaining.

many of the theories in this video.

I found myself totally engrossed in the development of our planet, learning things that I never knew.  I had no idea that our moon was created when another planet struck earth billions of years ago, or that the oceans on our planet were actually formed from the ice on comets that hit earth during its formative years.  I didn't know that life on our planet began from the microbes that came here attached to the comets and astroids that struck earth.  I didn't know that it was because of having a planet the size of Jupiter in our solar system that we were actually shielded from the vast majority of destructive astroids that travelled through our system.  This enabled life on earth to continue without too many major interruptions.  I didn't know that scientists have already discovered other solar systems within our galaxy that have planets and the possibility of life.

2035743,4,B0001WTWPG,"This package contains 2 DVD's and about 4 hours of programming. The production quality is excellent for an educational series. The producers especially loved the visual animation of the earth colliding with a Mars sized planetesimal approximately 50 million years after the formation of the earth which resulted in the moon and a larger earth, because they used the graphic 5 or 6 times on the 1st two episodes(disc 1). The Earth was spinning 4 times faster in the early days and the moon was 6 times closer. The young sun was weaker and the atmosphere had only 1% Oxygen but within a few hundred million years there was solid crust and large volumes of liquid water. 6 hour days and up to 200 foot tidal pulls on the earth's crust by the moon's gravity with each rotation. Another concept the producer's absolutely loved was that it took almost 3 billion years for single celled photo-synthetic bacteria to bring the level of Oxygen in the atmosphere up enough to turn the planet from red to blue. When you think about it, that is a pretty awesome thing ! So for 21 hours of the 24 hour day analogy, the surface of planet earth was either lifeless(the first 600 million years (3.4 hours) or dominated by these single celled photo synthetic bacteria. Only in the last 3 hours did everything else evolve. There's more on the 1st two episodes including tests to confirm exploding meteors supplying the material for the  spark of 1st life on the planet due to peptide formation from the pressure of impact on amino acids. Episode 1 Disc 2 is goes into great detail on the possibility of extra-terrestrial life and  episode 2 deals with the making of a detailed map of the universe 380 thousand years after the Big Bang(13.7 billion years ago) when everything had finally cooled down enough to emit visible light. There are enough details in these two discs to make you think. It seems we owe our existence to serendipity as much as to inevitability. If Jupiter was not where it is for ie.,(deflecting comets and asteroids away from Earth) life would have been either extinguished or sent back to square I too many times for us to have evolved. If the earth hadn't collided with that mars sized planetesimal to form the moon we'd have a very wobbly planet with wild temperature swings. If the earth was as small as mars it's molten core would have hardened within half a billion years and it's atmosphere swept away by the solar wind. Ironically The asteroid that got through Jupiter's shield and supposedly finished off the dinosaurs was a huge stroke of luck because it allowed mammals to evolve freely eventually leading to us. Questions remain unanswered by these episodes such as,  'Why wouldn't aliens evolve faces ?' Why wouldn't other earthlike worlds have as much time for evolution as ours did ? You figure with a gas giant shield properly placed, a similar planet with a large moon in a sunlike starred solar system like ours, the time frames would be similar. The best argument put forth on this disc in my view against other technologically proficient life in the universe is the rarity of it here,(out of 100's of millions of speices in the history of multi-cellular life only we've achieved it). We could be as rare in the universe as 1 per every galactic cluster every 500 million years or less. If it were significantly more common we probably would have heard from them by now. To throw a bone to the Creationists, our existence for all practical purposes is a miracle ! As far as 'The Big Bang' or 'The Hyper-Expansion' of a super dense, super small mass to produce everything we know. It's just a theory supported by current science. We still have no clue as to where this mass came from. That would be the unanswerable question and left to whatever your concept of God is !",1155168000,31,3790,4.6537313432835825

8017321,4,B0001WTWPG,"Very informative, if a little broad. Most of the program centers around earth and its history, but has a little trouble sticking to a subject. Host Neil Tyson does an amazing job of conveying the complexity of the cosmos in a way that is easily understood by everyone. My 4 year old is always asking to watch shows hosted by him, and his personality and style definitely come through in this program.

4 stars because of its being a little broad and not being as much about the history of the universe as the title would lead one to think. Overall good program and great for the kids.",1444521600,,584,4.407407407407407

8017325,3,B0001WTWPG,"Neil Tyson is very seductive and smooth in explaining cosmic evolution.  Tyson's video is a high quality feast for the eyes, but don't let that seduce you.  The message here is atheistic, as in No Creator God....this all happened just by chance.  As a Christian I have heard this argument many times before, but Tyson entices the viewer by word and film to accept his atheistic position. So beware, if you trust the Word oF God, the Bible,  and have faith in Jesus Christ, use keen discernment if viewing this film.",1395360000,,515,4.626373626373627
8017326,5,B0001WTWPG,"The information and the pictures are out of this world! :) My 10 and 11 year old love it. Neil Tyson is quite engaging. It is a little bit of an insult that people relate him to Carl. I loved Carl, but his sleepy monotone took some getting use too. Neil is not all over the place crazy like some science educators, Ian Steward whom I also love. Neil is really engaging and inspires the imaginations of my 10,11 year old kids. I call them my two binaries; I know I have said this in many reviews before, just want the world to know before the older one turns 12.",1394668800,2,561,4.109090909090909
