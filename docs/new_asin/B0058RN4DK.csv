8462210,5,B0058RN4DK,"Jiri Kylian is fluid and eloquent in his dances and his interviews alike. Given that he speaks mostly through choreography, do we really need a documentary too? We do, provided that it is good, as this one is. The film balances on three components: Kylians biography, his work in rehearsal studios, and his dances. Close to a third of the film consists of excerpts from Kylians ballets. The structure works: through learning something about the artist, the viewer grows to appreciate his art even more. One can see how Kylian works with universal human themes desire, power, memoryand also draws directly from his own life experience. If you like Kylians choreography already, you will still learn a great deal. If you know little, you will find a fascinating artist to explore.",1467158400,,778,4.9465648854961835

8462212,4,B0058RN4DK,"This is a good film about Jiri Kylian and it has so many beautiful moments.  I would have liked it to have more, about himself and about more companies dancing his choreographies.",1355788800,2,179,4.59375
8462213,5,B0058RN4DK,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer says. Plus a few more comments - you don't have to be a balletomane to like Kylian or this documentary; just enjoying dance is enough.  In addition to dance clips and details, there is some stunning photography and video. Kylian is a fascinating personality (in the best possible way) and his commentary is straightforward and memorable. I've watched my DVD several times and can't recommend it highly enough.",1351123200,5,455,5.066666666666666
8462214,5,B0058RN4DK,"It is hard to be a balletomane for very long without running into the name of Jiri Kylian. He has choreographed many ballets, especially miniatures, and has given many interviews. He also has plenty of his pieces on several DVDs that have been released over the years. But rest assured, this documentary is new, although it does include clips of previously released works, but these are brief and only included to illustrate his style as it has evolved over the years.
I like that the very first thing we learn(in the first few lines) in this documentary is how to pronounce his name! Unless you are well versed in the Czech language, you may have wondered, as most of us have. Well, Jiri Kylian does us the honor of pronouncing his name for us, ""I am Jiri Kylian"", is how he does it. Evidently, the inverted circumflex(also called a caron) over the ""r"" in his first name is the same sound as in ""Dvorak"". It sounds like, ""Jirzhi"". Well, balletomanes really worry about details. Kylian goes on to tell us about his early life, which was during a tumultuous time for his country and the world. He also expresses his warm feelings for dancers and how he loves to work with them, and his feelings about dance in general. We also learn about the love of his life, Sabine Kupferberg, who was his muse and then became his wife.
She can be seen dancing in many of his works.
We also get to see him rehearsing some of his recent works. Included as an additional feature on the DVD is the complete performance of ""Wings of Wax"", released for the first time on DVD.
If you enjoy modern ballet, you should enjoy this.",1324684800,13,1606,4.484641638225256
