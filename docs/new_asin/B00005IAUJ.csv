1425657,4,B00005IAUJ,"Although meant to be a poor man's version of a spaghetti western, this turns out to be highly entertaining albeit not totally sensible.  Lee Van Cleef plays his usual sharp and demanding part athough not strictly as a villain but rather as a sympathetic anti-hero....La Lolla is sumptious as always and James Mason and the supporting cast keep their tongues firmly in their cheeks and the storyline plays out.",1406505600,9,409,4.927536231884058

1425659,2,B00005IAUJ,"This film is about schlemiels and schlemazels and a con-artist. A schlemiel is a person who does stupid acts, while a schlemazel is one who has bad luck. The schlemiel is like the idiot who insists on throwing his feces out of his window onto the street because his great-grandfather did it in England. ""It's a tradition,"" he says. The schlemazel is the fellow who steps into it. Lee Van Cleef and his three outlaw cohorts are both schlemiels and schlemazels, and Gina Lollabrigia, the con-artist, is the only intelligent person in this humorous farce.

 Lee - who wears a bad wig and a bowler hat that seems too small for him - and his gang undertake robbery after robbery but end up with nothing. As in the first event of the film where they rob a bank, take off with the loot, but Lee loses it to Gina who marries him for his money - or, at least, Lee thinks he is being married - and then has him committed to an insane asylum and takes off with the loot.

 The film is filled with Keystone Cop type chases. Lee and the gang are chased by Mexicans and their opponents the revolutionaries as well as bounty hunters seeking the large reward offered for their capture. James Mason has a part in a scheme to get one million dollars and doesn't act in his usual suave style. Gina moves from man to man, whoever has money. She is involved in each scheme but not to help Lee, although she says she is; she is only out to help herself. I do not recommend seeing the film; while it is funny, it is also silly.",1304467200,5,1504,4.285211267605634
1425660,3,B00005IAUJ,"Spaghetti western collectors should know the Geneon release is a nice letterboxed, widescreen transfer. Colors are slightly faded and its non-anamporphic, but otherwise this is a fantastic looking picture for a budget label. Consequently, I was able to sit back and enjoy the film as intended. Actually it is quite funny at times, and nowhere near as bad as reviews would lead you to believe.",1167177600,15,392,5.046153846153846
1425661,4,B00005IAUJ,"A western film that stands upside down right on its head. Many thieves and robbers, on the frontier with Mexico, in the midst of the Mexican Revolution, with Mexican soldiers and Mexican revolutionaries, with all kinds of gangsters and other outlaws, with frightened bankers who get held or blown up, with women who are nothing but entertainment.

Well, nearly all of them, except one who is a master mind in getting rich on the back of the thieves and robbers, the soldiers and revolutionaries, the gangsters and outlaws, the bankers and cops when necessary. She manipulates all of them men with her charm and flesh and she gets the money when it is ripe, without even making the slightest effort, except at luring all these men into falling into her trap.

And you can be sure she never shuts her trap. Brilliant and funny with a Lolobrigida that is coming of age and starting her lovely and enticing career.

7938214,3,B00005IAUJ,Not a bad movie but not a great movie.  It is a spaghetti western and worth watching keeping that in mind.  It is not Lee Van Cleef's best movie by far.  The movie's music was not very good. If you like 1970 westerns this is OK.,1483920000,,228,3.9130434782608696
7938215,3,B00005IAUJ,Don't judge this film on the awful first 11 1/2 minutes which feels like a completely different movie.. after that its just a normal decent western with some good action scenes. Also the Kino disc looks stunning.,1468713600,2,212,4.756756756756757

7938217,5,B00005IAUJ,Spaghetti western.  Saw Bad Man's River many years ago in a really terrible almost unwatchable VHS copy.  This Blu Ray copy is a 100% better.  Comedy western at it's best.,1452816000,,171,4.633333333333334

7938219,3,B00005IAUJ,"Un western parodique : une bande de ""Pieds-Nickels"" russit un hold-up fabuleux au dbut du film, une autre bande, des soldats corrompus, des Mexicains avides, des rvolutionnaires qui voudraient l'argent pour combattre le tyran, tous se font duper par une trs belle aventurire amorale ! Superbe Gina Lollobrigida ! Bien que fan inconditionnel de Lee Van Cleef, il faut reconnatre qu'elle les met tous dans sa poche ! Mais son rle est le plus beau : les autres sont des c....... qui succombent  son charme et se font avoir  tous les coups ! A la fin, tout ce joli monde poursuit la belle vnale, rvolutionnaires inclus, mais elle leur chappe encore ... Cette fin ""ouverte"" aurait permis une suite qui ne fut jamais tourne, le film n'ayant pas t bien accueilli par la presse du monde entier. Le grand James Mason est bien terne dans ce film o il s'ennuie visiblement (il l'a fait pour l'argent, pensant que personne ne verrait le film. Il raconta avec humour : ""Erreur : il fut prsent en premire de Gala devant a Reine
Elizabeth (fan de Lee Van Cleef, sans doute) et toute la Cour Royale !"" Pour Van Cleef, il fait preuve de de qualits inattendues dans le comique (ce qu'il avait dj fait avant dans plusieurs films), mais son public n'apprcia sans doute pas qu'il fut constamment ridiculis ... Si l'on n'est pas trop exigeant, c'est un bon divertissement ...",1447632000,,1353,4.656903765690377
