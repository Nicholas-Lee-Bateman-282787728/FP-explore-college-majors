The first three scene vignette attempts to be artful as if Chopin playing loudly makes the three scene ""self discovery"" episode high art; when it's nothing more than laughable 70's porn. The only redeeming feature is if someone in this is famous later on, and I do not recognize or am dimwitted enough to assume so. So the first hour is a long drawn out tease that ends in a mediocre oooh and ahh, if it ends in an orgasm, then it's porn. Then there is a mishmash or old 42nd St whores showing pink.

No plot. No dialogue. Housewives?

Yeah, it's trash. I'll check the cast for famous, and if not it won't even go to Goodwill, money wasted, straight in the trash.",1358208000,2,778,4.358620689655172
