But I am worried when you consider who will be releasing it...yes, CBS/Paramount, known for: edited episodes; changing any music that costs, well, anything; and logo plastering (I am hopeful as they usually plaster Paramount logos, and there are officially none on PJ)",1218585600,15,393,5.030769230769231

3546428,5,B001E6JC30,"The best thing about this set is that while TV Land and DejaView have ran the color episodes throughout the late '90s and 2000s, the first two black-and-white seasons were never part of the syndication package, so unless you bought the Columbia House videos back in the '90s (which only contained 18 episodes from the first two years) you've never seen these!

CBS has remastered them beautifully so the transfers look stunning and there are episode introductions by Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell (Betty-Jo and the original Bobbie-Jo, respectively).

There is a rustic charm about the black-and-white episodes that was lost when the series went to color and devolved into more wacky '60s comedy and musical numbers. Watch for Jeannine Riley as the original Billie-Jo. Her portrayal of the man-crazy eldest sister is spot-on and truer to creator Paul Henning's original vision for the character than the increasingly watered-down successors (Gunilla Hutton, Meredith MacRae) were in the role. The interplay between Kate (Bea Benaderet) trying to squeeze some work out of lazy Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) is also worth the price.",1387670400,,1131,5.208791208791209

3546431,4,B001E6JC30,"This is the best season of the show.  Which is not saying much, since the show is one of the slowest sitcoms in history.  ""And that's Unle Joe He's a movin' kind of slow at the junction""  Yep, that about says it for the show.  Not that it's not funny, at times.  I like it when Bedlow tries to stop  the Cannonball.  Those are the best episodes. I do like the settting.  The Shady Rest looks like  a great place to stay but is it a hotel or a bed and breakfast?  And how does Kate stay in busines?  You almost never see a guest.  And what is this about her trying to get a convention to stay there.  A convention.  In Hooterville? And what is up with the girls swimming in the water tank?  I hope that water is only for the Cannonball and not drinking.  And what is it with the dog?  He doesnt even have a name.  Just dog.  The best part of the show is Bea.  She was great and the center of the show.  She was a great talent.  When she died in the 5th season, it really went down hill.  I want all 7 seasons of th show, if they ever release them all,  after all it is  FAR better then the crap on today.  But it doesnt stack up to Beverly Hillbillies or Green Acers.

3546439,4,B001E6JC30,"Created by Paul Henning (1911-2005), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-1971) took America by storm, and rocketed to the top of the Nielsen ratings, as the top rated TV program of the 1962-63 season.  Having struck ratings gold, CBS turned to Henning for another series, and the result was Petticoat Junction (1963-70), which was based in large part on the childhood experiences of Henning's wife, whose family own a hotel in Missouri.  While the Beverly Hillbillies featured a culture clash between mountain and city folk, Petticoat Junction was mostly about appreciating the virtues of simple wholesome rural living.

The setting for the program was The Shady Rest Hotel, owned and operated by Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet) with the help of her Uncle Joseph Carson (Edgar Buchanan), and her three lovely daughters Billie Jo (Jeannine Riley), Bobbie Jo (Pat Woodell), and Betty Jo (Linda Kaye Henning, Paul's daughter).  Located near the railroad line running between the towns of Hooterville and Pixley, the hotel has few amenities, except for peace and quiet, and Kate's wonderful home cooked meals.  Traversing the route between the two stops is the Hooterville Cannonball, a train operated by conductor Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis), and engineer Charley Pratt (Smiley Burnette).  For supplies, folks drop in to see Sam Drucker (Frank Cady) at the general store in Hooterville.

The Shady Rest is barely getting by, but Kate and her family are more than happy with their lives.  Uncle Joe tries to boost business and generate income, but is rarely successful.  The goodwill and togetherness in the community is a universal theme.  Most of the stories involve the hotel's various guests, including salesmen, celebrities, and old friends.

One unique aspect is that a working train is a key element in the series.  A major continuing story arc concerns the C.&F.W. Railroad, owners of the Cannonball, who only recently discovered that the Hooterville line, wasn't connected to their railway system.  Crusty and grumpy Homer Bedloe (Charles Lane) is sent from the main office to investigate, and becomes determined to close down the line.  Bedloe appears in eight fun filled episodes, usually with some kind of devious scheme to put the Cannonball out of service.  C.&F.W. president Norman Curtis (Roy Roberts), also visits the Shady Rest, and is won over by the kindness of the Bradley's.  Curtis does his best to foil Bedloe's plans.

Besides the stories featuring the wonderful Charles Lane as the sneaky Bedloe, other notable episodes include, ""The Last Chance Farm"", where two ladies arrive at the Shady Rest looking to lose weight, and end up doing chores for Uncle Joe.  In a nod to Beatlemania, ""The Ladybugs"" features the Bradley girls and a friend forming a pop band, managed by Uncle Joe.  In ""Visit From a Big Star"", John Vivyan guests as a chick-magnet moviestar in need of relaxation, who becomes the center of attention for the local women.  The staff of the Shady Rest run an elaborate con game in ""A Night at the Hooterville Hilton"".  And ""Bobbie Jo and the Beatnik"" features Dennis Hopper as a poetry sprouting hippie.

Paul Henning was impressed with Bea Benaderet (the voice of The Flintstones' Betty Rubble), for her work on The Beverly Hillbillies, and Petticoat Junction became a vehicle for her, and veteran actor Edgar Buchanan.  The sexy, yet wholesome Bradley girls, offered something for the younger audience, and the program finished at #4 in the ratings.

Music and dance are important elements, as the ""Hooterville Hop"" is a dance step that is often performed by the Bradley girls, who also sing a bit.  Petticoat Junction has own soundtrack, but the program also borrows some familiar musical cues from The Beverly Hillbillies.

The premiere season features a whopping 38 episodes, on five discs.  Image quality of the black and white episodes is a little soft at times, but with few blemishes.  As a bonus, each of the episodes features an introduction by Linda Kaye Henning or Pat Woodell.  The two actors also appear in a featurette, reminiscing about their experiences.  Like The Beverly Hillbillies, the first two seasons of Petticoat Junction have been released on DVD, but the possibility of future releases for either series is apparently up in the air.  Among CBS's big three rural comedies, Petticoat Junction has the more laid back approach.  It isn't as extreme as The Beverly Hillbillies, or as abrasive as Green Acres.",1350777600,3,4455,5.076923076923077

3546442,5,B001E6JC30,"These DVD's have been out for some time but I have just finished viewing the first two seasons which are in black and white. They would go to colour in season three. Unfortunately,the rest of the seasons, are not out on DVD.
This is a gentle comedy series which you wish  really existed with it's rich and warm characters.
It tells the story of a mother,three daughters and their uncle who run the Shady Rest Hotel. Most of the stories revolve around the girls growing up,their uncle Joe, played by Edgar Buchanan,in his endless attempts to get rich with one scheme or another and Kate Bradley,the mother,played by Bea Benedaret,who runs the Shady rest. An ongoing plot involves them from trying to stop the vice-president from the railroad,Homer Bedlow, played by the excellent Charles Lane, from closing down the spur line from Hooterville to Pixley which brings people to Petticoat Junction on the Cannonball train.
This show was created by Paul Henning who had created ""The Beverley Hillbillies"" the year before. It was created for Bea Benederet who had appeared on hillbillies as Jehtro's mother.
Extra's include interviews with Lisa Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell who played Bobbie-Jo in the first two seasons. Also introductions to each episode by both of them as well as a photo gallery. I really enjoy hearing about the behind-the -scenes stories by the actors or actresses of the show itself.
In the second season, a new member would join the cast. Higgins the dog. He steals the show in every scene he is in.
If you liked ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" you will like this as well as ""Green Acres"" a companion piece to this show whose characters would appear in both series.",1342742400,5,1677,4.822916666666667
3546443,5,B001E6JC30,"Petticoat Junction is a TV sitcom that ran on the CBS network from 1963-1970. It was created by Beverly Hillbillies creator Paul Henning. Henning created this in response to CBS wanting him to create another TV sit-com with a rural theme and this is what he came up with and CBS informed him that they would show the series even without seeing a pilot episode. The creation of this series was inspired by Henning's wife Ruth, who used to tell him stories about her childhood in Eldon Missouri and those stories were the basis of the series. For those unaware, a petticoat is an old fashioned garment that women used to wear under their skirts and/or dresses.

The show is all about a widowed woman named Kate Bradley(Bea Benaderet, famous for being Pearl Bodine on The Beverly Hillbillies and the original voice of Betty Rubble on The Flintstones) who has three beautiful daughters named Betty Jo(Linda Kaye Henning, who is the daughter of Paul Henning and one of two original cast members that stayed with the show through it's entire seven season run), Bobbie Jo(originally played by Pat Woodell)and Billie Jo(originally played by Jeanine Riley)and rounding off the family is Uncle Joe Carson(played by Edgar Buchanon, who like Linda Kaye Henning, also stayed with the series throughout it's entire seven season run). They all live in a small hotel named Shady Rest where Kate runs things and her three beautiful daughters do all of the work around the hotel. Uncle Joe does really nothing much except sleep in his chair on the hotel porch or falling for every get rich quick scheme in the book much to the chagrin of his niece Kate and her daughters. Plus, whenever Uncle Joe is ordered by Kate to do some chores, he tries to find a way out by having someone else do his chores. The family also has some wonderful friends like Sam Drucker(Frank Cady), who runs the Hooterville General Store where Kate and her daughters do all their grocery shopping with the help of engineer Charley Pratt(Smiley Burnette)and his assistant Floyd Smoot(Rufe Davis), who are also friends of theirs, driving the train called The Hooterville Cannonball, which is as much a character on the show as all the human characters on it are, as Kate and her daughters, and sometimes Uncle Joe whether with Kate and the girls or alone, ride the train to the store and back to the hotel. On this series, Petticoat Junction was twenty five miles away from Hooterville.

Paramount and and it's sister company both do another wonderful job on this classic TV series of 38 episodes from it's debut 1963-1964 season. The episodes of the series look as clean, fresh and new as the day that they were initially shown. They are all here in their original glory.

Each and every episode has been digitally remastered from the original negatives and from other sources that both Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD had obtained to give us another superb and superior quality set that also makes mincemeat out of those public domain DVD sets that came out as the DVD boom was taking off. Each and everything about this classic show is all there the way that they were initially shown and had been rerun in syndication over the sporadic times that these initial black and white episodes have been shown. The black and white episodes have not been shown repeatedly as much as the later color episodes have been shown, as that was they way that I discovered this series when I was younger when they were broadcast on a syndicated Canadian TV station after reruns of The Flintstones were over. These black and white episodes are a new thing to me, but even these episodes are just as funny as the later color episodes that I knew more about.

The original theme song has also been restored. This theme song had at least one line that went unnoticed by the censors at the time, which was the line ""Lotsa Curves, You Bet. And Even More When You Get To The Junction."" referring to the railroad tracks and to the figures of Kate Bradley's three daughters who always, in the opening sequence, skinny dipped in the Petticoat Junction water tower with their petticoats hanging on the side of the tower and with their dresses hanging on the railing of the stair case of the tower. That aforementioned line went unnoticed by the censors and it's a wonder that it did through the series entire seven season run. One of the features is that you have the option of having the episodes be introduced by Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell. You also get original sponsor spots with intros by Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell, interviews with Pat Woodell and Linda Kaye Henning, interview series creator Paul Henning, with a video intro by Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell and a photo gallery that also has a video intro by Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell.

Overall, this is the finest collection of the Petticoat Junction TV series that nobody who loves this show should be without. This should be in every fans DVD library.",1337385600,3,4980,4.706422018348624

It's impossible to imagine how great a show CBS once had, and moreso to realize this was the first of the Paul Henning trilogy that would include The Beverly Hillbillies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beverly-Hillbillies-Two-Season-Pack/dp/B001LM64VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beverly Hillbillies: Two Season Pack</a>&nbsp;and Green Acres&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Acres-The-Complete-First-Season-1965-66/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Acres - The Complete First Season (1965-66)</a>. When has TV writing ever been this good?

Here are all 38 episodes on five one-sided discs, somehow all in a standard sized snap case. But don't despair, they are cleverly and safely packaged. Open the case and the inside cover has blurbs for each show. You have to take out the fifth disc to read those bits, but the other discs are on hinged panels. Finally some studio suit realized that classic TV fans are willing to pay a bit more for a quality product, which this is. Of course, it would help if it had extras.

And it does! These include video intros and interviews with Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo (Pat Woodell and Linda Kaye Henning, respectively); original sponsor shorts; a photo gallery; and a 1990 interview with Paul Henning. Everyone knows classic TV fans like to pass their DVDs (and even VHS tapes) around to their family and friends. Who needs Netflix when you can pass around these DVDs? All aboard for great TV viewing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petticoat-Junction-The-Official-Second-Season/dp/B0025X4PBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petticoat Junction: The Official Second Season</a>.",1300492800,6,2135,6.384083044982699

With what little quality programing cable and satellite TV offers today but with rates going up at least once every year we are seriously considering doing away with our satellite and going with local FREE digital broadcast channels AND the DVD's of the old shows we all enjoy.

3546457,5,B001E6JC30,"Thank you to CBS/Paramount for FINALLY releasing the entire 1st season of Petticoat Junction on DVD! I purchased the DVD from MPI which covered the first 20 episodes, plus wonderful insights from Linda Kaye Henning, but now that the full season is available (and wonderfully remastered, I must say), you have made this longtime fan very happy!

Included are clips of the sponsor ads (featuring cast members in their characters), and a delightful two-part recollection with Ms. Henning and Pat Woodell (the original Bobbie Jo). It would have been great to have the original Billie Jo (Jeannine Riley) aboard as well to share her PJ memories.

Enjoyed all the episodes, especially the one showcasing the Bradley girls (and Sheila James of ""Dobie Gillis"" fame) as the ""Ladybugs"" - as well as the musical interludes.

This show, as well as many of the other 1960s sitcoms, was a prime example of the wholesome family-oriented comedy that is sorely lacking in today's TV offerings. Now let's have the other six seasons out - OK?",1234569600,14,1023,4.936046511627907
3546458,3,B001E6JC30,"I remember watching Petticoat Junction as a kid and thinking it was pretty good, so when I saw that it was coming out on DVD I bought it right away.  Does the show hold up after 40 odd years?  Somewhat, the first few shows focus mostly on the railroad trying to shut down the Cannonball and thus putting the hotel out of business.  While the show does have some down home charm, Edgar Buchannan was doing his best Barney Fife/second bananna imatation and was pretty much wasted in the role.  One thing to consider, this was the age of a lot of shows in a season, this set has 36-ish episodes, and after about 3 you will be looking for something else to watch for a while.  Best in small doses.  There are bonus' included featuring interviews with the first Bobby Jo and Billie Jo who also do introductions to most episodes.",1232928000,5,823,4.381578947368421

These are wonderfully restored with all original music and the full length episodes. I hope fans will buy this so we can get the second black and white season as well and hopefully even more of this great series that is hard to find. CBS has definitely learned their lesson after changing the music on the second season of ""Happy Days.""",1231459200,20,462,4.511904761904762
3546462,5,B001E6JC30,"Compared to MPI Home Video, CBS/Paramount has been ""movin' kinda slow"" with their own Petticoat Junction DVD release. However, fans can now be very happy with this official and complete set of episodes from the non-syndicated first season. Working from 35mm material, CBS/Paramount delivers picture quality clearly superior to the MPI release (which was transferred from 16mm prints). Image brightness, contrast and overall sharpness are much improved in this set, which can't help but add to our enjoyment of the episodes.

The MPI release is still valuable for the excellent documentary ""The History of Hooterville,"" which contains enough interesting information and varied participants (including 100-year old Charles Lane!)to justify repeat viewing.

Let's hope the entire series will be available before too long. However, if CBS/Paramount stays true to form, this release may be the only one to contain any extras. But even if that turns out to be true, simply seeing the un-edited episodes themselves, after so many years, is one of the blessings of living in the age of DVD.",1230940800,30,1082,5.321637426900585

I cannot wait for the rest of the episodes to come out, especially seasons 5, 6 and 7 with Dr. Craig, Katie Jo and Steve and Betty Jo's marriage. If you loved this series, you won't be disappointed.

3546465,4,B001E6JC30,"""Petticoat Junction"" was commissioned by CBS-TV in 1963, following the success of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in the previous year. Producer Paul Henning reproduced the formula of his hit, except instead of having hicks come to the big city and lock horns with smarmy city-slickers, in ""Petticoat"" the city-slickers came out to the country and got charmed or bamboozled by the locals. The comedy wasn't as broad as on ""Hillbillies,"" and the show was greatly enhanced by an ensemble cast that included great character actors such as Edgar Buchanan, Frank Cady, Charles Lane and Roy Roberts. (Old-school country music fans might also appreciate the presence of cowboy singer Smiley Burnett in the role of train engineer Charley Pratt...) ""Petticoat Junction,"" which ran seven seasons and lasted for years in syndication during the next decade, isn't what you'd call great art, but it was a fun, well-produced show, and you might be surprised by how well it stands up, several decades later. This first collection, with five discs worth of vintage episodes, will give you a glimpse of what television comedy was like, way back in the Kennedy era.  It was a simpler time, and looking back at it can be a fine tonic. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1229817600,55,1245,5.0144927536231885

On the start of the end titles of the first episode they originally had a train bell introduction to them which was a nice touch for the very first episode. That was removed, but it's a minor thing compared to what they did to the third episode. They edited an entire background song where Kate and Norman are talking at the picnic toward the end. The song is "" Let the rest of the world go by"". This song sums up the entire premise of the series, IMHO. The reason why I think they took it out is because the lyrics have a reference to God in them which can clearly be heard in the original version, and of course the public cannot be reminded of any kind of supreme being.",1501804800,,791,4.245033112582782
