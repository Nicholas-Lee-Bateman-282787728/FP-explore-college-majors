8162646,4,B000LP51SA,"This isn't a very complex form so even a novice could pick it up quickly. The video quality is adequate enough but don't expect high production value. I have a few gripes about this DVD though.

First off, the translation is just down right terrible. It is sometimes comical the incorrect vernacular and the random words that do not exist in the English language. Some sentences just don't make any sense at all and it was as if someone dumped the script into a really bad free online translation service. So don't expect to learn much from the subtitles. Still, it was easy enough to fill in the blanks to figure it out.

As for instruction it wasn't terribly bad and the DVD offers different angles for you so that is good. It is short enough of a form that you should be able to mimic it within a few weeks. This must of course be understood as only something you would want to do if a proper teacher is not available for you to learn in person: something no DVD can match.

My biggest gripe about this is the lack of proper sections in the DVD for easy fast forward via chapters. If you hit the 'next section' button on your remote, you are place in odd sections of the dvd that are not correctly organized. This means lots of time using fast forward or reverse to get to the section you want. I'd give this 3 stars alone for that, but heck, for the price, you really can't expect high production quality and it served its purpose by showing me a pattern I could not get locally.

If you are a veteran Wudang Sword practioner, this will be really easy to pick up. If you are not, there is enough here to get you started on a wonderful martial art form.",1425254400,,1656,4.281150159744409
