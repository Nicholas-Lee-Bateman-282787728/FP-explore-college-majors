He saves another man's wife with no thought of repayment. He shows that he is  a man of character and honor. He never quits or gives up. A must see film  and should be considered a western classic.,948499200,31,333,4.1875

Randy Scott made 7 films with Budd Boetticher, in the late 50's early 60's, all westerns, the first ""7 Men from Now, a minor classic and three more that should be, and this is among those three, along with ""The Tall T' and ""Ride Lonesome"". They all had a formula where Scott was the tall, quite hero and the bad guy was really the more engaging and developed character. But all highly entertaining, with great writing, settings, and action.

Scott looking very good in this film and had a fine horse to ride on . The film is a little like 'Ride Lomesome "" , as a man who seaches for women who were captured by the Indians . What made me think I had the wrong movie was the music . Its the same from ""Ride Lonesome "", and started the same way. I still  enjoyed this movie alot , Im a fan of both Scott an Boethicher and their movies together. This movie clocks in less than an hour an half , I guess back then It was easy to show 2 movies atfer each other at the theaters back  in the 50's.

785654,5,6304092024,"This was Randolph Scott's second last movie and his last with Director Budd Boetticher. (His final role was in the great ""Ride the High Country."")

Comanche Station just about has it all: creative direction, a sparkling script and excellent performances by all the actors. One action sequence is stunningly realised and alone makes this DVD worth buying.

Director Boetticher, working with a tight budget, makes the most of the Lone Pine landscape, with its dusty plains and storied rock formations. There is not one interior scene in the movie. It is all shot outdoors.

The script by Burt Kennedy, a regular contributor to the Boetticher - Scott films, is a gem. He is a master of the clipped, economical dialogue which seems the way tough, poorly educated cowboys would have talked. The script deals thoughtfully with two big questions: what is a good life and what does the love between a man and his wife really mean?

This does not mean the movie has long, tedious scenes with these frontiersmen batting  Tolstoyan issues back and forth. Instead, the script keeps the dialogue realistic and economical and delivers quite some humour.

In one sequence, Indians attack the white party as it tries to cross a plain. The direction and cinematography are stunning. With the camera mounted on a moving vehicle, riders drive their horses to full gallop, firing guns or arrows, all the while framed against a towering mountain range. I could not help but replay this several times in slow motion, so transfixing was the vision and the skill of the horsemen.

Full credit to all the actors, who shine in their roles and talk like they believe what they're saying. This is Scott as I like to remember him: fully convincing as a good man, not given to talking much and willing to confront badness with implacable strength. Scott was aged 61 when he made this movie. In his excellent book ""The Films of Randolph Scott"", which I bought from Amazon, Robert Nott observes that Scott looks 48 and I think that's a fair judgment. In my eyes, Randolph looked 48 when he was 32 and didn't change from that!

Claude Akins delivers well as a scheming, deadly charmer and both Skip Homeier and Richard Rust play well as young men thinking about how to live better lives. Nancy Gates makes the most of her role and shows that she had the beauty and acting skill to have been a star had she stayed longer in the industry.

The moving, melancholy ending provides a memorable answer to the love question.",1360195200,10,2484,4.744779582366589

785656,4,6304092024,"Solid, well done western, with an elegiac, muted, deliberately paced feel, despite the tense plot.

searching for her too - there's a reward of $5000 for her return.  But Scott doesn't seem like a mercenary, unlike the three
men he's forced into joining up with after an Native American ambush.

Claude Akins plays Scott's opposite.  A man with no heart, for whom money is everything.  He has two young sidekicks, both
little more than kids, who seem to have fallen in with Akins mostly for having little other choices in life.

The film is always interesting, even if it feels pretty predictable about where it ends up.  There are a couple of good,

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ...

785661,5,6304092024,"All of Bud Boetticher's westerns are superior to many westerns received as classics. I won't mention John Ford's The Searchers or his Calvary Trilogy at all, but Randolph Scott, unlike Wayne,  can act; Scott has that vacant, self-absorbed quality in his face, forged in this film and many others  onlife styles chiefly underscored by major sensory deprivation. Budd Boetticher removes the conventional dust and the Dance Hall ""scenes"" and the irritating, endless, comic breaks, as A. Mann did with J. Stewart in The Naked Spur, as Zimmernman and Wyler did with Cooper in High Noon and the Westerner. Boetticher gives us here an almost absurdist odyssey of a man looking for his lost wife by searching for stolen white women, allegedly captured by Indians. Comanche Station, the title, functions in the film as a real place where the heart of this drama works itself out. It has, the Station, the look of Rashomon, a locale ruined by humans turned into beasts, bodies everywhere, undiscovered and visible. There's no peace at the ""station,"" nothing but chaos. A place where everything stops, where there is nothing to understand, and no truth... too much ignorance out there, and a love of racism and how it makes everything evil.

The point of Comanche Station is that there is no point; the notion in this film that a white person would have something to bring to the table in the way of protest to the Indians is what Scott knows and acts out for us. In The Searchers no such discovery ultimately infuses that film, because with Ford in westerns, it's always about the sorrows of the whites; the Indians are unimportant because they are not quite human, and therefore without moral purpose, no credentials for being in the world. In Budd Boetticher's film the native Americans are very much a cultural/  moral issue, and their vengeance in taking whites is seen as boldly civilized, compared to the white way of breaking treaties, and ghetto-izing and murdering.  Here in this film, the Comanches wear blue pants, bare tops and resemble a force for self-preservation, a dignity seldom afforded them in other westerns. Randolph Scott magnifies all of this in his portrayal, and he and the rst of the cast are brilliant.

The color, the cinemascope, not Vista Vision, are, however, crucial to this film, and the VHS tape is a pan scan job, but, the DVD should be forth coming.

See this and then watch a Wayne western...you'll see all the problems Huston had with Wayne, Hawkes had with Wayne, and countless co-stars, far above him in every way, both in  talent and insight.

Budd Boetticher: an artist and major influence, as said above, on Pekinpah and even on Anthony Mann.

See this and all of Boetticher's work.",1166745600,10,2716,4.846652267818574
785662,5,6304092024,"There was a time when Randolph Scott sat as tall in the saddle as John Wayne. It is most unfortunate that most of his work is not on DVD and some of his best (The Tall T) aren't even currently on VHS! Scott's westerns of the 50's decade revealed a versatile and talented actor, which is remarkable for a star who was instantly recognizable and reliable to play a hero of certain standards. One thing that is that is also remarkable about these films (and The Tall T immediately comes to mind) is they certainly didn't need a big budget. Instead, a good, suspenseful script, excellent cast, and dare I say, a redeeming morality made for an excellent and classic film.

After watching all kinds of Westerns: Spaghetti, modern revisionist, Hollywood 40's, 50's, 60's, & 70's, I sat down to watch a few Randolph Scott movies and was literally on the edge of my seat. And this was right after sitting through the over-the-top effects wizardry of Van Helsing! Mr. Scott's extraordinary but ordinary characters made me forget I was watching a movie and drew me into the story and issues as if they were happening to me.

Randolph Scott is virtually relegated to obscurity today compared to the major Western star he was many years ago. This is our loss. A boxed set* or two of his great Westerns would be a small step in the right direction of returning him to his proper status in film history. More importantly, after watching just a few of his movies and the realistic honor portrayed by him, I am left with the distinct feeling that the world was a better place with Randy in the saddle, and his kind will not ride through again.

785663,4,6304092024,"this astounding Western mixes a modernist treatment of space (look at the way Boetticher grids the West, through composition, editing and camerawork) with a story of mythological force - a man spends his life wandering deserts looking for his probably dead wife.  The ironical sense of an imprisoning West creates a sense of the Hell to which Cody has been condemned.  This enforced loneliness is not mere self-pitying - the old ideals of the West have been debased by genocide and greed; solitude is the only moral stand possible, and yet it cuts one off from family or community.

Image quality is rock steady. Colors breathe and look spot on. There are plenty shades of green foliage. Scott's black outfit has substance. The original widescreen 2.35:1 image is a beauty to behold. My only complaint here -- and it's relatively minor -- is occasional haloing, most notably around Scott's black clothing against blue sky.  That being said, the image overall is excellent -- a *huge* leap forward from DVD. No scratches, jarring cuts, speckles, etc. It just looks great.

Sound quality is clear, never dull. The dialog is never buried in the mix. The mono mix is your choice of the original English PCM 2.0 or the dubbed German PCM 2.0 -- and both are quite satisfactory. English and German subtitles are available.

Extras are limited but quite good. The half hour interview with Boetticher is informative and fun but doesn't concentrate on this film. The trailer is clean and clear as the film. The movie stills are great to see.

Although this is a German release and labeled Region B it plays without a glitch whatsoever on my Region A Sony player. After loading, the display goes immediately to the menu. Select the language of your choice and enjoy.

This is a great Randolph Scott film and this is an exemplary region-free Blu-ray release. Highly recommended.

Lone Pine is just east of the highest point in the U. S., namely Mt. Whitney which stands over 14,000 above sea level.  In order to hike Mt. Whitney one has to sign in at the small Lone Pine ranger station due east of the great Sierra Nevada range. Often, one can see Mt. Whitney in the background along with the rest of the magnificent landscape the area provides.  I was trying to guess where this was filmed as it was obviously not in Southern NM on the way to Lordsburg, as made obvious by the paucity of cacti in the film.
