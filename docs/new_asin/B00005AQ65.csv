1415507,5,B00005AQ65,"I loved this movie! It reminds me of the old bloodbath flicks by John Woo starring Chow Yun Fat before the two of them came to Hollywood and were forced to water down their material. This is with swords, though, so the parallels end there. Buy it and check it out....can any of the other reviewers spell GENIUS correctly or am I the only one?

1415508,5,B00005AQ65,"There hasn't been a movie with so much action and suspense for as long as I have been a movie buff! I have to admit that I am a bit of a Tarantino buff, but if you are looking for a movie with a unique story and unbelieveable action, you can not pass this movie up. The first section of this movie was unbelievable, and Part 2 is sure to wow even the most violent seeking movie buff that there is!!!!!!",1075507200,5,402,3.9753086419753085
1415509,4,B00005AQ65,"First, I wouldn't call this the best action movie ever, but it definitely ranks amongst the best.  Quentin has a unique style for action movies that sets him apart from anyone else.  His movies aren't just stories, they are intricate works of art.  This is one of his crowning achievements and will definitely be added to my video collection when it is released.
This movie is much like Pulp Fiction with moments that will forever be emblazoned in your memory under ""classic movie scenes"".  That blasted tune that the blond assassin whistles as she walks down the hospital corridor gets stuck in your head and as soon as you start whistling it, it spreads to anyone else who has seen the movie.
Part of this movie's charm is the constant challenge of keeping track of the timeline.  You keep thinking to yourself, ""Ok, this scene takes place before the previous scene, but after the next scene.""  Enough said.  Great movie.  Go see it if you don't mind purposely excessive amounts of blood spurting.",1074816000,5,999,4.734104046242774
1415510,5,B00005AQ65,"this is one of the best action movies I've ever seen (if not the best), Tarantino YOU ARE A GENIOUS, this is a movie that has it all, and every actor was perfectly selected for his role! Guys this is a MUST SEE movie!
Tarantino, THANKS MAN,,AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!",1074470400,4,268,4.173076923076923
1415511,5,B00005AQ65,This is the single greatest movie ever made. It certainly is the best I have ever seen. Tarantino is a genious. Uma was perfect for the role and so was everyone else. Everything worked perfectly. I was blown away. Everyone should see this movie. It would be a crime not to.,1073865600,3,273,4.372549019607843
1415512,5,B00005AQ65,"I in all my life has a movie goer, i have only been surprised twice. The first is when Hally Berry stared in BOND. And the second is seeing UMA THURMA in a yellow Bruce Lee jump suit in kill Bill. Kill bill is possible one of the greatest action movie i have ever seen. For me it is a cross between old Bruce Lee movies i growned up watching. And a new generation of kick ass female action movie stars with brains. And if the kickass  female or the brains don't get you lets try this for size, kill bill have a great plot. The one thing that set this movie off from the rest of the female action movie is that their are no breainless or half naked female trying to convince the rest of us they are out to save the world. At the end of volume1 i wanted to set in my seat and wait till volume 2 came out. The only problem i have with the movie is i wish if they had publized it more. I who knows about all the hottes movie almose miss the hottest one of them all. With all that aside i loved this movie as much as i loved lotr movies. So kick the three angel girls to the side and go for the mother from hell in a yellow jump suit in KILL BILL.",1073692800,3,1142,3.8389830508474576
1415513,5,B00005AQ65,"A lot of people flocked to the theaters to see Quentin Tarintino's 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' and why not? It's excellent! The action is outstanding the visuals are amazing, and the film just makes you want to root for the good guy (woman, actually). Rooting for the bad guy is a feat that Tarintino's knows all too well. All three of his previous films had the exact same thing. You root for them because QT can make loveable characters out of street thugs. This is not the case with Vol. 1. Nor will it be the case with Volume 2. Onto Volume 2...I read the script (which who hasn't?) and I absolutely loved it. Volume 2 will tie up Volume 1 and end the film(s). It has a great action and a great ending. Script-wise, this film should be better than Volume 1, which seems to be hard to beat. In a year where actions films were basically duds (check out Bad Boys II) we can say there was Kill Bill atleast.",1071878400,2,901,4.244186046511628
1415514,5,B00005AQ65,"This is the best movie in years, dare I say ever.  It is amazing and Uma Thurman is perfect.  I now hate myself for doubting her in such a role.  Volume 2 is going to be amazing and I will be sad that one of the best movies of all time is over.  Peace.
PS. If you don't like this movie it's because you are blinded by the violence and your opinion is invalid... so sorry.",1071705600,4,371,3.8421052631578947
1415545,5,B00005AQ65,"I've never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's works. I saw him as an actor in From Dusk Till Dawn, and I saw bits and pieces of Pulp Fiction. I sat down to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 from start to finish and was disgusted.

Then I sat down to watch this and WOW. Someone said that Tarantino intended to make one movie, but this truly feels like he made this into two movies all along. One was a Japanese revenge flick with an Anime element to it. Two is considered more of a Western, and I'm more inclined to watch a good Western.

Taking place after the events of Kill Bill Vol 1, this one adds some light to the massacre that led to the Bride seeking revenge on assassin squad leader Bill. It wasn't as straight up kill, but a fact finding mission that led to a highly exaggerated conclusion. Bride takes on the last two names prior to taking on Bill. Bill's washed up brother Budd, and the twisted and leggy Elle. Finally Bill. That conclusion was so well written and yet so unexpected. I am truly convinced that now that I've seen Tarantino's works, that I have an idea of his worst but also at his best. And this movie is truly one of his best.

Uma Thurman is not the strongest of actresses, but she does a great job with a great script. Tarantino can make anyone shine, and David Carrradine, a man who's career was defined from the Kung-Fu series in the 1970's fizzled after so many years was reignited to great success as the spurned, former lover of the Bride. The movie has great action, good use of music and some wonderful scenery. Truly a great movie and I'm glad to have it on Blu-Ray.

Great. A-",1517529600,,1603,4.2631578947368425

1415565,3,B00005AQ65,I just watched this last night.  I remember I thought I liked the first one better.  But now that this is fresh on my mind I think I like it better.  It flashes back t the beginning when everyone got killed at the wedding.  This one is less violent and the situations are less impossible.  Except for Uma Thurman digging her way out of her grave.  And I love the way Michael Madsen dies.  After recovering from all the things that she went through.  I didn't think that Bill was really dead and that they were setting it up for a vol. 3.

1415582,5,B00005AQ65,"***This review is for the blu ray*** Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues the story of revenge for the Bride, and her pursuit of Bill. While I give Vol. 1 the slight edge in terms of action, suspense, and overall aesthetic, it's immaterial, because these two films go together as one very satisfying experience. This film is a bit slower in pace, but there's still a lot to like. Disturbing at times (such as being buried alive), it never ceases to amaze in its effect. Uma Thurman carries out her role in spectacular fashion, bringing forth an array of emotions not in abundance in action films that have a simple plot. I highly recommend this second piece of Kill Bill. The special features are good as usual. The blu ray itself is of pristine sound and picture quality.",1488240000,,762,4.569343065693431

1415684,4,B00005AQ65,"Released in 2004 and directed by Tarantino, Kill Bill Vol. 2 completes the story of 2003s Vol. 1 and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fianc & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.

This is decidedly more dialogue-driven than Vol. 1 which makes it slightly less effective. Dont get me wrong, I value good dialogue and the verbiage is generally amusing here; and I guess it fleshes-out the characters. But the problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and criminal assassins to boot. So its impossible to give them more depth, at least as far as understanding them and caring for them goes. Let em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and wouldve been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, at the most.

Still, the movies so offbeat that its entertaining in the manner of 1996s Mojave Moon. Its an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70s martial arts flicks, James Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the Kill Bill flicks are cinematic masterpieces of phenomenal auteurism is Exhibit A in The Emperor's New Clothes. Take the ridiculous closing credits, for instance, which run well over 12 minutes. The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. Still, the movies strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and the superman analysis is insightful.

The movie runs 137 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Beijing, China; and Mexico.

1415752,4,B00005AQ65,"I've seen Kill Bill 1 as well, and really, the review needs to be about both films in this
story of revenge. The story was cut up into two movies.

The second film was brilliant in terms of plot and writing, in that there was not the
Typical Western film letdown. Many movies and novels build atmosphere, but nearing
the end of the story they give in to plot demands and end badly. This does not
Happen in Kill Bill 2.

Martial artists will enjoy this film, due to the flashback into the martial art training of
The protagonist (played by Uma Thurman).",1475884800,,552,4.349514563106796

The movie as a whole seemed to flow together a bit better than in Volume 1.  The exceedingly bloody scenes in Volume 1 are fortunately missing in Volume 2.  Not the first time I have watched; won't be the last.  I just need to be in the mood for some good, mindless violence (without comedy).  The only real negative is that it is hard to root for anyone in these movies; they are all contract killers.  Personally I like to have a hero (or heroine) who is a ""good"" person, and an assassin doesn't qualify.",1475452800,,611,4.353982300884955

Didn't think it could get worse than volume 1, but Tarantino doesn't disappoint at all on letting you down scene after scene - just wretch worthy that you can tell he is so high on himself to create such an awful film, let alone managed to get this refuse produced.

Same assertion that homosexual criminal gangs, perpetrating cultural genocide against heteros, pretend as a basis for their prepubescent retard refusal to relate to anyone not of their own gender, relying on criminally corrupt goofermint to homosexually regiment all young people including compulsory same gender bedroom partners in institutions of ""higher education"".  Beatrix wanted to leave and the rest was the story told in this pair of moo bees.  Not that motherhood is any demonstration of heterosexuality.  More often it is a pretext for avoiding hetero relationships.  But the story was about wanting to leave the criminal gang, not about motherhood.

It was also made in a way I wouldn't believe true assassin who are smart enough to out wit society to do there highly illegal jobs would be so stupid to do! An Assassin lady going up against one person she knows is a trained & successful assassin would be so stupid after seeing signs that he may be on to her that she's going to run through the front door with nothing more then a sword? Come on!, An ancient master that's dumb enough to keep a student around that he punished with physical & permanent harm? Give me a break! I did like the point of the little girl, daughter of to murders almost having it inborn to murder, I felt there was a lot to it. Thought it was kind of similar to Kung fu Panda in a way that she was able to pick up all the secrets of the master that no one else got or was taught.

I would say Tarantino was blinded by his regard (obsession?) for his star. Much like Francis Ford Coppola couldn't see how awful his daughter was in the God Father III, Tarantino missed Thurman's flaws, and missteps. If the Director had been more like the movie's heroine, and been willing to cut down that which he loved when it was time, this movie may have been saved.

Sometimes I wish that I could give a movie 0 stars, but that is not the case here. For all it's flaws, Kill Bill has some redeeming moments, and deserved the one star.",1446163200,,711,4.427480916030534

1416180,5,B00005AQ65,"This second installment of the 'Kill Bill' series has ""The Bride"" continuing on her rampage of revenge with
a few twists and turns. Volume 2 was released about 4 months after Volume One. The two were originally
slated to be one long film but Tarantino was convinced to chop it into two parts.

If you have not seen the first film don't bother with this one. As a matter of fact attempt to watch both in
succession if you can muster the stamina. Both films move along a fairly brisk pace most of the time and
are essentially one film. Together they are about 4 hours in length.

The second one seems to be more talky and less action than the first but that works well. It  does not drag
or become boring. You will move deeper into the connections of the characters eventually landing on Bill's
door step and the final confrontation.

Again Tarantino uses an eclectic range of music to help with the mood of the film. He uses country music
as well as selections from Ennio Morricone's western films, the 'Ironside' theme, and at the end, a rock 'n'
roll version of a traditional Mexican song. Eclectic indeed. The music all works well to help underscore the
mood of the scene or scenes. Mr. Tarantino's selection of music is a forte of his.

Uma Thurman (The Bride) was nominated for A Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and David Carradine
(Bill) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. If you have seen any old 'B' movies that this film emulates
you will understand how well acted the movie is; all players included.

If you disliked Volume 1 don't bother with Volume 2. It has all the same wonderful direction, music, acting
and script that originated from Volume 1.  You are not going to see an improved film or a different film but
the film that will let you have fun and be entertained all the way to the finale.

5 more stars for Kill Bill Volume 2 for a total of Ten Stars for both films. Overkill? Yes, but so is the plot and
the body-count. Have fun with this one and make sure you put plenty of real butter on that pop corn.",1441843200,,2035,4.3936170212765955

We see how Beatrice develops into a killer and what caused her to betray her mentor  and humanizing reaction from one of her attackers.  I like how in a short time you feel you know the characters, they are developed more by the great acting and backstory given to them.  This rounding out of characters as real people occurs in the first movie, but the reduction in unneccesary dismemberment lets you pay attention more to he story and acting.",1441584000,3,582,4.611650485436893

What I did like was her training with Pai Mei, who was so formidable.  Beatrice thought nothing of her training until she had to start training. She becomes so broken down, she can barely eat.  But she begins to earn his approval.

QT often adds at least one blooper in credits like many Asian martial arts movies do. You get more better in the extras too.
Qts stuff gets reviewed to death. I bought it , OK?
I notice that Uma has an entirely different quality of beauty when viewed relaxed from a few inches above. Rather like a Bridget Fonda look. It's almost startling when you see it. A real actors' face, different personas almost from different angles.

1416668,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill is not a mere display of nicely-choreographed violence. It's not obvious in Vol1, but Vol2 shows us that all the killings are essentially from the power-shift struggle between Bill and Beatrix, lovers and master-protege.

A forced journey for the Bride to find herself, admitting that 'killing feels good'. Killing is more than a job to her, as Bill pointed out in the final interrogation. Not being able to face this fact would be a weakness in her normal life.

Desired life earned. The bride now deserves the life away from the assassin gig. If her escape plan succeeded, she would have appeared a bit cowardly, not a rebel against the DiVAS group and their godfather, and against the dominating lover.

Love out of admiration sealed. Bill and Beatrix still admire one another, but the love is poisoned by the bullets and sword-wielding. And with the struggle for control over life, they can't just reconcile. They could have used some nice long talk before started hurting each other and pushing each other further apart. The talk might be hard to get to anywhere, but better than a killing rampage. Bill eventually took a step back in this fight, willingly and unwillingly. Guess some relationships are not meant to be 'happy ever after'.

Not sure what Bill did makes Hanzo hate him so much. One take-home note though: when lovers fight, try to not get involved.",1407110400,,1378,4.826271186440678

Our heroine, Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) has just been blasted away a few times, once being set up in the chapel by Bill (David Carradine) and once a trailer by Budd (Michael Madsen), only to be buried alive and eventually escape.

Once again plotting revenge on those who've made her mad, Beatrix goes on yet another rampage of Quintin Tarantino directed gore.  To say this movie is campy is giving campy a bad rep.  This movie is odd, period.  But in its oddness is true greatness.  Face it, as an estimated $30 million budget, it returned nearly all of it in the U.S. alone during the opening weekend.

Michael Madsen is taken care of for her - in a most dastardly way by Darryl Hannah. And then follows the greatest girl on girl samurai sword fight of all time, done in a confined double wide trailer (slightly reminiscent of the fight between John Goodman and Cage in Raising Arizona in Cage's trailer from 7 years earlier but oh well)... we see her training with her sadistic Kung Fu master, her escape from being buried alive, the massacre at her wedding which is only alluded to in part 1, and finally finding Bill and her daughter. The sound track really makes the parody work (and it is pretty much a parody of over the top Kung Fu films), lots of hair raising action and an hysterical 5 minute cameo by Larry Bishop.

1416798,5,B00005AQ65,"Maybe not as groundbreaking as ""Resevoir Dogs,"" or as good a movie as ""Pulp Fiction,"" but who else could make an epic kung fu spaghetti western? Partly homage, partly something new, who else could write parts for Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu and make them this engaging? He plays on the stereotypes, but uses a mom as his main character? He dredges up old burned out actors (Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah) and rebuilds them like the six million dollar man (better, faster, stronger).

Uma's great in the role; probably Carradine's best performance. Lots of violence, eye-plucking, etc, so be aware of that. But the training scenes with Gordon Liu are classic and I cheered as she escapes the grave. ;) A little anti-climatic, but the final scene with Thurman and Carradine is gold.

To some it was a ripoff as part 2 to any action series is supposed to have equal or more action. This one had far less and more story. I say it was an ok movie (3 stars) and if it was the only movie in the series, I would give it 3 and a half stars. But it was disappointing in respect to part 1 (especially the last scene with Bill).

For a gang of global assassins the crew didn't seem to be all the stealthy; it was like everyone was predictable. Perhaps Quintin wanted it that way and we the audience came to see how it play out.

Okay, so to be fair, the first movie was kind of over the top and fun in that sense,
but this movie was all tension, all badass, and a killer expositional piece in the story.

The pacing was great, and the dialogue was AWESOME. I'd say this script is probably
on a similar level with Inglorious Bastards, but a few notches below Pulp Fiction.

As stated in my review of Vol. 1, information and build-up was missing, but this movie
delivered it, and it was perfect.

Now once again, I find myself ripping on a movie that a very large percent of people love, and to be completely honest,
I hold to my opinion that this movie, while necessary to the story, is an improvement over the first installment

And for the Bottom Line, I will say Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an;

89%- Unquestionably better than Vol. 1, but still relevant, Vol. 2 is filled with nuances that only re-assert
Tarantino's talent as a filmmaker, and is a great conclusion to an epic and well written story.",1397260800,,1044,4.439790575916231

There's no denying that they're well cast, well shot and edited, and that there are some clever bits and lines of dialogue. However, they're still oddly bad and good at the same time. The characters do inexplicably dumb things, like the Bride charging into the Budd's trailer without taking into account that he might get the drop on her with his shotgun and Budd's convoluted means of killing the Bride by burying her alive. Why not just blast her head off with the shotgun and have done with it? Everything is set up so that the Bride winds up killing Bill and his band of assassins, but not in a way that feels organic or well planned, either on offense or defense. I also wound up dozing through much of Bill's dialogue prior to the Bride finishing him off. I just didn't care anymore what happened to any of these strange characters. Earlier Tarantino movies, ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were more cohesive narratives. I'll give the ""Kill Bill"" movies three stars for the cinematography, editing, casting and fight choreography, but no more than that.",1397260800,,1169,4.679611650485437

1417073,5,B00005AQ65,"This is the second half of Quinton Taranto's ""pulp fiction"" masterpiece of revenge.
The movie is pulp fiction purposely in its superficial characters and clichd story line.  However, the execution of those characters and story is so engrossing, so raw in entertainment and excitement that the viewer is riveted continuously.  Taranto's genius is his ability to get us to have strong emotional reactions to his characters and situations of story.  His dialogue alone is so intriguing, so captivating that one will enjoy the movie on that issue along with the others.

Of course, see both parts one after the other;  just lock the doors, turn off the phone, and become immersed.  This is Hollywood movie enjoyment at its peak, vastly above the embarrassingly simplistic and boring ""tween's"" movies pumped out today to the last category of people with money to spend going to the movies.

1417090,5,B00005AQ65,"Like Kill Bill vol 1, this is a movie going into it that it will be ultra violent.  Where the first was over-the-top almost campy with the action and violence, this is not that way.  There are definitely a couple really good fight scenes, but the things are more real in this one than the first.  There is no spraying blood dismembering, or crazy stunts done with wires (save for a couple).  While it does take some suspension of disbelief to accept everything that happens, this is far more of an action/drama than the first one was.

This volume lays out the entire back story of what lead up to the attack we see bits and pieces of in the first movie.  It also puts The Bride in real peril, both physical and emotional as the movie goes along.  The confrontation with Bill is almost all dialogue, and about 45 seconds of an actual fight scene, but it works perfectly.  To the extent that Bill could be made sympathetic in any way for what he did, the writing and David Carradine's performance pulled that off.  He balanced an almost easy going nature with a sinister one perfectly.  Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen get a lot of screen time in this one, much more than Vivica Fox and Lucy Lui got in the first movie.  The fight scene between Elle and The Bride was certainly the high point of the movie action wise.

Ultimately whether you like this or not, is really going to depend on your taste.  The movie definitely earns its R rating.  If you like Tarantino's other movies, chances are you are going to like this one.  If bad language and violence are not up your alley, then you probably want to stay away.",1374969600,,1615,4.408783783783784

1417096,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill Volume Two is an excellent movie.  I enjoy it more than volume one.  The story is much better told as we are able to understand the reasons for Uma Thurman's success in killing Bill.  She has trained with a martial arts master and she is using that training to make her way to Bill.  She kills Bill at the end, and that much is obvious.  However, the reality is that she had long since killed Bill.  In the final scene Thurman's character uses the Five Point Exploding Heart Technique to devastating effect on Bill.  After five steps he dies from a heart that exploded.  The Five Point Exploding Heart Technique is actually a symbol for Thurman crushing Bill's heart at the time that she left him in order to keep her unborn child away from a life of crime.  The viewer learns of the technique earlier in the movie, and it reappears at the end to make the statement that this woman had long ago killed Bill.

Tarantino is in effect relating an age old tale of the damage a woman may cause when she exits your life.  Your heart explodes in a sense; an excellent way to tell the tale of man's broken heart.",1372809600,,1114,4.333333333333333

1417107,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill Vol. II is a very different film than Vol. I. This film has a completely different mood. There is more attention spent on relations between some of the characters. There is less humor here, but still plenty to keep you giggling. There is also a lot less violence here as well, yet enough to satisfy the blood thirst of some of us. The real treat here is a superb performance by David Carradine. This is his shining moment, and he deserved at least an academy award nomination for a truly wonderful and remarkable performance. There is also a segment that is pretty much the most horrifying and unsettling ""Buried alive"" scene possibly ever shot. Kill Bill Vol. II isn't at all an average film, on the contrary, it's a super slick and excellent Tarantino movie, but not as over the top, not as exciting, not as action packed as Vol. I. Both of these films are really better than 80% of the movies made over the past few years, and this one is good enough to make you want to see it again. There is also a very memorable performance here from Michael Parks who plays two different characters in this movie. His portrayal of the owner of a Mexican bordello is truly incredible and humorous. Neither of the films in the Kill Bill series are as good as Pulp Fiction but they come sort of close, and I have no doubt that Quentin Tarantino has yet to make his best film. He's given us 3 others since, but his true masterpeice I think is yet to come. It may be another decade or so before he does, but he is certainly going to make one eventually that may very well top Pulp Fiction and maybe with a little luck this yet to be made picture will grab a best picture Oscar. Until then we have some excellent Tarantino movies to enjoy, and Kill Bill Vol. II is certainly one of the best.",1371772800,,1786,4.334328358208955

THe story is waylayed several times by flashbacks, but the story being told form behind is engaging and interesting - Pai Mei is a great character, and almost inspired my brother to grow his eyebrows and beard out just to try and mimic the awesomeness that is his fumanchu style.

My only beef with this movie is that it builds dramatically, constantly bouncing back and forth between Bill, the Bride, and their past, but when the final fight finally comes, and they spend a dreamy few hours as an almost normal family, it leaves me wanting.

Volume 2 on the other hand is more plot driven and less action but still has mutiple action scenes the scene with the fighting between the main character and another woman in Budd's trailer.  The other scene is when she is being trainned by the master ontop of the temple.  What did it for me though is the character trying to find out if her daughter is still alive and find a way to kill Bill.  When it gets to be face to face she is shock beyond anything and left speechless when she finds Bill and the surpise he has for her.  So overall this is a great movie to watch the first one being about 2 hours, and the second movie being about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  So if you like the director's style of writting and directing then pick this movie up for the action, plotline, drama, and pure intensity of a determined woman getting her revenge on a man who tried to kill her.",1355961600,,1033,4.135

1417201,5,B00005AQ65,"According to IMBD, on Kill Bill Volume 2 (For Information Purposes), During the opening credits, we see the Bride's bloodied face again and hear her say ""Bill, it's your baby."" In the first scene, we see her driving an open car and saying that there is only one left to kill (which answers the question whether she believed that Elle died). She is on her way to Bill.

Chapter 6: The Massacre at Two Pines

Back at the beginning (a black-and-white segment), at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel in El Paso, TX, a dress rehearsal for a wedding is taking place. Reverend Harmony (Bo Svenson) and his wife (Jeannie Epper) decide that, since the bride will have no relatives present at the wedding, the groom's relatives and friends can sit on both sides of the aisle. The Bride (Uma Thurman) leaves the chapel to get some fresh air; on the way out, she is disturbed to hear flute music. On the front porch she finds Bill (David Carradine) sitting on a bench playing his bamboo flute. She asks him to be nice and he replies that he does not know how to be nice but will do his best to be sweet. They enter the hall and she introduces Bill to her fianc as her father but rejects the fianc's idea that, as her father, he should give her away at the ceremony. As the bride and groom are called to the front by the Reverend Harmony, no attempt is made to introduce 'father' to the rest of the fianc's family. Bill stays at the back of the chapel.

Outside the chapel, four armed assassins appear, all dressed in black. In one line they move to the door, they enter, and the shooting starts, killing everybody inside except for the Bride and Bill.

Back in the present (in color), Bill visits his younger brother Budd (Michael Madsen), a.k.a. Sidewinder, at his trailer in the middle of nowhere and warns him about the Bride. She will kill Budd if Budd does not allow Bill to protect him. They had differences in the past but they should move on. Budd, drinking as they talk, replies that maybe they should get killed because the Bride deserves her revenge. He then infuriates Bill by saying that he pawned his priceless samurai sword (a gift from Bill) for $250.

Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula Schulz

Budd goes to work. He works as a bouncer in a local strip club. He arrives 20 minutes late and sees that there are no customers in the club. He talks briefly with the bartender, Jay, before he is called into the office by his hot-tempered, coke-snorting boss Larry Gomez. In the office, Larry argues with Budd over being late again, and Budd talks back, saying that there is nobody in the bar & there was no need for him to be there. Larry takes away all Budd's scheduled hours and tells him in a rude tone not to come back to work until he hears from him. In the bar, Budd agrees to clean up after a broken toilet that a stripper named Rockets says is overflowing.

Budd returns to his trailer but standing in front of it suddenly freezes. He enters the trailer but looks out the window. The Bride, who was hiding under the trailer, sticks to the wall so he does not see her. When she opens the door Budd shoots her in the chest with a shotgun loaded with rock salt. While she lies wounded on the ground, Budd is very pleased with himself and injects her with a sedative. He phones Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and offers to sell her the Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword for a million dollars. Elle agrees to bring the money in the morning. Her condition is that the Bride must die and suffer to her last breath.

Budd and an accomplice of his dig a large hole in the ground at a local cemetery to bury the wounded Bride alive. When the grave has been dug, the Bride is given a choice: if she does not resist, she'll be given a flashlight; if she does, Budd will burn out her eyes with mace and leave her buried alive in darkness. She chooses the flashlight, is put in a coffin and the lid is nailed down. Budd and his accomplice lower the coffin into the ground and cover it with soil. The Bride panics for a short time and recalls her training under Pai Mei.

Chapter 8: The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei

In a flashback, Bill and the Bride (very much in love with him) sit by a campfire somewhere in China and Bill, who calls her ""kiddo,"" plays his flute. He tells her about his kung fu teacher Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu, credited as Gordon Liu) and his 'five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique.' The technique involves five blows administered to particular pressure points on the body. Thereafter, the victim's heart explodes after he or she takes five steps. Pai Mei did not teach Bill the technique because he does not show it to anyone.

At the foot of the steps leading to Pai Mei's place in another part of rural China, Bill, who has just come down, informs the Bride that Pai Mei will take her as his pupil because he is lonely. Bill's bruised face shows that he was hurt but he refuses to say what happened. Bill warns her not to show any disrespect or disobedience to Pai Mei because Pai Mei will kill her -- ""he hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women."" She climbs the steps and quickly is humiliated by Pai Mei, who scorns her fighting skills and her ethnicity. He challenges her to land one blow on him while they engage in hand-to-hand combat and the Bride fails. Pai Mei threatens to chop her hand off with a single blow and declares that her hand belongs to him and she must strengthen it. Over the next several weeks, the Bride works hard (practicing martial arts forms and bringing buckets of water up the steps) and learns hard. She finds striking a blow with her fist to break a hole through a thick wooden plank at close range the most difficult skill.

Back to the present. Still inside the coffin, the Bride manages to remove her boots and the belt tying her feet together. She takes out a straight razor hidden in her boot and uses it to cut her hands free. She hits the coffin lid with her fist repeatedly. The lid becomes smeared with her blood but it finally cracks. She appears to swim up through the earth, and an arm emerges from the grave. The Bride crawls out. Covered in dirt, she walks into a diner, sits down and calmly asks for a glass of water.

Chapter 9: Elle and I

The Bride walks a great distance across the desert and through the mountains. She reaches Budd's trailer in time to see Elle arrive.

Elle enters the trailer and gives Budd a red suitcase full of money. He makes margaritas in a grubby blender and serves them in dirty jelly-jar glasses while she examines the sword. He opens the suitcase, gloats over the money, and is struck in the face by a venomous black mamba snake that was hidden among the bundles of cash. Before he dies, Elle tells him that she is sorry that such a ""piece of shit"" as himself was the one who managed to kill the Bride -- she deserved better. She phones Bill and tells him that the Bride has killed his brother but that she, Elle, has killed the Bride. Elle also reveals the whereabouts of the final resting place of the Bride (in the grave of Paula Schulz) and mentions the Bride's real name for the first time: Beatrix Kiddo.

Beatrix walks in and immediately attacks Elle. Their long and vicious fight destroys the trailer's interior. In a lull in the hostilities, Beatrix asks Elle how she lost her eye and Elle says that Pai Mei ripped it out because she offended him. Elle tells Beatrix that she poisoned Pai Mei in revenge and he died. They continue to fight and Elle gets hold of the Bride's sword. In a golf bag, the Bride finds another katana, inscribed ""To my brother Budd, the only man I ever loved, Bill"" -- apparently Budd did not sell it after all. As they face off, Elle relishes the irony of killing the Bride with her own sword. However, at close range, the Bride plucks out Elle's remaining eye and steps on it. Rather than finish killing Elle, Beatrix leaves the trailer, the black mamba hissing behind her as Elle shrieks and curses and flails.

Last Chapter: Face to Face

In Mexico, the Bride visits the courtly retired pimp Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks), Bill's old mentor, and asks him to tell her where Bill is. He finally agrees because he thinks Bill would surely like to see her.

She enters Bill's hacienda carefully, a gun in her hand, but is shocked to the point of tears when Bill and their small daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine), alive, both play-shoot at her with toy guns. She spends good time with her daughter, who falls asleep. The Bride goes to speak to Bill.

Bill's warning shot pins Beatrix down in her seat, then he shoots her with a truth-serum dart. She explains why she left him: because she wanted to keep their child safe, not wanting her to grow up to be assassins like them.

Flashback to a hotel room: the Bride, who's been sent on an assassination assignment to Japan, discovers that she is pregnant. Another assassin, Karen Kim (Helen Kim), shoots a hole in the door with a shotgun. The Bride, pointing her gun at Karen, convinces her that she is pregnant and persuades her to walk away, promising that she will do the same. As she leaves, Karen congratulates the Bride.

Back in the present, Bill is puzzled because he believes that Beatrix is a natural born killer and could not change. He asks if she enjoyed killing the other people on her revenge list, and the truth serum forces her to admit that she did. They agree to fight with swords on the beach -- then Bill suddenly attacks her as they sit on his patio. At the climax of a brief skirmish during which both remain seated, she strikes him with the five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique. She tells Bill that she did not mention that Pai Mei taught her the technique because she is a bad person. Bill disputes that. They share an affectionate farewell before he takes five steps and falls down dead.

Beatrix takes her daughter away to start a new life: ""The lioness has rejoined her cub, and all is right in the jungle.""",1354838400,,9945,4.4402412280701755

The second was closer to a serious drama, with a lot more character development. I had expected the comic book splatter to simply continue for another two hours...

Part of me was disappointed, another part actually liked ""Volume 2"" better. My more serious side, perhaps?

But sure, the concluding part of Tarantino's inimitable epic does have its fair share of mayhem, including murder by black mamba, poisoned fish or kung fu. Best character: Samuel L. Jackson as an obscure jazz player, visible for only two or three minutes. LOL. Fresh out of ""True Romance"", I imagine.

Otherwise, I admit the complete disconnect between the spaghetti western music and the actual plot was also to my liking...

Where as Volume 1 had over the top violence, there's an undercurrent of menace in Volume 2.  The Bride reminds everyone that she's going after Bill, her ex-employer/ex-lover, who, along with her ex-colleagues, tried to kill her at her wedding rehearsal.  The Bride takes a moment to herself during the rehearsal to get away from the minister's annoying wife and finds Bill sitting outside.  Bill (played to smooth, chilled perfection by David Carradine) seems like an affable guy (though by now you know he'd put a bullet in a pregnant woman's skull) with hippie-ish tendencies.  Later on he reveals a geeky side (waxing poetic on Superman comics) and a paternal facade.  All throughout though, you know just how ruthless he is when someone crosses him.

Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is Salieri to the Bride's Mozart (at least as portrayed in ""Amadeus"").  Jealous and conniving, she is not only intent on taking out the Bride but anyone who dares steal that honor for themselves.  Michael Madsen is amazing as Bill's estranged, younger brother, Budd.  A drunk, he's the only former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad that seems to not have a comfortable living.  He's living in a trailer, working as a bouncer/janitor at a third-rate strip club.  He's also the only one of the DeVAS (including the Bride) who expresses any real regret about his past.  Bill visits him, having learned of the deaths of 2 of the DeVAS, and offers his assistance.  Budd turns him down, almost seeming to accept a fate he feels is deserved.  However, he's got something up his sleeve.

As always, Tarantino's use of music is on par with other great directors.  He draws on a variety of genres, though this film relies heavily on musical cues drawn from Westerns (American or otherwise)

If there is one criticism I have is that the films drags toward the end.  Yes, we see how the Bride became such an effective killer, but I would have rather have learned more about Bill.

Tarantino indicts us all, the audience, for rooting for the Bride by reminding us that we're not on the side of some innocent.  She is an assassin and her becoming a mother doesn't wash away all her sins.  Fans of the film have since wondered whether we'll ever get a sequel involving someone, a true innocent, seeking revenge against the Bride herself.",1339286400,3,2333,4.775

Along the way, we catch a glimpse at her training in a stereotypically isolated Japanese temple, alongside an impishly charismatic bearded master, the show-stealing Pai Mei. When it comes time for the inevitable showdown with Bill himself, Tarantino plays his trump card and leaves a driven audience (and vengeful bride) confused about the apparent simplicity of their quest of the last four-plus hours. It's not as instantly captivating as the first package, and a few segments fall curiously flat, but it's enjoyable in surprising new ways and provides the closure we were all so desperate for.

This isn't a sequel to 'Vol. 1', as he didn't decide to split 'Kill Bill' up until just after he finished shooting, it's simply the second half. 'Vol. 1' is an excellent, excellent film, but no where in the range of this one. I grin ear-to-ear all the way through this movie.

This is Quentin's most visually beautiful movie yet (and the magnificent opening chapter in the chapel, shot in gleaming black-and-white, is profoundly resplendent, as is the great sequence at Pai Mei's ancient abode, shot in gloriously seventies-style over-saturated greens and glaring whites), and it's where his flair for spaghetti-Westerns comes out the most; the majority of the movie is vintage Wild West. As in all of Tarantino's films, the dialogue is an unadulterated joy, and there's actually relatively little of it here, nearly all of it spoken slowly and ponderously, much of it philosophically, as befits a movie with this Western setting. The way the characters each savor and weigh their words is one of the best aspects of the film; Quentin has never written dialogue as lastingly satisfying as this.

In a beautiful scene that grins at us with delight (as is Tarantino's wont), the Bride tracks down a father-figure of Bill's to learn his location, and he tells her a story about taking him to a movie as a little boy, at which he learned what type of women Bill 'was a fool for', even at that age. We learn from this brief story the fancy Bill always had that first attracted him to the Bride long before the 'Kill Bill' story began. Where so many movies would give us a disturbing childhood story explaining how the villain became that way, Quentin gives us one about a likable, positive trait that reminds us of his humanity, just before our heroine confronts him.

'Vol. 2' is nearly his least violent film yet, and I've read both the original script and David Carradine's 'The Kill Bill Diaries', about all he saw of the making of the movies, and it's clear that many of Quentin's best decisions had to do with diminishing or removing the action. In place of the more obvious strategy of showing us a detailed sequence of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad gruesomely gunning down the people in the chapel, he decided no, pull back and let us just listen to a brief event from a distance, observing it in a kind of silhouette. And in place of Bill firing a warning shot at the Bride and holding her at gun-point while she walks towards a couch to seat herself, he decided Bill simply regards her casually, his pistol just visible at his waist, of which they are both aware. In the earlier idea, all suspense would have been spent with the warning shot. When Bill relates the tale of Pai Mei to the Bride, he decided it would be more effective to let us use our imaginations while listening to Bill's ponderous speech by the camp-fire in the dark than to play seventies Kung Fu footage of Pai Mei in action over the monologue.

The first time I saw the movie, the first big thing that struck me was Budd, one of the Bride's three remaining targets. His is a great and tragic character, and Michael Madsen is a great actor. His performance begins in a singularly perfect scene with Carradine which shows us his indifference to, and acceptance of, his approaching probable demise. And for a long stretch the Bride is forgotten, and we simply follow Budd into the lonely strip club he tends bar at, getting a taste of what his existence has become, of his disappointment and withdrawal from life (the scene where he argues with his boss Larry and finally relinquishes both his hat and his pride is worthy of applause). Every time I watch the scene of the Bride's sneak-attack on him, I am more amazed by how exquisitely constructed the whole sequence is. A long, meticulous build-up ending in unexpected truncation is a trade-mark of Quentin's, in activity as well as dialogue. What Budd does with the Bride is endlessly fascinating to me in its brilliant, terrifying, primeval simplicity. This is the stuff of great myths.

A while ago I realized I can't truly cherish movies, even great ones, that zip right along, whose scenes each seem to exist mostly to set the next scene up. 'Vol. 2', and for that matter, all of Quentin's movies, allow us to inhabit its scenes' settings, their situations, their characters, their moods. The scenes in this movie are each genuine, distinct places to me. Discussing his 'Jackie Brown', Tarantino said that for a film to last beyond its theatrical run, its scenes need to have substance in themselves and can't only be about that specific film's plot, as you pretty much get that the first time around. He said people often wonder why 'Jackie' has so many 'hang-around' scenes, in which the characters just hang around and talk to each other - scenes about the characters, about great dialogue. He believes those are crucial in bringing people back to a film for the sixth, the seventh, the fiftieth times. What happens when Elle visits Budd when all seems to be finished? They hang out for a while. What basically happens for most of the Bride's stay at Bill's residence? They hang out.

In the last chapter the tone of the film changes from the grandiose, Tarantinian adventure of the first four chapters - in which almost godlike characters imprison, and barter, and betray, and apprentice, and battle each other, and do great deeds, and in which much depends on who possesses the Bride's unequalled Hanzo sword - and settles into an intimate dialogue between the story's two central characters (and one other, for a time), in which Quentin subtly and expertly simmers the tension and danger that exists between these two supremely deadly assassins. This section of the film is in keeping with an other trade-mark of Quentin's, that of inserting elements of simplest, uttermost reality into an over-the-top, epic story. With Quentin's help, David Carradine produced a deliriously great performance in this film, as a man who is possibly even more laid-back than Carradine was himself, but who can be deeply, genuinely menacing. In the last chapter, he delivers two of the movie's best speeches, one about the death of a goldfish, the other about his favorite superhero.

'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is the most joyful, the most exciting, the most glorious celebration of the cinema I've ever seen. It is Tarantino's deepest and most emotionally powerful film by far (and the often over-looked sequence of the Bride slowly preparing herself before leaving a bed-room to face Bill is one of the very best in the film) and during an autoexcavation it has one of the very best uses of music I've heard in a movie. The climax of the Bride's raggedly magnificent confrontation with her wicked rival Elle evokes in me the emotion of sheer love. And the scene of the Bride's triumph over the designs of Budd has become one of my central images of the cinema. This film is a human object and it radiates its director's signature passion and love of the movies. Roger Ebert once said that 'The Third Man' is 'the film that most perfectly embodies the romance of going to the movies', or it is for him at least. For me, it's this one.",1294185600,2,7520,4.692424242424242

This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence). It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing. On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours.

1417289,3,B00005AQ65,"KILL BILL VOLUME TWO is really the first film where Tarantino's ""all-talk-as-a-substitute-for action"" began to grow weary. In his masterful homage KILL BILL VOLUME ONE, Tarantino did something entirely different from his previous films...he went minimal on the dialogue and let the action dominate the tale; in his previous films, long scenes of dialogue would build the tension into a surprising crescendo of violence. VOLUME ONE went the opposite direction...extensive action scenes that were either interspersed with moments of levity (Bride and Vernita's fight coming to a comical halt after her daughter returns from school, the ""trix are for kids"" moment between The Bride and O'ren, The Bride stopping to whip the little Crazy 88 boy with her Hanzo sword); these were classic moments. And the dialogue in VOLUME ONE, what little there was, was immensely witty, original, snappy, and quotable. I'd say that VOLUME ONE has the most quotable dialogue of ANY Tarantino film! Sometimes, less is more. In VOLUME TWO, Tarantino goes back to his roots and this was not a good return for me.  Admittedly, the main cast (Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah) is excellent and do a great job of inhabiting their characters, but Tarantino really overdid it on the talking!

KILL BILL VOLUME TWO concludes the saga of The Bride (Thurman admirably reprising the role from ONE, but looking a lot less sexy than she was in ONE) on her quest to eliminate her fellow Deadly Viper Assassination Squad members Budd and Elle (Madsen and Hannah, who had cameos in ONE) and, of course, their leader Bill (Carradine in an assured performance). The opening scene fills in the gaps by detailing events prior to the wedding massacre. We finally get to see SEE the mercurial character Bill and Carradine's portrayal is the main reason I even remotely like this film at all. He manages to make Bill simultaneously lethal and sympathetic, an amazing feat. Actually, this opening scene and the concluding scenes with Bill are the best of the film, but everything in between is a muddled mess.

While Madsen is very good as Budd, I felt like his chapter was the weakest. That scene at the strip club where he is a bouncer was completely UNNECESSARY. It just seemed like filler with a bunch of pseudo-real, stereotypical characters: the drunk, high foul-mouthed owner (who wasn't very convincing!), the aging bitchy stripper (who came across as just a bitch!). Also, how in the heck did The Bride (who obviously did her homework, honed her skills, and used her best instincts before she approached her targets in ONE (Vernita and O'Ren) let Budd get the upper hand on her, especially given that fact that she must have KNOWN that he knew she was coming (his brother Bill told him as soon as he found out she took down O'Ren and her army). Did she just think he'd be sitting there waiting for her to slash him with her Hanzo sword?! She's smarter (or at least I thought she was!) than this. Budd's outsmarting of The Bride is another amateur Tarantino trick disguised as a realistic moment. And, remember, this film, Part TWO, is supposed to be a more ""realistic"" representation of the Kill Bill universe, the counterpoint to the fantastical Part ONE.

Then there is the Pai Mei flashback, which ties in to how she will escape her current predicament. These scenes are OK, reminiscent of the kung fu 70s movies, but they seem a bit to ""obligatory"" with all these ""cool"" moments illustrating where she learned all those moves that she executed in ONE to take down her enemies in that film. Surviving the ordeal, during which time Elle kills Budd (in a perversely funny moment), then the Bride has the showdown with Elle (and we learn The Bride's real name in the process). Then, The Bride ""magically"" shows up at the doorstep of some guy named Esteban (Michael Parks, who played Earl Macgraw in ONE) who is yet ANOTHER former mentor of Bill and HAPPENS to know where she can find him! It is at this point when I realized that Tarantino really didn't have a plot or story for this film and that everything that happens is just a convenience to serve the plot to keep the film moving to it's obvious conclusion. As hard as it was for her to conquer her enemies in ONE, in TWO, everything was just too pat to be convincing.

Of course, the concluding scene between The Bride and Bill is extremely engrossing (mainly because of Carradine) and, if the overlong middle scenes had not been so monotonous and poor, it could in some way redeem this film, but 2 strong scenes do not a great film make! Ironically, for all the dialogue and speechifying in TWO, I was much more involved with and felt I knew more about the characters in the non-talkative, dialogue-lite part ONE! The characters in ONE jumped off the screen and left a lasting impression with me...not so much in TWO. Seems like many that say that TWO is better than ONE do so simply because it happens to contain more dialogue and is delves deeper into character, but it's just a bunch of characters talking and talking and at the end of it all, we still don't really know much of anything about them. The main characters in ONE are much more interesting, including The Bride ONE trumping The Bride TWO. Part ONE is good enough for me!",1281052800,2,5285,4.7402173913043475

Well I didn't enjoy Vol 2, either, but it's because of different reasons. The second half of Tarantino's Kill Bill has a fairly simpler style, and far less pop culture references. That's the good thing, at least for me. But unfortunately, it doesn't stop me from disliking the film. The problem I have with Vol 2 is that numerous scenes are unbelievably ponderous mostly because of excessive dialogue. I don't have anything against dialogue-driven films (All The President's Men and Glengarry Glen Ross are some of my favorites that choose words over action), but the conversations in this particular film are pretty dull and uninteresting. They drag on so long that you have no choice but just sit there and wait for the fight scenes. And speaking of fight scenes, there are only fifteen minutes of fight scenes here compared to the half hour in Vol 1. You'll be sorely disappointed if you're expecting to see Uma Thurman battle dozens of swordsmen yet again. I did like the performances: Thurman and the late David Carradine are wonderful onscreen, and the supporting cast do a great job on their own. Still, I can't say that I enjoyed watching Kill Bill Vol 2. Like Vol 1, it's not a film that I would admire, even though many others do admire it. Again, if you love this film, then that's fine by me. But in my honest opinion, I don't really like this film, so I don't care for it very much.

I am totally sold on Blu and, when the Kill Bill bundle became available... well... I ordered it when Amazon offered it at a great discount. The bundle includes Kill Bill 1 and 2 and, IF you wish to upgrade your KBs I highly recommend the bundle because you could save a few dollars. There is no difference between the 2 KBs sold as individual titles and them sold together other than, possibly, the price.

I wish I had a lot to say about the Blu-ray version but I don't so, let me say what is worth saying:

- The contents of the Blu-ray version are EXACTLY those of the DVD edition, nothing more, nothing less.
- Even the artwork is borrowed from the original DVD edition.
- The 'extras' are shot in low resolution, in fact they are the exact extras you will find on the DVD.
- The resolution of the movie is, of course, higher than the DVD's and the audio is available as 'uncompressed' but nothing special was done for the Blu issue. I noticed quite a few artifacts and some graininess but, overall, the picture quality is good. It could have been a lot better. I expect a remastered edition in the near future.

Overall, I am not very happy with this edition which appears to have been put together on the cheap and in a hurry. I suspect that the digital master used to make the DVDs was quickly converted to Blu and thrown out on the market but I could be wrong.

I am looking forward to a complete and professionally done Tarantino filmography on Blu in the near future, meaning that I'd be buying the Kill Bills three times.

On deciding whether to buy this release or not it should be up to one's budget. Those who don't have the DVD edition but have a Blu player, definitely buy the Blu, preferably the bundle because one never knows when a superior version may be released.

1417354,3,B00005AQ65,"Despite what many have said about KB2 being better it's not. It's an ok film that narratively stands on its own, but shows the utter superfluity of KB1, which could have had its backstory sliced to a 6 or 7 minute prologue. KB2 opens with the Bride ready to take on Bill's own baby brother- the 3rd member of the Assassins, Budd (Michael Madsen). After stalking him to his trailer home he blows her away with a buckshot of salt. Why he does not kill her with regular bullets is a silly question since this is comic book logic. Additionally, he offers to turn over the Bride's body to Bill's last assassin for $1 million. She's another blonde killer femme, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who is missing an eye & wears a patch. Cue classic 1930s serial film villain stupidity: Budd buries the Bride alive. He even gives her a flashlight in her nailed coffin. Flashback: to her training under misogynistic Chinese Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This is needless digression because the stereotyped character- similar to KB1's involving the Bride's training with master swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba)- adds nothing to the tale that could not have been added in a few casual throwaway references in the script.
  Length is also a big problem. The 2 films run 226 minutes, or just a quarter hour shy of 4 hours. They were originally to be a single entity but, having had so few films from Tarantino over the years his company wanted to double the bang for the buck. Thus the  mishmash editing. Individual scenes are expertly paced and woven, but there are just reams of scenes that do not advance the essential shark-like plot. This is not just taste speaking- too many scenes with trivial but wannabe colorful characters grind the film to a snail's pace. Trim the 90 minutes of KB1 down to 20 or 30 minutes of action, trim the 136 minutes of the plodding KB2 in half & you would've had a very good 90-100 minute film with all the excellent action and revelatory scenes intact. The KB films are a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness). Another thing gained by making the films one would be that the teaser at the end of KB1, where we find out Beatrix has a daughter, could be cut and that revelation unfold to both character and audience when she actually confronts Bill. Not that the emotion would have overwhelmed, but knowing this fact about Beatrix before she does castrates whatever empathy we might feel for her near the film's climax.
  That Tarantino did not see these points, or did but gave in to them, seems to support my belief that he has yet to show the maturity of a great director. He seemed to be going in the right direction with Jackie Brown (easily his best & most mature film) but has regressed with the 2 Kill Bills. Of KB2 I'd grade it 65 of 100, & for the duo of films I'd give it a 75. I hope I'm wrong, but he seems destined, and satisfied, to be merely an A director of B films.",1222300800,,2975,4.532588454376164

*Blu-Ray has excellent picture quality.  I don't think there's any grainy parts at all; it's completely crisp and clear.
*Great sound quality.  Sounds clearer and more balanced than previous DVD release.
*Includes a 26-minute making-of featurette, a deleted scene, and a musical performance.  It's not a whole lot of features (in fact, the same as from the DVD), but at least it has something.
*Some good action and fighting.
*Some good visuals. Still a smooth and clear picture.
*Still a good story, with a very good conclusion. Also fills in lots of gaps from the first film.
*Still an excellent group of characters that you can relate to. It is especially interesting to see Bill for the first time, among other things.
*Dialogue is strong and interesting.
*More interesting music.
*Lots of homage to westerns, kung fu, and anime. These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.

The Bad Things
*It's not the ""Wholy Bloody Affair"" edition.
*It's longer and there's much less action.
*Still has some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film stylish and fun).

This is a definite must-see for anybody who has seen the first film. All of the missing story elements are present, and brings everything into clarity. The conclusion is excellent (even if there is no fighting). I don't think this is as stylish or exciting as the first film, but it is definately worthwhile to see the complete story.

Whether or not it is worthy of replacing the DVD is entirely up to you.  I liked the movie enough to go for it, and at the very least, I am pleased with the picture/sound quality.  I'll still want to grab the ""Whole Bloody Affair"" edition (you know, unrated director's cut with shedloads of special features and other crud) whenever it comes out, but considering that it never existed in the first place, I am not one to complain.  Heck, I might even keep this copy, so I have the theatrical cut.  Altogether, I don't agree with the others who complain.  It's still a good movie, and it's of good quality.",1221177600,,2080,4.734072022160665

1417376,5,B00005AQ65,"If you like gross, overly violent, graphic films, then you'll like Kill Bill Vol. 1 more, but this one was way better.  I watched the first, and barely could sit through it because it was so gross and sick.  However, I found volume 2 much better, with a better story line, and action packed.  It completed the story, and thus had more of a story line.  If you consider watching people get dismembered and children bleeding out their predators as action and entertainment, you may like 1 better.

I almost didn't watch 2 because of how much I found 1 distasteful, but I was told 2 was less violent, so I watched and I'm glad I did, as this is one of my favorite movies!

I know they are one movie, but if you watch them, you wouldn't think so.",1219104000,,742,4.264285714285714

Note: Before reading this review for Kill Bill Vol. 2, please read my review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Vol-1/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;to avoid confusion.

Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown and Kill Bill Vol. 1) delivers the second half of his epic revenge melodrama, Kill Bill, with his usual stylistic flare. As with Vol. 1, he gives tribute to the many genres* that have inspired him since his childhood. Unlike Kill Bill Vol. 1, Vol. 2 focuses more on human drama rather than gory action but it still packs a punch. The story is more typical of Tarantino's writing, relying heavily on witty banter between immoral characters who suffer the delusion that they are following some strict code of honor. Another difference between Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 is the tone of the film. Vol. 1 is very much an amalgamation of samurai, blaxploitation, and revenge melodrama. Vol. 2 is more of a spaghetti western/kung fu/dysfunctional family drama.

Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues The Bride's quest for revenge against her former boss/lover, Bill, who four years earlier massacred her husband-to-be and her friends during her wedding rehearsal. But Bill has a secret: the daughter that The Bride was pregnant with, whom she believed to have been killed, is alive and happily living with her father, Bill. And for the first we are shown how The Bride became the killer that she is. We see her cruel tutelage under kung fu master Pai Mei, who takes her past the breaking point and keeps pushing her to excel. We see the day that she realized she was pregnant and decided to leave killing behind her. And we see the day that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) killed her friends before putting her in a coma. With all of these events in mind, The Bride continues down the blood-soaked path to vengeance. #3 on her ""Death List"" is Bill's younger brother, Budd, who has no intention of becoming just another splatter mark leading to Bill. When The Bride shows up, Budd is waiting with a shotgun and a shovel. He shoots her in the chest and then buries her alive in the desert. Budd plans on selling The Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword to Elle Driver, #4 on The Bride's ""Death List"" and one of the top members of the Deadly Vipers, but Elle is lethally cunning and she despises Budd for killing The Bride before she had the chance to do it herself. Little does she know that The Bride has escaped from her premature burial site and is on her way to kill Budd (who is already dead thanks to Elle). When The Bride arrives, she and Elle duke it out in an intimately savage fight which ends in an unexpectedly abrupt manner. Without stopping for respite or recovery, The Bride Travels to Acuna Mexico where she looks up an old retired pimp, Esteban Vihaio, who served as a father figure to Bill. It is from Esteban that she finally learns the location of Bill himself. The Bride hits the road once again and it's not long before she reaches her destination where Bill is waiting with their daughter, B.B.. Bill and The Bride hide their vendetta from their daughter but after she's safely tucked into bed they confront one another. After a long discussion about the nature of heroes and dual identities, about leading a double life of mediocrity and intrigue, they fight briefly. In the end Bill is, of course, dead but so is The Bride. She lives on in a new incarnation, not as The Bride, a killer, but as Mommy. Mommy and B.B. drive off into the sunset and live happily ever after.

There have been some critics who have been disappointed with the film's climactic showdown between The Bride and Bill. Most of them complained that either Bill's death was too simple and dignified or that the final duel should have been more of a spectacle like the final battle in the first film. However, upon close examination the ending is entirely appropriate, both emotionally and pragmatically. All this time The Bride has been a stoic and impersonal killer and only when she was with Bill or when she was pregnant was she intimate and human. This duality was necessary in her violent line of work, but when she kills Bill she is released from this shifting imbalance and made whole. Only when he is dead can she become human again and act as a mother to her daughter. It is this removal of evil from the world that gives her the strength to survive and redeem herself. She's no longer The Bride, she's simply Mommy; a woman freed from the cruelties of men, a mother who does not attack but to defend her offspring. It's odd but the film which started off as a tribute to genre films and exploitation is in the end an ironic allegory for feminism and non-violence.
The cast (as always is the case in Tarantino's films) is wonderful especially Uma Thurman as The Bride/Mommy, Michael Madsen as Budd, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, David Carradine as Bill, and Gordon Liu as Pai Mei.

Special features include The Making of Kill Bill Vol. 2, a performance by Robert Rodriguez' band Chingon, and a deleted scene.

1417379,4,B00005AQ65,"And I just feel like laughing at it. KILL BILL. Short simple amusing little title for such a long drawn out oddly serious film. So long in fact that it had to be chopped in two, as we all know. Looking at separate pieces I see nothing to gripe about whatsoever. Most every scene seems perfect. Taken as a whole, I find an overly self-serious, bloated, pretentious film. IMHO, KILL BILL would have benefitted greatly as one film under 2 hours and done more as a comedy rather than a revenge drama.

I guess I wanted a revenge comedy. Or a revenge dramadey. And maybe a little bit more focus on just telling this story instead of on what the project was really about, which was a grand tribute to various genres the director grew on. I like trash, and I like art, but I like my trash best when there is no confusing it with anything other than what it is. I don't have as much love for the cr*p as Tarantino. But who really does? That guy is a mutant, a real life ""Cable Guy"" that spent his entire youth in a movie theater. So maybe that's why I lack a little bit of appreciation for this homage to cr*p. Don't mean to offend the faithful here. Tarantino is still the man, although I wish he'd quit talking so damn much and work more --I mean, have you ever seen someone as brilliant at self promotion? KILL BILL was six long years after what was that film? And what's he up to now? (I'll look online in a minute.) I still think it's great though, but not as fun (for lack of a better term) as I personally would have preferred. Your maybe thinking, what the hell are you talking about? I mean, I wanted to laugh my a-- off with this one. I wanted BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA sillyness. But that's just my 2 cents.
Some highlights from Volume 2:
Pai Mei is my favorite character. Michael Madsen gave an Oscar worthy performance as Bud, Bill's brother. Great performances all around. Great soundtrack as always. Visually just a gorgeous picture.
From Volume 1:
The anime and watching hundreds of Japanese chodes having their limbs removed.",1207180800,,2036,4.372031662269129

1417381,4,B00005AQ65,"I loved the movie KILL BILL VOLUME 1. I thought it was not only a great tribute to the films that director Quentin Tarantino loved seeing in those grind houses long ago, but a fantastic action film in its own right. And now the final chapter in the story (so far), the second film reaches screens around the world. And...it is different.

Suffice to say that if you walk into this film expecting the first, you will be terribly disappointed. The gore fest bloodshed has toned down, the massive amounts of swordplay, gone. Instead we find a more philosophical Tarantino film, a movie more about wordplay than swordplay. And while taken aback by it at first, I found that the more I thought about it the better it was.

Having finished off the first two targets on her list, The Bride (as Uma Thurman's character is known so far) sets out to finish the job she started. The film opens with her making this statement and then flashing back in this chapter to what brought it all about, the massacre that we witnessed in the first film and why it came to be.

We discover that she was the love of Bill's (David Carradine) life and that he was torn apart by her leaving him. So much so that he made the decision that if he couldn't have her no one could. He refused to let her leave the ranks of the assassination squad he had formed. At least we think this for now.

With each chapter we are given more information as we discover who it was that trained the Bride. It was Bill's former master, Wei Ping (Gordon Liu). He takes on the task of training the Bride, something that comes in handy later on when she finds herself buried alive by Bud (Michael Madsen) after she attacks him.

Bud, who we discover is Bill's brother, is down on his luck, working as a bouncer in a low class strip joint in El Paso. Having spoken with Bill already, he is waiting for Uma. Thinking he has done her in, he contacts Elle (Daryl Hannah) to sell of her sword. But Elle has different plans for Bud. And Uma has plans for her.

A face off between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the bride occurs in Bud's trailer. The swords fly and the movements are swift while confined to the small space of the trailer. But a winner emerges. By death? We are left to figure that out on our own.

And finally, Uma heads out for a contact that will put her in touch with Bill. The final confrontation, begun with the release of the first film, unfolds. Not only that, but the surprise that Bill has in store for Uma as well. And as the surprises are revealed, conversation between these two combatants unfold the entire story that we have only been given portions of to date.

Tarantino took much flack with the first film in that the dialogue that he is noted for was kept to a minimum while the action took the forefront. Critics blasted him for this. He has stated that the film wasn't complete with that one and keeping that in mind while watching makes the film a better experience for the viewer. When he finished, he realized that he could not release the entire picture without it being a 4 hour opus. Instead, he cut it in two and released the stories separately making them unite as a whole.  Keep this in mind while watching and it makes a difference.

The acting in this film is wonderful, especially from David Carradine. Though never quite a fan of his, he does a great job here as Bill, offering his philosophies on life and love and the results of the same. Michael Madsen is underused but does a great job with what little time he has onscreen. And Hannah makes one of the meanest villains on screen in some time.

But the role of the Bride (whose name is revealed finally....but don't expect me to give it here) as played by Thurman is what makes this film. It is not only the emotions that she must convey, but the physical aspects of it and delivery of dialogue in a way that makes it all believable. And Thurman does each one of these with an ease never seen before.

KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a good movie and an entertaining experience. See part one on DVD before watching this though and take it in as a whole film. Those who do will find more rewards than those who see it as two different films.",1205539200,2,4172,4.341463414634147

1417421,5,B00005AQ65,"All grown men have a little boy in their heart that still surfaces every now and again...some fellows more so than others, and it's always so much fun to go back.  That is one of the many reasons I enjoy having a son waiting to greet me when I come home from a day of work or a long business trip. On the flip side, Quentin Tarantino gets to go back to being a boy every time he goes to work, and I say good for him.

The Kill Bill movies are a potent effusion of likely all the things Quentin grew up with.  Westerns, Kung-Fu movies, Samurai movies and other action films that helped mold and create his robust imagination.  Now, he can take the ideas that inspired him as a child and make them even better for the next generation of action-craving bloodthirsty little children.  Kill Bill volume 2 is more than a derivitive tribute film, it is an elicitation of massive nostalgia, excentuated keenly by incredible dialogue.  Other than function well as a conclusion to the series, it is actually quite different from Kill Bill volume 1 in a few ways.  Kill Bill volume 1 contained mostly introductions, followed by bloody action as Beatrix Kiddo took on and took out Vernita Green, O-Ren Ishii, Go-Go Yubari and of course the Crazy 88 (yes, all 88 of them).  But in Kill Bill volume 2, I felt like those were merely the supporting villains as Kiddo takes on the more resourceful and profound antagonists in this film; Elle Driver, Budd and of course Bill himself.  The sequel, unintentionally perhaps as the two were written and filmed together, possesses more depth than the first part.  There is more room for dialogue and that is of course a great thing because outrageous and unlikely dialogue is one of Quentin's strengths, and it serves here to make the characters even more unearthly and super-hero-like then in the first film.

Overall, in volume 2 we get to see how Beatrix learned her skills and we learn more about the relationship between her and Bill.  It all leads up to an often criticized climax between Bill and Beatrix.  Between the dialogue and David Carradine's performance, the climax helped me enjoy this film a bit more than volume 1.  So, if you prefer action and violence you will like the first movie better, but if you just so happen to get caught up in the characters along the way and have an appreciation for the kind of concentrated cultural yearning crossed with mythical level characters that only a Tarantino film can deliver, then Kill Bill volume 2 is a great cap to the two films.  For me, simply put, together they make one amazing movie.",1180656000,7,2578,4.573913043478261
1417422,5,B00005AQ65,"You've seen vol 1 and thought do I really want to sit through another 2 hours of swords and kung-fu? Well vol 2 is the much better film, so the answer is yes.

Curiously enough although Vol 2 is longer, it seems to have a tighter construction. Some of the chapters are breath-taking, perhaps because they are shorter. The Pai-Mei chapter is simply marvellous. Uma Thurman gets her training with Pai Mei and Bill tells her ""remember no sarcasm, no back-talk at least not for the first year or so, gonna have to let him warm up to you""! The Pai Mei chapter ties a lot of things together as well.

Oh yes in vol 2 we get to see Bill for the first time. David Carradine is great, very cool, and occasionally seems to become Kwai Chang Caine again all these years later.

I'd recommend seeing Vol 1 first, although it isn't quite as essential to do this, as it is to watch vol 2 after watching vol 1.

1417433,5,B00005AQ65,"i tend to bounce back-and-forth in my mind as to which half of the ""kill bill"" story i like better. as of writing this review, i'm going to have to go with ""vol. 2"", perhaps just because it's the one i've seen more recently, but i'm thinking there's more to it than that, so i'll try to get to those points instead.

first off, this really is like splitting hairs, picking which volume is better. now, believe all of those who point out how incredibly different the movies are because they are absolute night and day, but equally good and, more importantly, equally enjoyable.

i guess the one and only edge that i'd have to give ""volume 2"" is that the character's you get to spend time watching in this half (alongside the Bride, who is just as awesome here as in ""vol. 1"") are just more in-tune with what i like to see. for example:

-i LOVE the character of Bill, and found the scenes between he and the Bride to be among my favorite ever ""ex-lover"" face-off's in all cinema. they're is certainly a nastiness to the scenes, but you can SEE the two of them still deeply caring for another, despite themselves, esp. upon the conclussion of their showdown. it is just excellent.

-Michael Madsen's Bud is quite possibly the most difficult character to not like in any movie ever. despite his actions toward the Bride (no more detail. don't want to ruin anything in case you haven't seen it.), you just can't help but kinda feel for the guy. i mean, a dude that has to take junk off his boss, clean up nasty toilet water at a [...]-hole strip bar, then go home to his El Paso trailer to sit alone and listen to Johnny Cash records just kinda screams ""feel bad for me"" even if we really don't wanna. Bud is awesome, and i like having more of him, so yet another nod to ""vol. 2"".

-Pei Mei is freakin' awesome, esp. if you love the old kung-fu movies that the ""kill bill"" series was so lovingly created to replicate. awesome!

-Elle Driver is my absolute favorite member of the divas, so her being more prominant in this half alone makes me love it, love it, love it! just EXACTLY what a ""bad guy"" bad girl should be, man. all this, and the revelations made during the throwdown between she and the Bride just makes that fight (and the conclussion of said fight) SO much cooler it's just insane!

there is one more character in this movie that i thought was a really neat addition, but to talk about this is to REALLY ruin the movie, so just in case, i'll let you guys decide who you think belongs in this fifth spot.

overall, ""kill bill"" start-to-finish is outstanding in everyway, but i wanted to yack about ""volume 2"" today, so that's that. thanks for reading and enjoy!",1176940800,2,2671,4.392712550607287

Volume 2, however, spends a lot of time on a plot that bothered me more and more when I thought about it.  In the end, I found it overly simplistic and irritating (trying not to give anything away here).  I kept waiting for a twist that never came.  While the first volume was mostly fluff, a lot of style with no substance, it was enjoyable as that at least.  The second volume has more plot, but this does not end up as more substance.  But in the second volume, the time that is spent on the plot takes away from the style and we end up with two and a half hours which are not very enjoyable.",1175472000,2,715,4.107913669064748
1417435,4,B00005AQ65,"How do you follow a bloody, though often slow at times, sword-fighting extravaganza? Any attempt to either recreate the magic of the first movie or go off in an entirely different direction would be very risky. It is even more risky to place the fate of your movie in the hands of David Carradine. To say that, for the most part, swords will stay sheathed and instead acting will rule the day in Volume 2 was an interesting move and had you told me ahead of time that it would be so, I would not have believed you. After the fact, I can say that David Carradine is a star.

After much deliberation, I feel that I liked Volume 2 better than Volume 1. There were no characters that I enjoyed in Volume 1, while I loved the introduction of both Pai Mei (the martial arts master) and Esteban Vihaio (Bill's Spanish-speaking father figure). The highlight, however, was Bill.

He is a charismatic man to whom it would seem everyone takes a liking. His scratchy voice, which borders on a whisper, somehow soothes and calms. No one should wonder how he, with his charm; inteligence; and martial arts ability, rose to his position of power. And yet based upon what we know about Bill's relationship with The Bride, it is no surprise that the series is titled ""Kill Bill.""

I never expected to be so impressed with the writing in a Quentin Tarantino film. The story, though cheesy, was well planned out and the dialogue was perfect for the feel and direction of the film. The plot of the first movie was like a bunch of boulders placed next to each other, and Volume 2 was the sand poured over them to fill in the gaps. Most of Volume 2 was the back story which was lacking from Volume 1, but not so noticeably absent that it was not entertaining. There were questions that went unanswered until the second installment, which is expected in a series.

Kill Bill Volume 2 added depth to the plot and the characters introduced in Volume 1. It featured martial-arts fighting scenes, but introduced more verbal sparring than its prequel. Uma Thurman is the headlining star of the Kill Bill series, but David Carradine stole the show when he breathed life into Bill while The Bride tried to take it away.",1175212800,,2189,4.52020202020202

1417437,5,B00005AQ65,"I sometimes joke that, to me, Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the second-greatest movie of all time and that Kill Bill, Volume 2 is the greatest movie ever. On a serious note, both volumes are excellent releases and do not disappoint, especially for Tarantino fans who were hoping for intense elements of Pulp Fiction.

Kill Bill, Volume 2 picks up with Black Mamba's rampage for redemption and revenge for the murder of her fiance and those closest to him. From start to finish is action in sync with brilliant dialogue that is mixed in with occasional flashes of humor.

Beatrix Kiddo, aka Black Mamba, as played by Uma Thurman, is a woman on a mission, a kind of mission where no one in this sequel can truly assist her. Besides her weapons, there is no support or assistance that she will be receiving in order to possess the physical and psychological edges that will be needed in order to overcome what were her nemeses.

Some very scary situations and predicaments are myriad throughout, but much inspiration can be drawn from witnessing the outcomes resulting from Beatrix Kiddo's firm resolve to not be overcome by fear and panic in the worst of situations, perilous or not.

Great music accompanies the fighting sequences that Kiddo must endure and the haphazardous journey travels that have to be undertaken. Charlie Feathers' Can't Hardly Stand It and three Ennio Morricone classics from movies past, namely Il Tramonto, L'Arena, and A Silhouette of Doom are aptly mixed in, along with other great musical arrangements and reproductions that unanimously make both Kill Bill Volumes not only among the greatest in motion pictures but also in movie soundtracks.

""If you're a fan of volume 1 then you should be more then satisfied.""

Apparently, most people here agree with him... but, I don't.

Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different than Kill Bill Vol. 1.

Vol 2, continuing the Bride's quest for revenge, is a much tamer, subdued and introspective film than the gaudy comic richness of Vol 1. The fight sequences are smaller and more ""realistic"" (though they still aren't realistic by any means) than in the first film; this movie is more about fleshing out the characters and their motivations and emotions. The Bride even gets a name.

And, as they say, ""your mileage may vary."" Me? I preferred the styles in Volume 1. I liked the cheesy, over-the-top 70s homage, the siren-like announcements of fights (used once here, then discarded) and the anime sequence. There is one sequence in Vol 2. which I find very clever--the training with Kung Fu legend Pei Mei, which is straight out parody--but overall, Vol 2. is simply slower and longer than Vol 1.

But, like I say: other people will really like this movie, and many will even prefer it to Vol 1. It all depends on your taste, going in.

Despite my prefering the first part, I take comfort in the thought that these two movies kind of represent an artist's palette. Over the course of the two films, Tarantino has experimented and experimented in film genre and style, and I can only guess that these experiences will help him to develop his voice and grow in the future. In short, the kid's still learning, and I think that means that he's only going to get better, which is pretty incredible when you consider that he's already one of the best directors we have.

It is very different than Vol. 1, and I personally wasn't completely satisfied, but still an intriguing film. Three stars.",1158019200,4,1825,4.645962732919255
1417467,5,B00005AQ65,"In this day and age when sequels like `Matrix Reloaded' and such pollute our cinemas and ruin the glory of their predecessors I am pleased to have found a sequel worthy of its name.  `Kill Bill Vol. 2' is really less a sequel and more a continuation, but call it what you may, it still works.

Picking up where `Vol. 1' left off we have The Bride (Thurman) exacting her revenge against the men and women that killed her friends and family, but there's a twist.  The unborn child she thought was murdered was in fact preserved.  The question remains that will her child with Bill change her plans to kill him?

Filled with brilliant acting on all counts, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine reprising their roles as Elle and Bill, each of them doing brilliantly to bring the right amount of emotion and character to their roles, this movie is raised from action blockbuster status to Oscar caliber.  My favorite performance though is from Michael Madsen who plays Budd; a man who knows what they've done is wrong but isn't prepared to die for it.

This film is somewhat slower than the first and focuses more on The Bride's emotional battles than her physical ones.  That doesn't by any means take away from the enjoyment received from watching this masterpiece.  A perfect companion to the first film, Tarantino and Thurman deliver a great film that will be remembered as classic for a long time to come.",1156291200,4,1401,4.6396761133603235

1417469,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill vol. 2 was a magical movie which transports its viewer to another world of cold blood revenge mixed with lots of heart. The truth is Kill Bill vol. 2 is not as much of an eastern influenced movie as the first. Where vol. 1 was a revenge tale that consisted entirely of fake blood, back flips, and samurai swords, vol. 2 focuses on the heart and souls of the characters. Uma Thurman is back as the bride, and while she is still out on her path of revenge for the killing of her fianc, the story takes a detour right in the middle that shows her origins. The Pei Mei sequence is humorous, and sets the stage for future events. At one point, Thurman is berried alive by one of the people that were on her death list. The scene is mildly frightening but in all reality nothing is actually shown. The entire scene shows nothing but the pitch black darkness of her underground tomb. If the audience is not fully engrossed in what they are watching, they might be a tab bit bored during this duration of the movie which lasts about 13 minutes. Like vol. 1, this film is broken in to chapters, starting with chapter 6. Although this movie is director by the infamous Quentin Tarantino, the film is not nearly as violent as was the first. One of the only violent parts is when Elle Driver, (Daryl Hannah), and the bride fight the brutal battle of the blondes. The scene ends with an eye pulled out of its socket. This is not a pretty sight as you can imagine. Hard core fans might not approve of the lack of action and overload of story, but since the story has such a level of coherence, it works. This film is a superb look in to a killers mind and the emotions they go through, and although the sword may have dulled the second time a around, audiences should stick around to see Uma Kill Bill.",1151884800,2,1798,4.291176470588235
1417470,5,B00005AQ65,"If you managed to sit through the ok-ish part one, then your reward starts right here.

This is just like Volume 1, but amped up about ten times over. For starters, the storyline is more convincing, detailed and interesting. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has more to do than just kill lots and lots of people.

And because of that, there is also more, and better, character development. The characters were one of the better elements of part 1, and of course, all the survivors are back for this volume, but with more depth.

Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and Uma are all fantastic as their respective characters, truly making you believe in their twisted, violent world.

David Carridine is brilliant as the titular Bill. His performance makes you sympathetic to Bill, despite you knowing that he is the baddie, and an exceptionally cruel person. But we still love him! A fantastic character played to perfection.

There's also less action than part 1 and all the more better for it. Part 1's overblown, cartoony action is replaced with shorter, but more gritty, realistic and violent set pieces. Check out the trailer fight between Uma nd Darryl Hannah. Superb.

A shout should also go out for Robert Rodriguez's music. Allegedly, he composed the film for only $1, and if so, Tarantino certainly got his moneys worth!

Tarantino's direction also shines more clearly here, with the scene where The Bride is buried alive particularly springing to mind. Horrifying, chilling, yet stylishly done.

In fact, the one thing that really drags this film down a bit is the tutorial scenes with Pei Mei. Slightly dull, a bit too long, it takes you away from the real crux of the story at a crucial point.

Nevertheless, a fine film that deserves to be watched, even if you do have to sit through part 1 first. You will be glad you did.",1151193600,3,1820,4.752380952380952

Kill Bill Volume 2 delivers yet another heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords and quirky dialogue. The movie begins where Volume 1 left off: The Bride, now revealed as Beatrix Kiddo, played by Thurman, has just killed two of her former co-members in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Vernita Green, played by Vivica A. Fox, and O-Ren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu. Now, Beatrix is determined to get to the leader of them all and once she does she will kill Bill, played by Caradine, but not before she confronts the one-eyed maniac Elle Driver, played by Hannah, in the most memorable fight scene of all Kill Bill films, and Bud, played by Madsen, Bill's trailer dwelling brother. Along the way, we are finally introduced to Bill (in the first Volume, Bill is heard but not seen). We're also given Bill's motives for ordering the assault on the Texas church where The Bride, her fiance and companions were brutally massacred by the DiVAS. The sequel also explores how Kiddo, or The Bride, was trained into becoming a killing machine, and, finally, introduces us to the fate of The Bride's baby and who the father is.

Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 have been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. As one whole movie, Kill Bill is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films of the first decade of the millennium.

I believe the second film has surpassed the first in every way.  The acting is better (since the characters are actually familiar and relatable), the fight scenes are funnnier and more entertaining, and the finale is quite impressive.

I admit though, it didn't have any blood-spurting action scenes like the previous film did, but for what action there was, it was fantastic. This is for sure the best recent movie dealing with the martial arts. I absolutely loved it and it rekindled my fanaticism with David Carridine who I have been a fan of since I watched him on Kung Fu: The Legend Contiues in the 90's as well as the original series on repeats. Everyone chosen in this film fit their character perfectly. A lot of surprises that are untold are unveiled in this movie and you find yourself going, ""oh cool"", over and over again. Like I said, it didn't have all the action that the first movie had, but what it did have was an excellent story line. Very, very well written. I loved Pai, the one who trained ""The Bride"". Every character is very realistic and I just can't get passed how awesome this and it's prequel is. Tarantino really has set a new standard for martial arts movies that very few will every come close to accomplishing if they ever do.

1417493,1,B00005AQ65,"The whole Kill Bill film is one of the dullest, most pointless exercises in celluloid that I have ever witnessed.  While volume one was decent, volume two scenes drag on and on. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Volume two plays like an outtake/deleted scene featurette on a DVD.  Most of the scenes are useless, and they go way too long.  Critics gushed all over this, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films. And the influence (and the blatant ripping off) of them permeates his work.  If you need to watch a 4 hour film, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, or Once Upon a Time in America are available.

There are some seriously disturbing scenes in this movie involving children and frankly the idea is that all is justified by revenge and by the fact that the protagonist gets her child back.  I cannot help but wonder if this is some kind of post 9/11 self justification movie.  These seem to be getting more common; witness Battlestar Galactica and all of its melodrams, or even War of the Worlds.  Our ethical values of much of the last century are being challenged and not for the better either.  The real crime here however, is that the movie is hackneyed.  The idea that all of the violence and death is justified by revenge and getting the little girl is so old it is pathetic.

Yeah Beatrix finally gets Bill, but the movie has a bigger focus than that. We actually get to see a lot of things that were left open after vol 1. First, and in my opinion, most importantly, we see exactly how Beatrix got the skill to kill all of those against her. Her teacher gave her some seriously brutal training. Obviously it was well worth it. Second, we find out why she left Bill in the first place. And why Bill decided that she needs to die. And we finally see how Elle lost her freakin eye(sweet!). Okay, there wasn't half as much blood and violence in this one as vol 1, but the fight with Beatrix and Elle was off the chain.

The fight scene with the Crazy 88s goes down in my memory as one of the greatest I've ever seen, and that last battle with Oren was sad and beautiful and incredibly fierce.  I wanted to love Kill Bill 2 but frankly, it just doesn't measure up. It's like Tarantino gave the best of what he had to the first movie and threw in some cold leftovers for the second.

There is only one good fight scene in Bill 2. When Elle and the Bride get together in Bud's foul little trailer it's a doozy but the audience has to wait a long, long time for it. Here's one small nitpick. Why did Elle introduce Bud to the Black Mamba? I would've preferred to see the Bride get her rematch with him.

Part of the problem with this moive is that the China scenes should've been shorter and part of it is that Bill is shown too early. It would've been much better we didn't get to see the snake charmer fully until the last chapter. And speaking of the last chapter I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wasn't happy with the incedibly wimpy way things went down with Bill.

The Bride goes through hell and dishes it out to all the DIVAS and has like five seconds of fight with the Man himself. What a let down! I suspect Tarantino knew he couldn't pull off another Oren/Bride type of triumph so he did a quickie meeting with Bill but that stinks. The audience has sat and waited for this meeting and it doesn't meet expectations.

If you don't, then you'll probably be bored and annoyed.  He's an artist pushing the limits of his craft and basically making himself happy - and what's wrong with that?  Isn't that what so many artists would love - a chance to produce something totally their own?

KBV2 really hits its mark when we *finally* arrive at Bill's ""lair"" and meet Bebe. (Bebe?)  He slows the pace down and lets you sit back and savor the subtly brilliant naturalistic acting of Carradine. A mesmorizing force, Carradine rules every scene that he's in; it's almost like he's got you under some crazy thespian spell.

All in all, a fabulous film for those of you who love acting, dialogue, action, pushing of limits, and that self-indulgent factor named Quentin Tarantino.",1133654400,,902,4.849673202614379

The first movie was more artistic and so good at building up tension, and the second resolves everything, answers all the questions, reveals motivations and character. But maybe tying up loose ends is the way it's done in all the movies that Tarantino is parodying. Bill's reputation definitely preceeded and inflated him; he was even a bit boring - unusual for a Tarantino character.

As a film ignoramus, I was not equipped to figure out just what films Tarantino is flashing to, but I could tell that he was doing just that consistently throughout this movie(I think I caught one particular Shaw Bros reference, but I can't remember the name of the flick for the life of me). Anyway, be prepared for a considerably lower body count than Vol. 1-The Bride basically finishes off her list after being shot with rock salt, buried alive, and drugged. Watching her put down the miscast Daryl Hannah(she can't do mean) is definitely eye candy. That was a very bad pun, by the way, as you will find out should you see this.

Nothing of any real significance appears to be going on, and whether or not these moments get better in any repeat viewing, they can come off as extremely pointless.

1417525,2,B00005AQ65,"With the huge box office success and critical acclaim for ""Kill Bill Volume 1"", you can assume that expectations were extremely high for the final act in Quentin Tarentino's twisted tale of vengeance and mayhem, ""Kill Bill Volume 2"".  The big question surrounding the movie was, `Can the second film possibly live up to the first one, in terms of story and entertainment value, and as an overall movie?'  The answer is actually quite mixed.  But before I give you the reasons for why the response to the movie was so mixed, I will give you the basic plot synopsis for ""Kill Bill Volume 2"".

Picking up directly where ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" left off, `The Bride' is continuing her bloody quest for vengeance on her former mentor and lover, Bill, and his team of twisted killers.  With ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", the training for `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), is explored to show the audience how she is capable of killing with such ruthless efficiency.  After dispatching her brand of justice to the majority of Bill's assassins, `The Bride' doesn't have very much farther to go before reaching her ultimate goal of killing Bill.  But, the road to Bill is plagued with misfortune, and `The Bride' is going to need to use all of her training to survive.

Now that the plot synopsis is out of the way, I can get back to why response to ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" was less than stellar, when compared to the response to ""Kill Bill Volume 1"".  With ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" director and writer Quentin Tarentino delivered audiences a twisted tale of revenge, that was filled with plenty of violence, and not much in the way of exposition.  Whereas, in ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", the violence is toned down, almost to the point of non-existence in some cases, to make room for the exposition.  The problem here is that audiences were expecting the rest of `The Bride' killing off all of her former crew and her mentor, with maybe some exposition to fill in some more of the how's and why's of the whole thing.  Instead, what audiences got was basically the origin of `The Bride', how she learned to fight, her relationship with Bill, and how the whole thing went south on them.  Basically, Quentin let down his audience by setting the bar too high for himself with ""Kill Bill Volume 1"".  In my opinion, Quentin would have been better off to drop in some of the exposition from ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" into `Volume 1' and spread the action out better over the two films.  Had he done these two things, audiences probably would have responded better to ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", and both movies would have been equally entertaining.

Although, personally I thought that neither film was all that great, but that's just me and I'm not that big of a Tarentino fan.  But overall, the two films are at least worth watching once.

""Kill Bill Volume 2"" is rated R for violence and language.",1129248000,,2844,4.586956521739131
1417546,4,B00005AQ65,"Unlike its predecessor, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man`s thriller in its climactic scene.  This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiance and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding.  Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him.  But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.

The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today.  Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic.  Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.

Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role.  She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth.  It is here where the ""Kill Bill"" saga finally becomes a work of art.  As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first.  But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" from ten years earlier.",1128988800,2,2339,4.911167512690355
1417547,5,B00005AQ65,"The first Kill Bill was a pure delight. At the end, one wondered where the series would go next. I was surprised to find that the second volume was different in many ways from the first. The over the top and modernly stylized fights from the first film were replaced by old fashioned, chinese oriented action. There is also a much more western feel to the film. Overall, it just had a completely different feel, yet, it didn't betray it's first half. The characters were still faithful to themselves from the first go around, and the dialogue didn't seem to change much in tone.

This volume picks up right where the first one ends. The Bride is off to finish off the last of those who betrayed her, with it all ending with Bill. The story doesn't sway in the least, and in fact, it seems to be a bit simpler this time around. There are a few more twists in this one, but nothing too shocking. And of course, we finally learn the Brides true name, as well as we finally get to see the face of Bill.

It is debatable which of the two is actually the better film, but that depends on what it is you like more. This film replaces the modern, city-like environments with more western like environments: open desert, vista backgrounds, and mexican countryside. It certainly does give the movie a different feel, but this works for the better. The series is diversified to a greater extent by showing the multifaceted personalities of the many characters. We get a good feel for who Bud is, and to a greater extent, Bill. Like the first movie, the characters are well told, not just through their dialogue, but through their actions and surroundings.

The strong point, aside from character, is once again the writing. One of the best chunks of lines from any Tarantino film is in this movie, and it's about Superman nonetheless (you'll know what I mean when you see it). Elle, who was a so-so character in the first film, is much more fleshed out in this one. She takes on a much more despised role here (which is a good thing), and therefore, become a character we're much more willing to see. Pai Mei is also one of the best characters to come around in years, with his old-chinese-man look and foul mouth. Overall, the characters of this film are just generally more interesting, except for Go-go, who still holds a special place in this fans heart.

One thing that is debatable is whether or not the tone of the film, which changed dramatically, is a good thing or a bad thing. Some would say that the tone of this film is much better, but I for one think that it moved a little too slow. The first film moved with lightning pace, never taking a moment to stop and rest. This film however, takes its time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just a little less enthusiastic than the first one.

Just as in the first volume, V2 does an excellent job of finishing the series up. It doesn't betray it's characters or feel, while still being different enough to be a film on it's own right. It's just as stylish, just as well written, and simply put, a film that is just as good, maybe even better, than the first.",1127865600,,3115,4.448336252189142
1417548,1,B00005AQ65,"I have read literally dozens of reviews below where people laud Kill Bill 2 and praise Tarantino for the work he has done in 'elevating genres', 'recreating lost arts' and many other phrases that people have written to feel part of the Tarantino club. Yet I write this to defy all of that. Just because people TELL you a movie is good, doesn't mean it actually is.

Kill Bill volume 2 is one of history's worst movies. There, I've said it. At the very least, certainly one of the worst movies to receive hype on a large scale. Tarantino has created the Kill Bill movies as a way to showcase and pay homage to old genres that he so greatly revered, but in the process he managed to convince many people that this is actually a good movie as well. It's not. The story is dull and plodding, with two-and-a-half hours of nothing to sit through.

The characters sit at both ends of the talent spectrum. Characters such as The Bride, Elle Driver and Pai Mei are wonderfully crafted and should be enjoyed as such, but unfortunately Bill and Bud are just wastes of time. Boring performances are delivered from seemingly boring and under-talented actors. I understand the very Tarantino-esque idea of using a guy like David Carradine to portray Bill, but he should have got someone who can act instead.

As usual the music and cinematography are amazing, but Tarantino's tendency to change cinematography styles purely because he feels like it - rather than because it would be better for the scene - makes too many scenes worse than they should have been. However, one thing I will never fault Tarantino on is his selection of music. Both Kill Bill soundtracks are fantastic, with (I believe) Kill Bill 1's being slightly better. But that's mostly for Santa Esmerelda's mesmerising 'Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' playing during the memorable fight scene with Lucy Liu in the snow.

But of course, the main point and main detraction is that the story itself is an utter yawn-fest. If you can sit through 150 minutes of a 20 minute storyline and claim to enjoy it, then you probably deserve to watch it again. I personally found Kill Bill volume 1 too gory until the Bride came to Japan, where it became a spectacularly entertaining movie, but I can understand if others thought differently. Kill Bill 2 is not like that. The action is limited at best, the story plods along at a snail's pace and the cinematography and any plot twists are ruined by Tarantino's slavish homage to masters of genres that died long ago for good reason.

If you are a student of film, or someone who actively works in the industry than I apologise for your sake. I can completely understand why you would like this movie and be intrigued by it. It is a fascinating blend of genres and an intricate look at how Tarantino's mind works, creating a fusion of concepts and ideas. However, this does not detract from the fact that this is a very bad movie for the average viewer. Slow story, self-indulgent cinematography and some very poor acting in parts.

I don't pretend to be someone in the industry but I am someone who loves movies of all genres and embraces new ideas and visions. You will get no argument from me that Tarantino is a brilliant man. But this simply is not a good movie.",1126742400,14,3265,4.611015490533563
1417549,3,B00005AQ65,"This is the most dangerous review I've ever written--to me at least--and I'll keep it sort of brief; you don't walk through a cultural minefield without sweating a lot. I'm a big fan of all those splendid B and C movies that Herr Tarantino also loves. Just last month Bava's incredible ""Danger, Diabolik"" was released on DVD and I set off fireworks to celebrate the event. His ""Planet of the Vampires"" is probably one of my favorite films. Yet, I'm not a cult film/B-movie ""head."" My true loves are the films from the silent era on that combine the best of everything. B-movies became a draw when I realized some time ago that highly talented directors often got stuck in places where they had minimal budgets. It's also interesting to see how small resources sometimes dictate stylized or ritualized plots. Then there's craftily working with and around mediocre acting talent.

This movie is interesting, but it's not nearly as interesting as many of the films that Tarentino allegedly pays tribute to. As hard as he tries, he never seems to reach the levels of sweaty tension of great spaghetti western, he lacks Bava's art directorial and camera genius (in fact he really needs to study and understand cinematography better), his action is lukewarm and oddly linear compared to nearly any classic martial arts product, he consistently fails to get top notch performances out of his people and those performances vary directly with the various talents of his actors (Carradine is decent here and so is Daryl Hannah--a very under-appreciated actress--but Thurman lacks range and depth and always has). Throughout this strange and disjointed film Tarantino seems to show that he saw the limits of a lot of his favorite films but barely grasped how those limits were often transcended. Tarantino never seemed to grasp how others made lemonade out of lemons.

Add to this Tarantino's strange inability to make each and every shot potent and meaningful (again, he needs to study Bava and Leonne better) and ultimately his awkwardness in making the whole (and the storytelling) greater than the sum of its parts. He seems to think primarily in terms of a series of cool things he'd like to see on the screen, which, regrettably, is not first-rate film-making. I'm sorry that many people, including the director, aren't noticing this and I blame lack of familiarity or true understanding of his source material, perhaps even a certain amount of patronizing attitude toward the products of other cultures.

What this movie comes across as is kind of ""kids at play""--in Tarantino's specific case ""playing"" at being a film director, which, given his background, may be more than he cares to admit about himself. I'm not really trying to trash this guy and his work, I'm just upset that he's ransacked the genius of many Asian and European talents, made something up that's considerably less than what he's stolen, and allowed it to be presented to the world as some sort of tribute or summation of all this earlier work of other people when in fact it's kind of a self-indulgent ""toy"" movie.

Tarantino embodies a problem that's affected most of American culture in the last decades. Bluntly, we've become shallow and superficial, we've lost our ability to discern the inner workings of things, to grasp the sublime, to understand nuance, to notice and appreciate genuine genius, and to manage anything beyond our ""specialty"". ""Craft"" is beyond us since we now do everything on PCs and have lost the distinction between working with reality and working with pixels.

Few are outside of this problem and it shows up everywhere: from the inept response to Hurricane Katrina, to the spate of bad movies coming from Hollywood, to the idiocies of the political Right and Left, to our inability to make anything sensible happen in Iraq. Makeup is perfect, everyone reads their lines well, all those lines are spell-checked, every shot is perfectly lit, every set is flawless, every logo and buzzword ""pops,"" but beneath the shiny surface there isn't much of anything of any value any more--the best we can say is it has no merits but lacks obvious flaws. What the United States of America excells at right now is marketing images to people with no depth. We are the world's con-man. It's frightening to look at earlier products of American culture and encounter far greater talent and far better thinking.

""A Fistful of Dollars"" is an old movie that is better than ""Kill Bill"" on many major counts. ""Crouching Tiger"" is a contemporary film with better action, far better acting, much better cinematography, and a better script. Think of films like that and then think of the opening of this film where a dramatically (or even ironically) out-of-her-depth Uma woodenly delivers ""her story"" in a clumsily-written monologue. I've seen undergrads doing projects direct better and act better.

If I'm not ""getting it"" then what precisely am I not getting? As a tribute, this film is insulting; as parody, it's not funny and barely ironic, as straight film it's amateurish. I'd like to give it two stars but I'm not interested in taking an even worse ""Not Helpful"" beating from Tarantino fans who realize that all this criticism reflects on them a bit. Maybe a few will check out what I'm saying here, look harder and respectfully at source materials, and realize their idol has been feeding them Pablum. With a great director and a better cast imagine what these films could have been.",1126137600,4,5467,4.922993492407809

1417551,5,B00005AQ65,"More subdued, less bloody and with a personal approach to the storytelling, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is an outstanding and highly respectable companion to the first installment, ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" that for me is a true and original classic. But with that said, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" is a classic in its own right. It's a continuing story shown and told from a different viewpoint. In addition, the movie is effectively played out with imagination, visionary genius and amazing performances.

""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) hunts down the last three on her to-do-list, Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill (David Carradine), the man whose face and voice is a permanent reminder of her past, present and potential future.

""In Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" we're introduced to Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) a master of the martial arts, a man of wisdom, power and the only one who knows the secret of successfully carrying out the ""5 point palm exploding heart technique"" and the one who trained Beatrix Kiddo before she became ""The Bride.""

Although Budd, Elle and Bill want ""The Bride"" dead, they all have a deep-rooted respect, and for Bill, it's about the love he lost. If ""The Bride"" is going out, she's going out in fashion. For ""The Bride"" is the world's best assassin and her title should be a reflection of how her death is going to be played out, by whomever lays claim to her demise.

Did ""The Bride"" kill Bill and what ending manifested itself through all the horrid and hellish violence and deceit? You'll find out in Quentin Tarantino's illustrious homage to martial arts and the continuing quest of one woman's mission to seek revenge on those who did her so very, very wrong. ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" will leave you with the insight of how it began and why it ended the way it did. Although, with that said, my only gripe would have to be with the ending. With such a monster house of originality and creativity, it just looked too weak for me to become inspired by it.

Still eluding psychotic charm, and a heating-em-up, sizzle brain of freakiness was Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver. She's so hypnotic to watch, I just can't seem to find myself resisting her evil tendencies and oddness. Like the original, there were many poignant, articulately choreographed scenes and memorable characters. Gordon Liu is another, with his character of Pai Mei just reeking in flamboyant campy humor and stylish personality.

DVD extras include deleted scene, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" featuring Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" premiere Chingon performance (which was fantastic!), Widescreen (2.35:1) -enhanced for 16x9 televisions, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, DTS 5.1 digital surround sound, French language track, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Spanish subtitles.

1417552,1,B00005AQ65,"I'm not terribly surprised that the Kill Bill's were a disaster. The classic example was Dennis Hopper's elevation to zietgeist guru after 'Easy Rider' only to rapidly fall after being shipped off to Peru with a budget to play it again, Sam. The self indulgent results were the stuff of legend. Lumbered with a fiasco to rival Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guy's Don't Dance', the studio rightly calculated Kill Bill Vol 2 would have a sufficient fan base to be worth releasing and the die hards would pronounce it a masterpiece anyway. It has made money. Those of you who went to 'Reservoir Dogs' expecting to see 'an amazing, pumping powerhouse of a movie' (as the billing boasted) only to be confronted with a filmed stage play of tedious verbosity, will not be dismayed by the last quarter of Vol 2, which makes boredom almost an art form. I suspect the director is aware of this and took the CSI job to prove to the industry that he could do disciplined work with someone else's script.",1123632000,2,984,4.628571428571429
1417553,4,B00005AQ65,"There's 2 distinct themes when it comes down to comparing Vol 1 and Vol 2: Volume 1 was more influenced by japanese action and grindhouse cinema, whereas Volume 2 is more spaghetti western based. Volume 1 also didn't have any shred of character development: the Bride ripped and sliced her way through everyone without even offering some kind of connection for the audience. All of that has been dumped here, more dialogue heavy with a few action thrown in. Oh what a film these could've been.

Having sliced through 2 assassins in the first one, she's now onto the next 2: Budd, the brother of the titular character and the Bride's main target and Elle Driver, which is the more jealous underachieving side to the Bride. On her way to get Budd, something goes awry and she gets buried alive with us with her. And a bunch of stuff happens until finally we get to her ""confrontation"" with Bill.

Her confrontation isn't even a fight per se. It's like an exercise routine in the span of 8 seconds. Instead they talk and talk and reminisce about the troubled old days. There's many parts in the film that could've clearly been cut such as the suspense killing monologue Uma delivers at the very start of the film since she's telling us she just killed all the assassins and has one left. The recent Foo Fighters double cd reminds me of Kill Bill's both halves: chop them and make them one thing and you'd have an awesome movie. Instead we have 2 movies with great parts but not satisfying wholes.

David Carradine plays probably one of the better comebacks in film so far as Bill, a want to hate him but can't character who shows wisdom and a calm demeanor despite being, as he puts it, a ""murdering b*stard"". One scene has him threatening to shoot someone in the kneecap(arguably the 2nd most painful place to get shot in, after the stomach), fires a round into some fruit and laughs dismissing it in a kind of ""I'm just having fun"" attitude.

The others are good although I'm kind of polarized on Uma: she has the physicality of the role but there's something...off? Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 or Will Smith in Ali looked physically fit while still maintaining their performances, here she looks almost awkward. Of course the fan favorite was Gordon Liu(Johnny Mo in the kato mask in Volume 1) as Pei Mei, the cruel but incredibly skillful master who likes to stroke his beard a bit too often.

As with Volume 1, there's a degree of using the genres in a kind of copying way, as if they're paying homage to that style with the only intention of paying homage. Witness the fast zooms when Bride gets her training or the exaggerated whooshing sound when all she does is shake her head.

Everything works fine until she disposes of the last assassin. Then she gets whereabouts of Bill from a mexican, in another duel role with Michael Parks, who played the sheriff in Volume 1. After that the film starts to decompress, she reaches Bill and it just sputters.

Guess we'll have to wait for the Ultra Mega Rare(I love coming up with these)Edition with the film edited into one long(I'm talking at least 4 hours) or one awesome 2 and a half film. But so far, there's a good film here hiding.",1123286400,3,3188,4.553228621291448

This movie is just as gory(in an unnecessary amount) as the recent release Land of the Dead, the only difference is there are swords (in 2003 and 2004) and there is some kind of strange exagerated martial arts...  Overall it's simple to say Quentin Tarantino himself is overrated as a director as well (I didn't say actor because I don't think anyone has ever confused him as a good one in that catagory), and his truly only good movie was Pulp Fiction.  This movie as well as the first one were disapointing especially after all the hype i heard about both of them.

Uma Thurman.  She's supposed to be a cold-blooded Kung Fu assassin, but she just doesn't pull off the fight scenes very well.  On several occasions in both films, she seems weak, gangly and uncoordinated.  I wish he'd chosen another person for the lead role, but Tarantino considers her ""his"" actress, so there you are.

Kill Bill is sort of like Fight Club in that you either get it or you don't.  I get it, but I also see the flaws.  All in all, worth watching for Tarantino fans, but for others, no big deal if you give it a miss.",1121817600,2,688,4.120300751879699

The fact that each and every sequence is filmed with the dexterity and wisdom of a great film maker only elevates the film to a higher status. To accompany each scene --in turn making them that much more memorable and unique-- are brilliant, detailed character creations/thriving performances from each lead actor. At the top of this list are Uma Thurman and David Carradine, both of which deserve Oscar nominations for their work here. In the end, Kill Bill, Volume 2 is so original within its homage, so memorable despite the connecting tissues that tend to drag, so well-acted and deepened by great actors, that to resist its culminating emotional impact becomes an impossibility. See this. You will not be sorry, but be sure to keep in mind that Volume 2 is but the second half of one whole. Together, volumes 1 and 2 make a masterpiece, fully balanced and like nothing you've ever witnessed before; it is a package of cultural and cinematic references woven together into something that will itself be referenced as its own in the future, thanks to Tarantino's amazing skill and knowledge of what makes the movies a passionate art.",1120867200,2,1620,4.937728937728938

The action scenes are poor, the plot developments predictable, the characters uninteresting and even QT's supposedly legendary ear for dialogue is revealed to be made of solid tin - was there ever a worse last line for a major movie? And were there ever so many poor performances in one film from a supposedly major director? Carradine shines only because he rises to the giddy heights of being average in such poor company (Uma is especially bad, and the extremely unflattering photography doesn't help).

KB 1 was an okayish but wildly overlong actioner, but there's nothing here to match the silly but mildly exciting House of Blue Leaves finale. What that means is the big action climax actually happened at the end of another movie or halfway through this one when it's put together. After that, imagination deserts QT, but he just keeps on going like an irritating tin toy that has outstayed its welcome. A poor show, for purists and geeks only.

But, when I left the theater, I was actually dissapointed. This one isn't at all like its predecessor. While the first one had MANY absolutely awesome fighting scenes and had great humor and a great story, this didn't like that one. First off, this one was way too long, and it went too much into detail in the past and training of the Bride. That's where it kind of lost me. Sure, the scene where she fights the Nurse is great, but that's really all. I have to admit, I liked some of the story andd it was a solid movie but was just way too slow moving. Where's the awesome fight scenes? Where's the great humor? I really don't know. and then the fight against Bill just didn't deliver. It was a really average and just weird fight that wasn't like what I had expected. this was a letdown. But, it still deserves 3 and 1/2 stars for one awesome fighting, some very neat moments, and some interesting parts. Also, watch the only deleted scene. It's a really good fight where Bill kcks a**!

1417571,2,B00005AQ65,"I was not thrilled after seeing this in the theatre, therefore not adding Kill Bill 2 to my DVD collection. I think it is alright that I just have one Kill Bill in my DVD collection. In my opinion, Kill Bill 1 was so much better and it is seriously one of my favorite movies. I don't even remember how many times I've watched that movie. I cannot say the same about Kill Bill 2. This movie has its good moments, but I can't sit through it and wait for my favorite scenes (which happen to be very few). Obviously, KB2 is the continuation of the first movie. I'm not going to give out any spoilers here. The styles of the two movies are rather different. I will say that there is less action than KB1, more talking, more of a Western film type feel, less sassiness and quickness to it, less uses of color than KB2, more gritty than KB1. KB2 reminded me of Pulp Fiction and other movies like that. However, KB2 provided a bit more answers to the audience in terms of The Bride and Bill. The acting is fairly good, but some of the dialogue lines seem to be rather ""cornballish"" (more on the Bride's and Bill's part). As for the music...there are some decent songs and backround music that work well. I'd say that even KB1's music was better, KB2 music was still good. I don't know if Tarantino made such a contrast to attract more viewers or made a contrast for the sake of making a contrast so you have one type of genre for the first movie and another type of genre for the second, and as a whole it works well together? There are a lot of people who liked this movie and there are some who didn't. I wouldn't say NOT to see it, but watch it and see if you are a fan or not. So even though I didn't like this movie, I won't dismiss the fact that the directors and the actors put effort into it. Yes, I can appreciate that a lot of work went into making KB2, but I just could not get into it.",1119830400,,1889,4.121951219512195
1417572,4,B00005AQ65,"I have to say that when Pulp Fiction came out, people made a big deal about it.  I had not seen Resevoir Dogs, so I didn't know about the wunderkind Tarantino. So given all that has gone before - what about this movie?  In a few words - its violent, disgusting(eyeball anyone?), visually arresting, a virtual cornocopia of movie genre styles, and about one of the most consistently interesting movies I think I have seen, perhaps ever.  It is just so memorable.

Why?  Kill Bill is a female empowerment, martial arts, revenge B movie, western.  It makes no sense, takes place in a dream world and yet is great.  What can I say.

Uma Thurman is excellent in this movie.  She nails every emotion in the book, but David Carradine is phenomenal.  His charecterization of Bill - the person that the first movie and this one leads to finding and having revenge against - is soo good at being both evil and damn interesting that to say he eats the scenery is an understatment.  Wow. Darryl Hannah and Michael Madsen also give great performances as two more people 'The Bride' seeks revenge against.

The movie is not one big blood fest as I originally thought and heard.  To me it is more like a kid's idea of gore.  It is disgusting, but the horror is more often the product of your mind's imagination.  Yet, there is gore to be sure.

Tarantino is one of the few directors in today's Hollywood with a great sense of visual style.

Kill Bill is truly a unique film.  If your not a fim buff, many things may not make sense.  The training with Pai Mei seems to border on the ridiculous, yet in the context of the martial arts movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon, and others, it seems to fit.  The Five Palm Exploding Heart is stupid, and yet seems at all possible.  The charecters don't seem to exixt in the real world - who cares?

All in all, this is a great movie - memorable and interesting and truly a product of a sick mind.  However, as Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World), a sick mind is a perpetual feast.

1417600,5,B00005AQ65,"I basically forgot about Quentin Tarentino for a number of years. After watching the fantastic ""Reservoir Dogs"" years ago, followed by the even better ""Pulp Fiction"" a couple of years later, Tarentino seemed to drop off the radar. Occasionally, you would see his mug turn up on one of those television talk shows, or hear about him doing an interview somewhere, but his career as a director seemed to have hit the skids. Then he did ""Jackie Brown,"" a film that certainly embodied many of the Tarentino stylistic elements (wrapped around a still foxy Pam Grier), but failed to compare favorably with his two earlier efforts. Fans of the man sat back and waited patiently for his next project, which turned out to be the hyperkinetic ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" followed by the restrained yet equally entertaining ""Vol. 2."" These films reaffirm one essential fact about Quentin Tarentino: he's one of us. What I mean by that is that he's a fanboy of the sort of cheap, cheesy cinema pumped out of diverse locations such as Asia and Italy. The Spaghetti western is what I'm talking about, and chop socky potboilers from the great old days of Hong Kong. It sure is nice to see someone pay homage to schlock cinema.

""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" throttles back on the testosterone fueled antics found in the first film. While that might not sound appealing to viewers who got a kick out of seeing The Bride turn the Crazy 88 into sushi, don't worry. Tarentino knows what he's doing. The Bride is still on her mission to slay her former associates, which in this installment means going after Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and of course the titular Bill (David Carradine). In the course of the hunt, the film treats us to several amusing flashbacks involving The Bride's training regimen under the terrifying Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu), one of the highly trained martial artists who helped Bill and his associates become ace assassins. The scenes here are classic ""young person learns much from the master"" relationships that we've seen in nearly every martial arts film ever made. Even ""The Karate Kid"" employed this technique, minus the general nastiness involved here of course. Anyway, Uma learns how to kick some you know what under the great Pai Mei, including several skills that will of course come in handy later on in the movie. When we aren't watching these flashbacks, we watch in anticipation as The Bride starts the bloodletting with Budd.

While down on his luck and living in a broken down trailer, Budd isn't about to just lie down and accept his fate. He's got a few tricks up his sleeve, primarily burying The Bride alive down at the cemetery, but he also plans on making a boatload of money for defusing this threat for his brother Bill. Enter Elle Driver, the one eyed thug expertly played by Hannah, and a cold betrayal. The ""Kill Bill"" films seem to contain a lot of betrayals, don't they? This one ends in a scene that surprised even me, with Driver incapacitated in Budd's wrecked trailer screaming her head off as The Bride moves on to the final showdown. What happened to poor Daryl Hannah's character must have had a few people in the theater heading for the bathroom. By the time The Bride finally tracks down Bill in Mexico, and also discovers that he has a little secret stashed away there that is sure to upset our heroine, the movie eschews the frenzied action that concluded the first film in favor of a rather sedate series of scenes in which Bill lectures his beloved Beatrix about Superman and the ramifications of that superhero's true identity (!). It's classic Tarentino dialogue, actually, and fits in rather well with the overall story. In fact, this movie thrives on classic Tarentino dialogue, far more than the first one did.

That's not to say there isn't plenty of violent stuff here. The fight between Elle and The Bride is down and dirty gritty. The training with Pai Mei has a few nasty moments, too. But ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is more about filling in the backstory and employing a different style than the one seen in the first film. For example, we better understand why Bill massacred everyone in that church. We also learn more about how Beatrix Kiddo became The Bride. And it becomes fairly obvious quite quickly that something in nearly every scene--dialogue, a character's movement, an outfit--comes from another film, usually low budget classics that only Tarentino and a handful of knowledgeable film geeks would pick up on in one viewing. One of the fun things about his movies is trying to place all the references, and it's no less fun to try to do that here. As for the style, Tarentino uses black and white photography, long camera shots, and several other nifty tricks to infuse this film with a lot of great atmosphere. If Tarentino keeps making stylishly entertaining films like the two ""Kill Bill"" entries, he might just end up a cult legend himself.

Extras on the disc are surprisingly sparse. The best feature is a deleted scene showing Bill beating the living daylights out of a gang of goons while The Bride watches from the sidelines. A behind the scenes feature and some footage tossed in from the film's premiere aren't all that interesting. Who is willing to bet that a super duper, special edition two or three disc set is in the works even as we speak? They'll probably call it a ""Collector's Edition"" like the ""Jackie Brown"" DVD, but it will come down the pike sooner or later. So rent this disc instead of shelling out for the movie twice.

1417614,4,B00005AQ65,"If you came to watch Kill Bill, Volume 2, expecting the same type of flick as Volume 1 you may be disappointed. While Vol. 1 was an action driven romp based on the old kung-fu style of filming, Vol. 2 is a more cerebral driven film based on the old spaghetti-western of the late 60's/early 70's. This is a slower paced movie, and as a result, a better plot-driven movie. You could say Volume 1 was merely a introduction to the main story of Volume 2.

As with Volume 1, we are treated to a storyline that keeps jumping back-&-forth over a four-year period. After the climatic fight scene with O-Ren at the end of Volume 1 we start Volume 2 back at the masacure four years previously. We are finally introduced to Bill ( a voice only in Vol. 1), played nicely by David Carradine. And we get to see in detail the events that lead up to the masacure.

As I stated earlier, Volume 2 is a slower-paced, plot-driven movie. Whereas Vol. 1 had three great fight scenes there is really only one decent fight scene here, between the Bride and Elle Driver (played surprising well by daryl Hannah). This fight probably has the most satisfying ending of all, which I won't give away. Just be forewarned, you could get a wee-bit squemish here. After eliminating Driver from the picture we are finally ready for the showdown between the Bride & Bill.

Unfortunately, here is where the movie begins to drag, just a little. First, we have a scene in a Mexican Brothel where ""Bea"" finds out where Bill is. Then, we see her arrive at the hotel to discover that her daughter is still alive. Although this was a wonderfully played out reunion between Mother & daughter it only leads us to a long drawn-out scene between Bea & Bill where Tarantino must have felt he needed to tie up all loose ends. This part really was almost anti-climatic. We wait through approximately 15 minutes of explaination to see approximately 10 seconds of the climatic fight. It was a just wee-bit disappointing, I'm sorry to say.

As for everyone else...Uma is great as always. I'll admit Darryl Hannah is a bit over-the-top, but I think it works.

1417618,5,B00005AQ65,"(continued from the Kill Bill 1 page)...

Where Volume 1 was Tarantino's homage to old school martial arts films and Japanese pop and cinema culture, Volume 2 is a western.  On the surface, it's easy to think that these are two very different genres of movies but in theme that's not true.  Both deal with revenge.  How many martial arts movies and westerns have you seen where someone has been killed and must be revenged?

The music is another connection to the styles.  In Vol 1, the music is more J-Pop and Japanese style in theme (look at the 5, 6, 7, 8s).  In Vol 2, Robert Rodriguez (director/writer of Desperado, etc) created the music (in fact, he did it for $1 with the intentions that Tarantino would direct a portion of Rodriguez's next movie for $1 which happens to be Sin City.  Make sure to catch that April 1st).  With Rodriguez's flair, the music becomes more western/mexican.

The other connection is that a lot of Asian films are like Tarantino's in that they are non-linear (i.e. The Grudge, etc).  Vol 1 was very non-linear in it's story-telling approach.  Vol 2, being more westernized, is told in a more linear way.  Not to say it doesn't move back in time then to the present, because it does.  But, in comparison to Vol 1, vol 2 is very much more linear.  And herein lies the brilliance of this movie.  Tarantino bridges the two cultures and cinema styles, creating an epic that is part Japanese and part American old West.

In Volume 2 we learn that everything we thought we knew is probably wrong.  By this, I'm referring to Bill.  In Vol 1 Bill is an insidious voice at the other end of the phone, one hand on his sword, moving it up and down.  We hear his raspy voice and that's about it.  He is an pitch black character.  In Vol 2, when we actually see Bill and get to know his character, Tarantino has changed our perspectives.  Yes he is evil, but not only that, he is human.  A lot more human than we are led to believe.  It's creepy and makes his character more real.

The violence is more subdued this time than in the first one.  Where Vol 1 was a blood soaked revenge story, Vol 2 more resembles some of Tarantino's other stories.  It's filled with more awesome dialogue and more story.  Here we learn all of the answers to The Bride's past and how she got to where she was.

There are still some awesome fight scenes.  The Bride's battle with Elle Driver is intense while strangely humorous.  My one complaint is that we have a 3 hour lead up to a very quick battle with Bill.  It's over too fast for me.  I was a bit let down.  Don't get me wrong, HOW it ends is excellent for reasons I won't spoil, but they get to that ending too fast unfortunately.  I was a bit disappointed.  But, that is a quibble in what is truly and excellent saga.  I can't say enough for this series.  It is amazing.",1110931200,2,2831,4.340344168260038
1417619,5,B00005AQ65,"If you're like me, before you buy or rent a film you might check the customer reviews on amazon.com to see what other people thought.  The problem is, everyone has different tastes and different opinions on what is good and what is bad.  If you're a Tarantino fan then you probably have seen this film twenty times and don't need to be sold on it's greatness.  But for those of you out there who haven't studied every scene and memorized every line Mr. Pink ever said in Reservoirs Dogs...here's an honst review on the KING GEEK'S latest masterpeice.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was amazing but seemed a little more exploitive than anything 'ol Quentin had ever done.  The film was just violent and had little plot...it was a straight forward revenge flick that pretty much never trailed from it's inspirations.  I myself am a massive revenge film fan, (check out Rolling Thunder, Man on Fire, Mad Max and King of the Ants) and I have to say that the Bride fighting the Crazy 88 in Vol. 1 was one of the most awesome American produced martial arts action scenes ever captured on film.  Saying that, the film lacked something that Tarantino really unleashed in Vol. 2...power.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 shows us that Quentin has grown up and isn't all about excess and exploitation.  He's not all about violence.  At times in Vol. 2 it felt like it wasn't a Tarantino film because of the emotions that take place in the film.  This film is a lot more dramatic, a lot more epic, and a lot more story and character driven.  SOme of the scenes are so original and so smart and so well directed and acted that it's a wonder why the Academy Awards totally ignored the film at this years Oscars.  Vol. 2 may lack the blood but it's the real guts of what Kill Bill really is.  It's also a homage to Leone's spagetti westerns...half the soundtrack is old Morricone scores from Italian films.  Michael Madsen's character is straight out of an old western.  And then you have the Shaw Brothers tribute with the whole Pei Mei training of The Bride.  This film effected me much more than Vol. 1 did.  Both films are wonderful but Vol. 2 is the one that proves to the world that Tarantino is much more than fancy dialogue and  unforgiving violence.  Look for Quentin's newest project, he directed a scene in the upcoming SIN CITY adaptation in which Benecio Del Toro haunts Clive Owen's Dwight.",1110844800,,2362,4.525943396226415

I liked these films, but will not view them over and over again like I have others.  I guess I just don't enjoy the rock em sock em ultra-viol like I did as a kid, but there also isn't any depth to hold onto here.  Thus, this simply is not as good as Jackie Brown or the inimitable Pulp Fiction.

We return to the beginning when Uma is accepted into the corp of Bad Guys, her training with the Oriental master, her relationship with David Carradine (I use the person not the persona) and others.  Switch to the present and she begins her revenge only to be caught and buried alive.  This is only a brilliant segue into training from an Oriental master which comes to her aid.

The scene with housewife Vivica Fox scored on so many levels, not the least of which was black humor.  But it is Darryl Hannah who nearly steals the show with an incredible performance as the amoral Elle.  Her stumbling, earnest recitation of snake facts from scrawled notes as poor Michael Madsen dies of venom was the stuff of legends.  And how better to follow it up than a fight with Uma in which Elle is left blind, her only companion the viper...absolutely skin-crawling.

But it is the interaction with Carradine (and the daughter) that is the icing on the cake, Carradine, by the way, seems almost made to order for the part of ""Bill"".  Not seen in Part I, he is almost likeable in his matter-of-fact evil incorrigibility.  The film comes full circle as she dispatches her arch enemy/lover using techniques taught by the Oriental master.  Bravo!",1109980800,,1614,4.741935483870968

Darryl Hannahs character was one of my favorites in the movies and her character did not disappoint in vol 2. Bills brother was also great, and he had some memorable scenes, but the final showdown with Bill was a bit of a let down.

The real, snappy dialogue that Tarantino has used to make his movies, particularly Pulp Fiction, worth watching a dozen times was missing.  Vol 2 gets the balance right, containing all the best qualities of any of Tarantino's masterpieces. It's inhabited by surreal people casually saying outrageous things that should curl your hair. David Caradine, the former soft-spoken, confrontation avoiding Kane of Kung Fu, is riveting as the homicidal maniac Bill. No doubt, Caradine's sinister, blood-thirsty Bill is so startling because we cannot entirely displace the gentle Kane from our minds. Still, Tarantino included in both volumes material that should have landed on the cutting room floor.

1417648,4,B00005AQ65,"David Carradine was remarkable.  When I heard he was playing the role of ""Bill"", I was skeptical.  I am a fan of his earlier work as a good guy, lone-ranger type martial artist, but Carradine playing a ruthless assassin?  He was magnificent.  This film allowed us to see that while Uma Therman, the female warrior, was a protagonist, she was not a ""good guy"" and Carradine as the villian was not a ""bad guy.""  Circumstances created their situation.  Tarantino tackled some tough ethics questions on the choices the female warrior undertook (her name being revealed is part of the story so I won't blow it for you!).  We can also empathize with Bill's pain and suffering.  Surprisingly, ultimately this was a warped, twisted love story.  Behind anger, there is pain, behind pain and fear, there is love.  Love can die as we make certain choices in our lives.  Tarantino designed his trademark quirky soundtrack which awakened a lot of new perspectives, to hear the juxtaposition of playful music over scenes of violence.  It made the violence both more and less brutual.  Michael Madsen did a great job of making the lofty revenge quest seem ridiculous, as he was leading his practical day-to-day banal life.  However, underneath that banal life, he still did not relinquish some of his principles.  Daryl Hannah - was comical, and a villain you love to hate.  Good stretch in her acting ability and she carried it off well.  Carradine steals the show though.  Tarantino did not get quite as creative in his style in Vol 2 (not much fusion of other genres and methods to tell his tale), but it was well done.  The wrap up was appropriately bittersweet.  If you like the ""warrior ethic"" and admire those with a ""code of honor"" you might like this film.  If you prefer romantic comedies, this is NOT for you.",1109289600,2,1805,4.721153846153846
1417649,2,B00005AQ65,"I think the main reason Vol 2 is getting so many great reviews is because people are reviewing both movies as one or Because it's a Tarantino flick or both.  I'm a Tarantino fan and I love all his movies, all but ""Foxey Brown"" and of course Kill Bill Vol 2.  The only scenes or ""chapters"" worth watching in this entire movie was the Pai Mei one and The fight with Elle aka California Mountain Snake.  Everything else is just pointless filler.  I will admit that the scene of the ""massacre"" was necessary but dull and hardly worth the fuss.  It would have been better left as a mystery in Vol 1.

But even if Tarantino wanted to add that scene he could have just done it in Vol 1 and also added the other two chapters and shortened the ending (useles super hero talk) and just released it as one full movie instead of trying to cash in on the ""continuation"" fad of filmmaking.  Lord of the Rings had to do it cause it really was a long movie.  But Kill Bill as a two parter was pointless.

The ending of Vol 1 and the start of Vol 2 had me hyped up with the belief that I was in for a bumpy but great ride as The bride takes her revenge on everyone that wronged her until she gets to the final fight with Bill.  But as the movie went on the hype was replaced by utter boredom to nearly screaming in my mind for these useless scenes that drooned on for hours to just stop and move on.  There was no point at all for us to see Bill's brother going to work and talking to the strip club owner.  It was painfuly obvious that this scene is just filler to add bulk to the film.  Then the scene where Kiddo (Uma) go to visit the foreign guy to find out where Bill was, was too long, too drawn out, dull and pointless filler.  I couldn't even understand what the heck he was even saying.  Then after everything she drives on her way to Bill's and I thought, okay the real action is about to begin, this is where she finally Kill's Bill (cause after all isn't that the title?) this is what I've been waiting for.  The final match.  And what do we get?  The dullest most anti-climatic fight scene I've ever seen.  Now I was actually interested in what they had to say to one another once they finally see each other again.  So I didn't mind that scene too much, all but the stupid ""Superman"" theory.  And the little girl was a bad actress but then again she's a kid.  I could have delt with anything in this scene, even the Superman (...) if it had lead to a great final confrontation.  But it didn't.  It feel completely short and flat with Bill going out like a hero.  Heck it kinda makes me wanna see what Bill was doing while Ms. Kiddo was in the coma all that time.  I bet it would have been more interesting than the filler scenes I was forced to watch.

Simply excellent second part of a 2-part cinematic novel done thoughtfully by masterful filmmaker Quentin Tarantino as he brings his trademark style of movies, action, snappy dialog and humor in many successful ways but less gory than it's precessor.

1417660,4,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill, vol. II (Quentin Tarantino, 2004)

The general consensus among fans is that vol. II of Kill Bill is not quite as good as the first (based both on reviews and its standing as I write in the IMDB top 250-- 93 as opposed to 58 for the first film). There is, of course, a vocal minority who violently disagrees. Allow me to add my voice to the minority.

The main criticism of the second film, that it's not as well-paced, is well-taken. I think that would probably have been forgivable to more people if the film had been released as one piece; since I watched them back-to-back, I probably didn't feel the effect quite as acutely, either. Be that as it may, there is so very, very much to like about this film that I ended up liking it quite a bit better than vol. I.

Michael Madsen plays insane, psychotic, extremely damaged characters in Quentin Tarantino films. (Anyone doubting this has never seen Reservoir Dogs, a movie Madsen's character stole right out from under at least four other Oscar-worthy performances.) He continues the trend of not only serious damage, but movie-stealing, in Kill Bill as Budd, a man who gets very little screen time given the duration of the film, but who has the most memorable character for all that. Madsen plays his character as a man of quiet malice who's gone to seed, but still sees himself as being a man of quiet malice. The part is written with the greatest complexity of any part in the film, and is played perfectly. Michael Madsen once again stamps himself as one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and it is he, for the most part, who makes vol. II a better production than the first flick.

There are other things about the movie that really hit hard, too. Revealing any of them would be spoilers, but let's just say that Tarantino manages a real emotional response without having taken any of the Hollywood shortcuts to get there, and that alone in a Hollywood film should be enough to make the critics sit up and take notice. (To be fair, many of them did.) That a product like this could come out of Hollywood is almost enough to give this overly-cynical critic a shred of hope that, between Tarantino and the epidemic of Japanese horror film remakes making scads of dough, some moron sitting in a CEO's seat at some production company is going to say ""you know, here's some solid evidence, finally, that the crap we put out is all wrong, and there's a market for really good films."" Don't hold your breath, but Kill Bill, vol. II, at least put the idea in peoples' faces. Whether they see it or not is still to be seen. ****",1108425600,2,2598,4.497881355932203
1417661,5,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is a movie that will surprise you. As a big fan of 2003's ""Vol. 1,"" I was eager to see the final chapters of the total film. After the film began, I was pretty much in complete shock during the entire viewing. As fast, kenetic, and high energy as ""Vol. 1"" is, ""Vol. 2"" slows down the pace enourmously. Tarantino's decision to decelerate the second half of his ""Kill Bill"" opus was both necessary, and masterful. At the end of ""Vol. 1,"" the audience learns that The Bride's (Uma Thurman) daughter is still alive, while The Bride has believed her to never have been born. This is a clever device which serves two purposes: It gives the audience a terrific cliff-hanger at the end of ""Vol. 1,"" but also sets an appropriate pace for ""Vol. 2."" Not only do we now that The Bride is on a collision course to finding out the truth about her daughter, but that there's no way she can prepare for said revelation. However, Tarantino brilliantly gets both the audience and The Bride ready for this confrontation through a more dramatic and heart-felt ""Vol. 2"" of his epic. By slowing the pace and theming of his second film, most of which takes place in the barren desert of the South-West United States as opposed to frenetic Tokyo, Japan of ""Vol. 1,"" Tarantino forces The Bride, relax and take time to realize the path of revenge that she has chosen. In the end, it's an astonishing piece.",1108339200,5,1399,4.490196078431373
1417662,2,B00005AQ65,"The good news with Kill Bill, Volume 2 is it isn't as mixed up as Volume 1. Tarantino took his critics to heart and cut back from Volume 1's habit of changing genres every other scene. Volume 2 also cut back a little on the annoying flashbacks. The bad news is, with the exception of a well done scene near the end (it's a twist so I won't give any more details), the film is quite dull. Other than Uma Thurman, you'll find better acting in a daytime soap opera. David Carradine who hides in the shadows of Volume 1 unfortunately is featured in Volume 2. The man can't act. And, judging from the one scene deleted from the movie (see bonus material), his action days are over as well. The cut fight scene he's in is an embarassment beyond the obvious attempt at humor in parodying bad Kung Fu movies. Mercifully, the spraying blood is gone but Tarantino's sadism is only mildly contained. I was so eager for this dog to end I fast-forwarded through most of the last 1/3 of the movie. Be careful if you do this though or you'll speed by the brief, disappointing showdown between The Bride and Bill in the end. Suffering through both volumes for a meager payoff is the final insult.

We know now that the Bride's real name is Beatrix Kiddo (nice bit of tongue-in-cheek) and Umas Thurman long, lanky style fits the role perfectly. Michael Madsen is terrific as Bill's brother, Budd. And David Caradine is an instant classic as Bill. Again, Tarantino builds great individual scenes, including the last fight between Beatrix and Elle (Daryl Hannah), the black mamba bit, Bill's analysis of comic book superhero character-types, and the entire burial alive chapter. My friends felt a bit cheated that the showdown between the Bride and Bill wasn't a cataclysmic samurai sword scene, but I thought the rather understated Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique was a perfect, unexpected Tarantino ending.",1106697600,,905,5.080536912751678

With Carradine gave this punch-line ""Baby, you ain't kidding"" before the grand final battle. It almost killed me with laughing but Quentin didn't give me enough time enjoy it, he threw in the sword-fight and fist-fight immediately. Luckily for me, I watched DVD so I could rewind it. ;-)

And the conversation between Thurman and Carradine is masterfully written in both the living room and patio.

I believe Quentin could pull out Kill Bill 3 and Kill Bill 4 as well as Kill Bill Episo One easily.

Carradine's act is favorite one since Tommy Lee Jones in MIB when he bought the Tabloid at the counter and when he accepted the drink offer from the lady at the farm house. So funny and so professional. ;-)

A few points I observed from this movie:

1) 2 seemingly unrelated scenes: killing Bill and killing Elle. We know Kiddo would kill Bill at the end but how? The whole 2 movies revolving around the Hanzo's sword. Then it had been what we all anticipated. Then Kiddo poked out Elle's last eye after Kiddo questioned Elle about the first lost eye (Mei Pei did it). I could not realize it until now that it was an introduction to the ultimate technique that he taught her. And she kept it secretly so that she could use on Bill at the end. (See human complexity below.)
2) Long fight between Bill and Kiddo: we all waited to see a long violent fight between them. It didn't happen but it DID happen. The whole 2 movies are about how Bill tried to kill Kiddo violenly but unsuccessfully. Then he stacked up the killers to stop her.
3) Bill did not want to kill Kiddo: he stopped Elle when she was about to kill Kiddo in the hospital in the first movie. He could just kill her by gun when they were in the living. Or ordered Budd to terminate Kiddo. And so on.
4) Bill is a complex person: He admitted he was a murdering bastard. He confessed he was so upset when he felt betrayed by Kiddo. He took on the job of single-dad. He didn't try to kill Kiddo after the first time, he just tried to stop her from killing him.
5) Quentin deleted one very good scene: I guessed the blood flowing was so ""ridiculous"" to even Quentin's standard. ;-) But on the first movie, he showed Lucy Liu with half of her brain exposed... ;-) What a sicko! ;-) (Great job, man!) And Thurman looked the best in that deleted scene. Wow!
6) It's about a love story: At the end, Kiddo and Bill still had feeling for each other.
7) Quentin admitted that the whole movie is almost all about Bill. His purpose is for the generation after Kung Fu will remember Carradine as Bill, not as Kwai Chang Caine.",1106611200,3,2622,4.373716632443532

At least, that is what I have found. It creates 'catharsis' (involves the audience through feelings of fear and pity)! Indeed, it's not a movie you can just watch at any old moment, or too soon again afterward, or view lightly. And I can't put on Volume 1 without seeing it through to completion within a short time. It takes a very special kind of film to have this sort of effect on me personally, and I find these two halves of a whole film to be just the right type; therefore I heartily recommend them to all who consider watching it but haven't yet. It's heavy, high-powered, charged, and flows from one monumental scene to another almost without consideration for the viewer. And superb quotes? There are too many to count.

This film is quieter than the first, much to its detriment.  Volume 1 managed to overcome writer/director Quentin Tarantino's directorial gimmicks and stilted dialogue during its many inspired action scenes.  Here, the gimmicks remain but there is less action to redeem it.  Something in me still responds to his characters, but I think Tarantino is well on his way to being the most overrated director of our time.  The long, geeky speeches that seemed fresh in ""Pulp Fiction"" are tipping over the border into self-parody (although I did think that David Carradine's speech about Superman toward the end was brilliant; whoever makes the next movie about the Man of Steel should take note).

For starters, the pace of 'Volume 2' is extremely slow. 'Volume 2' didn't feel like a movie as much as a bunch of scenes strung together to make a second film. Some of the scenes of 'everyday things and moments' that were charming and innovative in past Tarantino films fall flat here. You can tell the editors of 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' were trying to stretch out the movie so they could have two films (it was origonally intended to be one movie) and kept in a lot of scenes/moments that would have normally been edited out.

To makes matters worse, the acting is atrocious. I overlooked the poor acting in 'Volume 1' largely because the plot and dialogue were so good. However, without those elements in the sequel, the poor acting comes to the surface. Most of the performances feel forced and some (Thurman & Carradine in particular) are plain bad. I now realize why Carradine hasn't had much of a career after KungFu and was Tarrantino's third choice to play Bill.

Finally, many of the devices that Tarantino has borrowed from other films in the past to great effect don't work here. They feel cliched and forced. In particular, the music borrowed from the Sergio Leone trilogy was out of place and the normally inventive camera shots (shoes instead of faces for example) were tiresome and felt they were being done just to be 'different' and 'cool.'

I was shocked that 'Volume 2' got primarily stellar reviews. But as a  Tarantino fan, I felt this movie showed that the makers were trying to get a few extra bucks at the expense of quality by stretching one film into two.

If you've not seen the movie, and don't want to know what happens, stop reading now.

I really enjoyed watching this movie but I think that the fascinating character of Pei Mei should've been given more depth. I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous.

Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it. That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me. I did like the credits with the cross-out motif. That was creative.

I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring. I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character. Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something. I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate.

Anyone who has seen the ads of the film know that Elle and The Bride have their battle in a mobile home in the desert.  In fact, most of the action of the film takes place in and around this trailer, as it happens to be owned by Bud, who also meets his fate there.  The Elle/Bride battle is, in fact, the only large-scale fight scene in the film.  The pace is much slower with significantly more dialogue than Vol. 1. This is to my liking - Tarantino shines his brightest when his characters are serving up their versions of philosophy.  Especially brilliant is Bill's exposition on the difference between Spider-man and Superman, as pertains to their secret identities.

Much is answered in this film - how Elle lost her eye, how the Bride became such an efficient killing machine (and why she fled Bill's group), and we even learn the Bride's real name.  Other things are never explained - why everyone hates Bill so much, for example.  There are few surprises - the audience is likely to be ahead of the plot.  However, such is Tarantino's editing technique and dialogue pacing that the plot is never important - it's not about what happens so much as how it happens.  And there are a couple genuine surprises that are all the more effective after thinking you have everything figured out.

This is a fine movie, and a worthy second part (not sequel) to the first.  Although my favourite individual scene (the escape from the hospital) is in Vol. 1, there is more in Vol. 2 that is memorable, because it's more dialogue driven.  I wonder if Tarantino plans to recut the films and mix up the scenes in some future special edition version?

On that note, I will repeat the warnings of some others - don't bother buying this DVD.  Mirimax is notorious for their crappy first-release DVD's, and both Vol. 1 and 2 have no worthwhile extras (although a cut scene of a fight between Bill and an unidentified assailant is mildly interesting).  Since the films work as a whole, wait until the special edition set comes out.  I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.",1103414400,4,2470,4.547511312217194

Thurman is one the most attractive actress on the screen in the world . she irradiates magnetism , force and credibility to the film as any other actress in this exigent role

Purveyors of ketchup and fake body parts are exstatic. The fight scenes are just as unrealistic as those of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but entirely lack their grace and elegance, with one exception. The exception being Lucy Liu's excellent performance.
One scene has fastened in my mind's eye: Lucy Liu at the head of her warriors, seen from the side and in silhouette. She, in a white long kimono, holding her black sheathed sword at her side, striding/gliding in a manner conditioned by her Japanese sandals; they, all in black.

I've had discussions with friends who think the 2nd volume is better, and their main argument is that Vol 2 ""has more plot!""

Let's make a distinction: Plot and dialogue are NOT THE SAME. Both have the same plot.  That's why it's a two volume movie.

The choreography was better in the 1st Vol.  The cinamatography is way(!) better in the 1st (Consider the final showdown between Thurman and Lucy Liu -- case-in-point.)  And let's face it:  It was way more Tarantino-esque than the 2nd Vol.

But the 2nd Vol does have pros:  If you've seen the 1st, you MUST see the 2nd.  Admit it, you need the closure!  The 2nd does a nice job of putting everything in its place without being too over-explanatory.  Also, character development.  The dialogue and background scenes are needed to develop the characters, and make it more personal for the audience.  Also, it's very funny to see Michael Madsen play a let-himself-go loser, when we're so used to seeing him as the badass guy you love to hate!",1102377600,4,1234,4.622119815668203

In this installment qt dwells more into the story background, reveals who bill is, shows the training Beautrix went through before becoming the words deadliest women, oh yeah it reveals her name (BEAUTRIX).

Different from volume 1, volume two brings in some family loves after beautrix finds her daughter, Beautrix is a much more likable character in vol 2, the movie makes you accually feal sorrow for her shows what she really has undernief the whole killing thing. I have to be honest volume two has no where near as much action as vol 1 so it is important that you watch the first installment first just to get a feal for the story, the movie still entertains to the full extent.

Volume 2 has all the great camera shots of Uma's battle face and still uses the japanamation on some flashback scenes so don't worry the movie deffinately hasn't lost itself. The movie is fit with a great soundtrack and some great fighting scenes, after a whole lot of crap happening to her Beautrix finally makes it to her key objective and i'll leave it to you to find out what happens there.

Therefore, I will rate it as a whole. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the dialogue, said to be Tarentino's strongest point, is snappy. Lucy Liu (""Charlie's Angels,"" ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"", etc), Vivica A. Fox (""Independence Day,"" ""Two Can Play That Game), Daryl Hannah (""A Walk To Remember,"" ""Silver City"", etc), Michael Madsen and David Carradine play the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) of whom The Bride (aka Black Mamba) (Uma Thurman, in a knockout role) was once queen bee and whom Bill (Carradine, scary as hell) has ordered to be executed at her wedding...really. She wakes up four years later, plotting bloody revenge...and she gets it: ""A roaring rampage of revenge. I roared, I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction."" This movie is one of the best films that feature chicks kicking a-- and a whole lot of action. Special features include a performance by the 5, 6, 7, 8's (who appear in the film), a deleted scene (without Tarantino's commentary, for some reason) and more.

What a shock for me, this is one disjointed Tarantino film and I can't belive that Uma Thurman even read the script before signing on.

He then told me that maybe I should give it 2 or 3 stars to avoid that absolute pounding my feedback ratings are going to get from the Tarantino/Thurman fans ...

Tarantino is a film genious and after taking a couple years rest, he is back at it with the Kill Bill series which is his best.

Kill Bill Vo. 1 was all about blood and gore, so I was expecting Kill Bill Vol. 2 to show more.

However after seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2 I realized that it was not, the second part of the story is all about developing the plot.

Although violence only occupies a few scenes, it does not make Vol. 2 worse by any means.

The characters are intriguing and their performances stunning, and we finally get a glimpse into what started this story that is so cunning.

Although this movie won't be nominated for any awards it is certainly deserving, I guess that the violence and the premise is a little too unnerving.

So if there is only one movie that you choose to see, I highly recommend that Kill Bill Vol. 2 it should be.",1100131200,6,960,4.213114754098361
1417691,3,B00005AQ65,"While watching this movie, I had many moments of dispair and joy at the same time. If you have seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, don't expect the same kind of movie. While Vol. 1 was a nod to martial arts flicks, this is more of a Quentin movie. When I say that, I mean there is much more dialogue and character building. But after seeing both of these movies, I don't think either one does what it's set out to do as well as it could have.

I must say, I am a HUGE Quentin Tarantino fan. I love all of his movies and he is one of my idols in the movie industry. But with the fact that everyone kisses(...)like it's gold, you run the risk of the man getting cocky. The Kill Bill' saga shows me that. There should have never been two seperate movies here. It should have just been one 3-hour flick that would have been excellent. Instead we are left with one movie that had tons of action, but no character development. The other movie has tons of character development (and dialogue) and not enough action. That is not to say that I don't like these movies, but I just think cutting into two volumes was a bit pretentious on Quentin's part.

Vol. 2 is still an enjoyable movie and it's more in-line with Quentin's previous work. The writing is sharp and it's got some really great scenes. Uma Thurman deserves SOOO much credit for playing the role of ""The Bride"". If this would have been condensed into one movie, she could have an oscar on her mantle for this. The revenge story that started in Vol. 1 continues here, as Uma hunts down the last three assassins responsible for the massacre.

Like I said earlier, Uma is amazing here again. Her fight scene with Daryl Hannah is great. She shows all the range here as she does emotional & revenge in the same scene. I was very impressed by her. David Carradine surprised me here, as well. Quentin has a knack of rejuvenating actors' careers and apparently it was Carradine's turn. He plays the villain in a very swarmy, calm, and cool way. Daryl Hannah looks unbelievable & kicks absolute ass here. The battle between her and Uma was the highlight of the action in the film. When she is talking to a dying Budd (Michael Madsen), and reading him a description of the Black Mamba snake is genius. It's my favorite scene in the movie.  Michael Madsen will shock you here. He plays a chubby loser for most of the movie, but gets the upper hand on Uma. The acting throughout the movie is excellent. Quentin seems to bring the best out of his actors on a consistant basis and it continues here.

I know I have complained for half the review, but this still is a good movie. I was just disappointed because I can tell what movie Quentin COULD'VE (and should've in my opinion) made and it frustrates me. There is also no pay-off with the ending. I won't give it away, but I was less than thrilled. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit up to the very end, but it's just missing something. I know a lot of you are going to disagree with me, but go watch Quentin's other movies (even True Romance, which he wrote) and tell me where this ranks. You may agree with me.

Special Features: Well, we all know there will be some special edition of these two movies someday, so I wasn't expecting a lot of supplements here. There is the same type of featurette that was on Vol. 1's DVD. It's pretty good and not your typical crappy, studio-style documentary. There is one deleted scene, which I thought should've been in the movie. I mean Quentin can't cut out A TON of stuff that didn't have to be there, but then he cuts a scene where Carradine gets to kick some ass? Makes no sense. There is also a CHINGON music performance. CHINGON is headed by Robert Rodriguez (Quentin's best friend). While I like Rodriguez's movies, I didn't need live concert footage on my DVD of him.",1099785600,4,3802,4.378186968838527
1417692,5,B00005AQ65,"The thing is, this isn't really a sequal, but it is merely a continuation to what was unfinished in the first half. ""Kill Bill"" is all one movie, but based on the difference in content, it could be easily misunderstood that these are two different movies. I gave ""Kill Bill Volume One"" five stars, and called it one of the best of the year. I loved this movie, even better than the first part, and it is because of the content. At this point, I've seen this movie at least fifteen times, and everytime it doesn't seize to amaze me. It has some of the most insightful dialogue, the most amazing music, and the terrific acting of not one, not two, but four different people. Out of both of the movies, I found one scene in each that I could have lived without, and that is in four hours of material. Director Quentin Tarrantino has a way with words, and this movie completely proves that.

This part picks up right where the first one left off. Uma Thurman plays The Bride, or the Black Mamba. As the Black Mamba, she was one of the top assassins in the world, and she worked for Bill. She decides to leave the organization, The Deadly Viper Assassation Squad, and Bill is fine with it, until at her wedding, Bill and four other killers come in to crash the wedding. They kill all the quests, and shoot her in the head. She was also pregnant with Bill's child. She is left in a coma, wakes up, and starts her revenge. In the first part she gets to two of the killers, and now there are two left, and then to the big guy. . . Bill. She is faced to defeat Michael Madson, who plays Budd, and Daryll Hannah, who playes Elle Driver. She does face many problems along the way, including being buried alive by Budd, kicked, spit on, attacked, and emotionally hurt, especially by the shocker that takes place in the end.

I could understand why people wouldn't like ""Kill Bill Volume Two."" Alot of people I know hated it compared to the first one. The first does have a bloody action climax, and this one only had about one major fight scene. This movie is very verbal, and it paves the way for much character development. In this movie, we are able to see the remaining killers as people, and a more in dept look at the wedding sequence. It takes about twenty-five minutes to get to The Bride's return, as we are treated to the social and working life of Budd. There is also a classic twenty minute scene showing the training of The Bride, shown in classic homage to the old Japanese movies.

In recap, ""Kill Bill"" as one big movie is an great movie experience, but this ""Vol. 2"" works as a great substitute. It may not have the action that the first movie included, but this one is so much more memorable. Quentin Tarrantino also picks the best music to play in his movies, and this one is no exception. It was much more instramental, and it was darkly haunting. David Carradine steals the show in his scenes, and the final act, during his monolouges, he says his words in perfect pronouceation. I personally nominate him for Best Actor next year. ""Kill Bill Volume Two"" is one of the best movies of the year, close to the top.

ENJOY!

1417693,5,B00005AQ65,"One of the first things that struck me about Kill Bill 2 is how Tarantino seems to have aimed it at a subtly different audience. The first was both a paean and a parody of the Hong Kong style fight film and the anime style that is part and part of the same package. This film is something else - in some ways it is almost a commentary on the forces behind the making of part one, and an opportunity for Tarantino, speaking through Bill (David Carradine), to express some of his aesthetics directly to a willing audience.

This makes it a somewhat headier film as it traces The Bride's (Uma Thurman) progress towards their inevitable confrontation. The first part of the film, told in the context of a live burial covers confrontations with both Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah). The best acting here is a surprise performance by Chia Hui Liu, who plays Pai Mei, a perfect parody of a Chinese master of the martial arts. In many ways, these sequences are some of the best in the film, and they crystallize what is happening to The Bride (also known as Beatrix Kiddo) in the present.

That part done, the action turns to the hunt for Bill and Bea's discovery of her child (mentioned at the end of Kill Bill 1). This is the point where Tarantino shifts gears, spending as more time on emotional and intellectual questions than he does on actual violence. This makes an interesting contrast, and those who were expecting an explosive conclusion may find that this time they are a bit nonplussed. There is a moment of blurring action, but this adheres more to the Samurai model where the actual stroke occurs in a moment, almost as a side effect of the dramatic content.

What makes this all exceptional is that Tarantino to what was an absolutely predictable plot and manages to make each movement full of surprise and seeming free will. Tarantino shows himself a master of camera styles and choreography to the same effect, focusing this time on more intimate spaces. The physical acting is also notable (especially the fight scene between Elle and The Bride). The two films in this series make an interesting study of the palette of one of our more unorthodox directors.",1099440000,27,2197,4.657216494845361
1417694,3,B00005AQ65,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment, of Tarantino's quirky homage to ultra violence, spaghetti westerns, and martial arts movies, and was looking forward to this closing sequel. I gave 3.5 stars and that really is a stretch, the pace and absorbing direction of the first explosive film have seemingly evaporated. This is way way way tooooooo long, with overdone scenes, close ups and dramatic music, in an attempt I presume to give an artistic flair and fill in the drama. A fair amount of back story though essential is also overly protracted, and the end result leaves you feeling a little cheated. Were this a stand alone sequel, you could be more forgiving, but as an original single movie broken into two volumes, this is a let down. I think it was right to break the movie up, but whereas the first movies 111 minutes flew by, this marathon 137 minutes drags annoyingly. It seems as though the editing room went into overdrive in an attempt to ""pad out"" this movie which has a very large ""filler scenes"" feel to it. I did enjoy seeing the story close out, but would have enjoyed it much more with more action, less talk, and about 30 minutes less running time.

Where Vol. 1 is mostly action scenes and flashbacks; Vol. 2 deals with a much more defined storyline and the character's present situation. Another fun ride from Tarentino and definitely a must see!

1417696,5,B00005AQ65,"After the depressing disappointment with Vol. 1, Tarrantino certainly delivered with Vol. 2, as all of the filmmaker's signatures can be recognized: unique plot construction, an uncanny understanding of the dark side of human nature, humorous irony and a gift for creating truly inimitable characters. Many would probably disagree, but the first instalment bordered on the schizophrenic: a cacophony of blood, comic book characters and an infantile plot that an elementary student would dream up - not so with Vol. 2. This film was interesting and well executed. Tarrantino found himself in this film; one can see that he thought it through, leaving his true fans with the feeling that his reputation as a director of genius remains solidly in tact.

All the cast put in great performances. David Carradine as Bill was executed with pure panache, and Uma Thurman as Beatrix Kiddo could not have been done any better. One could see she loved playing this character and totally submerged herself in the role without taking it too seriously. Uma is a beautiful woman and the director captured this beauty in every shot.

One cannot write a review of this film without mentioning the soundtrack. Director Robert Rodriguez, (One upon a Time in Mexico) has written some passionate music for the film. If you enjoy high intensity, atmospheric Latin guitar, then this soundtrack will send you straight to your `wish list' button at the top of the page. Tarrantino is known for his great soundtracks, but this one tops the list without question. Rodriguez is not only a talented director but also a gifted composer and musician. His music only added to the overall impact of the film.

After Vol. 1, my faith in Tarrantino waned considerably, however, after seeing Vol. 2, I have returned to the faithful and look forward to his next project.",1099180800,2,1833,4.983660130718954

They are both some of the worst movies put to film in a long long time.

If you only like action and blood and don't want any real story, acting, dialouge, character development, or intelligence then this is the movie for you. If you like any of those things though in a movie avoid this like you'd avoid a rampaging bull.

The plot is one that has been used 1000's of time before, someone close to someone gets killed and now that someone is out for revenge...wow...so original Now had the action been better or the acting or anything at all for that matter I could have overlooked this, but nothing is good here.

The action looks more like a saturday cartoon (just with more blood), and the blood, I can actually see the hoses that are used to shoot it out of the peoples limbs when they are cut off...sad, so sad.

And last...the soundtrack (you can't really call it a score0 it's horrible. Pure crap. Just like the movie, avoid this movie people, don't even bother.",1098489600,7,1230,4.381578947368421

But I can't. And then along comes Kill Bill in two volumes to make me feel even worse. People rave about these movies! But I think they both stink; the second one worse than the first. ""... breathtakingly cinematic epic""? No it's not. ""... fueled by iconic images""? ... of a Kharman Gia's front end driving past a dry south-western landscape? No, not that, either.

First of all, a martial arts movie with the original Grasshopper in the central role? How hackneyed is that? And swords? Professional killers use swords? Remember Bruce Lee's comment that if you're worried about self defense, you shouldn't learn Kung Fu, you should buy a gun?

And at least with Charlie's Angels we go into the movie knowing it's a farcical exploitaition film; Tarantino has his eyes on philosophy. Yuck.

There are too many scenes which waste time. I hated Kill Bill 1 because of its lack of depth and sadistic violence but believe it or not, the best part is the gory fight between Elle and the Bride.

I love the way they ended to movie... i did not want the fight between BIll and THE BRIDE to be so long and overdone... it was quick and to the point....

  First, I think we all remember what happened in the first movie, we don't need a whole cheesy explanation in the beginning.  You could have at least given us a seperate narrarator, we don't need Uma Therman talking to the camera, it detracts from the film.

  Next, the style wasn't bad, black and white in some scenes works for me... to a limited extent, but some people (David Carrandine) don't have the face for such high detail.

  Holy mother of God, did she just fly?  This was the first time I almost got up and left.  You'll know it when you see it, its just terrible.

  Pai Mei is the worst character ever.  I mean it, he is awful, he has some crazy magic powers, and this time I really stood up and started walking away, but my friends made me sit down and watch more.

  Elle's other eye scene is hott.  Trust me on this one.  The Bride vs. Elle (Darryl Hannah) is the best fight in the movie.

  The scene with the latino guy is pointless and serves no purpose other than filler.

  The end battle is totally anti-climactic and left me wanting more.  It was lame, and uneventful.  There was no twist, no shock, no excitement, and I consider it a cop-out.

  Overall, I think the movie could have been better if a good 95% of it were just edited out.  I'm serious, it made me want to cry that it was soooo disappointing compared to the first.",1097884800,5,1580,4.279863481228669

If you could remember the first volume, it was depicted in many styles and I was happy to inform you all that the second volume was a continuation of that.  Quentin said it well that whilst first volume was paying homage to the Eastern elements and second volume was paying homage to the Western elements.  The soundtrack was done by Robert Rodriquez (of Marichi's fame) and it fitted this movie very well.  For (violent) movie enthusiasts, I couldn't say this enough, this movie was made by someone who was passionate about his craft!  For those that missed Quentin's dialogues as we witnessed in Pulp Fiction, we gotta see heaps in this offering.  As David Carradine explained in the behind-the-scene, Quentin's movies were never about violence but providing us with an insight of how bad people ticked.  Thus, his willingness to partake in this project.  Gordon Liu was back second time around to play Pai-Mei (a bad arse kung-fu master who taught the Bride her martial arts skill).  This movie contained a lot of surprises like cameo appearances by the least expected persons, additional footage if you are willing to wait to the VERY end of credits, and we got to find out the real name of the Bride's name!  Highly enjoyable and truly watchable.  You would be crazy to miss this one.  Strictly for the Quentin's fans only",1097798400,2,1482,4.78740157480315

Bill got jealous when his Bride dumped him for another guy?  How mundane can you get?  Well, I guess it's as good a reason as any, but why did Bill have to take out the whole wedding party?  Talk about overkill...

Okay, I have a problem with the underlying motives, but ""Kill Bill 2"" is as stylish as its predecessor, without all the carnage.  The cast is superb.  David Carradine makes a predictably revolting Bill, but the movie is stolen by Liu Cha Hui as the Bride's sadistic tutor Pai Mei; the sequence which shows the Bride's training under this spellbinding maniac is easily the best thing in the film.

The other sequences showing the Bride getting revenge on Bill's assassination team are pretty good on their own; there is something deliciously satisfying about the Bride popping out Daryl Hannah's one good eye instead of killing her outright, leaving her blind for the rest of her life and probably wishing she had been killed instead.  But the final sequence, showing the Bride reunited with her offspring, somehow doesn't jibe with the rest of the movie; it's hard to reconcile the image the Bride as a doting mommy beside that of an obsessed killing machine.  But ""Kill Bill"" was never about substance; it's all about style, and on that basis it can stand on its own any day.  Like its predecessor, it doesn't measure up to ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino's masterpiece, but it's great fun in its own right.",1097366400,10,1650,4.578231292517007

On the most obvious level, of course, this is a very violent and visceral film. It's full of the same mix of innovative brutality and crazy humor that marks QT's standout scenes. Look past that, though, and you'll see that motivation behind all the events in the film is uniquely female. The story and character came from a collaboration with Uma Thurman, and we don't know who came up with what. No matter, though - this movie will repulse you, scare you, make you laugh, might make you cry, and will make you like and understand both the hero (Thurman as the Bride) and the villian (an amazingly charming David Carradine as Bill.)

This is why, I think, that Tarantino's films resonate so much - they work on a number of diffent levels, and that gives them a richness and depth that isn't obvious at first viewing. Pulp Fiction is really about the consequences of not following God. Kill Bill is about the difference between men and women.",1097280000,3,1136,4.483091787439614

My favorite scene was when she fights the Crazy 88's, which is weird for me, because I don't usually like fight scenes. Plus the music in Volume 1 was far superior with the Tomoyasu Hotel and Nancy Sinatra and all that. The second one was pretty damn good, though, (although I still can't watch the beginning when she gets shot...eek...too real for me). The fight with Elle definitely kicked some serious arse and when she meets B.B. is heart-wrenching, but there was a lot of Quentin's trademark dialogue in it, which, IMO, was a little overdone, i.e. the wedding rehearsal.

From the very opening with the haunting piano....it seemed like it was destined to more than the action-fest of the first installment.  We're treated to the full story of how the 'wedding massacre' went down proving that the event was far more brutal and traitorous than any of us could of imagined.

The biggest questions of all left from vol. 1 (why and why, to certain issues) are all wrapped up nicely here.  Bill, is sadistic and insane, of course; but he might not be the cold-blooded psycho we expect him to be.

1417726,3,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a good film, but it's not great and this is probably due to the producers forcing Tarantino to split Kill Bill up into two films instead of his originally envisioned one and I have to say that this was an incredible mistake.

The visuals are dazzling, and instead of the predominantly samurai with western influences, we find ourselves walking through more of a western influenced by the way of the samurai.

A primary issue I find here is the dialogue. There is a constant need to go back to the original, or looking through backstory, and as I watch I feel like saying, ""we know this already, let's get to the meat of the film."" When the film actually gets going, it's incredibly entertaining but on a number of occasions everything just seems to stop, and it can't be blamed on the out-of-sequence filming that Tarantino is known for. In Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction there is a flow even with the irregular sequence.

In Kill Bill vol. 2, we actually feel out of sequence and the flow stops at times.

For me, it just simply feels like the two films should have been allowed to be released as one. Tarantino's editing of the second volume looks rushed, perhaps from his extreme displeasure of having to split up what he felt was his masterpiece. I think if the two were combined, Kill Bill could very well have been that. Instead, I just find myself watching the first one and never truly reaching for the sequel.

In my opinion, the above-average but not perfect Volume 2 is flawed but should not be attributed to Tarantino. This is a prime example of what happens when Executive Producers think they can make films better than Directors.

You're still on my good list, Q.",1097107200,2,1700,4.557377049180328
1417727,4,B00005AQ65,"It would be close to impossible to top ""Vol. 1"" in the gore / action department, and fortunately Q didn't try.  In Vol. 2 we get much more character development and the violence is less physical than psychological (e.g., discussing with your daughter in childlike language how you shot her mother in the head).  All in all, two great movies well worth full price.

My only complaint is the classic ""Don't mess around with your victim when you have her down; kill her immediately like anyone with an ounce of common sense would"" complaint that is common to the genre.  But then again, maybe this wasn't clichd writing by Q, but rather deliberate homage.  With Q, who can tell the difference?",1097107200,2,690,4.669421487603306

No, the body count isn't as high in this second half, no the squirting geysers of blood aren't present this time around and yes, the dialouge (A Tarantino hallmark)is a dominant factor this time around, and that's the whole point! The story and the emotional payoff are what matters most, and they are handled brilliantly. The flashbance sequence; THE CRUEL TUTELAGE OF PAI MEI, is some of the most virtuostic filmmaking ever committed to celluoid and is worth the price of admission alone. The final showdown in the hotel room between the Bride and another assassin is classic Quentin and reminded of the dark tension and mood of his earlier films.

1417730,4,B00005AQ65,"In a continuation of a story first told in first volume, director Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill vol. 2 is a tale built on revenge, love, and family. The story begins in the same place as its predecessor: in that El Paso wedding chapel where the villainous title character (David Carradine) left his nameless prot -assassin (Uma Thurman) with a bullet in her head. From here, Thurman's character, the Bride continues on her quest to hunt down those responsible for this shameless act and repay them through their own death. Woven around the scenes of revenge, Tarantino weaves back story. Explanations of why the Bride and her wedding party where objects of a team of assassins anger, why the Bridewanted to kill Bill, and what happened to the child the Bride was carrying at the wedding chapel.

  Tarantino builds Vol. 2 around his trademarks: dialogue and music. This helps to provide us with the exposition and the kind of quiet down moments missing from Vol. 1. Here, the characters stop to talk, and Tarantino has written some witty repartee that brings even more sophistication to his sophisticated commingling of your basic film noir and ""woman scorned"" melodramas with Sergio Leone-style spaghetti Westerns, blaxpolitation flicks of the 1970s and kung fu flicks of the '80s. This combined with Robert Richardson's cinematography makes this film outstanding, you can get lost in the sumptuous and varied beauty of his photography. Moving back forth between movie present and movie past allows one to understand the angst shown by Thurmans character in the first volume. While containing some violent and some down right frightening scenes, Tarantino uses flashbacks to breakup the violence and explain how certain circumstances arise or are overcome.

  While the first volume was a bloodbath, volume two ends up being a story of love and family. It could be seen as a story of a woman overcoming great odds to settle a number of scores and bring together a family.",1096675200,5,1972,5.015290519877676

In answering those questions, we get a sense of how evil Bill is and how richly he diserves his fate.  The most violent part is during the showdown between the Bride and the one-eyed blonde which has got to be one of the most exiting fight scenes that I have seen this year.

Kill Bill Vol. 1 was SUCH a great film; action-packed, thrilling, inventive, sexy and funny.

Kill Bill Vol. 2, on the other hand, is a bore. Tedious and childish.

1417748,2,B00005AQ65,"It should be remembered that ""Kill Bill"" is essentially one movie split into two out of running length necessity; the (rather sensible) logic was that NO ONE would be able to take in a single feature that ran 248 minutes (just over 4 hours) in length.

So what you have is a similar situation with ""Kill Bill"" as with Tarantino's last full-length film ""Jackie Brown""; a good movie that (in my opinion) simply runs too darn long.

""Kill Bill"" peaked with ""Volume 1"", a movie that ran at just under two hours but seemed to go by much quicker, ham-fisted dialogue notwithstanding.  ""Volume 2"" is actually over two hours but seems to go by a third as fast.  ""Volume 2"" features much more introspection and less action than ""Volume 1""...and as a result the plot just drags.  Introspection is well-used in a movie where there is a level of intrigue involved (see prior Tarantino examples ""Reservoir Dogs"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"" to a degree), but in an action spectacular like ""Kill Bill"" it does nothing but slow things down...BADLY.  The flashback sequences do this movie no favors (unlike ""Volume 1"", where the flashback involving Oren Ishii actually was one of that movie's true highlights), and the personalities of the remaining ""deadly vipers"" simply aren't as powerful as those slain (perhaps prematurely, in terms of plot pacing) in the first movie.

That in itself could perhaps be forgiven...but the final act is such a tremendous letdown.  What should have been an epic battle between two warriors built up over nearly four hours of screentime as demigod-like figures is unforgiveably underdone.  David Carradine once infamously got on martial arts/action cinema icon Chuck Norris' bad side by failing to pull his punches in the filming of ""Lone Wolf McQuade""; that and his history as Kwai Chang Caine would seem to warrant a more pronounced presence in the final confrontation.  But four hours of plot development (again with a reference to the length of the movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?  That may be well and good for Sergio Leone pictures where the pull of a trigger takes but a second and ends a life equally as efficiently, but a good martial arts movie demands MORE and SUSTAINED ACTION (see ""Enter The Dragon"", ""Return Of The Dragon"" ""Project A"", and basically any Bruce Lee and/or Jackie Chan movie ever made for reference).  The Bride's fight with Copperhead and GoGo from ""Volume 1"" was far more exhilerating and much more worthy of a climactic ending than the inevitable showdown between Bill and The Bride (whose name, finally revealed, is one of the coolest things about this movie).

Logically speaking, anyone who likes ""Volume 1"" should want to see ""Volume 2"".  However, while I can recommend buying ""Volume 1"", I can't in good faith say that my money was well-spent when I bought the concluding DVD.  I believe, knowing what I know now, I would have felt better with the story ending unresolved.",1096070400,11,3059,4.811068702290076
1417749,5,B00005AQ65,"In a telling moment of ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" Bill's brother, Budd, played in a wonderful understated performance by Michael Madsen, is listening to a recounting of events we saw in Volume 1 - specifically when Uma Thuman's Bride single-handedly destroy Lucy Liu's O-Ren Shii and her bodyguard platoon, the ""Crazy 88"".

Budd asks ""You're telling me she cut through eighty-eight bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?""

Brother Bill replies ""Nah, there weren't really eighty-eight of them. They just called themselves ""The Crazy 88.""

Budd asks ""How come?""

Bill answers ""I don't know. I guess they thought it sounded cool.""

There is a LOT in Quentin Tarantino movies that happens because it looks or sounds cool.  I'm reminded in ""Pulp Fiction"" of the dialogue-less scene in the Pawn shop where Bruce Willis is upstairs selecting a weapon to use on the psychotic murdering rapists downstairs.  He considers a few lethal clubs and even a chain-saw before settling on the Samurai sword and in the audience I was thinking ""YEAH! Get the samurai sword! That'll get 'em!"" Plus - it's cool.

There is a scene where one of the characters sicks a deadly Black Mamba on another character, then whips out a notebook with pages of hand-written notes about how god-awful deadly the Black Mamba is. The character sits down, flips open the notebook, and delivers an almost pharmacologic description of the lethal venom, along with ""'In the bush,' the saying goes, 'a lion can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and the black mamba can kill you. However, only with the mamba is death certain.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'"" Pretty cool, huh?""

Tarantino's movies are cool, and the characters in them know it. The smallest touches are added, sometimes for no apparent reason other than to add a ""cool"" factor.  All of the members of Bill's Assassination team are called the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" and they all have ""Snake"" Code-names.  Why?  'Cuz it's cool, of course.

In the beginning, at the wedding rehearsal of the bride, we get to see Samuel Jackson portraying the piano player for the wedding, and is there anyone cooler than Mr. Jackson in the movies?  He asserts his coolness by telling how he sat in with practically every R&B group that came through his little town over 2 decades.

The Bride is standing at the alter of her wedding rehearsal when she hears a flute playing a familiar refrain.  She follows the notes outside where she finds her old boss and lover, Bill, playing the familiar notes on his old flute.  Bill is played by David Carradine, and if movies gave out ""comeback of the year"" awards like sports does, Mr. Carradine would have earned it in this role, courtesy of Mr. Tarantino.  For extra ""coolness"", the flute that Bill is playing for the Bride is the same one that Carradine played back 30 years ago in his iconic role as Caine in the wildly popular tv series ""Kung Fu"".

The ""Wedding Chapel Massacre"" that we're told about in a roundabout way in Volume 1 is set up perfectly in Volume 2, then executed with a single swooping crane shot that backs from the wedding party at the altar, all the way back through the church, down the steps, straight back through the gravel parking lot where the other members of the Assassination Squad are approaching with cool strides and lethal weapons.  The crane swoops the camera up overhead and we see the flashes in the church and hear the shots and screams - and we KNOW what is happening in there without being shown in gory detail.  I can think of no single camera shot as virtuoso since Orson Welles' virtuoso opening to ""Touch of Evil"".

I haven't told you ANYTHING about the plot, but if you watched Volume 1 you KNOW where the plot is going.  There's a surprise or two, but there's delight in every scene.  I've read Roger Ebert say that movies aren't as important in ""what they're about"" as in ""how they're about it"".

Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool.",1095984000,29,3986,4.717171717171717

People are so in awe of Tarantino as a movie maker, the producers or whoever was in charge of this nonsense were afraid to use a talented EDITOR. This movie could have been boiled down to 45 minutes, because most of the movie is nonsense dialogue that isn't interesting, scenes that are unnecessary (Mexican guy, anyone?

My mom hated the movie. My wife hated the movie, and poured her anger at me for making her sit through it. She wanted to stop the movie about 3/4 of the way through, but stupid me - I had to finish it to see if there was one redeeming quality. I was so wrong.

Sure, he is known for his collection of Seventies' B-movies, and literally throws in as many references as he can in this one. But if Kill Bill Vol. 1 was at least an often funny, irreverent and well-choreographed tribute to the trash films of the 1970s, Vol. 2 is his love note to star Uma Thurman. He manages to capture every angle possible of the wraith-like Thurman and loses no self-created opportunity to get close-up shots of her face, mud-spattered and all.

  This film has the look and feel of being a slapped-together mish-mash of outtakes from Vol. 1, with ridiculous B-movie dialogue tacked on, and a story appearing to have been created as a means of tying up loose ends at the last minute.

 Awful, simply awful. And this was the same guy who gave us Reservoir Dogs...",1095552000,10,875,4.768211920529802
1417755,4,B00005AQ65,"In ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"", the second part of Tarantino's genre-bending epic, the director invokes the Spaghetti Western. Where ""Volume 1"" was heavily steeped in Asian Martial Arts cinema, this one is more Western, both in the sense of the Wild West and  Occidental culture. Never fear, there is plenty of action. But, as Tarantino said, ""Volume 1"" is the questions, ""Volume 2"" is the answers. Not surprisingly, the answers don't turn out to be as interesting as the questions. But this is an entertaining film, and it makes good on ""Volume 1""'s promise. ""Volume 1"" gave us Chapters 1-5. ""Volume 2"" is chapters 6-10, in which we learn more about the wedding massacre that started the rampage and see The Bride (Uma Thurman) confront her former colleagues Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and, finally, Bill (David Carradine).

The cast manages to come across naturally, in even the most campy scenes. David Carradine makes a charming and charismatic cold-blooded killer. Watch for Michael Parks in an impressive dual role as Mexican pimp Esteban Vihaio and, in ""Volume 1"", police officer Earl McGraw. His comic timing is impeccable. Chia Hui Liu (aka Gordon Liu) is another bit of interesting casting, as High Priest Pai Mei. Pai Mei is a character borrowed from Chinese Martial Arts cinema, whom Chia Hui Liu battled in several of those films. ""Volume 2"" didn't generate the adrenaline rush the ""Volume 1"" did for me. But I continue to be impressed by Tarantino's -who claims that he doesn't ""do noir""'- ability to reinvent neo-noir with each new film he makes. Whether he likes it or not, Tarantino will go down in cinematic history as one of the great ""noir"" auteurs.

It certainly has fighting and killing, just not as much.

Tarantino went for real character development and he does an outstanding job. When I saw the first Kill Bill I was a bit disappointed in all the outragious killing. When a friend suggested I see the second, I was glad I did. It not only impressed me with the overall story, but with the characters as well. To fully appreciate both movies you must see Kill Bill 2.

1417762,5,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino's many, varied, and devoted fans had to get used to a slightly new Tarantino film in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1.""  While Tarantino has always had a love for action sequences, most of his films were heavier on the dialogue than the fisticuffs.  Not so in ""Vol. 1,"" which skewed much more towards the action side of the scale.  Sure, the trademark quips and pop-culture references were there, but the movie was defined by its over-the-top violence.

""KB Vol. 2"" represents a return to form for Tarantino (yes, it's an extension of the same film, but since had to pay two ticket prices, they are two films), with the dialogue once again returning to the forefront.  From the opening narrative, essentially working as the Chorus reintroducing the audience to the film after a long intermission, to several great scenes with the lethal Bill (David Carradine, in a performance that makes us wonder why we haven't seen much, much more of this guy), this film is a refreshing return to Tarantino's incredible pseudo-70's jargon and speechifying.

Tarantino's fans are also always checking his films for references to other flicks.  Overt references include ""The Searchers"" in addition to homages to Tarantino's other movies, and they do not disappoint.  While Volume 1 was entertaining, I suspect that Volume 2 will receive more replays, if only because the tale is a bit more complex.

The film does not have the audacious Japanese anime sequence used with such great effectiveness in Volume 1, but Tarantino includes an even more daring shot from inside a coffin as the occupant is buried alive (look for the exhumed corpse to play a little shadow-puppet game during the gravedigging scene).

While Tarantino has said that he is interested in the idea of bringing back Vernita Green's daughter (from Volume 1) for a future revenge drama, I think the better chance for a spin-off character is the character who finishes the film without eyeballs.  The ""Blind Swordsman"" is one of the most beloved Japanese action heroes, and this character would be a perfect vehicle for Tarantino to give us his take on that legend.

Top-notch performances abound in this film . . . Uma Thurman remains at the top of her game, the remaining survivors of DiVAS are pitch-perfect, and (again), David Carradine just plain steals the picture as an articulate, seductive, incredibly mean s.o.b.

A must for fans of QT's previous efforts.  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, but you should buy this one for the film, not the bonus stuff.",1095033600,4,2514,4.898584905660377
1417763,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin fans all around praised Vol. 1 religously... but Vol. 2 gets the cold shoulder. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, they hated the dialogue. Many people wanted the action and cartoony violence of the first installment. Some heard Vol. 2 was supposed to be bloodier (which I did read in a special issue of Maxim Goes to the Movies), but... we get dialogue. But in return, we get a much more developed story. Volume 1 rushed through the character development and storyline, and now Volume 2 makes up for that, delivering the classic Tarantino formula: The witty and intelligent dialogue.

So... Tarantino is best known for his dialogue. So why are fans loathing this movie? Doesn't Tarantino do what he's best at? Doesn't he deliver the same formula he's given to us since his first movie ""Reservoir Dogs""? And I read that some of the negative reviews were posted by ""big fans of Quentin."" So let me get something straight here. Those ""fans"" hate this movie because of the excessive dialogue, but, considering that they are indeed fans of Tarantino's movies, then they must really love the underrated Tarantino classic ""Jackie Brown."" That movie, my friend, is nearly devoid of any action sequences. Rarely any shoot-em up scenes (the big money exchange sequence may be counted as an action scene as well). That movie has nothing but dialogue... so why bash this movie that has relatively more action scenes than ""Jackie Brown""? If you don't appreciate Vol. 2, then can you honestly say you're a big Tarantino fan?

Well... that being said, Vol. 2 is another great addition for the Tarantino addict. Adds more background to the characters and storyline that was mostly left out in the first film. I won't say what the movie is about since mostly everybody else here already has. You just have to watch it for yourself.

Both movies are works of art. Neither is better than the other. After all, it's just ONE movie.

Lastly, I read that while Vol. 1 was an homage to martial arts movies, Vol. 2 was an homage to ""Spagetti-Westerns.""

I finally saw 'Kill Bill, Volume 2,' and I am so glad that I did. This second one definitely answered all of those loose ends from the first film, while it also deals with the humanity of The Bride. If you thought that she was cruel and heartless in the first film, your opinion may change after seeing this one.

'Kill Bill, Volume 2' got a lot of comments on the fight scene between The Bride and Elle Driver. Although it was good, I found the fighting in the first film much more provocative. However, I must say I was glad that this film wasn't as gorey as the first one, which was good, but very bloody.

The cinematography must also be given props again, for creative shots, as well as a great mixture of color and black and white. It wasn't conisistent, though, with the first film, in also adding anime. The first film also deals much more with Japanese culture, especially seen through the language. This film features a little bit of Cantonese, but definitely nothing comparable to the linguistics featured in 'Kill Bill, Volume 1.'

But overall, I must say that I enjoyed this installment more than the first, actually. I'm not really one for blood and guts, and although this one featured some, it definitely wasn't to the same magnitude of the first.

1417788,5,B00005AQ65,"Quinten Tarantino has done it again. He has brought back vision and direction to what has become a dead art form. In a world of blatantly ignorant teenage sex films and mindless violence, its very refreshing to see someone creating a truly beautiful film. His vision truly dances across the screen, and every inch of it oozes Tarantino.

  This movie is the conclusion of the two part Kill Bill storyline. wheras Kill Bill Vol. 1 was full of action and gore (lots of gore.) with rather little explanation of who the Bride is or why she is doing this, Vol. 2 has much more to do with the characters themselves. In Vol. 1 when you see a character onscreen, more than likely they will be dead in the next five minutes. This gives you no real time to understand the characters, or make real connections with them, which is a shame, as dynamic characters are one of the strongest qualities of Tarantino's films. where vol. 1 does little, Vol. 2 comes through in spades. In Vol. 2, you are finally introduced to the character Bill (David Charandine), who is one of the most interesting and complex characters in years. one of the early scenes in the movie chronicles the moments immediately before the Massacre at Two Pines, and is easily the most memorable scene in the film. It shows another side of Bill, apart from the cold blooded killer aspect. make no mistake, Bill is most definitely a murderer, but he is by no means heartless.  This character is played brilliantly by David Charandine, who deserves the highest of accolades for his performance.  another character that struck me was Bill's brother Budd, played by Michael Madsen (thats right, mr. Blonde himself). Budd is a lowlife, who fights dirty and is the least elegant of the characters. despite this, you cant help but love him. He really is a poet and a philosopher once you get past the grime.

  One of peoples complaints about this film is its climax. where the first movie had an amazingly choreographed showdown in a Japanese garden, this one has somewhat of an anticlimax. I don't think im ruining it for anyone by revealing that the Bride does indeed kill Bill, as if she didnt, it would be downright aggravating for the audience.  however, the fashion in which she kills him is not particularly vengeful or driven by hate. you can tell that she has conflicting emotions, that she both loves him for who he is and hates him for what he has done. some may be angry because its unconventional, but I don't think Tarantino could have done it in any other way. bravo.

  My complaints with this movie are few and far between. a few of the scenes seemed unrealistic, to say the least. now this wouldnt be a problem, if the rest of the movie wasn't so true to life. A few of the characters perform a few actions that are unbelieveable, and not in the good sense. its slightly distracting from the genius of the film, but nothing to fret about.

  This movie is nothing short of pure genius, plain and simple.

""that woman deserves her revenge... and we deserve to die.  but then again, so does she. so we'll just see then, won't we?""

1417789,4,B00005AQ65,"One thing renowned director Quentin Tarantino can do really well is pull off tongue-in-cheek humor while still maintaining a certain edge of 'coolness'. Once again, the film maker enforces his wild dreams while growing up, by churning out a solidly rich looking movie. There still lies that really nice transition of black and white scenes accompanied by even the cheesy camera angles that could be found in classic 'grind' style movies. In particular, during a scene where leading lady Uma Thurman receives some training from the kung fu master. The music also highlights the movie nicely, Rza of Wu Tang Clan fame steps up to the plate to mixing some smooth in-house beats, there is also a good dosage of Spanish-esque music to go along with the spaghetti western themes. On a purely aesthetic level, Kill Bill Vol. 2 doesn't overcome the standards set by the original then again, this sequal is instead focused on trying to give some proper development on a admittedly flat cast of characters.

With all the talk surrounding Mel Gibson's - ""Passion of the Christ"", I wondered why Kill Bill Vol. 1 was never the center of attention. After all--it was hands down one of the bloodiest movies made this side of a hollywood release. Well guess what, Tarantino decided to trade in all the gore for a more story-oriented approach. The movie starts off in El Paso at the wedding chapel where Uma Thurman as ""the bride"", was gunned down by her soon-to-be nemesis Bill played by David Carradine. It's time for revenge and the mission at hand needs to be completed, simple right when it is to kill Bill. Uma Thurman is eventually caught by one of Bill's henchmen, acted by Michael Madsen. ""The bride"" is tossed in a coffin after her prized sword was taken, eventually with flashback reiterating some strenghth in her mind, ""the bride"" crawls out of the coffin to pay back Madsen. Eventaully we learn of her identity, it turns out to be Beatrix, soon the villianous one-eyed Daryl Hannah comes around center field. The two square off in the movie's only true fight scene. What a grand one it is, and I was kinda amused at how everyone got so involved and even squeeled a bit after the gross conclusion to the battle of Thurman and Hannah. After that, Bea is off to South America where she meets up with a pimp who informs her of Bill's not-so coveted abode. I wasn't sure what to make of the static dialouge exchanged between Bea and Bill. See, in the past particularly a movie such as Resovoir Dogs, Tarantino played a way of comedic genius while still retaining a ""b"" movie feel of dialogue. The talking runs on a little dryer than what I expected and it turns out...Bea's child was never killed. In any case Bill didn't put up the fight I personally felt he should've have. In a twisted way, the movie played out nicely in the sequal instead focusing on the development of it's characters.

In a twisted way, the movie played out nicely in the sequal instead focusing on the development of it's characters. I was a little jagged in excitement because I thought there should've been a lot more action just as in the original, after all that's what set Vol. 1 so high on everyone's list and besides Tarantino is just a complete mastermind at mending good fight scenes. At the end of the day I didn't mind the thicker plot, at times the cheesy lines might weaken the story's power, but in the end Kill Bill Vol. 2 still manages to please. It's irresponsible, poses graffiti laid out on the nature of instantgratified adolescents all over and is a hell of a lot of fun to watch.

1417790,4,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 was slick, gory, and cinematographically fantastic, with character development and plot partially being sacrificed for the violence and action. Vol. 1 was a fast-paced tribute to pop culture of both east and west - and for that reason, many people criticise vol. 2 because its basically the opposite. But you have to remember that its not so much a sequel as the second half of a film. Vol. 2 does not have the blood-spraying violence and in-your-face tenacity that gives the first film its bite, but it does have richer character development and also an emotional maturiy that was not as apparent in the first volume.

Vol. 2 should not disappoint, though - the coffin scene, the opening flashback in black/white, and especially the 'cruel tutelage of pai mei' (in my opinion the movie's best scene).

For those expecting vol. 1's ferocity with perhaps even more, you'll be disappointed, but it doesn't stop Kill Vill Vol. 2 from being one mad film.",1094688000,,979,4.8562874251497

Those who followed Kung-Fu into the 2nd season pilot would love the ending (includes me, obviously).

In Vol. 1 Uma Thurman is just plain AWESOME. A unique heroine with a mission. Here she appears weak. It is not just the lack of violence and gore like some reviewres say but, the film is so predictible, It takes a 180 degree turn in the story, cinematography, and even the characters appear weaker. It also tries to build up a climax (which everyone is awaiting) that never occurs. The final scene is so bleak I actually thought ""Ok, this was a cool joke.. now when are they going to show the real film""",1094601600,5,639,4.461538461538462

After a the day it came out, my friend said it stunk because it had hardly any violence.  I decided to check it out anyway, I thought maybe it had a story.  So when I checked it out just like my friend said it was low with voilnece, but the plot was the movie's saving grace.

Kill Bill vol 2 totaly fills all the voids that it's predicessor had.  You find out all the answers to the questions Kill Bill vol 1 left you with.

This movie still has it's moments of violence, but only few people die, compered to the 74 that died in Kill Bill vol. 1.

Altho I usally prefer violence over plot(Ex. John Woo movies), this movie also had a touchy side to it, which got me a little, but not much.

Those who loved Kill Bill vol 1, but are expecting all violence and gore, and no plot, will undeniably be dissapointed.  Those who want a sequal to cherrish as part of the saga will surley be appeased.  If it wasn't for my friend, libaly, I'd be dissapointed just like he did.

1417798,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino's second half of his epic is a true mark of a master filmmaker at his best. While the first film pays tribute to the highly stylize revenge films of the seventies, the last half pays tribute to the dark and complex films that made the seventies such a celebrated time in cinema.  The story progresses into a moody and complex film about violence, honor and human frailty that is a true treat to behold.  Any other filmmaker would have kept the pace of the first film by adding more violence but Tarantino gives a human aspect to the last half of his epic and makes his over the top characters more human and more complex in order to give the revenge aspect of the film a little more meaning. Uma Thurman once again is great as our heroine who still is after the man who wronged her and David Carradine is great as her nemesis Bill and he adds a funny, touching and yet menacing aspect to his character that makes his demise a real treat to wait for.  This is a real classic in Pulp cinema and Quentin Tarantino cements his mark in cinematic history with this fine epic that will be celebrate for years to come.",1094342400,2,1128,4.3619047619047615
1417799,3,B00005AQ65,"Why did so many people have a problem with this movie, you ask?  It's not brilliant, but it's not terrible, so what's the problem?  Perhaps it was because there was only one effective action scene, or the fact most of the time characters are just bantering to each other?  Maybe it was the inconsistent cheesy camera work or silly canned music?

No, people were upset because this was advertised as a ""violent"" movie, when it simply isn't.  True action fans prefer more brutal hard-edged masculine movies like Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch, Siegel's ""Dirty Harry,"" Hensleigh's ""The Punisher"" or Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver.""  In ""Kill Bill"" the violence is silly like a kid's movie.  There is also too much female melodrama.  If I want that I'll watch the Lifetime woman's channel, thank you.

Tarantino deserves credit for trying, but unfortunately this is just another one of those ""hype-movies"" that will fade into oblivion as soon as the studio's marketing juggernaut runs out of steam.",1094256000,,984,5.0246913580246915

I really loved the epilogue in the begining of the second movie, the acting was awsome and loved the cameo appearance of Sameul L. Jackson. Every sowrd lover, martial artist out there will love this movie. The story is excellent with excellent revealing of plot and battle scenes.",1094256000,3,618,5.009708737864078
1417801,5,B00005AQ65,"I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was one of the first in line to see the DVD of Kill Bill Vol 2.  I sure wasn't disappointed.  And I think that Quentin Tarantino is a genius, especially in the way the two films work together. Vol 1 was all action and not much story.  All the audience knew was that ""the bride"", played by Uma Thurman, who also was Tarantino's co-writer, was after revenge.  There was a lot of fighting and huge scenes where this lone woman battled hoards of assassins.  It was complete in and of itself.  And it seemed that the back-story didn't matter.

But the back-story DID matter.  And that is what Vol 2 is about.  The audience has already gotten to know the characters and is also prepared for some incredibly horrific fighting that goes way over the top in violence.  I expected more of the same.  But that was not to be.  Instead, I was treated to a slow unfolding of a story.  The fighting was equally vile and wild, of course.  And there is one fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah that is guaranteed to make you wince.  But there were indeed fewer casualties in Vol 1 and some very tender moments too.  The characters grew in complexity, especially Bill, played by an aging David Carradine.  In this role he's the embodiment of evil, and yet his appeal is understandable.  Uma Thurman must have had to train round-the-clock to learn all the martial arts moves that this film required.  But there are some scenes in the film in which she has to use all her acting talent and show some real emotion in some incredible situations.  Her performance shines.

If you're looking for a kind and gentle film, this is not the film for you.  But if you're looking for innovative filmmaking, unrelenting violence and complexity, you'll LOVE Kill Bill 2.  Highly recommended.",1094256000,,1798,4.5327102803738315
1417802,3,B00005AQ65,"It's probably a good thing that Volume One and Volume Two of KILL BILL were never combined: there appear to be two different audiences that appreciated each one and probably would've been less enthused about one film.

Volume One appeared to satisfy those who enjoyed fast-moving action and cartoonish bloodshed.

Volume Two played to those who favor character and emotional development.

I watched Volume Two even though I thought Volume One was thin and overrated.  And, no matter how good Two may be, it still has to take its story and characters from One.  Two makes a valiant effort, helped primarily by outstanding performances from Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carradine, but it ends up trying to develop a deeper film from essentially a kung-fu parody.  (The tinny dramatic chords from 70's chop-socky movies reminds you of that throughout Two).

Still, the lightest Tarantino fair is still more interesting than most movies out today.

After reading this week that Tarantino plans to combine the films and rerelease them, I just hope he doesn't make more of KILL BILL than there really is.",1094256000,2,1109,5.021857923497268
1417803,4,B00005AQ65,"Many people seem to prefer ""Kill Bill"" Volume 1 over this, the second part. I'm of two minds about this. First, as a fan of character and story over extreme violence, I personally found much more meat to chew on in Volume 2. Second, and more importantly, I think it's kind of silly to separate the two films, as neither one is complete without the other. Tarantino intended them as a single story, and I watched them as a single story, one right after the other. If at all possible, I recommend seeing them both in one sitting to fully appreciate them. It may not be ""high art"" or anything, but ""Kill Bill"" as a whole is representative of good entertainment and good storytelling.

Tarantino weaves quite a story in ""Kill Bill,"" adopting his usual technique of starting somewhere in the middle, then jumping the audience forward and back in time to fill in the gaps. It is both intricate and intriguing, and it stands out as a high-water mark in some ways for Tarantino, while maintaining much of what his diehard fans seem to love him for.

In terms of story, ""Kill Bill"" is Tarantino's best work since ""Reservoir Dogs"" (still my personal favorite in his brief but notable body of work). Tarantino keeps it moving at a brisk pace, rarely letting exposition slow down the action, but there is a lot of story here to tell. Each character gets their story told in turn, and the audience can quickly see how each individual character's story ties into the Bride's story, which is the main thrust of the film. Her tale of revenge against those who tried to kill her (and, obviously, failed) leads down a twisting path, drawing the audience deeper and deeper into the lives and motivations of everyone. The main theme of the film seemed to be summed up in the observation that the road to revenge leads through a thick forest, and it is often very easy to get distracted from the path.

Certainly, Volume 2 moves a bit more slowly then Volume 1 did. The first film is probably most memorable for a lengthy fight scene in which the Bride battles the ""Crazy 88,"" a Yakuza organization which, while it doesn't actually have 88 members, definitely has at least 50, and the Bride fights them all at once. Volume 2 has nothing like this. In this second part, there is a great deal of dialogue peppered with quick flashes of violence, but the dialogue is delivered with Tarantino's usual flair for natural speech and the violence is both more shocking and more meaningful as a result. Where the long fight scenes just started to wear thin in Volume 1, Volume 2 kept them fresh while also keeping the story moving briskly.

Perhaps the most memorable scene in Volume 2 came near the end of it, when Tarantino genuinely surprised me with a development I really didn't expect. To give it away here would be to ruin some of the fun for a virgin viewer, but suffice it to say that some expectations I had about several of the characters were flipped completely around in the space of a few seconds near the end. A nice touch, that, and one I hadn't seen Tarantino pull off before.

Quentin Tarantino seems to enjoy making genre movies but twisting the meaning of the genre, and he clearly has enough of an understanding for the genres he works in to manipulate them cleverly. His attention, in ""Kill Bill,"" to the samurai fighter movie is both homage and elevation of the genre. He pays it tribute by mirroring many of its techniques, and he makes it better by adding in some excellent dialogue and a well-crafted story.

Volume 2 begins with an unfortunate synopsis of the first movie, which seemed out of step with the rest of the movie as a whole and really seemed forced in (as I suspect it was). Once this is over, though, it picks up quickly from where Volume 1 left off.

Still, Tarantino fans should be (and, if you read other reviews, clearly are) well-pleased by what they find in ""Kill Bill."" His ear for dialogue, his skill with a complex story, and his somewhat extreme sensibilities are all in strong evidence here. What I think is really good about ""Kill Bill"" is that even those who haven't liked Tarantino in the past may find something of value in this movie. If you can get past the occasional (OK, frequent) fountain of blood jetting from a combatant's severed limb and let yourself get into the story, you're in for a pretty fun ride.

Two other quick comments before closing. Tarantino often inserts himself as an actor in his own movies. He's usually not bad, but I was glad to see that he wasn't in this one. It was the better for his staying behind the camera. And leading off the film by quoting the old Klingon proverb, ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" -- that was simply priceless. Say what you will about Tarantino, but he does know his audience well.",1094169600,3,4767,4.541327124563446
1417804,4,B00005AQ65,"Soo...Kill Bill 2. What can I say? I watched it after seeing Kill Bill 1 for the first time (which, by the way, left me breathless and in shock, and I hated Pulp Fiction), and it blew me away. Ok, so maybe not the endless get-out-of-the-freaking-coffin-already! scenes (although they were well shot, and included Pai Mei, I wish that they had been hurried along). But Budd and Elle (I loved Budd- wish he could have been a good guy...but man, he made for a good character, eh?) made up for it. Was it boring at times? Yes, absolutely. The second time I watched it, I stopped fast forwarding only to see Elle's eye land on the floor (and to hear her screaming and cursing...hah! Some people claim all that yelling to be extraneous, but I found it hilarious and a wierd comic touch on pain) and to see Uma turn around that corner in Bill's ranchero mansion and...Wow.

  Being a feminist, and having seen the marvelous touches of respect in Kill Bill 1 (""This is what you get for f***ing around with yakuza clans!...now go home to your mother!"" AHHHHAAA! Why is that striking and funny? I don't know, but I think that The Bride exerting her own force as a mother (albeit a thwarted mother) strikes a chord. A big one.), that turn around the corner made Kill Bill 2 one big Steel-Magnolia-sized chick flick for me, with a little dash of Divine Secrets thrown in. As one reviewer stated, killing Bill didn't really matter anymore; taking back what was hers (happiness) did. When you see Uma's face light up, that's when to break out the kleenex box. There was no finer moment than that for me.

  Speaking of, a lot of people complain about the long, fatuous ending which skimps on Bill and  splurges on BB (where in the hell did that name come from?), I have to say that, well, you interpreted it wrong. The movie has itself come to the conclusion (without you) that what is driving the Bride is not revenge, so much, but a longing for lost happiness and one big missed opportunity. Yes, her decision to marry was a little strange and more than a little desperate. However, it makes the coming full circle that much sweeter. The Bride is really determined to make this kid's life awesome and free (as much as anyone's can be)from danger. Selfish? Yes. Human instinct? Yes. I don't know, but it gives me warm feelings.

Shockers (besides the corner one) in this movie: Having seen Pulp Fiction, I believed with all my heart that Uma Thurman is one of the ugliest actresses I have ever seen (perhaps it was that awful black hair). O man,was I wrong. She lights up the screen, and her intelligent, quiet acting makes her look beautiful, enhancing her with a quirky, violent charisma. Hell, this movie made even Lucy Liu look good! (Chicago? Charlie's Angels? I don't think so, darling! Stick to where the hair works for you.) The traditional Japanese stuff , not to mention the short Farrah Fawcett hair, did her some good. Wow. Kill Bill 1 +2 not only made my day as a feminist, they did some good in the world by making ugly people look good! (ok, some I'm a touch shallow. Sue me, eh?) It could be a tagline. Kill Bill: Making ugly people attractive through the power of good lighting and great acting. Thank you, Quentin!",1094169600,3,3219,4.5283993115318415

The greatest part of breaking up the movie in two parts is that Tarentino could accomplish a considerable change in style, without creating a 'break' in the movie. The casting of Carradine in the part of Bill added that extra touch to the movie, especially in scenes such as the 'super hero' discussion. Michael Madsen's character also broke away from the slick-moving, kung-fu inspired characters of the other members of the deadly viper assassination squad.

Quentin once again proves that he is a master film maker and he is God in Hollywood. What he try's to do is show who these characters are. You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her.

Chris Rock's Quote: ""Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them."" That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.

I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo. The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created.",1093824000,5,1500,4.1833910034602075
1417821,3,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino's style and atmospherics are unmistakable and very sharp.  I think his language and timing is unique and his violence is powerful and chaotic and fun.  Although both KB1 and KB2 are horrifically bloody, they're so interesting and new to the senses that it becomes easy to shut down that side of one's brain and just welcome it all in like a kid playing a video game.

So the movie was a big success.  But by the last hour of this flick ... I was tired. What had started as a delicious buffet had become a hotdog-eating contest and I wanted Uma to kill Bill and finish it already.

Bill himself certainly didn't light up the screen.  He was given a long buildup and a great platform to say something deep and interesting and instead Bill (really Quentin, speaking through his character) came across as a self-absorbed hack, talking a lot of philosophic-gibberish.  His main point: 'Nobody leaves Bill - You's MY woman, dammit!'.. The journey sure was better than the destination.

This cinematic style has now been exhausted and I think Tarantino has to grow in a new direction.  KB1 and 2 were a terrific joyride, and they are unique if perhaps not truly Great.

There are not as many fight scenes and the movie is not as gory as the first one but there is still some gore and violence making this movie inappropriate for family viewing.  The Bride character is developed alot more and we see alot more of what she was all about before the wedding.

I will agree with some that this is not the greatest movie ever done but I enjoyed it anyway.  I feel like there is closure to the first movie and I am satisfied with the answers Quentin Tarantino gave to my questions.  I now know why Bill shot the Bride, what she was doing in that Texas chapel.  I also know what happens to most of the characters from the first movie. Like I said closure on the story.

I only gave this 4 stars because as I said, it was not the greatest movie and the history of the Bride character could have been explored alot further.  I guess Tarantino only had so much time to do this though.",1093737600,,1137,4.178899082568807

1417825,5,B00005AQ65,"The continuation of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with a quick recap that clarifies the Bride's (Uma Thurman) vengeful journey.  The Bride was mercilessly executed by her former boss Bill (David Carradine) and his associates at her wedding rehearsal as she tried to escape her violent past as a hired killer.  However, she survived and is now seeking those who drew the first blood.  This leads the story into several flashbacks where the Bride recollects her past which explains all parties reasons for violence.  These flashbacks fragments the storyline, yet each memory fills a void in the story as the characters are illustriously described on the silver screen.

Tarantino maintains the visually brilliant experience that he initiated in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 where he uses cinematic nostalgia from different film genres.  The camerawork is flawless as it enhances the moment of each scene in an artistic as well as suitable manner.  In addition, Tarantino digs deeper into human values and morals as they conflict with character's backgrounds and traditions as the Bride seeks her vengeance.  The only thing that Tarantino does not improve is his score selection as it was superior in Kill Bill: Vol. 1.  Nonetheless, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 offers a violently alluring cinematic experience that has deep intrigues and much to ponder for a wide range of viewers.",1093737600,2,1353,5.085972850678733

Not only is Vol. 2 the best of the KILL BILL series, but it is one of the best movies that has came out recently.  It is all the better because it takes a turn from the already great Japanese story line from vol. 1, and goes out to the old West.  This setting is where Tarantino plays off old Western films like THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, as well as some of the best horror films ever to grace the screen, such as Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD, also Lucio Fulci's THE GATES OF HELL.  Not going to tell the ending, but it is more than satisfactory.  With some of the best acting in any of Quentin's films surely adds up to one of his best films.  Definetly check it out.",1093737600,,745,4.034013605442177
1417837,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino is a taste that I have had some difficulty acquiring over the years. I greatly admire his ability to populate a film with twisted, quirky but strangely compelling characters and fill their mouths with the snappiest, most sardonic dialogue this side of Raymond Chandler. Still, his compulsive desire to portray graphic violence on the screen has sometimes left me overwhelmed and sickened, creative though the carnage may be. Tarantino's love of blood was readily apparent in Kill Bill: Volume 1, a gratuitously brutal homage to Eastern martial arts films that premiered last November. Uma Thurman starred as the Bride, a retired assassin who seeks vengeance when her former colleagues, led by her mentor Bill, murder the assembled guests at her wedding rehearsal and leave her for dead. Thurman did an admirable job of capturing the determination and unbridled rage of an individual obsessed with destroying those who have wronged her, but Tarantino seemed more interested in placing his leading characters into frenetic, over-the top ninja battles than developing their personalities and motivations. Nevertheless, he has redeemed himself with the surprisingly stunning Kill Bill: Volume 2, a film that is as entertaining and moving as any second chapter ever placed on celluloid.

Tarantino has corrected the lack of character analysis that pervaded the first film by fashioning several powerful flashback sequences that finally reveal the histories, priorities and values of many of the characters. In the first portion of the movie we are taken back to the moments before the wedding massacre, when Bill (a brilliant David Carradine) comes to pay a final visit to the woman who abandoned him. There is a sense of wistfulness and nostalgia that pervades the air (captured beautifully by Tarantino's black and white cinematography) as Carradine and the Thurman reminisce about old times and discuss current anxieties. It suddenly becomes apparent that the murders to ensure are not crimes of hatred, but symbols of the heartbreak felt by a sociopath who has lost the only woman he ever cared for. Kill Bill has developed into a unique and touching love story, and the passion Bill and the Bride still feel toward each other adds complexity and shading to their continuing battles.

In later scenes, we see more enthralling flashbacks of Bill teaching his young protg about how the power of vengeance compelled a high priest to kill an entire order of monks and the Bride pushing herself to the limit as she perfects her martial arts abilities under the imperious instruction of Pei Mei (a great performance from Gordon Lui). These sequences finally give the audience a clear idea of the ideals and memories that compel Thurman to kill, and her mission now has an air of nobility and grandeur. It becomes a pleasure to watch the Bride overcome the tawdry traps and dirty tricks of opponents like the gleefully evil Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and the quietly sadistic Budd (Michael Masden) because it is clear that she has achieved a level of mental and physical maturity that they can't even aspire to. The battle sequence between the Bride and Elle stands out in particular as a wonderfully staged and scripted struggle between two women who represent everything the other loathes.

The movie climaxes with a brilliant thirty minute confrontation between Bill and the Bride that surpassed the highest expectations of the audience. A description of these final scenes could not do them justice; suffice it to say they include the most perceptive and poignant dialogue Tarantino has written since Pulp Fiction, riveting and nuanced work from Carradine and Thurman, and a dramatically and emotionally satisfying conclusion to the saga.",1093651200,3,3752,5.177924217462932
1417838,1,B00005AQ65,"What a waste of my time (and money)!

I LOVED Volume I and couldn't wait to see Volume II.

What a HUGE disappointment!

I'm a HUGE Tarantino fan, Uma fan, Madsen fan, Woods fan, and this just SUCKED.

If Kill Bill had been released as one movie, as originally written and produced, I would have walked out of the theatre.

All the excitment and choreography in Volume I built up the story line and energy, only to be let down like a thud of rocks in Volume II.

What a let down!",1093651200,4,479,4.1521739130434785
1417839,4,B00005AQ65,"I saw Kill Bill, Volume 2 in the theatres and on first watch, I considered it vastly superior to the first Kill Bill.  But after having picked up the DVD release the second it was released, and then tried to rewatch it all the way through, I realized it was a smoke screen:  Volume 2 is better than the first, but it's still deeply flawed and not even close to the lasting impact of Reservoir Dogs, or even Pulp Fiction.

There are moments of greatness:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is on fire, playing the gleeful, deliberate evil of the character to perfection as she gives what may be the greatest Tarantino monologue since Samuel L. Jackson's ""the weak and the shepherd"" speech in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino deserves marks for seeing the sleazy charm in Hannah.  David Carradine is perfection as Bill, stunningly charismatic, although without giving any spoilers, I should warn you that you won't get to see him fight very much.  You can tell Tarantino got a kick out of having Gordon Liu play the white-browed mystic Pai Mei, and Tarantino chose a great child actress for the crucial role of ""BB"", Perla Haney-Jardine, who becomes probably the youngest actor ever to nail that eccentric Tarantino tone.

The problems?  Episodic plotting, cheesy touches, overlong scenes and a howlingly dissatisfying climax.  Neither Kill Bill film had a satisfying narrative, concentrating on filmmaking virtuosity and great shots rather than cohesive storytelling, and while the greatest scenes still pop out at you, they don't add up to a journey you'd want to revisit over and over.  And in Kill Bill, Vol. 2, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff:  The Mexico sequence is excruciating, featuring a pimp character, Esteban Vihaio, whom nobody cares about, played by an actor, Michael Parks, whom Tarantino just loves for no reason.  (Parks also played the dropdead boring sheriff in the first Kill Bill.)

Perhaps he was embarrassed for the overload of gore in the first Kill Bill, because Tarantino piled on the sugar in the last act of this film and mired his own film in unnecessary, cheesy sentiment.  ""AKA Black Mamba, AKA Mommy""?  Give me a break!  Also, the relationship between The Bride and BB works just fine without the lovey-dovey last scene, which seems to serve no narrative function.  Or, maybe this last scene is doomed because the climactic showdown right before it is non-existent.  You don't set up a great character like Bill and have him go down in a whimper.  Tarantino has done this kind of ending before in Pulp Fiction, where the focus is on dialogue and acting rather than physical confrontation, but here, he's working within the confines and expectations of a martial-arts film.  No martial-arts film, even a Quentin Tarantino one, should leave the audience hanging by giving a dizzyingly unsatisfying 20-second climactic showdown.  If Tarantino had nixed that useless Esteban Vihaio sequence, he could have bought himself eight, 10 minutes to actually work out Bill and The Bride's final confrontation.

I've had this DVD for over two weeks now and put it into my player about a dozen times.  After the first time I tried to rewatch the whole thing (and nearly dozed off), I just started perusing only the best scenes, which at their best are just fantastic:  The Pai Mei training; the superbly funny Elle Driver monologue and the subsequent trailer fight; Bill's pre-climactic scenes with BB and The Bride; and the wonderful, trademark-Tarantino ""Lisa Wong's assassin"" confrontation scene.  Everything in between, unfortunately, was so dependent on not knowing what's about to happen that when you've seen it once, you will never want to see it again.

Is this DVD worth owning?  Yes, just for the delicious highlights -- just watching Daryl Hannah and David Carradine steal the scenes is enough.  But be prepared for an erratic ride that will lose steam as you take it a second or third time, and keep your finger on the chapter-skip button, because at the end of the day, Kill Bill Vol. 2 really is a mix between half a fantastic movie and half a cheesy, overlong dud.",1093651200,12,4116,4.856733524355301
1417840,1,B00005AQ65,"I am lost for words. It surely says something hugely depressing about us that so many people should be so hugely impressed by this repulsive and tedious celebration of violence. Violence, Tarantino is unmistakeably saying, is cool, really really cool. With only the shallow tribalist caveat that when you turn it against your own folk (friends, lovers whatever), it is out of order and those you have turned over should then carve you to pieces with particular viciousness. Then there's some thought floating around his mind that the vileness of all this is somehow redeemed by a strain of outrageously hamfisted sentimentality injected towards the end and focused on the heroine's daughter. I can sort of understand why an adolescent boy might find all this enjoyable (And did you see the bit where she cut that man's head off and all the bood spurted out? Yea! Brilliant!(Or was that Volume One - who cares?)) and one does get a strong and persistent sense that, to all intents and purposes, an adolescent boy has made it. But as for anyone over about 15... Well, speaking for myself, by the end of it all, I just wanted a shower.

None of which is to deny that Tarantino exhibits real cinematic and visual flair. But, hey, I'm sorry, but so does Leni Riefenstahl.",1093651200,8,1266,4.754545454545455

Now for the rest of the people out there who know what a good movie is supposed to be get Both Kill Bill's or at least Volume 2.

Volume Two of what I consider Quentin Terrantino's greatest work to date.  Now I will give the raving Terrantino fans a second to breath again.  Here are my reasons for saying this:
First is the visual styling.  I am a huge fan of the high road to revenge type of movie.  This movie Delivered it in Spades.  It has everything in it to appeal to the eyes beutiful deserts, old temples of martial arts training, and of course the nicest house I have ever seen any person live in.  Plus there is not as much violence as in the first one but just enough to satify.  All these along with the actions and movements of the charecters makes this the most visualy appealing movie I have ever seen.

Now on to the diologue.  I have not every really thought of Terrantino as a very good writter of diologue. I mean he does have some good lines in his movies but all in all the lines in his movies seemed sub-par to the visual style he uses.  However, I was floored by how interesting and original his diologue sounded to me.  In fact Terrantino surprised me with Bill's monologue comparing the Bride to Superman.

I Love this movie because it really showed what Terrantino is really capible of.  it has all the elements that make a movie a classic in any of my books.  Memorable Characters you can eempathise with, Great Diologue all the way through, and above all else that visual style that has always set a place in my movie loving heart for Terrantino.

Get this movie it is a choice you will not regret.  But if you do you did not heed my warning at the begining.",1093564800,2,1900,4.304225352112676
1417842,4,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, Vol. 2 completes the vengeful tale of the Bride (Uma Thurman).  Although there is plenty of violence in the second chapter, it is nowhere near the over-the-top blood spilling of the first film.  Instead, the film goes into the relationship of the Bride and Bill (David Carradine) and the Bride's past (we even learn her actual name).  One excellent scene is the training of the Bride with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) that contains some excellent Kung Fu action.  The best fight sequence is between the Bride",1093564800,2,531,4.866666666666666
1417843,2,B00005AQ65,"For a few shining scenes, specifically the ones with Michael Madsen, there was hope. To see Madsen, older now and hulking, sitting on the stoop of his trailer out in the middle of nowhere, I imagined I might be watching a real movie. But once Madsen exited the proceedings, the whole thing blew away like papier-mch leaves.

I'll be brief. This is an adolescent work by a child that has been given a lot of money, time, and expensive toys to play with. Tarantino seems to have learned his lessons well. Jackie Brown was a modest picture but a very good one, but it didn't quite produce the splash the director or the studios that hire him need like junkies slobbering for crack. Kill Bill will make a ton of money and get much more media attention, so everyone's happy.

The final scene is so hopelessly boring, wordy, and overdone I was actually squirming in my seat with embarrassment. The babbling ""Bill"" does about his theories on the mythology of Superman, and how they relate to the Thurman character, was the kind of crap you think is cool when you're sixteen and high as a kite. Tarantino's childish, romantic fascination with killers and assassins is a sad thing to behold. Someone really should tell him that real life assassins for hire are normally middle-aged ciphers with bad skin. The contempt the director has with average citizens, like Thurman's intended husband (the owner of a used record store in a small town) smacks of a heartless and pathetic self-loathing.

I watched this mess the night after I had watched another film, William Dieterle's The Devil and Daniel Webster. Suffice to say the differences between the two films, with regard to maturity and mastery of craft, are striking. Of course, The Devil and Daniel Webster was made in the forties, when directors weren't allowed to (...) in public. --Mykal Banta",1093392000,3,1839,4.776729559748428

Be sure to catch Robert Rodriguez, director of the El Mariachi Trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon A Time In Mexico), and his bend ""Chingon"" in the special features.  They contributed much of the soundtrack to Kill Bill.  There's a live two song set of the band performing songs combining ""Chingon-ized"" versions of traditional Mexican mariachi songs.

I'm glad I ate light before watching, because I surely would've tossed my cookies in a literal sense when watching a woman trapped underground in a coffin!  Yeah, it's that bad.

This movie sets the feminist movement (which I'm part of, and proud of it) backwards about 15-20 years.  Uma Thurman has been celebrated for becoming a walking skeleton.

1417862,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill stands as one of the most effectively ambitious examples of creative filmmaking this side of the 20th century. Tarantino's quirky genius--more comfortable in its own skin and increasingly matured--takes viewers on a daunting, dizzying, and deadly journey. The unapologetic revenge flick is the bastard protg of dozens of martial arts movies, spaghetti westerns, and cult films, spanning the twentieth century. Their influence can be felt from the opening credits to the final scenes, and is woven throughout the storyline. So much of what makes this a good movie has to do with the artistic touches Tarantino brings to the screen: utilizing the Japanese style of animation, or exploiting monochromatic filtering, are just two simple examples. Both films boast a rich production design which often explodes with visual interest. The editing, sound design, and directing all compliment a cast of devoted actors--most of whom spent months training full time for the demanding physical aspects of their roles. The film is certainly bloody at times, particularly in Volume 1, but the violence serves an important role in amplifying the mythology of Kill Bill. Audiences will be missing out if they can't see past that violence; the films' many merits certainly outweigh the not-so-occassional fountain sprays of blood. Not for the faint of heart, Kill Bill is an absolute must for those who consider themselves movie buffs, and it gets five stars here simply because of its unadulterated genius.",1093305600,,1500,5.30672268907563

give it a few more stars. Sorry, Mr. T)

With all the praise, I had to review KB2 twice. First time I thought I might have been
in a bad mood; nothing seemed right. So, seeing it again, I saw the same bin of cronyism,
deleted scenes stitched together, ambling dialogue that went nowhere and somnambulant non-acting.

I loved KB1, so this movie seemed a mush of outtakes was disappointing. I imagine the QT crew
deleting scenes then saying ""Hey, let's cut out the lame parts, then make them into a Vol. 2""
so's we can make a buck or so more. So they did.

QT certainly is a formidable talent; but in a terminal-adolescent yet
smart way way. Which is why his stream of movies run so hot and cold.

Likewise one could make an argument that ""Kill Bill-Volume 1"" was too much, with hardly any dialogue. So in reality, ""Vol. 2"" is really the balancing act. It provides a heart for the saga, without forgetting how to entertain. Whereas ""Vol. 1"" paid homage to Eastern influenced films through an anime scene, and through the brilliantly staged action sequences, ""Vol. 2"" pays homage to Western spaghettis through its black and white prologue, Texas ""funeral"", and of course Uma's fight with Daryl Hannah. The end scene with Bill, played brilliantly by David Carradine, is both sad and triumphant at the same time.

We see a whole lot more character development than there was time for in Kill Bill, Vol. 1.

This is a great movie.  It's not quite as comic book-y as the first movie (but there are still huge elements of comic book), and there is much less spurting blood.  Darryl Hannah's role is so good for her. How evil!

Madsen is just a great actor and what a great character (with depth, depth, depth) he gets to play this time.  ""That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die.""  What a great line.  His acting should shame other actors.

Elle eliminated Bud with a deadly snake before Beatrix even got a chance to kill him, and when she did show up to the party she didn't even kill Elle like I thought she would.

1417870,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino expands his ""Kill Bill"" film with this movie KB Pt. II. This film answers all those questions that crept into your psyche during part one.

While KB Pt. I was filled with unanswered questions, many fight scenes and brutal killings this film (Pt. II) is more on a psychological mission than a physical one. In a way this movie is the Western version of the East/West duo. The film still focuses upon the story of ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) and her revenge quest against those who wronged her. Most importantly in this film we finally get to meet Bill, played with interest by David Carradine. Together Thurman and Carradine take the audience on another uniquely original ride directed by Tarantino.

KB Part II has less brutality and sadly less Kung Fu. But in this film we are able to understand the characters better and the tortures they are faced with are more psychological in origin. We meet ""Bill,"" and the man ""The Bride"" intended to marry, Daryl Hannah has a significant part in the saga, Michael Madsen provides some interesting sensitivity, and finally the Kung Fu master Pai Mei (played by Chia Hui Liu) makes his debut training Thurman on to brilliance. This film is done with many black & white scenes and old western type scenes, while the music in the background sounds a little like an old spaghetti western from Italy I once saw.

This film is less intense than Part I but more grueling psychologically. One great fight scene is not to be missed between Thurman and Hannah of course! Tarantino manages to keep the viewers interested while creating a completely different movie from Part I, but watch them both and experience something unique and interesting, with stunning visuals and great music.",1092873600,,1731,4.821548821548822
1417871,5,B00005AQ65,"A minority of detractors have complained that KILL BILL-Vol 2 (and Vol. 1) is derivative.  However, this is Quentin Tarantino and there is a certain stamp and style to this film (and all his films). What is homage is also adding a large amount of originality to a genre.  Both volumes of KILL BILL is an amalgam of spaghetti westerns, kung fu movies,anime, and revenge flicks. The standout performance is, of course, Uma Thurman (as 'The Bride'). She is bent on revenge and wanting payback from those who ""ruined"" her wedding day and out to kill the man who engineered ""the hit"" on her: Bill (good to see David Carradine in a major movie role). This was a unique performance for Thurman showing off her acting and physical chops, and she should get a Best Actress nomination. Once again Tarantino shows his flair for crisp dialogue, drawn out scenes, and his love of pop culture, television and movies in general. When Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' gets in her 'revenge-and-kill' mode and the theme song from the tv series IRONSIDE (Raymond Burr) blares in the background, it's pure joy. It's ashame Tarantino doesn't do more movies.  However, as one film reviewer in praise of Tarantino's work states (to paraphrase), one has to remember that Tarantino is also a writer as well as a filmmaker.  He writes the films he directs. Therefore, it is a long process between film projects.  It might be a blessing because it makes his films worth waiting for. This reviewer is looking forward to Tarantino's next project.",1092873600,,1511,4.773946360153257
1417872,4,B00005AQ65,"You have to admire Tarantino for his unabashed willingness to take chances which, when they come off on screen, don't really seem like chances at all, just his natural cinematic prowess.

There are the usual Tarantino trappings that infuse all his movies; murder, money, characters following his own impudent way of speaking (you can almost hear Tarantino reciting the club owner's words), and Uma Thurman, who looks like hell and fights like it too.  There are also the Tarantino surprises, the completely unexpected moments that really grab you whether they are brash (plucking out Elle's eyeball) or subtle (being buried alive).

However, the movie is not as energetic or frenetic as the first, certainly not as bloody or violent (although gruesome things happen).  Is it a short-coming?

Yes: The first movie rampaged for two hours and dropped us all off in Anticipation-Land.  We visited hand-to-hand combat in someone's suburban house, a very bright-yellow truck, Japan's nightspots and ancient settings, and were treated to an introduction of Anime (where the movie really gets its inspiration).  Everything happens briskly, the action is almost, almost wall-to-wall, and the tone is basically, ""Here I Come.""

No: Kill Bill 2 slows things down.  It's almost as if Black Mamba has become more thoughtful about her revenge, and takes more time to contemplate its significance.  One such scene is her and Bill (when they weren't so hostile) in the desert talking about Pai-Mei, the Shaolin master who would instruct Thurman's character.  It's a quiet scene, moody, almost a whisper lost in the commotion surrounding it; and nowhere would it fit in Kill Bill 1.

Perhaps this is why the movies were split up, because Tarantino reached a certain point in Volume 1 and said, ""Now begins a different kind of movie, still named Kill Bill, but a shade quieter.""  Not to say that the movie is slow; but I did get bored in spots, whereas in Kill Bill 1 I was always at least partially riveted.

The ending is spectacularly done, even if it is longer than it needs to be.  All you need to know about the Black Mamba/Bill face-off is that neither one of them leaves their seat.

So now that these two movies are out, they will go down as one of Tarantino's best, and it is certainly his best since ""Pulp Fiction.""  To fans of anime and kung-fu movies it's the movie they've been waiting for.  To fans of Tarantino, you might be thrilled, or slightly miffed.  To other movie-makers, you'll be jealous.  Finally, to film snobs like myself, it'll make a nice weekender viewing.",1092873600,4,2569,4.8891454965357966
1417873,5,B00005AQ65,"Unlike the merely violent and often forced Vol 1., Vol 2. so effectively entwines a well-wrought story with thrilling action (including an absolutely terrifying scene of Uma buried alive) that it stands on its own as a great film. Where Tarantino's dialogue in Vol. 1 reached too hard for the director's trademark, gripping exchanges, every scene in Vol. 2 sizzles with all the talent and confidence expected from one of America's premier directors. Gone is the egotism and self-consciousness that overshadowed a potentially intriguing epic the first time around. Here Tarantino elicits stunning performances from all involved: Madsen, Hannah, Carradine and, of course, Uma. Especially worthy of Tarantino's reputation is Carradine's monologue towards the end about the connection between Superman and the average Joe. I think it is interesting to watch two distinct camps emerge from Tarantino's fan base: those who loved the animation and empty gore of Vol. 1 tend to dislike the more chatty and less graphic second installment. While I personally favor the latter, I understand the allures Vol 1. offers to some fans. To me, however, only the second volume holds a candle to ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction.""",1092873600,2,1213,5.290155440414508

Where vol. 1 is action-packed and over-the-top gory, vol. 2 is restrained, polite, and even a little touching. I was disappointed with the lack of action that vol. 1 so clearly delivered as well as with the revelation of the Bride's name; it added nothing to the story or her character, and I wanted to laugh at their choice of moniker.

Darryl Hannah and Uma Thurman and the Pai Wei-man, however, give amazing performances.

1417875,4,B00005AQ65,"This movie isn't perfect: a lot of the moments in the first third of the movie seem overly long and superfluous; padding needed to build part two into a feature length film.  Although Michael Madsen is excellent in this, he has too many scenes which slow down the pacing and don't build enough character to be important.  Also, the beginning wedding rehersal is far too drawn out and contains suprisingly bad acting from the supporting characters.  BUT--once we get past these slow scenes and unnecessary padding (not poorly done, just uninspired), we reach the golden road of an almost perfect film.  Beginning with Uma's underground burial and the introduction of Pai Mei, the film is utterly phenomonal.  Perfectly paced, expertly shot, and cinematically jaw-dropping.  The last two-thirds of this movie floored me with the level of expertise film making on display.  From the brutal training sequences with Pai Mei, to the shocking fight between the Bride and Elle and the PERFECT final half-hour of dialogue and emotion with the Bride, Bill, and B.B., any film lover will relish the opportunity to watch and rewatch this as a classic.  The final act at Bill's place feels so classic and surreal, it's just very hard to describe.  The wide variety of emotions, from anger and longing to love and regret, combined with fantastic Tarantino dialogue and some quick bursts of action, all come together to create an immortal moment in film history.  At the end of the movie, I was extremely impressed and moved, but I was also annoyed: annoyed at the first third that clogged up the pacing, and annoyed that these two films had to be separated.  If you took the best stuff of both films and combined them, we truly would have an all-time classic on our hands.  As it stands, we have an amazing film caught in the web of some unnecessary scenes.  Get through those, try not to let them bother you, and enjoy some awesome filmaking.",1092787200,2,1929,4.8090909090909095
1417876,5,B00005AQ65,"More Dialogue and less action-packed than Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2, nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion to this two-parter. Oh yeah, now this is fun movie watching. After the hilariously gorey Kill Bill 1, how on earth do you expect a sequel (which is actually just the 2nd part of the film) to top that? Why add some drama, create and atmosphere of intrigue and suspense, even some mystery, and a great eye gouging scene! I loved Kill Bill Vol. 1 I mean I felt like I was watching a live action Anime! My sister happens to be an anime freak (I only claim to liking the Drangonball series) and she agreed that it was like an anime. Maybe that's why it is so, shall we say, unique. It takes the classic revenge story and puts a new twist on it, and thus Tarontino keeps his audience guessing thorugh the whole thing. The second and final volume in Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL series is another stylish, sprawling masterwork. VOLUME 2 picks up where the first film left off, as The Bride resumes her quest to track down her former mentor, Bill and exact revenge. But before she gets to Bill, she must first take out the remaining minions who helped to slaughter her best friends and fianc. First up is Budd a quiet but dangerous country boy who lives in a trailer. Next is Elle Driver a one-eyed vixen who doesn't appear to have a heart--or a conscience. As The Bride makes her way closer to Bill, scenes from her past are revisited, including her training with the angry and brutal Pai Mei. Finally, The Bride locates her man, sparking a truly unforgettable confrontation. In contrast to the nearly dialogue-free first volume, VOLUME 2 is filled with extended conversations that bring the story full circle. Watch both Kill Bill's back to back and you'll have one entertaining evening awaiting you. Sometimes 5 stars just isn't enough.",1092787200,2,1877,4.656626506024097

David Carradine and his phony martial arts pedigree shows up in the middle and at the end of this endurance test of a film to talk......and talk and talk and talk. In fact, the entire film is a blab-fest.

I'm glad that I didn't pay serious movie $$ to go see Part 2; Kill Bill should have been one long, good film instead of 1 good film and one bad one.",1092787200,4,573,4.107142857142857
1417878,5,B00005AQ65,"Alright... It should be abundently clear that this is a fantastic movie...  I have yet to hear of anyone who ""didn't like it,"" and as far as movie experiences go, Kill Bill Vol 2 did not disappoint.

In fact, it had fantastic surprises, turns of events, and overall cinematography, and was just a delightful watch...  I liked it and David Carradine's performance as Bill so much that I went out and bought the complete first season of Kung Fu.

Kill Bill Vol 2 obviously follows the character played by Uma Thurman, ""the Bride"" further down the path to retribution for the murder of her family.  Bill is played in a marvelously sadistic yet serene manner by Carradine, and it's by far the best peice of work I've ever seen him do.  Michael Madson does not dissappoint, nor does Daryl Hannah, and Gordon Liu is scene stealing as the old priest, Pai Mei.

There is little that can disappoint with this movie as it has a great pace, Tarrentino's amazing sense of detail shows through in almost every scene, and the only complaint I have heard from anyone about the movie is that they didn't like that the body count was lower in Volume 2 than Volume 1.  Basically, Volume 1 is a classic revenge movie that explains the characters briefly, with more depth on the specific characters who star in it and a little cameo depth on the characters for Volume 2.  It asks all the questions and leaves you wondering what's going to happen for Volume 2.

Volume 2 answers the questions and also has some great plot twists and things to throw you off the track a bit, and delves deep into the relationships between Bill and The Bride (I'm not giving away her name for the sake of those who have only seen Vol 1...), and is just a marvelous peice of filmmaking...  It's very possibly the best martial arts movie ever made, and as Martial Arts Movies go, I liken Kill Bill Vols 1 and 2 as comparable to how The Godfather Vols 1 and 2 are to Mob movies.  There may be some other great mob movies out there, but nothing quite compares to the first two Godfather movies...  There may be some great martial arts flicks out there, but nothing will ever quite compare to Kill Bill Vols 1 and 2.",1092787200,4,2171,4.438287153652393
1417879,5,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino is famous for his unpredictability.

After the violence-heavy ""Reservoir Dogs"", came the plot-heavy ""Pulp Fiction"", then the character-driven (and, in my opinion, best-to-that-date movie) ""Jackie Brown"".

Why, then, has it been such a shock to so many people that ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has not followed the same template as the excellent original?

Picking up where we left off, The Bride is en-route to actually kill the titular Bill, and fills us in on the events up to that point. Gone is the yellow pleather, gone too are the Manga cutscenes, the Japanese hedonism, the bustling metropolitan cityscapes and the sense of mystery that the original movie had in spades.

But replacing those things are some truly seminal Tarantino moments, like his glorious homage to the characters of  spaghetti-western, a magnificently-concieved Chinese Master, a truly grim buried-alive sequence, and all the missing pieces to the puzzle of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"".

Performance-wise, Thurman as The Bride is back on top form, and is edgy and cool as the woman who is out to reclaim her life. Michael Madsen gives a star turn as prodigal assassin Budd, his laziness and viciousness contrasting beautifully. Daryl Hannah is a joy as the disengaged, violent Elle Driver (her demise is a scene that will go down in Tarantino history as legend) and David Carradine is perfect as the eponymous Bill.

Direction is Classic Tarantino. Whereas Volume 1 relied (some might say a little too heavily) on the ""Quirky"" factor, here most of the movie is shot in the desert, and Tarantino's artistry with a camera, as well as the talents of his perfect ensemble cast, are allowed to shine through, ggimmick-free. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride in Budd's trailer is amazing, as is the flashback sequence in rural China.

All in all, this truly is a Sequel that is an Equal, and in many ways, outstrips the original in terms of directorial mastery and wonderful performance.

Highly recommended.",1092787200,2,1981,5.015243902439025
1417880,5,B00005AQ65,I loved this movie...even more so than the first.  Put them both together [Vol. 1 and Vol. 2] and you have one of the most satisfying compilations of brilliance and talent you could ever ask for.  Tarintino is a genious.,1092700800,,220,4.475
1417881,3,B00005AQ65,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to go against the party line regarding KILL BILL VOL. 2: I simply wasn't as satisfied with this conclusion as I was with VOL. 1. If writer-director Quentin Tarantino has one fault as an otherwise truly tremendous filmmaker, it is that, in his immense enthusiasm for his art, he has a tendency to meander, or just to sprawl in general. He is so in love with a particular scene or group of scenes that he can't bear to cut it from the film even though it serves no obvious purpose to the film. The result is that the scenes slow the film's pace down (considerably, in the case of this movie). You had the silly scene in PULP FICTION (an otherwise awesome movie) in which Christopher Walken spent about five minutes speechifying about the history of a gold watch he hid up his ass during Vietnam, and now you have the long section involving Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) in this film. Sure, it's an interesting set of training scenes, with both Liu and Thurman pulling off some nice moves, and Liu makes the most of his juicy part---but did we really have to spend about ten whole minutes exploring this flashback just so we could understand how The Bride (Uma Thurman) could get out of a particularly sticky situation?

But if overlength wasn't bad enough with this film, Quentin Tarantino seems to have altogether abandoned his usual quick-witted, fresh way with dialogue and paced some of the dialogue-heavy scenes---especially the final scenes with Bill (David Carradine) and our heroine verbally facing off---in a such a debilitatingly portentous manner that it literally sucked all the life and wit out of the dialogue. Frankly, I got bored after a while listening to these people talk so SLOOOOOWLY and with so many pauses in between each sentence. What happened here, QT? If this is your attempt at creating ""atmosphere,"" then...well, perhaps you've been watching too many movies. (I suppose the overly portentous dialogue style was also present in VOL. 1, but the sheer energy level was too high to notice.)

That is not to discount the many good things about this movie. Tarantino is still much the flashy technical innovator in this film, and he uses almost everything from B&W to the old classic 4x3 frame in this movie. The action scenes are once again dizzyingly, dazzlingly executed, with a particularly memorable fight between The Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) that climaxes with a real doozy. And look, I don't have a problem with this movie trying to be different and more character-driven than the more physically brilliant VOL. 1. It certainly helps that Tarantino still maintains his good touch with actors; his characterizations allow Thurman especially to shine in this movie, and she comes through with a weight of emotion that is startling and occasionally moving. And, of course, David Carradine is a revelation in this movie---as was John Travolta and Robert Forster in PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, respectively---skillfully and charismatically playing a bad guy who turns out not to be as purely despicable as he seems.

It's too bad Tarantino had to be so heavy-handed with the dialogue scenes, so much so that he nearly drowns the actors' performances and muffles the considerable wit of his own dialogue. Some might find the dialogue passages of the movie ""hypnotic."" Unfortunately, I found the lot of them ""interminable"" the way they were directed and paced, and thus I must say that VOL. 2 is a fairly steep dropoff from the highs of VOL. 1. Overall I simply can't call KILL BILL VOL. 2 one of Quentin Tarantino's best films.",1092700800,,3584,4.833876221498372
1417882,3,B00005AQ65,"it was blinding. The Remo Williams, sword balancing, teacher was awful and the ending sucked. But put both movies together and you have a hell of an interesting afternoon.",1092700800,2,171,4.931034482758621
1417883,5,B00005AQ65,"The outcome of this movie is known to all before they see the movie. The bride will get her revenge and `Kill Bill'. As in many Alfred Hitchcock movies, the suspense is not in the outcome, but how we get there. And, in this movie, the itinerary is well worth the trip. Unfortunately, this means I have to be very circumspect in what I say to avoid giving away any of the key plot points.

I've never thought critically about any of Quentin Tarantino's earlier films, so I'm not sure whether this is true of all his movies or just this one, but I get the very strong impression that Tarantino's main directoral influences are Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, with a seasoning of Akira Kurasawa thrown in for good measure. There are long shots with no dialogue which strongly remind me of similar atmosphere shots in `Once Upon a Time in the West'. Also, like Peckinpah in `The Wild Bunch', there is a strong sense of inevitability in the fate of the band of outlaws lead by William Holden and Earnest Borgnine, and dialogue and scenes are taut with the tension of waiting to see how things will all play out.

I sensed the influence of Leone as I was watching the film, and this was confirmed in a big way when I saw that several pieces of music by Enno Morricone for `A Fistful of Dollars' was used in the sound track. This confirms my sense that Tarantino shares with Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allan a great talent for borrowing music from other contexts and using it to good advantage in his movies. I was strongly reminded of scenes from the very 1960's feature length documentary `Mondo Cane' in one scene of `Kill Bill', which was no surprise at all when I saw that a piece of music was borrowed from that 40 year old movie for the scene. I really wonder if Tarantino was just lucky with one audience member, or whether he was really being that subtle in evoking a movie obscure to about 80% of his audience.

It has been said in many reviews that the casting of David Carradine as Bill was a stroke of genius, bringing to mind his long run as a character in the TV series `Kung Fu'. I will add that Carradine does very well by the part even without that historical connection. All of the other actors execute their parts equally well, with a special kudo to Darryl Hannah for playing a really quirky scene where a large part of her monologue is read from hand-printed notes neatly written in a 3 by 5 inch spiral bound notebook. This piece of business is a small taste of the constantly different way of doing things that Tarantino pulls off better than I have ever seen it done. He does things which, if other directors try it, they take short cuts, and the business falls flat on its face. Tarantino takes no short cuts with important business. The scene between Hannah and Michael Madsen echos the overall course of the whole movie. You are certain that Hannah's character will double cross `Bud', Bill's brother played by Madsen, but you don't have a clue how she will do it. Her method, when revealed, suddenly seems incredibly obvious in the context of the movie.

Unlike the final episode of `The Lord of the Rings', which wraps up a story spanning three movies, `Kill Bill Volume 2' can be viewed with little or no loss if you did not see `Kill Bill Volume 1'; however, one of the things which makes it so much better a movie than Volume 1 is the fact that the central plot of the two movies is resolved, and resolved with much less over the top martial arts scenes than in the first part.

`Kill Bill Volume 2' is as good or better than any of his other movies, yet, it may not be as enjoyable to watch as `Pulp Fiction'. Key situations are equally as taut, but in spite of the `graphic novel' inspiration behind `Kill Bill', there is none of the `this is really all make believe' sense you have while watching `Pulp Fiction'. The title, after all, does give away the fact that this is storytelling. The grimness and `film noir' feeling in `Kill Bill' is accentuated by the odd red-green emphasis in the color print which I always associate with the filming of `The Matrix'. It adds to the brooding atmosphere of the movie, but I still don't like it. The recollection scenes in plain black and white are almost a relief to watch. It adds to the movie, but I could do without it.

Like `Reservoir Dogs' and `Pulp Fiction', the time line jumps around between the main plot line and flashbacks, but every flashback is very cleverly tied into the explanation of a key plot point. While the technique gives me headaches in the hands of some directors, Tarantino has honed it to a fine edge.

A must see movie if you like Tarantino or Peckinpah or Kurasawa or film noir. There is a lot less blood and violence than in Part I, so there may actually be less to put off squeamish viewers.",1092700800,2,4793,4.433598183881952
1417884,5,B00005AQ65,"A comment crucial to understanding this film is made by David Carradine in the 'making of' documentary included with this DVD: 'Tarantino's movies have never been about the violence or action; they are about the minds and hearts of violent people.'

In Volume 2, the focus on character and motivation is stronger than ever, and the Bride's final showdown with Bill - more conversation than combat - is as engaging a scene, emotionally, as the movie's other setpiece, her battle with Elle, is engaging viscerally.

But those who say that Volume Two is 'better' than Volume One because of its slower pace and exposition fail to appreciate the entire film. Volume Two is a counterpoint to - and a fulfilment of - ideas created in Voume One.

What may be the best evidence of Kill Bill's artistic value is that the Bride's five opponents do not just differ in their strength and combat gimmicks, allowing for more and more elaborate fight scenes; but in their motivations, their attitude toward violence, toward their own happiness and, ultimately, toward their own deaths. Each of them represents a philosophy. Vernita Green is the repentant killer; O-Ren is the megalomaniacal, Caligula-esque nihilist; Budd is a fatalistic, quiet nihilist; Elle is ambitious, cruel and spiteful. Bill is the ultimate philosophy of violence, violence for the sake of violence. The Bride was offered an escape from this world in the form of her child, which she lost, plunging her back into the cycle of death; but of course, as we know at the end of Volume One, her child is still alive.

My only complaint is with the DVD, which is fairly sparse on features. Am I the only one who sees a 'special two-disc deluxe edition' coming out in the next few years?",1092700800,,1737,4.818791946308725

1417887,4,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is the second half of a VERY long but VERY good movie by `cult' director Quentin Tarantino. Its distributor, fearing audiences would not sit through a movie over three hours long, decided that it be released in two parts. How this effected boxoffice I do not know. I do know that it is best viewed in its entirety. Movies running this long are rare but hardly without precedent. In 1939 MGM was faced with a similar problem with ""Gone With the Wind"", which clocked in at over 3 and  hours. Initially, the studio planned to release the movie in two parts. Ultimately, a decision was reached to release it in the long format, albeit with an intermission. This proved to be a brilliant plan, and the movie went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time.

In volume 2, The Bride [Uma Thurman] continues to exact her revenge. She continues to hunt down those who will lead her to ""Bill"", the man who mastermind the mass murder that occurred at her wedding.

Tarantino strikes me as a `child-like' director, a boy who is mesmerized by all things related to movies. I mean this in a positive way. He sees things in a way a `child' would see them. So, perhaps, did Orseon Welles, or Mozart, for that matter. Vision is not a thing defined by age.",1092528000,2,1266,4.448275862068965
1417888,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill Volume 2 picks up right after volume 1 ends, and so far the Black Mamba has 3 more people on her death list. After watching volume 1, I was amazed at the level of blood and overly exaggerated violence and I expected the same here. Forget that--volume 2 is very different from the first in that the focus is not on the blood and fighting, but on the story as it nears the great climax between the Bride and Bill. I was not disappointed in the difference but I was amazed as much with this volume because of how well it was put together. Questions arising from volume 1 are answered here as we see things such as what led to the massacre at the wedding chapel. Similarly, loose ends from the first volume are cleared up here. At the start, Uma is on her way to find Bill, and then in Tarantino fashion we get to see the events leading up to that point. Anyone who has seen V.1 must see this movie. For those who enjoy the violence the most you may be a little letdown from this movie. I can't imagine that though since it does so much to complete the story. Don't worry though, there is plenty of action and fighting so don't get the idea that Tarantino gets soft on this part. Overall I think most people will be more than satisfied with the second part of Kill Bill.

Video and sound quality are very good on this release, with the obvious negative being a lack of extras. What is here is okay, but supposedly there is a lot more that might turn up on a better edition in the future.

It's worth it just to see the expressions of doubt, fear, pain and triumph cross Uma Thurman's face.  The deleted scene is also worth th cost of the DVD, so there you go, it's the kind of extra I wasn't expecting with this apparent time-serving placeholder, so good for QT.  Mexican-American actors may protest QT's use of the Anglo (former) heart throb Michael Parks to play the Mexican capo, but Parks delivers a performance that outdoes his playing of a very different role in KILL BILL VOL 1.  I showed this DVD to three ftiends who had never seen part I, and none of them complained that they couldn't understand it.  It is number one, a simple story when stripped of its excrescences, and number two, hypnotic from the first majestic downbeat on the soundtrack.

The DVD looks and sounds great all the way through to the improbable and happy ending.  Of course, we have a feeling there will be trouble ahead when the little daughter of Vivica Fox grows up to brandish a weapon raised in vengeance.  Those of you who have read Cornell Woolrich's novels THE BRIDE WORE BLACK or THE BLACK ANGEL will have experienced this richness of story-telling before, but for the rest of us, KILL BILL is a novel idea, beautifully executed by a gang of pros.",1092528000,,1409,4.608

I had heard there was more talking in Vol. 2, so I thought we would finally get some vintage Tarantino filmmaking.  WRONG!  The dialogue--forgettable.  The fight scenes--horrible.  Especially the one where the Bride takes on Pei Mei.  The characters played by Darryl Hannah and Michael Madsen aren't nearly as compelling as that played by Lucy Liu.  She was a much more formidable adversary, and it was fun watching Uma Thurman take her on.  And finally at the end, when it is down to Bill and the Bride, you just want to scream, ""That's it?!?!"" when it is all over and Bill finally is dead.  In retrospect, the end was fitting I suppose, but I still felt cheated by the whole experience.  I knew that splitting it up into 2 movies was a ploy to make more money, but after seeing the whole thing, it is obvious why they wanted to do this.  The first one is lacking because it is not the complete story, but it was much better done than the second.  Thank goodness I didn't waste money to see this in the theater.

Even the most indulgent Italian westerns weren't paced as glacially as this mess.

1417904,5,B00005AQ65,"Of course,in the process of viewing this review you should know that the first film involved the elimination of two ex-partners of the lead, The Bride.  Obviously, this is a continuation of said film, and now to what I'll consider the review portion.

Uma Thurman plays a vengeful woman who seeks to destuction of those who betrayed her and attempted to murder her.  She lived, but many of those she knew and loved were killed, and after reviving from a coma she seeks revenge.  Having killed two of five on her list, she continues forth in a film that would appear almost completely different from the other volume.  More dialogue driven, the story becomes thickened with intriguing comments and unravelling of small details and comparisons that keep our minds attached, as we slowly develope the awareness of where things head.  Beyond this would ruin the story, so I'll put this briefly.  Through moments of wonder, action, and anticipation, Quentin Tarrintino never lets us go by keeping us glued to the story in ways it would appear only he could achieve.  A fabulous film, not to be seen before volume one of course, that almost supercedes its predecessor in an sheer fantastic story that never stops poking at the mere concept of entertainment.  Check it out, I can practically quarantee your satifaction.  Thanks for reading.",1092528000,2,1333,4.910714285714286
1417905,2,B00005AQ65,"I really liked the first part of this film.  I could have done without the scenes with Buck, the orderly, but you take the good with the bad.  The second part shows us why Harvey Weinstein is a rich man.  He realized that the second half of Kill Bill was pretty much a let down after the really dynamic and creative first half.  Part of the problem lies with manifesting Bill.  I liked the show Kung-fu, the show that made David Carridine well known.  That was when I was a kid.  If you watch that show now it is easy to see that Carridine was not in any way a skilled martial artist.  Unfortunately, for Quentin Tarintino, he still isn't and he is now an older man.  So here you have the first film creating the image of a real hard core, stone cold killer swordsman, and Carradine cannot pull it off.  Next, the music is completely forgetable. The characters of Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are vulgar and uninteresting.  Tarantino was forced to make the death of Bill as uninteresting as it was because Carradine couldn't carry out the O-Ren type of duel or the all out brawl of the house fight at the start of Kill Bill. I did like the Pro-life message that you had in the hotel room fight.  Watch Kill Bill, and skip vol. 2.  You will not be missing anything by doing this, and you will preserve David Carradine's finest work as the killer, Bill.  It may sound funny after this review, but Carradine was great in the first film.  He was creepy, and invincible.  Too bad they made the second part of this film.",1092441600,3,1517,4.345195729537367
1417906,3,B00005AQ65,"The most entertaining parts of this film are the various flashback scenes, one of which is an outtake available on this DVD.  While the flashbacks were all clever, I thought the main story moved too slowly, particularly the conclusion.  By the time I got to the big showdown scene, I figured that (a) the Bride would kill Bill, (b) Bill would kill the Bride, (c) they'd waste each other, or (d) they'd agree to coexist.  But 20 minutes into that scene, I'd almost completely lost interest in the outcome.  When Bill gets into the discussion of how Clark Kent is really Superman's secret identity and Superman is his real self, I was shaking my head and looking at the time.  I just wanted them to get on with it.  Didn't care what happened to the characters.

Vol 1 was an entertaining action film, and much of Vol 2 is good, but the conclusion really didn't do it for me.",1092441600,,872,4.446540880503145
1417907,1,B00005AQ65,"First let me say that I loved Kill Bill Vol. 1.  I saw it five times at the movies, own it on DVD and watch it alot!

Now, let me follow this up by saying I have no clue why people are raving so much about the second volume.

COMPARED TO VOLUME 1, IT'S NOT A GOOD MOVIE!

Volume 1 had action, violence, mystery, martial arts, and superb dialogue.  The Bride (Uma) fought her way through the first two members of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad (including a tour de force martial arts battle in the House of Blue Leaves).  This is all meant to build us to the conclusion when The Bride meets the final three (and supposedly most deadly members of her old squad) including the frightening mastermind known as BILL.

WRONG!

WRONG!

Nothing happens!  The Bride dispatches the last members way too quickly (so there goes our action), she fools around with Bill who turns out to be a normal joe (how exactly did he run a squad of hitmen or have ties to the Japanese underworld?), and there is tons of LAME dialogue spouted about Superman while making sandwiches.

Did I mention that Volume 2 has the most anti-climatic ending in the history of action movies?  If you've seen the previews you've seen the ENTIRE FIGHT!

Now I know Tarantino has a huge following, heck I'm one of them.  But if he set out to make a great action movie and homage to martial arts films he got it half right.

Kill Bill Volume 1 = A+

Kill Bill Volume 2 - D-",1092441600,9,1437,4.325842696629214
1417908,5,B00005AQ65,"I don't buy the conceit that ""Volume 1"" is Tarantino's eastern and ""Volume 2"" is his western despite a predominately western setting and the co-opting of Ennio Morricone scores from Sergio Leone's westerns.  That said, this is a great movie.  Tarantino is still exploring the eastern themes that he did in ""Volume 1"" yet he is also exploring more mature character relationships that he did in my personal favorite film of his, ""Jackie Brown"".

The likelihood is that Uma Thurman's multilayered performance(one moment she's a revenge-bent killer, the next a nurturing mother) will be overlooked at Oscar time because this film will probably be viewed in highbrow circles as a ""genre film"".  David Carradine also gives an excellent performance here.  You can almost sympathize with his rationalization for wanting Thurman's ""Beatrix"" dead for walking out on him.  After all, even killers can get a broken heart.  Not to be overlooked is Michael Madsen's performance as Budd, Bill's assassin brother turned drunken bouncer.  Madsen imbues this character with such pathos that we even like him despite him trying to bury Thurman alive.  The last chapter, where Thurman confronts Carradine seems to labor at times, however, Carradine's dissertation on the ""Superman"" myth may touch on the primary theme here.  We are who we are even if we try to escape into an alter-ego.  This may be Tarantino's way of saying that his films may be looked down on because they seem to glorify violence, even if their done stylishly.  However, Tarantino makes no apologies for making these films because they contain themes that interest him.  On a final note, the DVD contains a deleted scene that's pretty good.  I can see why it wasn't included in the theatrical cut because it doesn't seem to fit into the basic structure of the film but it should be checked out.",1092441600,5,1845,4.9869281045751634

1417920,5,B00005AQ65,"KILL BILL VOL 2

Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues the trail of revenge killings by Uma Thurman's character- The Bride- whose name is finally revealed. Both Vol. 1 and 2 were originally intended and filmed to be one movie. The benefits of this are similar to those in ""The Lord of Rings"" trilogy in that there is a real sense of continuity in the scenes and cinematography that might have been absent if this was filmed years later as a sequel.

Once again Tarantino pulls no punches. There are references and tips of the hat to the seveneties, martial arts movies and a dozen TV themes. This is a feast for moviegoers.

If you didn't see Vol. 1 you will be at a disadvantage although there is a small recap at the beginning. Vol. 2 does tone the violence down in favor of more dialogue, especially in the final scenes between John Carradine's character and The Bride.

Darryl Hannah plays California Mountain Snake to perfection as a diabolical homicidal one-eyed killer who turns on her own kind. Also great is Michael Madsen as the loner/loser Budd aka Sidewinder who almost comes across as a sympathetic everyday loser as he waits for his fate. Not to be missed is the chilling chapter 'The Lonely Grave of Paula Schultz' where Uma Thurman is buried alive and must reach back into past to survive.

Packed with pop culture references, martial arts violence and cinematic flourish Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great finish to one of the best film stories of the decade and quiet possible, of the last fifty years. Highly recommended.",1092355200,4,1522,4.622222222222222

I enjoyed this as much, if not more, than the first, which is a rare quality in any sequel. This homage to the old Kung Fu genre is a well acted, visually aesthetic film that cannot be missed if you liked the first one.",1092355200,,456,4.62962962962963
1417923,3,B00005AQ65,"There were too many times in this movie when I expected something to happen and nothing did.  It's not about the lack of action necessarilly (although there is that to consider as well), but about the scenes that didn't seem to have any purpose or bearing on the film.  The example of Bud getting yelled at by his boss at the local dive.  I kept expecting him to kill the guy or to come back and shoot the place up but nothing ever happens.  Seemed like a waste of film.  It would have been just as easy to show how poor off he was without dragging the scene out like this.  There were a few of these types of scenes thoughout.  There were also some really dumb parts that I didn't find very funny or entertaining, but they were so silly Tarrentino must have intended it to be so.  Bill shoots a truth serum into the ""Bride"" and its just hokey.  The wedding scene would have benefited from some editing to cut down the length of it.  The entire ending was built up and then you get let down when once again not much happens.  It's very short and lackluster.  They could have taken the time used to film the usless wedding scene and the boss-yelling-at-Bud scene and added a good ending to it all.  Honestly with a few minor changes the film would have been sooooo much better.  Not to sound like I hated it but it could have been better.  3 stars is prefectly on the mark I would say.  It DOES have some really awsome scenes in it, like the texas burial, the Brides training flash back (I laughed and laughed).  Rent it first and then purchase it if you like it.",1092355200,4,1562,4.240677966101695
1417924,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill Volume 2 has less action and less blood squirting but has a stronger story, drama and more dialogue than Volume 1. In Volume 2, Uma Thurman is still on her hunt for Bill (David Carradine). First though she needs to take out his brother Budd (Michaal  Madsen) and the one eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).

  It's slower with too much dialogue some might think but the dialogue is still always entertaining. Especially the lines delivered by David Carradine and Michael Madeson. Carradine does his best work I think and makes you wonder why he's not in more movies. He definetly gives one of the best supporting performances this year so far. Although Uma wasn't nominated for the first Vol she should be for this one as well. She does some of her best work here as well. The only problem I had is a small one. The fight with the Bride and Bill at the end is way too short and their dialogue lasts longer. Still surprisingly it's not anti-climatic and reminds me sort of the way a Westen show-down would end. Quentin Tarantino shows in this half that he wasn't out to just make kun-fu blood bath. This second half is where all the drama and stronger story can be found.",1092268800,6,1177,4.485981308411215
1417925,4,B00005AQ65,"Thursday, August 12, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Almost languid ending.

Compared to the frenetic carnage of the first installation, the second has an almost languid ending to the chop-socky revenge saga.  Uma returns as the bride and continues her quest to wreak revenge on those who apparently killed her and her unborn child.  As the scenes shift between southwest spaghetti western locales and her training in the east; I was reminded that I actually preferred the first installment's Tokyo rumble and the treatment.  Granted, a second dose of the same killing would be tough to handle, it was just ... different.  More introspective and dare I say it, calm in its damage.  Uma is more precise here and not as whirlwind, tearing through 88 gangsters.  Taken together, it's an impressive homage piece and artistic statement.",1092268800,2,815,4.905109489051095
1417926,5,B00005AQ65,"The first time I heard someone say 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' was better than 'Pulp Fiction,' I was immediately skeptical. I think perhaps this biased me against KB before my first viewing, and the film did little to change my mind. I enjoyed the first volume, but I felt as if something was missing... the something that made me love the characters in 'Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs.' I appreciated the goofy violence as comic relief, but not much more. I felt the fight scene with the Crazy 88s was cool, but entirely too long. In all, I missed Tarantino. The first movie smacked of his visual taste, but very little of the feeling typically behind it.

Vol. 2, however, is a different story. If you view it as a sequel, suffice it to say it's 10 times the film Vol. 1 was. If it is, as most (and undoubtedly Tarantino himself) feel, the second half of a single movie in two parts, then it validates the first half (and then some). We see more character development in the first twelve minutes than in the entire first volume, and more depth than Fiction. It's a revenge movie on the surface, of course, but at its heart is something different... something for which symptoms were completely absent from Vol. 1. At least on par with Dogs, if not better.

YOUR MONEY TIMES TWO! Since I respect Miramax due to hundreds of quaility films, I'll let them stiff me this once. Quentin Tarantino is an amazing filmmaker, I love all his films. The ones he wrote and directed anyway. Some of the screenplays he wrote in the past were directed by others than himself. Which they were mostly cool flicks, but they might have been better had he made them himself. The reason I say this film isn't for everyone is because I have a part time job in a video store and I hear some people say how they just don't get into it. They say they didn't like the first Kill Bill and they aren't interested in bothering with the 2nd. I did get a customer to get both films and have a double feature. He later said it was one of the best film experiences he'd ever had. At first he wasn't interested in the series. Truthfully these two films together are an amazing piece of work and it's ashame to over look them. I'm not saying get the kids rounded up and have family movie night with Kill Bill, that's obvious. I hope people know that this isn't for children. It is great entertainment for grown ups who like deep, dark and dramatic sword swinging action with plenty of Tarantio style humor.

1417932,4,B00005AQ65,"I have seen many different aspects on this great movie; the most distinctive difference comes from how to define Volume 2:

A. To consider Volume 2 as the second half of the whole story, or

B. To consider Volume 2 as the sequence story after Volume 1.

If the fans agree with A, they will give great credit for this movie; but from B, the movie will be rated badly.  I think it is unfair to compare the two parts, it is like to compare which is more important to you: your mom or your wife?  These two parts contains very different elements, without either part, the story is not complete.

In the Volume 1, Tarantino blends samurai sword combating, animation, Bruce Lee style dressing, black and white, montage, and some other effects satisfied, or spoiled movie goers.  These are never been showing in Hollywood movie, yet these are very common in Japanese and Hong Kong's kung fu movies.  I couldn't deny such combination is a great idea and it brings us something the western fans never seen before.  At the end of Volume 1, there are still too many questions to be answered.  Why Bill and gangs have to kill the Bride? Why Elle hate the Bride that way?  Why Bill still wants to kill the Bride even he knows she has his baby?  If these questions are not answered, Volume 1 is only the show off of fighting, no story at all.

Volume 2 means a lot to the whole story: it turns the ACTION movie into DRAMA.  With volume 2, the story is complete.  The whole Volume 2 is full of story, plot, and Tarantino style talking.  The action scenes are comparatively fewer than Volume, yet the fighting between Bride and Elle, and the story of Pai Mei, still enrich the action element of this movie.

The story ends with hugging her daughter in a motel watching TV, it is so close to our daily life.  I suddenly feel that I am so lucky, I can enjoy my family life without killing so hard.  This is an Odysseus ending: to go through extreme danger and great risk, the only wish is to return to family.  The movie also shows the greatness of the normal people like our kind.

This is a 5-star movie to me, and will be on top of my list for a long time.  The reason why I only rate 4 stars simply because the 2 volumes cost me twice to enjoy it, both in theatre and on DVD.  I can not send a protest letter to Miramax, so I give it 1 less star out of 5.",1092096000,15,2341,4.222972972972973

Well, while watching I kept thinking that the movie is about to nova into a fantastic fight scene like Vol 1 did so often.  The amazing scenes never did materialize and at the end I felt kinda shorted.  I started wondering if it had a smaller budget that the first.  Crazy idea for a fan, but business wise it would be a good guess that the movie would do great at the box office because of volume 1.  I went over to the imdb site (Movie Info site) to see if I could find the stats...well, my guess was correct.  Volume 1 had a 55 million dollar budget and volume 2's budget was only 30 million.  That is nearly half the first film.  Well, if some of you felt a little slighted and thought perhaps it was your expectation level, well, you are right! Chop the budget of any sequel in half and see if you still get the same results.  Too bad the tickets weren't half price or the DVD price was not chopped in half.  Oh well, I am sure that it will do great in the long run, because so many of us were already committed from volume 1.

That being said...as a 'second act,' Tarantino completely makes over the 'sequel' concept, even though this isn't supposed to be a sequal, but the second half of a long film.  Since that's how Mirimax marketed it, that's how I'm callin' it.  Be that as it may, I have never seen a 'second' film so thoroughly compliment it's predecessor, yet be able to stand on it's own.

This is, story-wise, infinitely better than kB1, which was essentially a live-action cartoon. (Still a phenominal work on it's own, but the two are strikingly different in terms of what they deliver to the Audience) The Bride continues her quest to Kill Bill, and along the way, character development is just in overdrive.  I would be saddened if Keith Carradine doesn't pull an Oscar Nom out of his chilling/loveable/diabolical Bill.  It is truly one of the best performances of the year, and definitely of his career.  Thurman and Hannah also turn in career-best performances.  Also Michael Madsen adds a depth of character to his assassin turned drunk that makes him freakishly empathetic.

This movie is abolutely gorgeous in it's cinematography as well.  Whereas KB1 was alive with color, this volumes more muted tones perfectly compliment the overwhelming multi-layers of the story and performances.  Never has a trailer in the desert looked so good!

It had a better ending and the story felt more complete. So go out and get the film when it comes out!",1091836800,8,729,3.879194630872483
1417942,2,B00005AQ65,"I have Volume 1 on DVD. I saw it twice in theaters and have watched it numerous times at home. If I reviewed that one, it would be five stars easily. I decided to review this one as a warning. Also, this one will contain spoilers.
The problems with Volume 2 start at the very beginning. Uma Thurman (the Bride) is seen at her wedding, in a long, drawn-out flashback. At the end of that scene, and a good twenty minutes later, what did we learn? Absolutely nothing. We already found out in Volume 1 that everyone in the chapel except her was killed. This was completely pointless. Even Samuel L. Jackson's role didn't save this seemingly endless scene. Ok, so then we're in present day. Uma is on her way back to the desert to kill the next on her list, Budd. After a not so brief tale of a day in his life, she finds his trailer and is about to bust in, when he blasts a round of rock salts at her from his shotgun. He buries her alive and then what happens? Another flashback, going even further back this time, to when she was trained as an assassin. This would have been cool if Gordon Liu (Pai Mei, the bride's trainer) wasn't so borderline cheesy. Yes, I know what to expect at a Tarantino flick. The humor is as pertinent as the violence, but Pai Mei was dumbass funny, not cool funny or even slapstick funny. It just got annoying after awhile. So, then she escapes from her grave and goes back to the trailer to find not one, but two people from her list. Elle Driver (remember Daryl Hannah in that sexy nurse uniform in Volume 1?) came to buy the Bride's (they say her real name, but it makes no difference because they could have said it in Volume 1. Another pointless thing.) Hattori Hanzo sword from. In the trailer, Budd opens the bag of money and inside is a Black Mamba snake. It bites him a few times and he dies. To that, I have to say, what the ****? Then, Uma busts in and a fight ensues. Might I add, an hour into the film and this is the first fight scene. This fight was decent, but it ends with the Bride goughing out Elle's other eye. Then she leaves the trailer without even killing her. Again, what the ****? Then, the movie goes downhill from there. And if you haven't seen it yet, I'm sorry for giving so much away, but I think you'll thank me if you were planning on dropping your $20 for this. If you don't want to know the ending, don't read on.
So, the Bride finally catches up with Bill. she walks in with her gun and is confronted by her daughter. Not too shocking, since we already know her daughter survived the massacre at the chapel. Now, her whole motivation changes. She goes from a vengeful force to a parent and starts to care for her, with Bill? Ok, last time, what the ****? The little girl goes to sleep and Bill and the Bride finally decide to have it out. But, instead of having a big fight scene with a lot of cool choreographed moves and pints of blood being spilled, they have a talk. After about 15 minutes of pointless banter, they finally draw swords. If you blink, you'll miss all the moves because that's how short it is before she does this heart exploding move thing. Basically how it works is Bill takes five steps and his heart fails and he drops dead. Yes, surprise, she kills Bill.
If there was no Volume 1, this might have been a better movie because it built up to this. I fully expected that as she got closer to her goal, the odds against her would be stacked that much higher, especially Bill. He didn't have one guard or suboordinate on his property. Also, what happened to that dangerous vigilante Uma played in Volume 1? In 2, she was actually torn as to whether she should kill him because she might still have feelings for him? Please! The saddest part about this is that it's supposed to be a continuation of the first one, not even a sequel. It felt like a totally different film. I was surprised by Tarantino this time around. I found it difficult to believe that I loved Volume 1 so much and I hated Volume 2 so much. If you still might be thinking that it can't be that bad, I'm telling you it is. 2 stars is actually a little generous. If you absolutely have to see it for yourself, rent it, but you are forewarned.",1091750400,,4191,4.259723964868256

Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future.  Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure.

Even if a movie of his totally sucked, it's still written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, so it has that going for it. The Kill Bill story of The Bride is, in my opinion, very entertaining to watch. The first film, Volume 1, was more of a movie for over-the-top violence and homage to early asian Kung Fu movies, but Volume 2 was much different. Stepping back from the violence somewhat substantially, Quentin has gone to more of a character study in this Volume. This film is about what will happen to The Bride, because there is a catch before she can kill Bill. I liked Volume 2 condiderally better than Volume 1, as I don't care too much for the bloody dismemberment and decapitations that littered the screen in the first film. However, I still gave Volume 1 a 5-star rating. Because you can't critique a film until you've seen both halves of it. Am I right?

If you liked Volume 1 for the action and violence, you may be disappointed in this film. More of a character study, the violence is still there, but to much less of a degree and extent. But it isn't needed at all in this film to make it great. 5 stars, Outstanding.

The acting in this movie surpassed the acting by Vivica fox and lucy lui in the first one a whole lot. Michael Madsen was particulary amazing as Budd.

1417949,4,B00005AQ65,"?Revenge is a dish best served cold.?

  When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the ?Hollywood elite? in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous ? In this situation, one shouldn?t question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.

  Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:

  A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc?, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.

  The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film?s lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.

  As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character?s eye was plucked out. Granted having one?s eye plucked out isn?t a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman?s role in the second installment can?t be complimented more then her role in the first ? She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a ?sweet?, vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman ? There isn?t much to say other then ?Bravo?!

  Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself ? actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system ? maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino?s near perfect masterpiece ? a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait.",1090454400,7,6473,4.754010695187166

Well first of all, this film collection was made to pay homage to old kung-fu films. Though I'm not a fan of kung-fu movies, I thought it was very creative to do so in the movie.
'Kill Bill, Volume 2' is a little bit different. The action has slowed down some, and the story has sped up. You find out a lot of details in this movie that tell you the backstory of the wedding where The Bride almost died, you see her being trained by a Japanese master, you see why the Black Mamba wears an eyepatch over her eye. And then you see the Bride kill Bill. I will not go into details on how she manages to do so. You know how they beeped out the Brides' name in the first one? Not in this one.

I give it two stars because there were some scenes that were kind of cool- To mention the kung fu master scenes and the 4th Assassin losing her left eye.

KB2 is definitely a different animal from KB1, as the martial arts action is not as predominant (except for a few key scenes), and there is more character development. A large chunk of the film concerns the back-story, or what happened prior to the beginning of KB1. Tarrantino flips back and forth in time, but this never slows the flow of the basic plotline. The episode featuring Michael Madsen is by far the most entertaining, and his comeuppance is quite grisly indeed. Dialogue is superb and oftentimes hilarious, with Gordon Liu getting off some really choice lines; in fact, he is one of the best things about this film. Don't be put off by some reviewers, who have stated that the film is boring, compared to KB1. This is like comparing apples and oranges (they both taste good).

When April 16, 2004 came, I went straight to the theatre and saw the 1st showing they had for it.  When it was over,  I thought I can't believe that I paid to see that trash.  I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 a lot and liked it every time, but now I can't look at Volume 1 the same because it had a such a stupid and senseless and boring conclusion in the 2nd volume.  If you loved Volume 1 and haven't seen it yet, don't say there wasn't a warning.  This movie will make you wonder how could Quentin Tarantino make such crap.  Oh yeah, if you are expecting an action-packed ultra-violent movie from this trash, look somewhere else because you won't get action or blood from this movie.  There is a whole lot of senseless conversations.  I'm sorry but DO NOT listen to the critics, they don't want to admit that Quentin Tarantino finally made a bad movie.  I know some of you have to finish this tale of revenge, then go see it if you are really anxious to see what happens to Uma Thurman's character.  I'm still really mad that they made the conclusion very bad and boring and stupid.
P.S. You might be wondering why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, well, fine, I'll admit some of the story points in this movie were fitting in and some of the movie was good, but not good enough.

While Vol. 2 has much less violence than the first movie, Tarantino treats the audience to character development which makes the final scene between Beatrix Kiddo and Bill all the more potent.

1417959,5,B00005AQ65,"Okay, first to the person who said that a great filmmaker would have told the movie in order, told the main character's name, not show the wedding scene, not use bad music etc., let me educate you:
A typical filmmaker would have told the movie in order.
A typical filmmaker would have told us the character's name right off the bat.
A typical filmmaker would have put in unoriginal, crappy pop music.
A typical filmmaker would try to be original and not put in the wedding scene to try to make you use your imagination.
Quentin Tarantino is obviously NOT your typical filmmaker and I find his movies to be fresh and original takes on common themes and plots. There are revenge flicks a-plenty, told the same way, with the same type of character, same reasons, etc. QT took that and molded it to his own vision with Uma Thurman (one of her top performances), Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and all in mind the whole time he wrote this movie. QT writes his screenplays around the music because that's already in mind as well. In fact, he would scrap a scene if he couldn't get the rights to the song he wants to go with the scene. You can tell too. Who else can make an Ennio Morricone spaghetti western song go along with a samurai movie scene? Using old music was part of the homage (especially using Morricone and Meiko Kaji (see Death Rides a Horse and Lady Snowblood)).
About the wedding scene, while I would have liked to see the DiVAS beat The Bride to the ground, QT pulled away at the exact moment to make you use your imagination, but still gives you an idea of what went on in there (using one of his trademark camera shots, by the way).
Telling the movie out of order works brilliantly and causes a mix of foreboding and hindsight. The chapter thing was a nice touch as well.
Not telling the character's name was a way to show the dimensions of the character. In the first Volume, The Bride is a nameless killing machine, without mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and conscience. In the second movie, she's a woman, a fighter, still a killer, a mother, a lover, with a name. She's more fleshed out, more three dimensional.
This movie was a refreshing break from the dull and unoriginal. I loved it and I appreciate it for what it is on its own and not compare it to anything else because it far surpasses anything else. As it is said in Volume Two, ""You don't compare a Hanzo sword to another sword except with another Hanzo sword."" You don't compare a Quentin Tarantino movie with another movie except another QT movie.",1089417600,4,2527,4.495652173913044

You don't have to sit threw this one then watch the first one to get it, its like its complete all on its own. Flashbacks to the past with Bill and Beatrix Kiddo fill the blanks. Pie Mei is a hoot as the white long bearded,small, old chinese guy. Subtitiles and foreign language get to be boring after awhile but once the action kicks in, in the final 2 chapters it's worth it all. The final climax with Elle and Budd is great, as Michael Madsen(in a role fit for him) gets venom from a snake in him. The plucking of the eyeball part and bitch-fight scene between Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman was a highlight. The final chapter is longer then the rest, being the final chapter. David Carradine plays Bill to the maximum. Folks, Tarantino loves to create story and long pieces of dialouge, he knows what he is doing. Loved Bill's speech about all the superheroes. Loved Thurman all dirty and sweaty. Loved everything about this movie. A movie too good for itself. Samuel L.Jackson has a small cameo in the wedding scene.

1417964,5,B00005AQ65,"They say that art mimics life, and vise versa. It's all about mirrors, and how we see ourselves in them. What one person sees might not be the exact same thing that another sees, but the general visual is still retained. Every detail altered to perfection, or skewed, pending on the eyes of the viewer. This can be said about the saga that is Kill Bill. Everyone who watches this film might not catch all the great references, and tributes, but rest assured, everyone will walk away more pleased than they have with a film in ages.
When we last left our intrepid heroine she was two notches into her ""Death List Five"" with three remaining, the last name on that list being the title name, Bill. We witnessed the Bride, codenamed Black Mamba (real name unknown, but discovered), take on an entire Japanese Yakuza clan, the best in all of Tokyo, and win. We felt her ""mercy"" towards another that had betrayed her, and the wicked life that remained. Oaths were broken, and lives were shattered. The gloves have now come off.
Those going into Volume 2 expecting more violence are going to be sadly misplaced. This is where the film really begins for the viewer. True, there are some great fight scenes, but every one of them are right to the point, no messing around this time. Is this a negative thing? Not at all. With those three names remaining on the List, we can expect some action true, but we now need the back story as to where we are now.
We are rightly thrust at the very beginning of the picture to the fabled scene at the chapel. We meet the Groom, and get a glimpse at the life the Bride wanted into. This is where we actually get our first look at the Bride's ex-lover, whom she introduces in quite the fashionable manner. This is where the story turns sour for the yellow-haired warrior. Sadly, we all know the outcome of that chapter of this tale.
The story from there is quite entertaining, spawning numerous chuckles at the hands of Mr. Blonde himself, Michael Madsen. It is interesting to see the lives of the Deadly Vipers now that they have become defunct. A man of Budd's skill should be quite able to be well off in life, but then again, determination is always a factor. He feels that they should die for what they have done, but then again...Where this takes the journey, expected, but all shall be pleased.
We are given a glimpse into the training of Black Mamba at the hands of Pai Mei, the Fist of the White Lotus Clan. It is here we listen to the most entertaining fireside tale created in ages, and where we hear about the Legend of Pai Mei and his 5 Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. To hear this attack described alone, shall make you fear it. The scene will make you shake with laughter at the style in which it is completed. The grain and texture of the visuals mixed with Gordon Liu's (he also played Johnny Mo, General of the Crazy 88's in Volume One) stylized presentation of Pai Mei is one of the finest treats of film nostalgia.
The final confrontation itself is not one that will have the feel that you think. It becomes this truly emotional roller coaster. Bill describes to us what it is we all aspire to be in our lives, a cunning use of Tarentino's observance of the modern myths. It is there we find ourselves questioning the journey. In the end, all good things, and people, find their conclusion, even if it isn't quite the one they (or we) wanted.
The visuals have a much grittier feel this time around, and do not give us a comic, greater than life, impression. We can actually see the things that happen in this installment, actually happen, to some degree of course. The cinematography will not let the audience down, have no fear. QT has always had a great eye, maybe it once belonged to Elle, and he really puts is to the finest use.
One thing that was extremely noteworthy of Volume One was its soundtrack/score. There are certain emotions that can only be brought about when the right audio is combined with the visual, and QT has it down to science. Again, the score reflects this chapters mood and intentions, but it isn't the fast-paced, high energy sound of the first. We hear from a good friend, the Man in Black, Johnny Cash, as well as Robert Rodriguez, who brings us some quality vibes, along with the RZA once more.
The acting is far beyond anything we have seen yet. David Carradine is the treat, in all honesty. His wisdom of the world is brought to us through Bill, and in turn we learn from the man we want to hate, but find it hard to. Uma Thurman's voyage through the character she helped to create is sublime. She brings about the best and the worst characteristics of this ill-lived woman, and brings about bloody satisfaction in a way unlike anyone else. When the two share the light, the love that exudes is easily over-whelming, but at the same time quite underplayed.
Be prepared. This might be the best thing you will see in a long time. In a world where all we see in the theatres are re-hashed ideas, sequels, and adapted films, this saga is the freshest thing sent to us in quite a long time. What has been witnessed will truly be a movie that will outlive the bounds and limits of the cinema around it, and set new standards, new obstacles. Get ready to complete the journey, and bear witness to mercy unlike any other, at the hands of Black Mamba, assassin supreme of the DiVA'S, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad!",1088899200,5,5400,4.472137791286728

Kill Bill Vol. 2 has nowhere near the action that Vol. 1 had, and Tarantino decided to take a more ""story mode"" approach to end this series. We go deeper into the past of The Bride and Bill and get a better understanding of their relationship. The only real action sequences here is her fight with Elle and her training with Pai Mai, other than that don't expect a whole lot. You may be wondering why I left out Budd and Bill, but I will not ruin the surpises. However, with the lack of action in this movie, Tarantino goes so deep into the story that you kind of figure that you don't need all of the action that was contained in Vol 1. You also find out what The Bride's real name is (actually, if you look real close in Vol. 1 you can spot it, but you have to look fast!) but this is the first time you actually get to hear it. The ending was a little dissapointing as you would expect more out of the final ""boss"" fight, but it was surprising to say the least.",1088380800,2,1074,4.046948356807512

The action scenes were anti-climatic and the story seemed to rush along. I guess the loose ends were finally brought together. Great performances by Caradine and Thurman though and we finally found out why Bill wanted to kill the Bride. Of course I think that one should see the first film before seeing this one.

1417976,4,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino is really a great director who manages, in his movies, to extract the best from the actors! In Kill Bill 2, he gets great performances from the pair David Carradine and Uman Thurman.
The premise of these movies seemed very simple in the first one: ""Tarantino decides to make an action movie!"". The guy mixed and homaged most of the best things in old martial arts movies, like Indiana Jones in the 80's - 90's revisited some of the best parts of old adventure movies from the 40's - 50's, just adding new modern elements, and a new look at those things.
What's great in these movies is the fact that Tarantino really does a homage! In this second movie, when he gives those zooms in the ""Pai-Mei's touching his beard look"" it's impossible not to laugh, and, at the same time, try to understand why in Kill Bill this is so cool, while in those old B-movies these scenes were just... well... not so great!
Other point about these two movies is the balance and contrast between them. The first is pure action and hints for some reflection. The second is a bit more reflection and less action, which makes it very interesting to watch them together.
In this second one we finally see some of the motivations (or over-motivations, or better over-reactions that caused the events in the first movie). There's also a nice trick about the bride's name and her relationship with Bill. We can see that some details have been given already in the first movie, we just have missed them in a first glance!
The ending of this movie is that made me feel a bit disappointed though! As I put in the title, this is all great! Kill Bill is pure-over-the-top-movie-technique, and there's no way I could give less than 99 stars of 100 to it. Maybe, it's just a matter of taste, by my part, by I didn't like the death of Bill...
I'm sure this is no spoiler,  this is the movie title, and in the trailers they already told us that ""the Bride will Kill Bill"". This is a vengeance movie and he is supposed to die, because he makes bad things.
However, in my humble opinion, the trouble is that we get to know him more than we should! I mean, we find out about his story with the Bride, we know what he has done and felt for her, we figure out that he isn't an one-dimensional bad guy, etc. That is, he could even be a main anti-hero character in other movie (called just Bill Kills), and people would love him!
The way things are shown, kill him becomes something not so easy, and, unfortunately, not very satisfactory either!
When I saw an interview with Uma Thurman, and she said the movie was about a lot of things, including redemption, I couldn't disagree more! This is not a movie about redemption at all.
In no moment the bride considers the hypothesis of forgiving any of the guys that messed with her! Or, otherwise, consider that it might not be wise to kill one or other of them! That she could just punish them somehow, but not necessarily kill them!
In the end, she becomes just a one-dimensional character. When everything is said and done, we see that there wasn't any moment when the movie could change its route. Kill Bill doesn't transcend those old vengeance martial arts that inspired it! It gives a new look at them, but it is still one of them, maybe one of the best of them, but I wouldn't say superior, in no way!
Well, there's hope... Who knows we won't see a third movie, and we just find out that Pai Mei didn't really teached the Bride the fatal technique that kills Bill in the end. Who knows, we won't see something like Pai Mei, in spirit, waking up Bill...",1087776000,2,3573,4.42185128983308

So there it was Kill Bill Vol. 1, and to make a long story short i rented it, loved it, and this brings us to this movie, Kill Bill Vol. 2. So if you're one of those who think you won't like this movie or Vol. 1, you're probably WRONG. The action and gore was definetly more intense in vol. 1 but there was still plenty of action and brilliant dialogue in this conclusion. In particular, the fight scene with darryl hannah was excellent, the training with the karate instructor was to say the least, entertaining, & the close quarters that michael madsen puts Uma in, is something to see. I really enjoyed this movie more than any other Quentin Film, and recommend it to any action, Quentin, karate, swordfighting or just plain asskicking movie fans......",1087603200,3,853,4.545454545454546
1417978,4,B00005AQ65,"The second and final chapter of Quentin Tarantino's revenge epic, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is not the tour-de-force that ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is. It is instead the re-affirmation that Tarantino is one of the best directors we have today.
Where ""Volume 1"" is a non-stop, leave-you-breathless pursuit of vengence, ""Volume 2"" is more pensive. In ""Volume 2,"" we learn more about the relationship between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and Bill (David Carridine.) On display is more of the wondeful Tarantino dialogue, first made famous in ""Pulp Fiction.""
Uma Thurman's commanding screen presence from ""Volume 1"" is continued in ""Volume 2."" These movies are her's, and she is fantastic.
We get to see much more of Bill this time around, and David Carridine brings just the right touches to the character. Bill is a man who knows full well the horrors he has inflicted on the Bride, and Carridine effuses his portrayal with the right amounts of pain, forlorn, venom and self-rightousness.
Daryl Hannah reprises her role as Elle Driver from ""Volume 1."" Elle is so sublimely evil a character, you can see the joy it was for Hannah to play.
The Bride and Elle have an incredible fight in cramped quarters, and the reveals that take place during the encounter are both shocking and completely satisfying.
As Kung Fu master Pai Mei, Gordon Liu is another actor who is clearly having fun with his role. Costumed with giant, fluffy white eyebrows, and an extremely long beard, Liu uses both for comic effect with terrific results. Pai Mei is not your typical martial arts master, full of solemnity. Rather, he is quick tempered, as both the audience and the Bride discover quite quickly.
""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" does stand on it's own as a film, but when combined with it's predecessor, it will stand as a monument to film making, paying homage to all of it's influences, from Japanese ""grindhouse"" films of the 70s, to the westerns of John Ford. Tarantino is the ultimate film student who never went to film school, and now he's showing us just how much he's learned.",1087603200,7,2044,4.809659090909091
1417979,3,B00005AQ65,"When we finished volume 2 of Kill Bill it left us at a stage were we were dying to see the concluding chapter. This is pretty much what we expected for the volume 2, except... it is hardly anything like the first chapter. In the second we don't get as much martial arts, actually we hardly get any, we only get a tiny bit which takes place in a trailer. Also, Uma Thurman doesn't really do much action in this, although she plays the part well. What I liked was the beginning when it shows you a flashback of the chapel massacre. I also liked it when Uma was burried alive, it made it look quite scary. But, a lot of the dialogue in this can be quite boring and un-interesting as Quentin usually gives us good dialogue, which can educate and entertain us. The last half-an-hour of the film is set in Bill's house, and it's just a lot of talking really, with a tiny bit of flashbacks and her comeback against Bill is nothing cool. Also, when she goes to get revenge on the other two killers, she doesn't wven kill them. The woman with the eye-patch just gets stabbed in the eye and we think she's goanna get cjopped up. The other killer, Bud, doesn't even get killed by the bride, the woman with the eye-patch betrayes him. It is exciting to see the concluding chapter, but don't expect what you saw in the first part. The only scene I really enjoy is when she gets berrayed alive. Scary.",1087603200,,1387,4.297709923664122
1417980,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino has once again outdone himself with Vol. 2 of the delightfully fun Kill Bill saga. While there are no big surprises in store, the film is nonetheless extremely engrossing and fun, full of kinetic energy, amazing stunts, and a great cast to boot.
Uma Thurman is terrific once more, and it was good to see more of Michael Madsen, David Carradine, and of course, the irresistible Darryl Hannah. While the second half (Volume) is a bit more talky than the first, the plot manages to grab the viewer and refuses to let go until the very satisfying ending. The slower moving film allows for some brilliantly campy Tarantino dialogue.and for the actors to shine in the dramatic story.
This is an entirely different experience than the first film, but that's not a bad thing. While the first was one delicious action sequence after another, the conclusion concentrates more on unfolding the story, with all the tension, but much less of the gore and violence. Some people were disappointed in this installment, but pure Tarantino fans will rejoice at the wonderful simplicity of it all. I was actually pleasantly surprised because the two films are so different.
The crisp cinematography is fantastic and the black and white scenes work very well. One of the best Tarantino sequences captured on film is when The Bride, whose real name we finally get to learn by the way, visits Pai Mei, to train and learn how to kill Bill. He is truly one of the funniest characters on film and definitely adds to the already rich story. Neither better or worse than its predecessor, take this for what it is, a wonderful Tarantino film, and enjoy. This gets a solid A.",1087516800,,1664,4.7612456747404845

This movie completes the Kill Bill epic and does it well.  Many are dissapointed by the lack of action in the film and they are right.  There is far less action in the movie as vol. 2 goes more for plot and character development.  Don't be shyed away though, the fight scnenes that there are are incredible just like in the first.
Vol. 2 is more for people who like good movies and care what happens with the plot.  ""Common-Folk"" need non-stop attention getting like in Vol. 1. Character interactions in Vol. 2 are long and drawn out, so you have to really be enjoying the story.  There is a scene where Uma gets buried alive and if you watch this in the dark with surround sound you will feel like you are being buried alive yourself.  When I saw this in theatres I felt my chest getting tight and noticed how much I suddenly hated trying to breath.  What a mind trip!

1417984,5,B00005AQ65,"I saw this movie on opening night, and I couldn't believe what I was watching. From the opening sounds of Ennio Morricone's ""A Silhoutte of Doom,"" I knew that I was gonna be in for another wild ride on the Tarantino Express. The opening reminded me of the old Hitchcockian films of the 50s, along with the film noir that took place during that period. The way the incident at the Two Pines wedding chapel was handled expertly, with great cinematography by Robert Richardson. Everything from the sun glaring off the surfaces gave it a certain glow that added to the environment of the entire movie.

The stuff The Bride has to go through is unbelievable. If you thought wiping out all of O-Ren Ishii's Crazy 88 army was gonna be a heavy burden, it becomes more of an emotional and mental burden for the character in this volume. Budd plays the almost average Joe, and close relative to Bill, that got comfortable with himself in his confided tracker trailer in the middle of nowhere, where as Elle Driver is a caniving, yet beautiful, one-eyed bitch that you just love to hate. Gordon Liu gives new life to Pai Mei and delivers the goods for his character. Continuing the mythology from the martial arts Shaw Brothers movies from the 70s, Pai Mei is an unrelenting master of craft, with little compassion in his heart. And, of course, we come to Bill. Bill is a supercool ""human snake,"" so to speak. His actions almost reflect what he's thinking. His charm is dark, with witty humor. From the scene of the Two Pines Massacre, before he wipes out the entire wedding party, he says to ""The Bride's"" groom, ""Isn't it bad luck to see the bride before the wedding?"" The groom replies, ""I like to live dangerously."" Bill gives him a look, with a smirk, replying, ""I know just what you mean.""

For die-hard fans of Vol. 1, it may seem like a stretch. This volume is 2 1/2 hours, unlike Vol. 1's hour and 50 minutes. Instead of a fast paced interwoven series of various non-linear flashbacks and occurances, this time we get to chance to see more dimensional characters. Budd's character who's more of a reclusive, redneck alcoholic that's on bitter terms with his brother. Elle Driver is, well, a evil one-eyed beauty, as I stated before. And Bill is ""truly and utterly Bill."" ""The Bride"" is given a name this time, but I won't spoil that for you. Instead of the hard-ass cold killing machine she was in Vol. 1, she becomes more of a 3 dimensional character this time. We see her in life or death situations, where her true emotions arise. When she reaches her destination, she changes from the cold assassin, to something she would never expect to become within a matter of seconds after being shot in the head 4 years ago.

This is the Spaghetti Western of all Spaghetti Westerns. Even though this wasn't filmed in Italy, of course, Quentin pulls it off with ease. Vol. 1 ended with a wham, where as Vol. 2 ends with a bang. A beautiful continuation of the story. I couldn't picture it ending any better.

This time around however, the action feels a little under-cooked, and while there are some razor-sharp trademark Tarantino lines and some great fight scenes (Especially the nastiest cat-fight ever committed to film between Uma's Bride and Daryll Hannah's Elle Driver), some scenes drag on for too long and halfway through you get the feeling that this whole exercise could have been compacted into a single 3-Hour film. The highlights are the aforementioned EYE-catching brawl and Pei Mei's tutalage of the Bride. Still. it lacks momentum enough to keep the interest for long. Nevertheless, it's very refreshing to see a film bereft of CGI screen mugging and Hollywood pretty boys posing through the whole movie.

All the hype about how vol 2 was even better then part 1 is the biggest load of B.S I think has ever been contrapted. Was it fans who started that rumour? Or just a way the company made sure people went to see it so it made its money back?
The plot kicked off from where the last one finished, and it unveals even more dumb motives and bad fight scenes. The trailer park guy beeing killed by the ever so threatning, tough looking, eye patch wearing assisin was too predictable! But not as predictable as the way Bill is killed! When you suffer through the boring dialog of a flashback of Bill and Uma then you straigh away figure out how Bill is going to die. Note there's no ""!"" on the end of that! If you cant predict it, theres somthing wrong with you! It was seen coming a mile away!
At least the movie didn't have 10 minute long staring compititions this time around, or the mask of zorro gang lead by the fearless leader of no emotion and super-abilty's to stare at nothing Lucy Lu.
Kill Bill 2 is a waste of time. It dosent bother me, seeing as how I didn't like either film, but neither film played off each other too good, the first was action filled with blood and voilence, the second was completly long and boring dialog and the action is minimal. The speechs where too long, kind of reminds you of watching the Pro Wrestling and you hear ""shut up and wrestle""
After vewing Kill Bill 2, I rate it 1, but if there was option to go 0, i'd do that, just to be one below the first movie!
The ending is too unbeleiavble, and not satasfying.... this Bill seems to have a myth of beeing some super bad guy, the story that folded out led me to beleive that the whole thing was just one big stupid untought out plot. If maybe Bill was a more sadistic killer who deserved to die, and you felt he did, then you probably would have seen me rate it a bit higher, maybe a half star?

(I know a lot of you's suck Q's dick, but im just sayin, for an action movie, this sucks, okay for a drama, its alright, but Tarantino can do waaay better dialogue. You just cant admit it, & youll probably click ""not helpful!!"" HA! HA!)
I was so pissed off at the cinemas on what had the potential to be one of the greatest films ive seen. I know tarantino trademark is witty & ""im cool"" dialogue, but it just didn't work in Kill Bill 2. It tried too hard to be like Pulp Fiction, & failed. Kill Bill is a lie! False advertisement, promotional posters saying ""THE BRIDE IS BACK FOR THE FINAL CUT!"" What cut? Kill Bill 2 isn't even an action movie, it turns into a dam drama film, which wouldve been fine had it have been another film. Or cut down the unnecessary scenes & made it one f@!#en shorter movie. And even then, because of the anti-climatic battle with Bill (witch lasts roughly 4 seconds!!), this movie suffers. Vol 1 started out as what was sure to be an amazing vol 2...but...sadly...no! Fair enough, we get story, emotions, drama e.t.c Theres hardly any action which is bulls@#t! Vol 2 is a marketing ploy.
I was givin it a chance all the way to the end b4 i judge it, cuz i hoped the battle with Bill it would save the movie...It couldve. Cuz there are some great scenes from the film, but it didnt. DIDNT! Bill was cool, but he ended up bieng all talk & no action, just like the movie, ALL TALK & NO ACTION! Leave that to Pulp & Dogs. Not Kill Bill! I thought this would be unique.
Im not angry, im just sad that Quentin Tarantino, one of my fav directors of all time has let me down so much.
What were u thinkin Q? Love story? Fair enough. But why is there a sword still in the posters? Theres like 2 mins of swordplay.
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED! Vol 1 unique & stylish. Vol 2 slow drawn out. Your Quentin, not Sergio Leone dude! I really wated to love this film, maybe if i saw it again from a different P.O.V id find something to like, but for now, im watchin the Matrix trilogy (& Kill Bill Vol 1!!!)

1417988,3,B00005AQ65,"Although I am probably going to get many ""Not Helpful"" review ratings, I was disappointed by the follow up to the absolutely brilliant Kill Bill Volume 1. When I came out of seeing Volume 1, I could not stop reliving the amazing sequences, choreography, humor, music, and fundamental originality from one of my favorite directors. While some critics dismissed Vol. 1 as all show and no substance, I for one believe that there is ample room for movies to create their own universe. The elegance of the fight sequences (especially the heavenly final bout between the characters played by Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu) are worth the price of admission. One could argue that Tarentino was showing off, but he has the craft to do so and make an audience take notice. But enough about Kill Bill Volume 1 and on to Volume 2.
I went in to see Volume 2 with high expectations and had heard that the movie was less visceral and more cerebral than its predecessor, which seemed to please those who had found Volume 1 to lack heart. While it's hard to disagree with that, I for one found myself wanting to like this movie so much, yet not being able to do so for extended periods of time.
The Good:
Uma Thurman's role in Volume 2 requires even more of her, both physically and in emotional terms and she nails all of her scenes.
Quentin Tarantino's stylized direction is simply a marvel. He changes not only hues but styles and genres that are homages to his heroes but never rips them off. The black and white scenes are gorgeous, especially the one in which The Bride exits the chapel to meet Bill for the first time in this movie. The light and absolute stillness of the camera elevates that scene to high art.
The fight sequences, while not anywhere as outrageous and colorful, as those in Volume 1, are a marvel as they find the humor and humanity while being executed like heart surgery. There is a scene between Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen and another between Hannah and Thurman that show how to stage suspense in the smallest of scales versus those in Volume 1.
One of the most effective sequences in the movie involves one of the characters being put in a tight situation (don't want to give too much away) and how she manages to deal with it is truly a cinematic masterpiece. There is a scene basically fades to black and you hear some noises that are more frightening than anything that the ""horror"" genre has to offer.
Volume 2 really grounds some of the motivation for what occurred in Volume 1 and gives both The Bride and Bill valid reasons for doing what they do. Both Thurman and David Carradine shine in their scenes together and many unanswered questions get their due explanation.
The Bad
The movie spends way too much time at the beginning reminding us of what transpired in Volume 1 and I don't think it is necessary even for those who did not see Volume 1.
While some are praising Michael Madsen's performance (I've loved the actor in many of his performances, especially Reservoir Dogs and Thelma and Louise), I was bored by him and unlike the rest of the cast, he seemed to be in another movie.
Too much non-essential dialogue that took away from the narrative. Although Tarantino has a gift for dialogue as proven in Pulp Fiction and the underrated Jackie Brown, here the words seem scattered or didactic depending on the scene.
The first 40 minutes of the movie were a big yawn, and I've never ever experienced that with Tarentino. You may call it lack of sophistication on my part, but much of the ""witty"" dialogue at the church was not funny nor thought-provoking. Even the small details that the massacre really took place ..... instead of ..... are extraneous.
Daryl Hanah does not get enough screen time. Although I am not a big fan of hers (except in my guilty pleasure Summer Lovers), Tarantino shortchanges the fans as he has created a character that was so enticing in Volume 1 and promised to be much more prominent in Volume 2.
The Solution
While I give Volume 1 5+ stars, this one warrants 3 stars as I don't think it holds up well in and of itself. Although marketing considerations and even artistic ones made a compelling case to present this story in two parts, I think that the movie would have worked even better by trimming some scenes and releasing it as one. If Tarantino was able to work anime into Volume 1, he could have certainly worked with the arc of The Bride's ""work"" into one 10 star movie even if the director and Miramax executives keep insisting that it works better this way. I disagree and would have loved to see a 3 to 3  movie (it would not have been unprecedented) in which I could experience the entire journey in one sitting.
Seeing the closing credits confirmed my belief that Volume 2 would have worked better incorporated into Volume 1. Instead of having to look back at how much I enjoyed Vivica Fox, Lucy Liu, The 5-6-7-8's, (just to name a few) I could have seen the flash and the heart in one sitting. Having said this, it's never a waste to see ANY of Tarantino's work. my review just reflects that while Volume 1 can stand alone, Volume 2 did  not stand alone well for me. I was still amazed and thrilled in parts, but boredom is something that one should never ever experience in a Tarantino movie as he's always putting something in every scene to keep you engaged. I can't wait for his next flick.",1086825600,5,5365,4.529896907216495
1417989,5,B00005AQ65,"First of all, anyone who believes that Quentin Tarantino had a smash on his hands with Vol. 1, but botched it up with Vol. 2 is SORELY mistaken. Quentin filmed both Volumes 1 and 2 as ONE FILM! It was late in the post-production process that the decision was made to split the film into two seperate pieces. It's a package deal here. People need to judge this as one film. The second half, while slower paced, is a brilliant piece of work, and it truly wraps up this epic tale of revenge. The dialogue is pure Tarantino, and the showdown between Bill and The Bride is simply breathtaking. This is what great filmmaking is all about.",1086220800,4,632,4.410256410256411
1417990,5,B00005AQ65,"This movie is great.  I had just seen kill bill vol. 1 about 1 week before this and I rushed out to buy the dvd immediatly.  I have to admit when I eneterd the theater I was not expecting part 2 to be any where near as good as part 1; sequels never are. However when I left the theatre I couldn't believe how completely amazing this movie was.  Part 1 was full of action and lots of violence, in fact some of the best action I have ever seen.  Going into the theatre I was expecting much less action from the 2nd, and in a sense I was right.  Although 2 doesn't have nearly as much action as the first, it makes up for it in story.  But don't get me wrong the fight between the bride and elle is one of the coolest yet shortest fights that I have ever seen.  If you watched this movie together with the first you will see how diverse it is. The fact that Tarantino could have anamation, black and white, excessivly violent action, romance, drama, and twisted humor all together in one film and on top of that make it work unbelievably well is reason enough for anyone to buy this film, and it is also why I say the Kill Bill series is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen a crap load of movies after all I am chris the immature movie expert/ student film maker.

1417991,5,B00005AQ65,"Last weekend I saw the movie. I had seen Kill Bill vol. 1 a few weeks ago, and it was very exciting, so I was looking forward to seeing part two. I enjoyed Lucy Liu's performance, she is a great actress. The sound track was exelent, y can't wait to buy the CD.
I thought the movie was too bloody... I came out of the cinema dripping blood!!!, but it was very funny anyway.

1417992,5,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino found the perfect form for this film. Now that I've seen Vol. 2, I can say for sure that the split works perfectly well. And yes, sure, I would like to see it as a whole reunited film some day, but now I see that the 2 volumes strategy works in an entertaining and artistic way too.
I won't say much about plot. You can find that everywhere else. It's true that the first volume was all action, and this one is more of a complete films. It also makes the previous one even better, because now you see the substance behind all that virtuos action scene.
The final dialogue between The Bride and Bill is the great pay off. It puts the whole thing in a new perspective, and you'll find yourself liking that Bill a bit too. He is a tragic chraracter, as much as the Bride and the others. This is the great thing here, there is no good and bad side really. I mean, The Bride herself was one of them, and only motherhood made her change her ways. But think of O-Ren... She became what she was because of a tragic childhood, so she's a victim too. Everyone is a victim here, and everyone is a killer because of that... as a song I heard recently said ""you become the monster / so the monster will not break you"". Think of Vernita's daughter... she is a victim of The Bride too. She might want satisfaction some day, and if she killed Beatrix, no one could really object. Of couse, what maked Beatrix more human and closer to us is that she became a mother and that made her a real person, not only a roaring rampage killer. She trascended the killer she was, and almost pay with her life.
And Bill... when he explains the reasons behind his actions, you'll find it hard not to simpathize at least in some ways with him.
All of this, plus the brilliant single-minded and virtuos directing (Tarantino has become a great director now; the great screenwriter is no surprise of course) make this one a milestone film.",1085616000,,1915,4.322222222222222
1417993,4,B00005AQ65,"The first volume of Kill Bill is one of the most amazing, unique and original films of all time.  A definitive peak for Tarantino, it follows the Bride's (Uma Thurman) ""roaring rampage of revenge"" at the people who killed 8 people in her wedding chapel, including her fiance and, she thinks, her unborn baby.  In what I called ""Tarantino's Outrageous Adventure"", we get a scene after scene in which Tarantino throws at us spectacles bigger, weirder, more amazingly carried out and awesome (literally ""filled with owe"") then the last one, culminating in what is surely cinema's greatest martial arts battle and heart pounding cliffhanger ending.
The biggest disappointment of Kill Bill, volume 2, is that Tarantino abandons the powerful narrative form that made the first film so addictive.  The second Kill Bill film lacks the you-ain't-seen-nothing-yet lan of the first.  In every scene of 'Kill Bill', Tarantino threw at us enough ideas, actions sequences and narrative points that could be highlights of entire different films (indeed, they were often just that - Tarantino's ""appropriation"" and ""homage"" to other films is just what makes him such a master of cinema).  It's not that the second film doesn't have great scenes and ideas - it certainly does - but that it languishes on every one of them, instead of flashing it at us and then moving directly to the next one.
I'm also disappointed at how little the film discloses about the past of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or about the relationship between them.  We never learn as much about Budd (Michael Madsen) or Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) as we did about O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) in the first film.  Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), who was coolly discarded in the first film in front of her daughter's eyes, is hardly even mentioned.
Instead, this is Bill's film, indeed more his film then The Bride's.  David Carradine deserves all the credit he received for his masterful portrayal, but Tarantino's writing doesn't do him justice.  Instead of the sadistic, criminal but honorable monster he is in the first film, we get a domesticated Bill, who tried to kill The Bride because she broke his heart.
Maybe my criticism is unfair - maybe I'm judging Kill Bill, vol. 2, against what I wanted it to be instead of against Tarantino's vision.  Taking in itself, there is much to love about this sequel.  The opening scene, in which we get a look at the massacre at Two Pines, is absolutely perfect.  In it we get introduced for the first time, to the title character, and Bill is everything he's supposed to be: articulate, intelligent, and creepingly murderous.
If the film never manages to match the kind of intensity of the opening scene, or the wonders of the first part, it is nonetheless very enjoyable.  Among the delights, ex-Diva Budd, an alcoholic bouncer in a nudie bar, a deadly confrontation between The Bride and the one-eyed Daryl Hanna, and a fantastic flashback to the Bride's training by over-the-top Chinese master Pei Mei (Gordon Liu).
Kill Bill did not live up to its potential - when Bill finally dies (surely you're not surprised), he goes in a (predictable) whimper rather then a climatic bang.  But Tarantino's world, film making, and ear to dialogue makes Kill Bill, vol. 2, one of the best films of the year, and a must see movie.  Just as The Bride told Bill, Tarantino can tell those of us who have yet to watch it ""You and I have un-finished business"", and if, like Bill's death, what you get is something of let down, it is still the much awaited conclusion to a real epic quest.",1085616000,,3573,4.796416938110749
1417994,4,B00005AQ65,"Of course I'm referring to the dorky commercials for David's old Tai Chi videotapes there used to be. Carradine's performance steals the show in this ""sequel"" (which was supposed to be one continuous movie with the first one), and it can be said that like Travolta after Pulp Fiction, Carradine will get a lot more jobs in Hollywood. This film I enjoyed more than the first one, and the near Anti Hero performance as ""Bill"" that Carradine gives is one of the main reasons.",1085529600,,472,4.630952380952381
1417995,4,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill: Volume 1 was brilliant and definitely one of the most exciting, pulse-pounding cinema treats of last year.  Heavily influenced by kung-fu flicks, Tarantino set expectations at an unusually high level for the second part, promising itself to be a Western pastiche.  Of course, Tarantino is hardly a conformist and what initially struck me when watching Volume 2 was that it seemed to take great glee in undermining all my expectations of the Western elements I was looking for.  Take the promised backstory to the massacre at the chapel - we get a tense work-up with Bill coming to visit The Bride and then we hear but never see the massacre that ensues.  Take Budd, a bloated has-been who sits in his trailer guzzling beer and wearing a cowboy hat, the very picture of a genre truly dead and buried, past its glory days.  It's clear from here that Tarantino's toying with his audience's expectations, becoming a true master of suspense (notably in the scenes with Bill) and showing us what 'Western' means today.  It's not cops and robbers and epic gunfights but trailer trash violence Jackass-style where old-school warriors are misfits in a dead landscape.
Still, Tarantino's not lost his love of retro-pastiche and these still provide his most entertaining sequences.  The fight with Daryl Hannah is hilariously brilliant, with the two heroines reduced to fighting with foodstuffs and toilet bowls.  This and the training sequences between The Bride and Pai Mei.  Using the zoom shot, the begrudging cruel master and cheesy fight scenes, Tarantino manages to give his love for the genre with a touch of humanity when we get to see how The Bride uses her teachings to break free of a coffin in which she has been buried alive.
The main criticisms levellled at Volume 2 seem to be that it is slower than Volume 1 and has a masochistic attitude towards women.  The first is admitedly true in sequences and this never reaches the freewheeling fun of Volume 1, though once it gets going, Volume 2 is just as much a force to be reckoned with and is certainly anything but stale.  The second is a hard one, especially seen as The Bride is put through just about every kind of punishment possible, be it torture, near-death or the loss of her daughter.  In particular, the resolution, where an assassin grants her life because she's pregnant might seem hokey.  But Tarantino pulls it off to make this self-proclaimed 'roaring rampage of revenge' exciting and fun enough to get past any sentimentality.  A lot of people sneered at her love for Bill, but surely this was levelled by the apparent respect she had for him and Tarantino's acknowledgement that love cannot be simply transformed into hate so simply.  Thurman gives it her all as well, proving that she's one of the best actresses of her generation in a role that will probably define her for years to become.  She's impressed in her roles in Pulp Fiction and Gattaca, but never before has her performance been so determined and committed.  Of course, she's helped by a superb supporting cast.  Carradine exudes a surprising degree of menace and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are both a hoot.
Okay, so Volume 2 isn't perfect, but along with its first part, it's the one of the most interesting, thrilling cinema treats in a fair while and even if the style isn't really your cup of tea, it's sheer exuberance (not to mention Tarantino's obvious talent and attention to detail) should be applauded.",1085529600,3,3464,4.812816188870152
1417996,5,B00005AQ65,"Wow!  A short word I know but that was the feeling I still had when I left the theater after watching the Kill Bill Vol. 2 for the sixth time.  Beatrix Kiddo(Uma Thurman) remains on her path of revenge but little does she know the path is about to throw her a few curves. Along with the physical challanges of her quest,in Vol. 2 we see her come alive emotionally; in a variety of situations that are both scary and heartwrenching.  Throughout this movie we are entertianed by a supporting cast of former and active killers.  Bud(Michael Madsen),Bill's down and out brother;is the most interesting to watch.  A short conversation between Bill(David Carradine) and Bud, eludes to a history that would have been nice too have gotten into;as it is Tarantino leaves it up too our imaginations.  From there on we see Beatrix's strengh,now and when she was younger and after a thrilling dispatch of Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah)Beatrix's anger turns towards Bill.  We learn that Bill is more than he seems.  A lowdown murdering snake too be sure but he also shows us his ""sweet"" and tender side and with his ""ace in the hole"" he begins a systematic breakdown of her defenses.  Both actors do a wonderful job of acting and the only reason Uma and David will not see Oscar nominations is because action films are generally overlooked.  Hopefully I'm wrong on this one.  The ending is an emotional roller coaster,which leaves you waiting for the inevitable and when it comes,you may or may not like it.  Personally, I think I have a better ending for this movie but I'll keep it too myself.  In any event, this movie left me feeling good and eager too see it again.  A wonderful romp.  Well done!

1417997,5,B00005AQ65,"If you have seen the first one this latest edition is slightly different. Rather thatn a kungfu flick this movie is more of a spaghetti western. It is executed perfectly keeping the whimsical characters the funny hijinks and the off the wall fight scenes while tieing the story up pure genious. The chinese martial arts master is by far the best character in the movie with his random beard swinging and funny expressions.

1417998,4,B00005AQ65,"Uma Thurman plays Beatrix Kiddo out for revenge for the killings of her fiance and friends during a wedding rehearsal. During her search for Bill (David Carradine) we see chapters in her life where she is trained by Pai Mei, a white bearded and bushy eybrowed martial arts master, played by Gordon Liu. This scene is typical of Chinese martial arts films where the student goes through tough training with the guidance of a master. The training comes into great use when she meets Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill's brother who shoots her with rock salt, drugs her and then buries her alive. After her miraculous escape she meets Elle (Daryl Hannah), a fellow student and the best fight sequence of the film takes place. After amazingly surviving the gruelling fights, she finally tracks down Bill and confronts him with her five touch exploding heart move learned from Pai Mei.
This was an exciting film, reminiscent of the Hong Kong Martial arts films of revenge. Added to the usual plot is Tarantino's own style of dialogue, which I find to be rather like verbal diarrhea. Sometimes you are left wondering what the dialogue has to do with the film. One example is when Bill starts talking about Superman and Clark Kent. You get the feeling that Tarantino is trying to add some of this dialogue because he's been having philosophical talks by himself and wanted to tell someone about his great thoughts. All in all this was a good quality film with good action fight scenes and great editing.

Quentin Tarantino is one genius of a filmmaker, masterfully combining a plethora of genres to create something quite profound.  I laughed, cried, cringed and cheered during this film.  I loved it so much, in fact, that I saw it 4 times in the theater, it is the kind of powerhouse of a film that you can watch over and over and over and over again and never EVER get tired of.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who loves movies!  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed!",1084924800,4,652,4.217741935483871
1418000,3,B00005AQ65,"I was a great lover of Kill Bill Volume One.  I saw it in the theater with a buddy of mine, then forced my girlfriend to watch it when it came out on DVD.  She enjoyed it enough to accompany me to the theater last weekend and watch Volume Two.  I wish we hadn't gone now . . .
The thing that was so appealing about Volume One was how it made fun of films of old: excessive bloody violence (literally spraying gallons of crimson across the screen), corny music overlays, ridiculously impossible fight sequences, and a very old plot (revenge).  I absolutely loved the fact that an informed movie-goer could laugh at the gore spilling across the screen because it was meant to be that way.  Dark comedy some might call it, but it was actually a parody of sorts.  I was expecting something similar (maybe even more tantalizing) in Volume 2.  But it was not to be.
Gone were the extended and entertaining fight scenes, revenge took a back seat to back story (the showing of Bill coming to The Bride's wedding and the ensuing slaughter witnessed at the beginning of Volume One, The Bride's training at the hands of a Kung Fu master, etc.), and the absence of such important items as The Bride's list of people left to kill.
The music, that was so impressive in Volume One, seems to have lost its ""volume"" in this second release also.  It was hardly noticeable.  Whereas in Volume One, it was paramount to the story as a whole.
Although I love good dialogue (and there was some in this film, make no doubt about that), I don't care to have the film maker TELL ME EVERYTHING by having their characters explain all their motivations.  That ruined this film for me.
Now there were interesting aspects to this film, however.  Most notably was the burial and escape of The Bride, and the dialogue of Darryl Hannah after she has a deadly snake bite someone.
I will give the film credit for not being formulaic, too.  I'm beginning to hate that about Hollywood.  This could've gotten overly-smaltzy at the end, but it wasn't.  The Bride's revenge will not be quenched until she kills Bill.
With the entrance of The Bride's unknown child (which we ALL knew would happen after viewing Volume One), it bordered on smaltziness.  It teetered on the line...but didn't go over. THANK GOD!

1418001,5,B00005AQ65,"I met Quentin Tarantino in NY the Tuesday before Vol. 2 opened and couldn't stop telling him how great Vol. 1 was.  When he told me ""Well I hope you like the second one"" I wondered whether it could live up to the standard set by Vol. 1.  But of course, it did.  Vol. 2 is simply amazing.  Pai Mei is a great character with his stereotypical hatred of the ""Japanese fatheads"" and Bill is just mesmerizing.  When Bill starts talking, I just went into a trance.  Tarantino's movies could so easily be boring with the great deal of talking but frankly, the talking scenes are much more entertaining than the action scenes for me.  Whether it's John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talking about foot massages or the metirc system, or Steve Buscemi explaining why he doesn't tip or Harvey Keitel telling you what to do when a customer in a store you're sticking up starts giving you some attitude or when David Carradine is explaining how The Bride is like Superman, it's genius.  It's hard to believe that Quentin Tarantino is only human.  I find it difficult to believe that a human being can write such scripts.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 is just another Tarantino masterpiece.  Nothing less than that.",1084838400,,1190,4.566037735849057
1418002,5,B00005AQ65,"I was expecting Kill Bill, Vol 2 to be much like the first.  I was surprised to find it was a completely different film!  Though I loved the first, it was definitely a pleasant surprise to find the second much more mellow and more about the depth of the characters instead of blood and kung-fu fighting.
Uma Thurmon is back as The Bride, the woman who was set to be married when her ex boss and former ""friends"" (an assassination team) gunned her, her future husband and entire wedding party down.  She got her revenge on the first two members of the Death Squad and in Vol. 2, she's back to take out the other two.. and the ringleader, Bill.
The dialogue is, as always, incredible.  Quentin Tarantino just has a way with words and dialogue that keeps my attention riveted... and keeps me laughing.  Since I like Tarantino's dialogue so much, it was no surprise I liked Vol. 2 so much better than Vol. 1!  This version was much slower paced and seemed more concerned with explaining the characters and their motivations moreso than the first.
Despite being less bloody than the first, there is no shortage of great fights in Vol. 2!  The final fight between Bill and the Bride is EXCELLENT.  I also very much enjoyed her fight with Elle Driver, which was surprisingly funny and very well choreographed.  The fight with Elle was probably one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a movie in a long long time!
As in the first, the acting is top notch.  All the actors are so perfectly matched to the characters they were playing.  Uma Thurmon is totally wonderful and believable as the wronged Bride bent on revenge.  Michael Madsen is great as Budd, the redneck who is a lot smarter than he looks.  Darryl Hannah as Elle, phenominally evil - I don't think they could possibly have cast a better person in that role.  David Carradine finally gets to be seen, playing the infamous Bill.  While he did an excellent job - I have a hard time buying him and the Bride as a couple... though the two definitely have some chemistry on the screen in a mentor/protoge kind of sense.
Overall, while the movie was different than Vol. 1, it was still excellent!  I highly recommend it, especially to Tarantino fans.  5 stars!",1084752000,4,2210,4.526448362720403
1418003,5,B00005AQ65,"Way back in October I went to see Volume 1, mainly because some of my friends were planning on seeing it.  My attitude was, to say the least, greatly changed before the release of Volume 2, which easily stands as the most highly anticipated movie release of my life, so much so that I eventually became concerned that it wouldn't live up to my expectations..  Fortunately, it did stand up, and proved to be the perfect companion to the already fabulous first half, and taken as a whole it stands as one of the finest achievements in film that I've seen..
As most everyone knows, Kill Bill was always intended to be one film, and was only split in half late into production.  This makes it particularly surprising and remarkable that the two Volumes are so extremely different.  All told, there is only about 5-6 minutes of action in the second volume.  Dialogue is, once again, King, easily compensating for the relative lack of it in Volume 1.  Furthermore, it moves in a completely different direction both visually and musically.  Gone are the urban and Japanese settings of the first film, replaced largely by rural settings in Texas and Mexico. The cinematography and editing are starker, and far less flamboyant.(though still far from conventional, for the most part) The more eclectic soundtrack of Volume 1 is replaced by one more fitting of the desert settings, relying heavily on Spaghetti Western style music along with some spanish sounding stuff and a bit of country.  All this means that those of you who loved Vol. 1 need to get the proper mindset coming in, as this is a completely different experience..
With the new emphasis on character and personality I suppose I ought to go into my thoughts on the acting in the film. Personally, I found all the main characters to be quite interesting and/or likable, and the acting was uniformly excellent.  Thurman brings out some genuine sympathy for the Bride, and adds a whole lot more emotional depth to the character than would seem possible after the first film.  Budd defies expectations as he is now a broken down and drunken slob, who is revealed to still have a propensity for sadistic violence. (Madsen does an excellent job of displaying 2 substantially different faces while still remaining the same character)  Elle proves to be more or less EVIL, and perhaps more of a caricature than a character, but I don't mind.  It's also cool how Tarantino leaves you wondering about why she is the way she is until the very end when it just sorta comes together through the final detail we learn about her.(or maybe that's just me) Of course, the real standout is David Carradine as Bill.  Bill defies expectations as well, as he was built up as a sort of mythic villain in the first Volume, and is now revealed, early on, to be far more human, and far more normal than that. He proves to be very likable and fairly sympathetic as well, and Tarantino doesn't cheat us in trying to do this by either excusing or ignoring what he's done. He's particularly excellent at the very end, as is Thurman.
Despite the emphasis on dialogue, what action they have is still first rate.  Each of the fights is very cool, with the fight with Elle being of particular note.  It provides a great contrast to the largely balletic and elegant motions of the House of Blue Leaves fight, as it is remarkably uncontrolled, harsh and brutal. The ending of it is quite hilarious as well, but I won't give it away. The fight with Pei Mei is quite cool as well, and even more stylized and over the top than the HoBL.(albeit in a different way.) In fact, the whole chapter with him is quite excellent, particularly the training montage and the campy silhouettes.  There's also an excellent suspense scene in Budd's part.  I won't give away any specifics, but it really manages to give a sense of claustrophobia and tension despite the fact that you know there is no way the Bride can die at that point.
Many have complained that this is too slowly paced and has too many extraneous scenes. I suppose I see where they're coming from, but I don't think anything should've been removed.  The scene with Budd and his boss isn't absolutely needed, but I think it works because it juxtaposes 2 very different sides of Budd when matched with the following scene of him and the Bride.  The most criticized scene, involving an old friend of Bill's named Esteban, is still useful in my mind, mainly because it provides a buffer between the fight with Elle and the confrontation with Bill.  However, another fight would've been nice, and probably would've made the pacing better. (Though I didn't think it was too slow anyway)  A fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would've been great, and would've proved to be the ultimate homage. (as a friend of mine pointed out) Though Kareem's getting pretty old and maybe he hasn't kept up with his marital arts. Still, one can dream...
The highlight of the film is the final chapter, which is, obviously, the confrontation with Bill.  As many have said, it is primarily verbal, emotional and mental rather than physical.  This will disappoint many, who were hoping for another huge fight.  As great as another fight would've been I think this works better, particularly when you consider the 2 volumes as one film.(which is the only way to do it)  This allows the film to have both an absolutely first-rate action climax and a fantastic emotional climax, something which is exceedingly rare. It's also a pretty gutsy move to have an emotional, sorrowful ending after all the brutality preceding it, but they pull it off, and it turns out to be the best possible ending.

We also see the final two individuals who took part in the onslaught (Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen).  All of the characters are explained very deeply and we know their motives.

1418006,4,B00005AQ65,"Pretty early on, it's quite clear you're watching something great, but about 3/4ths into the infinitely better second leg of Kill Bill, there's a moment that will have your jaw hitting the floor. David Carradine's rugged Bill pulls out a huge butcher knife in front of The Bride and their daughter, wields it with all of his haunting intensity, brings it down with lethal precision...
  ...and makes a sandwich.
 That's right. Quentin Tarantino, the hyper mastermind behind Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, has the honor of creating the best sandwich-making scene in the history of film. Bill plunges the knife into the mayonnaise, lays the meat down piece by piece, and delivers an important monologue in a comically domestic setting that will have you drooling. And I'm not joking. But that's what sets Kill Bill Volume 2 apart from most movies being made today, and nearly everything else in Tarantino's oeuvre. Tarantino knows the importance of, to quote Vincent Vega, ""the little things,"" and the little things include his intricate, often-funny dialogue (somewhat missing from the first installment) that shines nearly as bright as Pulp Fiction. It's back with a vengeance here.

 Even though the movie isn't as violent and has more of Tarantino's legendary chit-chat, it still hops through genre hoops like his best work. The beginning of the film, guided by Uma Thurman's sassy narration, goes back to the infamous wedding chapel where the massacre that started it all occurred. What is so interesting about the scene, though, is how normal everything seems...yet there's a seething undercurrent of tension and suspense to it all. You can feel it during the light banter at The Bride's (I won't reveal her actual name - you have to see the movie for that) rehearsal, a tense conversation between her and Bill, and then in the moments after.
 At first, the movie evokes a Western (Quentin even nods his head to John Ford with a Searchers-inspired shot through the frame of a door). Then the movie switches gears and conjures up that deadly femme-fatale suspense thriller vibe as The Bride gets closer to Bud (Michael Madsen). Then...wait. A flashback, and it's a campy '70' ninja homage as we see The Bride's tutelage under the fierce Pai Mei. This exciting movie never knows when to sit still, and that's what's so great about it. Tarantino, as usual, is punch-drunk with his love for the movies and as often as Bill can wow with dialogue, it's still difficult to top a great catfight.

 At 44, Daryl Hannah is sexier than ever (yes, even Splash) as Elle Driver, and seeing her in an ultra-violent knock-down-drag-out catfight with the equally sexy Uma Thurman has to be the ultimate Tarantino geek fantasy fulfilled (count me in!). I won't divulge specifics of their brawl (which reportedly took 3 weeks to shoot), but it's one of many applause-worthy moments of the movie. Driver could be the most vicious and scary villains of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and damn is she cool. Much like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, her stint in Bill should be enough to rescucitate a career that hasn't been going so well lately. I can just see that freak, Tarantino, sitting in his home watching the stupid remake of Rear Window, Hannah's forgettable roles in Grumpy Old Men and Wall Street, and saying, ""There is one dead-sexy, scary chick underneath all that."" The Bride and Driver have one of the most electrifying scenes in the movie, and unlike tripe like the Matrix sequels, Tarantino and editor Sally Menke know when to cut, move on, and - best of all - create a final standoff between the two ladies that will have you peeing your pants.
 And all of that is great stuff. But, remarkably, what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than its limb-chopping predecessor is the movie's final act, where everything comes together and Tarantino's true theme of the movie - motherhood - comes to full fruition. The movie, at the most perfect points, has the ability to surprise you, and the biggest surprise of them all is that Bill has its most suspenseful, powerful, and shockingly brilliant moments in the rather quiet final section.
 I've seen Tarantino outdo himself before (the climax of Jackie Brown, Michael Madsen's vicious dismember-fest in Reservoir Dogs), but what he does with this seemingly simple tale of revenge simply goes beyond explanation. I can explain part of it: David Carradine. The dude just exudes 'cool' with every scratchy syllable, every squinty look, and every confident step. I heard that Tarantino originally wanted Warren Beatty, and I am sure-as-hell glad that fell through, for a Supporting Actor Oscar should be in the works now. And let me not forget Uma. She seemed more a killin' machine in 1, but she's best as a conflicted mother in 2, and some of the best work of her career rests in the film's climactic scene that will shock you not because it's violent (it's not), but because it's perfect. Tarantino's dialogue drives the point of the movie home with expert precision, and you might even feel a little choked up. Choked up? In the crying sense? In a Tarantino movie? I told you he'd surprise you.",1084665600,4,5137,4.873997709049255
1418007,5,B00005AQ65,"Yes I am an unabashed, unafraid, and unadulterated admirer of Tarantino. So I realize that my opinion on this movie is very biased. And ya know what I'm not going to attempt objectivity. I'm going to wallow in an orgy of "" euphoric"" praise for this film, which is pretty much what QT does when it comes to the spaghetti western. Where as Kill Bill vol. 1 has the Asian feel with slight nods to Italian westerns, vol. 2 is just the opposite.
  From the operatic, melodramatic, moments in dialogue, to the long soulful closeups. The music (some scored by by fellow travler Robert Rodriquez, some taken from Morricone's score of the Good,the Bad, and the Ugly) is over the top western/mexican, mariachi. And of course the setting is mostly southwestern Texas,and northern Mexican desert. One certainly feels the influence of Corbbuci, and Leone.
  The Asian ""Shaw Brothers"" nod comes in the form of Pai Mai a character from many kung -fu films. Here we get good humor and some very important plot points.
  QT's black/comicbook humor is riddled throughout as it is in most of his work, but here we also have some rather tender moments which actually took me by surprise, pleasent surprise. Despite what some have said, I found these characters rich and well fleshed out especially Uma Thurmans ""Bride"", and Michael Madsens ""Bud"". Madsens performance is probably one of his best with some nice layers for us to sort through, do we feel sorry for him, or do we want him dead? Its moments like this that help make KBV2 so engaging. QT lays out a plethora of emotions with these characters, grief, fear, love, regret, resentment, admiration and joy, yes, joy, its all here.
  As far as film technique goes there is one scene that stands head and shoulders above much of what has been on the screen in the last twenty years. ""The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz"". In my opinion....groundbreaking.
  There are plenty of great camara moves, and some great action. Not as much action as the first, but plenty to satisfy me and mine.

Snappy plot, clever dialogue and great visuals, what more do you need from a good movie? That is why I was so eager to see the second one in theaters.
Boy, was I disappointed. Halfway through I couldn't believe I still had to sit there another hour through this pointless and meandering drivel. After almost every scene you found yourself thinking, ""What did that have to do with anything?"" other than, of course, to give QT a mouthpiece on his particular views (the Superman speech for example). Vol 1 and 2 should have been one, 3 hour, awesome movie with the right mix of dialogue and action. Split into two you ended up with one almost pure action and one almost pure boredom. What a pity!",1084320000,4,897,4.54320987654321
1418009,3,B00005AQ65,"Note: If you haven't seen the film I suggest you read this review after you have.
Let me begin by saying I enjoyed the film. But I was really disappointed by it.
After seeing KBv1 on DVD, I was very much looking forward to seeing the second installment of this two part film. But except for the fact that Bill is indeed killed the second film didn't contain the payoffs I was looking for.
When I first heard of the film simply named ""Kill Bill"" and then realized that the full title included a Volume 1 tag, I knew going in that this film was made with the sequel in mind if not made simultaneously. So I expected the two films to kinda be one really long one a la Lord of the Rings. But I felt like Tarantino spent all his energy on Vol 1 and just seemed to end the story in Vol 2.
Volume 1 started fast, roared through with many different styles, and finished feverishly. I expected Volume 2 to at least do the same if not surpass the masterpiece of film making that Volume 1 is.
I have five major issues with this film:
One, I expected at least another great fight scene, but in Vol 2 there is really only one and while it was pretty good, it was only an one on one confrontation. Couldn't Budd, Elle, or Bill have a few henchmen or students for Uma to kill? But I must admit how the trailer scene ended was priceless.
Two, What happened to the Death List. We saw it prominently in Vol 1. First when Vernita Green's name was crossed off and we find O-Ren's name already crossed off. Then later we see her cross off O-Ren's name. And at the end of Vol 1 we see her make the list. In Vol 2 no list! (I'm not going to nit pick about the fact that The Bride didn't kill Budd or Elle, Maybe that's why they didn't show the list.)
Three, I loved the Anime in Vol 1. It spent a lot of time on O-Ren. Couldn't we have seen something on Vernita Green, or Elle Driver, or maybe even Bill in part 2? Nothing.
Four, seeing the wedding rehearsal was good, although I think they could have done more with it (maybe in Anime). I felt cheated when in a film as violent as this one is the massacre was not shown.
And finally, what was the big deal about not revealing The Brides' name then revealing it. I was looking for some special meaning in the name. I found my self saying ""so what..."" once they revealed it.
The good parts of the film include the bride's training and her getting out of the fix that Budd put her in. And the best part was the end when The Bride finds Bill. This was as intense a series of scenes as I have ever seen. I didn't know what was going to happen and I was on the edge of my seat.
While I recommend this film it is with a caveat. Don't expect it to be as good as the first one.",1084320000,3,2696,4.050561797752809
1418010,5,B00005AQ65,"I think anyone who can not appreciate the merits of Kill Bill has no right to call themself a film lover, and certainly no right to an opinion of any validity.  The crux of the movies is that part two is utterly neccessary to warrant part one.  Anyone who liked the first movie but not the second has missed the point of both and is clearly nothing more than a lover of juvenile action movies.  Kill Bill vol. 2 makes clear the tragically unstoppable process that is honour and revenge.  Part 2 injects some compassion into an otherwise meaningless spree of killing.  All of you one star reviews need to see the film again, but make sure to use your brain this time.",1084320000,4,666,4.382113821138211
1418011,5,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill volume 1"" was a thrilling, intense, stylized, gory bloodbath with occasional poignant moments of character development and backstory. We saw the Bride in full-on revenge mode, hacking to pieces anyone who got in the way of her killing the assassins that turned her wedding rehearsal into a massacre. What we have with ""Kill Bill volume 2"" is actually a perfect yin to volume 1's yang: A poignant, character-driven, dialogue-heavy story with occasional moments of intense, stylized violence. In Volume 2, the focus is on the Bride's complex relationship with Bill, who was her mentor, lover, father figure and would-be killer. We come to understand the reasons why the Bride left the DiVAS to marry a record store owner, and what drove Bill to murder his former lover and protege. As with the last film, Uma Thurman handles every scene and scenario with incredible skill, poise and understated brilliance. David Carradine also gives a terrific performance as the charismatically evil Bill. Props to Tarantino for not just splitting one film in two, but actually creating two distinctly different films that complement and complete each other.",1084233600,,1152,5.198924731182796
1418012,5,B00005AQ65,"I enjoyed Kill Bill volume 2, not just for its flashy action sequences and cheesy kung-fu movie style humor, but for the way it made me think after I left the theatre. Volume 1, according to my opinion, was characterized by its refusal to objectify the female lead, Uma Thurman, and instead molded her into a feminine/warrior hybrid. She was the bride that was beaten and took advantage of, yet once she awoke and realized her unborn baby was gone and probably dead, she vowed bloody revenge on her attackers. Yes, she did cry, but instead of wallowing in a pool of tears like the stereotypical female in Hollywood cinema, she took action. And unlike other female action heroes, she did not wear especially revealing clothing, showed no cleavage, and relentlessly fought against both other women and the patriarchy at large (Bill). But in this movie, we see the bride exhibiting maternal love and giving up her life of murder once again for a family. The end credits call her ""Mommy""--this clearly shows that, no matter how well Uma wields the phallus (samurai sword), she will end up back in her traditional role as mother in the end. This message is confusing, because I saw the first volume as a female-liberation film. But although Tarrantino's message is unclear and perhaps a bit conservative, the settings, characters, music, and especially dialogue were all excellent. Everything flowed very well together and produced a thought-provoking, if not patronizing, film.",1084147200,3,1473,4.991869918699187

The first one was great! It had amazing action and this pop art attitude about it. Now the second one didn't have anything new to offer. It was long and overdone...
The only memorable parts were the few fight scenes and Black Mamba's training... And the fight scenes don't compare to V1's fight scenes... Therefore it had nothing to offer. The story isn't good enough to live on it's own, and if the little action in the second didn't compare to the first then why give it anything more than a 1? Anyone who hasn't seen it yet, the final fight sucks!!! Tarantino leads you up to this big showdown you've been waiting for... And the fight lasts for like 2 minutes...

1418014,4,B00005AQ65,"While I think the Kill Bill series is a bit hyped up, I really enjoyed the second installment and the way the two volumes came together. Quentin Tarantino is quintessential classy-cool, and with films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, has become a highly credited filmaker. While his reputation is bold and far-reaching, it is distinguished and above the mainstream spectrum. People tend to get slightly overexcited when they are introduced to this more exclusive breed of movie; a breed that requires a more acute perception to grasp its meaning. Well I think that Kill Bill was a good movie- it was gripping, funny and bold. But it wasn't purebred Tarantino. Watch it. You will probably enjoy it.

1418015,5,B00005AQ65,"While I found Kill Bill Part One to be a bit callow (although well-done), Kill Bill 2 is an absolutely magnificent piece of cinema that simply blew me away!
A wholesome fusion of stunning visuals, carefully selected soundtrack, and the energy of super-crisp dialogue -- in a sharp, clever, suspenseful lovestory. Yes, this one is not just a cross-national blood fest but a saga of love gone awry, in a very Tarantino sort of a way.
Only Tarantino knows how to draw on a variety of cinematic tropes for a film's look and feel and perhaps the co-opted muscle of certain borrowed sources -- his film wouldn't be one without at least some of his encyclopedic video-geekiness finding its way onto the screen. Yet, it feels VERY inspired and original.
What's most admirable is how we come to feel for each and every character in his films. Even in this tale of otherwise spiteful revenge, the question of who was ""wrong"" is not cut and dry. Was it The Bride who deserved her revenge? This version presents a face on Bill that'll make you think twice about simple inferences from the last movie.
I couldn't recommend watching this opus enough. On the big screen if possible, although I'll be queueing up  for the DVD when it's released. Marvellous!",1084060800,20,1241,4.692660550458716
1418016,4,B00005AQ65,"""Kill bill 2"" was as good as the first, in different ways of course, seeing as this was the talking side of the film, a LOT of talking while the first had a lot more action.
""Bill"", played by the lispy David Carradine, talks a lot. he's some sort of philosophical nut that just doesn't know when to be quiet, and even though I did like this movie a lot, all that bantering made the film drag a bit.
The acting overall was outstanding, brilliant, and just plain wonderful!  It is such a great group of actors that I loved seeing on screen together. The chemistry was amazing.
Like other works of QT's, this movie tends to go back and forth in time, it has to for it all to gel together and make sense.  Maybe that won't make sense to some of you reading my review.  The backstory of ""Bride"" helped me to see the movie in a whole new light.  A big bright light at that.
Another thing I really liked was the character names. Quentin T., who I think is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time, is so creative. And even if it is hard to be completely original in Hollywood, he comes pretty darn close to perfection there.  He is a true master at film making. He surely knows how to put on a good show for his fans

Volume one was action packed wich was cool, but this one was more based on dialouge which is QT's specialty. There is not as much action as the first one but when you think about it none of tarantinos films have much violence in them. Sure dogs had violence in it as well as fiction but there was barely any scenes in them just like KBv2. Overall this is a fantastic film when you combine both volumes it makes one hell of a film.  This is one of the best sequals in awhile(unlike those disapointments tthat were the matrix series, seriousley I've seen better crap in my toilet.) and i can not wait for Tarantinos next film, Inglorious bastards.

1418019,5,B00005AQ65,"Practically everybody who saw ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" last year was blown away by it - at least, those who weren't revolted by the frequent limb-severings, and why were those people seeing a Tarantino flick anyways?  Even if most or all of the references went over your head, it kicked along as an action flick in its own right.  And if you got every last nuance, so much the better - most genre dorks I've talked to agree that it wasn't just rote scene-copying, but respectful and contextually sound ""homage.""  Speaking from my lowly position of ignorance (""Kung-Fu"" and the rest were before my time), I can only say I had a good time.

Of course, ""Kill Bill"" was originally conceived as a single movie, but Tarantino & Co. found it impossible to whittle the massive amount of material down to a reasonable 2 or 3 hours.  Rather than editing all sense out of it, they wisely broke it up into 2 ""volumes.""  The chronology was rather crunchy in Vol. 1, jumping back and forth in time between duels and backstory, but leaving off with our protagonist The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo, alias Black Mamba, a.k.a. Arlene Machiavelli, etc etc) halfway through her death list and on her way to finish it off.  Vol. 2 actually begins at the beginning, with a full account of the wedding chapel massacre briefly glimpsed in 1.  We get to learn a little about Bill's motives in attempting to slaughter his former protege, pregnant with his child yet marrying another man.  But since we've already seen how she miraculously survived, recovered, and immediately initiated a counter-campaign of revenge for what she believes is the lost life of her daughter, we're then shot ahead in time once more to arrive at the next unlucky item on the list: Bill's brother Budd.  From that point on the sequence of events is relatively straightforward, although we get some long flashback sequences as Beatrix reminisces on her earlier training under the venerable master Pei Mei.

It ought to go without saying, but Uma Thurman is absolutely amazing in these films.  She is perhaps the most likable hot-blooded assassin ever to grace the screen, and she always knows exactly how to pitch it.  This film does NOT take place in any world I've ever inhabited (and I've been to Tokyo and Texas, lol), but Uma's performance, supported by that of every other actor in the film, makes it seem real in its bits and pieces.  The way she arrives at a particular situation may defy every common-sense objection, the way she handles it may imply she's superhuman, but her all-too-human emotional reactions hit home in spite of everything.  You can understand her pain, and you can equally enjoy the way she uses it as a flimsy excuse to cleave limbs and pluck out eyeballs.

Michael Madsen likewise hits the nail on the head with Budd, a typically Quentinian trailer trash archetype (cowboy hat, wife beater, the inevitable ""chaw,"" cleans toilets at a topless joint, the whole nine), and Darryl Hannah returns in her surprisingly nimble portrayal of Elle Driver.  And if David Carradine as Bill was practically absent from Vol. 1, you won't miss him in 2.  His scenes with Uma - in which, as with the rest of 2 generally, there is a lot more conversation than katana-clashing - are the real meat of the film as a whole.  The basic philosophical dilemma of vengeance is explored without over-philosophizing it, and the thin line between love and hate is tread right up to the final minute.  Had these not been first-rate actors, and the perfect first-rate actors for these parts, they could never have pulled it off.

Not to make it sound like Vol. 2 is all emoting and flavored coffee.  When the action needs to happen, it happens in a big way, and the fighting scenes in both these films are short (with the exception of blue leaves) but extremely sweet.  Again, there are tons of references that I don't really get, but they're entertaining in their own right - e.g. obviously Pei Mei is a valentine to Kung Fu flicks I've never seen, but it's totally hilarious anyway.  This is one of those films that you want to go see when it first opens, so you can sit in the packed theatre and listen to the way everybody reacts to it for the first time.  ""Kill Bill"" in its entirety is just a lot of fun - enough said.  Go see it!  And Quentin better do a commentary when he releases the deluxe 2-disc boxed set.",1083888000,5,4357,4.631989596879063

So don't get me wrong, but i don't get star struck by my fav directors, i can still tell a good apart from a crap one....And Kill Bill 2 isn't far off that. I'D RATHER WATCH JACKY BROWN. (I know a lot of you's suck Q's dick, but im just sayin, for an action movie, this sucks, okay for a drama, its alright, but Tarantino can do waaay better dialogue. You just cant admit it, & youll probably click ""not helpful!!"" HA! HA!)
I was so pissed off at the cinemas on what had the potential to be one of the greatest films ive seen. I know tarantino trademark is witty & ""im cool"" dialogue, but it just didn't work in Kill Bill 2. It tried too hard to be like Pulp Fiction, & failed. Kill Bill is a lie! False advertisement, promotional posters saying ""THE BRIDE IS BACK FOR THE FINAL CUT!"" What cut? Kill Bill 2 isn't even an action movie, it turns into a dam drama film, which wouldve been fine had it have been another film. Or cut down the unnecessary scenes & made it one f@!#en shorter movie. And even then, because of the anti-climatic battle with Bill (witch lasts roughly 4 seconds!!), this movie suffers. Vol 1 started out as what was sure to be an amazing vol 2...but...sadly...no! Fair enough, we get story, emotions, drama e.t.c Theres hardly any action which is bulls@#t! Vol 2 is a marketing ploy.
I was givin it a chance all the way to the end b4 i judge it, cuz i hoped the battle with Bill it would save the movie...It couldve. Cuz there are some great scenes from the film, but it didnt. DIDNT! Bill was cool, but he ended up bieng all talk & no action, just like the movie, ALL TALK & NO ACTION! Leave that to Pulp & Dogs. Not Kill Bill! I thought this would be unique.
Im not angry, im just sad that Quentin Tarantino, one of my fav directors of all time has let me down so much.
What were u thinkin Q? Love story? Fair enough. But why is there a sword still in the posters? Theres like 2 mins of swordplay.
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED! Vol 1 unique & stylish. Vol 2 slow drawn out. Your Quentin, not Sergio Leone dude! I really wated to love this film, maybe if i saw it again from a different P.O.V id find something to like, but for now, im watchin the Matrix trilogy (& Kill Bill Vol 1!!!)

There are great new characters (most notably Pei Mei) and it does a great job of filling in the holes that were left in Vol. 1(like Uma's screen name).  Memorable scenes would be Uma Thurman being buried alive and her fight with Elle Driver in the trailer home.  Easily one of the best fight scenes ever.  Then there's Bill, played by David Carradine.  He was probably the most engaging character in the whole movie.  While I was disappointed in the way he died, it totally made sense.  Overall, Kill Bill Vol. 2 definitely meets all expectations with its great dialogue and awesome fight scenes.  Be warned though, the fight scenes aren't as fast and furious as the first movie.  Nor are there as many.  But that's not bad because it plays to Tarantino's strength: dialogue.  If you liked Vol. 1 or if you're into karate flicks, you'll love Vol. 2.  But if you didn't like Vol. 1, you'll like Vol. 2 even less.",1083715200,,1311,4.418410041841004
1418023,2,B00005AQ65,"I can only wonder...First we get Kill Bill 1, which was simply a flashier version of 70's karate flicks with loadsa fake blood and gore for extra effect, and then when we're supposed to see the whole plot come theoretically together in Kill Bill 2, we get a film that drags itself painfully for 2.5 hours and bores you to tears.
  Remember, this is Tarantino we're talking about, the director who with brilliant dialogues in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, not only established himself but recreated a stale genre from scratch. But, speaking of dialogues, it's been a long while since I've seen a film with more inane and ultraboring dialogues as in Kill Bill 2.
  Supposedly, once the ""Bride"", finally gets to ""Bill"" we should have the set-up for a tremendous climax. Instead, Bill and Uma sit it out, and start chatting merrily away, making us witnesses of a conversation equal in interest to early hours political talk shows. Tarantino attempts to put together a plot that has twists (ohhhhh, so Bill was Uma's ex!!! wow, how unbelievably interesting) but those ""twists"" would make even sophomore script writers fall asleep.
  And as for climax??? After Uma has gone through of hordes of kung-fu chopping thugs in Kill Bill 1, she finally meets the ""Man"", the ""Boss"", and what do we get? She puts him away with the ridiculous  ""5 finger palm technique""? Mercy, mercy me..
  Alltogether, the ending of KB2, and specifically the last 30-40 minutes of it, has got to be one of the cheesiest, boringiest and draggiest endings i've seen in a long while. I was begging for the film to end no matter how. I was even more begging for them to stop talking the utter nonsense coming out both the characters' mouths...But my prares were answered...
  Before that, there was the momumental fight between Uma and Hanna, which served as one major highlight of the film and the other character, the Chinese kung fu master who was probably the most original character in both installments. But he only got (bizzarely) only 10 minutes of presence in the film, only to give his place to mega-bore Bill.
  Then there was the sequence with Uma digging herself out of 10 feet of dirt if not more. We are shown a  guy, who even uses a ladder (!!!) to climb out of the grave he's dug for Uma, and yet Uma, oh wonders, not only punches her way out of the coffin, but needs no assistance climbing out, because, oh wonders again, the grave has now become miraculously shallower????????? Puhlease....
  Such incredible plot jokes, were also in abundance in KB1, so i wasn't very much surprised to see Tarantino butchering his own script in the second part.
  But when it comes to surprises, i'll say this: i went to see the Kill Bill films very positively biased, being both a massive fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, both of which i consider classic films. But i kept in mind, that the last 2 films Tarantino offered us, were the highly forgettable ""Jackie Brown"" (yeah, anyone remember STILL that one? of course not) and the only at-moments-good but otherwise also forgettable ""Four Rooms"". And i wondered whether with ""Kill Bill"" Tarantino would shine again.
  I was dissapointed. Not so much becuase i didn't like the Kill Bill"" flicks, but because I'm now heavily suspecting that Tarantino might never deliver a film of the high caliber of the 'Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And that is even sadder than the fact that Kill Bill was overall golden mediocrity with a ton of hype.",1083628800,8,3459,4.704809286898839
1418024,4,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino is a great director. For those who love him, you've fallen in love with his style, his amazing dialogue, his INCREDIBLE Shots, and his ability to use actors to completely become the characters he wants them to become. His previous films are fantastic. Reservoir Dogs is a great classic, Pulp Fiction redefined the way people view films, Jackie Brown was a dissappointment to some, but loved by die hard QT fans, and Kill Bill was his come back after 6 years.
I saw Kill Bill on the strength of the director, and Uma Thurman. But unlike some QT fans, i don't believe a film is amazing just because he directed it. And to those who hate QT and think he steals his material, stop hating.
I won't defend QT by saying he ""borrows"" from other films. I think he is an amazing story teller. Even if he borrows or steals from other films, hes stealing all the good stuff from different movies ( no doubt hes seen millions of films-- he used to be a video store geek).
QT figures, why not steal or borrow, all the scenes he loves from the millions of movies he has seen, add his witty dialogue that many seem to love, including myself-- and create my own movie.
I see nothing wrong with this. I think this man has a talent.
Kill Bill Volume, as some review had stated earlier, has moments of vintage tarrantino. The directing and cinematography is absolutely amazing. He has a talent with that camera thats unparallel i swear it! He knows what to shoot, when to shoot it and what the absolute perfect angle is.
I loved Kill Bill volume 1. True, the plot wasn't so deep but this is the action part of his 2 films. THe Hong Kong tribute if u will.
Volume 2 was his spaghetti western tribute (even though i hate this term for some reason)
I love QT's films, and my reviews will always be biased. The problem i had with this second installment was the strected out dialogue. Gorgeous films, great scenes (i won't spoil anything) but the dialogue with Bill was too much. NO I DID GET IT!
it was just too much.. NOOOO I know it was necessary. QT fans are thinking ""ahh he just didn't get it!, it was vital and sooo interesting! yes i agree it was vital to plot and understanding everything. But QT's dialogue in Reservoir dogs was great, pulp fiction was AMazing, Jackie Brown was a bit too much, and Kill Bill he stretched it some more. I love his dialogue, but i couldn't believe as big of a fan as i was, i found myself saying this is too much! I enjoyed the film very much, and so far i have seen it twice because i love this mans work.
When there is too much dialogue, interesting and important or not, you have to go to the editing room. QT cut some great dialogue scenes from Pulp Fiction because even though he knew they were great, it was necessary to leave them out. As a whole these two films are beautiful, and i don't care if they will come out with a dvd special edition crap that will cause fans to spend even more money. (i only buy multiples of films I reallly love) I LOVE KILL BILL AND ALL QT MOVIES. DONT GET ME WRONG.
BUT....... The Dialogue again, QT is in love with his dialogue, as am I. But he should have realized, too much is too much even for die hard fans.
Perhaps in time, as has happened with Pulp Fiction and his other movies, i will hate myself for saying too much dialogue and fall in love even more with this film. Or in the 2010's, i might say, -- they don't make films like kill bill anymore. I always liked QT's films. All of them. i own them all (only the ones he has directed are considered his films). i cant wait for this dvd. I hate theatres and like all films (except for huge summer block buster big budget action destruction special effects films) i need to watch this in my basement with the lights off, surround sound, a little puff puff and to be left alone.
God Bless QT, you entertain me as always, and never cease to amaze me. KILL BILL- not a flavor of the moment. Destined to become a classic, vintage, cult film.",1083542400,,3969,4.293333333333333
1418025,5,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill, Vol 2"" is suffused with the amber light of fondly recalled memory and its tone is as far removed from Vol 1 as the light is from the dark.
Vol 1 was fun, extremely violent in a cartoony way: it was all about making an effect for effects sake and almost nothing to do with humanity and the truth. Vol 2 is slower, more reflective. Tarantino has more up his sleeve here, as it were: for he is dealing with loss, relationships and the redemptive power of Love. Vol 1 is his ""Macbeth,"" Vol 2 is his ""Hamlet.""
And whereas all the violence in Vol 1 is there for it's shock effect, it is never evocative of anything real, Vol 2 's is there only to the clear the way for the final denouement: the Clash of the Titans between Beatrix (Uma Thurman) and Bill (David Carradine).
Uma Thurman physically and emotionally dominates these films as almost no actor has done within recent memory: these performances pack an emotional wallop equal to that of Naomi Watts in last years ""21 Grams"" or Jennifer Connolly in ""The House of Sand and Fog."" Thurman has almost always been excellent in anything that she has done but here her innate intelligence and sly humor keep Beatrix afloat despite the sometimes-sinkable nature of her surroundings.
""Kill Bill, Vol 2"" is a first class entertainment: one that is both thrilling on an action level and yet emotionally open and available.",1083456000,5,1374,4.566801619433198
1418026,4,B00005AQ65,"To my surprise, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is so different from its Vol. 1, although I know they are two non-sepearable parts of ONE story.  It is almost like the exact opposite of Vol. 1, like Yin and Yang of Taichi.  But when they both add together, it makes the whole so complete, so perfect.
Kill Bill Vol. 1 is very violent, gallons of blood, torn apart body parts, Japanese anime, and a little little bit of random story telling.
Kill Bill Vol. 2 is action with more fist fight, more Tarantino-ish dialogue (the Superman theory by Bill), and more acting (esp. for David and Uma).
The two pieces add together to represent ALL the necessary style and elements from Tarantino.
As a fan from Hong Kong, I would like to add that Pai Mei is really talking in Cantonese, and the way the part when Uma was trained under Pai Mei is really the style we Hong Kong film-maker do in 70s - you can check any Bruce Lee films - poor resolution, sudden zoom up to the fact to emphasize the facial expression, etc.  In the cinema in Hong Kong, many many viewers were laughing at this chapter.  Also, the plot about a person training for a special shot (Five Point Palm, etc), training on a hill in front of a master, and go downhill after graduation for revenge is a traditional and classic plot for many many martial art movies and fictions.  This proves Tarantino is a really fan of Hong Kong movies.
A very good movie.....do not miss it.....also wait until the end of credit to see a blooper scene from Vol. 1 about Uma.",1083456000,5,1501,4.365591397849462
1418027,5,B00005AQ65,"In Kill Bill Vol. 1 we saw Quentin Tarantino give us some (...) action. Feeding off of the old kung fu movies and TV shows, he gives rebirth to a genre that has chewed up by recent movies like The Matrix. Despite how well the movie was made, we didn't get too much character development in the first one. We learn who these people are, they're short term goals in certain aspects, and then we see them fight, and the majority of them die in the process.
In Kill Bill Vol. 2 we see what surrounds the action of Vol. 1. We learn more about the characters, where they've been, what they've become, and in the end the journey is well worth the turmoil that we felt with the bride to reach the satisfying end.
The movie opens up with The Bride driving down the road describing to the audience what it's taken for her to get to this point, and her plans in the end: ""I'm going to kill Bill,"" she exclaims at the end of her brief monologue. Then we see what really happened at the fateful massacre. This scene actually surprised me, I didn't expect it to start out as it did, but was still brilliantly played out. From there we meet Bill's brother Bud. He used to be a part of the DiVAS, but had a falling out with Bill, and pawned his Hattori sword and became a trailor trash alcoholic who works as a bouncer at a seedy strip club. Michael Madsen does an awesome job with Bud in this movie. He still has the cool grace of his character from Reservoir Dogs, and still almost the same sadistic presence.
To go too much more into the movie would give a lot of the surprise away to this awe-inspiring movie. Some of the best parts I will say are Bill's monologue stories. Originally, Quentin Tarantino wrote the part of Bill for Warren Beatty, but after reading the script Beatty said that Carradine would be better for the part, and too right he was. Carradine brings a sort of mystic/mysterious quality to the role. As he tells the story of Pei Mei before the bride goes for her kung fu training, we feel almost as though he's an old Cherokee tribe story teller telling an ancient story to his tribe. Every so often he stops to play a beautiful melody on his flute. With his metaphoric speech about Superman, we see him as a New Age/Contemporary story teller, drawing us into his story just so we can here the moral of the story. Bill also comes off as a somewhat likable character that you almost feel sorry for when you here his reasoning behind what he did.
Still, though, Uma Thurman is the scene stealer of this movie. Quentin Tarantino always brings out the best performance out of any actor he works with, but he went beyond that with Uma. You feel her anguish, you cry with her, you fear for her, and you want her to come out on top. There's not much I can say about her that doesn't come across in her scene presence in this 2 part movie.
I've heard a lot of people say that QT should have trimmed this movie to make it into one screening, but in all honesty, making a two part movie was brilliant in it's own right. First off, QT is the type of film maker who gets his vision on the screen the first time, unlike some film makers who come back after years of having the perfect film and add stuff to it. Secondly, the twist at the end of vol. 1 wouldn't have been the same if right in the middle of a one piece movie. Also having it in 2 parts adds to the suspense, not to mention it was an awesome marketing ploy, after Vol. 1 you want to know what happens to the characters, you want development so you want to see Vol. 2.
All in all, I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, although my favorite movie is still Pulp Fiction, I think this two part movie was overall better, and whether you are a QT fan or not, you should see this movie.",1083369600,2,3754,4.222531293463144
1418028,5,B00005AQ65,"Ok please stop saying this is two separate films !! its two seperate installments of the same film as Lord of the Rings is in three segments....note the film has chapters? its meant to read like a book !! so i bought Tarantinos Boxed set of Pulp, Brown and Dogs in a place called ASDA in th Uk owned now by Wallmart (americans *spit*) and found it for 20 thats not bad goin now is it for a limited dition set. Tarantino is a great director..not the best but certainly a good one. Look at all these people drooling over Peter Jackson for LOTR...have you seen his other work? haha or the great gerbil himself George Lucas who has personally destroyed the great name of Star Wars. Tarantino does not follow trends. ok...hes done three gangster films..some mexican themed films ( desperado, dusk till dawn) and now a blinding kung fu. now lets face it none of us in england really know anything by the shaw brothers and the only kung fu we know is karate kid. so having this said where are all the good martial arts films? the good romance revenge films? theres been none since crouching tiger which is a classic in its own right and a work of genius. Kill Bill has shown the world that theres still hope and that Tarantino has not lost it when it comes to writing gritty stories. i think you all hate Vol 2 because you expected more violence...is that what films have to be? Look at Empire strikes back...slow and sluggish but considered the best star wars film by most fans. a story drives emotions not blood and guts and if they do you need to spend less time on video games. "" if i wanted to make a computer game i would have stuck my d**k into my nintendo"" quote from tarantino. get a life you lot and enjoy this classic tale of love and revenge. im rooting for ya Quentin.",1083369600,3,1774,4.33033033033033
1418029,4,B00005AQ65,"I went to see KILL BILL VOL 1 grudgingly at the request of a friend. However, after seeing the film, I was kind of impressed and was curious to see how things would come to together in VOL 2. Well, everything fits together rather nicely and this Volume makes a nice conclusion to what began in the first.
The movie begins with a black and white montage with the Bride talking about what had happened in Volume 1 and about how nothing was going to stop her from her goal to kill Bill. This version is much more story and dialogue driven than the action/violence driven Volume 1. Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker that most people either love or hate. I tend to fall more on the side of hate, simply because he often over emphasizes violence. However, I do think the man is an extremely talented writer as the dialogue in his films is usually extremely witty, bright, and full of substance. Anyway, Volume 2 isn't anywhere near as violent as the first volume and focuses more instead upon character development and the relationships between the chracters. There's really only one new character introduced in this edition (Pai Mei), but he forms a crucial part of the background the Bride's story. There are a view violent scenes (especially between the Bride and Elle Driver), but overall it is dialogue and characterization that drive the picture.
KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is longer and a bit more slow than KILL BILL VOLUME 1. There were a few things that could have been cut to make the film a little shorter, but I guess Tarantino decided to put a little more stuff in to make up for cutting this movie into two separate parts. Other than that, KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a fitting end to this part of the Kill Bill saga. As a sidenote, though, don't be surprised if this is the last we see of The Bride: there was a little incident from the first volume that might lead to another part of the story.",1083283200,,1892,4.455331412103747
1418030,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino has dalzed us from the moment his first film ""Resivoir Dogs"" appeared on the big screen. In between sceens of intense action/violence we are given great dialogue, unforgettable characters, and films that hold our attention. Possible the most intreguing filmmaker since Alfred Hitchcock, or Stanley Kubrick. And like those master filmmakers he never fails to lead us into places others would not, or simply could not go. Kill Bill VOL 1 is a fast paced action film that used the tired revenge cliche, but made it work. Although in VOL 1 the usual Tarantino dialogue is kind of overshadowed it brilliantly sets up VOL 2.
VOL 2 sucks us deeper into the world of the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad."" Here 'The Bride'(Here name will be heard this time, but not until about half-way through) will become more then just some nameless killer. I think Umma Thurman really does a spectacular job here as she is able to make herself appear as a believable assassin. There is no 'superman' invulnerablility here, the hero accomplishes much, but she must bleed for it. Her training with Pei Mei(who is probably the best supporting character in the film) is harsh, and slightly reminiscent of Yoda in ""Empire Strikes Back"", and Jackie Chans training in ""Drunken Master"". Of all the former D.V.A.S. assassins it is Bill's brother Bud who has fallen the lowest, and the most pitiful. Yet with the exception of Bill he is also the most philosphical. He is however in the end still a slimely S.O.B.
Elle Driver played brilliantly by Daryl Hannah who's personal evil is so menancing it is almost impossible not to focus on her. The fight scene between 'Black Momba'aka 'The Bride' and 'California Mountain Snake' aka 'Elle Driver' is the best of either film. This all sets us up for the moment we have been waiting for, the confrontation with BILL. David Carradine's 'Bill' aka 'Snake Charmer' is possibly the perfect villian. Bill is a likeable character who is also in his own words, ""A murdering Bastard.""
The end of the film does not disappoint, and throws us some curves that make the ending emotional, exciting, and leave you craving for more. However there is good news. Tarantino wants to make a third installment in fifteen years or so about the child of Vivica A. Fox character Vernita Green aka Copperhead. As she goes on her own quest of revenge against the 'the bride' for killing her mother. This movie might be longer than VOL 1, but you probably won't notice it. Tarantino pulls you in so well that you enjoy yourself too much to realize you been there longer. This film is simply amazing, and the best Tarantino has ever made.",1083196800,10,2645,4.789934354485776

The worst part is were Uma Thurman is tied up and buried 5 miles under ground. So how she is able to get her feet untided, get a knife, untie her arms, punch her way out of the cofin she was in, and just climb up the 5 miles of dirt. This was the first summer film I have seen and it was bad. I hope Van Helsing, Alien vs. Predator, and Resident Evil 2 are better.",1083196800,6,475,3.808080808080808
1418032,5,B00005AQ65,"At some point, Quentin Tarantino will smush Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 back together to form a three-hour plus grindhouse epic.  Too bad, because Kill Bill Vol. 2 needs no preface.  It needs nothing added to it.  It's a perfect film, on its own, and in many ways it is Tarantino's best film.
It's also the most delightful surprise of Tarantino's brief career.  Both Kill Bill films were shot at the same time, with a single script, as one film.  Yet, the splitting of the film has resulted in two different pieces that differ greatly in quality.  Somehow, Volume 1 contained all the worst of Tarantino - self-indulgence, film geek references no one cares about, no plot, no characters, mind-numbing bloodshed, and so on.  It almost seems like Tarantino needed to get all the excesses of Vol. 1 out before he could go and make the REAL movie.
And that movie is Volume 2 - a delirious, insanely entertaining epic that is perhaps the most visceral film experience you will ever have.  The plot here is more disciplined.  The characters get fleshed out (and occasionally bled out).  There's no fat here - it's all 100% Grade A, US Prime movie spectacle.  You'll laugh, cry, forget to breathe, cringe, gasp, wince, and do everything else short of having a seizure.  Here is Tarantino at his most manipulative, his most masterful.
And, apart from the obvious scenes worth savoring (the Massacre at Two Pines, David Carradine's Bill making his daughter a bologna sandwich, The Bride's pregnancy test, and the Pei Mei sequence), there are little details are even more impressive - Michael Madsen getting chewed out by his strip club manager, a five-minute black screen sequence that has to rank among the most suspenseful scenes in film, and a biology lecture from Daryl Hannah's evil Elle Driver.  All of it is good.  None of it feels self-congratulatory.  How was this made at the same time as its predecessor?
Since Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino has largely been out of the eye of pop culture.  Jackie Brown was too low key, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 seemed to try too hard.  But with Kill Bill Vol. 2, he reasserts himself as an audacious force in moviemaking, the Scorsese of his generation.  He'll spend the coming months turning the two Kill Bills into just one.

After a brief overview to start things off, the film begins to explain the storyline much better than V.1, and it focuses more on developing the Bride's(Uma Thurman) character.(They finally reveal to the audience her name about halfway through)
Towards the end of the film, you can tell that the series was not as much stylized revenge samurai feature as it was an oddball romance between assassins.  If you liked the first one, then you definately have to see Volume 2.  Even if you didn't like the first you, Kill Bill Volume 2 will probably be more agreeable to you than the first.

1418038,4,B00005AQ65,"I liked Volume 1, but mainly for the gimmicks and the quirky style. Volume 2 really has the plot and the characters.  You'll probably like it better if you see Vol. 1 first, but I don't think that's absolutely necessary.  This gives much more detail of the important wedding scene and all you'll miss is the Bride's revenge on a number of others who were involved.  Uma is the one who really makes this movie though.  She is given several important scenes which she does to perfection.  The year is young, but this has to be one of the five best performances by an actress in a leading role if it isn't the best.  As she goes her bloody path of revenge, you see brief hints of inner struggle.  And this defines her character and lifts the movie to a higher plateau. There's a lot less blood letting here and that might disappoint those who were caught up in the hyper violence of Volume 1.  But those who place importance on the plot and characterization will be pleased. Not that there aren't violent scenes.  There sure as heck are.  And there are gross out scenes, one in particular.  However, those scenes don't get in the way of the story. Although Uma controls the movie, David Carradine is the perfect Bill and this movie may well put some new life into his career. I don't give it 5 stars, because there are points where it drags a bit, but over all, it's one superb movie.  And I wasn't the only one in the theater who thought so.  This is the first time ever that I watched a movie in a theater that the audience didn't rise to leave after the last scene but stayed seated to watch the reprise of the characters and actors before the rest of the credits started rolling.

1418039,5,B00005AQ65,"Several months ago, eclectic director Quentin Tarantino regaled our senses with a visceral thrill-ride known as ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"".  This first half of Tarantino's epic tale of revenge introduced to the enigmatic former assassin known as the Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) and the circumstances that led her to embark on a quest to `kill Bill'.  Mamba miraculously survived an assassination by Bill and his current hit squad (although her entire wedding party was murdered), only to end up in a coma for four years.  Once she regained consciousness, she began to exact brutal vengeance on those responsible.

In ""Vol. 1"" she took out Vernita Green/""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii/""Cottenmouth"" (Lucy Liu).  The revenge was purely physical and graphically brutal.  It was a veritable assault of visual images and thrilled the audience with the completeness and thoroughness of Mamba's revenge.  Fascinatingly, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is a drastically different film even though it continues the same story.  ""Vol. 2"" takes a more philosophical approach to Mamba's revenge, whereas ""Vol. 1"" was the more physical approach.  While more talkative possessing less action, ""Vol. 2"" is no less effective than ""Vol. 1"".  What ""Vol. 2"" brings is the rest of the story that ""Vol. 1"" rightfully left out.  In this concluding episode, we now know more about the history between Bill and Mamba.  We learn more about why Bill ordered Mamba's assassination.  As an added bonus, after seeing a steely-eyed killing machine in ""Vol. 1"", we get to see a more vulnerable Mamba in this installment.  The combination of the two volumes completes this story.  One is the yin to the other's yang.  The choice to split the film into two parts now not only seems correct, but essential.

Doubts about Tarantino still having `it' should be full dispelled by this incredible cinematic achievement.  ""Kill Bill"" honors martial-arts films of the past while setting a standard for future films to emulate.  ""Kill Bill"" manages to thrill the senses while challenging the mind.  Tarantino showed that he had this talent when he made ""Pulp Fiction"".  ""Kill Bill"" is the next step in the evolution of Tarantino's work.  Where he goes from here is anyone's guess, but it has the potential to be spectacular.",1083024000,23,2280,5.07258064516129
1418040,4,B00005AQ65,"Before watching this movie, I had heard that there wasn't as much action as the first one. Which is fine with me because having watched some of Tarantino's previous films, I know that the outstanding dialog can be worth the admission price alone. The movie started out quite nicely. We finally got to see more of Bill. And the dialog was quite good. Good start. However, the movie seemed to go downhill for me after that. I found that the lack of action really was quite noticeable and the dialog didn't really fill the void. It's almost like these movies were made at different times and it makes me wonder what my impression would've been had I seen the entire thing all at once. So let me just say that I found the 1st part of the movie to be more entertaining, however, the 2nd part has its moments and is still a MUST see for those who have seen Volume 1.",1082937600,4,860,4.314814814814815

1418043,5,B00005AQ65,"First off, I would like to state for the record, because people seem to be having a hard time with this one, that Kill Bill Volume 2 is NOT a sequel.  It is the second half of one absoloutly amazing epic.  One review declared that this movie was nothing but a rip-off of old kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns.  Hello, half the point of this movie is that it is a tribute to all of Tarantino's old favorites, styles and directors, which is clear if you stay through the credits and read the thank yous.  This review had the gall to say that they thought that Uma Thurman wasn't right for the part... Quentin Tarantino WROTE the part for her.  To demean this film by calling it anything less than genius is a flaw that only the ""Steven Segal"" fans of this day could commit.
Uma Thurman positively shone as The Bride, and Daryl Hannah was spectacular as Elle Driver (not to mention the beauty of a little poetic justice), and Michael Madsen was as bad-ass as Michael Madsen always is.  And eloquent would be a severe understatement in describing David Carradine's performance as Bill.  The editing, the banter, the raw emotion worked so well that you will find yourself paying to see this movie more that once.

Many people who don't realize I'm stealing ideas from other great filmmakers will think I'm coming up with these ideas on my own.

1418045,4,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill: Volume 2 is a film entirely separate from Quentin Tarantino's first installment: restrained where the other was excessive; introspective where the other relied on a glossy surface; and character-driven where the other relied on extended fight sequences. Volume 1 was not a bad film, but it was a B-movie, no matter how expertly executed. In Volume 2, Tarantino returns to A-level form, approaching though not reaching the heights of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown. His lightning-fast pacing is back, as is his gift for edgy and funny dialogue. This is an example of a very rare gem: a crowd-pleaser that is also a very good movie.
The Bride (Uma Thurman) has already killed dozens upon dozens of evildoers as the film begins. Still left on her handy checklist of death are Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and of course Bill (David Carradine). The first sequence transports us back in time to the bloody wedding that never was, making disturbingly clear just why The Bride has murder on her mind. Bill, thanks to a tremendous performance by Carradine, is a fully realized and fascinating character right from the start: at once seemingly wise as he plays a long wooden flute and wraithy, speaking in a whispery hiss.
Madsen and Hannah are both very strong as the last two living members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Budd, in particular, feels doom impending on his desolate trailer home after a meeting with Bill. ""This woman, she deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die,"" he says. But he doesn't plan to give up without a fight, putting The Bride into one of many potentially fatal situations. Elle, still wearing that mysterious eye patch (it is explained), may be the most devious of all. Apparently an expert on snakes, she reads a dissertation on the black mamba as a writhing victim lies dying on the floor.
Besides her Hanzo sword, we also learn why The Bride is such a dangerous combatant. She was trained by Pai Mei, a legendary warrior with a rotten attitude and a long white beard that he flips incessantly. He is also the master of the dreaded Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. This maneuver consists of a blow to the chest that, upon his walking just five steps, makes the receiver's heart explode. This mid-movie, 20-minute sequence might be the highlight, blending comedy with the mystical back-story we crave. Pai Mei is hilarious, Tarantino's campy love letter to every cantankerous teacher known to kung fu cinema. And, it is not giving away too much to mention that the Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique plays a big role in the film's finale--the most flawless 30 seconds of artistry seen this year.
Apart from Pai Mei, there are numerous top-notch sequences in Kill Bill: Volume 2 where it is readily apparent one is watching the work of a master filmmaker. In one case, The Bride is buried alive. We feel as though we're trapped inside that coffin with her, as the rumble of dirt crashing onto the lid echoes through the darkened cinema. The best fight sequence in the film, maybe even both films, comes during the final confrontation between The Bride and Elle. It is short and intense, never losing the audience's full attention (as the endless culminating fight eventually did in Volume 1), and wraps up with a single moment that had the whole theatre cheering. Such an accomplishment cannot be overstated, since Elle is really a peripheral character.
Overlength is the single factor that mars this film, which in a way is totally unexpected. Some of Tarantino's very best work runs about 150 minutes, and every second is worthwhile. Here, running about 135 minutes, the climax is nearly 40 minutes long and really feels protracted. Perhaps this does reflect some weakness in The Bride and Bill as characters, since it would be enjoyable to listen to Jackie Brown, Max Cherry or Jules Winnfield converse all day long. The dialogue between them here is strong, and it is hard to even pinpoint what deserves to be cut, but the breakneck pace really screeches to a halt right when excitement should be hitting a crescendo.
Nevertheless, take five, ten, or 15 steps to see Kill Bill: Volume 2. It's is a Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique caliber rush of pure adrenaline and fun.

Disappointment may find you completely. Vol. 2 really means to complete the whole story of Kill Bill. Actions? Yes, but not as non-stop and fancy as the first one. The Kill Bill movie shouldn't be splitted into two volumes. They really should be watched together.
About the Kill Bill2 movie, inspite of the less actions, it's still very carefully well-planned as Tarantino's usual style. There're lots of hints and signs to the critical parts of the storyline, like the Black Mamba, Pai Mei's story, and especially the 5-points palm exploding heart technique, which becomes the surprised gift to Bill. Among all my friends, most of them found it quite disappointed. But if you watched the Vol. 1 DVD just before going to Vol. 2, and you think from a unified story perspective, you should find this KillBill2 is pretty good.",1082764800,2,968,4.837349397590361

1418048,2,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill is an undisciplined, self-indulgent mess.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A whirlwind of chaos can be amusing, or even thrilling.  Unfortunately, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more like a mess you'd find in the closet of a guy who lives in a basement apartment in his mother's house; a guy who smokes too much weed, or dropped too much acid in high school.  It's the boring fantasy of a guy who is way less smart than he fancies himself, and who has allowing his head to be swollen, and his creativity to be drained, by narcissistic excess.
It's easy to see how Hollywood would gather around this muddy tripe.  After all, Quetin's a ""genius,"" and how could something so incoherent be anything less than progressive gold?  Sorry, folks, but the Emperor's got no clothes.
The only redeeming parts of this movie involve scenes where Uma Thurman learns martial arts from a guy who jumped straight out of a video game, and who spouts mangled midwestern versions of zen wisdom.

1418049,5,B00005AQ65,"I saw ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" in the theater the day it came out, and was impressed with it as much as I was with Vol. 1 - in many ways, for different reasons.  I had heard that Tarantino had made part 2 the love story, focusing less on action and violence, and was curious as to how he did it.
In one word: Brilliantly.  Uma Thurman continues her quest for revenge as The Bride/Black Mamba, now with 3 targets left on her hit list: Budd (Bill's brother/Sidewinder), Elle (California Mountain Snake), and Bill (Snake Charmer) himself.  How she does it can't even be explained, but it's incredible to watch -- and this poor woman goes through hell in trying to accomplish her goal (whether she does so or not ... see the movie).  NEVER have I seen a film where the main character went through this much to get what she wants -- and you hope she gets it.  The main action is intercut with flashbacks of The Bride getting her martial arts training from Master Pai Mei (some of the best, most rousing, and funniest scenes in the film), and part 2 deals much more in characters development, also the love story between Bill and The Bride -- which went horribly, horribly wrong.
With so damn much build up, most directors would easily fail to live up to what they set up in the conclusion.  Not the case here, as the film ends unexpectedly but in a very satisfying way.
The performances are top-quality, and Uma Thurman's Bride deserves her place in the annals of American movie heroines.  David Carradine, Michael Madsen, and Daryl Hannah all give outstanding performances, and together the two films form a complete movie that has everything - action, romance, violence, humor, thrills -- you name it.  I stayed throught the end credits, where (as a former actor) I gained true respect for Tarantino, who appreciates actors so much he gave every performer -- even actors with the smallest roles -- their own screen time by spotlighing them individually during the credits (he also made them humorous - definitely don't leave until they're completely over).
As I said in my review of the first film, these movies are an EXPERIENCE to be seen, and should NOT have been edited to one really long film, as has been suggested.  How retarded is that, when not one frame of film was was wasted on either.
When Tarantino releases this one on DVD, hopefully he will release the two as a package, with tons of extras and some great commentaries.  For now, these are two masterpieces by a man who knew his vision - and made it 100% real.",1082764800,10,2517,4.548672566371682
1418050,5,B00005AQ65,"KILL BILL: VOL. 1 surpassed my highest expectations.  Being the Big Q.T.'s first sequel, I wasn't sure how KILL BILL: VOL. 2 would turn out.  Why would I even worry?  With Q.T. at the reins, there's no way KB2 was gonna suck.
The film, naturally, begins with Chapter Six, entitled ""Massacre at Two Pines"".  It deals with the events that took place before the event that left The Bride (Uma Thurman) a widow.  By the way, we do learn her name by the end of the film - but, just to keep you happy, I won't tell ya.  After this segment, and a 50's-style intro by The Bride herself, we pick up where the first film left off - with three more names on her list - retired redneck Budd (a.k.a. Sidewinder - Michael Madsen), treacherous and skilled beauty Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake - Daryl Hannah), and the big man himself: Bill (a.k.a. Snake Charmer - David Carradine).  There really isn't much of a story to give away - The Bride's still looking for satisfaction, on her rampage, bla-bla-bla.
KB2 may be even more campy than the first film.  It certainly features more references to other films, particularly the Shaw Bros. pics of the 70's (which starred Gordon Liu, who plays kung-fu master Pai Mei).  It is, like the first film, completely entertaining, and - more than once - very funny.  One thing's for sure - if ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and the first ""Kill Bill"" didn't prove it, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" sure does - no one makes films like Quentin Tarantino.",1082678400,3,1483,4.562264150943396
1418051,5,B00005AQ65,"I have just come back from seeing Kill Bill 2... and i am amazed. The first film, since owning it on weds, has not left my DVD player and has been watched numerous times! I couldn't just watch my favourite bits... i had to watch twenty minutes extra before i realised i really must be doing something else!
The 2nd one is MUCH less bloody - no mass killings like the Crazy 88! There is more emotion, a lot more dialogue and a lot more depth into the characters.
That in no way means that Kill Bill 2 sucks cos it has no action... it is fantastic. It is completly different in that it handles the death of the characters a lot more slow paced, making you really feel the brides pain and agony of what she has been through. Tarentino plays with humerous mixed in with complete emotional dialogue - and the moment she meets Bill was completly different to how i pictured it. I imagined two professional sword fighters wrecking eachother to pieces - but no. Instead we had pure emotion - and you're left feeling... can i say it... slightly sympathetic for Bill! I nearly cried!!! But at the end you can truely see that all the agony it took to kill him - The Bride is happy to get her revenge.
Budd is a fantastic character - the poor loser in the caravan who completly shocks us in how he treats the bride. I'm not claustrophobic myself but the scenes with the bride in the coffin, buried alive made me feel confined and scared!!!
Elle Driver is another fab one - complete cool nasty chick! And that fight scene is incredible - although beware snake fearers! (my mate was wriggling in her chair!)
Overall, the film amazed me - it completly did not disapoint me. Tarentinos humour (just the beard stroking had me in hysterics), his use of black and white, his use of music (that made the 1st one for me... the rock n roll music whilst the bride teddy bear rolls and slices limbs off the crazy 88's... genious!)
I cant wait to see the whole 4 and a half hour film... i imagine it will need a bit of editing just to make it fit just right, but i'm sure its actually the two parts that were edited to make it cliff hang and work better as two parts... so who knows.
I hope you enjoy the film as much as i have - this is my favourite tarentino.",1082678400,4,2236,4.251173708920188

Along the way, we get flashbacks of her training and the wedding massacre that would set her on her course of revenge.  This is a better movie than Volume 1, focusing more on characters than action.  Volume 2 is also a (marginally) better film than Volume 1.  It can stand on its own, and feels more like a Tarantino film, despite being essentially a love story.  To me, David Carradine was the scene stealer as the titular Bill.  Whereas in Volume 1, he was a mysterious figure, he is probably the most developed character in Volume 2.  Tarantino has made two interesting films that really could have been shortened down into one that might have been better than the sum of its parts.",1082678400,2,845,4.624161073825503

The rest of the movie is, partly excelent, dialog, but that's about it.
The dialogs, as funny as they somtimes appear, are mostly pointless and most of the scenes (as somebody else already pointed out) shoudl've stayed on the cutting room floor.
Quentin Tarantino should've been insisting on the original plan, to make just ONE movie with 3-3.5 hours length instead of making 2 movies which add up to more than 4 hours.
If there's ever going to be a director's cut, I hope it'll be the first to make an exception to the rule ""DC's are longer than the studio-version"", and be shorter.
After I saw Vol. 1 I wanted to buy that as soon as it would get released.

The best scene (that there is no fighting in) would have to be Bill's speach about Superman.  Also, Budd and Elle have some great dialogue along with the Bride.  Oh yeah, her name is finally revealed, but I didn't understand why it was such a big secret.
This movie is a lot slower paced then Vol. 1.  If you haven't seen Vol. 1 then you will not know what is going on in this movie.  There aren't as many fight scenes in this movie.  But the one fight scene between Thurman and Hannah is definately worth remembering.
This movie was really good.  I personally liked the first one better, mainly because there was a lot more action.  I wish that Samuel L. Jackson would have had a bigger role in Vol. 2, but no everything can go my way.  If you've seen Vol. 1, then definately see Vol. 2.  If not, then you may not want to see this movie.

1418055,5,B00005AQ65,"The announcement that Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" was to be shown in two parts instead of one instigated an evident wave of anxiety amongst fans of the young auteur. Some suspected that it was Harvey ""Miramax"" Weinstein's scheme to gather twice the profit. Others thought that Q.T. overdid himself, and made an overlong motion picture which now had to be extended into two volumes. And EVERYone marveled at the highly uncommon strategy: the release of ""Vol. II"" a couple of months after the first one may have flopped at the box-office... As it turns out, splitting ""Kill Bill"" into two parts was a premeditated move by the film's skillful director Q. Tarantino - as a four-hour spectacle the grand revenge/ exploitation/ samurai saga could have worked perhaps, but ""Kill Bill"" would have surely lost some of its elegance under the weight  of an overwhelming variety of genres that Q.T. juggles. Fans can now breathe easily - the strategy worked. Less violent and action-packed than its successful predecessor, ""Vol. II"" astonishes by delving into more back-story and emotional depth, sustaining the feel of Q.T.'s patent love for cinema. The director often bluntly brags in interviews about his film knowledge. This is Q.T.'s abundant cinematic narcissism, personified.
 ""Vol. I""'s excesses left no room for subtlety. We were too flabbergasted to care. We did wonder whether ""Vol. II"" would keep flabbergasting us with such ruthlessness. We were obviously to remain spectators rather than participants - while hard to relate to, the events in ""Vol. I"" were beautifully made to admire. There is subtlety in ""Vol. II"" - it resonates off the grandiose locations on which the camera lingers, off the pathos of the characters' revealed history, and off a more contemplative - and, in a way, epic - approach. The subtlety is there, but we are still to merely admire instead of mentally partake. It's for the better - there was no way, for a film that ponders on such an epic scale, to embrace its audiences entirely. ""Vol. II"" 's authenticity comes from its devotion to the subjects it pays respect to (including the audience). If ""Vol. I"" was Q.T.'s ""The Wild Bunch"", then ""Vol. II"" is his ""The Searchers"".
Swiftly, ""Kill Bill Vol. II"" `s plot involves: The long-awaited reuniting of Q.T. and Michael Madsen (aka Mr Blonde, the most malicious of ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992)), who plays Budd (aka Sidewinder); despite winning our sympathy, Budd follows Bill's instructions and buries Uma Thurman's Kiddo (aka The Bride, aka Black Mamba) in a coffin under several feet of dirt, with the plan to sell her priceless sword to Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake). In a terrifyingly claustrophobic sequence, Kiddo, trapped in the coffin, has a desperate flashback to her training with master Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu), where she learned to ""make the WOOD afraid of her fist"", and as a result brutally punches her way out. One of the film's highlights, the training scene has humor (marvel at the extreme zoom-ins), sadness (The Bride's willpower devastates), wisdom (in its adequate mythological tone) and style. After a brutal battle with Elle Driver (expect to shriek at one point), Kiddo finally encounters Bill. As played by David Carradine, Bill is not just a simple villain - he is both magnetic and appalling, conceited and affectionate, jealous and proud, with a whole mythology built around him and the resounding flute he plays. The culmination includes a lot of dialogue, and a richly quiet finale.
 ""Vol. I"" made it instantly clear that the film's intelligence was not in 'what' the plot was but 'how' it was. The film - in the vein of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) but much more copiously - excelled at keeping a tone of its own while delighting film geeks with endless homages to Q.T.'s numerous influences, such as Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa and Sonny Chiba (who is in the film himself). The relentless pace, extreme embellishments, dexterous dialogue and evident enthusiasm of the creator made it clear, even for non-aficionados, that ""Kill Bill"" was more than just an action film. If action movies sometimes include sly winks, Q.T.'s ""Kill Bill"", as ""Vol. II"" verifies with its retro-title-credits and score alone, IS an elaborate wink. Will surely become a classic.
PS - Check out Sam Jackson's hilarious cameo as a wedding piano player.
PPS Michael Parks is exceptional as Bill's quirky friend Esteban, a hustler whom Kiddo confronts about Bill's whereabouts.",1082592000,2,4481,5.044534412955466
1418056,5,B00005AQ65,"To anyone wondering whether ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has lived up to the phenomenon Volume 1 created for itself upon its release a year ago, the answer is a definite yes. Not only has it lived up to the expectations from critics and audiences alike, but it has managed to be even better than the first, combining style and substance for a different, but ultimately just as satisfying, cinematic experience.
In some aspects, Volume 2 is more a character study, as we begin to learn the unexpected personalities, histories, and different sides of characters that Volume 1 didn't have time to delve into. Backgrounds of major scenes like the Massacre at Two Pines are established, relationships between characters become more detailed, and the suspense begins to build as we as an audience are ultimately dying to know how the saga will come to a close.
One of the many things that makes ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" great are the performances. As The Bride (you learn her name in this film), Uma Thurman gives a performance worthy of an Oscar, or at least a nomination. The best way I can think of to describe it is realistic, as she experiences a wide range of emotion in her role; pain, terror, anger, sadness, determination, joy, and in each she manages to convey it in a believable and honest way that is truly astounding to watch. David Carradine, as Bill, finally gets the screen time to showcase his talents, all delivered in an terrifying but somehow comforting quiet manner.
In another amazing performance, Michael Madsen (Budd) has the ability to convey emotion with a single look in his eye or on his weathered face. Regret, sadness, but an undeniable, sadistic greed are played subtley and realistically here, and in my opinion, he also deserves a nomination for a supporting role. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is another performance not to be missed. She is truly, maniacally evil here, and seems to relish every moment of it. Also, Chia Hui Liu, as Pai Mei, the Bride's instructor, gives a small but delightful performance, providing a large portion of the humor in the film.
Although ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is more driven by its dialogue than its gory fight scenes, it has its share of amazing matchups, the most astounding (as many reviewers have already said) being that of the confrontation between the Bride and Elle Driver in Budd's sundrenched trailer. It is without a question one of the most amazing sequences I have ever witnessed, and one of my personal favorites in the Kill Bill movies.
The creative direction in this film also deserves much praise. The transitions from black and white to color film adds a new dimension to the picture, and choice of light, intensity of sound, and cinematography, especially in the fight sequences, makes ""Kill Bill"" a visual delight. Blending the spaghetti westerns as a contrast to the old kung-fu flicks was a genius move as well.
A fan of Tarantino's previous works or not, you must give credit where credit is due for the ""Kill Bill"" films. Each piece is essentially a work of art, where style and substance are beautifully combined for an original, humorous, and truly unforgettable experience.",1082592000,3,3139,4.814814814814815

She continues her rampage of revenge and hones in on the target named in the film's title.  The story shifts back and forth in time as we learn more about our heroine's life before the massacre.
Once again director Quentin Tarantino delivers an exciting, action-packed and stylish cinematic triumph.  KB2 is a richly textured film in which every element--music, cinematography, costumes, etc.--unites to create a total cinematic experience.
The film's superb cast delivers some real powerhouse performances.  Darryl Hannah brings an icy fury to her role as a vicious one-eyed assassin.  Michael Madsen invests his character with a world-weary, working class quality that nicely complements some of the other outrageous characters.  As the title character, David Carradine has both gravitas and a cool, serpentine grace--he's simply mesmerizing.  But make no mistake: it's Uma Thurman whose performance gives ""Bill"" it's biggest bang.  It's a powerful, multifaceted portrayal that's full of muscle, sweat, and emotional force.
The intelligent, clever script makes intriguing references to superhero mythology.  Tarantino and company strike an effective balance among humor, human drama, and mythic sense. And the action scenes deliver; one outrageous swordfight stands out in particular.  Overall KB2 is a fitting companion piece to KB1.  Together they tell a stunning, multicultural epic saga that is rich in larger-than-life characters and unforgettable images.  KB2 is a gem of virtuoso filmmaking with surprising emotional power.",1082592000,7,1646,5.588709677419355
1418059,2,B00005AQ65,"I must first say that I loved Vol. 1.  Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of Tarantino, per se, so I wasn't looking for snazzy dialogue and obscure soul and funk music references.  I probably could appreciate it because of my love of Asian action films, which are high on mindless revenge and low on character and plot development.  Vol. 2, on the other hand, was less satisfying.  People have said it was an homage to Spaghetti Westerns, a genre of film I'm not familiar with.  Well, besides the desert locations and Morricone score, what else was there?  If it was the slow pacing, pointless attempts at character development (who cares if Budd's working at a crappy job), and scenes that should have stayed on the editing room floor (like the brothel scene), then perhaps I haven't missed much.
I could nitpick at many little details from the film that left a bad taste in my mouth, but that would just turn into spoilers.  I just feel that Vol. 2 was a good 45 minute film stretched over 2 1/4 hours.  If these are supposed to be looked at as two separate films, then God help Tarantino if he tries to put the two together.  When he does combine the films, he should just stick to the mindless, yet stylish, revenge plot as the theme because that's what made Vol. 1 work as a film.",1082505600,7,1285,4.411016949152542
1418060,5,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill"" is one of the best films I have seen in years. Pretty much everything else out there is rather a parody, a sequel, or a re-make, which most of the time turn out to be crap (You can't count Volume 2 as being a sequel, because Tarantino did not intenionally make it that way).
""Kill Bill Volume 2"", though much different than ""Volume 1"", is a great touch on the Sphagetti-Western films of the 70's. Tarantino makes homages to the genre very well in this film, and leaves nothing out of place. This is a film I can pretty much enjoy and not criticize severely, unlike most films out there nowadays. The character development is great, the action is heart racing, the surroundings and mood of the film are top notch, and the soundtrack is awesome (Which has a more Western-esque theme than Volume 1).
So if you like Volume 1, or pretty much Tarantino films in general, you just might like this film. But if you are looking for Volume 1-type action, with tons of blood, over-the-top violence, and every other scene being a fight scene, do not expect it to be here. The story in Volume 2 is more character-driven, with less action and more dialogue (But I am not saying that is a bad thing).
I give this film a 5/5 because I pretty much enjoyed it from start to finish. I am going to try to see this film as much as I can, because in my opinion it was a pure thrill to watch.",1082505600,2,1381,4.295019157088123
1418061,5,B00005AQ65,"It's hard to say whether Volume 1 or Volume 2 is more enjoyable.  Someday in the near future, I hope to own the Complete Kill Bill Special Edition DVD collection.  Or maybe Tarantino will edit the whole thing together into one movie as it was originally planned.  Anyway, both films can stand by themselves.  True, there isn't a fight sequence in this film as monumental as The Bride fighting all of the Crazy 88's, but her fight sequence with Darryl Hannah (entitled provocatively, ""Elle and I"") will leave a lasting impression.
In the first film, we were left to infer things without getting all the information.  We never even actually ""saw"" Bill.  However, we formed certain expectations about him.  This film succeeds in confounding those expectations.  The film sequence turns out to be surprisingly poignant.  Of course, there is great Tarantino dialogue here as well - I didn't think anyone would come up with anything fresh to say on the subject of Superman, but he does.  All in all, this is an incredibly fun ride.",1082505600,,1025,4.805714285714286
1418062,5,B00005AQ65,"This isn't going to differ to much from other reviews, but I felt vol 2 was amazing. A shift from non-stop action and blood to intense character devolopment and dialoge. Not much happens in Vol 2 that I could say I thought would, actually probably nothing at all I expected.
I greatly appreciate what QT did by making these movies so different. It would of been easier for him to make it just a continuation of the 1st. I suspect if they were kept as one there would not of been such a shift in style. What QT did though was create 2 different movies. There are some spots that bring back some greatness of vol 1, but generally this movie is full of its own greatness.
All the questions you walked out of in vol 1 are answered. You get a feel for the characters you didn't get in vol 1. I have since watched vol 1 3 more times and enjoy it more now as I can place a lot more meaning to the movie, were as before it was straight up action (WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING!) The only problem I had with this film was I expected something different.
QT has an amazing ability to grap his viewers attention. You don't just watch his movies, you can often feel what the characters in his films are feeling. (Most evident in a scene involving Uma, Madson and the dessert - if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) He also has an amazing ability at storytelling, and bouncing the order of scenes around perfectly. There are spots were at first your thinking - Why did they put this scene here? - but once it moves to the next scene you answer your own question.
So far, individually, pulp fiction will still go down as my fav QT movie, but I hope Kill bill vol 1 and 2 will be re-edited into 1 movie, as QT originally had planned, with some scenes from Vol 2 mixed in to vol 1. This could overtake Pulp if done correctly. (Or at least how I imagine as correctly)
Long story short - SEE THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!",1082505600,,1917,4.155913978494624
1418063,5,B00005AQ65,"First, be sure you stay to watch the end of the film.  That means through the credits of the main characters in color and through the black & white credits with the Bride driving and through the long scroll of rolling credits.  Even when you get to the film's rating it is not yet time to go, so just sit there until the screen goes bright white.  Remember, you were warned.
Second, for everybody who thinks that on the basis of ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" that they know what is going to happen in ""Kill Bill, Volume 2,"" be ready to be surprised.  I made a point of watching the Bride (Uma Thurman) check Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) off of her people to kill list before I headed out to theater to see how the saga ended, so I thought I was perfectly in the narrative flow.  However, Quentin Tarantino has set up his audience just to play with their minds, which, of course, is what he was doing from the start and at the climax of this film I was not at all sure who, if anyone, was going to come out alive (especially since I was suddenly thinking about the tragic end of ""Lone Wolf and Cub"").
The caveat when Mirimax decided to split this four-hour revenge film into two volumes was that those who sensed a lack of character development and motivation in Volume 1 would be appeased by what was put forth in Volume 2, and this is indeed the case.  We finally get to go back and see a couple of pivotal scenes set before the ""beginning"" of the film's opening, with not only the massacre at the Two Pines wedding chapel but a training sequence in which the Bride studies with the great Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu), who will inspire many men to grow long flowing white beards that they can whip around dramatically as a punctuation to everything they say.  The net result is that character is more important than killing in the last half of the film, which makes sense because it would really be hard for the Bride to slice and dice more opponents than she did at the House of Blue Leaves.
There are a lot of oppositions between the two halves of this film.  The beautiful setting of the duel between the Bride and O-ren in the gentle falling snow is countered by the showdown with Budd (Michael Madsen) in the harsh sunlight of his trailer in the desert.  Having devoted an entire chapter to Hattori Hanzo creating his most perfect sword for the Bride, it is amazing how hard it is to get the sword out of its scabbard in this one.  Volume 1 was a feast for the eyes, but in Volume 2 Tarantino's dialogue becomes more prominent, although not quite up to the level of ""Pulp Fiction.""  But the dialogue is important because before we get around to the titular business of this film, the Bride and Bill have got to have themselves a conversation.  Sound also matters more in this film: there is one sequence that is effectively done in the dark.
I am barely acquainted with the genre of Hong Kong films that Tarantino was apparently weaned on, so everything is fairly new to me and smacks more of homage than parody, which is not doubt the director's intent.  I probably will not go out and check out some of the films that inspired Tarantino to do ""Kill Bill,"" because they will undoubtedly pale in comparison to the slicked up version that he is serving for our American palates.  All things considered, I have a slight preference for Volume 1, which runs counter to the prevailing sentiments, but I am still working out how the two parts fit together.  The key thing is that they do, without Volume 2 being simply more of the same.  There is something to be said for Tarantino pulling out all the stops just to have fun.",1082419200,,3639,4.368888888888889
1418064,5,B00005AQ65,"My review of the first volume defended Quentin's use of superfluous and important violence, this is about the entire film and how he dodged expectations for this second volume.  Everything Tarantino, is in this film.  It's funny, violent, emotional, and goes into lengthy, mundane passages that have importance to the plot. I have to credit him for making a movie that subverts audience expectation, he really messes with them/me during this film.  The first film made clear that the ones in the goup that were the big three in terms of emotional connection and/or dangerous, were Elle, Budd, and Bill.  It makes sense that these characters get good portions of the movie to show the true essence of their character. Quentin should win an award for the inevitable scene we've all been anticipating from vol. 1: when the Bride finally meets her daughter.  This scene pretty much epitomizes this second half of the movie and how it differs from the first. Tarantino allows the pot to simmer so long that we start to forget that it's simmering at all and then, like a snake, he bites us back awake.  This film is not the seemingly auto-pilot actioner of the first half, it gives you room to settle in. By the way, I also dug the ending in which he places a spaghetti western ending into a samurai fight. Very clever and appropriate to the film.  If he decides to make another film to follow this up I will see it carrying the knowledge from this film into it. Come to think of it, if he directs anything else I'll be there to see it.",1082419200,,1530,4.562043795620438

I went in knowing this would be a long movie at over 2 hours. I usually can't watch a movie that is over 90 minutes without getting bored and distracted. KB2 did manage to keep me pretty interested but there were too many times when my mind went off and I just didn't care.
The movie didn't suck. It had humor - I did laugh a few times. It had some good fight scenes. And I know know how to escape if I'm burried alive.",1082419200,2,600,3.808

Uma Thurman has become one of the best acresses or our time, she is now on my list of all time favorites, she delivers an Oscar caliber performance, I just hope the Academy remembers her this time, unlike last year for Vol 1. All the other actors were good as well. Quentin Tarantino knows how to get under our skin. Definetely the best movie and best performance by an actress of the year.",1082419200,,561,4.017857142857143

1418068,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 contained a lot of human bodies being mutilated and hundreds of thousands of gallons of blood sprayed throughout the sceneries.  It contained very little story (if any) and yet, was exilarating beyond belief.
After viewing Kill Bill Vol. 2 on its opening day and in its first showing, I was surprized at the fact that it contained one tenth of the action its predecessor had and that it was a dialogue driven film, containing a terrific story and very well written characters - and their depth.
The surprize was that this movie was more entertaining than the original one, which I claimed was ""one kind of film I have never seen before"".
QT claims the original to be the Eastern, with the Western approach, and the second film to be the Western, with the Eastern approach.
I have sat through the entire two hour and sixteen minute ride of dialogue and, literaly, off the wall action, and have to agree that this is one of the greatest action films I have ever seen, and one of the best films in recent years.
I will not say much of anything further because anyone who reads this can not decide whether to, or to not watch this film based on its lack of action - comparing to the original film - or based on my opinion.  One must decide upon a film after its (personal) viewing, and remember: this is a good movie.  It is very entertaining, it's beautifuly shot - in a wide screen approach -, and the dialogue compares with that of Pulp Fiction.",1082419200,,1481,4.477777777777778
1418069,3,B00005AQ65,"The Kill Bill movie series was a fun one to watch and Volume 2 was a decent ending. That being said, I have some problems with this film. *Spoiler Alert* The whole sequence with Bud was stupid, in my opinion. Keep in mind that I am fully aware of the unrealistic aspects of the film and of the series. You can not tell me however, that one of the best trained warriors in the world would just bust open a trailer door like Uma Thurman's character did. Come on! Try that in real life and you will get the same response, but the shotgun won't be loaded with rock salt. I was hoping for some kind of massive gun fight, paying homage to all of the Hong-Kong action movies with bullets flying everywhere. But no, we got Uma buried alive. Hmmph. Also, the ending ""battle"" with Bill was very anticlimactic. It should have been the swordfight to end all swordfights. I knew the exploding heart trick would come into play, I just didn't think it would be so quickly. Basically the fight with O-Ren Ishii in the first volume was the pinnacle of the fight scenes. All things considered this is a good, fun series, but it could have been much better.",1082419200,,1138,4.372641509433962
1418070,5,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 really work best when you consider them two parts of a whole. Combined, they tell a whole story and each one has what the other lacks. Volume 1 had style, razzle-dazzle filmmaking, a fast pace, lots of action and gallons and gallons of blood. Volume 2 lacks most of those qualities and instead gives us tried-and-true Quentin Tarantino dialog, more character development, and the biggest surprise of all, real human drama.
Dialog, yes. Lots and lots of it. Tarantino makes up for the fact that there was little of his brilliant dialog in Volume 1 by making the follow-up (not a sequel) a thoroughly talky affair. The Bride (Uma Thurman) and Bill (David Carradine) in their long-awaited confrontation, duel not with swords, but with words. Both actors turn in excellent performances which I hope will be remembered next year at the Oscars.
Indeed, this film is a major change of pace after the bloody mayhem of Kill Bill, Volume 1. It has the look and feel of a western (complete with references to Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah and others) as opposed to the primarily Eastern feel of the previous volume. Many viewers who enjoyed Volume 1 only for its action and bloodshed will no doubt be disappointed by this. However, Tarantino obviously had more in mind for Kill Bill and intended for it to be much more than just a brainless action flick which pays tribute to many samurai and kung fu movies. In Volume 2, he gets down to the nitty gritty and shows that he's trying to make a real film of real substance. Of course, (...) as the showstopping fight between Uma Thurman and Darryl Hannah reveals, but he's less interested in wowing the audience with action and violence.
Highlights include a scene where The Bride is buried alive which is made frighteningly effective by the brilliant use of sound effects, and a flashback to The Bride's training under kung fu master Pai Mei (played by Gordon Liu). David Carradine simply lights up the screen with his charismatic portrayal of Bill, straddling the line between murdering criminal and lovable human being. It's shocking how far this character is from the samurai-sword-stroking faceless villain that we got only a peek of in Volume 1.
Quentin Tarantino just may have made his masterpiece with Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2. He has managed to take the films that influenced and inspired him and turned them into something completely new and wholly Tarantino. Considering both parts as a whole, it adds up to a great movie that will be remembered for a long time to come.",1082419200,2,2542,4.753393665158371
1418071,5,B00005AQ65,"Quentin Tarantino's second installment for the Kill Bill movies has arrived and it is a triumph.  Separately these movies are four stars, but if released together, they would have been a five star epic.  The second one takes off where the other movie left, well sort of...let me explain.
This movie starts at the beginning, where the Bride (Uma) is rehearsing for her wedding.  Bill (David) locates the Bride and pops up at the chapel.  The scene is well written and ends with the slaughter of innocent people (well, some of them are innocent).  The scene is wonderfully directed in black and white and Tarantino demonstrates that sometimes not showing the violence adds to the sadness of the event.  Her where hear what happens, but do not see what happens.
Of course, the Bride lives and the movie takes up where she is after the rest of the gang, Bud (Michael), Elle (Daryl), and of course, Bill (David).  Another great scene is where Bud gets the upper hand and buries the Bride alive.  She has a flash back scene where she is trained by Pei Mai (played by Gordon Lu who was also in the first movie as the leader of the crazy 88s).  The best part of this scene in the wooden coffin is not the flash back scene that is interesting enough, but the sound and lack of visuals that is employed to give the audience a brief emphatic sensation of being buried alive.  It is an intense minute or so and once again demonstrates Tarantino's skills when they are at their best.
Lastly, Carradine's and Uma's finale is outstanding.  The fight scene could have been better, but the over all tension, conflict, once love, and dialogue simply recovers any lack of final great action scene.  Also, Tarantino did give the audience a nice fight between Elle and the Bride.  A great movie!",1082332800,,1774,4.593650793650793
1418072,3,B00005AQ65,"I was one of those who hated ""Vol. 1"" of this film. It was a joyless contraption of a movie, made by someone who had spent far too much time watching genre films and too little in real life. Volume 2 is somewhat better, with more characters and locations. ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) is on the final part of her quest for revenge against her ex-lover and boss Bill (David Carradine, having a great time). To reach Bill she must first do battle with two former colleagues, also expert hitmen like herself.

  Uma Thurman is the movie's greatest asset. It's a breakout role, where she manages to be scary, sexy, tough, vulnerable, athletic, etc, all at the same time. Whatever grounding KILL BILL has in actual human emotion is due to Thurman's fine performance. Indeed, there's a great deal of talent on display, but to what end? Michael Madsen (as Bill's brother Budd), performs with a wonderfully funny sociopathic warmth, and makes the movie go at his pace for awhile. Darryl Hannah is brilliantly revved up as Elle, the Bride's ""replacement"" in Bill's life. Tarantino stages a fine fight in a trailer and a great deal of swordplay, but KILL BILL falls apart in the last third when the Bride catches up with Bill, who has raised their daughter. These scenes are, quite frankly, ridiculous. The little girl behaves in a way no parent would recognize, and Carradine is wrestled to the floor by his self-serious dialogue. To paraphrase David Denby, Tarantino has become a director divorced from human experience. There's simply too much material here that was included because someone thought it was ""cool"".
Also with Gordon Liu (a terrible performance in a presposterous martial arts training sequence), Michael Parks, Bo Svenson, and Samuel L. Jackson. Overall rating for KILL BILL: 2 stars",1082332800,,1789,4.878289473684211
1418073,3,B00005AQ65,"Okay, QT's onscreen loveletter to Uma Thurman has reached it's conclusion.  Not a very epic one though.  I think that most people who enjoyed the first installment will not like this one as much.  Those who didn't like the first one at all might like it, but probably not.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie.  The acting was top-notch and Uma should definatley get a nod at Oscar time.  The influence of many types of genres is evident and fun to watch.  The sparse action is great when it happens.  But I left the theater feeling gyped somehow.  The dialog had it's good parts, but much of it didn't seem to pertain to the movie or go anywhere.  And there is so much of it.  If you are execting the wit and satire that harkens back to Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, it really isn't there.  And the climax of the movie...well, it was a bit anti-clamatic.
Kill Bill Vol. 2 isn't a terrible movie, it just doesn't live up to it's potential.  It is a suitible companion to Vol. 1, but you just can't help but think that if he mixed the elements of the 2 movies together a bit more, a great whole would have been the result.",1082332800,4,1127,4.264150943396227
1418074,5,B00005AQ65,"A film by Quentin Tarantino
""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" is a continuation of the story presented in ""Volume One"".  It is not a sequel, but rather the second part of one film.  Tarantino never originally planned on releasing this in two parts, but when his finished film came in over 3 hours Miramax and Tarantino decide to release it in two parts.  The result is two excellent films.  ""Volume One"" was a high action, stylish film with a lot of energy (and was also one of the better films of last year).  ""Volume Two"" slows down the pace quite a bit, but it remains just as excellent as the first.
The film opens with a black and white scene with The Bride (Uma Thurman) driving and speaking directly to the camera.  She gives a little recap of what has come before, and concludes by telling us that she still plans on killing Bill.  Since Tarantino does not work entirely chronologically, it is obvious this scene is set rather late in the film.  We know The Bride will make it to Bill (David Carradine), otherwise we don't have much of a movie, but we want to see how she makes it.  In the first film The Bride killed O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green, two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, but she still has two left.  Bill's brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).  I won't be spoiling anything when I say that nothing plays out the way you think it will.
There is one rather important flashback in the middle of the movie that shows The Bride's training with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).  We see a younger Bride, somewhat nave and less focused (though partially trained by Bill) come into her own as Pai Mei's student.  The lessons are brutal, but important both to explain The Bride's skills but also to directly set up a following scene.  Perhaps without the training, the following scene will not work.
As good as some of the fight sequences were in ""Volume One"", the fight with Elle Driver in this film is worth the price of admission with a moment that absolutely shocks (I've never heard a theater audience gasp quite like this before).  It is a great fight, highly appropriate for the characters and is a highlight of the movie.
For much of the rest of the movie, the pace is much slower, but it held my interest at all times.  The more I think about this movie, the more I like it.  I'm not sure it is quite as good as ""Volume One"", but it is a satisfying end to the film (counting both movies as one film) and it delivers some great moments.  I'd imagine that if you liked the first movie you'll see this one, but if you were on the fence, check out the first film and then head out and see ""Volume Two"".",1082332800,,2640,4.375
1418075,5,B00005AQ65,"QT amazes us once again!! While Kill Bill Vol 1. was extreamly violent, and the focus was primarily on the fighting,(which was GREAT!!) This film mostly focuses on the actual plot of the story and the characters themselves and their internal struggles. The diaologe is classic QT stuff, and is great. Reminded me of the Pulp Fiction diaologe, just briliant!!
Uma Thurman was just as amazing as in the first installment. She did a great job in carrying her emotion through the film and delivered a beleivable martial arts performance.
I have to say, I never even liked David Caridene before, but I was very, very IMPRESSED with his performance!! I think he did a great job acting and really was BILL. He definatlly gave me a new impression of him.  Solid Performance.
Gordon Liu is THE MAN and was GREAT!! Just hilarious! I am glad QT chose him to play the part instead of himself. Great Old School Kung Fu homage scences, complete with camera styles and music. Just great, expecially if your a Kung Fu movie fan, you will love the entire Pai Mei scene.
This half of one whole of a film is more of the internal side of confrontation. Dont get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes. (Expecially the fight scene againt Darrell Hanna!!) The film was mostly dialoge driven, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat and is classic QT genre.
For fans of the first half you will not be dissapointed at all!! For people who did not like Kill Bill Vol 1 for it's violence, I think you will enjoy this half, or at least appreciate QT's brilliance as a writer and director. I beleive this is as much a love story as it is a revenge tale. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This film took almost an entirly diffrent turn from the first installment. Where the first one was almost all violence [which was great]this one was more about a focus on characters. Don't get me wrong there was still enough of that in here.
This one starts out with the wedding massacre and draws it's tone off of that. It's more about the characters and their lives, and their history. We start off with Bill coming to wish our hero good luck with her new life and you know what happens from there. In fact we see BILL through out the entire film, and that was a wise choice because he is a great character.
I find it really funny that MICHAEL MADSION's character did what a bunch of ninja's couldn't do, defeat her. All he did was sit in his chair, wait for her to open the door, and blasted her. Then came the really messed up part when he buried her alive, man that was great.
Next up was the history of how she was trained to have all that skill, and that guy was great. He made me laugh the whole time, that guy was great. That actually might be my favorite parts of the movie.
Through out the film we get a little look at the history between BILL and ""THE BRIDE"" [you'll find out her name]. Those scenes have alot of impact on the final sequence of the film. If you don't pay attention the end might not make sense to you.
And like I said there is a nice amount of violence in this one, like when the beatifull Uma Thurman battles that one eyed chick. Wait till you see what happens.
The cinematography for this film was amazing, the shots threw out this film were just so good. And of course the writing for it was outstanding.
I don't really want to give up to much and ruin it for you, I highly recommend you all go out and see this movie ASAP.",1082332800,,1920,4.191891891891892
1418078,5,B00005AQ65,"When it comes to providing audiences with an exponential degree of action scenes and suspensful moments at their zenith, once again Quentin Tarantino delivers the goods, as he did in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"". In the first installment, one could find all the intense dramatics and artful kinetics in which to fill their martial arts hope chest. Now, in ""Vol. 2"", the items contained in said hope chest, are removed one-by-one, with a few extra goodies waiting to be discovered. While the story opens up in ""Vol. 1"", it comes to a climactic fruition in ""Vol. 2"", as the proceedings build up to an anxiety-laden slow burn, leaving the viewer to ponder whether or not our ravenous heroine, Black Mamba (Uma Thurman), will cut the villainous antagonist, Bill (David Carradine), down to size [or vice versa?]. The ""Mamba One"" has been successful at taking out all comers who've stood in her way a la ""Vol. 1"", but, will a different tale be told in the finale? This ""antagonizing"" question (and several others) is/are waiting to be answered at your local cinema now. Did I mention that Black Mamba has unfinished business with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah)? Yes, ""Miss One Eye"" herself! It all makes for an exciting conclusion, so fasten your seat belts! Be sure and make ""Kill Bill, Vols. 1 & 2"" a part of your video/DVD library (with ""Vol. 1"" out now, & with ""Vol. 2 coming soon!), 'cause you can't enjoy one without the other!",1082332800,,1414,4.705645161290323
1418079,4,B00005AQ65,"The Bride is back, and badder than ever. The second half of Quentin Tarantino's sprawling revenge epic ""Kill Bill"" is perhaps even better than the first, with twists, turns and more complications. Less action, more sizzling dialogue, and stuff that Part 1 only hinted at.
In part one of ""Kill Bill,"" the pregnant Bride (Uma Thurman) witnessed the slaughter of her fiancee, the guests at her wedding, and was shot in the head and left in a coma. Now, the Bride has killed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). She has yet to check off two remaining names: cold-blooded Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) and Bill himself (David Carradine).
The Bride also has to contend with Bill's not-as-sloppy-as-he-looks brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and continues working her way up the list until she gets to Bill himself, with the intent of getting revenge. But a monkey wrench is thrown into the Bride's revenge plans when she learns the truth: The baby she was pregnant with is alive.
Having established the sumptuously gory backdrop of Part 1, Tarantino concerns himself a little more with story in Part 2. There's more exposition on the DIVAS  (Gordon Liu appears as Pei Mei, with silky white hair and beard straight out of a shampoo commercial), and greater fleshing out of the characters like Bill. He's no longer a faceless monster, but someone you can almost like. The story itself has become more complex.
The psychedelic feel of this movie is undeniable. It's almost like a parallel world where people can saunter into planes with katanas. (Try that with airline security measures!) As in Part 1, there are some wonderful fight scenes. Just don't expect Uma to rush around beheading dozens of people with big geysers of blood -- instead there's the harrowing duel with Elle.
Tarantino's directorial experiments pay off, playing around with camera angles, graininess and color. His dialogue is sharp as the Bride's sword. Unfortunately, he seems a little too interested in Bill, whose scenes linger a little too long. However, Carradine and Thurman are both rock-solid in virtually every scene they are in. Hannah and Liu are fun to watch too.
This deliciously geeky mishmash is a western/kung-fu revenge saga set in a parallel universe (Tarantinoland?). ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" surpasses the first half of this sprawling story. Stylish and freakish and not to be missed.",1082332800,3,2380,4.994962216624685

It helps fill in those holes that were floating around in your head since the ending of the previous movie. All in all, this movie is a great ending to the set. Quentin does a great job rounding out the two movies and making the story flow together as if there was no break in between.
There may have been a little less fighting/blood in this movie. But, the dialogue and cinematography were simply astounding. Terantino once again shows that he is able to put out movies that is in his own wonderful style.
Thurman once again shows how well she is able to act on screen. Her emotions are almost palatable in ever scene she is in. Michael Madson plays a GREAT part in this movie, bringing you back to his days in Resevoir Dogs, but also showing a softer side as well.
Volume 2 is an excellent finish to the movies. It has a nice ending and has a suprising amount of emotion worked into it. This one is not to be missed.",1082246400,3,1017,4.302083333333333

Picking up where the first film left off, Vol. 2 finds the Bride (Uma Thurman) continuing her quest for revenge as she hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah) in America before finally taking on Bill (David Carradine).  The Bride's past is fleshed out and we learn what led up to the massacre at the wedding chapel which left our heroine in a coma and with a thirst for vengeance.  Thurman is still perfect in the role she was born to play, and Carradine gives his best performance in years.  Still though, you can tell this was a film that Tarantino made more for himself than for the movie going audience.  It's still his homage to grindhouse cinema, and it's still as fresh as Volume 1.

In VOL. 1, Kiddo went on a killing spree after she woke from a 4 year coma.  Blood and eyeballs just FLEW EVERYWHERE throughout this film.  She gets her revenge on a couple of the members of the ""assination squad"".
Now, shes back again to kick some ass in VOL. 2.  AND SHE DOES it with STYLE.  This movie answers some of the questions u were askin about the first one, like why ELLE had a patch on her eye.  I won't spoil the FUN for u.  I laughed during this movie every once in a while.  Its actually funny in spots, but not enough to make it a comedy.  The movie is quite serious though.  There is a lot of tears fallin in this one, and a ton of hatred being shown towards Kiddo's enemys (the way she kills them).
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie at all, except for the lacking of Bloodshed (but still GRUESOME).  It is just about as good as the first, SO GO see it, and u will HAVE FUN!",1082246400,,1061,4.0

Although Vol 2 answered many questions from Vol 1, I think that there was a lot of slow parts in the movie that could have been edited out.

Volume 1 is action packed and full of great dialogue and cinematography by Tarantino. It is not his best work as a movie, but the direction is definately full of classic Tarantino style. Sorry to say, but Volume 2 looks like it wasn't even directed by him. They look like two completely different movies. It was so slow, the dialogue was long and boring, and it lacks any type of style as far as direction goes. It was missing the style, camera movement, backround, and music that Volume 1 as well as his other movies have. I thought it was terrible and a complete let down to Tarantino fans. The ending was terrible and if Volume 1 ranked a 10, this would be ranked a 1. However, i do still recommend 1 for anyone who is a Tarantino fan. Sadly, he didn't come through on Volume 2.

1418086,3,B00005AQ65,"The second half of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" saga follows the continued journey of Uma Thurman's ""The Bride"" on her revenge mission against her former employer as well as the remaining members of her former hit squad. It's been more than a half-year between the two films and even though, the first volume was released on video the Tuesday before the second's premiere, that is still a lot of time to pass. One might liken it to the television cliffhangers but with both VHS and summer re-runs, it is far easier to stay up to date between the time. Here is where ""Volume Two"" suffers.
""Volume Two"" opens with Uma's Bride on her way to finish off her boss, Bill. Before she gets there however we flash back to where it all happened: a bloody slaughter at a chappel in Texas. From there, she continues on her hit list to Bill's alchoholic brother, Budd (Michael Madsen) and her subsequent replacement, Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah). Her battle with Driver is one of the most disgusting, exciting, and violent fights ever captured on film. This all leads to a showdown with Bill. David Carradine gives a top-notch performance. A character who was more or less confined to a ""villian in the shadows"" in the first film really finds his voice in this one. Perhaps the most entertaining scenes in the film revolve around The Bride training with a martial arts master named Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). Michael Parks, also gives a solid performance, showing up again, doing his Heston in ""Touch Of Evil"" as one of Bill's father figures, a Columbian pimp.
As promised, ""Volume Two"" puts more of an emphasis on Tarantino's trademark dialouge. There is still plenty of action going on but those who complained about the lack of hip conversation in ""Volume One"" may find this one more to your liking. A scene in which Bill speaks about his favorite superheroes is particulary cool and smacks of classic Tarantino. The second film is just as unapologeticly violent though at times, it is far less cartoonish about it. There are several scenes that involve torture and violent humiliation but it's all done in a somewhat tounge-in-cheek manner.
The biggest problem with the overall product is the splitting of the film. It seems that both volumes are missing key ingredients from the other. While ""Volume 2"" is a quality piece in itself, it doesn't seem to stand well on its own. People who didn't see ""Volume 1"", may have little to no interest in seeing the second half. While I suppose it could work on its own, the interest by this demographic doesn't look too promising. Miramax comes out the real winner though as they stand to make three times as much money on splitting the movie into two halves. Artistically, the film suffers somewhat because of it but in the end of the day, money talks. ""Volume 2"" will entertain anyone who loved the first but it's not gonna win over any new viewers. It's good old-fashioned violent fun at its worst.",1082246400,,2928,4.720703125
1418087,5,B00005AQ65,"Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is bold and entertaining.  Though Volume One had more action overall, this film is outstanding on many levels.  I had noted that some reviewers in this forum think this movie ""promotes"" further violence in society (or some similar dribble).  I'm not sure but I think there was violence before there were movies featuring violence.  I'll have to look that up...in any case, this movie was indeed filled with some violence.  It was also, however, filled with strong characters, a great plot, excellent writing, masterful action sequences and a great ending.  Not something we can say about 98% of all the movies released by Hollywood, a group that generally wouldn't know real quality if it was sitting on them.  So bring on your narrow views, this film can take it.  There's something to be said about a good old fashoned revenge story.  Tarantino knows that revenge is a primal urge and he plays it up to perfection in this movie.  One final note...if you've never seen an old King-Fu movie or at least one movie by Akira Kurosawa, then you really won't enjoy ""Kill Bill"" the proper way.

I really appreciate the dialogue and the accion scenes are superb especially the confrontation between the bride a elle driver. But I agree with some critique that the strengths of the first movie are the weakness of the second and vice-versa. This movie should have been 1 action movie no two volumes.

1418089,5,B00005AQ65,"I think that the scene where Bill finishes conversation with The Bride and they start to fight is one of the best examples of great cinema. Also. There was a western on TV just before Bill quickly pulled out the gun. Seemed to me like a warning...
Wish there were more scenes with the kung-fu master and frankly with all other characters. That would probably make it 10 hours  long. The movie has so much in it, it seems like some kind of ""best of"" episode of (good) TV series. Usually movies today would take a tenth what Kill Bill has and stretch it to 2 hours.
It's hard not to think about Sergio Leone (and Ennio Marricone) while watching Kill Bill, but it only makes you think that there isn't enough movies made this way.
The constant change of style is distracting, but in a good way. It also makes the movie more of a tribute or a show.

1418090,5,B00005AQ65,"I saw kill bill vol 2 last night and man was this a great movie.  Possibly the best I have ever seen in quite a while.
  The movie is pure originality and filled with grade A dialouge that only Tarantino can give.  The movie in all ways totaly lived up to my expectations and I still cant stop thinking about this masterpiece.  I think kb vol 2 stand on its own compared to vol 1.  The ending was quite suprising.  Not what I expected.  I love it!  The ending was beautiful and filled with tensions between the bride(...)
The movie is more on the love side than blood dringing battles that took place in vol 1.
Vol1 had more action and less dialoug but when you watch vol 2 you will be like ""What vol 1?"".  This film is so(...) good I might see it again.
Bride is back for her final cut as she has to kill her way until that last person is BILL.  She will encounter new enemies such as bud(Bills brother)who was once an assasin for the DivAs.  But now is a drunk who lives in a trailer.  The movie is also longer than vol 1.  Thats really a good thing..  The movie is filled with action that you won't be able to blink one eye....Ok yeah you can..  You also take a stroll around the park as you see how The Bride(...) Learned her techneek.  From her master who is very dissaplint at what he teaches, the bride will stop at nothing to get what she came to do.  The movies dialouge is the most important one of all.  So pure.  So good only Tarantino can give us this!  I won't spoil anything for you but I can assure you this.  Kill Bill volume 2 is a masterpiece.  It is very underated and for those who think its over rated get your hw and come back when you realize what you've been missing out on.  Original, Pure, The best.  I choose this as my 2004 film of the year!
Final note......
DO NOT!  I REPEAT!  DO NOT GET Vol 1 or vol 2 on dvd.  If alot of people know how Tarantino is you know one damn thing....There will always be some Collecters edition crap with lots of added footage and great behind the scene footage.  What I'm trying to say is there will probably be some 3 disc  collecters edition with the unrated/Directors cut filled with all the color and gore you can feed on.  And it will probably have some great footage.  Though I don't think vol 2 didn't have any violent things taken out since it's main purpose wasn't violence in vol 2.  Even though there is 200$ special edition box set in japan just wait for some collecters edition to hit US probably around the end of 2004 or sometime in 2005.  Just wait.
But for now go and see Kill Bill volume 2.

1418095,4,B00005AQ65,"I didn't like Kill Bill: Volume 1.
To sum up, it seemed like Quentin Tarantino wanted to introduce audiences to a variety of film styles at the expense of an actual plot.  Using just about every trick in the book, Quentin did just that, introducing us to 70s Blaxploitation flicks, anime, and a bunch of other styles I couldn't identify.  The anime was the most galling (both the actual animated short that had little relevance to the plot, and the attempts at live-action anime), as anime was meant to be a sort of shorthand for artists - the big eyes are easy to draw, the flashing movement means less frames, etc.  Quentin took it and turned it into some sort of art form and then acted as if he owned it, only he didn't pull it off convincingly to folks who know their anime.
But Kill Bill: Volume 2 (KB2), makes up for it.  Indeed, if the two movies had been edited down and put together, the whole thing would be a masterpiece.  Instead, it's a film that's good enough to make me wish Quentin had taken the deep breath he took between the two films and edited them down into a cohesive whole.
So what does KB2 do right?
Quentin knows he had so much ridiculous violence in the first movie that it's probably still giving the Ratings board fits. So as a result, he uses the threat of violence to excellent effect.  The katana that The Bride normally wields is almost never used - indeed, the big ""sword fight"" keeps getting interrupted by the fact that the sword isn't always the right tool for the job.  Quentin lets us know that he KNEW he went too far in the first movie and it was to prove a point.  I just wish the first movie hadn't taken so long to make it.
Like the first movie, Quentin takes the time to pay homage to other flicks.  There's a delicious 70's Kung-Fu type flashback sequence with a white bearded, longhaired master.  Everything's there, from the sword hopping to the waist dodging.  Only this time I got it - I knew the films Quentin was mimicking and thought it was funny.  Also, he didn't bounce around at high speed amongst so many movie styles that it gave me a headache.
As always, Uma Thurman gets to emote.  She emotes rage, terror, and affection with great range.  Her lines are gawd-awful, however (I'm still debating whether or not that's on purpose).  Since there's less sword-fighting going on, Uma looks less ridiculous wielding her sword like it's an axe.  Uma's utterly unconvincing as a martial artist, so this is a good thing.
There are a variety of parallels in the characters and their depth.  Issues of motherhood vs. fatherhood, the well-being of a child vs. the violence a mother will go to protect said child, the ability to kill a man or let him ultimately kill himself, and even the theme of an eye-for-an-eye is present.  Quentin covers a range of topics and makes you think, makes you aghast at the situation, and then drives relentlessly forward with his own conclusions.  There are no hanging questions.
One word sums up this movie: focus.  Quentin retains it, keeps it, and draws the audience in along with him, even through some very long conversations where no limbs are being sliced up like fine ham. If there's a flaw, it's that KB2 is a very different film and it's likely impossible that people will love both equally.
If KB1 was a series of flashy moves with no substance, KB2 is the gut punch that takes the wind out of you.  Two thumbs up from Maleficent and I.",1082160000,,3428,4.48792270531401
1418096,5,B00005AQ65,"Having watched vol. 1 on DVD just a few days ago, I was expecting much the same thing from vol 2, but found that it was completely different.  The opening scene, looking from the front of the car as The Bride drives along, reminded me of the scene in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, where Melanie Daniels is driving along a mountainside road.  Both sequences, simple as they may be, hint at what's to come.
I was quite surprised that this did not have the beginning to end fights and action of vol. 1.  This was much more story driven -- and instead of continuing the story, spent much time going back to things that had happened before vol. 1, explaining why much of the things were happening.  Vol 2 also gave much more depth to the characters.  It was interesting to see Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver become even more arrogant in vol. 2, and to see how that arrogance always got her into trouble.
The psychological twists at the end, where it becomes clear that The Bride and Bill have an intense love/hate relationship, makes the viewer think at every step that they know what's going to happen next, only to be much surprised as it takes off in another direction.
One of the main things I got from both movies was the determination of the Bride, which Uma Thurman portrayed very well.  Consistently, no matter what is done, she always manages to come through -- but now in vol. 2, there is also an emotional, human side to the charater seen as well.
I rarely go back to see a movie in the theaters a second time, but this one I will -- and I'll be anxiously waiting for it to come out on DVD.",1082160000,,1592,4.361486486486487

The Kill Bill story is very simple, The opening scene of Vol. 1 allowed the rest of the film to flow visually and conceptually without rules, it assumes that you have already seen 3 more movies about revenge, so it doesn't spend too much time dwelling on a story that you heard before.
Vol 2.focuses on characters who yap about the obvious. The only interesting revelation in this movie is Bill's motive for doing what he did, other than that 2 minute monologue, I was really disappointed.",1082160000,4,745,4.525925925925926
1418098,2,B00005AQ65,"I saw Kill Bill 2 last night, and was disappointed. Dissapointed that all the hype that this movie deserved did not fit what was put on the screen. Kill Bill vol. 1 was a good movie, I didn't think it was as good as Reservoir Dogs, but I thought it was one of the better movies to come out in the past half decade. I loved the fact that Tarantino could take so many things he loved, and pay homage to them while also somewhat poking fun at them. Kill Bill vol. 2 is not Kill Bill vol. 1, do not go into the movie expecting to see 500 million gallons of blood everywhere. Sure there is a little blood shed, but nothing like the first one. This movie is long, well not really, it just seems that way, with the numerous amounts of dramatic pauses, and scenes that extend way to long. Quentin Tarantino loves to write dialogue, I've known that since seeing the opening scene of Reservoir Dogs, but for my taste's he over does it in this movie. It seems everyone and their mother has some interesting, witty, story to tell about some off based topic, that ties into whats going on in the movie, but is not needed. Sure every one in awhile a nice little anecdote is needed, especially the way Tarantino writes, but this script is filled with them, and that is irritating. I am sure that people who love Quentin Tarantino will love this movie, I don't love Tarantino, I love the movies he has made, and the way he has been able to be different in all of his movies, and bends the rules when it comes to making them. This one however just did not do it for me, Kill Bill definitly needed to be split into two movies, because watching the entire version of it in one sitting, not only would numb someones ass to sleep, but would also be like seeing two different movies, because halfway in the middle, it changes to a totaly different movie. This is just my opinion, take it for what its worth, see the movie if you saw the first, however if you haven't seen the first, then don't bother seeing this.",1082160000,3,1991,4.26984126984127
1418099,5,B00005AQ65,"The Bride got herself some bloody satisfaction in ""Kill Bill, vol. 1"", and she got a whole lot more in ""Kill Bill, vol. 2"". And, after seeing both films -- the first on DVD and the second about 2 hours ago at the cinema -- I'm pretty bloody satisfied myself.
Is it violent? Yes.
Is it over the top? Yes.
Is it approriate for children? Probably not.
Is it a good film? Hell yes!
(...)
First off, any kid that can handle seeing Bambi's mother get shot by hunters in the Disney cartoon can handle the violence in ""Kill Bill"" if they've got a set of sensible parents.
Second, Tarantino is sending a message about a parent's responsibility to her children. The Bride didn't walk out on Bill on a whim; the fact that she was pregnant and wanted to raise her child in peace drove her to leave and set in motion the events depicted in the film.
If all you see is mindless ultraviolence, get your eyes checked.",1082160000,,901,4.305882352941176
1418100,5,B00005AQ65,"The first time I saw a trailer for Kill Bill, Vol. 1, I thought, ""What is Quentin thinking!?""  I admit it looked horrible, but being an avid fan, I saw it the first chance I got.  It easily became one of my favorite movies!  While the dialogue was lacking ""Taratino-ness,"" I couldn't get over the beauty of the film, the cinematography is unmatched and it is some of the best action ever on film (and I usually HATE action movies).  I got the soundtrack soon after, which is equally as amazing!  I saw it 4 times in the theatre and didn't think I could wait when they pushed back the release date for Vol. 2 to April 16th.
It was WELL WORTH the wait!  I just saw the film yesterday and I LOVED IT!  From the beginning it hooks you (especially with the introduction of Samuel L. Jackson's cameo!!!)  It is EXTREMELY different from the first film, however.  The Japanese, which is the dominant background of the first film, is replaced with Texan desert.  The beautifully choreographed fight with the Crazy 88, is replaced with a dirty catfight in a trailer (which is definitely NOT a bad thing).  The Bride vs Elle Driver is easily one of the best parts of the film and, without doubt, the best fight (eliciting audible cheers from the viewers in the theatre).
Uma's dramatic side emerges in the second volume, and it is unmatched.  In her struggle with Budd, we see a humiliated, scared Uma; with Elle Driver, we see a furious Uma; and with Bill, we see a caring Uma.  She is such a multi-dimesional character!
The review would not be complete without mentioning the amazing soundtrack!  Track 2 - ""Goodnight Moon"" by Shivaree, which plays during the end credits, is fantastic, as is ""Silhouette of Doom"" by Ennio Morricone (who contributes three songs to the soundtrack).
I'm planning on seeing this as many times as my wallet will allow before it leaves the theatre.  It tops Vol. 2, taking a hit more at the emotions than the eyes (as Vol. 1 did).

1418101,5,B00005AQ65,"All I have to say ""Kill Bill"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.  After watching Kill Bill vol. 1 I couldn't wait to find out how it ends.  And how could it end?  I mean all the action in the first half, how cand it be topped?  Easy the best way Quentin knows how...with great dialogue and wonderful Characters.  So yes, vol. 2 is more dialogue then action.  Which in no means makes it worth then the first.  In fact vol. 2 two gives ""The Bride and Bill""  a senses of real emotions.  It's great, they both aren't cold hearted killers as first thought of.  This movie has it all in my opinion.  Great action scenes of memorable action, be sure to check out the fight between the Bride and Elle, funny and really cool how Quentin pulled it off, same thing with The Bride and Bill fight.  Very cool.  If you really liked the first one just based on the action then you might be a little disappointed, but if you like Quentin's films for what they truly are, you'll really like this film!!!",1082160000,,1006,4.177083333333333
1418102,2,B00005AQ65,"As a fan of the original, I was expecting fast pacing, action and lots of fight scenes. I was disappointed. For every 5 minutes of good stuff, there were 30 minutes of fluff.

I would have cut several scenes out or at least in half: The ""strip club"" scene was a waste. The ""Superman"" speech was lame.  The ""wedding rehearsal"" was a useless.

David Carradine's character kept telling drawn-out stories and kept telling them. I was sitting there thinking, ""Come on already. Get to the point, Bill!""

KB2 was the equivalent of ""Empire Strikes Back"" with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader sitting down for a chat instead of fighting.

Someone needs to re-do this movie with some decent fight scenes and a lot more emphasis on Uma. Bill was scarier when you did not see him in KB1.",1082160000,2,773,4.572463768115942
1418103,2,B00005AQ65,"Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a smart and extremely well-crafted film.  The dialogue was engaging, the script was tightly-knit, and the characters were memorable.  Vol. 2 continues where the last film left off, but much of the energy and excitement that was present in its predecessor is now absent, replaced with borish conversations and lackluster action sequences.  Tarrantino used all his creative talent on Vol. 1 and left nothing for Vol. 2.
One of my favorite things about Kill Bill Vol. 1 was the witty comparison of eastern and western cultures.  Tarrantino threw in some wild curveballs for his dedication to eastern cinema and art, including a Japanese band that played American Rock 'N Roll, a deadly assassin donning the cliche Japanese schoolgirl outfit, and even an anime cartoon in the middle of his movie!  Vol. 2 was really much different in that it had more of a spaghetti western theme to it.  I'm not automatically saying that this idea hurt Vol. 2, but it simply did not seem that as much thought and care were placed into the project.  Even the set designs and costumes were below normal Tarrantino quality.
The biggest letdown about Vol. 2 was the poor character development, something that Vol. 1 was exceptionally good at.  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 we see that although Vernita Green and O'Ren Ishii are vicious killers, they actually have some compassion and soul in them.  For example, we know that Vernita Green really loves her daughter, and O'Ren's sense of honor gives her a noble quality.  However, in Vol. 2, we know almost nothing new about Elle Driver, the one-eyed nurse.  Instead, we get two chapters focusing on Budd, the least engaging member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  Bill turns out to be a boring old man, and not the ruthless murderer that we were led on to believe from Vol. 1.  Quite possibly the only good thing that came out of Vol. 2 was the introducing of Pai Mei, the long-browed mentor of the Bride.  No Sophie, no Gogo, no Crazy 88's, not even Buck!
In short, what you have here are two different films:  Vol. 1 was more of the straight action film, while Vol. 2 tried to develop the plot and wrap up the story.  What upset me the most was not that Vol. 2 had so few fight sequences, but that they were such piss poor fight sequences.  It wasn't an action film, which is what I paid to go and see!  And not only that but Tarrantino could not find creative ways to finish off Budd, Elle Driver, and even Bill.  But what can I say, if you enjoyed the first half, you're almost certainly going to have to witness the conclusion for yourself.
2 stars out of 5.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 is nothing but a dull blade, whilst its predecessor slashed its way into becoming one of the most memorable movies in recent years.  A weak followup in terms of story and overall style.

1418105,4,B00005AQ65,"If cinema is ever in need of edgy freshness, then Charlie Kaufman is the man to turn to.  But when that need arises and has to be fused with humorously offbeat style then Quentin Tarantino is the Kaufman of directors.  Or is Kaufman really the Tarantino of aspiring writers?  It doesn't matter.  In any case, what truly matters is that Tarantino continues to inject that richly abnormal talent of his into his latest piece ""Kill Bill: Volume 2.""
Four years after being betrayed by her former boss Bill (David Carradine) and shot in the head at her wedding, The Bride (Uma Thurman) wakes up from her coma and thirsts for revenge. After dispatching Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren (Lucy Liu) in ""Volume 1,"" this previously retired assassin is back in ""Volume 2"" to finish off the rest of Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and ultimately, kill Bill.
""Volume 2"" is definitely the heart of the two movies.  Saturated with intense fighting scenes ""Volume 1"" ended with a bitter sweetness as The Bride seemed completely undeveloped as a character.  But ""Volume 2"" complements the first movie nicely as the action takes the passenger seat and Tarantino concentrates on storytelling, fleshing out The Bride's character.  There's actually emotional depth involved now, revealing The Bride's relationship with Bill as well as her motives for leaving an assassin's life.
Thurman is wonderful as The Bride, playing along with Tarantino's take on Hollywood cheesiness to executing some intense dialogue scenes that transition between emotions within seconds.  Tarantino is obviously extracting all the skills he can from Thurman, and the end result is worth every squeeze: she pulls off acrobatic feats and heavy dialogue in the same two hours with seamless changeovers.
Carradine also does such a marvelous job of portraying Bill to the point that it becomes frightening.  Carradine's subtleties are what form this character and by the end of it all it becomes clear just how insane of a character Bill is: he philosophizes about death while making sandwiches and questions past relationships with a menacing sword in hand.  The low and relaxed tone that he carries through the movie makes it feel like Carradine isn't even playing anyone, he's just slipping this character on like an old, comfortable shirt.
But it's not just the characters that make Kill Bill so special.  The first installment is wonderful in paying tribute to Japanese anime, folksy spaghetti westerns and an overall homage to ""old school"" Asian kung fu flicks. Tarantino again draws various sources from 70's pop culture to showcase the quirks of ""Volume 2.""  Whereas the first movie displays Tarantino's knowledge of Asian cinema with wire-wearing kung fu, with unrealistic squirting samurai-movie colored blood included, ""Volume 2"" solidifies that homage to the full extent.
Perhaps the single greatest movie moment of 2004 is in ""The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei,"" the film's chapter in which the origin of The Bride's abilities is discovered.  Tarantino brings out all the stops on this one.  From the stereotyped supercilious personality to the superficial white facial hair, the character of kung fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) is the absolute embodiment of a 70's Chinese kung fu flick. After this scene, it's obvious that Tarantino is on the edge of oddball insanity, right there with brilliance on the other side.
Like the chapter of Pai Mei, the rest of Tarantino's film combines everything campy and corny with his bizarre sense of direction.  And everything rationally ridiculous here somehow ends up as abnormally gorgeous.",1082073600,4,3606,5.129692832764505
1418106,5,B00005AQ65,"I don't think there's been another movie that I have anticipated more than Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Yes, more than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Matrix.
Even though we know that Uma Thurman's Bride character will ultimately fulfill her mission, it's the journey that is so interesting and as expected, it's not as clear-cut or as simple as it might seem.  There are lots of surprises in Vol. 2, particularly in the development of the characters.  Most notably, the gradual revelation of Michael Madsen's character Budd, who seemed simple yet sympathetic in the first one yet has more up his sleeve than anyone might know; the Bride's own complex and tainted backstory which gets more screen time in this edition; the sheer wickedness of Elle is even nastier - and enjoyable - than anyone picked up from Vol. 1; and then there's Bill himself, evil yet oozes an undeniable charm.
The cast is excellent, with David Carradine and Uma Thurman playing star-crossed lovers who have paid the cost of being professional killers.  Most surprising is Daryl Hannah.  Never considered a great actress, Hannah pulls a Charlize Theron and gives a dynamic performance as Elle; she's wicked, cunning and dangerous, providing a worthy foe to anyone she's matched with, most notably Thurman's character.  Their showdown in a trailer is simply stunning.
I'm sure there will be those who will be disappointed by Vol. 2, but it provides enough surprises, and equal amounts of comedy, drama and action, that it's never less than entertaining.",1082073600,,1516,4.948818897637795

This film of course has everything the first volume had...suspense, comedy, action, gross-out moments, surprises...and satisfaction. This movie is very satisfying! It won't disappoint! I was wondering if the secomd volume would be shorter than the first, but to my surprise, the second volume itself is two hours long, and sitting through it really paid off. Quentin Tarantino delivers this masterpiece...and the actors couldn't have dun a better job. I have newly found respect for the talents of Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, and Darryl Hannah.

1418108,5,B00005AQ65,"I have just seen Kill Bill vol. 2, on an IMAX screen, an hour ago, and it was perfect. It did not let me down, because I loved the first one, and this was just as good.
The story that began in Vol 1, comes to a close, as the Bride ( they reveal her name in this movie) is seen more as a person, a mother and most of all, a human being, rather than a killing machine.
She gets to come face to face with Elle Driver, Bud, and Bill.
We get to learn of her past, of how she became this great warrior, her studies of martial arts with Pai-Mei, and we see how her jurney ends. Each fight and encounter of how she faces these characters is briliant in it's own way.
There were moments where I though "" how on Earth will she get out of this blunder"" and then there are some great conversatins she has with the people she came to kill. There was a bit less fighting, and more talking than in the first one. But all the action sequences were awesome. The one with Elle in teh trailer was great! Dont want to spoil it, but it's eye grabbing!
Overall, it was a beautiful movie, with views of the El Paso, desserts, and a hot climate. The music was amazing as well. A  lot of Ennio Morricone goosbump producing melodies. I think of it more as Vol 1 and Vol 2 as being a perfect one movie all in its own, and I think the Kill Bill saga, has became my favorite movie of all time. I love them.

1418109,5,B00005AQ65,"QT does it again. Mostly predictable, studded with B-grade violence, exploitation and saddled with a cliched message of love, maternal instincts and retribution Kill Bill Volume II looks, on the face of it, a disaster. But solely on the back of QT's cleverness, audacious showmanship, mockery/homage, use of in-references and his always impeccable sense of music Kill Bill II rises to a level of celluloid art that few modern movies have. In a sense it is more Pulp Fiction than Kill Bill I: less of gore ( a bit---still enough of gougings, cruelty and claustrophobia to keep us satiated) and more of weighty musings on the difference between Spiderman and Superman and the 5 point exploding heart. The posturing ponderous seriousness of the pulp variety that made Pulp Fiction so endearing is back in full force in Kill Bill II.

Some movies have a story, some movies have great acting: some movies have both of them. And then there comes, once in a while, a movie which has nothing going for it except great direction. And that alone makes it worth the entrance, the popcorn and a squishy eyeball or two !",1082073600,,1107,4.765625
1418110,5,B00005AQ65,"STORY: What I love about the second half of Quentin Tarantino's film is that there is so much more insight to it then what he had in the first half. The first half of the film was mainly a downright hardcore satirical look at grindhouse cinema, but in part 2 we get so much more grandiloquence and the dialogue is full of duel meanings. It's funny though because most people will never get anything out of this movie except for an adventure tale of revenge. People will see the movie solely based on Tarantino's name and the idea that ""oh, he made Pulp Fiction, that won an Academy Award, hmm this must be good then"". There was one scene in the film where something very grotesque happens, probably the most grotesque thing of the second half of the film, but when it happened the group of average teen moviegoers sitting behind me replied with a ""that was rough"". Sure it was ""rough"", but the symbolism attached to it is so much more. In another scene in the film David Carradine compares Uma Thurman to Superman. The simile to that was that Superman's costume was not his cape but his alter ego Clark Kent. Superman was born with those cloths and the only reason he is Clark Kent is to blend in with ""us"".  Every other super hero must put on a mask in order to become the super hero, but Superman is a super hero in disguise not a person disguised as a super hero. Probably one of the most meaningful parts of both films is the bride's training with Pei Mei, a humorous caricature of a Chinese Kung Fu master. All the while a humorous spectacle to the literal viewer, it is a meaningful spectacle to the critical viewer.  In another scene right before Uma Thurman is burried alive in a coffin the aspect ratio changes from widescreen to fullscreen, the screenshot is just a square showing only Uma lying on the ground as we only hear Budd (Bill's brother) digging her grave, and immediately following that the shot is of her in the coffin and all we hear is Budd burying her. I am so amazed that Tarantino has all this knowledge and all this insight when he never even completed High School, really! The second half overall though is completely different from the first. The tone turns from Akira Kurosawa to almost a hint of Sergio Leone with a dash of. . . well. . . Tarantino.  This second part gives us a humorous look at the truths of human nature and the lives we lead, and yes, we finally get to hear the bride's name even though it really doesn't matter and that is why it was bleeped out before.
ACTING: My god, David Carradine was so good in this movie. All we saw of him in the first half was his hands, but now we see him in full glory. The acting is so good in this movie expecially Uma Thurman. Even though this is still part of the first half I feel that her performance in the second half was so much more emotional. If Uma wins the Oscar I would not be surprised at all, but that is saying a lot and it is early in the year. The supporting cast is great too and not one role has been miscast or acted badly. When you have a perfect cast it makes for an enjoyable experience something that The Alamo lacked.
BOTTOM LINE: I support the idea of splitting this long epic into two parts because to see them both as one film could actually be too much to handle and cause a brain emergency shutdown. Tarantino gave us the perfect dosage with each half, and it is amazing how well they each stand on their own as two separate films. I still find it hard to believe how a high school dropout managed to make it in this business just by knowing the right people at the right time all while working at a video rental store and ending up a winner of an Academy Award. Quentin Tarantino has made a name for himself. I just hope he doesn't wait another six years before making another film.",1082073600,2,3796,4.306293706293706

The sound effects had a great effect in this one, better then the first I believe.  I liked how we got to know the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad more also.

 - Budd informs his brother, Bill, he isn't afraid of commitment in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"".
Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue (in this case its a pregnancy test). ""The Bride"" finishes what she started as she closes in for the kill in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"".
""Vol. 2"" continues the story of ""The Bride's"" revenge with the chapters ""The Massacre at Two Pines"" (the viewer finds out it wasn't actually a wedding but a dress rehearsal), ""The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz"", ""The Sadistic Training of Pei Mai"", ""Elle & I"", & finally ""Face to Face"" (for the record, O-Ren Ishii, a.k.a. ""Cottonmouth"", received a tragic brain transplant, while Vernita Green, a.k.a. ""Copperhead"", got ""The Bride's"" point over a bowl of ""Kabooms"" in ""Vol. 1"").
The film, like ""Vol. 1"", has ""cult film"" written all over it (this has got to be, arguably, Quentin Tarantino's two best films). ""Volume 2"" is less violent than the first ""Bill"" and keeps the blood spurting in check. The action is still great (the fight between Hannah and Thurman is claustrophobic and has some funny moments, but, I couldn't stop thinking where in the hell that damn snake was hiding! Since I hate snakes, I was waiting for it to jump out!).
The performances were great throughout. Michael Madsen gives an outstanding performance as Budd (its hard not to like the guy. Yeah, even after he puts 2 slugs (full of rock salt) into ""The Bride's"" chest & then buries her alive). He also has some of the better lines in the film (""Wrong brother, you hateful b*tch."" , is his greeting to Elle Driver on his cell phone). Daryl Hannah is awesome as the menacing, hateful Elle Driver (it hurt to see Budd go into that final goodnight but it was great at what happened to Elle!). Uma Thurman's cold, pissed off, daggers in the eyes, facial expression's to Bill while she hugs her new found daughter was the price of admission alone and David Carradine, as Bill, goes from phantom menace in the first ""Bill"" to jilted lover in this film is quite a revelation. The final showdown itself is quite good but not what I expected.
Tarantino's direction is great, as always, this time, paying tribute to the spaghetti western (think desert heat. Lots of it). Hittori Hanzo is heard but not seen. The soundtrack is outstanding, borrowing from the great Ennio Morricone and artists Chingon, & Shivaree (both play over the closing credits). ""Kill Bill"" is a must see for fans of the Shaw Bros., Sergio Leone, westerns and any and all action films of the genre.
I'm anticipating ""Volume 2"" to hit DVD in Sept. or Oct. of '04 and hopefully, an ultimate box set with director commentary (Tarantino certainly has the mouth for it) with everything but the Vasilube thrown in sometime in the near future.
Above all, ""Kill Bill"" is, basically, a love story. What a valentine. Thanks ""Q & U"".",1082073600,,2933,4.706225680933852

Volume 2 takes place where volume 1 left off. After the killing off Vernita Green (Vivica Fox), the bride (Uma Thurman) is looking for number 3 on her list, ""Budd""(Michael Madson) she finds herself on Buds trailer in the middle of the desert. Budd is warned by Bill (David Carradine) that she is coming, the bride then simply realizes she has to go through Budd and Elle to go to Bill. Then as you would remember in the end of volume 1 Bill gives a message that her daughter is still a live, then the bride suddenly realizes her daughter is still alive. Quentin Tarantino delivers an astonishing film. This volume I like better than volume 1, but that's me.
In this film you see the training the bride had to go through. And in this volume they reveal the brides name. In the first volume it takes place in Japan, in this film it's a mixture of China, Mexico, and America. This film has some scenes that are really hard to look at like volume 1. There was this one particular scene I looked away, when you watch this film, I'm pretty sure you can guess what scene.

1418114,5,B00005AQ65,"I just got back from seeing this film and I must say I was a little let down when the credits began to roll. Sure it was a very good film, but in my opinion the slower pacing of the film should have been in Volume One and the quick action pace should have made up Volume 2. I understand QT's motive was to draw our attention in the first film and explain most of it in the second. First off, the acting is even better this time around because we get to know the characters inside and out. Uma Thurman again nails the role she was destined to play. Madsen was his usual self (not really a bad thing), and I love him for it. Daryl Hannah was one of the two shockers in this movie. She provides the best and most believable female villian ever. I thought her career had died...well it has been ressurected. Her ""cat fight"" with Uma in the trailer was brutal and flat out exciting and had a squishy ending that made many cringe in distust. Finally, the best for last. David Carradine as Bill was flat out an awesome casting choice. The character Bill was given so much dialogue in this film I think it would have been boring unless the actor speaking it could hold our attention throughout. Carradine's voice, manurisms, and delivery were top notch and should easily earn him an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor. Sadly there are not as many homages to old films in this one and the music is good, but not nearly as great as in Volume 1. Nevertheless, this is a fitting conclusion to this epic pair of films. I will certainly be seeing it again in a few days. To those reading this review who have not seen it yet, remember that it is much slower than Vol. 1 and is loaded with dialogue rather than letting the action speak for the film. Before I forget, the master instructor, Pai Mei, is truly a colorful personality who is funny in an intimidating kind of way and another of the many characters that you will remember when leaving the theater. I must also mention that buried alive scene which was done so well I actually thought the dirt was being dumped on me. Forget the over-the-top gore and non-stop thrills from Vol. 1, and sit back and take in the meaty complexity and marvel that is Vol. 2!",1082073600,,2201,4.331719128329298

He also uos the laughs, which is the saving grace of this second installment, The great thing about Tartantino's homage to revenge and Kung Fu is that he doesn't take himself to seriously. There are some incredible cheeky moments in this movie, that if handled wrong would have just come off as corny, but under Tarantino, it's hilarious. The senes between Una as the Bride and Gordon Lui as her sterotypical Kung Fu master were just brilliant. Here Lui plays it up as a legendary master who flips at the slightest show of American sass. His brutality and disapproval only motivates The Bride into improvement. It is the archetypical sequence of any Kung Fu movie, and here it funny and fun and a welcome shift in the tone of the movie. The rest of the movie is a series of one on one encounters with Bill's henchman and a predictable final encounter with Bill.  This movie is not classic, but it definately offers a fun time at the cinema.",1082073600,,1112,4.477832512315271

At this point, two of those people have already been offed; three are left: Bud, Elle Driver, and, of course, Bill. As usual, things don't start off quite smoothly, as to extend the running time, but it does end in a fashion that I'm sure you can easily infer from the title.
Let me say this: You can watch this movie, regardless of the fact of whether or not you've seen the first. The movie starts off conveniently enough with a recap of the first film. It clears up a couple details, however, and deepens the plot.
The plot thickens with Volume 2 as it reveals a couple of interesting, if not integral, details, such as why Elle has that black eyepatch or who Bud really is in relation to Bill. Of all the characters focused on in this one though, Bill is the most interesting and undeniably the coolest. His precise motives for offing the Bride are revealed and, in the end, is humanized.
And this leads to another detail: This volume is not as overtly action-packed as Volume 1. This ain't a fight-fest. Fights are restricted to the three central characters in the film. There's no fight scene with 88 henchmen. Just one on one, mano a mano. This Volume's primary goal is to develop the story, which while not that complex, is straightforward and rich enough. The Bride's 'origin' is actually the main source of humor in the film, what with Pai-Mei, a parody of Chinese martial artists of the past. The film is not overly dark, and scenes like the Bride's encounter with her supposedly dead daughter are surprisingly poignant among other violent or light scenes.
The acting is stellar, but this time, Uma Thurman has a rival for best performance in David Carradine as Bill. The 70's TV icon delivers a magnificent performance brimming with cool and dashes of humor too. His acting further strengthens the feeling that Bill oddly enough isn't all that bad. He just ""overreacted.""
The music is what really helps the movie's mediocre story. One piece, ""A Silhouette of Doom,"" played in the teaser trailer, is absolutely incredible and builds up tension twice in the film. They just fit so well to each scene; they feel so right.
As usual, Quentin has a couple of directorial tricks to show you, but, unlike Volume 1, happily enough, these seem to stem from his own imagination. The action scenes are FAST but BRIEF especially Bill's, which was a huge let-down. The quality of these are subpar, but the one that takes the cake is the showdown with Elle Driver.
All in all, this is a satisfying conclusion for Kill Bill and for those really waiting for this, it won't be as big a let-down as The Matrix Revolutions was for me (and many, many people).
Oh and one last thing: DO NOT STAY AFTER THE 12-MINUTE CREDITS. The little thing at the end is merely a stupid eye-picking scene from Volume 1. It's nothing that enhances the story. Don't waste your time.",1082073600,2,3212,4.626970227670753
1418117,4,B00005AQ65,"I saw Kill Bill vol 1 a few weeks after its release.  I had heard that the studio didn't want it to be released as Tarantino wanted (over three hours long).  I went to the see the film with the girl I was dating and another couple.  After the film, all four of us agreed we wanted to see Kill Bill vol 2 right now.  I mean the first film should not have even been called Kill Bill, it should have been called, Bride Killer or something, I mean all we hear in the film is Bill's voice.  Now this is not to say I didn't enjoy the film, I did, however it left me feeling like one of the season ending TV cliffhangers.  Now the studio claims it did not want to release a movie that long.....Gone with the Wind was nearly four hours long and that didn't stop people from going to see it in record numbers.  Hell, Titantic was 3 hours and 20 minutes I saw that thing twice at the movie theather.  I don't know what the studio was thinking. To be honest, I was looking forward to seeing Kill Bill II, but it has been so long since the first part I really lost some desire for it.  As for the Kill Bill vol 1 dvd, don't bother, just wait for the directors cut when the movie can be seen how it was ment to be seen",1081900800,4,1205,3.946280991735537
1418118,5,B00005AQ65,"""Kill Bill, Vol. 2,"" which I saw in a sneak preview last night, is exactly the way you want it to be. It's overtly stylized, violent, interesting and filled with cliffhangers and obscure movie references. It also holds the answers you seek in the story and contains some great dialogue and acting.
Uma Thurman's character of The Bride is given a name and fleshed out so that she becomes more of a human being and less of a single-minded killing machine. Keith Carradine's Bill is given a face, several great speeches and a personality that is both charming and frightening. Daryl Hannah gives a career-best performance, frankly, as the jealous, scary Elle Driver. And Michael Madsen creates Budd as a killer more world-weary than scary. Oh, and Gordon Liu's performance as Pei Mai is very funny.
""Vol. 2"" is as good as the first one, which was very good, but ""Vol. 2"" is great in a completely different way. It has dialogue, emotion and depth. The full weight that the story carries becomes apparent in ""Vol. 2,"" and Carradine and Thurman have some great scenes.
The two halves of ""Kill Bill"" are so different, in fact, that it's difficult for me to imagine them together.
They're both stand-alone masterpieces.
And I suppose that's about the best compliment I can give this.",1081900800,14,1275,4.773755656108597
1418119,4,B00005AQ65,"OKAY. The second part of the movie does not come out until the 16th of April, and here it is the 13th, and i've already read two amazon reviews from people who have claimed to have seen the second part already, which leads me to believe that many of the five star reviews on amazon are made up and submitted by publicists. I loved Volume One, but am giving it only four stars instead of five due to the fact that some scenes could have been edited down a bit. Other than that, i really enjoyed it and will be looking forward to seeing Volume 2 in the theatres. I read all the one star reviews this afternoon for the movie and so i watched it with very low expectations. I was expecting a totally horrible movie, but was surprised how much i enjoyed it. It lived up to the hype. Believe me there  are hundreds of films out there much worse than Kill Bill. If you look at this film from the point that it's a tribute to the excessive over-the-top Japanese exploitation martial arts movies of the 70s and 80s then you will enjoy it. Don't take this movie seriously and you will love it. Don't analyze this movie too much. Just sit back and watch it. Most of those movies had little character development, and we all know the reason to watch those movies was for the fight scenes and violence. Well it's the same here. With little character development and big on the blood and fight scenes, it's a perfect tribute to a genre.",1081814400,2,1422,4.3059701492537314
1418120,5,B00005AQ65,"Not much to say it's a Tarentino flick, you just can't get any better. This one is supposed to be more brutal, than the ass wippons that Uma gave in Vol. 1. In Vol. 2 you will see more of Uma dramaticaly. Now from the recent preview's it will be 10 times better than Vol. 1 and i know it will be. So be sure to see Uma return as the Bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2.",1081641600,,359,3.675324675324675
1418121,5,B00005AQ65,"The movie is the celebration of the joy of filmmaking. The movie is filmmaking in its purest form. All of the plotline turns, all of the characters, down to the tiniest details, all of the background soundtrack sounds seem to be integral parts of collective movie memories.
The extraordinary thing is that Tarantino manages to put these archetypal shots together with an incredible taste and perfect timing.
The casting in the movie is also great. The actors do a great job at staying serious while doing the goofiest things imaginable.
Tarantino's dialogue sparkles with wit and humor, as usual.
I can't wait for the Director's Cut DVD to see the whole movie like the director intended it to be.  Until then, get the two volumes by all means and have yourself a one-movie moviefest.",1081296000,6,783,4.843283582089552
1418122,5,B00005AQ65,"I was lucky last year in that I got to see Kill Bill volume 1 weeks before it was released last year.  I thought it was one of the greatest things I've ever seen on film and went on to see it eight times in theaters. I even chose it as the best film of 2003. Surpassing even the mighty Lord of the Rings.  Something I thought would never happen. Me being a big Lord of the Rings fan.
So with such high praise for volume 1 my hopes were very high for volume 2. And it more than delivers.  Where volume 1 focused more on the action and was fast paced. This one is at a slower pace and is more dialogue driven. Which is what Tarantino does best anyway.  At approximately two and a half hours it is also a lot longer than the first one. Don't worry though Kill Bill volume 2 is not without it's share with great fight scenes and memorable new characters. The most memorable is Pei Mei the martial arts master who trained the bride and the other members of the Dead Viper Assassination Squad. Played wonderfully by Gordon Liu (who also played Johnny Mo in volume 1) Pei Mei even over shadows the mighty Hattori Hanzo played by Sonny Chiba in volume 1.
Other memorable performances come from Michael Madsen as Budd a.k.a Sidewinder and David Carradine as Bill. Madsen gives another Mr. Blonde caliber performance as the former assassin turned trailer park alcoholic. Claustrophobics take caution the confrontation between Budd and the Bride is really intense and very claustrophobic. Darryl Hannah is deliciously evil as Elle Driver. She's about as evil as can be. What should be noted is the fight between Elle and the Bride. What is unquestionably one of the most knock down, drag out, intense fights ever put to film. Tarantino pulls no punches here. Huge credit should once again be given to the sound department on this one. You can almost feel ever blow. It is the best fight in the whole of Kill Bill.
Never seen and only heard in volume 1 we finally get to see the performance we've been waiting for. David Carradine is of course great in the title role. He plays the role with such a laid back ease. Both intimidating and cool. You don't know whether to sympathize with the guy or hate him.
Those who said Uma Thurman deserved an Oscar nomination last year will probably say the same thing this year and then some. Where Thurman was praised for the intense action in volume 1, in this one she really goes all out. No longer a nameless assassin out for revenge she is now with a name (to be revealed in the film) and is now seen more as a person then a nameless killer. Not that the nameless killer thing was a bad thing. It was a great action role. This time the emotions come out. Thurman really lets herself go in the emotional scenes. Well worthy of a nomination.
So is Kill Bill volume 2 a worthy conclusion? Absolutely. Is it as action packed as volume 1? No. But that's not a bad thing because we get more of the great Tarantino dialogue. Was there anything I found wrong with the film?  Well, there was one little thing. The credits go on forever. So if your like me and you like to sit through the credits you've been warned. Kill Bill volume 2 will not be without it's enemies. Those who didn't like volume 1 will probably not enjoy this one. If you're a fan of volume 1 then you should be more then satisfied.

It was one of the best films of 2003.  Althou, very graphic and gory through out, it still is top notch entertainment.  Uma Thurman is great.  This is gonna be a box office hit.  This is once again, a prediction, but what can I say, it looks like a good movie.  Great acting, great plot and great affects.  And, just to tell everyone, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is coming out on dvd some time in April.  I think in the 20th's.  SO mark your calender for the date of this when it hits theatre's, and the first film when it hit's shelfs.  If you want to know the date, just look it up here at amazon.

1418124,5,B00005AQ65,"Okay. If you want to know what this film is all about (for those living under a rock for the last year), then please read the absolutely stirring review by musicfan232 above. Actually, it's a damn good review and one of the best I've seen on Amazon. Congratulations man. However, I offer a little taste on why you should see this film IMMEDIATELY if you haven't already.

Those who know me at all know that I love movies. I love good, thought-provoking, but still entertaining films that I can waste way too much money on at Best Buy and see again and again. However, trilogies and quadriligies, and whatever else they come up with, seem to grab my attention the most. The story is established in the first, expanded in the second, and climaxes in the third or fourth or whatever. Then again, I also enjoy especially longer films, the big epics where so much happens that you may literally spend all day with your butt glued and your eyes glazed. Ben Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, Seven Samurai, all longer than John Holmes' unmentionable on lady's night, but with the right kind of movie watching endurance, one could even sit through the full edition of Das Boot. The point of all this vast avalanche of b******* is that the movie was originally supposed to be one full film that may have very well been the next Pulp Fiction, but there was the marketing and I have finally forgiven Miramax for it, but watch this film as one big one. Don't watch the credits until the VERY end, and forget about Vol. 2's introduction. It's one hell of a movie experience. (Granted, most people who say they don't like it say so because it was a big disappointment. I can see why, especially when in the original screenplay Bill and the Bride DO have a swordfight on the very beautiful moon-lit beach. That would've tied this off as an instant classic, but Tarantino was under a lot of pressure.)

Yet as fun and amazingly cool as the fight sequences are (especially with Elle in the camper and O-Ren in the garden), I am very much looking forward to a Director's Cut DVD edition, complete with ALL of the trailers, maybe some extended interviews, maybe a commentary but I wouldn't count on it, and a collector's edition case with stunning art work. Now while this is just wishful thinking, Tarantino of all people deserves at least one Director's Cut of something. (...)

That, and this is Tarantino's work. Come on, who can't love the guy? This is technically only the fourth film he's done and anything else he's sold off has turned to crap, but in his own hands Tarantino can sculpt a masterpiece. In case you don't know him, here are his own works (and please, don't settle for anything other than these):

Reservoir Dogs: His first ""feature"", a little Independent film but still a cool Crime Drama that will never let you look at your own ears the same way again.

Pulp Fiction: The one film that secured Quentin as a legend. Still his best work and, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.

Jackie Brown: A follow-up piece to Fiction with Blaxploitation written all over it.

Kill Bill: Well, you know.

Inglorious Bastards: Tarantino's next project, should be coming out in a couple of years, he's VERY serious about making this one. From Tarantino.info, he says that this will be to WWII what The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was to the Civil War. Wow.

Kill Bill Vol. 3: When I first heard about this, I thought he was joking. Instead, he says that if he was backed well enough, then he may do it. HOW? Well, obviously a slightly different route would be taken, but who knows.

You can take this as a continuation, you can take it as a sequel (but shame on you), or you can do the right thing and take this as a complete four-and-a-half hour epic. Now that Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 are available for sale, you can see both in their theatrical entirety. I'd highly recommend that you find some time to clear your busy schedule, spend around forty dollars for the set, (I'd recommend Best Buy, but it's your choice, and Amazon.com works good too) and see one of the best Action/Drama films ever made.",1077062400,2,4093,4.518918918918919
1418125,5,B00005AQ65,"We're talking about Kill Bill Vol. I - As many have said, Tarantino has a unique style that most would agree is based on his play on story-line chronology. In this he is genius. The facts are that he has studied both asian martial arts movies and Japanese anime for this film, resultingin an aesthetic that is unique to western film. There are literally no slow scenes in this first film. There are so many unexpected laughs, you find yourself surprised because everything is drenched in blood. This is another device Tarantino is masterful in application: desensitization through excess. He uses ecessive blood shed to distance us from the real horror of all the murder that is taking place. We are invited into an underworld of assassins and this is their lifestyle. Because they are immune to this level of bloodshed, we, as viewers, must also become immune, and Tarantino succeeds in this. Excess in this manner works, and we can watch the film wide eyed and still root for our heroine as she slices the bad mobsters to pieces, despite the gallons of spraying blood. This, people, is worthy of many academy awards, however, Quentin will never see one for his work as long as he forces us to think outside the box, which, in this case, is inside a comic book. This is a visual masterpiece with a lot of unique psychological twists within a very familiar plot. You will learn about samuri culture and what James Bond has gone through, but has never been cleared to tell. Uma Thurman and Lucy Lu (sp?) are fantastic! There is an anime sequence mid-film that is blendedinto the motion picture perfectly. Kudos. This is one to own.",1076976000,3,1630,4.682926829268292

She has played done a great job preparing for her role physically and mentally. It has to be hard to play any of Tarintino's roles. I aslo give credit to the rest of the bunch including Daryl, Lucy, David, Vivica and Michal.
