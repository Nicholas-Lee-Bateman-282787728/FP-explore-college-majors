8128812,1,B000G24ROW,"Listen, I bought this VHS for $17 and I was extremely willing to pay that much money for a VHS celebrating the life of Nora lam (one of my favorite people). Understand this, that no one in their right mind should pay $17  for a VHS but I did and was willing too under the idea that it would be a 30 minute to an hour long movie. BUT BE WARNED THIS VHS IS 6-MINUTES-LONG! 6 lousy minutes.....this is absurd but it's true. So don't waste your money unless you find this VHS about Nora Lam for under a $1. I was so dissapointed because I love Nora Lam and I wanted to see a movie celebrating her ministry but this absolutely does not! If I was given the wrong VHS or maybe mine has a glich in it please someone contact me...but until told otherwise and mine VHS is correct then this movie really is 6-minutes-long.",1169424000,,811,4.165605095541402
