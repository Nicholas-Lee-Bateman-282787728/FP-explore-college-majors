You get a terrific high def transfer of the movie in its original aspect ratio and a nice selection of extras.  The extras include a director's commentary, a rare making-of doc, an isolated score and some amazing audition footage.  A booklet is also included to round out the package.

The movie itself features some amateurish acting and a screenplay that has a tendency to meander, but that's okay!  This movie is like vicariously experiencing an amazing vacation in the Greek isles with a bunch of hot young people and some gorgeous views.  It's definitely a product of its time, and it could only have been made in the early eighties.  It manages the feat of being sensual without being raunchy.

His girlfriend Cathy (Daryl Hannah) is the jealous type, but she is about to overcome that in unexpected ways.

The movie is sexy, sensual and tasteful. Be prepared for naked beaches. It is really a coming of age story and interesting to see how these young people all develop their sense of identity and self esteem. The acting is a bit forced at times, but overall the movie flows and there are some really funny moments.  Fantastic cinematography will make you want to pack your bags and head for Greece.

What is 'love', what is a 'family', how should we love and how do we define ourselves and our relationships?

1079970,2,6305812233,"<strong>Summer Lovers</strong> (Randal Kleiser, 1982)

Back in the dark ages, when we had just moved (I can't remember where we had moved from or moved to; we did a lot of that sort of thing in the early eighties), my parents got this amazing new technology called cable television, and as a side perk they got a pay service called Home Box Office, which at the time was still a relatively young upstart. To say my preteen world was instantly changed would be an understatement. Those first few months with HBO changed the way I looked at the world of film (and the way I consumed film; I lost count within a week or two of the number of times I watched <em>Hangar 18</em> and <em>The Return</em>). I, a suburban pre-teen who was absurdly grateful to have been able to catch such seemingly-obscure movies as <em>Phantasm</em> and <em>Deathsport</em> at the local multiplex just a few years before, was suddenly introduced to a whole world of foreign films, obscure classics, B movies... and sex films. Not in the sense of porn, or in the sense of softcore (a subgenre which I am convinced sprung up solely to serve the pay movie channel market), but movies that had sex as a main theme. Talk about horizon-broadening for someone who grew up in a sexually repressed household. When the parents were asleep, I'd sneak down to the living room and catch late-night screenings of movies like <em>Personal Best</em> and <em>Making Love</em>. Eventually, of course, the parents caught on and stopped me from doing such things, but I could still read the movie descriptions in the guide and fantasize. <em>Summer Lovers</em> hit HBO right around that time, and when you're thirteen years old and popping with hormonal activity, reading a movie description about a Greek vacation that involves a guy and <em>two</em> lovely ladies getting up to all kinds of wicked fun was fodder for years of fantasies. When I finally got a chance to watch the movie, thirty years had passed. To say my fantasies had done it better was an understatement on a level of magnitude I'm not sure I can put into words.

Plot: Michael Pappas (<em>sex, lies, and videotape</em>'s Peter Gallagher in his second feature) and his nave-but-horny girlfriend Cathy Featherstone (Daryl Hannah, who also appeared in <em>Bladerunner</em> the same year) head to Greece, Michael's homeland, for a summer vacation filled with nude beaches, liquor, and badly-played acoustic guitar. All is going well until Michael becomes obsessed with Lina (<em>Bolero</em>'s Val&eacute;rie Quennessen in her final feature), a French archaeologist on the island for the summer to assist in a local dig. Needless to say in the pre-AIDS world of casual encounters, Michael and Lina wind up in bed, there is some hair-tearing by both Michael and Cathy when he confesses, and she decides to play the open relationship game as well. But none of the island guys, all of whom come off as brash (though beautifully tanned, natch), do it for her. And she winds up confronting Lina...

The first, and biggest, complaint I have: all of this is set to one of the worst soundtracks I have come across in recent memory, all awful treacly American pop I can't imagine the native folk on a small island in a country famous for its music would allow anywhere <em>near</em> its borders (we're talking about the worst excesses of Chicago, the Pointer Sisters, etc.). I have read a review or two that calls the soundtrack ""intrusive"". I commend the reviewers on their restraint. When you get to the final scene and see what Kleiser does with the music there, you will find yourself with the conflicting urges to vomit and laugh hysterically. Don't do both simultaneously, that could be fatal.

Second: for a movie that put itself out there as transgressive, not that anyone had heard that term in 1982 but it fits, it's almost unbearably restrained. Most notably, while it is implied during the first couple of meetings between Cathy and Lina that the two of them have jumped into bed at least once, every time there is some sort of contact that would seem to naturally involve all three of them, Kleiser (who also wrote the script) shies away, instead having two of our participants kick things off while the third watches (with Michael always being one of the two)--and while I could understand and forgive this based on the mores of Hollywood at the time were Kleiser to even feint in the direction of ""we gave you a polyamorous relationship, we'll at least give you leads towards imagining these folks in a threesome"", nope, we never get it. None of the relationship movies <em>any</em> of our three principals makes in the movie makes a damn bit of sense, not only as realistic life choices, but more confusingly, even as the fevered imaginations of a teenaged boy (or a middle-aged scriptwriter)!

All that said, there are a few scenes here that, while not making the movie worth watching, are arresting in some way, either visually (Michael's first visit to a nude beach with Lena, where he not-so-idly pours a trail of sand and gravel from her navel to her breasts in delicious close-up) or conceptually (Cathy's mother and her best friend pay a surprise visit to the island and try to process everything they witness with highly amusing results). If you stumble onto the movie and decide to watch it, these are what you will take away with you... which is a far cry from what you probably <em>think</em> you will take away with you. * ",1335484800,,5463,4.824973319103522

If you've never taken a long vacation abroad, this movie will surely inspire fantasies of a romantic tryst abroad.

The island of Santorini plays a character itself. You can't help but appreciate the unique, uncommon beauty of the island throughout the film.

1079974,5,6305812233,"It's amazing how they can fit months into a 99 minute movie and make it feel right.

I first watched this film on cable back in the 1980s nearly 30 years ago.  It has held up amazingly well and I somewhat miss that age we went through when things were very romantic and also very sexual.  There is a key moment about a half an hour into the film that required very good writing and very good acting to walk the line from an affair into a more complex relationship.

It turns on the women meeting and not hating each other yet still going through very realistic struggles with jealously and hurt.

Despite the short length of the movie, everything in the movie has a well paced feeling and never seems rushed or ""just so"" or ""the characters do this because the writer wants them to"".

Nudity in the movie is extensive and the theme should be highly erotic but the movie plays like a love story instead.  Today- people seem focused on sex to the exclusion of emotion.  As they say in the movie, it's very hard to connect to people- to actually get to know them.  Summer Lovers takes the time to get to know the people, develop them, and connect with the audience.

The architecture is unique to the world as is the rocky cliffs.  I wonder to this day what Daryl Hannah would say about her cliff jump with the others.  Was it terrifying?  Does she still remember it?",1310169600,,1363,4.339920948616601
1079975,4,6305812233,"1082s ""Summer Lovers"" offers delights on several levels. Among them is the oft-naked, 21-year-old Daryl Hannah at her most transparent and gamin, in one of her first films. It has an authentic, unforced feel of the transitory communities of young trekkers who annually flood low-key paradises around the world. It's straightforward and unpretentious, taking in the  laid-back nudity on Greek beaches without a trace of prurience.

Its greatest delight may be watching the incubation of a rich, textured, shy first-time threesome presented without the sexual pathology usually required in American films. It's sufficiently dramatic to keep you engaged, but never over-the-top or ugly. It feels real.

Despite the erotic saturation, if you need graphic sex, you won't find it here. The lovemaking, by two or by three, is fully present but lightly handled. Another erotic element may surprise you by its absence: despite the intense connection that develops between Cathy and Lina, the film shys away from showing any same-sex sex. Was this needed to get it by the censors (it's rather amazing that it did)? Or was it just a thoughtless hangover of the male-centeredness of the 60s? I have no idea, but you get to know these three characters well enough that you'll have little trouble extrapolating your own fantasies of their couplings.

As interesting as the film itself are the range of reviews you'll find, here and elsewhere. ""Summer Lovers"" pushes a LOT of buttons, positive and negative, by being so honest about things that are rarely dealt with honestly in film. It has a cult following of people who've watched it dozens of times over the decades and made pilgrimage to Santorini. And it has many, many reviewers who have to tell you, obsessively and perhaps self-protectively, how shallow it is.

Don't believe them. This isn't Shakespeare. But it IS an honest, unmannered portrait of three ordinary, beautiful young people falling in love in a slightly unorthodox way.

I am not a huge fan of Peter Gallagher, but his character Michael Pappas pulls off every guy's dream of getting his girlfriend to approve of him fooling around with another woman. Daryl Hannah is his American girlfriend Cathy who is looking to grow, become more open and sexually move away from her ""nice girl"" persona in Santorini. Val&eacute;rie Quennessen is the lovely other woman Lina who eventually moves in with Michael and Cathy at their villa just across the way from hers. The sunsets and vistas are killer at both villas.

The director, Randal Kleiser also directed ""The Blue Lagoon"" - which is another beautiful film that can also be appreciated without sound. This film is not deep, but it is great to look at and good, light entertainment.",1266710400,2,1107,4.701030927835052

Michael (Peter Gallagher) and Cathy (Daryl Hannah) are childhood sweethearts.  They have decided to go to a small Greek island for the summer.  The location is exotic and makes the couple feel much freer than they normally would be.  Then enter Lina (Valerie Quennesen) a beautiful French archeologist.  Michael is taken by Lina but is with Cathy. Cathy meets Lina and they find that they have something in common.  The three become a trio.  Everything is going great until Cathy's mother (Barbara Rush) and good friend Barbara (Barbara Cook).  This makes Lina think about the relationship and she decides to end it.  Without Lina, Michael and Cathy decide to end their vacation.

This movie is beautiful. The cinematography by Dimitri Papaconstandis and Timothy Galfas is breathtaking.  Director Randall Kleiser makes visual films in exotic locations.  Yes the screenplay is slight but some films the visual is enough.  And this is one of those films.  Just sit back and enjoy!

Anyway this film is really about friendship more so than about sex between a man and two beautiful women.  Peter Gallagher is a great actor, I wish he was in more films today, he should be on the so called a lists.

Anyway when I finally went to Crete and Santorini in Aug 1990 and again 1991 it was even more beautiful than I thought. and so were the women.

As Darryl Hannah's naked preview to ""Splash"", she can be found splashing around in clear blue Ionian waters with her boyfriend (played by handsome Peter Gallagher) and his new French, female lover who lives and works in Greece and becomes part of their existing relationship. (Yes, clearly liberal European values here, as all three of them also splash around in olive oil, champagne and the villa waterbed!)
Beautiful scenery of the Greek Isles, local sights, and ruins, as well as examples of westernized post-hippie 70's culture of nightclubs and Greek social life. Romantic, dramatic, light-hearted and fun for most responsible young adults and older adults who just want to watch a culturally entertaining movie. There's even a surprise visit by the mother who comes to check up on her daughter during her own vacation to the Greek Isles, as she witnesses the residual existence of these strange, yet humorous behaviors.
Cultural nuances and nudity; intense look at deep, yet adventurous relationships and positive ways to deal with deep feelings that rule many human sexual behaviors.

1080138,3,6305812233,"I first watched Summer Lovers on HBO late at night back in the mid-eighties and for me it represented what many young people with over active imaginations stuck in boring small towns spend much of thier lives daydreaming about(or at least I did), adventures in exotic far-off lands and young, foreign, uninhibited, women who seem to wander through thier days naked, or about to get naked, or having sex.

  The premise is simple enough. Young college students, Michael(Peter Gallahger) and Kathy(Daryl Hannah) fly to the Greek isle of Santorini to spend thier summer vacation. The couple are for the most part sexually naive and inexperienced and find the more liberal European openess about sexuality and what it offers them questioning thier monogamy.

  Michael sneaks away to a nude beach where he encounters a mysterious French girl Lena(Valerie Quinnesen) and they begin sleeping together. When Michael reveals this to Kathy she is at first angry, then once she meets Lena she becomes infatuated and the three begin sharing a bed together.

  At this point Summer Lovers has established all the required elements of truly great erotic films. Gorgeous setting, delicous young actors in thier prime, and taboo subject matter.

  Unfortunatly the film falls apart and doesn't live up to it's potential. Once the three begin living together in bliss the only dimension of thier relationship the script is brave enough to illuminate is how attractive thier bodies look strolling down the beach, getting in and out of bed, sharing the same bathroom mirror while brushing thier teeth, and wearing various skimpy outfits while early eighties music plays in the backround.

  The story is really that shallow. As for the sex, for a film that is billed as eroticism there is no actual sex anywhere to be seen. The sex is implied rather than stated. Just as the audience's pecidillos are aroused by a promising set-up the director cuts away to the next scene giving us nothing to get excited about.

  I think the role of erotic films has always been to force the audience to confront thier sexuality and conventional sensibilities and question them or at least provide escapist fantasy for a couple of hours from the realties of modern life.

Summer lovers acomplishes neither.

 As a pre-teen Summer Lovers romanticised the mysteries of sex and eroticism for me. Now, in my thirties, sex is not such a mystery and the eroticism that surrounds it, while exciting, is often messy and complex.

  I bought the DVD because of the nostalgia the film has for me. If you saw the film back in the eighties you should pick-up a copy and watch it like I do, late at night when your in the mood for something frivolous.

  After twenty years the Greek scenary still looks incredible. The DVD has no extras. No commentary, no deleted scenes, nothing. There are some reasons for this. Daryl Hannah referred to the film in an interview as a ""dumb little movie"".  The film was so heavily panned by critics the director probably wants nothing nothing to do with it. And Peter Gallahger, now enjoying fame on primetime televsion doesn't want the world seeing his ""little"" full frontal nude scene.

  I was saddened when i learned recently the actress who played Lena, Valerie Quinnesen(I know I'm not spelling that right) died in a car wreck. She was the most interesting person in the film.

1080139,3,6305812233,"The scenery may make it worthwhile to hang in past the lightweight dialogue and vague storyline. Beautiful scenes of the old hillside houses and the lustrous Greek sea and sky saturate the screen. Lots of opportunities for the main characters to loll about on the beach sans clothing, snuggle in bed sans clothing, and romp in the ocean sans clothing. Wait for it on television, as I doubt you will want to watch it more than once unless you are really desperate to see bare bodies.

I actually liked the two female characters, but felt the young man mainly stood around striking a pose and showing off his manly physique and Greek eyebrows. The two young women at least interacted enough to develop personalities that you could relate to.

I'd like to see a little more dialogue about the three-way relationship and fewer of the sappy scenes like the birthday party which ended with all doused in olive oil and champagne. The sex scenes involved mostly snuggling with the rest left to your imagination.

I guess there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours than to watch this.",1119312000,3,1079,4.668421052631579

Who could believe there was anyone so beautiful, so interesting and so available, in such a place?  I must have dozed off during many of the love scenes, but with my interest in archaeology and history, I locked in on the scenes of her working in the excavations.

Now that I am planning a trip to Athens and Thera (Santorini) with my brother and cousin, I ordered copies of the DVD and watched it again for the first time in its entirety.  Even at my advanced age, I was amazed that the nudity and the plot actually got into a movie.

The clarity of the DVD is great, and with the spectacular scenery, it is too beautiful to pass up.  I have faith that a version will be issued which recaptures the wider aspect ratio, and I will be waiting to buy it.  I am forwarding the copies I  bought to Ray and Bill, as part of the preparation for our trip in the Fall of 2004.  Can you imagine what it will be like for three guys over 65 trying to get up and down those steep walkways where the actors scampered, each of us thinking how it might be if we could meet our own dream girl.

I ""googled"" Valerie Quennessen hoping to find out what she is doing now, and ended up reading all the other reviews on Amazon, including the reports her passing.  That has to be one of the more regrettable events of the 20th century, but the great thing is that this movie was made, and that she made it so memorable.

Another relative reported that the excavations at Akrotiri were closed last year for improvements in preparation for the Olympics, but that important finds were on view in museums on the island and back in Athens.  I hope that the site is open for tourists now that the Olympics are over.  The possibility still stands that destruction at Thera is truly the origin for Homer's legend of Atlantis.

Michael (Peter Gallagher) and Cathy (Daryl Hannah) are on a Summer vacation after college graduation and his father's death, and are apparently headed for engagement and marriage. Michael encounters and is uncontrollably drawn to Lina (Valerie Quennessen), a French Archeologist working at a dig nearby.
What follows is a light but well handled exploration of the complications that ensue when passion and love collide with society's rules and expectations. What could have easily ended up as just another shallow movie sex romp actually does some justice to the theme of adults exploring new relationship territory and the power of overcoming one's barriers. Although lighter and not in the same league as ""Same Time Next Year,"" it is still a good movie and a fun but somewhat thoughtful look at unusual relationships. It does not follow the expected Hollywood pattern, and I like that. (Can't say more without spoiling it.) I disagree that it is bubble-brained and predictable. The story isn't any sillier than the plot of Casablanca or the Wizard of Oz, just not quite the same caliber.
The story is well told, dialog is okay, and the characters are believable. The scenery is gorgeous and well photographed, and the film is much more enjoyable on DVD than it was when I first saw it on cable and on VHS. The details in the scenes and sound track are much better. I caught much more subtlety in the photography on the DVD. I loved the footage of the beautiful whitewashed Greek buildings and the ocean. There are nude beach scenes and some other nudity, but it is relevant to the time, location, and situations of the characters. This is a love story about sexy young people on vacation in the Mediterranean, after all. The sound track is late 70s to early 80s pop (Prince, Tina Turner, Pointer Sisters, etc.), but good songs that drive the story. There are no real extras on the DVD, and I would have enjoyed at least some commentary from the actors or director about the film and its theme, shooting on Santorini, etc. There was apparently a ""Making of"" documentary done for TV, and that would be a nice addition. Since Valerie Quennessen is dead, something extra about her would be nice. I agree that she is the most interesting in the cast. Her passing is indeed sad. (She also had a small role in Conan The Barbarian, by the way.)
I especially like one line where Hannah remarks that she had a dream where she was a mermaid. This movie was released  in 1982 and Splash (with Hannah as a mermaid!) in 1984. Interesting.

To be frank, ""Summer Lovers"" can be rather cheesy at times (a Sundance winner this is not). Still, the storyline and the setting make this an enjoyable capturing of a moment in time for three people on Santorini during one eventful summer.

Longtime unmarried lovers Michael and Kathy, taking a break after graduating from college, travel to Santorini, where both their rigid American upbringing and their longtime love is challenged. Michael and Kathy find themselves, and their perceptions of life and love, questioned by the free and open European approach to the natural draws of the flesh. The two even discuss their sex lives, including fantasies, in a way it seems they had never done before. Eventually, their relationship meets challenge in the flesh -- the intelligent and forthright Lena.

One thing leads to another and Michael, Kathy, and Lena find themselves in love. This is a total twist from what might be expected, as the American portrayal of the menage e trois is almost always depicted as a manipulated scheme to sexually benefit the male.

The final scene is touching, and many otherwise narrow Americans may find themselves moved at the sight of these young lovers taking a chance and leaping into their feelings, despite convention.",1044230400,8,1403,5.064935064935065

1080224,5,6305812233,"I never knew about this movie until the Summer of 1987 when I saw the video cover in a local video rental store.  I had gone to Santorini in 1981 and spent 3 weeks there exploring it alone.  The movie brought back many memories and I thought the portrayal of life on Santorini was very accurate.  I admit I did not have a three-way while there, but I enjoyed it none-the-less!
It was only recently that I discovered that Valerie Quennessen had passed away from an automobile accident.  I found her to be the life of the movie and thought her beauty was unbelievable.  One of her great lines was ""Jealousy doesn't prove how much you love someone, it proves how insecure you are - Margaret Mead: I think I have that book here somewhere""  At that time (1987) I found myself healing from a broken relationship and somehow that line of Lena's made me understand a lot.
I had been to Akrotiri and Perissa Beach while visiting and found the film captured the feeling one gets when you are actually there.  Unlike a couple of reviewers who were so disgusted about the nudity in the film, I thougt it was done with accuracy and in good taste.  Europeans don't have the same hangups that we Americans do about our bodies. I applaud the director for not 'Americanizing' the film.
Overall, it was a great reminder of my Summer in Santorini and I now occasionally watch the video when I am wanting to escape the day-to-day trials.  It's a great video for escape and discovering yourself and life.
Should you ever have the chance to visit Santorini, GO and HAVE the BEST time of your life!",1029801600,76,1575,4.479020979020979
1080225,5,6305812233,...summer lovers is a wild ride to a place all young men wish they could be. it does have a weird twist but you must understand were the young man is coming from. he excited that he meets a woman of mystery and wants to explore those feelings. its not that he doesnt love his girlfriend but he want to exscape from his so called planned life. i could related to this whole movie in many ways! the music is fantastic and brings back many beach moments. for young love i rate this movie very high in my book...,1022284800,6,508,4.141414141414141
1080292,1,6305812233,"Okay - perhaps it's just because I've never been to Greece for a summer vacation, but I just don't *get* this movie or why there are actually  people out there who have enjoyed it.
The plot of this movie is so  preposterous that the only reason I kept watching until the end was because  I was hoping for some twist in the storyline that would salvage the film.  Alas, the ending of the film was even worse than what I was anticipating  halfway through.  (C'mon - Lina on a moped at the end?  ""Yes, I'd  like my movie with extra extra cheese, please."")
The only thing that  made this film barable (barely!) was the scenery of the Greek Isles - which  I admit was captured beautifully.  (There's a lot of good early 80's-style  nudity too if you like that kinda thing.)  As for the story and the  characters...
The worst flick I've seen in a while.",967161600,5,847,4.346153846153846
1080293,5,6305812233,"I admit that, as many of the above reviewers have stated, this is a guilty pleasure flick for all time!  It is also more addictive than crack and higher on the eye-candy quotient than even the most shameless episode of  'Baywatch'! During the winter time I fall into a seasonal depression which  I treat with a steady diet of dumb California beach movies, but this  adventure in the Greek islands is the one that warms my soul the most! One  can only guess if Daryl Hannah and Peter Gallagher are aware that this  beach romp from early in both of their careers actually does have a cult  following! This is a fun movie, period.  Aaron Spelling once said (to his  regret) that television is ""cotton candy for the mind"".  As well  it should be I say, even moreso!  'Summer Lovers' is cotton candy for the  mind in the form of a feature film, and there should be more like it as  well!",954374400,6,882,4.364197530864198
1080294,5,6305812233,"Summer lovers, actually one of the best movies I have ever seen. After seeing this movie about 30 times, i still smile from ear to ear when Michael, Cathy and Lina dances to the great disco hit; Your love, by Lime.  The magic of the movie is made by the music and ofcourse the beautifull  views of santorini. one thing though, why isn't the soundtrack possible to  get. It has been sold in stores back in the days, but has probably gone out  of production. This would be the best collection of 80's music ever to be  collected on one cd.

1080295,5,6305812233,"I watched this movie 50 times while pent up in a Coast Guard Station in the North Sea duing the winter time. People from all over the island would come over and watch the daily viewing, which actually became sum what of a  ritual. A few years later I traveled to Greece to visit the different  places I saw in the movie and remembered so fondly. I was not at all  disapointed. Greece is a beautiful country full of pleasent people full of  great ruins of past cultures. I thank the director of this movie for making  such a well thought out love triad done in the upmost of plesentries. I  highly recommend the movie, the country, and of couse the threesomes.",947548800,29,659,4.360655737704918

Beautiful scenary of Greece, good concept, pushing the envelope in  the early 80's.

1080297,5,6305812233,This is a great movie for those willing to throw caution to the wind and go for a ride. At first I was into it for the funky love-triangle. I wanted to see how it would turn out. As it progressed I found that I was paying  less attention to the sexual aspects of the film and ended up lost in the  eyes of Valrie Quennessen. Without a doubtm she has the most beautiful  soul I've ever seen in a woman's eyes. THe instant it ended I came to IMDb  to see what else she's done. Then I learned the worst. Valrie died 10  years ago. I genuinely feel a loss in my heart. I must be crazy...I must be  in love.,934848000,12,602,3.8934426229508197

Most movies that show a  threesome has to be a porno or show someone being used and abused... There  are LOTS of happy monogamous triads.  It was very refreshing to finally see  a film not based simply on sex but focused on the friendship/relationship  and such.",927072000,10,455,4.487804878048781

There is topless nudity, but it leaves you not  viewing sex as being sexual but rather quite natural.  It also is a story  of friendship.  This film subsetuently inspired me to travel to the greek  islands (4 times).

My wife says it's a true male fantasy, but what's wrong with that?  Valerie, who died waaaay too young, is absolutely captivating.  A young Darah  Hannah is breath-taking, but fades into the background when sharing the screen with Valerie.  How other stunningly attractive young women would find that  happen to them?

OK, it's pretty lightweight entertainment, but it definitely is entertaining.  I've watched it numerous times and will certainly do so in the future.",1485648000,,606,5.164948453608248

The picture quality is stunning compared to the original release. Better color, better detail definition and it even sounds better. This has always been one of our favorite movies and we're very happy to see it as it was originally meant to be seen by Kleiser and the screen writers. The full beauty of Santorini is shown along with the full beauty of the relationships of the 3 main characters. Very very well done.
