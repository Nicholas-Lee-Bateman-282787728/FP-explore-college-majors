8204734,4,B000S6VFNC,"This disk includes the most basic of exercises and does not have any ""flash"" to it, but having played guitar a few years myself, I can testify that the author is ""right on the money"" when stressing relaxation, breathing and enjoyment of the instrument -- these are extremely important topics and most teachers do not mention this in private lessons  (since who wants to hear about breathing at $50 per hour?)  In addition to the basics, there is a most comprehensive coverage of alzapua, tremolo and a few types of rasqueados.  Excellent disk -- well worth the money.",1190332800,4,567,4.76530612244898
