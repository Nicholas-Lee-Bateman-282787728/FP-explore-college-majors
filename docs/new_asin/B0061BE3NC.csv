8490761,4,B0061BE3NC,"The Body Stealers sits awkwardly between a more or less legit British Sci-Fi film such as Village of Dam*ed (edited in case the filter freaks out) and an episode of Thunderbirds (the British sci-fi puppet show). Get ready for all the 60s style while people attempt to be more or less realistic. Many a stiff upper lip is shown. The film involves a lot of investigation and not much action. Just when you think that things are going to turn into an odd middle brow sci-fi film, our lead is getting it on in the surf with a middle aged woman pretending to be 21 in a sequin mini dress with side cut outs.

Seriously, it's interesting to watch. The actors all look like older respectable middle aged types. You know the way most people in authority look cause they just stuck around the longest. It makes it pretty funny when they stop stiff upper lipping and start going for all the hipping. They seem game but the flesh is weak. Also, the whole concept of parachute users getting abducted mid air is a fun concept. They have some good early sky diving footage too. It's like they combined Point Break with Dr Who.

It's not a great movie. However, if you're into these kinds of movies, you'll have a really good time. I'm glad it's available cause there's not a lot like it.",1472428800,4,1273,4.435897435897436
