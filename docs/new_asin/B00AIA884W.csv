I hope it will be released soon so I can have all five seasons.  It was three years between season three and four.  Please don't wait that long for season five!

5425961,5,B00AIA884W,"It is now 2012 wonder if there is a chance that the Season 5 the Final Season will be released this year. So close yet so far.  I hate to put my hard earned money out for TV Series to get down to one Season left and it not be released.  I have had this happen to many times Flying Nun,Hardy Boys Nancy Drew,Scarecrow and Mrs. King you can now order Season 3 hope they finish up with Season 4 soon then there is several that have only a few Seasons released My 3 Sons,Hope and Faith,Donna Reed,Hazel which they have finally released Season 2 for Pre Order. Why start something and they not finish what is started?  Now I guess we that all have Seasons 1-4 of Charlie's Angels will not have the chance to buy Season 5 because it will not be offered.  I note that you can now order all Seasons of Charlie's Angels
in one setting. It makes me so unhappy over this kind of stuff.

5425962,5,B00AIA884W,"i would really love to have the last of this and i hoping they will release this soon.  it is a shame that it has been over a span of 9 yrs to get all the series to come to dvd.  i am glad to have season 1,2,3 and 4 i want to complete my collection.  there has been so many shows before it and after it to have all their series release.
it is a shame not to have six million dollar man,bionic woman,hogan's family,family matters,alice or etc.
i hope with the new pilot for charlie's angels to come out in the fall with drew barrymore to help produce it will bring out the rest of it.  what i can't seem to understand why is it that they can release all 5 season of charlie's angels on itunes but not finish releasing season 5 on dvd verson.  i think that is such a shame for sony to do that to the fans of a great tv series such as charlie's angels.  season 1 was good and so was season 2 and 3, there were a few good esp. on season 4 and on season 5 but i would like them to get it together and finish what they start.  and now with this new charlie's angels out they should finally finish the last season.
What I don't get is the are going to release this Charlie's Angels reboot on DVD in July of this yr, but not release season 5. Well they are going to now release the whole complete series including season 5 and with in a week for preordering it jump from 46 dollars to 59 dollars that is so unfair and unreal I think I wait till it comes down in price or they release season 5.  I read under Wikipedia of Charlie's Angels season 5 will be release January 1,2013 if that will help",1265846400,25,1587,3.9529780564263324
5425963,5,B00AIA884W,"Well, technically if the show would've survived for a 6th season it may have not done too well with the absence of Jaclyn's character, but possibly have been carried by the right replacement and fan-base of Tanya & Cheryl fans. Now there been alot of speculation and debate on how would S5 be marketed for release? Well, here's my theory, ponder this, Now on a positive note, If Sony is really smart they will figure to tie in a way to market S5 right around the time that the return of the Charlie's Angels re-boot is set to air which is THIS fall season, yes I said THIS fall! I know i'm so excited by this thought that i could just spit! Because realistically, it's not that much longer, and it does make the MOST sense to market it then which could generate better sales for what was the least popular season. But with the return of CA coming back to tv...well, I don't think I have to explain that! Good point huh? so in that perspective there's alot of possibility that we WILL see the release this year!! of course if Sony is just not that bright then i would probably guess we'll be waiting for the release around sometime next year, considering that each dvd set has been released with year gaps. S1-2003, S2-2004, S3-2006 & S4-2009, notice the pattern? each release date is 1yr longer then the previous one (1yr-s2, 2yrs-s3, 3yrs-s4...and so on). which tells me if there is no release this year then we could be waiting till either next year or even...do i dare say it, with a heavy heart...2013!! which would be 1 yr longer than when S4 was released. But let's not think that way till the end of the year! Let's PRAY Sony is smart enough to end our undying anticipation THIS FALL!.....UPDATE***So here we are winding down the year 2012 bracing for 2013. Charlie's Angels Reboot failed miserably in 2011 and was cancelled after only 8 episodes, in which the 8th episode never aired and can only be seen on the complete series dvd. We are still anticipating Season 5 of the original series till at last in 2012 an announcement of epic proportions for all CA fans, the official announcement of the release of Charlie's Angels Season 5 stand alone box set. Set for release on January 1, 2013!!! But will only be available thru MOD style, not at local retailers, no word yet on pricing but cover art is rumored to be that image in the CA Complete Series DVD Box Set.  Hope I made your day!

Here's the proof!:  Charlie's Angels - Individual Set is Scheduled for 'The Complete 5th Season' DVDs!

It won't be sold in stores, though, as it's coming out from Sony's MOD program

This past July we let you know that The Complete Series set being released that fall would NOT be the only way to get the final season of the show: we told you how Sony had plans to release Charlie's Angels - The Complete 5th Season ""later on."" Today the studio has formally announced that this item will be available on January 1st, New Years Day! However, it will NOT be in stores: Sony is putting it out via their manufacturing on demand (MOD) program, meaning you'll be able to acquire it online through places like Amazon's CreateSpace, and WBshop's Warner Archives. Box art isn't available yet (though we presume it will be the same one as seen inside The Complete Series package), nor do we have priciing yet. Stay tuned, though.

5426012,2,B00AIA884W,"Initial review This DVD set gets 2 stars purely for the content only. They lose two stars because of the particular DVD-R media and recording method used. Amazon, who manufactures this item on demand is misleading its customers. Right in the editorial review section it says ""This product is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drive "" This quote actually comes from the original Sony manufactured discs.  In fact the ONLY device type this media works in are PC based DVD+/-R/W drives. These disc do not work properly in any of my 3 stand alone DVD players Let us talk about why - These are recorded on DVD-R media. DVD-R and DVD+R media have only 30% of the reflectivity of a commercially manufactured DVD. The cheap laser pick-ups in mass manufactured DVD playback machines are too weak to read these discs properly. In the case of these particular discs menu navigation does not work. Why do they work in a PC drive of the type I described - simple - The DVD recorder drives in most PC-s and in the laptop I am typing this on - are meant to write to and work with DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R and DVD-RW as well as DVD-RAM media. The laser pick-ups have to be stronger and more sensitive.  !Note make sure you use a DVD recorder drive meant to work with the DVD- (""DVD minus"") family of media. Computer drives generally work with all of them. Standalone DVD recorders generally work with one or the other.",1424822400,3,1486,4.520446096654275

I was thrilled to find this available as it completes the set and looks great on my DVD shelves alongside seasons 1-4.
The only complaint is that Sony seem to have scrimped on the packaging, just 4 discs in one case, would have liked to have seen an episode booklet or information on the DVD sleeve as with other seasons.
Fortunately I have the Charlie's angels casebook by Jack Condon and David Hofstede to find my way round, and I told my partner about the one episode I always remembered and wanted to see again, that being Chorus Line Angels and the wonderful musical number; Pals, Buddies and Friends with Jaclyn once again displaying her dance skills.

5426079,3,B00AIA884W,"Charlie's Angels will always remain a show that redefined the TV landscape. It proved the women could do the same jobs as men, without the aid of a male companion. Charlie's Angels had a cast change nearly every season, excluding season three. Here, in Season Five, it happens yet again. Shelley Hack, who had replaced Kate Jackson in season four, is gone, and is replaced with model-turned-actress Tanya Roberts, a dashing redhead with ocean blue eyes. Having only heard about how bad this season was, I desperately awaited its DVD release back in January 2013. I have watched all 16 episodes of Season Five and here is what I have gathered:

1) Season Four Was Better. As much as Kate Jackson was missed and Shelley Hack's presence as Tiffany Welles was majorly hated, season four definitely had better stories, more like those from season one and two. Guest appearances by original cast member Farrah Fawcett are always pleasant to see, and the three from season four are the arguably the better ones. Season Five seems to repeat a lot of what Charlie's Angels had done in the past. ABC should have gotten some new writers to keep the show fresh, especially since they were instant on another cast change in 1980. It is easy to tell the writers were drained of ideas, they had absolutely nothing left to write for these girls, not even the rookie.
2) Tanya Roberts Is Better Than Shelley Hack. Season four was when critical reviews for Charlie's Angels really hit the rocks, with the majority complaining that Shelley Hack could not act. I agree, but Shelley was included in the better stories. To simplify my assumption, Season Five has an okay opener, introducing Tanya Roberts as Julie Rogers, the modeling school graduate who has had problems with the police. She is given a job at the Townsend Agency while she works to get her detective license. The first several episodes of Season Five place the Angels in Hawaii, which is merely an excuse to get the girls in bikinis, leaving little, almost no, room for plot development.
3) Season Five Is Unfocused. Season Five, to me, seems to be off balance. The writers through more and more attention to the ""look"" of the girls and not to their stories. Nothing of great importance happens throughout the season, and Julia, in particular, is never given a true chance to shine.
4) It Was Time For It To End. Having seen the fifth year of Charlie's Angels, it is fare for me to say, the show needed to end. I don't think anything could have saved it. New writers should have brought in season four to help introduce Shelley Hack, and then there would have been no need for another cast change. Again, it is noticeable that the series seems ""dull"". Even though some episodes are ""fresh"" ideas, the spark is gone. No amount of wardrobe changes or karate chops could saved the show from taking a nosedive in popularity.

Season Five of Charlie's Angels is not a waste, but definitely not the best season of the series. Seasons one is the best, followed by season two and four, then season three, and season five in last place. If you don't like Season Five, order it just to complete your collection. Overall, this season does deserve a chance, give it try.",1394841600,,3204,4.679078014184397
5426080,4,B00AIA884W,It's not the best season the Angels had but it has it's moments. Better story lines would have made the season better.they could have bought back guest Angels and it would have been better.,1390176000,,189,4.588235294117647

5426083,5,B00AIA884W,"Tanya Roberts gave the show a breath of fresh air in the show's last and strike fraught season.  Her character, Julie Rogers evokes memories of another crime fighting redhead April Dancer, the lead character of THE GIRL FROM U.N.C.L.E.(Stefanie Powers who portrayed April was by now in her Jennifer Hart Prime).  Julie Rogers had drop dead looks and I consider her the mod angel and seeing her dressed as a go-go dancer in the episode HULA ANGELS was a pleasure.  It was sad that the actors strike threw a monkey wrench into the season and shorten the season to 17 episodes.  Tanya Roberts had done all she could to keep the show going with her seductive looks and street smart portrayal of that smashing angel in the final season but like fellow cult siren Yvonne Craig (Batgirl from Batman) before her, it was too little too late as Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd decided to move on to bigger and better things.  Aside from Julie Rogers, the very last episode LET OUR ANGEL LIVE saw Kelly Garrett in the ICU as the doctors try to save her life; that episode was as dramatic as the latter part of THE JUDGMENT which was the final episode of classic series THE FUGITIVE.

5426084,3,B00AIA884W,"This is last season.  Series went through lots of changes beginning with Cheryl Ladd, who was a perfect replacement for the void left by Farrah.  By 4th season, it was bad writing, trying to show as much T&A as possible.  Not same after Kate Jackson left the series.  Put on the shoulders of two great actresses Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd.  Other replacement angel's never fit in - besides being pretty or having no problem wearing next to nothing and going braless.",1386460800,,468,4.658536585365853

For a major company to put out a major release of the final season of a ""pressed"" show on cheap burned media is rediculous.  +R's are more stable anyway.  (Sony invented the +R and -R was toshiba's thing).
  They should offer a proper pressed dvd for free to anyone who has the burned crap.

5426108,4,B00AIA884W,"In the wake of a sudden viewership drop in Season Four, actress Shelley Hack was fired from Charlie's Angels in February 1980. To keep the series afloat, producers began a new Angel hunt that summer. Reportedly over 2,000 candidates auditioned, but supermodel Tanya Roberts was choosen as Hack's replacement.

Roberts debuts in the Season Five two-part debut episode, ""Angel in Hiding,"" as Julie Rogers, a ex-beauty queen, modeling school graduate, and a previous ex-convict. Julie comes to the interest of Townsend & Associates after Tiffany Welles returns to Boston. Kelly and Kris use Julie as a go-between in the season opener case. At the end of the second part of ""Angel in Hiding,"" Julie is approved for a detective license and enters the trio.

In Julie, writers and producers try to give us a new kind of Angel. Unlike the previous Angels, Julie is rough around the edges, did not attend a police academy, and has had trouble with the law. She shows that she uses her fists more than her hand-gun, but that she can use her good looks to her advantage. Writers try to cash-in on Tanya Roberts' alluring looks, by showing the Angels go to Hawaii in several episodes towards the beginning of the season. In these episodes, it is the only time all three Angels are seen in bikinis.

Season Five has some interesting episodes: ""Angels of the Deep,"" ""Moonshinin' Angels,"" ""Taxi Angels,"" ""Chorus Line Angels,"" and ""Attack Angels"" among others. The series finale, ""Let Our Angel Live,"" is a semi-remake of an earlier season episode, and lives the show on a mixed note. I just wished Farrah, Kate, and Shelley would've came back for one last crime fighting show down.

Julie is given a slightly better treatment than Tiffany was given a year earlier by the writers. Many episodes showcase her in skimpy clothes, nothing like the others Angels have every wore. In some ways it seems as if they wanted to make her the ""new Farrah"" or something. Still, the original charm and chemistry isn't here.

The show might have been saved, though, if ABC didn't move it to three different timeslots throughout the season. The audience just didn't care to search for it on their TVs anymore, and that's why the series finished the 1980-81 season in 59th place out of just 65 shows.

After a three-year wait, it is good to see Season Five on DVD in a way to complete our Charlie's Angels collection. No, this is not the show's best year, but it does show us that the series could've lasted just a little while longer had the show been treated with greater appreciation.

Cheers, to a great show that is finally on DVD.",1374537600,5,2604,4.722466960352423

True there are some episodes that are either weak of imitations the producers have done in the past, but the quality is very good. My only thing with this package is that it is truly a rush job in the packaging itself. For starters there is no list of episodes to look for without putting the DVD in the player, the folks of Sony really could have done a better job in the areas of inner package design speaking as a graphic designer and even on the disc art. Still photos could have been carried out in the inner sleeve as they have done so in their previous releases of  CA, extras should have been placed on this set such as the deleted scenes from the two parter episodes that were originally aired as two hour jobs, outtakes and bloopers, and even some vintage commercials from the show itself. It is true that season five was not a very strong suit, however it could have faired well with some tidy marketing to make it really sell well.

I now own both but may decide to someday sell my series set (although I love the outer packaging, it's the inside that sucks). I am putting my pressed discs from the Complete Series in the Season 5 snapcase for easier access. The DVD-R discs that came in my S5 set all play fine in my PC and the menus and video quality are EXACTLY the same as the pressed discs, except the face of the discs are plain white with black lettering, not illustrated like the discs that were in the Complete Series set.

Hopefully this information will help those who are still undecided. Basically, if you already own Seasons 1-4 and do NOT want to double-dip on those by buying the cheaper, but poorly packaged Complete Series; you are paying a little more for DVD-Rs but in better packaging that will display nicely next to your Seasons 1-4 sets.

That being said, it's clear from watching these episodes that ""Charlie's Angels"" was dying a painful death in 1980-81 and there are only a few episodes here that qualify as good--not great. Tanya Roberts' debut in ""Angel in Hiding"" is the best thing about an otherwise standard caper set in the by-now-overused backdrop of modelling covers; ""Angel on the Line"" is a nice change-of-pace that has Kelly being stalked via telephone by a deranged psycho (Kudos to the director for allowing Jaclyn to do her own screaming during the final confrontation instead of the famous canned female shriek soundbyte that was used for every damsel in distress on the show--from college coeds to sexagenarian robbery victims); Joanna Cassidy makes a memorable villainess in the otherwise routine ""Hula Angels"".

Amazon is the ONLY place to purchase season 5.
Amazon ( I believe, don't know for certain) has set up several manufacturing agreements to offer lesser known and/or wanted movies (I think this is the first full TV series to be offered this way) that do have a market desire.
As it's been pointed out in other 'reviews' you can get the entire series for just a few dollars than just season 5.
So if you're a new fan of the original (and still the best version of) Charlie's Angels (or only have purchased one of the other seasons) then get the complete series; it's a great price for a great show.

I loved this show growing up but unlike most fans I never cared for Kate Jackson. She always looked so draped and now of course for all the behind-the-scene crap we know it was intentional on her part which only makes me like her even less.
My only complaint about this season was the loss of Shelley Hack.

5426234,3,B00AIA884W,"Charlie's Angels Season 4 saw the beautiful and stylish Shelley Hack replace fan favorite Kate Jackson. The ratings for the series already began to steadily drop during season 3 and Shelley's addition did not stop the inevitable so she too was replaced for season 5. Enter ravishing redhead Tanya Roberts. At that point in her career Tanya did not have a lot of experience but she was one hot tamale. Her named was briefly bantered about when the producers were looking to replace Kate Jackson. And while she was never a ""good"" actress at the time- her beauty sealed the deal and fans were introduced to the first non-police academy graduate in Ms. Julie Rogers. Julie is a stuggling model who aids her probation officer in tracking down the killer of her roommate and stumbles upon deep lines to drugs within the modeling agency that employed both young ladies. The Townsend Agency learns that Tiffany (Shelley Hack) has decided to stay back east (Boston) with her family and will not be staying on as an angel. Kelly, Kris & Boz also learn of the death of Julie's roommate and both Kelly & Kris sign up to be models with Julie's employer. The 2 part series opener is a mostly great episode. The only sad part was the casting of a clearly elderly man as the killer and Julie's roommate was a very healthy 20-something and could have easily fought him off with a hanky.

Impressed with Julie's investigative skills Charlie's earns her a temporary detective license and we are off!! The next handful of episodes take place in Hawaii as the agency opens an office there. While not perfect episodes the series still has some steam. That steam is completely gone once they return stateside and are hired to stop 2 feuding families in the backwoods of Iowa (I'm from Iowa and this episode is not only ridiculous but offensive) who are fighting over moonshine. Yep- MOONSHINE. An obvious ripoff of the far more popular Dukes of Hazzard series. The angels never quite get back on their feet after that. Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd were admittedly tired, too long in the tooth to play cheesecake convincingly and were ready to move on. Tanya was having a ball with her first taste of fame and fortune. The writing for season 5 is without a doubt the worst of the entire series run, the acting is also the worst but dang it if there isn't still something facinating about this series regarding 3 beautiful detectives, their overseeer Bosley and the employer the ladies never see (Charlie). I liked the addition of Tanya Roberts. Acting, schmacting. She's beautiful and truly not that awful as an actress. She'll never be in league with Meryl Streep or Jessica Lange but none of the other angels will be either. Finally the long sought after blonde, brunette and redhead combo was found. This is also the ONLY season to see all 3 angels in bikinis in the same episode. It was sad to see this once cultural phenomena end but fans had tuned out and tuned their TV's to ""Different Strokes"".

Farrah Fawcett (76-77), Shelley Hack (79-80) & Tanya Roberts (80-81) lasted just one season each, Kate Jackson lasted 3 (76-79), Cheryl Ladd enjoyed 4 seasons(77-81) and Jaclyn Smith (76-81) was the only angels to stay all 5 seasons. The debate over who is/was the best angel will rage on forever. My favorites are Tiffany Welles (Shelley), Julie Rogers (Tanya), Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn), Kris Munroe (Cheryl), Sabrina Duncan(Kate) and lastly Jill Munroe(Farrah). Also for me season 1 is my least favorite. For the majority of fans season 5 is the least favorite and I understand why but in the end- if you own seasons 1 - 4, how could you not purchase season 5? The series is simply not complete without all 5 seasons. Even more disappointing than the actual final season is Sony's glaring failure to include any extras with season 5's DVD release. Could they not have contacted Tanya for commentary? Gathered all of the remaining angels (Farrah sadly passed on a few years ago. As did David Doyle (Bosley) and John Forsythe (voice of Charlie)) for a grand rememberance? Fans were ripped off by Sony big time. I will gladly purchase season 5 of Charlie's Angels. 1.) I am a fan of it and 2.) The series is simply not complete without it.",1354406400,,4216,4.695945945945946

5426236,3,B00AIA884W,What I think Sony should do once they muster up the courage (ha!) to release S5 is include a disc with the now defunct Charlie's Angels 2011 series which only has 8 episodes as a bonus for having us diehard fans wait so long... who's with me?!? ;-),1349568000,,248,4.1875

Please tell me season 5 will be released individually like the rest. It would be silly for us to buy the first 4 seasons again just to get the 5th one. This was one of my favorite shows as a kid. And I still enjoy watching them today. I'll be keeping my out waiting.

Thanks.

5426249,5,B00AIA884W,"I can't believe that Charlie's Angels Season 5 is going to be in a boxed DVD instead of a separate DVD for all the fans who have already purchased the first 4 seasons.  The best revenge is DO NOT buy the boxed DVD.  Hopefully, that will speak to the distributors.",1347148800,2,263,4.24
5426250,2,B00AIA884W,"Seems like the DVD makers are going to screw us over as now they are releasing the complete series as a boxed set on September 25th!  So it looks like everyone with Seasons 1-4 already purchased will have to shell out $46.19 (amazon's price) to purchase all 5 seasons as a boxed set.  Similar to Barney Miller DVD releases when Season 1-3 were released individually and then came the complete series as a boxed set!  Oh well, I guess I'll wait until the price goes down as Tanya Roberts was definitely not my favorite angel and season 5 was not the best anyway.",1343174400,7,561,4.427184466019417
5426251,4,B00AIA884W,"Attention Sony Pictures: If you won't give us Season 5 as a retail release, at least do what you did with the 2011 remake series that bombed--make it available as a MOD-DVD here on Amazon for those of us who want it. The episodes have already been remastered; it's not hard to burn copies for fans and create some decent artwork--heck I will design the cover art myself if you want! Just please hurry and get this out.

Best episodes: Kelly facing off with a psychotic trannie in ""Angel on the Line"" and Julie held hostage by villainess Joanna Cassidy in ""Hula Angels"" as well as the star-studded ""Island Angels"" with Carol Lynley, Lyle Waggoner, Randy Mantooth, Barbi Benton and more!

The show had its share of stinkers this season such as ""Mr. Galaxy"", ""Moonshinin' Angels"" and ""Chorus Line Angels"" but a series with such a high pop-culture profile deserves to be completed on DVD.",1341964800,2,884,4.696774193548387

5426253,5,B00AIA884W,"It's been 3 years since season 4 was released and Sony is taking their sweet time giving us season 5. I know for a fact that seasons are generally released depending on sales of the previous season. However, by this time the show had fallen out of the top 20 in the ratings. I'm sure alot of this had to do with the change of characters. I liked Shelley Hack, but Tanya Roberts' street smart attitude was a nice edition to the show. This is  one of my favorite seasons with episodes such as 'Angel on a Roll', 'Taxi Angels', 'Angel on the Line', 'Angels in Hiding', and the Hawaii episodes. The cast was given notice that the show was being cancelled while filming 'Angel on a Roll'. Jacklyn Smith was intending to leave after this season, so the show probably would have been cancelled anyways. I don't think the show could have handled anymore cast changes. Bring on season 5, SONY.",1330819200,3,884,4.45679012345679
5426254,5,B00AIA884W,"Like the other reviewers I too am an avid fan of the original Charlie's Angels and will surely buy the season 5 dvd. I have several copies of seasons 1 to 4, only one copy of each season was opened so that I can watch it whenever I feel like it.  I guess I am just a collector at heart.  Season 5 is notable because not only was it the last season, it was their ""sexiest "" season, with all 3 angels wearing bikinis or bathing suits unlike the previous seasons where one angel is always the ""conservative"" type, wink, wink, i.e. calling Sabrina and Tiffany. Although Tiffany did wear a bathing suit and shorts , she was not as sexy as Jill, Kelly, Kris and Julie.
So Sony please release the season 5 dvd. I remember last year in November, Walmart started selling seasons of Charlie's Angels dvd along with Soap, Mash , etc.  When I saw the display stand with huge photos of the angels I excitedly sprinted to it thinking that season 5 would be included but alas, it was not. But I still bought copies of season 1 to 4. There will never be an incarnation of Charlie's Angels as great as the original, not the 2 spoofy movies nor the cancelled TV reboot.  So paging the powers that be, please release the dvd so that the thousands of fans can complete their collection already!!!",1329523200,4,1276,4.326359832635983

This last season was on it's way out the door but it also had a few good episodes along with some episodes which were like repeats of earlier episodes, ie let our angel live was similar to when Kelly was shot in the head by the little boy in season 1.
