8387095,3,B0031O7YHY,"""Son of Zorro"" is a 13-chapter Republic serial released in 1947, directed by Spencer Bennet and Fred C. Brannon, with screenplay by Franklin Adreon, Basil Dickey, Jesse Duffey and Sol Shor.

Jeff Stewart (George Turner), returning from the Civil War, finds Box County, Texas overrun with crooked politicians, taking over ranches after assessing taxes that can't possibly be paid, and placing a heavy toll on the only road through the county.  The culprits include Sheriff Moody (Edward Cassidy) and Judge Hyde (Ernie Adams), aided by outlaw Boyd (Roy Barcroft) and his gang, but they are taking orders from a ""big boss"" whose identity is kept secret.  Jeff is a descendent of Zorro, and while he prefers using legal means, he soon finds that being a vigilante is the only way to deal with the crooks running the county.

This is hardly of the quality of ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" and George Turner is one of several serial movie actors who looked good, but were rather one-dimensional; it's just as well he didn't try using a ""Don Diego"" identity.  And while it makes the costume change easier, this ""Zorro"" lacks not only a whip, but also sword and cape.  Peggy Stewart is fine as the Postmistress, Kate Wells, more-involved in the plot than most serial-movie heroines, though she gets knocked unconscious or tied up at least every other chapter.  If the plot is somewhat tired, Ernie Adams, Edward Cassidy and Roy Barcroft are good at their bad-guy roles, and there's plenty of action, with well-choreographed fist fights and first-rate stunt work.  In smaller roles are many familiar actors from ""B"" westerns and serials, including Charles King, Al Ferguson, Tom London, Edmund Cobb, George Chesebro and, an entertaining piece of casting, Stanley Price as Jeff's ranch foreman and Zorro-assistant, Pancho.

The edition from Smarty Pants Entertainment, sold through Bill Black's AC Comics is on two DVD-R discs, single layer, which should not cause problems on most players.  It comes with both discs in a paper envelope, inside the two-disc case, which should avoid the problem of damage due to the discs becoming loose in shipment.  The video was ""mastered"" from Republic's Laserdisc edition, and while I am not thrilled with this practice, other vendors have done the same, and for this serial no ""honest"" editions have been marketed for many years.  There's a genuine Laserdisc mistracking glitch two minutes into Chapter Seven, where the picture ""rolls"" briefly, but otherwise the transfer is reasonably good.  This was one of the few Republic serials that I did not collect on Laserdisc when it was issued, in part because the videotape release suggested the quality of source material did not justify the expense, and the technical faults in the DVD are the same ones seen in Republic's videotape.  The image has good gray scale, and is fairly sharp, but the small lettering in the opening credits is not easy to read.  There is film deterioration, maybe from residual processing chemicals that causes a ring of speckles in the opening credits of several of the later chapters.  The sound is a worse issue, badly distorted in chapters Eight, Ten and Thirteen, and high frequencies are not plentiful in the last half of the serial, though the dialogue isn't too hard to understand.  Both picture and sound are cleaner in the trailer, included as an ""extra"" along with 30-some still pictures from Zorro and Zorro-like serials, plus trailers for ""Don Daredevil Rides Again,"" ""Man with the Steel Whip"" and ""Zorro Rides Again,"" this last one having a blanked out area in the lower-left corner for the first few seconds, as if a logo was hidden.  The first chapter of ""Zorro's Black Whip"" is also included, apparently from Republic's Laserdisc.

While less inspired than the great Republic serials of a few years earlier, ""Son of Zorro"" displays the studio's expertise in ""B"" westerns, and watched with a day or so between the 13-minute chapters the plot seems to move along fairly well.  For those with the VHS tape and working players there isn't a lot of advantage to this DVD-R release other than playback convenience, though the DVD has less video noise and would probably look better on a large display.  I would prefer an ""official"" DVD release, but until that happens this one from AC Comics is quite adequate.",1376092800,,4321,4.965325936199722
