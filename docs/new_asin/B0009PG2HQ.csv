I just loved the idea of the game being on a college campus and everyone having dosier's on each other. Fun until ....you have someone going ape because they lost!!!  Love the idea of a love interest happening, especially when your tracking your next person. Very distracting!!!! Would love to own this movie but not at the price that is offered.",1512345600,,444,4.55

I received an almost immediate email response saying that it was sent out a long time ago; long enough to have arrived by then, and that they would look into the situation. I replied to the emaiil the next Monday, and have yet to receive any further correspondence.

I saw this film years ago, when it first came out, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I wanted to keep it in a small collection I have started and thought that it would have been a good Christmas present for myself.

To review the product, I can't say, but so far, I have been totally dissatisfied with the supplier.",1230336000,2,724,4.519083969465649
8064712,2,B0009PG2HQ,"TAG: The Assassination Game (Nick Castle, 1982)

Nick Castle's first big-screen project was quite the indicator of things to come. TAG, underground cult success that it was, propelled Castle into the big time, directing such deathless fare as... erm, well, Tap. And Major Payne. (And those were the good movies.) But TAG was a staple of my formative years, and I hadn't seen it in about two decades, though I still had that ""ah... she's a PSYCHOLOGY major!"" line get stuck in my head now and again. So I decided I'd give it a whirl and see if it held up to the nostalgia in my head.

Simply put, the answer is no, and it's ""no"" with extreme prejudice. To be blunt, this is an awful, awful movie. Unlike such other eighties cult favorites as Night of the Creeps, TAG has aged as badly as Joan Rivers without plastic surgery.

The plot, for those of you, perhaps, too young to remember the game: The Assassination Game was played with some sort of nonlethal projectile weapon (in the film, it's suction-cup guns; we used water pistols at my school) where a number of people are out to eliminate certain other players based on mysterious missives sent before the game begins by the coordinator. When you eliminate your target, you take over his assignment, and so on and so on, until the final two are pitted against one another. (At our school, by some wonderful coincidence, the final two ended up facing each other on prom night-- and they went together. You can imagine the outcome.) In the film, Loren Gersh (Re-Animator's Bruce Abbott, in his first film role) is the undefeated five-time champion at his university, a social outcast who really has nothing to do but play the game. When Gersh is eliminated accidentally while trying to eliminate another player, his fragile mind snaps, and he decides to continue on playing-- except using a real pistol. Meanwhile, an intrepid school reporter, Alex Marsh (Robert Carradine, yes, of those Carradines), has been drawn into the game when an attractive young player, Susan Swayse (The Terminator's Linda Hamilton in her second big-screen sppearance), ducks into his room one night to avoid the player trying to eliminate her. Marsh, an unsuccessful ladies' man if ever there was one, conceives of the idea to do an expose on the game as a way to get close to Susan. Given all that, I'm sure you can figure out the remaining seventy-five minutes of this film, because if there is a way for the plot, the setting, and the characters to be predictable, they rise to the occasion.

As a nostalgia kick, it might be worth a rental if you can find a dusty copy in your video store's archives. If you haven't seen it before, however, there are thousands of better films out there waiting for you, why try this one? * ",1143072000,4,2758,4.666666666666667

Jaded viewers imposing current film standards and expectations may want to look elsewhere, but if one has an appreciation for 80's movies and other movies of this type and pace, then it's clear that Tag has aged well for what it is. Tag is a dark comedy-thriller that takes place on a college campus during the 1980's. Think of something along the lines of Terror Train (1980 with Jamie Lee Curtis), except with comedy and a tongue in cheek quality to it, at least in the films first half. TAG, The Assassination Game (1982) is a great little film that has gained a strong, though seemingly small fan following over the years. I've watched it many times since I discovered it in the early 80's (after which I got a few people together in my high school so we could hunt each other down with rubber band guns -not recommended). A lot of people simply don't appear to know much about this dark comedy/thriller. Most people who've seen this film give it decent reviews, but the reviews themselves are few and far between. So, here is a little more information about this great flick.

The plot is simple. At a college campus the latest pastime is a game called TAG. TAG players are given lists of targets (consisting of other players in the TAG group) that they chase after all over the large college campus with fake plastic suction tipped dart guns. The last man or woman who hasn't been hunted down and successfully tagged in the end, wins. There are a few rules to this campus game (game play stops at 12:00 midnight, etc.), but that's about it. It's all a fun pastime with a chance to meet new people. That is, until things go wrong. The reigning champion (played wonderfully by Bruce Abbott in his first film role) gets so upset over getting tagged and losing that he decides to use real bullets instead and continue on with the game. The movie is a decent paced 80's film with a noir like tongue in cheek quality to it that develops into the dark and serious, contains a fair amount of suspense, and pulls it all off with nice style for a little film. Its ending is serious, but with a wink, and an homage to those noir films of yesteryear. It also shows that gore, tons of violence, etc., is not necessary to make a good thriller.

Though I've never seen anything else really like TAG, there are a few other movies that one might like if they like it, such as Silver Streak (1976), and Foul Play (1978). I hope some day TAG gets remastered to DVD. Till then, I guess its out of print VHS tapes. TAG, was written and Directed by Nick Castle. Castle was involved in helping his friend, Director John Carpenter write Escape From New York, and TAG was Castle's first Directing project. Castle would later go on to direct more commercially honed films (for that time period) such as The Last Starfighter, The Boy Who Could Fly, and others. He's still working today. He was also the original man behind the mask in Halloween. Having already been in a number of films before TAG, (most notable to me is The Big Red One as a cigar smoking writer named Pvt. Zab), Robert Carradine appears in Tag as a dashing cigar smoking journalist who falls in love with the movies heroine. After TAG, Carradine went on to do Revenge of the Nerds in 1984 as Lewis Skolnick. He's still active in his long career. Aside from a couple of TV roles and minor work, TAG is Linda Hamilton's first real film. Her role as Sarah Connor in Terminator (1984) was still two years away. One can tell from watching her in TAG that she already had a good grip on her craft. She's beautiful here, and thankfully we would see a lot more of her skill and beauty in the years to come, and still do. (Incidentally, Bruce Abbott apparently did ""get"" Linda Hamilton in the end after all, in reality that is. They were married from December 19, 1982 till they were divorced in 1989. They had one son together Born October 4, 1989, Dalton Abbott.)",1136592000,5,3989,4.476648351648351
