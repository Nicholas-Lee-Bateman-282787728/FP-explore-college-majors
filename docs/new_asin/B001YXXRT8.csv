When the Scorps are talking in english there is some DOUCHE bag translating everything into German so you can't here anything they say. Why do they say english format when all I here is german translaters. And no I checked you can not turn that off. Unless you understand German this is a waste of money and time. The fact that this is unauthorized should had tipped me off that it was an inferior product. The Scorpions would had never let something so awful be released with there name on it.",1262304000,2,648,4.453781512605042
