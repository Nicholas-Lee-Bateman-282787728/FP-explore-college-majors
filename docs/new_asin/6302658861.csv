493858,4,6302658861,"""Paul and Michelle"",the sequel to ""Friends"" is set 3 years after the lovers last saw each other. Paul goes to find Michelle against the wishes of his Father. Of course they meet again and have a joyful reunion. But things do not go quite as well as planned... There is no happy ever after here, more a shade of reality which many will identify with. Watching this can be a little disappointing, after all to fans of the first film we all have an idea of how this follow up might have been. Well worth catching if you wonder what happened after ""Friends"". Still waiting for that third and final sequel!",1085961600,14,601,4.423423423423423

7829151,1,6302658861,"The sequel to the movie "" Friends "" is awful.  Dark, miserable, and mean. Am very disappointed it was directed by the same person. Total cop out. "" Friends "" was an excellent film. My only mistake was ever watching the sequel.",1411689600,,226,4.380952380952381
7829152,5,6302658861,I want to buy the VHS of Paul and Michelle for another reason... There can be no sequel to this second part because reality is sometime more sad than the movie. Anicee Alvina passed away from lung cancer in 2006. She was 53. I feel that the best way to honor her is to enjoy her best work as an actress. She was also a very fine singer.,1393372800,,336,3.9558823529411766

7829154,5,6302658861,"This is yet to be sold on DVD.  It is a real shame.  It is a good movie.  I wish they would put more movies and shows on DVD like this instead of some of the crap they do put out.  I saw this when I was a teen.  Back then everything was on VHS and my mom had seen it when she was a teen so she wanted to share this and the other one, (There are two total, the other called Friends) and I enjoyed them a lot.  I just wish you could get this on DVD.",1371600000,3,447,3.4646464646464645

7829156,1,6302658861,"The original, Friends"" was magical back when we were young. This sequel, however, isn't what Id hoped for, sad.
I guess the old adage is true,  ""You can never go home.""",1355011200,2,168,4.419354838709677
7829157,5,6302658861,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, I remember being disappointed when I saw how it ended when I was much younger, now I wasn't disappointed and understood and appreciated it much better.  If you loved Friends and Elton John Music in Friends, there wasn't his music this time in the sequel, but it is a very good movie for it's time!",1296345600,4,332,4.354838709677419
7829158,5,6302658861,"Back in 1975, when I was at the Air Force Academy -Venezuela, we used to watch a movie every friday night.  The night I saw Friends, with Paul & Michelle, changed the way of seeing life for me then, because being only 16 1/2 years old, I had to be inside those four walls.  However, my mind was set up free and had virtually no boundaries.

Years past by and I was not able to watch theat wonderful movie ever, and the song was not heard much either anywhere.  Now, this classic movies from the 70's brings back so many nice memories of that young couple that revived the way life should be.  Of course, Mr. Elton John's song gave that final ""touche"".  Thanks to Mr Gilbert too, was terrific.

PLAY IT AGAIN IN THEATERS, CABLE, TV, INTERNET, EVERYWHERE so people can enjoy it as much as I did.  My wife Yanet and myself are very grateful and we will watch it again soon. The song, well what can I say, it is one of our very own personal symbols. lh",1148256000,14,948,4.198895027624309
