6262580,4,B00IF8Q8XC,Mr. Jones is unexpected in a sea of found-footage horror that is a cut above the rest because of it's innovative uses of the camera. The use of simple technique to achieve some terrifying scenes is utilized wonderfully here. The acting is on-par which one usually does not expect especially considering this never even made it to theaters. There are twists and turns that you won't see coming and even a role change from the viewers perspective that has definitely never ever been done before! This film deserves a shot with interesting new mythology and some very intense scares!,1399420800,3,580,4.8686868686868685

6262587,3,B00IF8Q8XC,"MR. JONES is not the kind of movie I usually watch.  I really outgrew horror films of this ilk many decades ago.  However, since the DVD was sent to me for review, I read a couple of articles about the picture that indicated it was well above the norm, so I decided to invest 90 minutes of my life into viewing it.

The basic plot is a familiar one.  A young couple, Scott  (Jon Foster) and Penny (Sarah Jones), move to a remote cabin in the woods to escape urban life and make a nature documentary.  After awhile, they discover that they have a mysterious neighbor, Mr. Jones, who creates strange, creepy sculptures in the woods.  In fact, Penny immediately recognizes Jones work.  He is a world famous artist, who nobody has ever met, and whose creations sell for seven figures.  Immediately, the couple decides to abandon their nature documentary and, instead make a film about Jones.

This turns out to be a big mistake, particularly when Scott and Penny sneak into the elusive Jones house and photograph his studio and creations.

The first half of this low budget effort, directed by Karl Mueller, works quite well.  The characters of Scott and Penny are well defined; the dialogue is good and the set-up with talking heads (e.g. Diane Neal, David Clennon, and others) discussing the known history of Mr. Jones is intriguing.  The scenes with Scott sneaking around the dark tunnels beneath Jones studio are also effective with their sudden, albeit expected,  shocks.

Unfortunately, the movie lost me in its final third when it tried to explain what the hell was going on.  I got the basic concept of who or what Mr. Jones was, but the explanation was so lengthy and convoluted that, by the end of the film, I was totally confused as to what had happened.  And, frankly, by that time, I didn't really care.

As I said in the first paragraph, this is not my kind of movie.

MR. JONES is available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

6262588,5,B00IF8Q8XC,"Before I sat down to watch MR. JONES, I purposely made sure not to research the film or even look it up on imdb.com.  Although other peoples opinions, especially those of esteemed critics, do not hold any sway in my personal assessment of films, I did this primarily because the plot was so intriguing that I wanted to be completely surprised.  And let me tell you, I was definitely impressed!  This treasure of a film from the Tribeca International Film Festival is an excellent horror flick, full of both originality and suspense.

In a genre full of overused ideas and tired concepts, I find it extremely refreshing when a film like this comes along.  The plot is not complex, but it is one of those you definitely have to focus on to stay up with the film.  And while the concept is simplistic in nature, the movie will take you in a wildly entertaining ride.

MR. JONES has some great cinematography, although the majority of it is shot from a first-person perspective (some is third-person, when one of the characters sets the camera down).  But this is not your run-of-the-mill found-footage video.  The shots in this film are carefully crafted, and give major credibility to the authenticity of the frights.  As a result, the camerawork is a big contributor to the chilling atmosphere of the film as a whole.

The acting is first rate, with Jon Foster and Sarah Jones heading up the small but talented cast.  I am particularly impressed with the way Jones conveys fear with her eyes; many actresses try to accomplish this but it usually comes across as forced.  Jones, to her credit, pulls this off with ease.  The result is a much more immersive (and therefore frightening) movie experience.

Theres not really any gore in MR. JONES, but the special effects are incredible nonetheless.  I am speaking in particular to the artwork that Mr. Jones creates.  These vivid yet simple pieces are powerful in their presence onscreen, and just looking at one by itself for a moment is enough to invoke chills.  I would love to own one of these props personally, as it would make a heck of a conversation piece!

MR. JONES is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The film is a unique, surrealistic nightmare that ends with a nice twist I didn't see coming.  In short, its a perfect horror flick.  Give this one a look in a couple of weeks when it hits theaters; or, if youd prefer to watch it at home, the DVD/Blu-ray version will be released shortly thereafter.  Regardless of where you watch it, make sure you're not alone",1398038400,24,2534,4.632286995515695
6262609,2,B00IF8Q8XC,"This movie had potential, but like so many others it had to slip into ""science fiction"" mode to find a way to end the movie.
It began as a pretty good thriller with the possibilities of reality horror, but lost it's way into a confusing and not believable mess.

Unfortunately not recommended.",1493078400,,293,4.634615384615385
6262610,5,B00IF8Q8XC,"I don't do plot summaries, because it spoils the film for many people, so if you are looking for that, read someone else's review.  Everyone else does it.

I'm surprised more people haven't noticed this hidden gem.

This movie kind of markets itself as a horror movie in the vein of Blair Witch Project.  This is a mistake however, but Blair Witch fans might still like it.  The film uses many of the same cinematic elements as Blair Witch: 1) The 'documentary' style where participants are creating the film, 2) suspense and 3) terrifying little 'revelations' that still leave unanswered questions that build to a crescendo.  The film isn't really a horror movie, however, though some might disagree, and I will accept the argument.

This movie is more in line with many of M. Night Shamalaya's ""horror"" films, which, in my opinion, aren't really horror films, exactly, but more metaphysical suspense movies.  The same is true here.  Perhaps a person might argue that 'metaphysical suspense' is a sub-category of horror, but that's where I think I would begrudgingly agree with you.  Otherwise, I think it's a great metaphysical suspense film.",1488931200,,1144,4.973684210526316

6262612,4,B00IF8Q8XC,I had no idea what this movie was before I watched it. I was a fan of the cover of the DVD and decided to watch the movie. This film was shot very well to me. The script wasn't any thing mind blowing and the plot didn't seem clear until the movie was damn near over.. but the entire mr. jones concept was a hit for me.

The art i do need to talk about, it is stunning, someone put a lot of work into this movie, and i appreciate that more than some hollywood blah blah, not that hollywood isn't talented, this just has a sweet, home made quality without falling into the blair witch trope.
It's been almost a year since i've watched it, but i still think fondly of it, and that doesn't happen often with the old concept of ""boy and girl in creepy forest, going out at night being creepy"" films.
Research it some more before handing over ten dollars, because i'm not sure it's worth that on the off chance you don't like it. I was lucky to catch it on netflix for free.",1448150400,,919,4.287356321839081

But about halfway through, this movie really kicks into gear and takes you into a nightmarish world where you don't know what is real, or where it's gonna take.you next.

6262617,1,B00IF8Q8XC,"Ever see a film so terrible you simply have to write your first review? Ta dah, you've just finished Mr Jones!
It is not the premise or story that is terrible. Rather, the first forty minutes were great at building tension and creepiness - tons of potential. But the technical flaws of directing are so numerous as the film progresses that I literally lost my temper. In an eighty-minute film, the last twenty minutes is, no joke, at least half composed of a sheer black screen: the entire scene goes dark, comes back for three seconds, goes black for three seconds, comes back for three seconds...cuts to flashes of static...dark for three seconds...am I adequately conveying how ridiculous this is? It does not increase terror or paranoia, it is pure lazy filmmaking that makes you want to scream in rage. What shots remain are all warped or through static, with distorted sound, meaning it is impossible to stay scared at all. It's like watching ten minutes of recovered footage from a wreck, as the power goes out every three seconds, stretched over 30 minutes, as the story wavers from terror to paranoia and the worn, insanely worn cliche, 'maybe it's all in the mind!' Absolutely infuriating, and completely destroyed what had the potential to be a very scary little film.",1438992000,,1279,4.818181818181818

6262633,2,B00IF8Q8XC,"Like too much 'indie' horror, Mr Jones starts with an interesting premise and then proceeds to take itself way too seriously, creating a piece of shoe-gaze ""art"" that you almost think you kind of see what they were aiming at, but ultimately likely only makes sense to the director.",1422921600,,281,4.755102040816326
6262634,3,B00IF8Q8XC,"A couple move out into a cabin in the wilderness as part of a year-long documentary the male half is making. They discover they may be neighbors to an elusive, mysterious figure known only as Mr. Jones, a man famous for sending strange scarecrows to people all over the world for an unknown purpose. This movie has potential to be a good found footage movie. A lot of things are done right, like the premise, the genuine creepiness of the Mr. Jones character, his house, and his scarecrows, but a lot are done wrong. I don't know what moron came up with the idea for a double-facing camera, so that you could film both the action and the person's face filming the action, but man, does this movie use that gimmick for all its worth. There's no reason for it 99% of the time, as this movie demonstrates. For example, want to see shots of a creepy, seemingly abandoned house, or see the person's face seeing those shots, in rapid, totally unnecessary cuts? Well, you get both. Hope you're happy, one person who asked for that. Using that gimmick, this movie seriously overdoes it on the reaction shots. The faces of the two characters get burned into your retinas, you see that many extreme close-ups of their faces. And you gotta love characters who don't question for a single second if it's wrong to trespass, go though someone's home, and even steal their stuff when they're not around. If the door's not locked you can do whatever you want, I guess. While the couple doesn't seem like your average horror movie morons at first, as the movie goes on it becomes more and more apparent that they're idiots with no common sense. The seemingly intelligent characters act stupid when it's necessary to get from one plot point to another. I blame weak writing for that.
There's so much atmosphere and creepiness in this movie. I want to like it. The set designs are awesome, I really dig the premise and story. But... The two things I mentioned above, the double-facing camera and the characters' lack of common sense, plus the way the found footage format is dropped for the final act, they draw so much from the movie for me. If you can see past such things, though, I'd recommend this movie.",1421625600,5,2190,4.589285714285714
6262635,3,B00IF8Q8XC,It was alright.  I expected it to be really spooky and scary but it was a little more confusing in some places - I wouldn't watch it again but I suppose it was okay once.,1419465600,,170,3.857142857142857
6262636,5,B00IF8Q8XC,This movie was actually a pleasant surprise. The one and only reason I bought this was because Pumpkinrot was the man behind the scarecrows and I'm guessing the overall feel of the movie sets. That being said the story was actually an enjoyable one to watch.,1417996800,,258,4.630434782608695
6262637,3,B00IF8Q8XC,"Original plot, good acting, and even some scares. I definitely would recommend this to any serious fan of the found footage, c-movie horror genre.",1416700800,,146,5.125
6262638,4,B00IF8Q8XC,"After reading through several of the other reviews for this movie I can't but feel most of the people who rated it poorly did so simply because they are burned out on the whole ""found footage"" approach rather than because they genuinely didn't like it. Yes, at this point it's probably very difficult to put on a new spin on the genre, but this movie still felt somewhat fresh compared to so many of the other low budget flicks out there now.

First, I thought the acting was decent and the two main leads were very likeable. The detailed sets ranged from gorgeous to eerie and there was a real sense of atmosphere about it all. Most impressive of all is the cinematography - I enjoyed simply just looking at the movie. What struck me as clever is that each camera shot seemed carefully choreographed and the viewer sees only what we are meant to see at the moment, as opposed to someone just randomly running around with a shaky camcorder. Plot-wise the last fifteen minutes or so did seem a little pretentious or convoluted and at moments bordered too much on ""weird for weird's sake"" for my taste but it does all wrap up nicely in the end and kept me interested overall. As long as you listen carefully to the dialogue and pay attention you should be fine.

So while not exactly a groundbreaking film, in a genre where these types of reality-based movies tend to blend together after a while I thought Mr. Jones really stood out as a cut above the rest and would definitely recommend giving it a whirl if you get the chance.",1415145600,4,1527,4.469534050179211

It totally dropped the ball trying to use the cheap camera tricks that is the ""found footage"" style, which they didn't need to do. They just needed to take the time to put a little more thought into the script, develop the story a little bit more, and then get a bigger budget so they could shoot an actual real film worthy of the story they were trying to tell. This storyline and premise had such promise, and the trailer preview was put together very well, but the film as a whole was very disappointing. The ""found footage"" style killed the film in my opinion. It was just a camera trick trying to camouflage the fact that they didn't have the budget or a fully developed script to deliver the ideas they had developed. Again, the ideas and the premise of the story had such potential and were intriguing, and could have made a hell of a good movie. They just failed to deliver.",1413849600,4,966,4.372222222222222

I took a chance buying it because I've been an avid follower of Pumpkinrot's blog for years. The movie overall was just inconsistent bordering on incoherent. It almost seemed as if there was no script at all. Just random, ad-libbed dialog, intermixed with typical movie cliches and two fairly unlikable lead characters whose actions make no sense through much of the movie. The found footage aspect made it all feel even more intolerable. I see where it was trying to go in the third act with the whole dream world aspect, but it was just a mess. I found myself hoping whatever force was at work in the film would just slaughter the two leads. I forced myself through watching it because I paid money for the Blu ray, but honestly two minutes into the opening of it I wanted desperately to turn it off and throw it away.",1413158400,4,989,4.43956043956044

Jon Foster and Sarah Jones portray a long-term couple:  he is a director of nature documentaries, and she is a photographer.  They leave their urban existence behind to live for a while in a cabin.  They soon realize a mysterious man is quietly living nearby.  The recluse has decorated the landscape with elaborate and imposing sculptures, and she recognizes him as one ""Mr. Jones,"" an anonymous artist notorious for sending macabre pieces to random people in the early 1970s.  He is a ghost-story curiosity among museum curators and art critics, none of whom know his identity.  The couple decide to investigate further and create a film focused on Jones, but they, of course, discover much more than they bargained more.  For the first hour, this 83-minute film is atmospheric and riveting, unfolding as a blend of The Blair Witch Project and Jeepers Creepers.  There are eerie shots in which the figure of Jones enters the frame behind the protagonists (unbeknownst to them), and the winding tunnels and expansive rooms beneath his cabin are a triumph of genre production design.  The ways in which the mythology of the enigmatic title charactera type of primitive-art Unabomberis established are neat, too.  Alas, the third act descends into dream-versus-reality abstraction, which is conveyed via extra-frenetic editing and disorienting photography.

This could have been a really good horror movie in more competent hands.  First, there's nothing terrifying in this movie. Except for how annoying the main characters are.  Second, the movie doesn't start until about 10 minutes into the movie. There's a bunch of nonsense in the beginning about the dissolution of the characters' relationship that does nothing to tell you what the central story is.  Assuming you can get through the first half of the movie, the second half dissolves into a hodge-podge of bad film cuts. And, by this time, you really don't care who Mr Jones is or if the main characters survive.  In fact, you kinda hope that they all just end up dead. The movie itself is a cross between Blair Witch, Nightmare on Elm St,  and Paranormal Activity.  That's not a good thing. So, this guy, Mr. Jones, copies the scarecrows from Blair Witch and posts them around his home, in the woods, and mails them to random people across the world. Why he sends them to random people is never really explained.  The couple discovers the home of Mr Jones and in typical yuppie privileged fashion, decide they can trespass, take pictures, and steal his stuff so they can make money. And here's where the really bad directing happens:  The movie splits into two parts.  The guy goes to interview people who received a scarecrow from Mr Jones.  The girl spies on Mr Jones for her own version of a documentary.  And gets caught by Mr Jones, who doesn't utter a word throughout.  When they get back together, strange things really begin happening.  Strange loud noises, things following them as they trespass into Mr Jones' home again, birds flying into the home.  Then the dream boyfriend chases the ""real"" boyfriend.  Is it a nightmare that can become reality?  I only wish Freddy Kruger had appeared to make the movie more interesting or make me care anymore.  The actors are not the problem.  It's the bad script, bad editing, and bad direction. And the constant streaming problems by Amazon don't help either.  Film schools need to go back to teaching what REAL horror is and how to tell a story properly.",1405209600,5,2230,4.698453608247423

A young couple wants to make a movie, so they rent a remote cabin.  They discover, through minor misanthropy, that their reclusive neighbor is Mr. Jones, an artist who makes ""Blair Witch Project"" type mobiles out of sticks and what looks like dried pets.  These are genuinely creepy, and, we're told, very collectible.  But, who is Mr. Jones?  And, how about the curse that comes with owning (or is it merely seeing) one of these dreadful sculptures?

6262675,5,B00IF8Q8XC,"First I watched this movie. Then I decided to watch it again right away. Then I decided to run through the last half hour or so taking quick notes in longhand, pausing to catch any fleeting but crucial detail that might try to elude mebecause those last thirty minutes, to me, are pay dirt. This movie is pay dirt. It's exactly the sort of beautiful, intellectually challenging, hugely rewarding undiscovered gem that reminds me why it is I watch so many lesser known horror films.

This movie is and is not like a David Lynch movie. It is like a David Lynch movie in that the more you heighten your attention to detail, double meanings and visual symbols, tiny facial tics and giveaways. But unlike a David Lynch movie, which quickly becomes like trying to solve a puzzle where none of the pieces want to fit together, you'll find that it really only takes a little bit of added vigilance before you start to get a satisfying tapestry, one so satisfying that I feel I have to be very careful revealing any detail of the plot, for fear of giving too much away.

It's also possible to enjoy this movie without thinking too much at all. It is an intelligent movie, but not one that wears its intelligence like a badge or tries to outsmart its viewer. There is suspense, there are frightening situations, there is beautiful cinematography. It is a beautiful movie that uses and plays with the conventions of the found footage genre, and that pushes the envelope of what defines found footage in some brilliant ways.

Found footage isn't for everyone. (It seems like I'm digressing here, but I'm actually notthere's a message to my madness). The found footage sub-genre of horror comes with a lot of baggage. The essential thing that defines ""found footage"" is that the camera exists within the world being portrayed. It can be held by a news reporter, a documentary maker, a film student, a reality show DP, the best friend of a horror movie director, an ordinary guy who's afraid his house is haunted. It poses challenges to writers, directors and actors, because a lot of these movies fall apart when you start asking questions like ""Why is this camera here?"" ""Why is this particular moment being filmed?"" Some films are so entertaining that lapses in credibility are easily forgiven. In other films, the viewer is caught wondering things like ""why on earth is this person filming a private conversation if the person's job is to film a documentary?"" or ""Why would you be filming in a life-threatening situation where you clearly would have a major survival advantage if you had both hands free?"" In the worst cases, these questions have no good answers. The very best found footage movies (which, in my mind, are Daylight, Apt 143 and this one) both raise these questions and then offer answers surprise you and add to the movie.

Again, you don't need to burden your mind with a bunch of questions going into this movie, but I would suggest just one thingperiodically, every five, ten, fifteen minutes or so, as yourself, ""Where is the camera?"" Just that question, nothing more. ""Where is the camera?"" Like a mantra. Keep asking it to yourself. ""Where's the camera?""",1402876800,5,3167,4.731884057971015

I thought it was cool and creative for a while, and admit every now and then, a good one comes by, (Paranormal Activity, V/H/S, Afflicted) But with the vast number of imitators, this subgenre has become gimicky, predictable, and redundant. What I really like about Mr. Jones is its originality. It creates its own urban legend and folklore of this ancient character. Once it hands the audience its mystery, it begins to unravel at a steady pace, never boring or disappointing. The story comes full-circle, which is somewhat of a relief. If you are a gorehound, you may be disappointed. The film is PG-13, which should be a good indicator for a very low body count.",1402876800,5,746,4.746153846153846

6262691,3,B00IF8Q8XC,"I first heard of ""Mr. Jones"" because of Pumpkinrot. If you don't know what Pumpkinrot is, he/she is a mysterious artist who specializes in Halloween decorations and ""stumpery.""

And those weird, unsettling sculptures of bone and wood are at the heart of ""Mr. Jones,"" a low-budget horror movie that starts off as a found footage movie, works through an eerie search for a mysterious artist... and becomes a weird hallucinatory cascade in the final act. Director Karl Mueller stumbles with the found-footage format, but the mysterious ending and creepy atmosphere work well.

Scott (Jon Foster) and Penny (Sarah Jones) are having some marital problems, so they rent a house out in the wilderness so Scott can film a documentary on... something. He hasn't decided what, so he just sort of rambles around looking at wildlife. But then a strange person in a hoodie snatches his backpack, and he stumbles across a strange sculpture made of branches.

He and Penny investigate the nearby house where the stranger lives, and find a hidden basement filled with even more strange sculptures. Penny finally figures out who it is -- the famous artist known as ""Mr. Jones."" Nobody knows his true identity -- he just mails his creations to people.

With information and access that nobody else has, Scott finally has a subject for his documentary. He begins investigating the people who know about Mr. Jones' work -- the people who received it (and are sometimes haunted by nightmares), curators, experts, and so on. But when he and Penny prepare to finish their work, they make the mistake of stealing one of Mr. Jones' sculptures... and find themselves in a nightmare of madness that threatens to destroy them.

""Mr. Jones"" is one of those movies that leaves you wondering ""... so what just happened?"" at the end, because it's genuinely difficult to figure out what is going on. One theory is the obvious interpretation, that Mr. Jones is a gatekeeper between reality and a world of chaotic nightmares -- one of many. Any disruption to his bizarre sculptures twists the fabric of reality, letting the horrors of that other world seep into the mind.

The other is that Scott (who repeatedly mentions that he's stopped taking his medication) is having a psychotic break. The artwork symbolizes his pills. Mr. Jones (and possibly Penny) is a different part of his personality. And the world of dreams, darkness and chaos is his own diseased mind, infecting the ""ordinary"" world and threatening his sense of self.

Whatever interpretation is ""right,"" the movie is a genuinely creepy experience. Director Karl Mueller makes pretty good use of the found-footage format -- the first act is about the two of them scuttling around, finding weird sculptures and getting spooked by Mr. Jones. It's terrifying just because it's easy to imagine yourself in a bogeyman's house, knowing he could return at any moment.

After spooking us with Mr. Jones, his creepy art and his empty house, Mueller presents us with actual information about him. The second act is basically a mini-documentary, where Scott interviews various people about Mr. Jones. And of course, it makes things creepier. Then the movie veers sharply into a hallucinatory, nightmarish experience, presented in a minimalist manner. No monsters or CGI, just slanting swooping cameras, whispering voices, and an endless night filled with storms.

Unfortunately, Mueller abandons the found-footage format in the third act, which is... disorienting. Scott simply puts the camera down, and suddenly it's zooming and floating around like a regular omniscient camera. It makes you wonder why he didn't take that approach from the beginning, and just splice in the footage when it's relevant.

Mr. Jones is only glimpsed a few times, and never clearly. But he dominates the entire movie through sheer force of mystery. Is he a villain? A savior? A guardian? A monster? Is he one person or many? We're never told, and that ambiguity makes him even more fascinating. Jones and Foster give pretty good performances, especially for terror -- both the fright of someone sneaking into a forbidden place, and the creeping horror as reality starts to implode around them.

""Mr. Jones"" struggles with the split format and a slightly choppy narrative, but it has a powerfully eerie presence and a fascinating, ambiguous end. While not perfect, it's certainly a good little low-budget horror movie.",1401408000,4,4417,5.070247933884297

6262696,2,B00IF8Q8XC,"Quite a mixed bag here. The movie starts off well and has some moments of genuine creepiness, some unsettling images. Unfortunately,  once one of the talking head interviewees explains some of the background mythology, the dream world, etc; it becomes very obvious where the story is going, and getting there is blisteringly frustrating.

The movie itself, even though it has an engrossing set up, suffers from the writer/ director switching genres mid stream, at will, to the point of being just irritating - NOT the daring, inventive kind of story telling they wanted to accomplish.  Even the opening of this ""found footage"" movie uses a traditional narrative and internal voice overs

 The movie moves from ""found footage"" to traditional narrative and back again. The movie turns in on itself to a ridiculously confusing degree, to the point where we're spending time in dreamland and really couldn't care what happens to who or when or where or what.

The ending is the ending we thought we'd get an hour earlier, no surprise, but that's OK. If getting there had been interesting or as moody and unsettling as the first 45-50 minutes it would have been great.

Someone described it as a ""David Lynch Lovecraft movie"" and that is pretty apt.  Just like David Lynch loves to toss out any kind of coherent narrative in favor of just being ""arty"", this movie just needlessly falls apart in the last 25 minutes.",1401062400,2,1410,4.870292887029288

It isn't until the last 30 minutes does the intensity factor go anywhere.

6262726,2,B00IF8Q8XC,"Rarely do I ever finish watching a movie and truly wish I could regain the ninety or so minutes I spent taking it in. It takes a lot for me to completely write off a film. Unfortunately, Anchor Bay's ""Mr. Jones"" is one of those rare dead weights which cause me to flip the TV off in despair and regret. The only thing I can compare the experience to is watching paint dry or a form of Chinese water torture.

Scott and Penny move out to the wilderness in order to film a nature documentary. The two soon discover they're not as alone as they thought they were. While exploring the land they live on, the couple stumble upon a mysterious man living in seclusion. Could he be the eccentric artist known to the world as Mr. Jones?

""Mr. Jones"" is a hodge-podge of found footage and faux-interviews that quickly becomes tiresome and annoying. I really enjoyed Writer/Director Karl Mueller's work on the apocalyptic film ""The Divide,"" but this movie is a true test in patience and endurance. I literally spent the last twenty minutes of the movie wondering where it was going storywise and how it could take sooo long to get there.

I would like to add that Mueller does provide some nice visual work through his influence on Director of Photography Matthew Rudenberg. While the images might shake around like they were shot during an earthquake, there's still a disturbing dynamic to them that could work if utilizing an actual mounted camera.

Jon Foster and Sara Jones play the lead characters of Scott and Penny. They do an admirable job of arguing with each other and running around in a panic from every noise and shadow that falls across their paths. The rest of the supporting cast is made up of actors from different television shows and movies carrying on about the enigmatic Mr. Jones.

""Mr. Jones"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition and Widescreen (1:78.1) with Dolby TruHD 5.1 surround sound. It looks great and every weird noise and atmospheric bump and thump surrounds the viewer in a state of panic. Imagine finding old video camera footage lying around that somehow looks pristine and sounds incredible. Pretty far-fetched, eh?

A rating of PG-13 is given to ""Mr. Jones"" for terror, frightening images, a scene of sexuality, and brief language. There's no nudity to be found. Even though it says there's brief language, the ""F"" word is used at least once or twice.

As far as special features are concerned, ""Mr. Jones"" comes up empty. There's nothing here to explain anything. It would surely help with a chaotic and cerebral mess like this. I can't believe Director/Writer Karl Mueller wouldn't sit down and provide commentary for the movie. Any filmmaker would take the time to do that, so it must have had something to do with the budget for manufacturing the Blu-ray and DVD release.

""Mr. Jones"" will no doubt find a cult following who enjoys its trying blend of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Jeepers Creepers,"" and ""Jacob's Ladder."" I think most fans of the horror genre will be like me. They'll be cursing themselves for not finding a better way to spend the ninety minutes that slipped through your fingers while watching this. I think Director/Writer Karl Mueller has what it takes to put together an entertaining film, but this isn't it.",1399593600,4,3261,4.75929203539823

You have been warned so if you waste your money and believe all the lies being told about how good this junk heap of a movie is then don't be angry at no one but yourself!!!!",1399507200,,484,4.052083333333333
6262728,5,B00IF8Q8XC,"I am not a big fan of the ""found footage/shaky cam"" genre, but occasionally one rises above the dreck of that genre and this is one of them. I can now finally forgive the writers/producers/directors that subjected me to the Blair Witch Project.  Karl Mueller is a writer/director that I am going to watch.  Great story, good acting, excellent editing and phenomenal sets.  I am adding this one to my library.",1399420800,4,408,4.71830985915493

8641780,4,B00IF8Q8XC,"The first and third half of this movie has some of the best ""breathe in, breathe out"" dream synthesizing I've ever seen committed to film.  The two lead actors weren't the greatest I've ever seen--they act like really annoying art students who freak out about everything--but the concept realizes itself and there are also some actually terrifying moments in it.  Very, very good.",1530748800,,380,5.015873015873016

That of course the art world who hate are now love this loony. I was hoping everyone would die. I started to wish it was a video game and I could help kill them.",1528588800,,280,4.109090909090909
8641783,4,B00IF8Q8XC,"It just doesn't snap together, seems a bit forced, like the writer set up the story but wasn't 100% sure where to go with it. It's never made really clear why Mr. Jones sent his scarecrows out to random people, for instance. And the connection between Mr. Jones and the couple, which clearly goes deeper than it first seems, is never fleshed out in a satisfactory way. And why does this guy have to become Mr. Jones? What, exactly, is Mr. Jones protecting us from? What's with all the time loops? They are all digestible paradigms we've seen a million times, but there are too many of them competing for our attention. Sarah Jones, the lead actress, is really super, hope to see her again. And the film, overall, is super creepy/ominous.",1525046400,,737,4.590909090909091
8641784,4,B00IF8Q8XC,"This is well acted and ingrossing. The problem comes when they start doing stupid things. By that, I mean things no one would do. Imagine you go out into the wilderness, completely unarmed, stay at a cabin with your wife and find out that Charles Manson is staying in a house near you. Just you two and him. What would you do?
Some of it is so counterintuitive that it pulled me out of the movie. I still watched it but if you don't like this type of movie, be warned.",1524614400,,468,4.153846153846154
8641785,4,B00IF8Q8XC,"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. They did a good job of making the dream (or nightmare) sequences feel like actual nightmares. I feel they were able to adequately translate nightmares onto the screen. The movie is definitely more creepy than scary, which I liked. It doesn't resort to ""cheap scares"" to leave you with the feeling of dread. There were a couple of ideas in this film they could have expanded on more, that would have made the movie better in my opinion. For example, they briefly touch on medication being missed in the beginning. I feel they could have expanded on this more and included it into the plot. I feel like there was a missed opportunity there but it's not enough of an issue to affect my review too much. Finally, let me just say, the scarcrowsor horrifying and I love how they take them from being just creepy and mysterious to being an almost reassuring sight. I really appreciate when a movie can take something meant to be one thing and guide you into feeling a certain way about it, and then flip that on its head. I guess the same could be said for Mr. Jones.",1520553600,,1092,4.410891089108911
