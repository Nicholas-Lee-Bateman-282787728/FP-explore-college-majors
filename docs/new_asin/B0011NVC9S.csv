3067773,5,B0011NVC9S,"There's something about the old tv shows and movies.  Oh yes, they are very dated, but such fun.  They seem like yesterday (or a million years ago), I'm not sure which.  Simple, corny, nostalgic, and fun.  I wish I could blink my eyes and go back.... enjoy!",1208649600,2,257,4.404255319148936
3067774,4,B0011NVC9S,Didn't mind paying the price for such a great collection.  I own both volumes from season one.  I look forward to buying more episodes in the future and I hope to see them out soon.,1206921600,2,181,4.142857142857143
3067775,5,B0011NVC9S,"As a young child in the late 1960's I had a vague memory of the theme song and the fireworks. However, the second I saw the information on the DVD release I pre-ordered.

I was amazed at the great tv star lineup. I was thrilled to see a young Joan Van Ark among others. Seeing this show with its fantastic guest star list makes me realize how far the talent base has fallen in Hollywood. Where have the good writers gone?

Purchase both DVD sets you will not be disappointed. Great entertainment that took us into the 1970's.",1206403200,,525,4.346938775510204
3067776,5,B0011NVC9S,"The first half of Season 1 was fun to watch and now we have the second half with more love and more joy.  Like the first volume, I've seen many of these stories in their syndicated form on TV Land and Oxygen and was amazed that they trimmed these down a bit so seeing these stories for the first time complete is another plus.  Like others, I am a little displeased that they would split seasons but charge for the price of a full one.  Perhaps when Season 2 is released, they will release it as one set  due to the fact that the show was cut back to 30 min for half of the season.  In addition, some of the  episodes were a bit on the grainier side than Volume 1, but that's probably expected since the show is almost 40 years old.

Anyhow, it was great to see stars like Steve Allen, Greg Morris (of another Paramount hit TV show MISSION IMPOSSIBLE), Vivian Vance (Ethel Mertz of I LOVE LUCY), a young Burt Reynolds, the beautiful Phyllis Davis (who will join the LAS players in Season 2), Julie Newmar, Joanne Worley (Laugh-In), Jim Backus and Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island), a young Kurt Russell, Mouseketeer Don Grady, and Room 222's Karen Valentine.

The blackouts get funnier and funnier (and a bit racier) and Charles Fox' score gets groovier and groovier, too.  And yes, The Cowsills' rendition of the theme song (which is now stuck in my head).

Hurry up and release Season Two, please and this time, all in one set since most of the episodes were 30 min in length for most of the Season",1205193600,18,1497,4.371841155234657
3067777,5,B0011NVC9S,"This show was part of ABC's Friday night line-up back when networks put their good shows on Friday and Saturdays, as opposed to today when those nights are burial grounds for failing TV shows. It was popular in the late 60's and early 70's not just because it was witty, but because it was considered a bit naughty. In fact it was put on last in the evening in the lineup and given a great big warning label - for mature audiences only. For modern viewers, this show will seem much like a precode film from the early 1930's - you'll wonder what the big deal is since by and large nothing shocking ever really happens. Like precode films it does mark a transitional period. Precodes were the last hurrah of controversial material in the movies for the next 30 years. Love American Style marked the first inroad of controversial material on TV, as bigger and bigger shocks would be required to titilate audiences until now, almost 40 years later, the show appears quaint. You just have to remember that at the time this show aired shows such as ""Andy Griffith"" and ""My Three Sons"" were the norm for hit Television. The 60's didn't really happen in middle America until the 70's and this show was part of the first wave of that transition, for better or worse.

The episodes themselves are still pretty humorous, and often you'll see failed pilots end up as episodes of Love American Style. The most famous example was a 1972 episode that turned out to be the pilot for ""Happy Days"", one of ABC's most successful shows of the 1970's. If you're a boomer you're bound to enjoy this set. If you are younger, it's an interesting and humorous lesson in the journey TV has taken over the years.",1201824000,35,1685,4.524590163934426
3067778,4,B0011NVC9S,"""Love American Style"" (1969-1974), best known for its classic theme song and for airing the pilot (Season Three segment ""Love and the Happy Days"") that ultimately launched the hit series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Days/dp/B000291Q3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Days</a>, was a comedy anthology series about love and romance (a rarity) featuring a combo of guest stars in comedy vignettes.

3067804,4,B0011NVC9S,"As a Boomer born in 1963 I have to say that this show was a guilty pleasure even as a small child.  I was only 6 when it first aired and even I knew that it was a silly show...but from a 6-year old mind is it was silly for different reasons.
This was sort of like a predecessor to the Love Boat TV series that followed in the 1980's.  It featured popular stars who careers were on the decline and up and coming stars who would soon be the box office draws for the next 40 years. Its vignette style of storytelling was not uncommon nor was its ""cheesiness"" even back in the time it was on...but that didn't matter becasue it was so innocent even when showing what today would be culturally disturbing ideas.
The list of guest stars over its run is amazing and can be found on wikipedia  Stars such as Harrison Ford, Sonny and Cher, Regis Philbin, Victoria Principal and Larry Hagman...the list is amazing.
The subject matter dealt with love, marriage, sex ,relationships and even ""free Love"" of ""Hippies""
Real hippies hated the show since it showed the most silly and stereotypical view of the counter culture movement.  This was middle America hippie chic and totally superficial but it was never cruel or jaded.  Kind of sweet looking at it now.
It's a shame that only one season of LAS has been released and that it has been split into two parts. Hopefully the rest will follow soon but I doubt it.
This is a show that can be enjoyed simply for it's simplicity.
A groovy blast from the past indeed :)
Enjoy
If you are old enough to remember the wonderful theme from Love American Style You probably remember the one from seasons 2 and on.  The first season Featured the Cowsills in a slightly different version.",1335398400,,1713,4.439490445859873
3067805,4,B0011NVC9S,"this show is a bit dated now, but was definitely a show for its time. the attitudes reflected here are old-fashioned and the humor sometimes corny or campy....but in between it all there were some great skits that mirrored our changing, dynamic culture in the psychedelic era of '69-'70, when these episodes originally aired. this hour-long comedy show tried to be a little spicy and push the envelope a bit, but they were still hampered by the over-zealous censorship of the time. for instance, in the episode where a new groom accidentally locks himself in a chastity belt on his wedding night, they never actually say the phrase ""chastity belt"", even though that's obviously what it is. i mean, seriously??? you couldn't say 'chastity belt' on the air back then??? still, i remember watching this show when i was a kid, and i loved it.  and it was great to relive this show and the times and attitudes it brings back. usually 3, sometimes 2 short plays an episode, with some short, corny jokes reflecting tv comedy at the time thrown in between the plays for a cheap laugh. having to deal with the sexual revolution while holding on to the values of how 'good girls' were supposed to behave at the time....balancing the values of the old while poking at the hip, mod generation....and all in good fun! sure, it's outdated now, and anyone who wasn't around at the time probably won't get it. but it's a great piece of nostalgia, and a reminder of a wonderful era that will never come back to us off screen. the little plays were reasonably well-written for tv at the time....warm, humorous and even sometimes insightful. the jokes in between showing you were about to go into or come out of a commercial break were corny, laugh-in style spoofs indicitive of the times......and seeing all the stars of the day was a sheer delight! people like bob denver, jim baccus, forrest tucker, adam west, burt reynolds, tony randall, wally cox, don grady, kurt russell, greg morris, paul lynde, kaye ballard, carolynn jones, nanette fabray, suzanne pleshette, vivian vance, penny marshall, joey heatherton, julie newmar, and the gorgeous carol wayne.......and so many more than i can remember off the top of my head......and even stuart margolin (i assume he's brother of the show's producer, arnold margolin) but stuart would later become famous in the show 'the rockford files'.
anyway, like i said.....anyone who wasn't around at the time probably won't get it.....but if you were watching tv in '69, you owe it to yourself to relive this hip, funny, psychedelic, love-injected blast from the past.  it's sweet living!",1332979200,,2611,4.865168539325842

3067811,5,B0011NVC9S,"Love American Style was 1 of the best shows ever. True, not all the stories were good. Many were downright awful, but there was usually at least one thread per episode that really got you excited about love happening to you, no matter how old or young you were. I remember when the show was part of an all-star lineup Friday nights on ABC with the Brady Bunch, Partridge Family, Room 222, and The Odd Couple. What is especially fun is to see young actors before they were really famous. My favorite stories were usually with young and attractive women getting caught up in some form of love, but even the ""older"" love stories usually had good messages attached to them. The key to enjoying this show was to never take it seriously.

Is ther a better theme song to start a TV show than Love American Style? Not for me! I am extremely disappointed that we only have season 1 available. I constantly hope that someday every season will be on DVD. There will never be another show like this one!",1298419200,9,991,4.445054945054945
3067812,4,B0011NVC9S,"In the early 70's, the comedy anthology, Love American Style (1969-74) became part of ABC's classic Friday primetime lineup that also featured The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, Room 222, and The Odd Couple.  The first season of Love American Style (LAS) is broken up into two volumes, each with 12 episodes that are not presented in chronological order, but instead are kind of arranged randomly.  Comparing the two, the material in Volume 2 is better written, clearly funnier, much more provocative, and with bigger name guest stars.

Risqu&eacute; for the times , LAS aired latenight on Mondays during the inaugural 1969-70 season.  The following year, Monday Night Football would debut in this time slot, causing LAS to switch to Fridays.  Each one hour program would typically feature three or four stories that examine different facets of male/female relationships, usually in a playful manner.  Some inventive and interesting themes are explored, including subjects like swinging, nudity, infidelity, and pregnancy.  Most of the stories are quite entertaining and fun, and feature a bevy of terrific guest stars from the era.  In between the stories, appear short comedic bits, performed by a troupe of actors, the ""Love American Style Players"".

In ""Love And Those Poor Crusaders' Wives"", Monte Markum and Dorothy Provine are newlyweds with a big problem, when on their wedding day, the groom accidentally dons an antique chastity belt and locks it in place.

Herb Edelman is hilarious as an humdrum executive whose life changes, when he gets a reputation as a swinger in ""Love And The King"".  His boss expects big things from him, but things really get wild for ""The King"" when his wife (Kathie Browne) unexpectedly returns home during one of his escapades.

Brass beds are a recurring theme featured constantly in the series.  ""Love And The Bed"" features Sue Lyon and Roger Perry as neighbors in an apartment, who both buy the same brass bed.  Disputing ownership, they both wind up in bed in their underwear, with a sandwich vending machine panel, as a divider between them.

Adam West earned a squeaky clean reputation playing Batman on TV.  That reputation takes a hit, as West plays himself in ""Love And The Big Catch"", where TV's caped crusader lusts after the teenage daughter of a friend (George Lindsay).

""Love And The Gangster"" skirts around the then touchy subject of homosexuality.  Jerry Van Dyke (My Mother The Car) is an interior decorator, that gangster Nehemiah Pershoff believes is gay.  This is the only reason he permits the decorator near his gorgeous daughter (Marianna Hill).

Tony Randall (The Odd Couple) is simply delightful, as a husband about to stray with the lovely Julie Newmar (Catwoman), in ""Love And The Big Night"".  Hilarity ensues as he tries to cover his tracks, and he begins to have second thoughts when he suspects his wife (Ann Elder) may also be cheating.

""Love And The Uncoupled Couple"", handles the subject of pregnancy and abortion with class, in one of the few stories with a really serious tone.  Greg Morris (Mission Impossible) is a medical student, and Janee Michelle is a nurse.  The unmarried lovers' relationship reaches a crisis, when they believe that a child is on the way.

In ""Love And The V.I.P. Restaurant"", Shelley Berman is about to enjoy a meal, and the scenery in an eatery featuring topless waitresses, when his wife (Kay Ballard) and a friend arrive and join him for lunch.

Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island) and Joey Heatherton (Serta Perfect Sleeper commercials) star in ""Love And The Hitchhiker"" where Denver tries his best to get close to Heatherton, who plays a free spirited health nut, who reveals the wonders of meditation.

""Love And Mister Nice Guy"" features rather insightful examination of a classic situation, where Wally Cox has a crush on a beautiful girl (Alexandra Hay), who only calls him when she has a problem.  This time it's an abusive boyfriend (Ray Danton), who has a remarkably clear understanding of the kind of man he is.

On the verge of becoming a megastar in films, Burt Reynolds (B. L. Stryker) guests with Elizabeth Ashley in ""Love And The Banned Book"", where a husband suspects his wife of infidelity.  The pair have great chemistry together, and Ashley and Reynolds would act together on several occasions, notably in the TV series Evening Shade.

Love American Style is a fun series with a lighthearted tone, that while often provocative, generally promotes moral behavior.  With a wicked funny edge, those who appreciate comedies from the early 70's, might well enjoy the trip down memory lane that this series provides.  Unfortunately, the set has no extra features, and the episodes are not subtitled.  It is also a little disappointing that since this set was released in 2007, no further seasons have been forthcoming.",1293235200,3,4836,5.011264080100125

Good quality - I have been watching this on a 52"" Sony LCD and an LG Blu-Ray player and you'd think the show was made 4 years ago not 40. Includes all the shorts with the Love American Style players and all the episodes presented with their original air dates. If you're feeling nostalgic for a simpler time, want to see some short skirts and long sideburns, then this is the collection for you. Season 1 is available in two volumes, get both if you can. Watch for the brass bed that makes an appearance in most episodes and even some of the shorts. Classic TV at its finest.

It was part of an excellent Friday night line-up that started at 7:00 pm CST with The Brady Bunch, then The Partridge Family. Eight o'clock had Room 222, then The Odd Couple. At nine it was Love American Style. This was a lot of Tv for a 7-10 year old, but it was Friday, so no school the next two days. It was slightly raunchy for it's day, so my parents always liked seeing it. The only thing about these releases is the packaging. Paramount could have let us have the slim-line cases.

 CBS Apparently has no regard for it's customers - the DVD set is poorly done. The menus look as though they were created by a first year programmer with an extremely limited imagination. And because it's the syndicated versions the episodes are in no particular order.
 Other TV series (e.g. Third Rock from the Sun) include interviews, deleted scenes, etc., and are the original uncut episodes, listed in order of original broadcast.

 I like ""Love American Style"", and other CBS series. But every CBS produced DVD set I've seen is poor quality-not worth watching, let alone buying.

I was amazed at the great tv star lineup. I was thrilled to see a young Joan Van Ark among others. Seeing this show with its fantastic guest star list makes me realize how far the talent base has fallen in Hollywood. Where have the good writers gone?

Purchase both DVD sets you will not be disappointed. Great entertainment that took us into the 1970's.",1206403200,,525,4.346938775510204
3302273,5,B0011NVC9S,"The first half of Season 1 was fun to watch and now we have the second half with more love and more joy.  Like the first volume, I've seen many of these stories in their syndicated form on TV Land and Oxygen and was amazed that they trimmed these down a bit so seeing these stories for the first time complete is another plus.  Like others, I am a little displeased that they would split seasons but charge for the price of a full one.  Perhaps when Season 2 is released, they will release it as one set  due to the fact that the show was cut back to 30 min for half of the season.  In addition, some of the  episodes were a bit on the grainier side than Volume 1, but that's probably expected since the show is almost 40 years old.

Anyhow, it was great to see stars like Steve Allen, Greg Morris (of another Paramount hit TV show MISSION IMPOSSIBLE), Vivian Vance (Ethel Mertz of I LOVE LUCY), a young Burt Reynolds, the beautiful Phyllis Davis (who will join the LAS players in Season 2), Julie Newmar, Joanne Worley (Laugh-In), Jim Backus and Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island), a young Kurt Russell, Mouseketeer Don Grady, and Room 222's Karen Valentine.

The blackouts get funnier and funnier (and a bit racier) and Charles Fox' score gets groovier and groovier, too.  And yes, The Cowsills' rendition of the theme song (which is now stuck in my head).

Hurry up and release Season Two, please and this time, all in one set since most of the episodes were 30 min in length for most of the Season",1205193600,18,1497,4.371841155234657
3302274,5,B0011NVC9S,"This show was part of ABC's Friday night line-up back when networks put their good shows on Friday and Saturdays, as opposed to today when those nights are burial grounds for failing TV shows. It was popular in the late 60's and early 70's not just because it was witty, but because it was considered a bit naughty. In fact it was put on last in the evening in the lineup and given a great big warning label - for mature audiences only. For modern viewers, this show will seem much like a precode film from the early 1930's - you'll wonder what the big deal is since by and large nothing shocking ever really happens. Like precode films it does mark a transitional period. Precodes were the last hurrah of controversial material in the movies for the next 30 years. Love American Style marked the first inroad of controversial material on TV, as bigger and bigger shocks would be required to titilate audiences until now, almost 40 years later, the show appears quaint. You just have to remember that at the time this show aired shows such as ""Andy Griffith"" and ""My Three Sons"" were the norm for hit Television. The 60's didn't really happen in middle America until the 70's and this show was part of the first wave of that transition, for better or worse.

The episodes themselves are still pretty humorous, and often you'll see failed pilots end up as episodes of Love American Style. The most famous example was a 1972 episode that turned out to be the pilot for ""Happy Days"", one of ABC's most successful shows of the 1970's. If you're a boomer you're bound to enjoy this set. If you are younger, it's an interesting and humorous lesson in the journey TV has taken over the years.",1201824000,35,1685,4.524590163934426

3302301,4,B0011NVC9S,"As a Boomer born in 1963 I have to say that this show was a guilty pleasure even as a small child.  I was only 6 when it first aired and even I knew that it was a silly show...but from a 6-year old mind is it was silly for different reasons.
This was sort of like a predecessor to the Love Boat TV series that followed in the 1980's.  It featured popular stars who careers were on the decline and up and coming stars who would soon be the box office draws for the next 40 years. Its vignette style of storytelling was not uncommon nor was its ""cheesiness"" even back in the time it was on...but that didn't matter becasue it was so innocent even when showing what today would be culturally disturbing ideas.
The list of guest stars over its run is amazing and can be found on wikipedia  Stars such as Harrison Ford, Sonny and Cher, Regis Philbin, Victoria Principal and Larry Hagman...the list is amazing.
The subject matter dealt with love, marriage, sex ,relationships and even ""free Love"" of ""Hippies""
Real hippies hated the show since it showed the most silly and stereotypical view of the counter culture movement.  This was middle America hippie chic and totally superficial but it was never cruel or jaded.  Kind of sweet looking at it now.
It's a shame that only one season of LAS has been released and that it has been split into two parts. Hopefully the rest will follow soon but I doubt it.
This is a show that can be enjoyed simply for it's simplicity.
A groovy blast from the past indeed :)
Enjoy

3302302,4,B0011NVC9S,"this show is a bit dated now, but was definitely a show for its time. the attitudes reflected here are old-fashioned and the humor sometimes corny or campy....but in between it all there were some great skits that mirrored our changing, dynamic culture in the psychedelic era of '69-'70, when these episodes originally aired. this hour-long comedy show tried to be a little spicy and push the envelope a bit, but they were still hampered by the over-zealous censorship of the time. for instance, in the episode where a new groom accidentally locks himself in a chastity belt on his wedding night, they never actually say the phrase ""chastity belt"", even though that's obviously what it is. i mean, seriously??? you couldn't say 'chastity belt' on the air back then??? still, i remember watching this show when i was a kid, and i loved it.  and it was great to relive this show and the times and attitudes it brings back. usually 3, sometimes 2 short plays an episode, with some short, corny jokes reflecting tv comedy at the time thrown in between the plays for a cheap laugh. having to deal with the sexual revolution while holding on to the values of how 'good girls' were supposed to behave at the time....balancing the values of the old while poking at the hip, mod generation....and all in good fun! sure, it's outdated now, and anyone who wasn't around at the time probably won't get it. but it's a great piece of nostalgia, and a reminder of a wonderful era that will never come back to us off screen. the little plays were reasonably well-written for tv at the time....warm, humorous and even sometimes insightful. the jokes in between showing you were about to go into or come out of a commercial break were corny, laugh-in style spoofs indicitive of the times......and seeing all the stars of the day was a sheer delight! people like bob denver, jim baccus, forrest tucker, adam west, burt reynolds, tony randall, wally cox, don grady, kurt russell, greg morris, paul lynde, kaye ballard, carolynn jones, nanette fabray, suzanne pleshette, vivian vance, penny marshall, joey heatherton, julie newmar, and the gorgeous carol wayne.......and so many more than i can remember off the top of my head......and even stuart margolin (i assume he's brother of the show's producer, arnold margolin) but stuart would later become famous in the show 'the rockford files'.
anyway, like i said.....anyone who wasn't around at the time probably won't get it.....but if you were watching tv in '69, you owe it to yourself to relive this hip, funny, psychedelic, love-injected blast from the past.  it's sweet living!",1332979200,,2611,4.865168539325842

3302308,5,B0011NVC9S,"Love American Style was 1 of the best shows ever. True, not all the stories were good. Many were downright awful, but there was usually at least one thread per episode that really got you excited about love happening to you, no matter how old or young you were. I remember when the show was part of an all-star lineup Friday nights on ABC with the Brady Bunch, Partridge Family, Room 222, and The Odd Couple. What is especially fun is to see young actors before they were really famous. My favorite stories were usually with young and attractive women getting caught up in some form of love, but even the ""older"" love stories usually had good messages attached to them. The key to enjoying this show was to never take it seriously.

Is ther a better theme song to start a TV show than Love American Style? Not for me! I am extremely disappointed that we only have season 1 available. I constantly hope that someday every season will be on DVD. There will never be another show like this one!",1298419200,9,991,4.445054945054945
3302309,4,B0011NVC9S,"In the early 70's, the comedy anthology, Love American Style (1969-74) became part of ABC's classic Friday primetime lineup that also featured The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, Room 222, and The Odd Couple.  The first season of Love American Style (LAS) is broken up into two volumes, each with 12 episodes that are not presented in chronological order, but instead are kind of arranged randomly.  Comparing the two, the material in Volume 2 is better written, clearly funnier, much more provocative, and with bigger name guest stars.

Risqu&eacute; for the times , LAS aired latenight on Mondays during the inaugural 1969-70 season.  The following year, Monday Night Football would debut in this time slot, causing LAS to switch to Fridays.  Each one hour program would typically feature three or four stories that examine different facets of male/female relationships, usually in a playful manner.  Some inventive and interesting themes are explored, including subjects like swinging, nudity, infidelity, and pregnancy.  Most of the stories are quite entertaining and fun, and feature a bevy of terrific guest stars from the era.  In between the stories, appear short comedic bits, performed by a troupe of actors, the ""Love American Style Players"".

In ""Love And Those Poor Crusaders' Wives"", Monte Markum and Dorothy Provine are newlyweds with a big problem, when on their wedding day, the groom accidentally dons an antique chastity belt and locks it in place.

Herb Edelman is hilarious as an humdrum executive whose life changes, when he gets a reputation as a swinger in ""Love And The King"".  His boss expects big things from him, but things really get wild for ""The King"" when his wife (Kathie Browne) unexpectedly returns home during one of his escapades.

Brass beds are a recurring theme featured constantly in the series.  ""Love And The Bed"" features Sue Lyon and Roger Perry as neighbors in an apartment, who both buy the same brass bed.  Disputing ownership, they both wind up in bed in their underwear, with a sandwich vending machine panel, as a divider between them.

Adam West earned a squeaky clean reputation playing Batman on TV.  That reputation takes a hit, as West plays himself in ""Love And The Big Catch"", where TV's caped crusader lusts after the teenage daughter of a friend (George Lindsay).

""Love And The Gangster"" skirts around the then touchy subject of homosexuality.  Jerry Van Dyke (My Mother The Car) is an interior decorator, that gangster Nehemiah Pershoff believes is gay.  This is the only reason he permits the decorator near his gorgeous daughter (Marianna Hill).

Tony Randall (The Odd Couple) is simply delightful, as a husband about to stray with the lovely Julie Newmar (Catwoman), in ""Love And The Big Night"".  Hilarity ensues as he tries to cover his tracks, and he begins to have second thoughts when he suspects his wife (Ann Elder) may also be cheating.

""Love And The Uncoupled Couple"", handles the subject of pregnancy and abortion with class, in one of the few stories with a really serious tone.  Greg Morris (Mission Impossible) is a medical student, and Janee Michelle is a nurse.  The unmarried lovers' relationship reaches a crisis, when they believe that a child is on the way.

In ""Love And The V.I.P. Restaurant"", Shelley Berman is about to enjoy a meal, and the scenery in an eatery featuring topless waitresses, when his wife (Kay Ballard) and a friend arrive and join him for lunch.

Bob Denver (Gilligan's Island) and Joey Heatherton (Serta Perfect Sleeper commercials) star in ""Love And The Hitchhiker"" where Denver tries his best to get close to Heatherton, who plays a free spirited health nut, who reveals the wonders of meditation.

""Love And Mister Nice Guy"" features rather insightful examination of a classic situation, where Wally Cox has a crush on a beautiful girl (Alexandra Hay), who only calls him when she has a problem.  This time it's an abusive boyfriend (Ray Danton), who has a remarkably clear understanding of the kind of man he is.

On the verge of becoming a megastar in films, Burt Reynolds (B. L. Stryker) guests with Elizabeth Ashley in ""Love And The Banned Book"", where a husband suspects his wife of infidelity.  The pair have great chemistry together, and Ashley and Reynolds would act together on several occasions, notably in the TV series Evening Shade.

Love American Style is a fun series with a lighthearted tone, that while often provocative, generally promotes moral behavior.  With a wicked funny edge, those who appreciate comedies from the early 70's, might well enjoy the trip down memory lane that this series provides.  Unfortunately, the set has no extra features, and the episodes are not subtitled.  It is also a little disappointing that since this set was released in 2007, no further seasons have been forthcoming.",1293235200,3,4836,5.011264080100125
