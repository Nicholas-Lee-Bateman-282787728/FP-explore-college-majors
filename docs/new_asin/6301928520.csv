7818344,5,6301928520,"Long overdue Blu-ray release from Scream Factory of this 1974 horror film was previously paired with ""The Beast Within"" on the MGM DVD but is much better off on its own. Starring Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew as a married(in real-life too) couple who unwisely stray from their underground cavern tour only to be attacked in a cave by a mysterious bat that somehow transforms Moss into a man-bat creature who must kill, and his wife's efforts to help him escape this nightmare, if she can...  Looking its best in HD, with two theatrical trailers, a still gallery, and an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that spoofed it(for those so interested...)  Sadly no audio commentary :(

Otherwise, a must have for fans of this rather melancholy cult favorite.",1500336000,,762,4.891472868217054
7818345,1,6301928520,"The main problem w/ THE BAT PEOPLE is its astonishingly awful boredom factor. During its drawn-out beginning, Dr. John Beck (Stewart Moss) and his wife, Cathy (Marianne McAndrews) get in touch w/ their feelings, while honeymooning in a cave. Then, at last, horror strikes, when Beck is bitten by a flappy, flying rodent! Alas, just when things could get interesting, the whole movie comes to a deadening splat. For the next hour, absolutely nothing happens! A few hints of action are smothered by more dull dialogue, and Moss tries his best to look insane. Nothing. Then, about five minutes before the end credits, someone is attacked. THE END. Whew-eee! Save those eyelid-supporting toothpicks for this baby!...",1428278400,6,712,5.146551724137931
