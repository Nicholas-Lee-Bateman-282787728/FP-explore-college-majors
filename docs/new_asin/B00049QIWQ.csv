8036062,5,B00049QIWQ,"We are traveling to France in the spring and visiting the Normandy beaches and towns.  I watched this video and the old movie ""D Day"".  The coverage of the planning, execution and realities of D Day are very well done.  Comments by actual participants really ""bring it home"".  In my opinion, this is one of PBS's best documentaries.",1389744000,,332,4.672413793103448
8036063,4,B00049QIWQ,"This SECRETS OF THE DEAD episode isn't so much about the battle as it is about the preparations leading up to the battle.  Not just Rommel's frantic efforts to fortify an area of beach his superiors had been tricked into believing WOULDN'T be invaded, but the preparations made by the Allies -- a large part of it involving new seacraft (one invention in particular being a boat that could beach itself on the shore for immediate disembarkation).",1312761600,,446,4.792207792207792
8036064,2,B00049QIWQ,"This looks at the various weapons inventions designed to overcome German resistance during the years of planning that led up to the D-Day Invasion. It features some interesting recollections by veterans, but is marred by far too much recreated action by actors. There is plenty of actual footage that could have been tapped. A sequence showing a latter day effort to make a tank float is just silly and is out of place.",1237334400,3,419,4.7534246575342465
8036065,4,B00049QIWQ,"This show tells the story of D-Day, with a strong emphasis on the development of new ideas and strategies for dealing with the problems caused by launching such a large invasion. For example: the Germans installed many obstacles on the beach that would be hidden in the water at high tide.  So what did the Allies do?  Land at low tide!

The stories behind some of the new technology are reviewed in depth:  the ""Higgins Boat,"" which was modified into a landing craft; ""floating tanks,"" which would be launched at sea and hopefully would make it to the beach and lend vital support to the infantry; and Percy Hobart's many innovations for overcoming obstacles on the beaches:  the ""flail tank,"" the ""Bobbin tank,"" and more.  Also included in the program are interviews with several veterans of the battle, including one old soldier from Germany.  They share their memories of that fateful day and give the viewer an idea of what it was like to be on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944.

Four stars!",1100131200,,1000,4.674285714285714
