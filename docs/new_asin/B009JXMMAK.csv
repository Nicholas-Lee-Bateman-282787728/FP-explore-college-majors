Ok, rewind tape, watch again but this time I stand and practice what she on video say make do. For next morning wake but walk discourage. Tender for days. Maybe watch three is just watch again and deep breathe but work because weight fell and supreme energy lift!",1494892800,,371,4.391304347826087
8542320,3,B009JXMMAK,"The DVD is OK.  I am a beginner, so I expected a beginner DVD.

Two problems I have found so far.

1) The music goes from calm and soothing during the session to LOUD when you get to the menu.  I mean LOUD, LOUD, LOUD!
2) The person on the screen is supposed to be demonstrating BEGINNER yoga, but she moves as if she has been doing this for a long time, which I assume she has.  She should demonstrate throughout the entire session how a BEGINNER should do the yoga moves.  It's VERY frustrating to be doing one of the moves and look up to see her flying through like she is on amphetamines.  The voice over says to do it at your own pace, but the person on screen should follow what the voice is saying ALL THE TIME!  I'm an instructor in other things and would never think of teaching like she does.

Fix these two issues and I think the DVD would be much better.",1453507200,,866,4.076923076923077
8542321,5,B009JXMMAK,"I am so impressed with this DVD! Not only is it super easy to follow, it's perfect for any time of the day- or amount of time you have to practice. Claire and the commentator do a fantastic job of guiding you through the poses/stretches, and allow you plenty of time to reap the benefits. I really hope Claire comes out with another DVD soon, because she's absolutely fantastic.",1369526400,,378,4.492753623188406
8542322,5,B009JXMMAK,"Stretch (to improve your flexibility) is a big issue for yoga beginners like me.  This video does a great job of taking you step by step through exercise programs you can do and that do lead to improvement.  I also like the breakdown into small routines: you can do just one, or if you have more time you can do several in one exercise session.",1369526400,,344,4.276923076923077
8542323,5,B009JXMMAK,"After searching for a beginning yoga dvd, I found this one and I am so glad I did! Claire explains everything so well that it makes it easy to follow which is very important. I couldn't be more pleased.",1357344000,,202,4.205128205128205
8542324,4,B009JXMMAK,Just what I was looking for. I wanted a educational beginners yoga video that would challange mr.  This video has both.,1355097600,,119,4.666666666666667
8542325,5,B009JXMMAK,"I'm so glad I bought this because first of all I could never get myself to the gym, and this dvd is something I now flip in and use EVERY day! when I'm late for work or feeling lazy I'll only do 2 of the 10min sections but if I'm on time before work I'll do more like 4! I REALLY hope Claire puts out different ones besides ""stretch"" soon because I have this one memorized!
The way she explains it and how easy it is to choose my options makes this like the only at-home workout that has ever actually been able to HELP ME WORKOUT!
love it Claire thank you so much- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1353715200,,585,4.051724137931035
8542326,5,B009JXMMAK,"I really like this video for several reasons:
1. The exercises are actually doable. I have several other beginning yoga DVDs, and I find myself staring at the TV during half of the video because I can't actually do the poses. Claire has selected and modified poses so that they can actually be done. On the other hand, I could see if you were really good at yoga, this might be too easy for you.
2. I love how the video is broken up into 10 minutes segments by body part. Each segment is like a complete workout too with a warm up, exercises, and cool down. So If I don't have a lot of time to exercise I can easily just do a few segments and make my workout as short or long as I want. If my legs are hurting one day, I can do the leg portion and they'll feel better.
3. I just feel better. The exercises are gentle but have a level of challenge to them as well. They've definitly improved how I feel overall and I look forward to using this video several times per week.

Overall, happy with my purchase.",1350432000,3,1006,4.106598984771574
