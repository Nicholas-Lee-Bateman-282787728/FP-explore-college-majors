8551997,4,B00AIANJ5U,"Jack Jones, the Love Boat crooner, plays a washed up singer who may also be a murderer. On the predicable side but fun nonetheless. David Doyle, of Charlie's Angel fame, gives an enjoyable performance. And Jack Jones can act also. Not as gory as some of Pete Walker's previous movies relying more on plot than blod",1504137600,,314,4.625
8551998,5,B00AIANJ5U,"This is one of the best horror movies that I've seen recently due to the level of suspense, acting, story, and blood-curdling sound effects. The disc itself gave a great picture quality and clear sound, but was disappointed in the lack of English subtitles which would have been helpful. I have the DVD version.",1462924800,,311,4.777777777777778
8551999,4,B00AIANJ5U,"Director Pete Walker makes a bloody good thriller here as retired pop singer Nick Cooper (Jack Jones) decides to come out of retirement after divoricing his wife (Holly Palance) of six years. In the beginning we witness the bloody slaughter of his wife with a sickle (her hand is chopped off and face and body brutally slashed) by someone wearing a rubber witch mask. Nick's manager Webster Jones (David Doyle) sets him up in an old mansion in England to settle down and write and record some new songs. Pretty soon he begins hearing the cries and screams of a woman at night and views a rotting body in a wheelchair and then the maggot-filled head of his ex-wife (who he doesn't know is dead) in a hatbox in the basement.  He cracks up and is committed to an institution as no one else, including housekeeper Mrs. B (Sheila Keith) can see or hear the body and noises. He is then set free and sets out to solve the mystery of who is trying to drive him mad. Could it be his manager? His new girlfriend (Pamela Stephenson)? Mrs. and Mr. B (Bill Owen)? Or is he just mad, like everyone thinks? Needless to say, the denouement is outrageous (you would never guess why in a million years) and the outcome bloody and inconclusive (as the final freeze-frame accentuates). Real-life singer Jones makes a better singer than actor, but he begins to get into a groove here that makes the proceedings seem more realistic than if a professional actor were to have taken the role. There are exactly three murders here and they are bloody and shocking (especially Holly Palance's). The blood is extremely red and flows freely. Sheila Keith is no stranger to Pete Walker films, appearing in his HOUSE OF WHIPCORD and FRIGHTMARE (a.k.a. FRIGHTMARE II - both 1974), THE CONFESSIONAL (1975) and HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS (1983). Her looks could melt cement and her acting ability always induced goosebumps. This is one old lady you would not want to have as a babysitter! THE COMEBACK, also known as THE DAY THE SCREAMING STOPPED, HALLUCINATIONS and ENCORE, is one of Pete Walker's best films and I, for one, wish he would get back in the directorial chair and make the kind of films that made England famous in the 70's: namely, blood-soaked psycho-thrillers that keep you guessing and make you jump. A Karl Lorimar Video VHS Release. Also available on DVD & Blu-Ray from Redemption Films/Kino Lorber.",1410220800,,2384,4.6761904761904765
