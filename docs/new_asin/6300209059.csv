7805377,5,6300209059,"Hysterical and more politically accurate than most in government would wish to concede.  William Powell is absolutely perfect throughout.  Peter
Lind Hayes performs very well throughout as a media type temporarily led astray.  Ella Raines is cast perfectly and comes across very, very well.
Ray Collins, an Orson Welles Mercury Player, is near-perfect as the political party chieftain caught up in the chaos of a ""little black book"" with years
of detailed political compromises, that suddenly disappears.  Finally, Myrna Loy's brief appearance at the end of the film as Powell's wife is sheer
delight and a fine, fitting tribute to an ahead-of-it's-time comedy.  Holds up very, very well and highly entertaining throughout.  Well-worth the viewing!",1437868800,2,748,5.460869565217391
7805378,4,6300209059,"As a person who likes William Powell, I enjoyed watching the movie. As a political junkie, as is my husband, he LOVED the movie.",1418169600,,128,4.375
7805379,5,6300209059,"I saw this movie many years ago and simply thought it was hilarious fiction. Since then it has come to mind many times while observing shenanigans in real political party life.
I kept referring to the movie when discussing politics with my daughter. When I found it was still available, my day was made! I bought a new,  original issue (in the unopened factory wrapping) as I consider it to be a family heirloom.
I think it should be required viewing in all political science courses. It would encourage some lively and enjoyable classroom discussion.

This is from an 86 year old observer's viewpoint ...",1372723200,2,605,4.752380952380952
7805380,5,6300209059,A brilliant comedy long overdue for release on DVD.  The final scene of the movie also provides a wonderful capstone to William Powell and Myrna Loy's long on-screen partnership.,1212451200,2,178,5.137931034482759
7805381,5,6300209059,"William Powell plays a dumb-bunny US Senator who gets the idea in his head to run for President. He promises the public a 3-day workweek with 8 days pay and other ludicrous things, and looks like a shoe-in. But for years he's kept a diary in which he's recorded all sorts of crooked deals and scandalous stuff, and the night before the convention it gets stolen. When it's published, half of Washington is seen leaving for places unknown. The political satire is pretty well laid on here (it should have even been stronger), and why it's not shown more on TV is hard to figure. It's not at all a bitter brand of satire either, which is an indication of the innocence of the times (in terms of what was revealed about politicians, not that politicians were more innocent). George S. Kaufman directed.",1142121600,3,799,4.594405594405594
7805382,3,6300209059,"It manages to be highly offensive to Native Americans & women in the first few minutes. No matter, it was 1947 & nobody cared about such things.
  William Powell, highly disguised, hams it up as Senator Melvin Ashton, a dim, corrupt, basically harmless politician, until he decides to run for President. He loses his highly confidential diary in which he has written down everything about everybody.
  Chaos ensues in the search for the missing diary.
  A gentle satire on the press, big city political machines, (they resemble nothing so much as ""the mob"" in this movie) & the corrupt small brained politicians with no talent we  still seem to keep reelecting. A bit dated, to be sure, but still relevant & good for a laugh.",1085616000,6,725,4.752
7805383,4,6300209059,"I love this movie. Powell plays a boob of a senator who wants to become  president because he isn't qualified to do anything else. Among his classic lines: ""If you can't beat 'em....bribe 'em!"" I think one of the  funnier bits is when he embarks on a coast-to-coast tour to announce that  he is NOT a candidate for president.  Among the tidbits is a placcard that  says Sen. Ashton is ""against INflation, against DEflation, but FOR  flation.""  The politicians go into a panic when his diary, that  includes all the shenanigans that have been pulled over the years, is  stolen. Ella Raines is quite fetching as the reporter that tries to find  the diary before the politicians get it back. I doubt there's anything in  that diary that hasn't been revealed about real-life politicians in the  1990s.  Parts are a bit dated (like reporter Raines going steady with the  senator's campaign manager, which is a conflict that would get a reporter  fired nowadays), but a lot of the digs at the political system are as true  today as they were then.",932515200,29,1041,4.668508287292818
