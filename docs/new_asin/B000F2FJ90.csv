8116526,3,B000F2FJ90,"I'm an intermediate stepper.  I can do the Work it off Cardio Sculpt, with a few of my own modifications to their crazy moves in the cardio segments.... I can do the first 10 minutes of Step It Off part 1, and I can do the pilates section at the end of the Work It off Cardio Dance.  The pilates is the best part of the whole 4 pack.

The most annoying thing about the DVD's is that they are not chaptered, oh... and I'm not super fond of the instructors.

They have made this set impossibly hard to follow along with, they don't spend enough time teaching the complicated moves before stringing them along into a 10 move combo.  Very high intensity.

The pro's--
Pretty good cardio and weight workout (Work it off Cardio Sculpt)
Good Pilates Segment at the end of Work it Off Cardio Dance
**If you are super advanced and can keep up with the insanity, you will get an incredibly awesome workout.

Cons-
The moves get too complicated, too fast
Not enough instruction and modifications
DVD's not chaptered
Not fond of the instructors

This 4 pack was cheap enough that I don't completely regret buying it, since I do throw in some of the segments into my routine once or twice a week.  Maybe when I get in better shape, I can keep up with it more.

Overall, I like Cathe a heck of a lot more for both step and weight workouts. And for Pilates, I recommend ""Classical Pilates Technique.""",1187136000,,1385,4.375
8116527,2,B000F2FJ90,"Out of this four-pack, I only liked the Work it Off Cardio Dance DVD.  The other three DVD's all include step aerobics and while I am a very expereinced stepper, the choreography here was frustratingly impossible.  It was so ridiculous that I did not even want to take the time to learn it.

The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is that I really like the cardio dance DVD and I love the bonus 30 minute pilates segment included.  The rest of the 4-pack sucks.",1172275200,,461,4.264367816091954
