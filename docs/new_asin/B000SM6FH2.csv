8205841,5,B000SM6FH2,"This is quite a delightful DVD showing many inns in New England. When I began watching I thought, ""Oh, this is gonna be dull,"" but in a short while I was enjoying it very much. The inns shown here are very attractive, and the DVD gives a good idea of the appearance of each inside and out, while discussions with the owners provide historical and other information. The host, Judith Moen, manages to be elegant and gracious without seeming pompous or stuffy about it all. While the focus always remains on the inns, she also provides variety by visiting a good number of other sites and showing scenery in each area. Camerawork is well done, and the picture quality is decent though not extremely sharp as a Blu-ray disc could be. Even though I watched it on a 50-inch Vizio high definition TV I never felt like the image was unacceptable. Run time is a generous 1 hour 45 minutes, and by the end of it I wanted to travel to New England in person, preferably with Judith as my guide.",1465776000,,983,4.43646408839779
