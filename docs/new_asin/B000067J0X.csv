8323810,4,B000067J0X,"First of all this VIOLENT COP got nothing to do with the KITANO's classic. This one is directed by STEPHEN CHEUNG and has been released in the late nineties.

The story goes like this : Johns are found dead on Portland street ( the infamous HK prostitutes spot ). The killer seems to follow a crazy christian ritual since the victims are found with an austin stuck in their mouth, a cross tatooed on their tongue and... oh yeah, they re castrated too.

One cop run into the murderer while he's doing his dirty business. He chases the bastard into a nightclub where other cops are partying. All of a sudden, a bunch of other killers break in and fire the place with machine guns. The chasing cop get accidently shot in the head by his cop buddy ( MICHAEL WONG ) who happens to be there. He ends up in a coma. The falting cop swears to avenge his friend by catching the cross killer he was after. He eventually hook up with a small time pimp ( the great ANTHONY WONG ) and the rest... Well, you gotta see it.

This flick can be confusing because of the editing. I mean, you get to see some characters for a while then it switches to some others for half an hour without you being always able to make the connection. It can be annoying at times but it always make sense in the end and it's quite smart.  Don't raise your hopes too high for violence, this is IIb not III category. It means there's blood but the typical HK way not the insanely shoking UNTOLD STORY way.

Overall the STEPHEN CHEUNG's VIOLENT COP rocks. there's action, shootouts, murders, holy water torture, some gansters, a crazy maniac even a litle bit of soft SM and ANTHONY WONG who steals the show as always. I guess that now you know if you want to watch it.",1122595200,,1727,4.285276073619632
