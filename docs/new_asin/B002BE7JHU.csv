3893278,5,B002BE7JHU,My grandson was really excited about watching this movie - he is just beginning to like mystery/scary type movies and these are just right for his age group,1355702400,,156,4.607142857142857
3893279,4,B002BE7JHU,"Bought this video for my kids. they are a big fan of Goosebumps. We all enjoyed this one . As always it was appropriate for kids--not TOO scary or gory, just enough to make it fun!",1355702400,,180,4.027777777777778
3893280,5,B002BE7JHU,"This DVD has a creepy cover and includes three 22 minute episodes from the 90s Goosebumps series that are based on the books by R.L.Stine.

Stephanie and Duane love a good haunt, but they get more than they bargained for in The Headless Ghost when they enter into the Hill House!

Awesome Ants is one crazy story! Dave's science project is an ant farm. He orders a special kind of food for it that turns the ants into giants!

Becca's science class is going on a overnight nature adventure (What School Does This?), but she is in for a sssurprise!

These are three great episodes that your kids will love!",1346284800,,605,4.472727272727273
3893281,5,B002BE7JHU,"This DVD has three 20-minute videos:  the headless ghost, the ants, and a camping story with a snake.  They are scary enough to be fun without being offensive.  The little boy I got it for liked the one about the ants the best; he got so scared that he hid behind a corner and peeked around at the tv screen -- he couldn't take his eyes off it.  Personally for me the snake story was the scariest.  I think the actors do a very good job, and the musical score is perfect for the stories, adding to the scariness.  I consider this one of the best children's videos I have watched.  It is done in good taste and provides a good hour of entertainment.",1331942400,,648,4.17741935483871
3893282,5,B002BE7JHU,"since i gave all 3 of these movies as a christmas gift to someone, i cant leave any reviews. only thing i can say is i haven't heard back from the person i gave them to, so i can assume they were viewed ok.",1325548800,,206,3.7045454545454546
3893283,4,B002BE7JHU,Everything I show any of these shows to children they all just stop and stare. It is not to scary and good mysteries.,1291852800,,117,4.130434782608695
3893284,5,B002BE7JHU,"I love this show! It's a classic! Plis, the best part is it's not scary like blood and guts! It's fun scary for kids and teens! This DVD out of the two that were released back in September of 2009 was awesome!

""The Headless Ghost"" was great! Especially making the main character be like ""This isn't a good idea""

""Awesome Ants"" gave me chills! Imagining big bugs like that is kind of creepy!

""Teacher's Pet"" was really cool, too. It also has a ""In Memory of"" for the girl who played Becca.

So I would definitely recommend this DVD for those who like to be scared and/or don't like gory movies.",1275436800,,596,4.342342342342342
3893285,4,B002BE7JHU,"If you have any of the other Goosebumps DVDs, then you already know what to expect;  you get a handful of episodes, without any sort of supplemental material.  The audio and video are decent, but there's nothing here that's going to blow you away.  I really wish they would just start releasing Goosebumps in season sets, instead of stringing us along with these single disc offerings.

The worst thing about this DVD is the packaging.  The DVD comes in the new ""eco-friendly"" (aka cheaper to manufacture) DVD case that have large wedges cut from the plastic, both behind the disc, and on the side where the liner notes go.  Yes, it may be eco-friendly to use less plastic on the case, but it also leaves the disc inside much less protected from dust and scratches.

Instead of offering a cardboard slip case, the manufacturer went with a totally bizarre piece of cardstock pasted on top of the shrinkwrapping.  First off, the image on the card is exactly the same as the one that's underneath, on the case, so there's really no reason for this.  Second, once you remove the card from the shrinkwrap (it's attached with rubber cement), it doesn't even fit inside the case.  You can wedge it inside the clear plastic piece on the outside of the DVD case....but once again - what's the point of this thing anyway?  This is really the most absurd DVD packaging I've seen recently.  Come on Scholastic, just give us a real slipcase next time.

As for the episodes themselves - we get three solid offerings this time.  ""Awesome Ants"" was probably the best of the trio, with a really great twist ending that would be at home on the Twilight Zone (although the giant ant puppets used in this episode are about as convincing as the monsters in a Godzilla movie).  ""Teacher's Pet"" is also a notable episode, because the lead actress, Michele Risi (playing the role of Becca), passed away shortly after filming.",1257552000,,1901,4.666666666666667
3893286,5,B002BE7JHU,"This DVD contains 3 scary episodes from the R.L. Stine collection.  These episodes are short (about 20 minutes each), so the whole DVD can be viewed in one sitting.  My children are big fans of the ""Goosebumps"" DVDs, and this one is one of the best.

The first episode is entitled ""The Headless Ghost"".  Duane and Stephanie are frequent visitors to Hill House; an old mansion that is rumored to be haunted.  During one of their visits, they stumble across the ghost of a young boy who lost his head.  Now, he's come for one of theirs!

In episode 2, entitled ""Awesome Ants"", pals Dave and Ben decide to grow an ant farm for their science project.  Ignoring the instructions not to overfeed the ants, the boys begin feeding them hot dogs and any other thing they can find.  Soon, the ants are overrunning the house.

The third and final episode is entitled ""Teacher's Pet"".  Becca is excited about going on an overnight camping trip with her science class.  However, once at the campground, Becca discovers some really strange animals.  It turns out that the camp science teacher is doing a little cross-breeding, and Becca is on the menu!

As with the other DVDs in the ""Goosebumps"" series, the episodes contained on this DVD are scary, but not so much as to give young kids nightmares.  My three children, ages 10, 8, and 6, really enjoy watching this series.  The stories are spooky and the kids really enjoy them.

I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  The stories are scary, and children will surely enjoy watching them.",1257379200,18,1530,4.666666666666667
