2803276,5,B000OYC794,"I had forgotten the Loretta Young shows on TV until  I saw them available on DVD. But I remember seeing and enjoying them. - She was one of my favorite actresses. I didn't realize that she had 8 seasons. How beautiful she was as she swept into the room in her lovely gown to introduce each one-half hour black and white episode with a moral theme. The 2nd disc really brought back memories regarding the show where the husband was in an iron lung in the home in Los Angeles during the 1952 earthquake. I was 22 and just moved into a small bungalow and remember my bed rolling. I had only seen iron lungs in hospitals in the newsreels, but that show was a reminder of the medical advances and the dedication of caregivers. Her ""bonus"" home movies alone are historical and interesting and worth the cost of her first two seasons.  BW",1250985600,6,831,4.3896103896103895

2803278,5,B000OYC794,"I received this set from Amazon and was thrilled to watch the first season of ""Letter To Loretta"".  However, it turned out that Disc 3 was labeled correctly, but contained the same program as that on Disc 2.  So I advise you to CHECK the discs and make sure that you've gotten all three discs that have different content on each!",1242691200,12,329,4.377049180327869
2803279,4,B000OYC794,"They did a great job restoring the picture and sound, and the stories are wonderful. I've been a Loretta Young fan for years and I've always wanted to see her television show. As the previous reviewer stated, there are four episodes missing (which was a bit disappointing) but it's still a good buy. I've enjoyed it very much!",1231891200,6,326,4.637931034482759
2803280,4,B000OYC794,"My mom always loved this show, and always spoke highly of it, so when I saw it on the familynet schedule a couple of years ago, I tuned in to check it out. And after seeing one episode, I was hooked . . . what a fantastic series, and I'm a guy!  There are many great stories in the Loretta Young Show. In this season, for instance, there is an episode where a couple's car is rear-ended. The drivers exchange information and the guy in the wrong goes crazy and starts terrorizing the couple. The shows always have a moral or message to them, and are uplifting.  The downside to this dvd set is that it is missing 4 of the episodes of season two, and the dvd's are from 50 year old prints, so the sharpness and sound sometimes aren't the best, but don't let that stop you from buying it. The stories are great and Loretta Young has got to be one of the most talented and beautiful actresses ever!",1188259200,38,895,4.1976744186046515
8187396,5,B000OYC794,My two sisters and I watched every episode of The Loretta Young show.  We used to guess whether she would come out of the doorway in a short or long dress.  We were little girls and looked forward to every show.  I was so happy to see the DVDs for sale on Amazon and just received Season 2 yesterday.  Can't wait to watch them again.,1522454400,,333,4.076923076923077

8187404,5,B000OYC794,I bought the season 2 disc of Loretta Young's TV show because my wife talked often of how much she enjoyed watching it as a little girl.  After receiving it and watching a few shows she was overwhelmed with joy and memories.  Somehow TV in those days excited an enthusiasm for life that few of today's can even approach.,1327276800,,320,4.406779661016949
