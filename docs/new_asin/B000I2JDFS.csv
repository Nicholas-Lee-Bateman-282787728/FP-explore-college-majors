2652344,5,B000I2JDFS,"While this item is a must have for the true die-hard Pistons fan, I say this only because this is the only other Detroit Pistons DVD available on the market other than their 2003-04 Championship DVD.  The picture/format quality could have been better considering this is a DVD and not VHS and the editors erroneously referred to Chicago's home court in 88-89 as the United Center.  The Bulls did not open the United Center until 95-96!  Enough said.",1241049600,2,449,4.730769230769231
2652345,5,B000I2JDFS,"Fairly well video package. Excellent video quality!!! Could have included the actual telecast intros as there is no real pre-game setup for the viewers, no buildup to anticipation of a possible must-win, great scoring(MJ, Isiah,etc)performance! Still, a good package, like going back-in-time and reliving that action, the REAL Bad Boyz!!!!!",1209168000,2,340,5.82
2652346,4,B000I2JDFS,"One noticeable error is that the location for Games Three, Four, and Six of the Eastern Conference Finals is listed as the United Center, which did not open until 1994; the correct location for these three games is Chicago Stadium.",1165968000,2,231,4.8
2652347,3,B000I2JDFS,"OK, I just received the set.  Whenever I buy DVDs, I make sure to put them into my DVD player to make sure they will play.  Occasionally I've gotten some DVDs that won't play.

All of the discs in this set play fine in my player, however, I did notice another problem.  The box says that all 10 games are shown in their entirety.  Well, when I put in Disc 4 (containing Game 4 of the ECF), I went to the start of the 4th quarter, and it started with 9:32 remaining in the 4th!  I thought maybe that they had put the chapter break in the wrong place, so I rewinded it a little bit.  I saw the last few seconds of the 3rd quarter, and all of a sudden it went to 9:32 of the 4th quarter.  So the first 2 minutes and 28 seconds of the 4th quarter are definitely missing.

I don't have time right now to watch all of the discs in their entirety to find out if that's the only instance of missing footage, or if there are more instances of missing footage.  But it's a little disappointing when they say that all the games are in their entirety, only to find out that that's not the case.",1165708800,5,1082,4.014018691588785
2652348,5,B000I2JDFS,"I had to buy this set strictly because it includes all six games of the 1989 Eastern Conference Finals between the Pistons and Chicago Bulls. This was the ""Doug Collins-coached/pre-Triangle offense"" Bulls, before their championship dynasty. You could see exactly how this Bulls/Pistons rivalry was starting to grow. Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant were still too young and inexperienced, so the Bulls offense heavily relied on Michael Jordan. Nevertheless, the games were intense. The upstart Bulls gave the Bad Boys their biggest challenge in the '89 playoffs. This set also includes the Pistons four-game sweep of the Lakers in the NBA Finals that spring. Detroit had one of the best backcourts at the time with Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars. Up front they had resident Bad Boys Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, plus the steady veteran Mark Aguirre. And finally, the deepest bench in the league with Vinnie Johnson, John Salley, Dennis Rodman and James Edwards. Whether you're a Bad Boy for life or MJ fan, you'll want this set just to relive the classic confrontations.",1165017600,23,1065,5.091428571428572
2652349,4,B000I2JDFS,"I am big Celtics fan, but I felt compelled to buy this set to keep my library of great basketball going.  I have all of the NBA Dynasty Series, and this set is just as good.  Great action by Jordan, Magic and all of the Pistons.",1164585600,5,228,3.9347826086956523
2652350,5,B000I2JDFS,"first this a great dvd like the other sets for other championship teams.

that said why cant these jerks just review the dvd for the quality and not bring in their personal stupid feelings. because guess what, if the players you don't like were on your team,then you would be calling them the greatest ever. that said,boy those Pistons could be dirty at times. woops i fell into the name calling trap !",1164326400,3,402,4.506849315068493
2652351,5,B000I2JDFS,"The only thing that would be better Matthew would be if it had the footage of Michael Jordan squealing the tires on his Mercedes and pouting after he was fired from the Washington Wizards.

Better yet would be if it had footage of him cheating on his wife with porn stars - Or writing the payola checks for them to shut up!

You are right - Excellent video!",1164240000,5,357,4.235294117647059
2652352,5,B000I2JDFS,"This Pistons team won championships when the NBA was at it's peak, when Bird, McHale, Magic, Barkley, Jordan, Olajuwon, Drexler, Ewing, Dominique, etc. etc. were in their prime. The Bulls, for instance, had their dynasty when the league was at it's low point . . . Jordan beating Magic, Barkley, Isiah and whoever was on the Sonics in 96 when they were all past their prime. NBA history to me is made up of the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons, and that's what makes this collection a must-have for any real fan of the game.",1163808000,13,519,4.531914893617022
2652353,5,B000I2JDFS,"I hate the Pistons and yet I'm still going to be forced to buy this because it has 6 games featuring Michael Jordan, including 5-27-89 game 3 where he scores 46-17 in the 4th and the game-winning bank shot over a helpless, inkless Dennis Rodman. Also, 6-2-89 game 6, one of Jordan's most famous moves: he steals the ball, saves it inbounds, gets it back and does a hanging, back-to-the-basket layup with a foul from Laimbeer. Could be worse, I could be forced to buy the box set for one game instead of six.",1159660800,3,507,4.404255319148936

2652414,5,B000I2JDFS,"I love Dennis Rodman and the Badboys of 1989 and this disc set shows some of their best moments.  You also get to see how awesome Michael Jordan and the Bulls were at that time along with the fierce competiveness that these teams brought to each game. Dennis Rodman was simply amazing back then; the rebounding, the quickness, the defensive prowess (of course I am bias because I am a Rodman fan) but nonetheless; he is arguably the greatest rebounder/defender of our time. Isiah Thoms was at another level of performance, even outplaying Michael Jordan to win the series.  You get to see a young Scottie Pippen who was still developing his skills as well as other key players for the Bulls and Pistons that really highlighted the team concept which won championships. Awesome video set!!",1370131200,4,788,4.786764705882353
2652415,5,B000I2JDFS,"Item was sent rather expediently and the quality of the product was excellent. Pistons of '89 were one the best defensive teams not only in basketball, but sports. It was nice to see these ECF and Finals games in entirety.",1353456000,,222,4.575
2652416,5,B000I2JDFS,"I own the Celtics set, the Lakers set and the Detroit set. Not only does the Detroit set contain more games but it really showcases the talent of the NBA's hay day. Whether you're a Pistons fan or not, its worth owning to see the greats in one set. Thomas,Laimbeer, Dumars, Magic, Worthy, Jordan, and Pippen. Just a legendary set.

2652417,5,B000I2JDFS,"I am a big NBA fan(and a big Lakers fan). But i love this game and i wanted to see how the Pistons won the Bulls that is the biggist price for my.
I don't like my team lose 0-4 in the Finals but that is part of the game and it is still great to see Magic(played just 1 and a half game), Jabbar(his last 4 games) and Worthy that did his best but with out Magic and Scott this series was over(i still think with Scott and Magic that the Lakers would have won).
The Piston team look great, they played hard and smart basketball(and i love to see them beat Jordan).",1312329600,4,561,3.9298245614035086

2652419,4,B000I2JDFS,"A terrific document of the greatness of Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Mark Aguirre, Vinnie Johnson, Dennis Rodman, James Edwards, and the rest of their starters and bench.  Their defeat of Chicago in the Eastern Conference Finals really showed their amazing depth and their incredible shot making ability.

One let-down--not product related--The Lakers, in the finals, were without Magic for the last 2 1/2 games and without Byron Scott the whole finals due to injury.  Kareem, playing in his final season, was not much of a factor either (except for a big game 3), averaging about 8 points a game.

At halftime of game 4, CBS aired a tribute to Kareem that CBS's play-by-play guys said was really well done.  Including that tribute broadcast in the disc 11 special features would have added some richness to this set.",1309219200,3,814,4.912408759124087

2652421,5,B000I2JDFS,"Can you see my smile from where you are? I have been searching for anything from the Pistons repeat years and all I ever seem to find are games where the Lakers or the Bulls are beating them. I was grateful enough but a bit annoyed. So you can imagine how excited I was to find this box set from the 88-89 season. Very reasonably priced and the quality is very good considering it must have been transfered form old video tapes. Disc 11 is an overview of the entire season and is worth the price just on it's own. Now, all I need is the '89-90 season. Come on you old Pistons fans start making some noise and get this season on to disc before I get to be too old to enjoy it.

2652422,5,B000I2JDFS,"I didn't start watching the NBA until the 90-91 season so it was nice to be able to watch these games for the first time in their entirety(except one). Although I was never a fan of the Bulls, I enjoyed seeing this Bulls team right at the edge of breaking thru. I also enjoyed watching the Magic/Kareem Lakers even though they were nearing the end. A couple of the ECF games were broadcast by TBS.

This is an 11 disc set that contains the 6 Eastern Coference Finals games along with the 4 NBA Finals games from the 88-89 season. Additionally, disc 11 contains the 88-89 season recap. A few more things I enjoyed were harder fouls not being whistled as a flagrant. Players getting T's instead of thrown out after a scuffle. Also, sometimes opposing players would give a hand for a fallen opponent(don't see that nowadays). Great set. Great memories.",1258416000,13,849,4.5855263157894735
