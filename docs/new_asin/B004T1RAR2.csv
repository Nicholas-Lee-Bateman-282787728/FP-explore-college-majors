8678999,1,B004T1RAR2,"I am late to The Strokes bandwagon, and wanted to stop having to watch poor quality videos of The Strokes using YouTube.  So I thought I'd invest in a DVD that would have some of their videos.  After finding three DVDs available, and two had reviews that they clearly were not what I wanted, I gambled on this, the third (it had no review).  Sad to report the first notice on playing this DVD was ""CONTAINS NO MUSIC BY THE STROKES"".  Nothing more needs be said.",1331510400,8,461,4.325581395348837
