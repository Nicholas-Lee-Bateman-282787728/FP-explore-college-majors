7995638,5,B0000A2ZSP,"THIS NIGHT I'LL POSSESS YOUR CORPSE, the follow-up to AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL, finds COFFIN JOE (Jose Mojica Marins) returning to his mission of producing a son and heir to his legacy of eeevil. JOE kidnaps six women, tortures them w/ an army of tarantulas, and finishes off the unluckiest ones in a pit of deadly snakes. We also get a head-crushing-by-stone-slab for the son of JOE's nemesis, the colonel. TNIPYC also introduces us to Bruno, JOE's hunchback henchman. Also included, is the infamous, full color HELL sequence, complete w/ suffering souls. Again, for it's time (1966) and budget, it's a hellish masterpiece...",1355011200,2,633,5.038095238095238
7995639,5,B0000A2ZSP,"Seeing this on Independent Film Channel was a delight to me because the Portuguese was so clear and Latin-based that I didn't have to rely much on the subtitles at all.  It was a surprise to see such a creation had come out of Brazil at that point in time, because I remember that in order to see Frankenstein, Dracula, or The Wolfman, you had to be over 18.
The film did remind me of my earliest horror film experiences, but with a touch of Bunuel, and certain cult films.  The main character is so philosophical about his depravity that it is absurdly funny in contrast to
the ""common folk"" that he despises and torments.  I couldn't disagree more with the last reviewer; the primitiveness of the technical elements make it all the more enjoyable.",1208995200,3,749,4.533333333333333
7995640,1,B0000A2ZSP,"I guess it's a masterpiece if you consider things done by junior high school theater departments with no budget a masterpiece. I'd say two words descriptions-- ""Super Eight"" or ""no budget"" or ""no acting"" or ""public airwaves"" or ""styrofoam sets"" or ""Halloween costumes"". If you want this done right, rent some early John Waters movies. This is only good if you are looking for a laugh at the directors expense.",1193788800,4,409,4.857142857142857
7995641,5,B0000A2ZSP,"Previous reviewer Mr. Jolley pretty much said it all and said it perfectly.  Folks, this is not just another obscure horror movie.  This may be obscure, but it is truly a significant work of art.  I collect horror films and have several hundred in my DVD collection.  This has to be one of the most creative and bizarre.  Now, if you're dedicated to the Hollywood big-budget type of movie this may not be for you.  This is conspicuously small-budget, mostly black and white, subtitled (the speaking is in Spanish), and a little rough around the edges in general.

But, in my opinion that only adds to the charm.  This movie is genuinely scary with its depiction of true and dedicated evil.  We had to usher my two-year-old daughter to bed the minute this thing started even though she wasn't paying much attention: the vibe is so severe and demented that I didn't want her anywhere near it! I even felt a little guilty watching it!  But, it is not a gross blood-and-guts film....it is a film of shocking ideas and provocative images (including many beautiful women, snakes, spiders, graves, creepy lagoons, mortuaries, tortured occupants of hell, etc.).

Bottom-line: if you have interest in horror films and the bizarre, you MUST buy this immediately. I guess artists of comparision would be: Salvador Dali and David Lynch, but those come immediately and vaguely to mind due to their affiliations with surrealism; there are probable better comparisons that escape me right now. I have the entire trilogy (this is the third film), and they are all worth having, but this one is the best of the three.  And it completely stands well alone if you want to start here and work your way backwards through the trilogy. Oh, and this is nicely packaged: there is a nifty little comic book which accompanies the disc and adds a nice fluorish to your purchase.  The DVD extras include an interview with the director/star who I understand is still alive (forty years later) and is quite a major cult-type figure in Brazil.

In closing, this will blow you away.  Seriously trippy and terrifying. And fun as such.",1145750400,7,2100,4.778393351800554
7995642,5,B0000A2ZSP,"Ze do Caixo (better known - thanks to a mistranslation of his name - as Coffin Joe), returns in this remarkable sequel to At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul.  This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse takes up right where the first film left off, then quickly takes the story to even more audacious extremes than before.  The result is a truly visionary and shockingly bold masterpiece of psychological horror that easily earns director (and star) Jose Mojica Marins a place in the pantheon of horror's brightest lights.  Despite Ze's appearance at the end of the first film, his life is saved and his vision eventually restored.  Absolved of his former crimes thanks to insufficient evidence, Ze is soon ready and able to begin searching once more for the woman who will give him a son.  Ze's philosophy, as he continually reminds us, is centered upon the immortality of blood.  He takes existentialism to its greatest extreme, dismissing the weaklings polluting the surface of the earth with their absurd religious faith and their superstitious belief in spirits, challenging the very idea of either God or devil.  All that matters to him is the immortality of blood, and thus he yearns for a son who will grant him that immortality.  In this film, he goes even farther in his beliefs, though, characterizing himself as a sort of superman, man in his most superior form, one free to act on instinct alone; his son, he asserts, will save the human race by establishing a race of superior men.  All he needs now is to find the superior woman deserving of her role as mother of the perfect man.

The complexity of Ze is communicated wonderfully in this film.  One of his first acts after returning to a town where all men fear him is the heroic rescue of a child - proving just how genuine a love he has for children (it's just a pity they grow up and become idiots).  Ze is also smarter now.  Rather than merely choose a woman for the honor of accepting his seed, he kidnaps six prospects and tests them (it involves lots of really big spiders and isn't really the kind of test you can study for).  In a scene of gleeful sadism, he takes the winner to bed while the agonizing final moments of the unfortunate runners-up play out vividly before him and his would-be bride.  Alas, though, the woman is weak - amoral, but ultimately undeserving of Ze's gift.  Then Laura, the daughter of the well-to-do ""Colonel"" arrives in town, and in her Ze finds the superior woman he is seeking.  In a mesmerizingly perfect scene, they go at it against the backdrop of her brother's funeral.  Laura is really something else, actually bolstering Ze's strength and resolve when he discovers he has done the one thing capable of prickling his seemingly non-existent conscience.

Of course, the most famous scene in This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse is its audacious hell sequence.  Marin creates one of the most disturbing, surreal, and memorable visions of hell I've ever seen, and its magic is made even more pervasive by the fact that it, unlike the rest of the movie, is shot in color.  Marin reportedly used electric shocks to make the writhing pain of the actors appear all the more real.  Don't think that the film ends there, however; Ze's sacrilegious mania only culminates after he once more dares challenge both God and devil to prove their existence to him, staking his claim anew for eternal existence and immortality.  It all makes for a powerful ending to an outrageously audacious masterpiece (there, I said it again).

We in America didn't know what we were missing until the mid-1990s when Coffin Joe finally made its way to our shores.  Filmed in the mid-1960s, Marin's brilliant films still have the power to shock and horrify audiences.  Limited budgets did not stop Marin from introducing scenes of effective gore into these films, and the amorality of Ze is so extreme as to surprise even the most jaded of modern-day viewers.  Today's directors don't have half the vision or audacity of Jose Mojica Marins, so I would urge anyone who cares even a single bit about horror to get your hands on these Coffin Joe films and revel in their genius and power.",1114905600,6,4150,4.704011065006916
