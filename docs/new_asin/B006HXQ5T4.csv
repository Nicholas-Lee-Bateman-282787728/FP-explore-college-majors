This is a Chronicle of the great Death in Wishborg 1838

The original story is as old as the Carpathian Mountains. A real estate agent Knock (Alexander Granach) gets a mysterious request from a far-off land; Count Graf Orlok (Max Schreck) is in need of a new abode. He sends his best man Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) to seal the deal. The mysterious being, Nosferatu, has nefarious purposes that will seal more than the deal and in the process is attracted to a tasty Mrs. Hutter (Greta Schroeder).

This is the 1922 F.W. Murnau's silent German classic adaption of Brahm Stoker's Dracula. The movie follows the book little closer than today's movies do. There were a few necessary changes. I believe that was the nature of movies around 1922. Max Schreck did an excellent job of playing the deviant snacker.

Although no variations can come close to this original film, many people think of Werner Herzog's 1978 film Nosferatu the Vampyre as a good variation, This also being my personal favorite as I am a fan of Klaus Kinski. I suggest that you look at some of the others and see what you think and who you consider the real Dracula.",1516492800,,1191,4.6571428571428575

The film begins with scenes that suggest the 19th century. ""No one escapes his destiny."" Knock, the house agent, reads a strange letter from Count Orlok of Transylvania and sends his agent Thomas Kutter to finish the deal. [Do the actors seem weird?] The name of Count Orlok surprises and scares the people at the inn. A strange animal is outside (a striped hyena). Kutter goes to Orlok's castle; the sun is setting. Kutter awakes the next morning to find his meal. He has two bites on his neck, the mosquitoes are terrible there. Kutter learns the secret but is trapped until he can escape. Knock the house agent has gone mad: flies and spiders!

Ellen awaits the return of Thomas. A ship sails the Baltic Sea. One sailor falls sick, then others. The captain is last to go. What is the matter with Ellen? Count Orlok arrives in Wisburg to inhabit that house. That ship lands with no living soul aboard. Is it the plague? This results in many deaths. A mob chases Knock, blaming him for the plague. What will Ellen do to rid Wisburg of the plague? Will Orlok make the mistake of tardying before departing? Will Ellen be saved? The plague ends as suddenly as it started.

The creators of this film were sued for violating the copyright of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". They changed the names but this story tracks ""Dracula"". This appears to be a low budget film. Setting this story in the 19th century seems more credible than the 20th century. The fall in 1921 for agricultural prices was worldwide. Does a recession create a market for horror pictures? The 1932 Hollywood film ""Dracula"" remains the classic version of this story. [Were the ears of ""Mister Spock"" copied from Orlok?] Horror stories like these died out after victory in WW II and the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. Horror films then were based on ""science"" (like giant ants or invaders from space). Will more horror films be produced in the current recession? One consolation is that horror films will never become a TV series.

In this and other films the bite of a vampire is shown as two small punctures about 3 cm apart. That represents a small mouth like a snake or small animal. How much blood could be extracted that way? Would there be enough calories? If not, that is proof for the non-existence of vampires.",1512000000,,2304,4.639705882352941
