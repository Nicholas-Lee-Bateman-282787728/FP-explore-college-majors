8568155,3,B00BGGIU68,"""Wife Husband Friend"" is an unusual film. The first impression is that this is a pleasant comedy whereby Loretta Young thinks she can sing and wants to, Warner Baxter doesn't know he can and does, and Binnie Barnes is a singer who pushes Baxter into performing, only because she wants him for herself.  What makes the film so strange is that while Baxter is very good and carries all of the amusing moments, supported by some indispensible supporting actors like George Barbier, Barnes is so predatory that it is a wonder the film escaped the censors. Young is her usual charming self but her part is not funny and the scene in which she and Baxter have a fight is surprisingly violent. Also, Baxter goes on a binge and the scene in the crummy hotel is very dour.  Both woman look stunning and wear some magnificent clothes. The film was just about the last (1939) in Loretta Young's contract at 20th Century Fox and contributed to Young leaving.  She had played this sort of nothing role many times there.

The film has been issued in the Fox Archives collection which means there are no extras, no scene selection, no nothing.  The print is adequate. It was also remade 10 years late as ""Everybody Does it"" and this was a more polished production in every way.",1440633600,4,1262,4.591111111111111
