7978632,4,B000083C85,"My daughter has been to Jason's camps, including the Point Guard Elite Camp.

The camps are intense for serious players.

His DVD's are accurate representations of some of the drills and activities done at that camp.

Excellent material for learning how to drive, dribble and move.

My daughter reviews these DVD's to keep her focused on what she learned from his camps and to motivate her to implement it in her game.

Only 4 stars because some of it seems redundant, but worth it if you're serious about improving your game.",1363651200,,526,4.736263736263736
7978633,4,B000083C85,"With AND1 hysteria sweeping the nation, it's tough to play a game at the rec and not have a ""Hot Sauce"" wannabe want to pull a move on someone. Most of these guys find out it's not so easy to pull of the move with someone actually playing hard D on you.
Enter EBC 2, a collection of footage from the recent Entertainer's Basketball Classic, the tournament of tournaments for most ballers. The level of skill is remarkably higher than that displayed in the AND1 tapes, where they played locals with little or no motivation to stop their opponents. So when The Bone Collector or A Whole Lotta Game pulls a so-called ""AND1"" move--slicing through the lane with a windmill lefty layup or shaking a defenders outstretched hand before shooting--it's all the more spectacular. Not only is the skill level through the roof, with NBA players lke Stephon Marbury, Jermaine O'Neal, Shawn Marion, Baron Davis, Derek Anderson, Jason Richardson, Cedric Henderson, Kenny Satterfield and Kobe Bryant making appearances, winning the championship is actually a goal.
Notice the emphasis on tough threes, get-em-out blocks, and disgusting hangtime oops; these are skilled players pulling off hotdog moves either because they have to or because they've got the balls to. You aren't humiliating chumps, you're trying to dunk or dribble through Ron Artest, Jamaal Tinsley and a host of streetball legends.
The conversational cuts in between the highlights could be done away with; it seems like the tournament directors and regulars are forcing face time. The music is a definite plus, intercut perfectly with the crowd's oohs and aahs. The DVD also plays the championship game in near-entirety, a definite plus if you don't think you can make it to the Rucker to watch the EBC live in your lifetime. There's also a easy to navigate section of the best dunks and moves of the tournament.
Which brings up the sad fact that championships can be bought, and that like the AND1 series, going mainstream will only water down streetball. Fat Joe's Terror Squad disgustingly buys the championship by putting together a roster composed largely of NBA players and ghetto superstars from other teams to convincingly take ""the Chip.""
It's a must have for the basketball fan though. It's your last chance to see streetball moves busted out in a rough-and-tough environment, where nothing comes for free. It's AND1 in a real tournament...go out and get it before the other guy does.",1052265600,12,2446,4.982885085574572
7978634,5,B000083C85,"I just looked at this new street ball DVD with my buds and we were all blown away. I've collected all the tapes out there, and some are really cool, but this Rucker Park one slams on all those others. Why? Because its the only one that has KOBE and other NBA starz like Iverson, Marbury, Marion going toe to toe with these sick street ballers like Bone Collector, Tank, Whole Lotta Game, and some others whose names I can't remember. These guys do some insane stuff in this Rucker Park tornament up in Harlem USA. Plus, it came with a bangin' free CD with Fat Joe, Moe Mansun, Mobb Deep, which I didn't even no I was getting till I opened the box. Nobody be sorry they pick this one up.",1046649600,6,686,4.204545454545454
