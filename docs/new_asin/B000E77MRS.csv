8106889,5,B000E77MRS,"One of the things I most enjoy about the Systema approch is its logical and clear instruction method. I have learned so much about my own martial art (Okinawan karate) by studying Systema and Bujinkan material. This dvd presents the foundation of attacks involving pushes, pulls, grabs, chokes, takedowns and pins. It is very useful for both novice and advanced students and teachers, giving clear and simple drills that you can practice with your partners. What is even more cool is that the end of the dvd features a class taught by Vasiliev at his school covering much of what was discussed in the first part, giving you a sense of how to further study/teach the concepts. Buy this dvd, especially if you study aikido or jujutsu. It will give you new insights.",1156550400,,763,4.7443609022556394
8106890,5,B000E77MRS,"I have all of Mr. Vasiliev's old VHS tapes passed on to me from a friend who bought them on ebay. The content being truly excellent I went ahead and bough his DVD's as well. This one teaches you practical skills to get out of tight spots in a hurry. Most useful info which I took to my taichi and aikido classes and ""tested"" on the senior folks there. Quietly. Systema works as advertised.",1147046400,2,389,4.27027027027027
