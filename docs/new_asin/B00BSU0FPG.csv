5670271,5,B00BSU0FPG,"One of my childhood heroes all episodes in one big i mean big dvd set, the quality is great considering the age of the series and not having to watch those syndicated washed up copies that we watched as kids, great tie in with the 2013 movie coming out, storylines are simple and it's great to watch on a rainy saturday afternoon bringing back childhood memories of growing up in the 70's as a kid and watching this series at my older brothers house or sunday mornings at my parents house on WGN Chicago, if you like a half hour of simple fluff i suggest you get this set!!!! Hi Yo Silver away!!!!!",1370390400,3,598,4.300884955752212
5670272,4,B00BSU0FPG,"My Collectors' Edition set arrived a bit ago from Amazon. I've had a chance to look at some of the discs, their running times, and the other contents of  the set, and here's how it breaks down:

At first glance, the book is indeed the size of a coffee table book and won't fit on a bookshelf/media shelf.  It has a nice slipcase with a glue-tabbed label on one side advertising all of the contents (it also mentions ""Over 92 hours of Original Lone Ranger"" and 221 episodes/30 DVDs including the 2 movies).  The thing is quite heavy to boot.

The Discs Themselves:  Each season's discs are color-coded with new disc artwork, and these have new menus compared to the 75th anniversary set.  With that set, you had to wait for a portion of the intro to play before getting to the menu, and you couldn't skip it to go straight to the menu.  Here, the menu loads immediately as the intro plays in a portion of the screen.  I consider this to be a small, but pleasant, improvement.

Seasons 1 & 2:  These have the same episode counts on each disc and same run times on each discs as the 75th anniversary set (varying from 24 minutes and change up to 25 minutes and change).  Prints look the same.  Aside from the menu change, these discs seem identical to the earlier set.

Season 3:  I can't recall from syndication if these episodes still featured the Clayton Moore intro, or if they had a new intro with John Hart, but here on these discs, it's the same Clayton Moore intro as Seasons 1 and 2.  Run times vary from 22:40 to 23 minutes and change, with a stray episode here and there running around 24 minutes it seems.  These appear to be of similar video and audio quality to the Season 1 & 2 shows, but obviously shorter syndicated prints than on those seasons.  The shorter run times allow them to fit more shows on each disc compared to Seasons 1 & 2.  These were also clearly authored from videotape transfers.  9 episodes to a disc this time, 6 discs for the season (7 episodes on the last disc).

Season 4:  Same as season 3--we get episodes ranging from 22:40 to over 23 minutes and almost 24 in a few instances.  Same audio/video quality, videotape transfers.  9 episodes to a disc once again, 6 discs for the season (7 episodes on the last disc).

Season 5:  4 discs, with 10 episodes on the first 3 and 9 on the last disc. Same audio/video quality as the other seasons (except of course they are now in color, and appear to be videotape transfers).  Run times are around 22:30 each and a few run close to 23 minutes.  I compared these prints to Rhino's Season 5 set, and while those also had the same run times as these (~22:30-23:00), the Rhino episodes look better simply due to much less compression (that set had about 5 episodes to a disc, compared to the 10 on these).  The Rhino episodes also had several chapter breaks in each episode, whereas this set has no chapter breaks on any episodes.

With regards to the season 3-5 episodes, I did not detect any time compression or speed-up in the audio or the video, same as with the earlier seasons.

Bonus Disc 1:  This appears to be the same bunch of extras as the 75th anniversary set (same Lassie episode-""Peace Patrol"", same Lone Ranger animated episodes from 1966, and the same radio broadcast).  I believe the menu is even the same, so I think this is the exact same disc with new disc art.

Bonus Disc 2:  Features the 2 movies, ""The Lone Ranger"" (1956, color) and ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold"" (1958, color).  Run time on the first movie is 1:26 and the second movie is 1:21.  Prints are not remastered in any way, but generally good quality, same as the episodes themselves, perhaps slightly better due to less compression.  These also seem to be from videotape transfers.

The Collectibles:  The same contents in the sleeve pouch as the 75th anniversary set, EXCEPT no trading cards (at least not in mine).  The pages of the coffee table book hold 2 discs to a page (top and bottom right side), and the discs are easy to remove without having to pinch the edge of the page (by comparison, the James Bond 50 set discs were much harder to get out of those sleeves which were also contained in the pages of a book).  The artwork on the pages is similar to the artwork on the pages of the 75th set's collectible booklet.  HOWEVER, the 75 set's booklet had a TON of text material, which I found very informative, and this set has NONE of that text material contained in the pages of this book.  Both feature the same timeline (with the new set having an updated timeline for 2007 and 2013).  The lack of all that wonderfully written historical information giving detailed background on the history of the character and the series is SORELY MISSED in this book--I don't understand why it wasn't included here.  You do get a Life Magazine-sized episode guide to each season's shows by disc, but no other written content.

Interestingly, my 75th set had a certificate for ""Weber's Lone Ranger Safety Club"" and a number, 90240.  The same certificate and number is included in the pages of this set as well.

Overall, if you already own the 75th anniversary set and the Rhino set, you do not need to purchase this set unless you simply want the missing episodes (I'm sure some enterprising individual will probably be selling the Season 3-5 discs on ebay before too long).  The Season 3-5 shows are also heavily edited down, unlike the earlier episodes.  Additionally, the wonderfully detailed text from the book is not included, nor are the trading cards, and the prints on the Rhino set are a little nicer looking with chapter breaks, unlike these.  HOWEVER--you do get the 2 theatrical features, and I'm not sure if these are/were sold separately on DVD at some point.

I'm a huge Lone Ranger fan who never missed an episode an syndication as a kid, week after week, year after year, so having a complete run of the shows was worth the double-dip for me ($150 on Amazon currently), even though the size of this set is cumbersome.  I am disappointed that not as much TLC went into this set as went into the 75th anniversary set, but ultimately, I'm happy to have them and share them with my young 'uns!

Hopefully this info helps some of you make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase.  Hi-Yo Silver, awaaay!",1370304000,174,6298,4.490765171503957
5670273,5,B00BSU0FPG,I just received this within the last 2 hours. I can say that disc 1 has the 1st 6 episodes and a total running time of 2 hours 27 minutes and 16 seconds. The 1st show runs 25 minutes 35 seconds before the classic media logo adds about 6 more seconds. So these guys saying that these are sped up don't seem to know what they are talking about. And of course the black and white shows have the black and white opening! Disc 28 is the final regular season disc and has 9 shows and runs 3:23:30 with the 1st show at 22:30 before the Classic media banner and this last season is the only one in color I believe. Are these full length? Hope so! These 2 discs: 1 and 28 are double layer copy protected with 6.8... on each. A small comic book and large episode guide are just some of the nice extras in this set.,1370304000,12,804,4.03125
5670274,5,B00BSU0FPG,"While I would prefer the uncut versions at nomal speed, at this point I'll take what I can get. Those of us at a certain age group (you know who you are!) have this show along with a few others (such as Adventures of Superman, etc) quite simply burnt into our minds eye.

It has, quite honestly, become a small part of who we are.

Those younger than us (say less than 40 or 45) will find this boring and too 'slow' - few people die - there aren't many things exploding - just a good, fairly simple, straight forward story that crime does not pay - sorta like the Shadow radio program.

Some of the younger crowd have been taught that this kind of program (along with Superman, HGWT, etc) is actually interesting and fulfilling to watch. I know that my daughter and some of her friends watch, for example, HGWT. It largely depends upon what their parents taught them.

BUT - anyway if I can only get sped-up or truncated versions I will take them as we may NEVER get the complete original ones.

Even messed with versions will be better than no versions at all!! And yes, I'm aware we don't KNOW if we are getting the full original versions or not as of today 5/19/13.

*****UPDATE******UPDATE*****UPDATE***** 5/31/13 @ 4:41 PM EASTERN TIME
I just received a update from TVSHOWSONDVD saying they had some early DVDs sent to them for them to review. They stated the episodes ran about 23 minutes. So they're edited or sped-up some.",1368921600,,1430,4.480769230769231
5670275,3,B00BSU0FPG,"Ignore the rating, as I've yet to see this set, though I would like to purchase it.  The rating may change over time.

Being familiar with how Classic Media butchered up and ruined The Underdog Show when they did that (including replacing the music with horrible replacement muzak) I can understand why people are concerned.  The outfit releasing this are a different outfit, but that alone is no guarantee that the episodes will be full length proper episodes.

As this set isn't out yet I can't pretend to know if these are full length episodes which are not sped up.  Sped up and butchered up episodes would not impress me either.

I have seen (on the U.S. version of Amazon) the total running time listed at 5,500 minutes.  The set has all 221 episodes.  5,500 episodes divided by 221 would equal about 25 minutes per episode.

Tvshowsondvd.com mentions that the set includes 2 bonus discs with two feature films, a Lassie episode featuring The lone Ranger, a 1960's cartoon, and an original radio broadcast.

http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Lone-Ranger-DVD-Plans/18301

So the monkey wrench in all this is a question of does the total running time include the 2 movies, Lassie episode and other bonus content?  Because if that is the case then perhaps these are shortened versions after all.

As for whether the show was shot in colour or black and white, everything on tv was shot in black and white up 'till about the middle of the sixties.  Some shows began in black and white, then were shot in colour.  However, the reason some people may remember these shows as being in black and white is because colour tv was not that common until the late sixties and early seventies.

To further confuse matters, some tv stations had black and white prints of some shows even though the shows were filmed in colour.

This show is old enough that it likely would have been shot in black and white.  Sometimes tv pilots were shot in colour back then, but even that was rare.  A lot of publicity shots were taken in colour and many dvd sets show packaging in colour even though the content is black and white.

One thing I think the industry has taken note of however is that consumers hate cheesy colourized versions of their fave old tv shows.  So you don't often see much of that these days.

I have over 900 dvd sets of various tv shows and not a one of them is colourized.

If you see a colour version of the Elvis Presley movie ""Jailhouse Rock"" kicking around that was colourized as the movie was shot in black and white.  The James Dean movie Rebel Without A Cause on the other hand was shot in colour.",1368921600,2,2606,4.6152173913043475
5670276,3,B00BSU0FPG,"As a Lone Ranger fan from the very first showing in 1949, I remember The Lone Ranger very well. Anyone who has ""Enter the Lone Ranger"" on a VHS tape by Goodtimes will probably have the only version as originally shown on television. It consisted of 3 episodes, 25+ minutes in length, for a total length of 76 minutes. A couple other Goodtimes tapes have FULL length tv episodes, and I don't think, since Golden Books and Classic Media took over the rights has The Lone Ranger ever been the same. The beginnings and ends have all been altered and/or removed, and time compressed to fit the new 22 minute tv slots. Even the Western Channel episodes a few years ago were butcher shop remnants as well as the 75th Aniversary edition. As someone who loved and grew up with The Lone Ranger, (and actually met with Clayton a few times) I would prefer the original versions as many fans would like. The complete intros, and endings as they were originally filmed and at the real time of 25+ minutes. Unfortunately, I believe Classic Media or previous owners have destroyed the edited out film and we as fans, will never see it again, unless someone outside the US still has the unedited films, and good luck getting it past Classic Media.
  They have totally destroyed the American Icon originals as we know, and loved them.
So sad they were allowed to do this. That's what happens when you get a younger generation who have no idea what The Lone Ranger meant to millions, and are only interested in making it fit 22 minutes and scrap the removed footage. They ruined a potential goldmine. I give it a three for the edited versions, but a 5 for the roll model The Lone Ranger passed on to my generation. This world might be a better place, had more kids had the time to watch The Lone Ranger reruns, rather than wear out their thumbs on computer games that teach how to kill.",1368230400,67,1867,4.488235294117647
5670277,4,B00BSU0FPG,The Lone Ranger was remastered for TV. Episodes were edited (The opening and closing) and the episodes run about 22:30 instead of 25-26 minutes. They were sped up. Will this Collector's edition be remastered and each episode run in real time at 26 minutes OR are these the 1990 TV versions that also were used in the DVD release of the first 78 episodes?,1367798400,12,354,4.546875
5670278,5,B00BSU0FPG,"This is not really a review, but more of a question. I use to love the Loan Ranger and watched it as a child. However, back in the day, our set was black and white and I have not seen the show since. My question is, were the Loan Ranger TV shows produced in color or black and white? I hate when vintage TV shows and movies are ""colorized"". I would love to get this set but not if it has been recently colorized. Does anyone know the answer?

Just because Classic Media (and now Dreamworks) seem to feel that it's not worth the effort and financial commitment to seek out and restore the original versions doesn't mean that it can't be done.  Case in point: the versions of episodes of THE LIFE AND LEGEND OF WYATT EARP currently showing on the Western Channel show clear evidence of patchwork re-editing to a lot of the episodes in which two or more versions of episodes edited in different ways have been assembled in more or less complete versions.  (So far, I've observed none which had the kind of continuity jumps seen in LONE RANGER episodes I watched on the Western Channel.)  Opening credits utilizing the standard syndication-print Tombstone sign affixed to episodes in which Wyatt is marshal of Wichita and Dodge City in seasons one through four (which could have been easily replaced by the correct openings, since they are there on other episodes) are the only indications on most of them that these are not the original prints, other than the infrequent episodes where new closing credits had to be constructed.  What it shows is that the copyright holders--or the Western Channel--clearly cared about the quality of their series.  Classic Media doesn't seem to have that dedication, since I'd bet that a call for complete episodes to Lone Ranger fandom at large would probably easily provide the raw material necessary to compile a truly complete set of the original series.  Until that happens, if the editing doesn't bother you I'd say save your money at least till the price is far lower than it currently stands.",1375142400,6,1994,4.949101796407185
5670307,5,B00BSU0FPG,"I LOVE THIS SET! IT IS TRULY A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME! You need to understand that some of my earliest memories as a five-year-old are about:
1. Waiting all week for WGN-TV in Chicago to play one hour's worth, i.e., (2) Lone Ranger episodes from 8-9 a.m. every Sunday morning, before our Catholic Sunday Mass.
2. Dressing up in my treasured, official Lone Ranger costume, complete with the black mask, sky-blue shirt and pants, the white hat, a red kerchief, a pair of the 'Ranger's cowboy boots, a sturdy, leather-look holster, (with hard plastic ""silver bullets"" to fill the holster, but not the guns.)
Best yet were 2 beautifully-reproduced ""six-shooter"" cap pistols. When loaded and fired, they made a really loud bang, and, coolest of all, the green paper caps that any kid could buy in those days for your play guns from your neighborhood toy store. Those caps were filled with just a fraction of gunpowder. By no means was this dangerous, but when they went off, one could see the faintest bit of smoke, and smell the gunpowder, just as real cowboys did. I'll talk more on this in a moment, but, for now, let's return ""to those thrilling days of yesteryear"", that is, this simply awesome, fantastic boxed set.

I'm really sorry that the one-and-only Lone Ranger, (Clayton Moore), and the real Tonto, (Jay Silverheels - sorry, Johnny Depp,) aren't around to see this set, or to autograph my copy! Moreover, if you had told me as that five-year-old, I'd now own every episode of my favorite TV show, (1949-1957), including the two Lone Ranger feature films on a 30-disc set, loaded with memorabilia? WOW. I'd have fainted. The films, FYI? ""The Lone Ranger"", and its sequel, ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold"", each about 90 minutes, in full color. Fantastic fun.

The reproduction and remastering of each show is flawless, as is the cleaned-up (mono) sound. Critics say the show was often corny; as in, the good guy always wins, but so what? What the critics forget is that young boys looked up to the Lone Ranger and Tonto characters for reinforcing the moral lessons that Moms and Dads *used* to teach their kids! Virtues such as fairness and especially RESPECT. Respect for other people, for the law, and those who enforce those laws. That is, those folks who put their lives at risk daily to protect yours: the sheriffs and deputies then; the police today. Nowadays, big punks or little thugs can commit their crimes, then resist arrest and the cops are the somehow the bad guys? WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!

Sadder still? Boys and girls can't play with toy guns in this sickeningly-Politically-Correct America anymore. Growing up in the 1950s-'60s THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. It was, years ago, a safe way to pretend good-guy-bad-guy. We took turns playing each, and, aside from sports, toy guns were part and parcel in learning conflict resolution and fair play amongst young kids. I contend that if kids had been able to play with toy guns in the last couple of decades, maybe there'd be fewer adults reaching for real guns today! Beyond that? Viewers of ""The Lone Ranger"" learned that, while the show's Bad Guys always shot to kill everyone in their way, the right-minded Lone Ranger and Tonto only shot to wound the Bad Guys. Big difference!

It's GREAT that I don't have to miss this show anymore. If you're really a fan, ""The Lone Ranger"" Boxed Set is something that you'll treasure also. Buy it while you're still able!",1375056000,3,3445,4.736666666666666

I don't have a coffee table and it won't fit on the shelf with the rest of my Lone Ranger DVDs.

5670313,5,B00BSU0FPG,"In the classic days of TV comic book heroes of the '50's and '60's, just as George Reeves WAS Superman, and Adam West WAS Batman, so too Clayton Moore WAS the Lone Ranger. That time when actors came to epitomize the characters they played on TV is gone forever. Pop culture has become too transient to be able to come up with anything that will acquire the kind of longevity that a show like THE LONE RANGER still enjoys. From 1949-1957 audiences tuned in weekly as the masked rider on his white stallion and his faithful Indian companion Tonto fought for law and order in the Old West. Generations of kids came to embrace Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels as living embodiments of their TV alter egos. In 1984, after a long legal battle, Moore actually won a counter lawsuit that allowed him to wear the Lone Ranger mask in public. A case of the hero emerging triumphant if there ever was one. Nowadays, you just don't hear of that kind of affinity between actor and role.

We can relive that nostalgia in magnificent style with Classic Media's Collector's Edition of THE LONE RANGER. This massive, 30 DVD set has all 221 episodes - black and white and color - of the five season run. Picture and sound quality is pristine, which in itself is exceptional considering that THE LONE RANGER is one of the earliest TV shows in existence. Extras include the two features THE LONE RANGER (1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (1958), a 1959 LASSIE episode with an appearance by the Lone Ranger, three episodes from the 1966 animated LONE RANGER TV series, an original 1950 LONE RANGER radio broadcast, a complete episode guide, a re-printed comic book, vintage printed items, and an autographed photo of Clayton Moore with Silver. Everything comes packaged in a large, book style DVD storage case that contains a chronological history of the character, beautifully illustrated with vintage artwork and photos.

If you're a fan - and I'm assuming you are if you're reading this - then you won't let the rather steep price prevent you from picking up this outstanding collection. Just make sure you've got somewhere to store it. As for the new movie with Johnny Depp, I don't know what the heck that is, but it's NOT the Lone Ranger. You want to know what the Lone Ranger's all about, this here's the real deal, kemosabe.

Just appreciate the fact that we FINALLY have the Ranger and Tonto on dvd! We as a society are too spoiled about convenience and should be content with the blessings that we receive, and try to stop some of our complaining. I think the print quality is fine for the age of the series. Like others have said before, the set is quite large and could have been a bit smaller.

5670316,4,B00BSU0FPG,"I wanted to be able to give this 5 stars, but I just can't. I'll tell you why as I go along. There is just something about having most of something you already have that makes this set lean toward being anticlimactic. If you never bought the 75th Anniversary Seasons 1 and 2 set, or the two full length features, then for sure this will be a WOLLEPIN WOW of a 5 star set. But when you already have the 75th Anniversary, which has more paraphernalia goodies than this set, both full length features, and both 1938 and 1939 serials (NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SET) nor intended to be, the only thing worthwhile is finally having the remaining seasons of the show that took so dern dang long to finally get to DVD. As for the size of this thing, it's HUGE. This will either be placed on your coffee tables, on top of your DVD shelf (not in it), or a preferential place of prominence. Now as far as dealing with the discs themselves. They slide in and out quite easily in this set. In fact much easier than with the previous season 1 and 2 set. If you're thinking of getting those plastic round CD cases be advised that they will not fit into the slots (of this set). A couple of things I believe would have been nice bonus features. That Lone Ranger color special other reviewers have mentioned, and a documentary about the series, the actors, and rare TV appearances. Wouldn't you have just loved to have seen that golden moment when Fonzie finally met his long time idol the Lone Ranger (John Hart). I know I would have.",1371081600,6,1513,4.34982332155477
5670317,5,B00BSU0FPG,"(special thanks to the publicist for providing me with a review copy!)

Well, then. I've had exactly zero access to or contact with the Lone Ranger and his adventures. I had a mental image of something vaguely square and outdated, almost as much as using the term ""square"". I saw that a new movie was coming out with Johnny Depp playing Tonto and rolled my eyes. What could possibly be in this franchise that was at all worthwhile?

Then I got my hands on this set, and goodness. It's so much better than I expected! Yes, it's a western, a TV show, black and white, and very old, but it's still got a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it's the extreme sincerity of Clayton Moore, a man so ""into"" the role that he did his level best to live up to the Lone Ranger's code, even long after he stopped playing the character. Whatever it is that he does, he does it incredibly well. He really is compelling on screen and brings the character to life.

Now the reviewer copy that I got didn't come with the book or anything else, but I will say that the episodes themselves look great! I don't know if they've been edited or remastered or anything, but they look and sound probably better than they did when they were broadcast back, way back, in the day. You get 30 DVDs at a reasonable price, and that's pretty mice, too. This is also something that I'd feel quite comfortable leaving even younger kids in front of. They'll enjoy the heck out of it.

Really, I can't recommend this set highly enough. It's well made, vastly entertaining and very much worth your money.",1370649600,10,1590,4.416382252559727
5670318,4,B00BSU0FPG,"Let me start by saying that I'm glad Classic Media decided to release the entire Lone Ranger series. It's great to see many episodes I've never seen before - particularly season three (with John Hart in the Lone Ranger role) and season five (in colour). However, I think there is a real problem with this set and that's the timing.

Classic Media is releasing this set to tie in with the new Lone Ranger movie. As a result, it's pretty clear they've rushed this set out to meet that deadline without giving it the careful thought they gave their earlier 75th Anniversary Lone Ranger set.

One of the giveaways is Classic Media has used the same artwork and designs from the 75th set. They've also reprinted the same memorabilia items and bonus materials disc and added the Lone Ranger features disc they had released recently. That would allow them to speed up the set's production rather than coming up with new material.

That ""need for speed"" has hurt the set in certain ways. There's little or no info on the show and characters themselves as there was in the early set. Yes, they do include a guide to the episodes. However, this is a separate booklet. The slipcase itself is full of random Lone Ranger art without any listings or markings to indicate which discs are in which sleeves. That makes it a little problematic trying to find the episode you want. The new DVD menus also don't match the disc colours (i.e. blue discs have the red DVD menu, the black discs have the yellow menu, etc.)

The prints are in very good shape (generally B+) but they haven't gone back to the masters here. Classic Media has stuck with the syndicated edits which are truncated slightly as they were in the 75th set (one of that set's only real drawbacks). Instead of the original openings here, the first four seasons use a decolorized opening taken from the final colour season. (You can tell because they have the same print damage as the fifth season colour opening.) The colour episodes themselves are quite good given their age with the exception of the odd minor print dirt or scuffing.

In Classic Media's defense, it's possible the original prints needed a lot of restoration work to re-instate all the full intros and outros - and they didn't have the time or budget for the set to do so. In order to incorporate the complete prints, the set would've definitely needed to be larger in size to incorporate additional discs. Classic Media also went through an ownership change recently - and is now under the DreamWorks umbrella. Perhaps that move had an affect on the product here.

Actually, it's too bad they didn't continue to release the remaining three seasons years ago after they'd released seasons one and two with the 75th Anniversary set. (Again, they were likely waiting on the prospect of a new Lone Ranger movie in order to boost sales.) The more I look at the first 75th set, it was incredibly compact and overflowed with nice Lone Ranger touches. With John Hart taking over the Lone Ranger role in the third season, it's possible Classic Media were worried sales would drop off substantially with a John Hart Lone Ranger set. (To be honest, John Hart doesn't do a bad job here. He just seems to lack some of the intensity Clayton Moore brought to the role.)

In terms of the set's construction, I was initially concerned about the DVD cardboard sleeve idea but had nothing to worry about. This oversized limited edition slipcase set is very hefty - it's a beast! - making it very well-protected. The actual DVDs are in huge pages with large smooth sleeves that protect the DVDs and make them easy to retrieve.

All in all, I'm glad I bought the set and finally have all the episodes - particularly the colour ones - after years of waiting. When it comes right down to it, the only real unfortunate drawbacks are the lack of full prints and some improved info and DVD identification that would've make this set a real winner.

Classic Media hasn't put out a definitive set here. But they have done a decent job given the project's apparent limitations and the fact that a collection like this has never been attempted before. I would've liked to see some finer details like I did with the handy and ultimately more thoughtful 75th set. But this one still gets the job done. And it might be the only complete set we have to look forward to regardless.",1370649600,53,4362,4.625322997416021
5670319,5,B00BSU0FPG,so glad that I bought this.  it is just amazing.  There will never be another Lone Ranger & Tonto.  Lots of memories for me.  Very special Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels were.

5670320,5,B00BSU0FPG,"The release of the Collector's Edition of THE LONE RANGER series  - a full-fledged 28 CD set with 221 episodes of the inordinately popular and now hallowed black and white television series that was aired originally from 1949 to 1957 - is more of a significant event than many are acknowledging. The quality of the episodes on CD format is excellent - very crisp and well transferred - and the included bonuses are exceptional. It is an investment well worth the price, but it is also an important event in re-examining the history of America's choices of the fifties, the notable music that was included in a family show, and a reflection of the changes that have occurred in our mores since that time.

Music first: the widely associated Lone Ranger Theme is Rossini's William Tell Overture, but in addition to that borrowing from classical music, the show also used the following classical music classy themes - Les Preludes by Franz Lizst,  Euryanthe  by Karl Maria von Weber, Bizet's Symphony in C, Mendelssohn's Fingal's Cave Overture, Emil von eznek's Donna Diana Overture, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Die Moldau by Bedrich Smetana and music by Schubert. Yes, that was before the restrictions of recordings applied, but the works were all in public domain and were conducted by Daniel Prez Castaeda.

Some will watch an note the disparity between the Lone Ranger (Clayton Moore) and his companion Tonto (Jay Silverheels): though the two were bonded, Tonto's dialogue was in an embarrassing pigeon English (""Ke-mo sah-bee"") that likely would not be tolerated today after the civil rights movements. But lest we forget the essential warmth of this series it is wise to remember the following:

The Lone Ranger is a fictional character, a masked ex-Texas Ranger who, with his Indian companion Tonto, fights injustice in the American Old West. The character has become an enduring icon of American culture. Both characters took their positions as role models to children very seriously and tried their best to live by this creed. `I believe...that to have a friend, a man must be one, that all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world, that God put the firewood there, but that every man must gather and light it himself, in being prepared physically, mentally, and morally to fight when necessary for that which is right, that a man should make the most of what equipment he has, that 'this government of the people, by the people, and for the people' shall live always, that men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number, that sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the world and make payment for what we have taken, that all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever, and I believe in my Creator, my country, my fellow man.' Strong thoughts that likely unwittingly molded our perceptions for the better - for a while.

Fran Striker and George W. Trendle, who `invented' The Lone Ranger used the following definitions for their characters (courtesy of Wikipedia):
The Lone Ranger is never seen without his mask or a disguise.
With emphasis on logic, The Lone Ranger is never captured or held for any length of time by lawmen, avoiding his being unmasked.
The Lone Ranger always uses perfect grammar and precise speech completely devoid of slang and colloquial phrases, at all times.
When he has to use guns, The Lone Ranger never shoots to kill, but rather only to disarm his opponent as painlessly as possible.
Logically, too, The Lone Ranger never wins against hopeless odds; i.e., he is never seen escaping from a barrage of bullets merely by riding into the horizon.
Even though The Lone Ranger offers his aid to individuals or small groups, the ultimate objective of his story never fails to imply that their benefit is only a by-product of a greater achievement--the development of the west or our country. His adversaries are usually groups whose power is such that large areas are at stake.
Adversaries are never other than American to avoid criticism from minority groups. There were exceptions to this rule. He sometimes battled foreign agents, though their nation of origin was generally not named. One exception was helping the Mexican Juarez against French troops of Emperor Maximilian, as occurred in radio episodes such as ""Supplies for Juarez"" (18 September 1939), ""Hunted by Legionnaires"" (20 September 1939) and ""Lafitte's Reinforcements"" (22 September 1939).
Names of unsympathetic characters are carefully chosen, never consisting of two names if it can be avoided, to avoid even further vicarious association--more often than not, a single nickname is selected.
The Lone Ranger never drinks or smokes, and saloon scenes are usually interpreted as cafes, with waiters and food instead of bartenders and liquor.
Criminals are never shown in enviable positions of wealth or power, and they never appear as successful or glamorous.

So this Collector's Collection has much more to offer than excellent transfers of a fine series.  It is a bit of Americana that deserves our attention. Grady Harp, June 13
