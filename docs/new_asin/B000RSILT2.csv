8202458,5,B000RSILT2,"""Seven Days Ashore"" is about the best comedy made about our Merchant Marine. When other great movies were being made about the USMM during the war like ""Action in the North Atlantic"" which was an excellent movie, this movie shows the Merchant Marine on a lighter note having fun while on shore leave for seven days. This movie was made like a musical and the Freddiie Slack band is second to none. Some big name stars also appeare in this film like Virginia Mayo! To bad this can't be purchased on a DVD yet as it is 10 times better then a lot of the junk they are making today!
