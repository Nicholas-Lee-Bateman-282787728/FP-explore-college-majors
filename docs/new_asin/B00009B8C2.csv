7990568,4,B00009B8C2,"Watchusdorm.com is a voyeur website where paying members can follow a group of co-eds 24-7.  The girls are hired for the job and know they're expected to put on a show, taking several showers a day and dancing for the camera.

The site is doing well but when one girl dies in an accident (or was it an 'accident') the hits go through the roof.  Soon another dies suspiciously and finally the girls are locked in the house and picked off one by one while millions watch, and the website is hacked and now says watchusdie.com.

It's a great twist on an old formula.  For once the girls are written realistically, they know they're on display for horny guys and they don't mind as long as they're getting paid.  The plot has some holes, and never explains why no one has a cell phone, but isn't bad.  Most of the girls can act, and the ones who can't at least are easy on the eyes.

Sometimes the low budget shows through.  The camera cuts to various fans watching on their computers, but I soon noticed the fans never changed clothes even over several days.  Oh well.

For what it is Watch Us Die is a pretty decent slasher film, nothing more, but really who expects more.",1329782400,,1170,4.37037037037037
7990569,1,B00009B8C2,"I do not know why I rented this movie. Maybe because it was my gut instinct or some shtick like that. One of the worse movies ever made. Oh, it's down there. No one can act in this stupifying movie. I got stupifyed. Look, people who love these kinds of damn music should check themselves at the front door. The woman in that house create someof the worst lines ever spewed and so do the beefcake men. I would wanna watch every copy of this movie get burned in a bonfire. Talking about the music was great, the music sucked, They needed some heavy hardcore rock music or something. The music in this was cheesier then hell. Did they have to put grandma in this? I thought her pacemaker was gonna fail or something, because grandma deserves better. Steer clear from this pile of toxic waste.",1092700800,,789,4.410958904109589
7990570,4,B00009B8C2,"I was suprised by how good this movie was.  Of course its far from high art, butit is even farther from the B movie soft core porn it looks like.  Honestly, yes, there is a lot of cheesecake, mainly with the girls in their underwear, or a swim suit, or something of that nature, but actualy nudity?  There is VERY little actual nudity.  Acting wise, well, to say I was suprise is an understatement.  Yes, there are those moments of bad dialogue and all that, but over all the cast did fairly well.  Also the production values seem fairly high on this one.  The picture is decent,and seems to be filmed, not taped.  And the music is very good.  Also the thriller part of the movie comes off very well due to the fact that the characters, although far from deep, are mostly likeable.  I recomend it.",1061683200,6,797,4.360544217687075
7990571,3,B00009B8C2,"""Watchusdie.com"" is a low budget entry into the recently popular voyeur films like ""Feardotcom"". This is the story of a group of women living in a webcammed filled home. Everything is fine until the women start losing their lives in various accidents. As ""hits"" on the web site grow, so do the deaths of the inhabitants. The film is more of a thriller than horror as the main interest is figuring out who is doing all the killing. An interesting sub plot shows audience reaction to what is occurring on the web site and is a slight commentary on our current fascination with reality tv and the like. The acting is what can be expected from former playmates and others hired more for their looks than talent. The primary interest is a director's commentary track which illustrates quite well the trials and tribulations of low budget, renegade filmmaking. This makes the film worthwhile and on a whole, you could do a lot worse.",1061424000,,927,4.693251533742331
