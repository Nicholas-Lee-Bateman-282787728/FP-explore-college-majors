8557159,4,B00ARWXD9G,"The ""plot"" wanders, slows down & loses its connection to the story line. ""The"" Hidden Beauties"" moves this from a two star to a four star.",1485993600,,138,4.346153846153846

8557163,3,B00ARWXD9G,"Given a neutral 3 stars because I haven't seen it: was just surprised that there's not even a plot synopsis or cast of players in the [at this time, nonexistent] product description! So, courtesy of Rotten Tomatoes, the following:
""Three beautiful young women are tricked and seduced by Lord Isherwood. When their plan for revenge accidentally kills him, the Lord's Gypsy protector Natasha places a curse on the three, putting them into a hundred-year sleep. 100 years later, the three are awakened when the American descendants of Lord Isherwood come to visit the family estate. The young ladies want nothing more than to get on with their lives and make up for lost time, but Natasha is not yet ready to let them leave. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>""",1458950400,4,772,4.992248062015504
