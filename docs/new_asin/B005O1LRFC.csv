8480896,5,B005O1LRFC,"Nico Archambault is the Qubcois male dancer and choreographer (b. 1984 in Montral) who soared from well-schooled professionalism (but obscurity so far as the greater public for entertainment was concerned) to the heights of popular fame and glory when he won first place in the initial season of ""So You Think You Can Dance Canada"". He enraptured the public at that widely televised event and his renown was instantly assured. The man's sheer beauty and charisma equal his terrific talent as a dancer in many idioms. In the role of Marc Plainchaud (which would be French for ""Fully Hot"" except for one spelling difference which, anyway, would not affect pronunciation!) in the 2011 dance film, ""Sur le rythme"" (the English title of which is ""The Rhythm in Me""). In this movie, he appears at his best, moustached and lightly bearded, with thick, wavy auburn hair that, together with his pastel-blue eyes, give him a full yet firm, sensuous face that commands attention, allied with an impressively well-developed body and beautiful complexion. Visually, he is a delight to behold, so it may seem rather a shame to many of his admirers that Nico does not shed more frequently the various shirts in which his muscled torso is garbed so much of the time!

""Sur le rythme"" (Seville/Entertainment One 210786-DV being the DVD edition viewed, rather than the Blu-ray alternative, including English subtitles) is, essentially and unsurprisingly, a cinematic show-case for Nico Archambault, but the movie also displays some of the best examples of dancing to be seen in Montral, or, for that matter, in Canada, from ""modern dance"" and breakdance, to commercial show dancing, and much in between. It would be nice if there had been an occasional slow number, but there is plenty of variety to the up-tempo, lively fare that prevails. While there is the usual quotient of ""squirm and churn"" in the choreography, most of it is bracingly vigourous, quite athletic, and even awesomely acrobatic. Some discothque dancing scenes occur, as well, including a music video that is among the DVD's bonus features, and few people need to be informed that French-Canadians out-boogie any other white folks (straight or gay) anywhere else on the North American continent. The dancers assembled throughout the film are among the best available in Qubec and more widely within the Dominion of Canada.

Although Nico Archambault is the leading star of the film, the story, on which so much fine dancing is pegged, revolves around the leading female in the cast, Mylne Saint-Sauveur (as Delphine), whose plight is the frequently told story of going into an artistic profession (dance, of course, in this movie) over the objections of her parents, who press her to continue her medical studies. The story is hardly original, but the drama that plays itself out between the dance scenes is one that is strong on credibility and gratefully free. for the most part, of the kinds of soppy sentiment and clichs that abound in so many other motion pictures with this common variety plot.

Saint-Sauveur dances well enough to make her a believable enough partner for Nico Archambault, surely, in itself, no mean achievement. France Castel, as Delphine's supportive grandmother, had been an highly successful singing star in French pop music (of the middle-of-the-road kind) in earlier decades, and her turn here as an actress is very accomplished, making her character a very appealing old lady. This film is first class from top to bottom, especially in all matters related to dance, but in other cinematic aspects as well. Highly recommended!",1422057600,,3607,5.079258010118044
