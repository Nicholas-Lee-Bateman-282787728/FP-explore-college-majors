7977127,3,B00007JO6T,"PROS:
Good warm up exercises.
Useful drills.
Some ""staged"" demonstrations included.

CONS
Very low budget format (e.g. looks like it was filmed in somebody's converted garage/gym, with a bunch of ""bums"" with beer guts, wearing ""wife beater"" T-shirts, and sloppily ""performing"" the drills/techniques as if they only ""train"" on days when they aren't drunk at the bar.). Yes, Really!

The DVD cover lists things ""YOU WILL LEARN"" but, half the stuff listed there is either just momentarily brushed over/mentioned in passing, or not even shown/included in the video (e.g. take down techniques) at all!

Some ""subtle"" mistakes are made which will especially confuse viewers who are beginners to such material.

No section on direct street self defense applications at all.

No discussion of basic equipment whether used in the video or not.",1497225600,,834,5.287878787878788
7977128,3,B00007JO6T,I come from a Savate background with French instructors and French champions. This is not one of my top videos on Savate but there is very little out on Savate so it's worth adding to your library.,1343347200,,197,4.351351351351352
7977129,4,B00007JO6T,"I enjoyed this dvd as an intro to the sport. the beginning is a little tough to navigate and long, though. there is a good warm up at the beginning and he goes right into techniques.
He hurries through the techniques a little, so you can't practice with them while you are watching, but you can pause it an do them or what i do is write down what they are doing and practice at my leisure.
I like the techniques, they are different than most other styles of kickboxing and are fun to do. i do them solo and feel like i have learned a lot. again, as an intro, i think it is good.",1212624000,,578,3.9913793103448274
7977130,3,B00007JO6T,"This is a good instructional dvd, packed with exercises, drills, and techniques, both traditional and modern.  It's not professional, but that certainly doesn't hurt its value.  The only complaint I have, is that the last half is horrible to unwatchable due to scrambled picture.  That's probably just a problem with my personal copy of the dvd though.",1121904000,5,352,5.140350877192983
