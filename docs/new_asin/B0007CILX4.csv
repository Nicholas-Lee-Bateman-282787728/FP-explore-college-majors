2208287,5,B0007CILX4,"This is Nanci from nearly twenty years ago, and she sings and looks GREAT (she still does!).  As for the on-again, off-again red scarf mystery mentioned by an earlier reviewer, this was obviously caused by the fact that the videos were edited from more than one concert performance. The selection of songs in the concert segment of this DVD is also slightly different from those on the ""One Fair Evening"" CD--again obviously due to the fact that more than one version of the concert was recorded.  In any event, disappearing red scarf or not, this DVD is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the bonus videos are a great plus!  The only ""downside"" to this DVD, if any, is that it is not LONG enough!  I LOVE Nanci!",1125100800,5,701,4.584
2208288,5,B0007CILX4,I bought this Nanci Griffith when it first came out on vhs so many years ago.and catches nanci at her best.(accustic)so i was pleased to find it on dvd with extra tracks it was worth the price for the track with nanci/crickets doing a Buddy Holly song,1122940800,,251,4.361702127659575
2208289,5,B0007CILX4,"I picked up this DVD as whim, given I've always admired Nanci Griffith and own a couple of her CD.  Sure, I always knew she had a wonderful, angelic, country folk voice (in the time honored tradition of Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss), but to see/watch her perform, stripped of any gimmicks, is really a treat.  Despite being much lower profile, she could hold her own as a folk songstress with the great one ala Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell.  What's most amazing with this 27-year old DVD is that the sound reproduction is truly unbelievable.  (Word of caution:  though you have the DTS surround sound option, the mix is awful.  However, when played on the Dolby 5.1 audio option, the home theatre audio is rich, full and fabulous.  I enjoyed this DVD so much I'm going to run out and purchase her Winter Marqee in the very near future.  Even casual fans such as myself cannot go wrong here.",1120262400,3,893,4.5375
2208290,5,B0007CILX4,"I first found Nanci in a small CD shop known for having the best of the best (not just the popular). The CD was on the ""highly recommended"" rack and I bought it on faith. Since then have bought every one of her albums I could lay my hands on. This DVD is however the first time I've ever seen Nanci perform. The concert video may be noisy (no better than a less-than-average VHS tape), but it doesn't matter. This is a great concert and Nanci's enjoyment of her music comes through clearly. She's having fun. Most important, the sound quality is great. Note that the track list isn't the same as the CD. The bonus videos are of course excellent quality and they round-off the DVD nicely.",1116028800,3,687,4.375
2208291,4,B0007CILX4,"Some 15 years ago I found myself flipping through the channels late one Friday night.  And the second-and-a-half that I let A&E or PBS or whatever channel it was put Nanci Griffith on my TV's flickering screen was all it took.  My thumb stopped flipping, my ears opened, and my heart was touched.

Forget the fact that in the first eight bars of music presented here Ms. Griffith hits you with more emotion and nuance than most performers generate in a career, and that she effortlessly goes from caressing sotto voce to full-throttle in those few seconds.  This is above all -genuine- music.  A singer.  A song.  An audience.  A venue.  All magically joined with the stars aligned and your deity of choice blessing the proceedings.  And you understand how you (me), someone who's never been a huge fan of country or folk (despite owning 1,500 CDs) can suddenly be swept away by the sound of a simple six-string and a simpler (but is it really?) voice.

From that accidental encounter on late-night TV, I've acquired this performance on CD (with a slightly different track list), laserdisc, and now DVD.  Tragically the DVD video transfer is little improved from the LD: grainy and full of noise.  Hence the 4-star rating.

As a musician, I've resisted the urge to view this document as a talisman, as such intimacy and connection with an audience cannot be attained through study or effort or intent.  But as a man, 'tis an accurate bellwether: play it for your paramour, and if she doesn't ""get it"", kiss her gently on the cheek and hand, and send her on her merry way.  If she does ""get it"", enjoy cooking her breakfast ;-).",1114473600,4,1627,4.656140350877193
2208292,5,B0007CILX4,"Forget the grainy video quality, this is a must-have for any of Nanci's fans.  I have loved the original CD since it became my introduction to Nanci Griffith many years ago.  This concert pre-dates most of her more successful releases (Storms, Flyer, Other Rooms), but I am in awe of the budding talent in evidence on this DVD.  Her charm and wit flow freely on gems like Love at the Five and Dime and Once in a Very Blue Moon.  The inclusion of There's A Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret) is a delightful addition not present on the original CD.  Also welcome are the videos of five songs which I had never had the opportunity to previously enjoy.

If you are a new fan, or a long-time friend...you will not be able to resist a smile and will be glad you parted with the few dollars to own this delightful release.  I know that I will enjoy it over and over for many years to come.",1108339200,8,889,4.287425149700598
2208293,5,B0007CILX4,"In some shots, she has a scarf wrapped around the belt of her dress. On others shots, it's not there! Now you see it, now you don't - sometimes in the same song, it's there one second and not the next. Should we put it down to poor continuity? What the heck - I don't mind....

What I do mind is the fact that this is such a warm and wonderful little gem of a DVD. I've always liked the album - all the songs are fabulous, but to see her perform them as on the CD is very special. This seems to be an intimate little concert, with only James Hooker seen accompanying Nanci on keyboards. However, I'm certain there is at least one more guitarist playing in the background somewhere.

Whatever! It's a little masterpiece and Nanci has this really comfortable rapport with the audience, which adds to the intimacy. At the end of the set, with the credits going up, there's a nifty little treat when she sings the ""Wichita Falls Waltz"" - a short and humorous piece which I had not heard before and is not on the original album.

The videos are a joy - I love all five tracks, but ""I Knew Love"", ""I Don't Want To Talk About Love"" and ""Late Night Grande Hotel"", (in which she looks stunning and different - it's the eye make-up and the fringe) are fantastic. The songs are breathtaking, but the videos enhance them.

Go and buy this - it is a wonderful gem. I wonder if there are any more of these DVDs just waiting to be unleashed on the unsuspecting public. Let's hope so.",1108339200,20,1468,4.250896057347671
2208294,4,B0007CILX4,"Like most Nanci Griffith fans who have either the CD version or the hard to find VHS version (or both) of this fine concert at Anderson Fair, it was a no-brainer to pick up this little jewel as soon as it was released on DVD. My only complaint is the poor digitizing of the video.  The venue itself had low lighting and thus the picture was very grainy on the original VHS.  I thought they could have done more to soften up the picture with today's technology, but it's clear that they either could not or would not.  Regardless, this is a top notch Nanci performance.  During the song ""Love at the five and dime"" and on a couple other songs, observant fans will notice Eric Taylor (Nanci's one-time husband) doing backing vocals (on the screen to the right of James Hooker).  The bonus videos make this DVD even more of a must have.  Nanci never looked lovelier!

I am eagerly awaiting the release of the Other Voices concert on DVD.  That one was hands-down the best Nanci concert ever released!!",1108166400,2,998,4.475138121546961
2208295,4,B0007CILX4,"This is a great performance of Nanci at her finest.  The sound has been cleaned up remarkably from the VHS edition (especially good is the DTS), but unfortunately the picture has not (that's why only four stars).  MCA obviously put very little money into the project in the first place because it looks as if it were recorded on someone's home video camera -- it does look better than it did but there was just so much they could do.  One thing has always puzzled me about this, however; for some reason the performance of ""Wing and the Wheel"" that is one the CD edition of this concert has been left out of both the VHS and DVD editions.  The addition of the videos is a very welcome bonus. I had never seen most of them as no music channel has the good sense to play Nanci Griffith.",1107993600,6,784,4.277027027027027
2208296,4,B0007CILX4,"Nanci Griffith is so talented, and an awesome storyteller.  This video, while dated, is a Must Have for fans and lovers of good music.",1317254400,,134,4.583333333333333
2208297,3,B0007CILX4,"I was interested in this DVD for the fabulous Roseville Fair, which, sadly, along with The Wing and the Wheel (another of Ms. Griffith's great ones!), is not included.  Great music, and the bonus videos would be nice, if only the DVD had included songs from the actual performance listeners hear on the CD!  I was willing to forgive the poor video quality other reviewers noted given the venue, but passed when I realized I wouldn't experience Ms. Griffith's performance of the song for which I was buying the DVD.",1276732800,,514,4.7
2208298,4,B0007CILX4,"I love this concert!  This is a younger, more conventional, less political Nanci.  The 1988 concert will take you back a few years.

The sound is the same as the CD, but the video looks like a grainy home movie.  To me, this doesn't detract from the intimacy of the concert setting or my enjoyment of her performance any more than if it was a home movie.

So if you want cinematic perfection, look elsewhere.  If you like Nanci and want to experience a fantastic concert, this is it.",1268870400,,483,4.370786516853933
2208299,5,B0007CILX4,"This DVD is Nanci in her finest hour. I cannot recommend it highly enough. My only complaint is that it does not have the same line up of songs as the CD. Other than that, This DVD and the CD of the same title are an absolute MUST for anyone that is the least bit interested in Nanci, folk, folk rock, country, etc... Nanci, You're the BEST...thanks!

This DVD is high quality sound, but, picture quality, while it's somewhat lacking, is still WONDERFUL. I get the feeling that they didn't intend to release this as a DVD/Video and that someone filmed it for posterity and this release was an afterthought due to the success of the CD. HOWEVER, I found, after I got the DVD and viewed it that I don't know how I ever lived with out it! It is an ABSOLUTE JOY to see and hear her at the same time and it's quirky quality actually add to the feel of being there!

The slickly produced videos of alternate tracks that round out the performance quite nicely, is a nice addition. I highly recommend it. Nanci LIVE is a DELIGHT!

My favorite on here is her version of ""Love at the Five & Dime"". Frankly, the entire recording is worth it just for this song alone as this version is her best! There is not a bad track/performance on here!",1246579200,,1229,4.288793103448276
2208300,2,B0007CILX4,"The songs are excellent, but the video quality is brutal to watch.
I consider it a DVD audio.
The videos included with the performance are a nice addition.",1226966400,,155,4.571428571428571
2208301,3,B0007CILX4,"I know this was not a major production when it was originally filmed, but I have to say that this is probably the worst looking DVD I have ever seen.  Surely with the technology available today there could be a better master of this fantastic performance.  The audio is great, which of course is the main reason for getting it.  Nanci Griffith is one of my favorite singer/song writers, and I would still suggest this DVD even with the lackluster video quality.",1204588800,,461,4.597560975609756
2208302,3,B0007CILX4,"Given all the hype, I was not that impressed. Mediocre recording quality and 57 minutes doesn't cut it with me.  I'll take Patti Griffith anytime",1182988800,,145,4.8
2208303,5,B0007CILX4,"I am a huge Nanci fan and saw One Fair Summer Evening on PBS prior to ordering. She is a very talented singer, songwriter and musician! She tells such beautiful stories in song. This DVD is great for viewing with friends or that special someone. Amazing show...2 back up singers, an acoustic guitar and a piano. All I have to say is WOW!

Because she is still somewhat of an unknown is a mystery to me. This DVD would make a wonderful gift for anyone that likes the styles of Emmylou Harris, Janis Ian.",1174608000,,502,4.340425531914893
2208304,4,B0007CILX4,A good video shot live at Anderson Fair in Houston.  It's a bit older but still quite nice.  Video is a bit grainey from the low light setting but the audio is good.,1170547200,,165,3.9696969696969697
2208305,5,B0007CILX4,"I've seen Nanci in different settings, but the simple setting on this DVD is perfect. One keyboard, a couple of vocalist, with Nanci and her guitar.

It doesn't get much purer or soothing than this. I wish she could do a tour with this same set up. I know what she's doing with the NPR is a great cause but you really miss the intimicy that you get on One Fair Summer Evening DVD. A must for any listener's collection!!",1168300800,,419,4.2375
8046686,5,B0007CILX4,My husband and I really love this collection of Nanci's great songs. It's fun to watch her sing the songs we have listened to on CD's.,1517097600,,134,4.1923076923076925
8046687,3,B0007CILX4,"This is a better dvd then the other one I reviewed.  She does her songs Once In A Blue Moon,Love At The Five And Dime,Lookin' For The Time.  Which I think are the kind of songs she does best.  I also think she does the best version of From A Distant,  Being from Wichita Falls I was curious about the song Wichita Falls Waltz.  Which it turns out really didn't add anything to the concert.  But over all it's still a pretty good live dvd.",1506384000,,438,4.094117647058823
8046688,5,B0007CILX4,my favorite . . . love her,1504483200,,26,2.857142857142857
8046689,1,B0007CILX4,My husband buys her music.  I think she sounds like Minny Mouse or Dolly Parton on helium.,1491436800,,90,4.294117647058823
8046690,5,B0007CILX4,Great DVD. I love it.,1490486400,,21,3.4
8046691,4,B0007CILX4,Great performance from Nanci.  I would have liked to see more backup musicians.  One guy on an electric piano doesn't do these songs full justice.  Her Austin City Limits band would have done the trick.,1470355200,,202,4.714285714285714
8046692,5,B0007CILX4,Nanci Griffith is the best!  I love her music and this concert was great.,1408924800,,73,4.214285714285714
8046693,5,B0007CILX4,"This is a great DVD. I have fun watching her grow in her music; from Anderson Fair to her music videos. In my opinion, she is the great of female folk songs.",1404518400,,157,3.9375
8046694,5,B0007CILX4,"I am kicking myself for not buying this the minute I realized that it was finally available, but I had been put off by talk of poor quality video and sound. Maybe I was lucky, but my copy is excellent. No, it ain't ultra crisp HD, but this is absolutely fine and a rare treasure for the serious Nanci fan to watch over and over again. The bonus videos are also a delight.

Having played the CD album so many times, it is a joy to be able to watch the actual performance from that Fair Summer's Evening in Houston's famous Anderson's Fair.

The only unfortunate thing is that not all of the album tracks are on here, including the stunning Trouble In The Fields and Roseville Fair, but conversly we are treated to the very beautiful There's A Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret), which wasn't on the CD.

Don't hesitate, folks, this is a rare gem.",1394928000,,851,4.3734177215189876
8046695,5,B0007CILX4,It was a gift and the recipient loved it.  I didn't listen to it so I can't add anything else.,1356912000,,94,3.7
