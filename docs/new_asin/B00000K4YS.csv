Then they dicover that some of there shipmates have killed eachother while they were on there shift,it turns out that they picked up a  alian device that turns humans homicidal.  The ending will make you cry.",953596800,5,300,4.518518518518518
7914284,5,B00000K4YS,"This is a very good sci-fi movie. Several reviews claimed there are actually no alien onboard the vessel. My comment to them is to watch the movie all over again, obviously they didn't understand the movie. By the way It doesn't has to be some kind of monster to be an alien. The acting is superb and the whole concept of this movie is refreshing and original. Very sorry there is no a DVD version of this movie yet. I do have the VHS video and I watch it every now and then getting new interesting details every time. I highly recommend this movie",1485820800,,548,4.278846153846154
7914285,4,B00000K4YS,"You can find this streamed, so no need to buy a VHS tape player.  Its actually very good considering it was done in late 90's with a tiny budget and little if any CG.  It has xlnt story, scripting, acting, sets and in my top 10% of scifi's (since most of them are so totally stupid).  Don't expect aliens or space battles though.",1477180800,,329,4.190476190476191
7914286,2,B00000K4YS,"So where are the aliens?  Yes I agree, rent do not buy.  Wait aminute Do not rent either, just watch on you tube.  First When the ship is ALMOST out of fuel, they COULD have done a 15 second burn to set the ship on a course for home.  Dummies, IN SPACE you DO NOT have to burn rockets continually.  Since there is NO atmosphere, the ship WILL maintain a trajectory with NO POWER needed.  Need an example?  In the film the chambers were moved from ship to ship WITHOUT the use of rocket power.  Just an initial nudge did it. Second, why is it a two dimensional system.  Where is the Z Axis people?  Gee I can go left or right but not up or down.  IN SPACE?  Really?  Third, Why did the computer wake the second set up far too late with ""no options left?  IF computers are so darn smart, what happened to Shoshone?  A HAL 9000 she ain't.  OK I could go on but you get it by now.  On the plus side the girl WAS sorta Smokin Hot, but the acting in this flik was too scripted and unnatural.  Even the end, the ship COULD have been towed by the dolphin smaller research vehicle, to a meet up destination with another ship to transfer some fuel.  OH I FORGOT, they were ""off the elliptical"".  LOL.  Way too many screw ups here.  Where was the technical advisor in all this.  MAybe I could get a job to rewrite this movie.  At least I WOULD keep the girl.  BUT I guarantee you would like my version lots better...........",1441756800,,1413,4.125461254612546
7914287,5,B00000K4YS,"Alien Cargo is underrated.  To sum up this movie I would use something like, ""this movie is short and sweet and leaves you thinking"".  I love Jason London's and Missey Crider's acting in this.  You owe it to yourself to check this movie out, although it is a shame it's only on VHS.  I love how to the point this movie seems to be--I see it as being well balanced with every scene tying into the next.",1356739200,2,401,4.1688311688311686
7914288,5,B00000K4YS,"despite negative reviews, i found this film rewarding. good friends and lovers turned against each other because of alien contamination. outside force is used against them, proving the weakest link in humanitys strength. this movie conveys our weakness in our circumstance. a refreshing look at our utter weakness towards self survival. it's always self that must survive. it's always me. i will survive. this movie is crystal clear. we must survive, at all costs. even though our loved ones perish. how sad.",1336608000,3,508,5.2073170731707314
7914289,4,B00000K4YS,"One of my favorites, a bit slow, but a good movie.  Lots of suspence.",1198540800,3,69,3.9285714285714284
7914290,2,B00000K4YS,"Twenty years after ALIEN, they're still recycling the formula.  But as demonstrated by ALIEN CARGO, the forumla has lost a lot of steam over the decades.

As with ALIEN, ALIEN CARGO features what are supposed to be gritty, jaded, cynical astronauts hauling cargo for a sleazy mining company.

But ALIEN CARGO's astronauts lack the necessary grit.  There are ten of them, but two die early, and six spend most of the film in hybernation.  The two remaining astronauts look barely 20 years old.  I know this was meant to create ""youth appeal"" for the market, but I just didn't buy that these were real astronauts.  They were more like whiny coeds.

(Yes, I know the film offers a rationale; these astronauts are older than they look, since they spend much time in hybernation, but they still lack the requisite maturity or gravitas.)

ALIEN CARGO is really low budget, and it shows.  I assume this is a direct-to-video movie.  Just two actors with any real screen time.  The rescue ship also has only two astronauts, spouting really bad dialogue.  One's obviously a villain, the other obviously compassionate; really lame good cop/bad cop stuff, resulting in some phony-sounding ""conflict.""

Worse, ALIEN CARGO has no alien.  Apparently, some space germ has infiltrated the ship, causing the astronauts to go crazy and kill each other.  But since most of the screen time is just the two young astronauts, and they're too cute to kill off (they're in love!), nothing much happens.  They chase each other around, and wield shivs, and smash equipment, but nothing more dramatic than that.  (At least not until the end, but by then I didn't care; I was only glad the film was over.)

So really, with no alien, ALIEN CARGO is more of a ""killer astronaut"" film, an offshot of ALIEN's killer alien subgenre.

Even so, I've seen made-for-cable ""killer astronaut"" movies with more suspense than ALIEN CARGO.  For instance, TRAPPED IN SPACE, starring Kay Lenz.

Of course, if you like killer astronaut films, the best was shot nearly 20 years before ALIEN CARGO, namely HORROR PLANET (aka, INSEMINOID).  HORROR PLANET's astronauts wield chainsaws, there's blood and gore, and there's even a carnivorous alien at the end.

I love horror/sci-fi films, but there are many gorier and more suspenseful ones than ALIEN CARGO.  Try the ALIEN series (if you haven't seen it already -- the first and fourth are the best), then check out HORROR PLANET, FORBIDDEN WORLD (not to be confused with the 1950s non-horror FORBIDDEN PLANET), and GALAXY OF TERROR.  Even TRAPPED IN SPACE is better.

ALIEN CARGO is okay, but only for highly forgiving, hardcore fans of ALIEN knockoffs.",1149897600,,2654,4.932279909706546
7914291,5,B00000K4YS,"This movie is a sleeper ""classic"" sci fi movie.  The movie

builds quite a bit of suspense and drama and has a real aura

of mystery - plus it has a very ""hopeful"" and ""promising""

ending.

The lead characters are honorable and much more believable

than the classic hollywood fare.",1141689600,4,282,4.54
7914292,2,B00000K4YS,"The crew of a transport spacecraft, whose route takes them between Titan and Mars, spends most of their trip in hibernation with only two crewmembers awake at any one time. It's not a fun job, but Chris (Jason London) and Theta (Missy Crider) manage to find a bit of excitement with an illicit affair that's against a strict company policy. Chris rigs the random draw that chooses shift mates so he and Theta can share a shift. When Chris and Theta awake for their stint, they find the ship is damaged, the previous shift's crew is missing, and they've been asleep far too long. In finding out what happened, they discover that they're also nearly out of fuel and life support and the previous crew brought aboard a mysterious piece of space debris. This debris is implicated in whatever happened to the ship. It becomes a race against time to save the remaining crew, while whatever happened to the missing crew begins to also affect Chris and then Theta.

To its credit, Alien Cargo's plot builds a fair bit of suspense and the acting of London and Crider is acceptable, even if nobody's going to win any awards for this effort. Most of the special effects look worse than what you'll find on a typical sci-fi television show, with the exception of the low gravity action, which does look pretty real. The ending at least partly makes up for the overall lack of excitement throughout the rest of the film. Alien Cargo also shares many, many similarities with Ridley Scott's Alien, in both plot and characters. You probably won't want to go out of your way to watch Alien Cargo, but it's enjoyable enough that a real sci-fi fan might find it worthwhile.",1032998400,5,1654,4.645051194539249
7914293,5,B00000K4YS,"If you are a Patrick O'Hearn fan, you'll love this flick, Patrick is one of the most influential New Age artists of our time, and he delivers a haunting score that is completely opposite of what a sci-fi horror flick is supposed to sound like.  This is film is low budget, so don't expect any fancy special effects, but the director managed to do some pretty cool stuff, I especially love the opening tracking shot, it lasts almost 2 minutes and starts outside the ship in deep space, zooms into the window and then follows a guy going nuts and destroying everything, anyways it's worth a look.",1002672000,4,594,4.5514018691588785
