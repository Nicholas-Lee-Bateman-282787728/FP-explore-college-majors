7333572,1,B011KG2LXQ,"I hated most of these the FIRST time around - and I still do! Let's face it - Brosnan is no Bond. He'd be way better as one of the villians with his higher pitched 'smooth' voice. Judy Dench cannot pull off a man's role as 'M' (which should stand for ""MAN"") without seeming like the 'bitch supremo', which is not fair to her as a consummate actRESS.
The only thing that saves the hideous plot lines and laughable scenarios are the gadgets, but even then, they are so 'specialized' that it begs the question 'how did Q know?' just what situation 'Bond' would end up in. I mean come on. To me this series sparked the beginning of 'ridiculous'
I love to have my belief suspended, but this is just farcical DISbelief. It's going on EBay. (Bet I can't GIVE it away!)",1487808000,,761,4.328671328671328

7333593,5,B011KG2LXQ,"Let me give a review of this product first then my opinion about the movies themselves. I love this product and most importantly the value i am getting out of it! For under $15, you get Blu Ray discs of the movies and you don't just get the Blu Rays alone but you also get digital copies of all these movies. That means you can also stream them or download these movies permanently using popular streaming services. What a deal! I grew up as a teen watching Pierce Brosnan Bond movies and i have been a huge fan since. He has got great style and class in the movies and a charm with the ladies when needed. All these movies deliver great action sequences with decent plot and cool cars good enough for the era these movies were made in. Enjoy!",1462406400,4,743,4.276595744680851

7333595,5,B011KG2LXQ,"Great box set for prime members.  All movies on separate DVDs.  If you want alot of extras though, buy the 007 anniversary box set.",1461456000,3,131,4.416666666666667
7333596,5,B011KG2LXQ,"This James Bond Collection was by far the best price possible at 10 dollars for all 4 movies of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  Second I have to agree with many people that Sean C and Pierce Brosnan are the two best James Bond actors of the Bonds I have watched so far in my lifetime.  Third though if you are a true Bond fan instead of having each movie seperate, you would invest like I did in these movie sets little by little until you get the whole James Bond sets.  The movies itself were amazing and no defects and well acted, great fight scenes, car chase scenes, and many other exciting things within the movie set.  So if you like James Bond movies or the actor himself then for sure invest the money for this movie set and savor some great movies and lay back and relax for a relaxing eveing with these movies.",1459555200,10,820,4.237179487179487
7333597,5,B011KG2LXQ,ill tell you there was more action in one brosnan james bond film then in all of the connery moore bonds put together the action never stops he was a great james bond never should of been replaced he should of done a few more and these blurays are a great deal.,1459036800,2,261,4.038461538461538

7333609,5,B011KG2LXQ,"$15 for the entire Pierce Brosnan James Bond collection? YES! I love it I love it! The only thing that could be better is the quality. I'm not sure if these are ""remastered"" for a Blu Ray I don't really think the quality is up to par with, let's say, a brand new James Bond money you'd see on Blu Ray. BUT, that may just be me.....

8724450,5,B011KG2LXQ,"I bought this collection mainly for the nostalgia. I know a lot of JB fans don't really like Pierce Brosnan as 007, but this is the guy who introduced me to the franchise. Goldeneye is quite arguably his best and it has a lot of sentimental value for me personally because not only I enjoyed the movie I also enjoyed the video game on the N64. I have fond memories of spending hours playing the game with family and friends. The other films didn't quite reached the success as Goldeneye, but I still liked TND, TWINE, and Die Another Day despite the terrible CGI effects like the Tsunami scene which is one of the worst scenes in the franchise, but it had the best music composed by David Arnold who's probably imo the closest composer as the late great John Barry. I would recommend this for any JB fan who grew up in the 90s like myself.",1533600000,,839,4.350318471337579

My only complaint, however, would be about the packaging, specifically the little center plastic things that hold the DVDs together. Two were already broken the first time I opened them, so 2 of the discs were out freely within the case..
