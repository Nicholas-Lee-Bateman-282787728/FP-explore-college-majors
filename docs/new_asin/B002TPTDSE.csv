3985648,5,B002TPTDSE,"Once again we witness Jean Dujardin's dead-on portrayal of playboy spy in action.  A must see for fans of comedy, satire, or spy movie genres.

Worth watching in the original French.",1356912000,,182,4.838709677419355
3985649,5,B002TPTDSE,"Not quite as good as ""Cairo: Nest of Spies"", but still a quality installment in the OSS 117 series.  If you enjoy dry and ridiculous humor, you will like OSS 117.  Just a fun, stupid spy parody.  Jean Dujardin is amazing (of course) and plays his stupid role perfectly.",1356566400,,269,4.448979591836735
3985650,5,B002TPTDSE,"I took a risk by purchasing this film before watching it. I watched the first film when I bumped into it at a local library. The first film, I watched it before the academy award winning  film, The Artist came out. The OSS 117 films are from the same director of The Artist and of course the amazing actor, Jean Dujardin. Good purchase and great seller!",1356048000,,353,4.348484848484849
3985651,5,B002TPTDSE,"Jean Dujardin is gut-splittingly hilarious! Do yourself a favor and buy, watch, or rent this one. It captures the 1960s beautifully.",1355875200,,132,5.333333333333333
3985652,3,B002TPTDSE,"This is a french spoof of the Bond franchise. As a result, it seems very reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie. The main difference between these two movies spoof heros is that the french version is a little bit more sophisticated. The movie is stupid-funny at points as well, but it does not need to get into the gutter to do so, rather it just gets politically incorrect at points which makes for a nice change of pace. Get it and laugh, then wonder why some foreign films are much better than the American garbage.",1332806400,,517,4.4526315789473685
3985653,5,B002TPTDSE,"How did the creator of The Artist gain enough credibility to make a silent film and have a Hollywood distributor take it on?  Among other things, he had great box office success with the two OSS 117 films in France.

To any true fan of cinema and/or the Bond films (and more directly the original French OSS 117 films!!), it is clear that these films are an act of love.  Jean DuJardin, the lead in The Artist, is the lead in both OSS films.  Berenice Bejo is his co-star in one of them.  The same attention to detail, to fidelity to the eras' filmmaking techniques, are present here. One would be hard-pressed to believe these two films were made at any time other than the decades they represent, right down to warm yet desaturated colors; opening credits; rear projection for car scenes, etc.

What is perhaps most fascinating is that the original character of OSS 117 upon which these spoof films were based was created in the decade BEFORE Ian Fleming created his own 007 -- the deeper you dig, the more entertainment you will find.  This is a fascinating point - at least one fight scene is lifted choreography for choreography from earlier French OSS 117 films dating back to '56, rather than the Bond films even as the music and many other touchers are unmistakably -- again -- an homage to Bond.  Perhaps even more wonderful, the stories have a political edge to them centering around male chauvinism and parochialism which are done to comedic perfection.  All in all, highly recommended.",1330300800,,1497,4.661596958174905
3985654,5,B002TPTDSE,"OSS117 Lost in Rio is really very funny. Jean Dujardin is a great actor. It's a French movie, so it may be useful to speak/understand French as the subtitles are not that great.",1327968000,2,177,4.393939393939394
3985655,2,B002TPTDSE,"Like all dumb spoofs, this one isn't really that funny.  It's a play on Bond but kind of a 1970 spoof instead of a modern spoof.  It certainly has a wonderful view of Rio but that's about it.",1317340800,,191,4.0
3985656,4,B002TPTDSE,"A pitch perfect parody of early spy films, ""Lost in Rio"" takes the french spy Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath to the beautiful country of Brazil for purposely unbelievable adventures involving hippies, Nazis, and ""Chinamen"". Using old school camera techniques, editing, and set design this film nails the aesthetics of 1960's era spy films and also manages to bring a few social issues from the time period, if only to make fun of them.

The character de La Bath, in the hands of Jean Dujardin, is light and charming even when he says things that are racist or sexist, something he does with such frequency and an unassuming nature that you wonder if it isn't that he looks down on people for what he perceives as there ""natural"" weaknesses, it's just the only way he can explain what is happening. An example of this is when his partner, female Mossad agent Dolors Koulechov does not laugh at his joke, he writes it off to her Jewish sense of humor.

In this sense de La Bath reminds me of a french Archer, the television spy cartoon character with which he seems to not only share occupation (spy) but also many personality traits (arrogance, promiscuity, a strange sense of humor). Similarly, and despite their seemingly best efforts to the contrary, both characters always end up doing the right thing and come out unscathed.

In summary: This movie is not to be taken seriously and takes a certain type of humor but if that is understood before hand it can be thoroughly enjoyed, if only ""for the ride.""",1314835200,6,1504,4.667924528301887

3985660,4,B002TPTDSE,"Quite funny. Watch the first of these two films first. The plots stand alone but it's worth experiencing the Egypt one before this Rio one. Not all the jokes are perfect, but the lead is one of the funniest actors I've ever seen.",1437868800,,229,4.348837209302325

3985665,5,B002TPTDSE,"Great movie and the books are great too. I like hearing the actors in their original voices and it helps with language learning. Why not have fun while learning? Jean duJardin is amazing through and through. Storyline is as would be expected, crude humor. So you need a sense of humor to enjoy this sense of humor. Absolutely no disappointments here.

3985666,2,B002TPTDSE,"The first one was great, this was racist, sexist, and unfunny. I can appreciate that sort of humor in the first movie because it was done in the ""right"" way, but this is just tasteless and more of the same.",1406073600,,206,4.175

3985689,3,B002TPTDSE,"While I dislike Jean Dujardin as a human being, I can't deny his acting chops.  As a spoof of the famed 007 and the spy genre in general, Dujardin and the director both nail the feeling, tone, and somewhat slapdash pacing of classic spy films.  Some of the comedy fell flat for me, but overall I found this to be a rewarding viewing experience.",1392854400,,344,4.359375
3985690,4,B002TPTDSE,Fun film. Lots of tongue in cheek humor. Jean Du Jardin is a very talented actor. Looking forward to more of his films.,1391472000,,119,4.217391304347826
3985691,2,B002TPTDSE,Not worth watching. This level of humor went out with satin shirts. Good if you're between 6 and 10 years old.,1390867200,,110,4.285714285714286

3985694,4,B002TPTDSE,"A good break from American comedy. Some of the humor is just goofy but there is other humor that you really have to pay attention to understand. And, you should also have an understanding of French culture to get some of the humor.",1381449600,,231,4.395348837209302

3985696,2,B002TPTDSE,My Girl friend really enjoyed this DVD. I understand the French just loved Jerry Lewis ... He never did much for me and neither does this film.,1379289600,,143,4.333333333333333
3985697,4,B002TPTDSE,"This movie is hilarious and Jean Dujardin proves he can act as well as speak (Oscar winner for ""The Artist"", silent film)! Gave this movie four stars only because it is English subtitled, even though it really doesn't matter and one can follow the action with or without the subtitles. Great lighthearted comedy!",1376784000,,312,4.90566037735849
3985698,5,B002TPTDSE,"See my review for the first Jean du Jardin spy film, OSS117 Nest of Spies. This one is not quite as funny but I gave it 5 stars, anyway because the entire series is genius and, if you are a fan of early Bond, it's worth watching this one just for the art design. It looks so much like Dr. No and other Connery films, it's amazing. The director really knew his source material. And, on top of all that, it's freaking hilarious.",1376265600,,426,4.144578313253012

3985700,3,B002TPTDSE,"I watched it on a whim because it had 4-1/2 stars.  I did watch the whole thing and don't plan on watching it again.

Funny in spots, tedious and protracted in many others...okay for one viewing but not on the same level as spy spoofs such as ""Johnny English"" which I can watch over and over again.",1366848000,,298,4.2105263157894735
3985701,5,B002TPTDSE,The movie is funny and very relaxing. I think the actor playing the main role is excellent! The movie is well done,1365811200,,114,4.2272727272727275

3985705,5,B002TPTDSE,Enjoyed the movie - loved that it was filmed as a 50's/60's movie. Loved the Bond-like scenes. Hope they make a follow on movie!,1360627200,,128,4.375
3985706,4,B002TPTDSE,"The other OSS flick is funny, too. The close quarters comedy gunfights from which the main character emerges unscathed are the type that, (after this flick, anyway), shouldn't be explored by film makers ever, ever again. Please. But yeah. This character is a classic in my mind already. Great lead. Great supporting cast members. Sets, scenery, wardrobe... during the early stages of the other oss movie, which I watched slightly before, I thought it WAS a movie from the 40's - I thought with wide eyed amazement that I'd missed something for years and years. Anyway, if you have a pulse, you probably will get a laugh or two out of this one.

It's subtitled, with funny effect. Jokes told/ read in English that rhyme (toward the end), don't rhyme in French, but the characters raucously laugh as if they do while they're speaking. Kind of quirky. Good flick.",1359417600,,860,4.771812080536913
8380482,5,B002TPTDSE,"Very funny movie.  Hopefully the other movie, Nid dEspions, will be easily available on blu Ray in the US at some point",1526342400,,119,4.409090909090909

8380484,1,B002TPTDSE,"I don't understand. The subtitles on this blu-ray were so appallingly bad I don't see how anyone could have watched this and thought ""Yeah, this is ok I guess"".

The movie itself is great. That's why I bought it, but the subtitles were all out of sync and poorly translated. A pity. I don't know if there are any alternative blu-ray editions.

Too bad :(",1508976000,,354,4.430769230769231

8380487,3,B002TPTDSE,"An stumbling, awkward follow-up to Cairo, Nest of Spies. It has its moments, but not many.",1484092800,,90,4.6875
8380488,3,B002TPTDSE,"Good French spoof. Even though it was only released in 2009, it's dated and feels like your watching the Our Man Flint and Matt Helms movies of the 60s, but it was funny, although poorly edited, written and directed. Hard to believe the lead actor is the same actor who so wonderfully played ""The Artist"" in the Oscar nominated and winning movie. It held my interest, but I just can't see giving it 4 stars.",1477094400,,407,4.44
8380489,3,B002TPTDSE,"Lumpy and uneven, poorly paced and unfocused, this spoof of the Bond films, set in 1967, has precious few chuckles as it illuminates what an outmoded character James Bond really is for the 21st Century.  There are some delicious nods to Hitchcock, particularly at the climax that manages to combine elements of VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and SABOTEUR.  The last 10 minutes and the end titles are cleverly done.  But when a movie's best element is the end credits, we know we're in trouble.  They aren't worth waiting for (and won't make sense if you haven't watched the whole movie, so it's useless to skip to them.  But don't miss them if you've waded through this whole rambling, overlong comedy.)

For the rest, we watch Dujardin (who is dashing enough to probably play Bond for real) as a sexist, racist, xenophobic,ignorant boor, cluelessly make highly inappropriate and embarrassing comments about Jews, Muslims, women, you name it, right to the offended parties' faces.  Not my brand of humor, I admit.  It's a very French film, all right.  And maybe an inadvertent comment on France's anti-Semitism?

""You're old.  Pretentious.  A misogynist.  Full of yourself.  Vain.  Borderline racist,"" our superagent's female foil from Israel berates him when he attributes her refusal of his advances to her Jewish ethnicity.  The Nazi boss they are pursuing sums up his vision of the future as, ""A world more unfair.  A world more intolerant.  More unfriendly.  Where there will always be war.""

Remind you of anyone in 2016?

In light the Trump Presidential campaign, this film is especially painful to watch, an accidental political commentary originally meant just to be a French farce.  But it's no longer a joke in today's political climate of terrorism and demagoguery.",1476576000,,1775,5.048275862068966
8380490,5,B002TPTDSE,"Jean Dujardin makes fun of James Bond in his unique French way. Even if you hate reading subtitles, you will LOVE this movie. I have watched it twice, and I'm not usually a fan of European films. However, if you're tired of PG-13 wussy films, you will love OSS 117. In fact, this is one of those rare movies that are better than its predecesor: OSS 116 Lost in Cairo.",1463702400,,367,4.257142857142857
