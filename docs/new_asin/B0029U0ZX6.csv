3881054,5,B0029U0ZX6,A great movie about how simple and meaningful the life could be. A story about a true relation between humans and the nature.,1295568000,8,125,4.478260869565218

3881058,3,B0029U0ZX6,"The movie has the flavor of a couple of hippie, earth worshiping, primitives who think living an 18th century lifestyle makes them closer to mother earth. Their only child, a 17 year old was killed when his canoe tipped over in a lake near their cabin. Oh well; so much for the nature and beauty and  yeah my only son drowned. Kind of makes the primitive utopia less appealing.",1417219200,2,377,4.463768115942029

3881061,4,B0029U0ZX6,It was a good show but it looked like some of the pretty scenery had a brownish tone instead of color.  It was more of a documentary than a film.  It also shows them killing and gutting animals but they are only doing it for their survival.,1399507200,,240,4.085106382978723
3881062,5,B0029U0ZX6,"Not only did the family live and thrive in the wilderness, but thanks to their talent and devotion, they filmed it, so we could enjoy it generations later. Big thanks to them for providing such incredible and historical footage. If you like this movie, you will also enjoy a book called ""Born on Snow Shoes"", by Evelyn Berglund Shore. Cheers,
Lars",1397347200,2,347,4.704918032786885
3881063,4,B0029U0ZX6,"I'm surprised I've never heard of this film as I've lived in Alaska nearly 40 yrs. It is shot in the beautiful Brooks Range which has a reputation of world class beauty and hunting. Early adventurers were able to get in on some choice locations with lake access such as this which are rarely available today.
Yearly on the Anchorage PBS fundraiser they air the well known classic ""Alone in the Wilderness"" featuring the legendary Dick Proenneke who lived alone in the Lake Clark/Iliamna area for most of his life. An Alaskan favorite, you might enjoy it too.",1393545600,6,558,4.704081632653061
3881064,1,B0029U0ZX6,This was a very poor quality movie it was a very unclear picture I turned it off after the first 5 min.,1392854400,,103,3.727272727272727

They are the same movie.

I love this film and I wish everyone had a chance to see it.

At the time of this post, Year of the Caribou DVD costs approximately 2 1/2 times The Alaska Wilderness Adventure DVD from Synergy Entertainment.

I bought 4 Alaska Wilderness DVDs to give to friends, but I was disappointed in the video quality and returned them.

My other comments about this movie and video quality are in my review and comments under&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Year-of-the-Caribou/dp/B002UKOOAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Year of the Caribou</a>.",1391904000,,968,8.544554455445544
3881066,5,B0029U0ZX6,"I stumbled upon this instant video and it's one of the best things I've seen in a long time. I actually watched it twice in one day.

It is the story of a family who lived in the northern Alaska wilderness from 1960 to 1975(ish) - in the Brooks Mountain Range deep in the Arctic Circle, 250 miles from the nearest road and 70 miles from the nearest town. The film is comprised of home videos beautifully shot and narrated. It somehow conveys the experience of living in that glorious wild place, attuned and a part of nature; and of the inner transformation that gradually took place in them.

It's a wonderful film, a real work of art.

There's an interview of Elaine Meader here: http://jukebox.uaf.edu/GatesN/html/2705-1.htm. It contains a great deal of detail about their lives in the wilderness that didn't make it into the film.",1391817600,5,834,4.698630136986301
3881067,5,B0029U0ZX6,"Although I wondered what the reasons were to motivate this family to ""escape"" civilization the movie depicts their wonderful adaptability into a very harsh and unforgiving environment. It teaches the viewer how to learn new techniques in order to survive.",1391040000,2,255,5.4
3881068,3,B0029U0ZX6,Mediocre video quality but some good wildlife views and sounds.  Overall story was informative and interesting.  More information on how the family chose the specific area would have been interesting.,1387065600,,200,5.633333333333334
3881069,5,B0029U0ZX6,"Finally!  A true and accurate documentary of what life in Alaska is really like! Unlike some of the ""reality"" shows about Alaska filmed today that have been produced merely to generate ratings, I found this to be the best documentary on life in Alaska I've ever seen(and I think I've seen every one of them)!  Filmed in the 70's, you will witness exactly how hard life is when you have to do EVERYTHING for yourself to survive!!  Older, yes, but a must see if you're serious about survival in Alaska.",1386547200,3,500,4.533333333333333
3881070,4,B0029U0ZX6,"I'm an adventure racer and survivalist myself, this is a true story of a truly adventure/survival in one of the most isolated regions of the world today, let alone back in those days, either you are in tune with nature or you will die and be reabsorbed by it!",1380240000,,259,4.3061224489795915
3881071,5,B0029U0ZX6,"LOVED THE MOVIE...WELL WORTH WATCHING...I DO LOVE ALASKA

3881072,2,B0029U0ZX6,Didn't watch it all because of film condition.  It's not going to be a repeater because I probably will never want to see it again.,1375228800,,131,4.24
3881073,5,B0029U0ZX6,VERY BEAUTIFUL SCEANERY.  GREAT DOCUMENTARY ON ANIMALS ETC.  WILDLIFE IN THEIR OWN HABITATS IS A WONDERFUL WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THEM.,1363737600,5,131,5.190476190476191

8358256,5,B0029U0ZX6,"All footage shot by the family makes this film  of wilderness survival much more real and gripping than any slick, beautifully produced ""professional"" film could be.  The voice-overs are well done, and the entire effect is to give one a realistic view of the trials and joys of wilderness living.  Well worth your time.",1448236800,,319,4.87037037037037

8358258,3,B0029U0ZX6,"I wasn't sure if this was a 3. It wasn't bad per se... it just drug along. I think it is, in part, a very old movie. The story is good, but there are stories (Dick Proenneke In Alaska) that seem more timeless. I am glad I watched it, and I enjoyed the story, though somewhat sad, I did feel a little uplifted by the end.",1444521600,,320,3.8636363636363638

8358260,3,B0029U0ZX6,It was an interesting and straight forward documentary.  I'm grateful that they took the years to make a film about homesteading in the Alaskan wilderness.,1431820800,,155,5.2
8358261,4,B0029U0ZX6,"I noticed some people thought that it was too slow moving in the ratings. However the story was good, reminiscent of the peace and simplicity of that type of existence. It wasn't an action movie, but an adventure just the same.",1431734400,,227,4.560975609756097
