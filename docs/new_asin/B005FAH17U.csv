4673643,5,B005FAH17U,"I can't imagaine a more enjoyable 110 minutes than this DVD of Chopin, Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin. I've watched the DVD three times and each time is more enjoyable than the last. The handsome Philharmonic Hall in Essen seats 1900+ and I did not notice a single empty seat. One end of the hall is dominated by the 2004 Kuhn organ of some 4500 pipes and a gallery surrounds the hall; I can't help but wonder how the orchestra sounds seated above and behind the stage. I'd love to visit.

Conductor Andris Nelsons is fun to watch and the video gives us just the right amount of his expressions and gestures to be entertaining. The video editing between conductor, orchestra, Barenboim and audience seems ideal. I have a 15 year old tube type TV with a Bose audio system and the picture and sound are excellent even on this ""out of date"" TV and sound system.

As to Daniel's playing of Chopin...I'm no pianiost (I do play) and not an expert on Chopin by any means. But this was a perfectly delightful hour and a half for me. I especially loved the encore: Chopin's Valse brillante in A minor. All in all this DVD is well worth the price...try it, I'm sure you will find it so also.",1396569600,5,1189,4.424657534246576
4673644,5,B005FAH17U,"I really enjoyed the concertos even though I was not as familiar with some of these selections. Chopin is one of my favorite composers, and Daniel Barenboim plays his compositions with skill and feeling.",1382313600,4,203,5.0
4673645,5,B005FAH17U,This is no doubt my most favorite DVD of Daniel Barenboim.  He has got to be the most wonderful pianist I have ever heard.  I wish I could see and hear him in person some day.  The music on this DVD reduces me to tears every time I listen to it.  Daniel Barenboim puts so much expression and feeling into it.  The music just reaches deep down inside.  I have shared it with others and know I will listen to it over and over again.,1368835200,14,430,4.0
4673646,5,B005FAH17U,Barenboim never disappoints an audience whether he is conducting Wagner or playing piano concertos on a blu-ray. This is one of his best performances.,1367884800,11,150,5.291666666666667
4673647,5,B005FAH17U,"Hard on the heels of the excellent Warsaw 2010 Accentus production (the Chopin concertos with Demidenko, Kissin and Wit, see my review) comes Barenboim with the Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Andris Nelsons in a live recording from the 2010 Ruhr Festival. A direct comparison is not productive, because the three soloists - each technically perfect and very much in tune with the music's idiom - display a radically different approach to the concertos: where Demidenko is thoughtful and introverted, Kissin temperamental and overwhelmingly brilliant, Barenboim appears to be exploring the spirit of these scores anew in an almost searching way. He can be ham-fisted and hard- hitting (see his DVD recording of the Beethoven concertos), but certainly not in his approach to Chopin which is refined and sensitive to every nuance. His performances are fresh and unique and I will return to them often. The Staatskapelle under the baton of the inspired and enthusiastic Nelsons marvelously supports him every step of the way. The Haydn E minor symphony is a nice filler and played very well. The video is very good. As to the audio, I can not quite agree with John R. Springer. I find the (stereo) soundtrack more than acceptable and fairly free from distortion, though not among today's best. If you love Chopin, get this disk.",1318636800,33,1327,5.063926940639269

8469819,5,B005FAH17U,This is an excellent version of the Beethoven Concertos.  The performance is amazing.  The sound quality and video are excellent.  I live far from any major city.

8469825,5,B005FAH17U,"I have never heard a bad performance of these two concertos. They epitomize the Slavonic romanticism of Chopin's keyboard music, with the added advantage of an orchestral score to match. Structurally and developmentally, they are simple and straightforward. They are to the piano Concerto what Max Bruch's violin concertos are to that musical form. If they had never been written, the history of music would have been unaltered. But their very simplicity and directness speaks to the audience in a melodically appealing way. I found that Barenboim had a problem with them that he had to strive hard to overcome: their lack of intellectual content. Probably the greatest musical intellect of our present generation as pianist and conductor, he relies on an intellectual challenge to bring out the best in his performances. Lacking one here, he is almost wrong-footed from the start, and he is virtually forced to invent formal problems where none exist. I have heard Lipatti , Zimmerman, and Bella Davidovich  sail through these works without a single furrow of the brow. That is not Barenboim's style. There has to be a life beneath every glittering surface, and it is this Holy Grail that he pursues. One can therefore summarize his performances as graceful, playful and profound. In sacrificing some of the surface joy in favour of emphasizing their depths, he has succeeded in raising them to a level of respect that one rarely encounters. I prefer this approach to the hedonism that other interpreters emphasize as their major virtue. The sound and camera work are excellent and a useful brochure is included. Fine cameos of the instrumentalists of the Staatskapelle Berlin as well as of the soloist abound, and the Concert Hall at Essen in the Ruhr is a delightful venue, packed with distinguished-looking musical enthusiasts who force Barenboim into a poetic encore of Chopin's Valse Brillante Op 34/2 , a work more deserving of the title Valse Triste.
The conductor is Andris Nelsons who starts the whole program with a competent interpretration of Haydn's Mourning Symphony. He is young and enthusiastic, but very immature in his persona, prancing and strutting with a fixed meaningless smile. It almost comes across as a declaration:""see how good I really am"". It is something he will have to bring under control if he is not to irritate future audiences as he did me.",1397952000,8,2377,5.048346055979644
