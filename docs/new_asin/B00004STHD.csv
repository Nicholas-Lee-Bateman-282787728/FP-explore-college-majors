7921920,5,B00004STHD,"Most enjoyable, excellent presentation, loaded with facts and history. Shows planes from all angles. Teaches about flight in an appealing way while encouraging you to follow your dreams. Good mix of live action and animation. Good child narrator. Children loved learning about all different types of airplanes and afterwards wanted to see an air-show or become a pilot. The cartoons were a big hit. ""I loved the acrobatic flying."" ""I'd like to know about the plane my grandpa flew in WWII."" Best for ages 5 to 8.",1000425600,3,512,4.896551724137931
