2664172,1,B000IY0BPC,"I have wanted the complete Burke's Law series for years, and when I found this listing I was thrilled. HOWEVER, when I received it,  (excellent seller, fast shipping, etc--no problem) I found it wouldn't play--it was marked ""Region 0""--in spite of being listed with Amazon as ""all regions"". I returned the set with no problem, & was given a refund, but I see that the information given still lists it as ""all regions"" (all the sellers are in the UK).  Maybe my experience precipitated a change in the region of the DVD, but I would warn any buyers to contact Amazon or the seller to be sure you purchase the right region for your player (I believe US/Canada is region 1). Good luck!!",1359676800,18,683,4.544715447154472
8147663,5,B000IY0BPC,The feature I like the most about Burke's Law is the fabulous Rolls Royce Silver Cloud he is chauffered to work in..Amos Burke has the most beautiful car on TV.He is also the coolest detective (and best dressed) in L.A.Although I was only seven years old when the series first aired the eye catching show stuck with me and it is nice to see it again on DVD.I am loving series one - but where is series two ?,1515888000,,407,4.1645569620253164
8147664,4,B000IY0BPC,"I am enjoying these shows thoroughly; they're a great throw back to the cool early sixties.  Gene Barry is suave, cool & calm.  Regis Toomey is also very good.  There's several well known performers appearing as extras in each episode.  The plot lines are fun.  This show is no great classic but it's well worth the money.",1510617600,,322,4.578947368421052
8147665,5,B000IY0BPC,"I LOVE this series. HOWEVER, when is the second and third series coming out??? Come on, whoever owns the rights, we want the second and third seasons!!!!",1509926400,,153,4.703703703703703
8147666,4,B000IY0BPC,"Fast-paced for its time, very witty & dry, & a good murder mystery in each episode. Dozens of well-known guest stars of all kinds, playing against type: William Bendix, Nanette Fabray & Dorothy Lamour as villains; Dina Merrill as an alcoholic, street-walking, nymphomaniac; Annette Funicello as an apparently psychotic teenage movie star who eats morning glories & tries to hang herself with her bikini. Zsa Zsa Gabor as a maid!
 Countless stars shine as character types they'd never before been allowed to play. A must-see for those who like old Hollywood & good mysteries. Gene Barry is perfect.",1505520000,,597,5.091836734693878
8147667,5,B000IY0BPC,"Episodes are well written and chockablock with the celebrities of the time.  Of course, the lead character is wealthy, but his wealth doesn't go to his head even if it goes to the audience's head.  This is a Spelling formula later repeated with The Love Boat, Hart to Hart, Dynasty, and many others.  Burke's Law is the granddaddy of them all.",1494201600,,343,4.590163934426229
8147668,5,B000IY0BPC,"I liked this set, restoration was done very well. I can't wait until I can get seasons 2 & 3.",1477526400,,93,3.7

8147671,4,B000IY0BPC,"Gene Barry is 60's cool incarnate.  This premise is made for his brand of suave, easy charm.  It's not complex or intense, just well produced, well intentioned fun.",1430870400,,164,4.821428571428571
8147672,5,B000IY0BPC,loved this witty old detective show with actor Gene Barry. Fun to watch. Can't wait for season two to be released,1359676800,6,113,4.428571428571429
