7385750,3,B014C20UU6,"I was super excited to be able to share this great show with my kids, but this set lacks the most important part of the series: The first 5 episodes. The first episode on Volume 1, Disk 1 is actually the 6th episode of the series. As great as the show is, without the initial framing story presented in the missing episode 1 (Don't Give Up the Ship) my kids were super confused as to why Donald's nephews were hanging out with Scrooge. Really, even with having watched the entire series as a kid, the show makes zero sense without those first 5 episodes (collectively referred to as The Treasure of the Golden Suns), as they set up the premise for the entire rest of the series.

The quality of the three-disk set is fine overall, aside from this, but you'll want to find a copy of DuckTales: The Treasure of the Golden Suns before you try watching these...",1505606400,9,857,4.389937106918239
7385751,5,B014C20UU6,I grew up watching this show and I absolutely love this set. It has every episode! I can't wait to share these with my children ,1505088000,,128,4.12
7385752,4,B014C20UU6,"One of the cartoons I loved as a Child, now shared with my children...and they love them!  Only reason not 4 stars is that you need to crank the volume up drastically to hear it (normal discs on my dvd player - volume at maybe lvl 20, these discs, lvl 40+).  ...also season 1 seems to missing the first episode that I remember.  Still love making new memories with my kids AND singing the intro song!",1504483200,,400,4.2368421052631575
7385753,2,B014C20UU6,The dvds are constantly skipping. They also black out,1503878400,,53,5.0
7385754,5,B014C20UU6,"It's not the complete series, as Disney never released all the episodes, but it is the complete amount that was released. Just so you know going in.",1501372800,7,148,4.518518518518518
7385755,5,B014C20UU6,"This was my favorite cartoon as a child! The theme song was the best and it brings back great memories, especially since older cartoons aren't aired much anymore. This was when cartoons were made for kids.",1498780800,,205,4.722222222222222
7385756,2,B014C20UU6,This is NOT the complete series. I'm missing 24 episodes mostly from the end of the third season!,1498435200,7,97,4.444444444444445

7385759,5,B014C20UU6,DuckTales honestly needs no explanation of its brilliance. If you don't know then I urge you to get this collection because it'll change your life! Absolute Brilliance!,1492905600,,168,5.2592592592592595
7385760,3,B014C20UU6,"I loved this show as a kid and watched its first run back in 1987. The transference from VHS to DVD looks great to okay to blurry. There is also color issues where episodes look faded. I wish that every episode was crisp. The menus are all also generic. I would have loved to have seen semantics with maps and an inside look of the mansion and money bin, but there are no special features. The episodes are out of order, but because I'm Ducktales savvy, I was able to show them to my son properly. Several episodes are missing, hopefully we'll get a volume IV. Because these are the only discs available, it is a must buy for all fans.",1492128000,,635,4.256198347107438
7385761,5,B014C20UU6,"I absolutely LOVED DuckTales as a kid. I watched it all the time, and it led to an interest in Disney Duck comics which has been a life-long hobby that's brought a great deal of enjoyment. While these DVDs are barebones (no extras to speak of), when I bought them in 2007 I was pleased thinking I had the ENTIRE series. Just tonight I realized that I was sadly mistaken--DISNEY STIFFS THEIR CARTOON FANS AGAIN!!

Disney has treated their TV animation properties like dirt, despite a whole generation of kids who were raised on them and still love them now. These beloved cartoon series (DuckTales, Gummi Bears, Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Gargoyles, etc.) have been given lackluster DVD releases with no extras, the cheapest packaging possible, and then to add insult to injury---they leave EVERY DVD SERIES SET INCOMPLETE! ""Here's mud in your eye, fans! Thanks for all the money you made us!""

DuckTales has remained so popular and well known, that a remade version of the classic Nintendo game was released for modern systems in 2013---TWENTY FOUR YEARS LATER. And now because the series remains so popular, Disney is REMAKING THE SERIES ITSELF to start airing in 2017. How can something so popular be given such garbage treatment by the studio that spawned it?

So, here's a thought, Disney execs--if the original is still so popular over a quarter of a century after it aired, how about doing the fans a solid by releasing the REAL COMPLETE SERIES on DVD? And if you really value your fans, how about Blu-Ray? If it's so popular it's worth remaking, how about honoring the original by releasing it in full?

I mean, seriously--you release stomach-ulcer inducing Pirates of the Caribbean 2-4 to great fanfare on every format imaginable, and you can't give Uncle Scrooge a few measly DVDs? Just take it out of the budget for the next Pirates movie. Seriously, no one will miss it.",1488844800,6,1879,4.808049535603715

7385766,4,B014C20UU6,"70 episodes... to be ""Complete"" the number should be 100! (with The Movie, 101]

An amazing series - I used to see it with my kids. BUT there is a problem with the term ""complete"" for the box:
 - there were 101 episodes of DuckTales. One of them a movie with more than one hour. This box has only 70 episodes and they did not released the 3rd and the 4th Seasons (as we see the sequences at TV.com, episode guide for this series). Examples:  [DuckTales Season 3] Episode 01 The Land of Tra-la-la to 18 A Ducktales Valentine;
 and [DuckTales, Season 4 Episode 01 Ducky Mountain High to 06 The Golden Goose (part 1 and ). Did Disney DVD let us without the REAL complete Series, forever? And why? One more box of 2 or 3 DVS would have solved the case...",1461974400,53,750,4.223776223776224

Perhaps the carrier did something? The update gave a delay. I simply don't understand why this series arrived in a very poor state.",1513814400,,303,4.735849056603773
8730191,5,B014C20UU6,this was the perfect gift for my granddaughter and daughter. It brought back memories for my daughter that she wanted the pass along to her daughter.
