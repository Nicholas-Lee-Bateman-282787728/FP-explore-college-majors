5847231,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"In The Perfect Summer, fatherless teenager Jake (Adam Horner) has to leave Chicago and move with his mom (Sydney Penny) to a small surfing town to live with her father (Eric Roberts) when she needs help supporting them. With no home internet, cable, or friends, the transition isn't easy and Jake isn't quite ready to accept the changes.

While using the internet at the local surf shop, owned by Cody (Jason Castro), Jake is attracted to a young surfing prodigy, Kayla (Katie Garfield)... which makes him an instant enemy to the town bully, Tyler (JD Banks). In an effort to fit in, and spend more time with Kayla, Jake agrees when his grandfather, Lou, offers to teach him how to surf. Through these surfing lessons, Jake also learns lessons in life about determination, facing fears, and rising above the challenges when all seems to be crashing around you.

""The Perfect Summer"" was written by Nathan Scoggins and Gary Wheeler; Wheeler also directed the film. The dvd is 85 minutes long and suitable for most audiences. The bullying scenes may be too violent for younger viewers, but it is a clean, wholesome movie.

 My Review: Despite some criticisms I have, I honestly did enjoy watching this movie. It has a message about moving along with your life no matter how awful things may seem, whether it is due to your own mistakes or when circumstances occur that causes life to pivot. Yet, it is not told in a preachy manner that will turn off the audience it is intended to reach. It can be enjoyed as a simple entertainment or used to start a discussion based on topic or characters

The film moves along in a predictable direction and I did think some of the roles were caricatures of the same type that appears in countless films. That's not to say that the acting was not good; I have just seen these people in nearly every beach film from when I watched ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" as a child on up to the most recent films. There were also a couple of things that did not quite make sense to me.

The movie is worth watching. Being predictable is not always a bad thing, and I did think the acting was solid. I enjoy watching Eric Roberts in everything I have ever seen him in, and this film is no exception. Both Sydney Penny and Louis Mandylor are seasoned professionals who give great performances. With the exception of Jason Castro (whom I know only as a singer), I don't know the younger actors in the film, but felt they all did justice to their roles.

 I received The Perfect Summer compliments of Word Films and Edify Media for my honest review. I was not required to write a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own.",1405296000,,2660,4.561844863731656
5847232,5,B00DQ6S5OS,"The Perfect Summer is such a fantastic DVD. It is highly entertaining and full of lessons and hope. Some of the actors in this superb movie are Eric Roberts, Sydney Penny, Louis Mandylor, Adam Horner, Katie Garfield with Jason Castro.
  Jake and his mom have to move in with her father, because her husband died and she cant make it where they use to live. Its hard to change where you live especially after losing such an important person in your life.
  By the description on the DVD back it seems to be such a simple story full of sun, fun and romance, but The Perfect Summer is really a deep movie where many emotions are shown and how this young man grows up and where he puts his priorities.
  You will enjoy the fun and sun, but also feel such love and heartache. The feelings run deep in this DVD. It really is an enjoyable one to watch and one to learn from. Highly recommended.

5847233,5,B00DQ6S5OS,"Moving from everything you know and leaving your past behind to start over is hard enough. Especially for 17-year-old Jake Reynolds. He has already lost his father just last summer and now his mother, Alyssa (Sydney Penny) has left their family home in Chicago to move in with her father, Lou Reynolds (Erik Roberts) in North Carolina. She thinks the beach town is the perfect place for Jake to find his roots and perhaps a fresh start at a new life. But Jake is pretty determined to stay resentful of his situation despite how welcoming his grandfather is. The one thing he isn't expecting is to learn that cell phone coverage and Wifi isn't something that is available and he will have to seek it out in town at the nearby surf shop and cafe owned by Cody (Jason Castro, American Idol).

Jake thinks he may have found something to interest him beside the internet when he meets Kayla, a beautiful surfer girl who seems interested in him. But things go from bad to worse, when Kayla's ex boyfriend Tyler seems to think that Jake better find a new interest and hurry. Kayla reminds him that they are no longer a couple and she can do whatever she wants with her time and see anyone she pleases. But like all good bullies, that only adds fuel to the fire. No matter where Jake goes, trouble with Tyler follows and soon he is shown just how forceful they can be when they beat him up and break the surfboard his grandfather has loaned him.

Ashamed and feeling less than worthy, Jake feels that moving back to Chicago might be better than trying to fit in with his grandfather. His mother has found an ideal job working as a travel agent and believes they are finally on the right track. But there is always hope in starting over and learning to never live with regrets, something his grandfather has learned after leaving his own daughter behind. He offers to teach Jake how to surf, but the one thing Jake never realizes is that his grandfather is a surfing legend until he learns to trust and accept things on his own terms.

I received The Perfect Summer compliments of Word Films and Edify Media for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. This is such a great movie because it focuses on handling issues within the family from bullying, to regrets, to sobriety and shows how God's grace can give us all a fresh start at life and to begin to live our lives without regrets. Everyone can have a second chance if we are willing to leave our past mistakes behind us! This is such a great DVD for the entire family and the surfing is amazing. I easily give this a 5 out of 5 stars and family approved by the Dove Foundation and Uplifting Entertainment.",1404691200,,2749,4.483033932135728
5847234,5,B00DQ6S5OS,"This was an uplifting and heart-warming story that will make you come back for more in the end. I really enjoyed watching the movie with my kids and the message it shares is definitely family friendly and one that I want my kids to learn in their own lives. While I really did not know most of the actors, the movie was still strong and the acting admirable. In the end though for me, it was the overall message and take-away that I enjoyed most in the movie itself, and I believe that any family will find this to be true also!

5847250,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"Summertime and beach movies go together like peanut butter and jelly, right? But beach/surfer movies can be a dime a dozen. Fortunately, The Perfect Summer is more than just another typical summer beach flick. The film explores loss, regret, family relational difficulties, and the necessity of digging deep to discover the courage and strength to overcome. It teaches that a life lived in fear is no life at all.

With a small cast, its important that all the actors capture their characters and give engaging, convincing performances. From top to bottom, this cast gets it done. Eric Roberts (brother to Julia and father to Emma) commands the screen as Lou, Jakes grandfather. Its easy to imagine how just a short time living with Lou could draw Jake out of his isolation. Of course, meeting a pretty girl doesnt hurt, either. It turns out Kayla (Katie Garfield) is fighting her own personal battles, and the two teenagers bond while sharing their brokenness. Adam Horners portrayal of Jake is strong. I especially liked his use of body language to show a shy, awkward teen. As Jake gains confidence, we can really see and feel the difference. The storyline with Jakes mother and her new employer (Sydney Penny and Louis Mandylor) is enjoyable. Sydney Penny, who reminded me of Tia Carrere, is especially likable and Mandylor has an easy charm. Even Christian Music artist and American Idol alum Jason Castro breezily pulls off his small part as Cody, the friendly surf shop owner.

The movie talks at length about not giving up when life gets hard. The family has their past, and Lou has regrets but welcomes the chance to start afresh. His mentoring of Jake is full of love and wisdom, with healthy doses of humor and humility. When we learn about Lous past and his personal mistakes, its not hard to understand why its so important to him to help Jake navigate his own rough waters.

(Ive got to say this, too: I loved that this wasn't one of those movies where a neophyte finds hes a quick study and natural talent, so he just *poof* becomes the best.)

Verdict: 4 of 5 Hearts. Uplifting Summer Family Film. Without getting preachy, UP TV original film The Perfect Summer, a heartwarming tale about a young mans journey through loss, inspires viewers, reminding us that we have the courage to overcome if well just keep trying.

5847252,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"Eric Roberts takes the cake in the movie. The surfing scenes are just okay, nothing like Endless Summer, Chasing Mavericks, or Chasing Giants, but it is all in good fun and it shows how a young 17 year old learns to cope with the unexpected occurrences of life, with the help of a loving family, and a couple of minor bullies to add conflict. Some are bound to enjoy it a lot more than we did, but then again with all the movies of past, present, and future, this one is just an average movie that entertained for a while, but not the great 5 Stars other reviewers have given this film. 3.5 Stars.",1407628800,,597,4.245614035087719
5847253,3,B00DQ6S5OS,"Do not agree with fellow reviewers claiming this is a 5 Star movie. If it was a 5 Star movie then it would be right there, side to side, with Chasing Mavericks, and believe me when I say this movie is not even in a remote way as good as Chasing Mavericks. It is a nice movie, with a very simplistic story line that at times looses credibility for how predictable it is. Eric Roberts brings a lot of class to this movie, being perhaps the best actor of the bunch, while the rest of the cast fulfill their roles with no problems, but with no out of this world performance. Perhaps this movie is mainly a family movie that does not intend to break any barriers, as it is a good hearted film at the end of the day. For those who have seen really good footage of surfing films, the surfing scenes here leave much to be desired. This is a bland movie about trying to cope in the face of adversity, but not enough to give it an edge. Nice characters, with a couple of silly baddies, and $4.99 price for viewing earns a 3.5 Stars.",1407456000,,1022,4.14070351758794
5847254,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.

  Broken families, lost dreams, fears, grief.  Only one redeemer can make all things work together for good for those who love Christ.  We, however, can show the love of Christ and make a real difference, too.  The Perfect Summer is a story of redeeming love, compassion, courage, and hope.  After her husband's death, a mother and her teenage son move from Chicago to a beach town to live with the mother's estranged father so that she can make a new start.  It's like moving to a different world.  In this town, everyone surfs.  Young Jake does not.  He finds courage and strength as his grandfather teaches him.  This is a great family film for all ages.  There are some really pretty beach scenes and some awesome surfing as well.
  Our family enjoyed it.

5847255,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"The 411 by Maria:

I love family friendly movies were estranged families are brought together due to circumstances and finally find the love they were missing out on.

Jake and his mom live in Chicago but end up in a sleepy little surf town after the death of his father. Thankfully mom has a place to stay while she gets a new job and begins her new life taking care of her and her son alone. She lands in her estranged dad's house. Who is a loner who lives a quiet life, volunteering at the church and trying his best to get close to his family.

On a mission to find Wi-Fi Jake ends up at a little surf shop run by Jason Castro of American Idol fame and so it begins. A pretty girl, a jealous ex boyfriend, a new life in a small town, and a challenge to learn surfing round out Jake's new life.

A story about starting over and letting others help you and ""never living with regrets"".

Sweet story! Eric Roberts was great as grandpa and while Jake looked a bit too old to play the angsty teen, my kids and I enjoyed it.",1405382400,5,1022,4.115577889447236
5847256,4,B00DQ6S5OS,"I favour a Christian film above the usual Hollywood (sad) offerings and this is one film viewers will enjoy for not only the scenery but the heartfelt message it sends!

""The man you become tomorrow is the man you choose to be today. I can almost hear Jesus saying these words too. Let that one sink in for a while and let our every decision be made with the thought of the outcome and the future of that one decision. We reap what we sow.""

Beautiful Carolina shores are the setting of this surfing movie and cast such as Martial Arts expert Eric Roberts and American Idol Jason Castro amongst others.

Definitively a film young people will enjoy for the beach scenes if not sterling acting performances but I give it a high mark because it is not just about the younger crowd but also the adults who must face challenges and are not afraid to take a chance!

""Sometime you have to find the courage to make some waves.""

Wholesome and entertaining, this film rates 4 stars for family values!

As a surfer some of the surf scenes were painful for me to watch.  The story/dialog seemed very dramatic while the surf footage didn't come close to matching up.
