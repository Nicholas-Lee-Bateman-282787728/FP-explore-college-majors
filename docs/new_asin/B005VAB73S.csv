4897234,4,B005VAB73S,"A bit of a rough start with Montgomery overdoing the part of the nerd, but ultimately the film settles into an delightful story with fine acting and endearing characters. Good laughs, some angst, and a bittersweet but optimistic ending. It's worth a look. By the way, I'm grateful for any gay films at all, good or bad. Yes, ideally, they would all be beyond excellent, but even in mainstream films with access to much larger production budgets and a far greater pool of actors the quality may falter. Matthew Montgomery, as a producer or actor, is a superior spokesman for the gay community. The film is certainly NOT tripe.",1324684800,4,625,4.743119266055046
4897235,1,B005VAB73S,"I know that most gay movies are independent productions but why are so many of them so bad. You really have to suspend belief to believe  that anyone could find the main character, as played by Matthew Montgomery, even vaguely attractive and want to marry him. He twitches and mugs and generally displays personal characteristics that would make most of us cringe....
Just another of those gay versus the religous fundamentalist movies, not funny, not clever,badly acted and embarassing...
Hard to take gay cinema seriously when tripe like this keeps getting released. There must be better screenwriters out there than what is presented here. I refuse to believe that ""Shelter and Latter days"" are abnormalities of gay cinema...

Mathew Montgomery who is usually quite good as the ""everyman"" likeable hot but still achievable, plays a nerd so over the top that he appears mentally challenged.  The same goes with the actress the played his mother and the poor guy that played the father.  It was like they were in a cartoon, while the rest of the cast were competent actors and in a different film. I'm giving it an ok mark as the film did cover internalized Homophobia.

I'm not sure if he was going for idiot savant, lovable geek, or degenerative muscle disease victim, but whatever it was he just made a fool of himself.

This movie goes in so many wrong, clumsy directions, that it's hard to get a handle on it.  It tries to take place in some absurd realm like a John Waters film, it tries to be silly like a Pee Wee Herman film, it tries to be stumblingly funny like a Jerry Lewis film, and to be in the conventional world as well.  It does NONE of this effectively.  It is miserable.  I felt uncomfortable for the decent actors who were in this.  It was so bad that it rivals ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", except that it can't even be unintentionally funny.
And WHY in the world is there a drag queen sound track and theme throughout this film?  Take the worst drag queen portrayal you can imagine, combined with being strung-out, singing a slightly twisted version of ""Is That All There Is?"" because the producers wouldn't pay royalties to use the actual song, and you begin to get an idea of this miasma of a cheap film with little aspirations of being either cinema or parody.
I only wish that I had the time I've spent on this movie back.  Move along.  Nothing to see here.  Don't waste your time.",1331424000,15,1283,4.260330578512397
4897281,1,B005VAB73S,"What happened ? For years, I have enjoyed Matthew Montgomery as an actor. I have happily written glowing reviews of him. But, in this film he was horribly miscast and / or mis-directed. His over-acting a la Jerry Lewis and his endless facial mugging were just too much. Mind you, this whole film is a loser. The screenplay is all over the place and the film has no center. It goes off in a bunch of unsatisfying directions : romance, slapstick comedy, political, and more. Very little is believable, even when we are supposed to be serious. Most of the characters are either caricatures or downright unpleasant. The drag performer who sings the same song poorly over and over and who waxes philosophically got old in the very first minutes but then went on to be a major character in the film.

It is charming, and has gay faves Matthew Montgomery and Peter Stickles kissing a lot. But it could've definitely spent some more time in the editing room. It probably could've stood to be trimmed by about twenty minutes. It is nowhere near as bad as some people on this site are saying, though. It's just too long, and not enough time is spent on the romantic escapades of Montgomery's and Stickles's characters. And if it's eye candy you want, Dylan Vox shows up in one scene and gets naked.

4897284,3,B005VAB73S,"Playing against his usual ""type"" in gay films, Matthew Montgomery is Paul, a nerdy, fastidious gay man who has friends, a nice home, and his own ad agency, but no partner with whom to share it.  After attending a lesbian wedding, and knowing that Prop 8 was on the horizon to stop same-sex marriages, Paul embarks on a misguided, frantic journey through speed dating, meeting guys through the internet (And, no, ""FF"" does not mean he's into fly fishing!) and trying way too hard to impress.

Meanwhile, Paul's well-to-do parents had a fight, and his mother (who is more than a bit naive and recently donated a large sum of money to the Prop 8 campaign, because the kids in their commercial were cute), gets stranded for a time in a trucker's casino in the desert, where she hangs out with a drag queen.  Paul's father goes chasing after his wife, but manages to get carjacked and roans the desert without his pants.  And Paul has a big decision to make as to whether to take on a client who is involved in pushing through Prop 8.

I wish I could recommend this, as it does have its cute moments, but it is largely a muddled, overdone and unrealistic slapstick mess.  Montgomery makes the transition from unrecognizable to annoying, with exaggerated facial expressions throughout.  Director Billy Clift brings along Matthew Martin, who played the lead in his 2010 ""Baby Jane"" film, and her drag presence in this film is much overdone. Some minor sound problems and editing snafus are also evident, and this could have been a much better film if he cut about 20 minutes from its 120 minute run time, which would helpfully make it more cohesive.  As is, I can give it just three stars out of five.",1325980800,10,1694,4.604651162790698
4897285,2,B005VAB73S,"....Cause this just ain't what you think it's gonna be.

(( 2-STARS----An ""I Don't Like It"" Rating ))

So, let me be honest with you right up front here. I have NEVER been a
great fan of Matthew Montgomery. And despite 15 film roles, for me he
has never improved past the point of being an ""average"" actor. That,
and his appearance, as much as anything. There has always been
something a little bit ""Ratso Rizzo"" (for want of a kinder description)
about his facial characteristics. So there...now you know how shallow
I am.

At last...let's briefly get to the movie, itself. And by the way, it
is a film story of several subplots; in no way does it particularly
concentrate on Matthew's character and his idiotic attempts to land the
cute man of the cover. Playing an extremely unattractive Super-Geek,
the best that Montgomery can bring to the role is a
clinching...compressing...contortion of his lips and mouth (and, of
course, the supposed-to-be nerdish, black frame glasses). The mouth
exercising QUICKLY gets very old...at the same time making it quite
difficult to understand our lead. Worse, this is compounded by one of
the most terribly recorded soundtracks I have heard in years. I cannot
say enough bad about the original sound-man's work on this film....BUT,
Breaking Glass features should be especially ashamed to have their name
attached to such a poor sound release.

Finally, it may interest you that, out of the film's near 120 minute
running time, Matthew and his bride-to-be (or is it the other way
around) are TOGETHER for no more than an amazing 20 minutes of screen
time. Leaves a lot to be gotten done in those oh-so-interesting
subplots.

I'm not sure how this actor continues to get so much work, since his past dramatic performances have consistently been low-energy and lackluster, but his attempt at comedy here is a full-blown disaster.
