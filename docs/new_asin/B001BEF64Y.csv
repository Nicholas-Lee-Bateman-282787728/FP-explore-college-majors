8282946,3,B001BEF64Y,"For those of you who are not aware, Venesa Talor (Also goes by Vanessa Taylor) became famous starting from Playboy's College Girls. (I forget which issue it was) According to the magazine, at the time, she was majoring in Psychology at L.A. Pierce College, but obviously she didn't pursue that direction. At the time, she was just an unknown girl who posed for Playboy for a magazine series or 2, only to later do a lot of other nude modeling for Playboy Lingerie and various other magazines. She then got a role in Fem Alien as leading actress, a story about a female alien who has sex with males and females. She also got another role, this time in a movie called Timeless Obsession. Most of her movie roles always involved some kind of romantic, sexual, or love relationship. She did continue to do modeling for other magazines and anywhere else that would hire her.

This DVD is of her ""Pre"" Playboy days. (Probably how she was able to pay for her college) It's a movie of her posing and stripping in various areas of a home she is in. The video is obviously a remake of the VHS version of this video as the quality of the video is, although not bad, not the best. There's no talking of any kind, just general posing and stripping throughout the video. The background music is not bad, goes pretty well with what is shown in the video. She is an extremely sexy woman and had a very beautiful body. She was obviously on her way to being a model from the start and this video shows it. This video also includes another woman by the name of Denesa (DVD cover says Denisa), doing about the same thing. Both girls have about equal face time of about an hour each. (43 minutes for Venesa Talor, 55 minutes for Denesa)

If you are looking for a video that is worth the watch, this is actually not bad. Just understand the quality of the video is of about late 1990's. (VHS format) But the fact that it's about just over 90 minutes and with 2 girls is pretty good. I personally enjoyed the video, mainly because of Venesa Talor alone. I got this video in about 7 days (Standard USPS) and the price of about $10 (Plus shipping) is not bad all things considered. This is mainly for collectors, but also for anyone who enjoys the female body and Venesa Talor.",1374710400,,2252,4.398081534772182
8282947,5,B001BEF64Y,"This DVD is every bit as good as the first Vanessa Taylor DVD. She appears in several vignettes, similar to those in the first. This woman is an absolute knock out. Don't miss out on this video especially if you can get it for less than $12.",1367193600,,241,4.148936170212766
