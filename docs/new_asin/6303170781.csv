8182513,5,6303170781,"All I have to say is Jennifer Tilly is a riot in this film as the arrogant Meranda Webber who tries to create the perfect man. The way she goes about it you just won't believe. It's too bad that this film is out of print. But  if you run across it, grab it. It's a wild party on video. I love this  movie. By the way the rest of the cast is awesome too.",919209600,5,353,3.6933333333333334
