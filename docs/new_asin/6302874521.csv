Think about it: take a dump on a stock and get wiped out; now you are a messenger?  I do not think so.  I know of a few New York Stock Exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades, but this is crazy.  Thank goodness they kept the New York scenes to a minimum.  Yes, he was suppose to be at the NYSE and not the Pacific Stock Exchange as a previous reviewer wrote.",1103932800,2,466,3.956989247311828

Either way there are tasks at hand.  This movie really demonstrates certain ethics and values.  There are certain things people may do for extra money, but how far will they go.  Will they lose everything they have or will they hit it big.
Quicksilver is a great movie for the everyday dreamer.  Many people talk of the ""American Dream"".....  Well this just proves that there are steps to get there.",1045612800,2,572,4.603960396039604
522919,4,6302874521,"The movie was filmed on the floor of the san francisco OPTIONS floor exchange. All the traders stayed after the close and filmed the movie. How do I know? My dad was in this movie. He worked on the floor and has several shots of him 1) at a quotron(remember those) , and 2) clearing for some one.
So obviously I am biased, but aside from my dad this is actually a pretty decent film, save the fact that no way some ex-trader is going to get on the floor take a position and make a killing. Every once and a while I bust this movie out and watch pop in his blue brioni suit working the floor. He is my hero and I will always have this to show my kids and their kids when he is no longer with me.
So get the film!",1035504000,,711,3.8767123287671232
522920,4,6302874521,"The movie is set in an unnamed city, but I live in San Francisco, and it is obvious that the movie was shot here, even though the filmmakers tried to avoid shooting landmarks.
The Pacific Exchange is located downtown and that is probably where Bacon's character works. However, the exchange's equities floor went fully electronic in 3/2002 and there is no longer a trading floor full of traders yelling at each other. The options floor is still open.
I would recommend this film to fans of bicycle movies and maybe Kevin Bacon movies. I'm a fan of cycling movies, so I own a copy and have seen it several times. I work in an office job and used to be a pretty hardcore cyclist. I used to fantasize being a SF messenger. However, I also knew that my lifestyle required more than [their salary].
The cycling scenes are fun but there are some continuity problems. In closeups, Kevin Bacon's bicycle lacks brakes and gears, which is consistent with the fashion among many messengers to ride fixed gear/track bikes on the street. However, in many of the stunt shots, when he is racing down the hills, the stuntman cyclist is clearly on a freewheel-equipped bike and probably has brakes.
There are also several scenes shot in Kevin's massive loft apartment. It might have been possible for a messenger to have his own large loft apartment in the 80's, where he can play with his ballerina girlfriend. However, that apartment probably costs [a lot more] today!",1032998400,2,1453,4.724409448818897

There just wasn't much depth to any of the characters.  They were all too typical.  Of note is Bacon's performance which despite the characters blandness he manages to breathe some life into it.  And as always Laurence Fishburne does a credible job.

522923,3,6302874521,"I saw this film late last night on cable. I've got a feeling it might have glamorized the life of  bicycle messengers a tad. If ""Quicksilver"" was meant to inspire all the kids out there who want to be couriers, I'm doubtful that it worked.
Kevin Bacon stars as a trailblazing stockbroker (Jack Casey) who loses everything. Now he does his trailblazing in another way: he becomes a bicycle courier. His failure on the trading floor dented his confidence, and now cycling around the city, delivering messages, has become his life.
Some of the camera angles with the cycling scenes were pretty good. Did Bacon do his own stunts? The movie lacks a few things such as plot and believability, but it's fairly watchable. The best part was towards the end, when Jack was gallantly leading the ""bad guy"" away from  ""the girl"". The relentless car chase was funny.
Some of the filming was done in New York (I think) and also in San Francisco. I assumed the film was set in New York since the main character was a stockbroker. I read that the film was shot in three different cities but I don't know what the third was. Like some of the bicycle riders, the film stumbles. Overall the film was pretty lightweight, but it isn't as bad as ""The Air Up There"".",974592000,7,1243,4.52

523060,1,6302874521,"this movie was boring. it was short on dialog. it really didn't make any sense. it was if someone tried (not so hard) back in the 80s to launch the popluarity for cyclists/bike messengers. throughout the entire movie I was thinking . . . where are the place in this town (which was SF but I don't think they ever said it was SF and where people referred to part of their town like it was Manhattan and where people spoke like they were from Harlem). Anyway there were stupid car chase scenes where a car is chasing a cyclist, trying to run it down. Of course the streets are deserted. And of course there are no police to be seen. There is some violence where a woman gets roughed up. Again no police. The cyclists are riding contrary to traffic. Where are the police? I have been to SF and Manhattan many times. And everywhere you look there are people and police. So this looks staged. Kevin Bacon looked like some pedophile in the opening scenes with his mustache and slicked back hair. Then he looked like a girl with his beret on riding his bike. Then he looked like a 9 year old boy in later scenes. But he talked like, and we are supposed to be believe,  he was a rich male stock market genius. Even when he was wearing reading glasses in one scene it looked like they were trying to dress this girl/kid looking guy up into an adult. It looked fake. Pretend. And as far as the plot (if there really was one) goes . . . who loses their parents' savings and then goes and gets a less than minimum wage job? Most of us would get 3 jobs to restore our parents' savings. Not this guy. But he is supposed to be a good guy. The hero of the plot. And what kinda plot involves the hero returning to his confident ways to make money for the ""poor Mexican"" . . . not to get a restaurant but to get his life's dream of owning a hotdog stand? I mean come on. This was just a waste of time. I'm glad it was free with Amazon Prime or I would have been rather upset. And what are these people on Amazon giving this movie 3 stars about?

But to those that do, it's definitely a movie to have in your collection.  The meaning is as poignant today as it was then.  That is, the freedom you feel from riding a bicycle.  Not only the freedom to go were you want, but the freedom of life.  There is a deeper meaning in the story that has nothing to do with the stock market or the bad guy drug dealer making everyone's life miserable in the various plot lines.  These are merely side issues with respect to the main theme which is the purity of cycling.  The sound track is a custom made collection of excellent 80's era music.  There are some discrepancies in the locations.  It seems like it takes place in NYC, yet there is a bike race scene that clearly takes place in San Fransisco because they needed an impossible to pedal hill.  There is a few bike scenes that show some fixie free-stylists that are amazing.  What's cool about this movie is that you see bike frames of that era that are actually now popular frames to find at garage sales and rebuild into single-speeds, using today's hi-tech wheels and bottom brackets, etc.  It would be great if they did a re-make of this movie using the amazing bikes available today.  Kevin Bacon keeps the acting glued together throughout the whole movie.  You don't find many films that have bicycles as their main component so that alone makes this film great.",1322784000,4,1476,4.479400749063671

Then, there's are two weird cutaway shots first to the lead bicycle chick sporting an enigmatic smile, and then to Kevin without his shirt. Where are they in the cutaways? In his loft? Do those few seconds take place right after the chase scene? Does anyone remember those cutaways being longer in the original film? It just seems anticlimactic that there's no really intense romantic scene between those two before the end... other than going to the hotdog stand. Is this just me....?

523085,5,6302874521,"This is simply an antodote to the Amazon review which was obviously written by someone that wasn't paying attention if indeed they ever watched the movie.

Kevin Bacon plays a Commodities trader (big difference from a Stockbroker) that loses it all on a highly leveraged trade and even worse, loses everything his parents had entrusted him to invest.  He basically drops out and goes from the highest level of the economy to the lowest.  He buys a used bike and starts riding for a delivery service.  (I have no idea where the idea of evil bosses came into the Amazon review, the boss at the messenger service comes across as a decent guy.)  A young woman named Terri is hired and soon becomes the target of Gypsy, a drug dealer and ne'er do well that would like to enslave her as a prostitute.  Paul Rodriguez also is in the mix as an experienced courier that wants to raise enough money to buy a hot-dog cart so he can leave the courier business behind.

The drama of the movie centers around Gypsy's efforts to enslave Terri and the climax is a car/bicycle chase where Kevin Bacon outwits Gypsy and sends him plunging from an earthquake damaged bridge.  In the end, Bacon's confidence is restored and he finds an opportunity in the markets that can put him back in the game.  Calling in favors from old friends he makes the trade and wins big which allows him to get back on top, restore his parent's losses, help Terri to a better life and finance Rodriguez's new cart.

As far as Marshall Fine is concerned, let's just say that you should be a bit embarrased to have written such an innacurate review of a movie that an 12 year old could have understood but you obviously didn't.

Overall the movie is entertaining if a bit of a stretch in places.  The overall plot is feasible although the Gypsy character strains credibility a bit IMO.  At the end it's a feel good movie with a happy ending and promise of a bright future for all of the heroes.  I liked it a lot when it first came out and I've glad to see that it has found its way onto DVD.",1236038400,12,2049,4.400530503978779

523090,5,6302874521,"This movie should not be taken too seriously.  It is about a Wall Street trader in the 80s who loses it all on one big gamble and chooses to follow his passion: riding bikes.  Being a bike messenger in NYC is not lucrative, nor is it very appealing to anyone unless you really like to ride, which Bacon's character does.  So the plot, while seemingly unrealistic, is at its most basic level about throwing away the business suit and choosing to do what makes you happy, regardless of the financial costs.

The movie is great if you're a fan of cycling, especially of fixed gear cycling.  There are a number of scenes where the riders do some cool tricks, like when they are hanging out in front of the dispatch and when Bacon is in his ridiculously large warehouse loft.  If you look closely at the bikes during the impromptu 'trick show' you'll see that they are specially geared bikes (maybe, 20-16 gearing) for doing those kind of tricks.  Most of the scenes have Bacon riding a fixed gear bike, but some have him on with a freewheeler.  The final chase scene of 'Bike vs Car' is just comical, but so is most of the movie.

I think it's definitely worth watching just for an entertaining throw-back to the 80s and to see Laurence (Larry) Fishburn and Paul Rodriguez in great roles.  Highly recommended for cycling fans and anyone who's ever been or considered being a messenger!",1153440000,16,1381,4.554655870445344
523091,1,6302874521,"I'm writing because I thought Fine's review was bad.

I was interested in this movie because it has Jamie Gertz, who has proven to be a durable, dependable character actress.  Mr. Fine may or may not have talent but he is not spectacular.  Waspishness insults are passe and not becoming to a serious reviewer.  Ms. Gertz, by contrast, turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career.  I just don't know what ""untalented"" means in the context of this silly movie, but it was twenty years ago.  Is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since?  kBad form and fuzzy thinking.

I think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of Flashdance: upbeat background music, meaningless but interesting visuals, skill display, romance,  people with aspirations surviving at a humble level.  Jamie Gertz is the ""face"" girl.",1148342400,2,858,4.895833333333333

There's lots of great footage of urban cycling, even if some of it is a tad unrealistic. It's a fast-paced movie with lots of cycling action and actually has a multiple interesting plot lines, not related to cycling.",1128816000,21,512,4.626373626373627
523093,4,6302874521,"Yes, this movie is kind of unrealistic but so what. And just to re-clear up the bike thing. It wasn't a coaster brake bike like you had on your old banana seat bike when you were a kid. It's a track bike with a fixed gear. Which means the pedals spin as long as the rear wheel spins. And backward pressure slows your speed but does not completely stop it. That why he always jumped off the back and grabed the seat when he wanted to stop quickly. That is also why anyone crazy enough to ride a track bike on the street usually has a front brake installed. Look at the scenes where he is freestyling in his apartment. He is pedaling backward. This can only be done on a fixed gear. No coaster brake. If you look really closely at some of the scenes you will be able to see different bikes. Like when Bacon rides down the stairs, you can see the bike he's on has brakes. Obviously for the stunt. But I really like this movie. I've been a messenger and I always wanted the place I worked to be like that movie. We never went outside and freestyle in the street while the boom box played. And hot girls never gave me their phone number. But we get to see Lawrence Fishburne as Voodoo when was still know as Larry. And that's worth the 13 bucks right there.",1120003200,18,1252,4.156378600823046
