This is probably the best of Hogan's movies.

751249,4,6303962459,"Hulk Hogan will leave you in stitches as you watch Suburban Commando.
The Hulkster plays Shep Ramsey, an interstellar hero, who fights space villians.  His ship is damaged after a fight with an interstellar nasty and he must hide out on Earth until it can recharge. So he moves in with Christopher Lloyd's suburban family.
Christopher Lloyd plays a timid little man who is pushed around by everyone.  The Hulkster teaches his to pray, eat his vitamins, and stand up for himself.
The jokes in this flick are so funny!  I was laughing so hard that I passed out.  The scene where the car alarm is afraid of Hulk Hogan is outrageously funny.  That scene works on so many levels!  You'll lose control when you see it.  Also, the scene with the mime is uproarious!
In short, this is another Hulk Hogan masterpiece.  You have to watch it.",990403200,,831,4.5675675675675675

751489,5,6303962459,"I love this movie ever since I was a child. Hulk Hogan has been my favorite wrestler ever since I was a child. This movie is so hiliarious. This film takes place after Shep Ramesy (Hogan), an intergalactic warrior had defeated an evil dictator (Ball) and crash lands on Earth. Charlie Wilcox (Lloyd) is having a bad day due to an annoying set of light signals, bad neighbors, a greedy boss, and his work shop turned to a rented apartment. Ramesy has to blend in with the Earthlings which he hates. He rents the apartment from the Wilcox home which Wilcox is against it. That night, Wilcox spied on Ramesy, followed him to his ship, messed with his equipment, and the battle begins due to bank robbers, bounty hunters, (one of them is played by Mark Calloway aka Undertaker) and an old enemy returns from the dead. I gave this Hogan film 5 stars and I highly recommended it.",1435795200,,873,4.49685534591195

If you try to enjoy this film objectively, forget about it. If you don't particularly like Hulk Hogan, don't waste your time! But, if neither is the case, there's a lot to love in this film. I first watched it in the theater, and now sharing it with my son (who likes the Hulk and The Undertaker). There are some moments that are SO BAD you'll groan, but how can you not laugh and have a good time? The cast obviously saw it that way--no one can possibly take this script seriously, so why not go over the top with it? I love it. I watch serious films and understand fancy terms like a double entendre and multi-layered plots. But there are none here!

751634,5,6303962459,"I love this movie. Like the famous commercial for Gillette Right Guard deodorant (""Anything else would be uncivilized!""), it shows Hulk Hogan's sweet side. I recently read the final chapters of Hogan's biography, ""My Life Outside the Ring,"" and found my suspicions about his real nature were delightfully confirmed. After a very difficult life involving a painful marriage, divorce, lawsuit, and vilification by a drooling press (CNN played an especially nasty role), the Hulkster emerged with a new, positive attitude - his inner goodness triumphed. It's an impressive, inspiring book, by the way. Where was I? Oh yes, Suburban Commando shows the funny, irrepressibly upbeat, life-loving side of Hogan. Whether he's rescuing a kitten from a tree, dealing with white-trash neighbors and their boat, or fighting interspace bounty hunters, it's all done with humor and a wonderfully cheerful, tongue-in-cheek spirit. A classic of the big guy as likeable nice guy genre (e.g., Arnold's ""Kindergarten Copy"").",1322956800,,1004,5.483870967741935

There, Ramsey begrudgingly makes friends with a couple(Lloyd and Duvall)and their two kids. While on Earth, Shep comically learning the Earth cultures and customs. Suburban Commando also has an appearance by WWE wresling star The Undertaker, as one of Ramsey's arch-villains.

The acting is a little hammy, but I still found this a fun hour and a half. I'm always glad to see light entertainment and Christopher Lloyd and Hulk Hogan are definitely a good match up in this comedy. When an architect and his family are hurting for money they rent out a room. Little do they know the man that rents it is a space mercenary with good causes and a special resentment towards humans.

Shep becomes angry and smashes the dashboard, inadvertently damaging his ship and causing him to make an emergency landing on our little Earth, (Shep's not so favorite planet), for repairs.

The showdown between Shep and the bounty hunters is the best part, especially when we find out why they're always so mum. ""No wonder you guys never talk!""

If you look at the reviews, you'll see that the only bad ones come from stuffy, crotchety old adults.  There isn't a single kid in the known universe who won't like this movie.  Kids know this movie is cool!  If you want something to entertain a party of kids, this is it.

This is my fav movie that Hogan has made. It kind of spoofs Star Wars in a way in the begining. I kind of describe the movie as ""what if someone from Star Wars came to Earth for a vacation?""
Hogan plays a space warrior who is informed to take a vacation after a battle. He comes to Earth to recharge his ship and blend in for a little while, he gets to know the locals, and becomes almost part of Charlie Wilcocks family (Christopher Lyodd) while beeing persued by a couple of intergalctic bounty hunters. One of which is Mark Calaway , a wrestler known as The Undertaker. Also starring Shelly Deval, and the funny Larry Miller. This is a fammily action/comedy movie. So if your into a pure action movie, give this one a skip. But if you want a movie of this calibur, then check it out, its a great price for such a DVD.... tho im disapointed that it dosent come with any Deleted Scenes, or any bonus features apart from a trailer and a game where you see a picture and then guess which movie it is from, and try to get 10 out of 10.... its a great deal on a pretty good movie! Only Hogan haters, or people expecting it to be more adult will say bad things about it i think? It has some great laughs for a fammily night in.",1083715200,,1497,4.13013698630137

It's about a man named Shep Ramsey who is a humaniod and hates earthlings.  His ship crahses on earth, so he takes a vavcation.  Soon, he moves in with a man played by Christopher Lloyd who is extremly smart, but gets pushed around by his boss, his neighbors, an old lady in a sports car, and anyone he meets.  So, Shep moves in and then bounty hunters come and take over the world.  Or try to.  Shep and (Christopher Lloyd's charecter name here) stop them and the earth is svaed.
  This movie is hilarious, awesome and cool.  The action is non-stop all the way from beginning to end.  The sci-fi speical effects ,well, hey cut them a break, for 1991 they were soooo cool.  And constant expolsions.  And the comedy is hilarious.  My favorite gag was the car alarm gag.
Car alarm: step away from the vechile
