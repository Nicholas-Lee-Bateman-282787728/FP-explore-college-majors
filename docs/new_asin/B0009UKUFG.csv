Mr. Williams is not only obviously an expert on the subject but does a beautiful, thoughtful narration.
I have shared the dvd with friends and we all agree it is wonderful, entertaing and VERY informative.
I especially like the quality of picture and sound.
I am told that the travel producers don't use Hollywood standards but to my eye and mind this is on a par with any Hollywood spectacle I have in my collection!
If there were more than 5 stars this would get 10!!",1208390400,3,522,4.336734693877551
