6332500,5,B00J3QIAZE,"Two of Bogarts classics.  Filled with great directing, acting, and drama.  Excellent quality and service.",1477353600,,105,5.933333333333334
6332501,4,B00J3QIAZE,Sierra Madre was difficult to watch because something in the way Bogart acted makes you feel uncomfortable.  I assume they want you to feel something but all I could feel was that Bogart is not the best actor in the world.  It could be the writing or directing too.  Maltese Falcon was better but still something was off.  Not sure if it was the writing or Bogart's acting.  To be clear though I don't even think Bogart's acting was good Casablanca.  His lack of expression of any kind maybe.  Actually I did like the creepy Peter Lorre though.  The quality of the film to dvd was good.,1476835200,2,586,4.411214953271028

6332527,4,B00J3QIAZE,"Two of Bogart's best. In the Maltese Falcon Bogart plays detective Sam Spade trying to unravel the mystery of his partner's death while wooing the client. A decent mystery well told.
Treasure of Sierra Madre has Bogart as Fred Dobbs as we watch greed take a toll on him.
Both movies are well acted and well directed. Both movies include the Warner Night at the Movies option. This allows you to experience what it would have been like to go to a theater to watch these movies. You get to see coming attractions, an old newsreel, a cartoon, and a comedy short before the movies start.",1427414400,8,583,4.509433962264151

What the hell???----How could you NOT have seen these before? Two of THE BEST of Bogart's excellent movies. Why even watch the crap that they spew out into modern theaters, if you can lie down on the couch and watch Bogart??",1427155200,3,365,4.71875
6332530,5,B00J3QIAZE,"Two classics of American film for under $10? Yes, please! You can read content reviews in many places, but if you are a fan of this age of big film studios you are already familiar with these films. These are both wonderful in every way.

6332533,5,B00J3QIAZE,"TWO OF BOGART'S BEST. WORTHY OF THE ACADEMY IN BOTH FILMS. THE BEST WAY TO SEE HIS DIVERSITY. THE MALTESE FALCON WAS THE CLASSIC DETECTECTIVE MOVIE. BOGIES'S POTRAYAL OF SAM SPADE FOLLOWED THE BOOK AND SHOWED HOW IT SHOULD BE PLAYED. LORRE AND GREENSTREET WERE CLASSIC, I BELIEVE GREENSTREET DID WIN THE AWARD FOR HIS POTRAYAL OF GUTMAN, THE FATMAN. VERY ENTERTAINING WITH MANY CLASSIC ACTING THROUGHOUT. IT MADE THE BOOK REAL.IT ALSO MADE ME A DEVOTEE OF BOGART. UNTIL THIS MOVIE HE WAS ALWAYS A BAD GUY AND A THUG. HIS ROLE AND DEGRADATION AS BOGGS IN THE TREASURE WAS PERFECT, HE DID THE ROLE WITH CLASSIC APLOMB",1424390400,3,615,4.651376146788991
