8008929,1,B00019U9VA,"I received this workout video by mistake, so the seller let me keep it for free, and I decided to try it out.  I'm an intermediate exerciser, and have a huge library of videos.  Please, do yourself a favor, and do not buy this video.  It's kind of ridiculous - the video features several people working out to a blown up punching bag that stands upright - looking like a gigantic phallic symbol.  The punching bag has no function other than to promote itself and make Billy Blanks money.  I can't decide if I should throw the video out, or donate it to Goodwill - it's just that awful.",1456012800,,585,4.330275229357798
8008930,4,B00019U9VA,"You need a standing bag or ""billy bob"". You can just pretend and hit the air but not the same effect on your muscles. It should have been stated in the description that the video required extra equipment",1424563200,,203,4.368421052631579

8008932,4,B00019U9VA,"CALORIE BURN:  I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn which also allows me to measure how many calories I burn during a specific workout, as well as how many I burn per minute during the workout. I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific  measurement rather than perceived exertion. First, you'll actually get a better workout without the optional punching bag (and I'll get to that in a minute) but it ranked high on calories burned in comparison to many of the fitness dvds I own (and I own way more than I should.)

TONING: THIS ONE IS GREAT FOR YOUR ABS TOO! The beauty of Tae Bo is that you get cardio combined with toning. The sheer act of kicking and punching elevates your heart in any workout, but Billy Blanks, in my opinion, really has worked his moves out to a great science (I do own several of his in addition to several other kickboxing, tae bo, etc workouts).  For example, this is an excellent ab workout due to the twists and moves created to engage your obliques. You'll feel it the next day and you'll get results.

PUNCHING BAG/ SPEED BAG: Did you ever have one of those blow up clowns when you were a kid that had a weighted bottom and it was really, really lightweight because it was merely full of air and you could hit it and it would wobble back? If you still have it, there is no need to buy the optional punching bag from the order form included in this dvd. In fact, there is simply no need for it as it will only slow down your results. If one was using an actual punching bag, the heavy weight of it creates resistance which results in both better strength and caloric burn during punches.  However, you'll notice in this video they advise you to barely hit the punching bag, should you buy it, because if you do it will fly foreward and punch you in the face upon its return. (Because it's just air filled, with the bottom weighted with water. It stands on the floor and wobbles back and forth.) Therefore, you soften your punches and kicks which doesn't give you as good of results as simply punching the air as you normally do in Tae Bo.  I've done it with bag and without bag. I had better results without bag. Just ignore the punching bags in the video and do what they do without the punching bags. If you order the bag it doesn't look nearly as nice as the ones in the video anyway.

INSTRUCTION: I have several of Billy Blanks' dvds for a reason...he has great energy and always has exceptional workouts that scorch calories and tone well. I happen to love the counting down he does because it enables you to know you are to tempo and not have to stare at the tv the whole time if desired. It's also energizing.  His cueing is excellent as even a beginner would never miss a step.  I like that he provides a studio that's full of people. Keeps it interesting for me.

LEVEL: There are no weights in this. Tae Bo is inherently designed that if you know how to kick and punch, you can do it.  You'll burn calories and firm up even if you workout daily. I feel this one even though I workout often but if I go for weeks without a workout I can still jump in do it.  I also ordered weighted gloves for when I really want to amp up my arm toning and burn.

LENGTH: 44 minutes. But even a 20 minute workout with this one is good.

SET: A very nice studio, full of people so there's many to follow and it's visually interesting.

ENERGY: Due to the instruction and team, it's through the roof.

NEGATIVES: The speed bag was a gimmick that fell flat, and someone needs to throw Billy a towel. Even in other workouts when no one else sweats the poor guy is soaked from the get go. He's just a natural sweater...it drips down to the floor. EEEESH.  They must have been shooting this dvd all day because in this one, everyone is dripping wet even when I'm not...I want to call in a towel service...but that's just me.  :-)  He's such a dang good instructor that I ignore it.

ALTERNATIVES: These are some other workouts I like with similar results:

The Firm: Pump, Jump, n Jab
Billy Blanks': Tae Bo Extreme
Jillian Michaels: The Biggest Winner Cardio Kickbox
10 Minute Solution: Knockout Body
Billy Blanks: Tae Bo Circuit 1

CONCLUSION: I have a full library of fitness dvds and this remains a favorite.",1261094400,7,4273,4.327067669172933
8008933,3,B00019U9VA,The Video is a decent work out however if you don't have the Standing Punching Bag you will be out of luck like me and punching and Kicking in the air. But I still sweated during the work out and my metabolism was up so I guess that's the goal.,1256169600,3,244,3.9
8008934,2,B00019U9VA,"It's about 44 minutes long and 40 of them you are punching or doing butterflies.  There is no real cardio movement. Just, punch and more punch to an airbag that you can even punch hard because; as might as well just use a hanging balloon.
I am used too the extreme, ultimate, the best of, cardio work outs by Billy Blank but this one was just too slow for me.  I wish someone would of rate it before I bought it.",1189036800,7,412,4.074074074074074
