8602241,1,B0008IUBTY,"Digitally remastered?  Hah!  This is a very poorly produced DVD from what looks like an edited TV broadcast.  The running length of the DVD is about 80 minutes, with the full-length movie coming in at 102 minutes.  Watching the original credits, part of the lettering of names is off-screen.  Picture quality is abysmal.  The quality is so bad I didn't even both watching the DVD.",1505260800,,380,4.769230769230769
8602242,5,B0008IUBTY,"The film itself, while not a great cinematic experience, does have nostalgic value to this (young) man. I found this movie on late night cable many years ago. Would only recommend to those who know what to expect from a mid 1970s sex comedy. Then lower those expectations. I don't believe it to be a sequel to the 1966 film. As far the tape itself, it arrived well in advance of the date and in better condition than I thought. would definitely purchase from again. Thank you.",1398643200,,476,4.482758620689655
