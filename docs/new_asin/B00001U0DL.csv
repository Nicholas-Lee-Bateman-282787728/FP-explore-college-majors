7914983,5,B00001U0DL,"I watched this movie just because there was nothing else on TV worth watching. I really had no clue about it, not much info online either. But as i watched it, it just drew me in. After awhile, I was hooked...bad. This movie has a bunch of wild characters and is edited completely out of continuity; so for most of the time, you don't know what's going on, or what just happend. But it keeps jumping in time enough for you to not get lost. By the time it gets to the end, you are amazed at what you just saw. I LOVE movies like this, because it keeps you guessing. There are no big stars for you think everything is going to work out. That is why there is so much suspense...right to the end. Granted the subject matter is not for everyone, but if you are an open-minded film buff, I think you will find this quite an amazing movie. If I had made this movie, I would be proud of it.",1427932800,,882,4.074712643678161
7914984,4,B00001U0DL,"I'm a big fan of Joanna Going and like to see her in everything she acts in.  This was not my favorite film of hers, but definitely watchable and one that may appeal to others more than me.",1380672000,,189,3.973684210526316
7914985,4,B00001U0DL,"'Heaven' reminds me of the best parts of 'The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover' combined with the cinematography of anything out of the best of Antonioni...add to the mix a narrative as creative and compelling as 'Memento' and this is a 4 1/2 star film...by my rating a 5 is a film for all time (e.g. Cassablanca) 'Heaven' may well hold up in time; but, it is at least as good as anything in the last 10 years.",1007683200,6,415,4.135802469135802
7914986,4,B00001U0DL,"If you are a Richard Schiff fan, you have to get this movie and you won't be sorry if you do. The character (Stanner) he plays in this movie is so opposite of his performance as Toby Ziegler on ``West Wing'' that you have to see it to believe it! Stanner is both despicable and immensely enjoyable to watch.
Stanner is the owner of a transvestite strip joint and he's not very good to his ``girls.'' One of his dancers, who calls herself Heaven, can see flashes of the future. She helps Stanner win his poker games but eventually turns on him when a friend of his, played my Martin Donovan, helps her. She gives Martin the knowledge he needs to win a big game.
The movie is very violent and has lots of backstabbing and double crossing going on. Still, it's fascinating to watch.
Richard Schiff, as Stanner, chuckles constantly but he seems to be the only one who gets the joke. He can also be unbelievably cruel and twisted. Richard's performance is amazing to watch. There's a great scene where he tells Martin's character about the plot of a movie he thinks should be made. It's called ``Chairman of the Board'' and his description is priceless.
If you can handle the violence, the movie is well worth the price.",969840000,8,1215,4.502262443438914
7914987,4,B00001U0DL,"There are a lot of violent characters that commit some very violent acts  in this film, including rape, arson, murder and kidnapping. I mention this  first because many filmgoers have limited tolerance for this much violence.  It is a New Zealand film so the violence didn't surprise me.  The films  I've seen from that country have all been very violent.  Nonetheless, the  film has a very good plot involving a transsexual, a man who should have  been born a woman, named Heaven, who can see the future, mostly when she is  not conscious.

She and the other lead character, a compulsive gambler  played by Martin Donovan, are two people who live on the fringes of society  and are perpetually victimized. They come to each other's aid in the movie  in very inventive fashions, including Heaven's being able to see a certain  card game unfold.  There are lots of time shifts that are potentially  confusing in watching the plot unfold.  You will either find them vexing or  inventive.  I found them inventive and was not confused.  All in all, I  thought it was very good.

7914988,2,B00001U0DL,"A divorced architect (Martin Donovan), while designing a strip club for a sleazy client (Richard Schiff), gets involved in a seedy underworld which includes a transvestite stripper with extra sensory perception, a strip  club's bouncer called ""The Sweeper,"" and two sadistic thugs the  client hires for a nefarious deed. If that wasn't enough, the architect's  ""normal"" life is populated with a vindictive wife, a perverted  psychiatrist and a betraying family lawyer.
Slick, well-made thriller  which curiously (for reasons I can't quite place) feels more like a  sophisticated made-for-TV film than a theatrical release. Though produced  in 1998, this latest film from New Zealand director Scott Reynolds had a  very limited run in the states in 1999. It's a pity because the film  probably would have found an audience.
It relies a bit too much on  flash-forwards and flash-backs as the inventive building block for telling  its story and the device grows somewhat tiresome before the end. And if you  look hard enough, you may even notice that hidden inside the slickness of  the execution is a pretty conventional thriller, but with a prescient  transvestite thrown in for good measure. It's definitely worth a look.",958262400,5,1221,5.22680412371134
7914989,5,B00001U0DL,"This is a not to be missed opportunity to see Karl Urban in action.  Famous for his roles of Cupid and Caesar on syndicated TV shows around the world, Karl lives up to his reputation as a chameleon in this movie.  He  plays a bouncer known as The Sweeper.  Those who are familiar with his TV  work will be shocked to learn why he is called that by the end of the  movie.  While he was in very few of the scenes, he stole everything but the  cameras; putting in the only noteworthy performance of the entire cast.  Viewers familiar with his previous work will wonder how long he had to  train for the fight scenes and how many takes were needed to get them just  right.  He moves so quickly and smoothly you would swear this was his  regular job. The dialog is riddled with curses as if the main players were  still in their juvenile delinquent ages rather than adults.  Urban's lines  are a pleasant diversion from the rest of the film with perhaps one single  exception throughout. The movie is dark due largely to it being filmed  mostly at night.  But also because the plot is a dark one.  While the movie  does jump from one perspective to another going from premonitions to the  present and finally at the end to an actual memory, the plot is relatively  easy to follow.  A basic arson plan gone terribly awry. The movie is closed  captioned which is also a plus for those viewers who like dark dramas but  can't enjoy them in theatres due to hearing impairments such as myself. Not  for children or those squeamish about viewing rape scenes as there are at  least two, I still recommend this movie if only for Karl Urban's standout  performance.  He is young and popular and I, for one, will be waiting  impatiently for more of his work to be released on video in the near  future.",945216000,14,1787,4.386503067484663
