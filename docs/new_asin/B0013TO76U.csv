8252815,3,B0013TO76U,"Simple still puctures and a dive video, no talking so there is no info shared. Like watching a home movie from somebody's vacation.",1402704000,,131,4.739130434782608
8252816,2,B0013TO76U,"My husband and I love to snorkel and really wanted to like this - it is a decent ""home movie,"" and is about that interesting.  There are some beautiful shots of beaches, a ""Waikiki Sunset,"" but overall, it was boring and a bit overpriced at $1.99.  A book would be a better investment I'm sorry to say.",1299369600,,302,4.280701754385965
