8264337,5,B0016ZPGSY,"Ted Turner, the billionaire icon, is a much more thoughtful man than his success in the business world would indicate. Though he continues with various business projects, his mind these days seems more focused on good ideas that will 'save the world'. In this interview, a classic for the ages, he discusses issues like nuclear energy, population control and environmental protection, in a language that you will find not only accessible, but also engaging and even loveable. Ted is more than a very rich man; he is a very thoughtful human being.",1250380800,,546,4.945652173913044
8264338,5,B0016ZPGSY,"Turner is a tremendously interesting innovative and ambitious person. He has great personal charm, and his rapport with another good ole Southern boy, Charlie Rose is terrific on this show. Turner in the show reveals his plans for saving the world. He rightly points out the great danger of nuclear weapons, and of the need to drastically reduce them. But his solution is simplistic as it is often in many of the problems he deals with. He is over- critical of the United States, and at one point Charlie Rose clashes with him on his derisive tone and talk about the United States effort in Iraq. Turner also talks about his own personal business and the great achievement of his life in creating CNN and his major mistake in selling out to Time- Warner. He talks about the failure of his marriages about which he has a very human tone of regret, and expresses pride in his children and family. He is a most humane figure and appealing when he sings for Charlie Rose a few popular songs including 'My Ole Kentucky Home'. His ambitions and good intentions seem unlimited but with them comes a bit of the arrogance of the person who believes he knows and gets it all in areas he really knows little about. Nonetheless this was a great show with an enormously winning personality.",1207958400,,1277,4.605263157894737
8264339,5,B0016ZPGSY,"I watched the entire hour of conversation of Charlie with Ted Turner and I feel absolutely impressed and happy to learn that there are people in this world, successful and smart as he has been, that think (same as I do) the way he does.
Everyone should listen to his remarks, even thought you may don't want to buy the program, you can still watch it any time at Charlie's web site.",1207094400,,382,4.319444444444445
