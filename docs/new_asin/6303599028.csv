7852568,3,6303599028,"This seems to start out like your average Mexican working class comedy, initially centered on the titular Quinto Patio (Fifth Courtyard) - at least, I think..? My Spanish is kind of weak. But that doesn't keep me from enjoying films like this. ANYway...

The story soon settles down on the day-to-day travails of young up-&-comer Ramon (played by the late Manuel Lopez Ochoa), who falls in love with his boss's mistress/secretary (Jacqueline Andere). There are further complications involving embezzled money and a showdown over a game of billiards.

All of this moves along at a brisk clip under the firm, competent hand of veteran helmer Federico Curiel, who was better known for luchadore and horror films, like ""The Mummies of Guanajuato,"" ""Hellish Spiders"" and ""Santo vs. The Vice Mafia."" For all I know, this may have been Curiel's one prestige project, a change of pace that he maybe hoped would extract him from the genre ghetto. Based on his subsequent career, I don't think it worked.

The film is filled with classic '70s detailing of costume and production design, from scimitar-sized sideburns, the women's short-short skirts, Nehru jackets (worn with turtlenecks!) to a hot pink Mustang and 'psychedelic' club scenes. The movie's worth seeing for this stuff alone.",1347062400,,1278,5.134615384615385
