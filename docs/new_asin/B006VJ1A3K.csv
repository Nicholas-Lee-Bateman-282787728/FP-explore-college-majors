5020635,2,B006VJ1A3K,"I'll get right down to the basics. The film was well shot, with good editing, sound, and special effects (not over the top, but used judiciously, which is rare in vey low budget, straight to video horror these days). The acting was as might be expected - stilted, and delivered by less experienced actors who have yet to get the feel for delivering their lines, for the most part (lead actor Josh Folan, for example, stood apart from the rest of the cast in delivering believable lines, as did the actor playing the Scottish show host). The real drawback to this video was the screenwriting, and this is the real Achilles' Heel. The writer (or writers) included myriad lines in this film that really stood out as just terrible screenwriting (which prove especially harmful to the actors trying to do their jobs). Many lines are painfully overdramatic and they thus pull the viewer away from the film, like a splash of cold water, and you are forced to remember you're just watching a movie - and that's the worst thing I think any screenwriter can do. Despite this, the film, by and large, is actually better than most of its kin, and worth watching once.",1341964800,,1155,4.639024390243902

5020637,5,B006VJ1A3K,"I must say that this movie is underrated. Yes, it isn't perfect and has many flaws, but what do you expect for a small-budgeted film? Don't dismiss it for those flaws 'cause it's still an interesting horror movie, especially if you like ghosts like me.

It starts with a reality paranormal team. They find very plausible, scientific explanations for seemly supernatural activities. We learn that they want to make the paranormal a legit science where ghosts and apparitions are explained by electromagnetic fields interfering with our brains. They will do this by proving that a particular ghost hasn't died in the place, it haunts and therefore must be formed by the human brain. Thus proving that life after death doesn't exist.

They get a job in one of the most notorious haunted places in the US which is their big shot. But they're not alone: A very Christian team of believers is also there to prove the opposite.

I've always hated horror movies that doesn't really show anything supernatural. This movie isn't afraid to show us the different ghosts and that's what I really like about it. In the end the whole story goes too far and gets a bit confusing, but until then it's very good.

The story especially is very interesting. It may not be anything new, but the characters mostly seem real and some of them we actually like. This is already more than we can say about most horror movies nowadays.

If you're a horror buff who particularly likes the ghost genre, you shouldn't hesitate to watch it!",1339804800,,1509,4.744274809160306
5020638,2,B006VJ1A3K,"Episode 50 had the potential to be an awesome movie - but it isn't.  And why not?  It's because the filmmakers made numerous bad decisions along the way.  Bad editing, confusing premises, grossly inaccurate set design.  Heck, these filmmakers can't even figure out the frame of reference for the dadgummed cameras.  I'm willing to bet these filmmakers couldn't tell you what POV means if you looked it up in the dictionary for them.  The whole movie's just a complete mess.

So here's the setup.  The Paranormal Investigators team, up-and-coming reality TV ghost hunters, finally gets the chance to investigate the proverbial ""gateway to hell"" but something goes horribly wrong.  Not only is their super-hyped 50th episode never aired, their show is summarily cancelled - and no one knows why.  Until now, that is.  So we've got another entry in the ""found footage"" genre, right?  Well, yes and no.  Some of the footage comes from the team's cameras - but most of it comes from normal third person camera work.  This does not work at all, especially since it's not always clear just who is doing the filming in a particular scene.  What kind of neophyte director lays out a ""found footage"" plot and then proceeds to film everything like a normal movie?  Joe and Tess Smalley, that's who.  They further exacerbate this mistake in judgment by throwing in lots of quick shots of cheesy, ""scary"" CGI ghosts doing things in places where no characters or surveillance cameras are located.

The P.I. team is a little unusual, as they go into investigations trying to debunk any supernatural explanations.  Their logic never made a heck of a lot of sense to me: they don't believe in ghosts or spirits, yet they are trying to prove that the paranormal is real and deserving of scientific study.  Presumably, they believe that things that go bump in the night do exist, but they're just some kind of weird electromagnetic phenomenon or something - certainly nothing related to those who have died or to the demonic.  Ironically, they are surprised to find themselves sharing this investigation with a completely opposite yet equally confused team of investigators.  Let's just call them ""Team Jesus"" because their main objective is to find and exorcise demons; they apparently do believe in ghosts, although their logic for doing so escapes me - and they employ a medium.  As for how both investigative teams ended up there together, let's not even go there because it's an incredibly flimsy premise.

Let's talk about the investigation site for a minute - the West Virginia Lunatic Asylum.  The writers make up the history of the place, but it's obviously based on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virginia.  As their made-up history goes, no one has been allowed inside the place for years, not since several homeless people sought shelter in the abandoned buildings and died of fright.  Strangely enough, though, the place our two ghost hunting teams investigate is remarkably neat and clean - no dirt, no dust, no cobwebs, nothing.  It's a far cry from the real Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum.  The place is remarkably well-lit, as well; given all the light coming in from the windows, there must have been one heck of a full moon the night of this investigation.

All of the mistakes and bad judgment calls wouldn't be so bad if the storyline actually held together.  The movie jumps around like a kid playing hop-scotch, including plenty of interview clips thrown in willy-nilly to mix things up even more (it's not always obvious when a given clip was shot).  Then what I think anyone would consider to be an incredibly crucial scene is quickly passed over with very little explanation.  Finally, as we approach our disappointingly cheesy ending, all vestiges of realism are thrown to the winds.  It's like some entirely new director took over the film in those final moments to make sure that absolutely no one could possibly enjoy the viewing experience.",1339545600,,3972,4.923308270676691
5020639,1,B006VJ1A3K,"Terrible. Premise is interersting, but the movie is just terrible. Some really bad acting - especially noticeable when one of the female actors has to so very obviously turn to look at cue cards apparently.  I get the impression this film was made by some church group trying to evangelize because of the over-the-top ""believer vs non-believer"" thread to seems to be the main message of this film.  The end scene especially is soooo bad.

Special effects are ok, but very minimal. If there was suspense, one could look past this, but the the plot and characters are far too weak to make up for it.

I wouldn't waste the time unless you just have to see every ghost story made. I wish I had skipped this one.",1338681600,,707,4.5
5020640,4,B006VJ1A3K,"the movie wasn't as bad as i expected, but it is still a bit cheesey. i would only reccomend this movie if you like horror movies and if you have a lot of extra time to kill.",1338422400,3,174,3.72972972972973
5020641,4,B006VJ1A3K,"I had the good fortune of getting a copy of this movie on DVD. Although it's straight up B Movie - I only say that as a compliment. I have seen hundreds of scary ghost stories. But of late, I really haven't been scared in the movies. I thought the Hollywood grist over the last couple of years has been stale.

Sometimes you need to search out good films that go straight to video. That's how I discovered one of my favorite directors, Miike, from Japan, as well as the dozens of great straight to video movies from Japan. In Japan, it's actually a really big market and these smaller films hold great acclaim.

So too should Episode 50.

You will be scared.

I wouldn't give this film five stars though because that's reserved for classics, like The Omen or The Exorcist. Also, some of the acting was schlocky. But that's part of the fun in B movies. You aren't looking for the next Lawrence Olivier. I do think that the part played by the actor who was the lawyer was what the film needed more. It felt like the average age of the actors was about 24. Especially with the ""expert"" interviews, the roles should have been played by older people. Anyways, it's a small criticism and one that can easily be over looked since the effects are great.

If only those ghost hunter shows caught 1/100th of the footage that this film has.

So this may not be a classic but it's definitely worth $2.99. Honestly, I wouldn't want to watch it home, at night, alone.

Have fun!",1336003200,,1464,4.4

5020643,1,B006VJ1A3K,"In short, this is one of the most clumsily written, acted and directed movie I have ever seen.  The plot could have been written for a young adult church group, which is not just to say that it has some sort of Christian message (that would not be an issue), but that it could only appeal to someone whose view of spirituality spins on the axis of American non-denominationalism.  The result is a horror movie that fails in every respect with the added embarrassment of being preachy and generally idiotic.

Here, I'll spoil the story for you.  A team of television ghost hunters are called by a man of extreme wealth who was released from prison (charges unmentioned) as he is due for his imminent death from pancreatic cancer.  He also happens to be the owner of a closed asylum for the insane which is purported to be haunted by some vicious, murderous spirits. The deal is that they get one weekend with the asylum for their 50th episode (hence the name - see what they did?). Why?  The man has lived a pretty horrendous life, as he says ""I have broken every one of God's ten commandments"".  He wants to know if the asylum is haunted because if it is, that somehow means he will spend eternity burning in Hell.  Enter our psuedo-anti-hero, a man of broken faith who runs the aforementioned group of television ghost hunters with his childhood friend, an annoying man of ambiguous Latin descent and the token pretty girl.  The team is well established as using the powers of reason and observation to debunk spiritual encounters, so it seems the rich man is really hoping to clear his mind when they come back with a rational explanation for the hauntings.  The catch to all of this  is that they have to work with a team of rival, faith-based investigators... for some reason.  Personal conflict ensues while the characters all prepare for a night of ""investigating"".  Throughout an unspecified amount of time, horrible special effects are caught on high-definition cameras with cheesy filters applied.  The nonsensical plot devices continue until the full story is revealed in one anti-climactic scene (last chance, here be real spoilers).  An inmate who had been brought in for the astonishing crime of raping and killing 7 women had killed his 8th victim while in the asylum - the nurse who is briefly alluded to in the beginning and then poorly animated later on when she pops into view for cheap scares.  The kicker?  He was murdering as a part of some undefined Satanic ritual (I kid you not) and by invoking him during the investigation, they allowed him to take his 9th victim in the young psychic from the rival investigation team.  Now a portal to Hell can open and... I dunno.  I'm sure if I went to my local mega-church more, I would be indoctrinated with all sorts of silly ideas about what will happen when those pesky Satanists open portals to Hell.  In this movie, however, all that happens is that the now demon-ghost-ex-murderer stands in front of a burning, inverted pentagram with horns sticking out of his forehead until our anti-hero regains his faith and dispels the demon with a cross and incantation.  All the while - even while the young psychic gets her neck snapped and one of the other investigators gets gored, the idiotic camera men follow the investigators around like loyal puppies, never once flinching at the horrors around them.  In the end, of course, our anti-hero dies, along with the lead investigator from the rival team, and enough footage makes its way to the wealthy ex-con, who sobs quietly while we take in the movie's message: repent, or burn in Hell.

Oh yeah, and the crazy, Satanic inmate? He died of AIDS.  Hey, if it's important enough for the movie to point out, it's important enough for my review.  Why they made a point of it I will leave to your speculation.

Sadly, with a production budget several magnitudes higher than some other, decent independent horror movies, the writer/directors seemed to care more about their preaching than creating something worth watching.  It seems like the actors didn't even try in most parts, though I can't honestly expect them to fulfill the superhuman task of delivering such poorly written dialog with any degree of emotion or realism.  There was no atmosphere to the movie and all of the ghosty things popped out of the screen like Halloween decorations.  It was as though the director has never even had a nightmare, but tried to appeal to what they think ""the kids"" will think is scary.  The camera work is, I think, supposed to be from the 2nd person point of view that is outrageously popular in Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters and others.  However, it switches awkwardly at times without explanation and what we end up with is confusing and disingenuous.  It did not work in the Doom movie, it does not work here.  Stay in one perspective, directors, or at least justify the change very, very well!

All in all, I am actually upset that I watched this movie.  I'm glad that I only rented it, but I have to forever live with the fact that I gave these people a portion of money that I earned honestly.  The best that I can hope for at this point is to post this review around and hope that I can save others from the same fate.

My favorite line, ""A portal has to open on a Satanic symbol, like an inverted pentagram or something, right?"".  Yeah, sure.  Makes sense.",1334966400,15,5378,4.6687898089171975
5020644,2,B006VJ1A3K,"This is most likely one of those movies that claimed it really happened.... pffft, yeah right.

To get an idea of what this movie is... think of it this way; take one of those stupid ghost hunter shows, and it suddenly gets cancelled because something bad happened in filming what has become the last episode they would ever do.

So these guys have a show just like it, and have done 49 episodes where they could explain everything they have investigated as natural occurrences, not paranormal activity. They then get asked to investigate a place that used to be a war hospital, then a  lunatic asylum and it's built on a burial ground, yadda-yadda-yadda... so the team goes in and finds that they may not be able to debunk this one as just being faulty wiring and gusts of wind.

For a while it takes you on a bit of a cool ride, but it's interrupted too often by absolute BS and stupid dialog of things the audience couldn't care less about... like these guys childhood secret... oh, how grand the reveal of that was. It also went in a stupid Christian/Catholic direction at the end that really put me off the ending. If I wanted to see BS from bad actors who make crap up for film and then pray, i'd watch ""Paranormal State"" and see what fairy-tale they are filming up this week. In this movie, it killed the whole tone.

The only good thing about the ending I liked was that it took a different turn than most other films like this, and actually left the Asylum to track down another place where something else is happening. However, how that ended, the very end of it, .... sigh... way to kill a movie guys. I was going to give the movie 3 stars, but no, you just had to spoil it that way didn't you?",1362009600,,1705,4.349056603773585
5020645,5,B006VJ1A3K,Of course I'd say it's the best movie ever -- especially since I wrote and produced it!  :-) Wouldn't you?,1358899200,3,106,4.3
5020646,2,B006VJ1A3K,"Episode 50 (Joe and Tess Smalley, 2011)

After I watched the final scene of Episode 50, team Smalley's execrable found-footage ""paranormal reality TV show gone wrong"" movie, I had to do a little digging to find out if this had been funded by some uber-right-wing Christian organization. It wasn't, but it has all the hallmarks--it falls into accepting, even embracing, the same stupid occult stereotypes that such flicks use to preach ""the occult is evil, mmmkay?"". They should make anyone else laugh with derision. Deeply depressing stuff, especially coming from a husband-and-wife team who learned their craft at the feet of such directors as Larry Fessenden (Wendigo), Jim Sheridan (In America), and Fenton Bailey (Party Monster); Joe handled various production manager roles on those and many other films on which Tess worked as a production assistant before the two got hitched and started doing their own directing. This is their second feature, and it is awful indeed.

Plot: The Paranormal Inspectors, a successful paranormal-activity reality TV show aimed at debunking possible ""hauntings"", secures the rights to film overnight in a supposedly haunted asylum for its fiftieth episode. What the show's sleazy producer doesn't tell his crew is that he was only able to score this gig if he also allowed the crew of another show, one whose aim is diametrically opposed to that of the Paranormal Inspectors (they are not only believers in paranormal hauntings, but are also highly religious), to accompany them and film as well. It doesn't take long for our intrepid explorers to realize that there is, in fact, something desperately wrong with this place, and that the only way they're going to figure out what it is and stop themselves from getting slaughtered is to work together to figure out what's going on and how to stop it before etc.

To be fair, it's not the worst ""annoying Ghost Adventures guys get their much-deserved comeuppance"" movie I've ever seen. (That would be Grave Encounters, elsewhere this ish...) And I guess if you want to consider the kind of weird religious hack/add-on at the end of the movie original, I can't argue with that, no matter how ineptly it comes off. But still, it would have to reach to achieve the enjoyment factor of House of Bones, and let's face it, if you can't measure up to a SyFy Channel Original Movie after they changed the name to SyFy... * ",1358208000,,2401,4.9503722084367245

5020648,1,B006VJ1A3K,"Episode 50 is a 2011 horror movie focusing on two teams of rival ""Ghost Hunters""; one team looking to de-bunk myths and lore and the other, a team of religious zealots looking to prove the existence of spirits.

I enjoyed the opening of the movie which takes us to Episode 49 of the show and they disprove another ""haunting"" through science and common sense. Sound promising? WRONG. Episode 50 played out like an extended, badly acted episode of Supernatural; while at all times hammering home a none too subtle Christian message; and is clearly an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the likes of the Paranormal Activity movies.

Harking back to the likes of Supernatural, the special effects are acceptable for TV level programming but for a movie of this ilk, it really is about the special effects and sadly, they fell short. I was however impressed with the ""broken nurse"" and some of the scenes involving her which were a little more low-tech.

On the whole, the film was poorly acted but Keithen Hergott as the religiously devout Dylan, I found particularly irritating and was played in an overly dramatic style not in keeping with the tone of the film. The rest of the cast don't seem particularly concerned when their colleagues start getting maimed and tortured by malevolent spirits either. The best of the bunch is Keiron, played by Keiron Elliott; who is apparently along to add a bit of star-power to the proceedings and like any sane person would do, hightails it out of there when things start going awry.

The plot, as with many films with a similar storyline, is fairly straightforward and doesn't require any real degree of concentration to keep pace with.

5020652,1,B006VJ1A3K,"Not worth my time. Sadly this film used a great model, one that I've seen before and hope to see redone again, but it failed in all forms of delivery other than a few of the earliest introductory points.  Episode 50 opens with what I consider an effective strategy.  With hardly any background noise you are presented a taxonomy of paranormal activity increasingly ordered from least to most dangerous--naturally, you're saying to yourself, oh it's gonna' be the that last one.  Already I'm reminded of movies like White Noise (2005), Poltergeist (1982), Paranormal Activity (2007-2011) and Insidious (2010).

Paranormal investigators recognize four classes of hauntings.
1.  Residual--unaware of the living; no interaction or physical contact; not dangerous.
2.  Intelligent--possible physical contact and interactions with objects and people; generally not dangerous.
3.  Poltergeist--trickster spirits with objectives; deceiver; possible physical contact and interactions with objects and people; moderately dangerous.
4.  Inhuman--a spirit that was never human; makes physical contact with objects and people for the purposes of possession, mental manipulation or bodily harm; extremely dangerous.

In the style of Grave Encounters (2011), The Devil Inside (2012) and The Last Exorcism (2010), our story within the movie is being filmed for TV show or documentarian purposes.  It's presented much like an actual episode of the show.  We are introduced to our team of skeptical paranormal investigators who are young, sharp, and are trying to comfort a couple that was hustled by a previous team of people.  Hilarious sidebar: in some surveillance footage the husband, when spooked, hits his wife in the face with a hammer.  The injury make-up is somehow hilarious and really quite good at the same time (until seen up close).  Anyway, their routine and delivery is one part hokey, one part cute, one part well-done.  What do I mean by that?  Well, if you hate Ghost Hunters you'll probably be reminded of that and dislike this for the same reason--that's the ""hokey"" that I don't like.  Thankfully this is a movie, so even you aren't a believer you shouldn't be too bothered.

Our skeptics meet some terminally ill, rich ex-con.  He's played by a terrible character and, along with his two attorneys, will likely diminish this movie's credibility with their deadpan acting.  Their playing lawyers, but I doubt they could argue their way out of a parking ticket--really, like special-ed jocks taking pre-algebra in 12th grade stupid.  Anyway, our team is offered two days of unfettered access to a previously inaccessible location: ""The Gates to Hell,"" the West Virginia State Lunatic Asylum considered the most haunted locale.  Why does a rich, dying ex-con care about this?  Because if they can debunk ""Hell,"" then maybe he won't spend eternity burning there.  At first, I thought that most of the bad reviews of this film were due to random actors with little screen time (e.g., the rich guy's lawyers).  But I found additional legitimate complaints.

We see expert testimonials from doctors and computer analysts delivering realistic fact-based explanations for paranormal phenomena and pointing out the things we can't solve.  This montage felt very effective if, and only if, I ignored the clips with these twin psychology students who--despite delivering good information--had completely hamstrung the credibility of the whole scene.  Really, they were awful and clearly the result of a small casting pool or hiring a friend as a favor.  Bad call!

Our team meets a rival team.  Our apparent protagonist team of skeptics (the ""Paranormal Inspectors"") expects to debunk the landmark haunting of this most haunted site whereas the other team (amateurs of the Academia Spirit Searchers Club, the ASSC or ""Ask"") hopes to confirm the presence of a demonic spirit--that was stage 4 on the paranormal danger scale that opens the movie.  The leader of ASSC is an over-enthusiastic zealot and is a character of questionable credibility.

Now the screen cuts to black and the following caption is presented:  ""During the shoot, something went wrong.  In an unexpected move, the parent network of the show cancelled the series before airing episode 50.  Nobody knew what actually happened during the filming.  Until now.""

They arrive on the scene.  I was hoping for a little more Session 9 (2001) in terms of site eeriness.  The ""show"" footage scenes earlier in the film were quite good, but the ""behind the scenes"" acting involving real interactions (i.e., not using Paranormal Investigator TV show personas) degenerates rapidly.  Then there's a slapstick Scottish dude who, like so many other additions to this flick, further cripples whatever credibility the film had left--if any.

Top shelf production quality.  This film had a great model, but simply too many flaws in its execution to be passable, or even forgivable.  I really don't mean to belittle the intelligence of youth, but this movie would be better suited for middle and high schoolers.  Having generally less life experience and, more importantly, having seen considerably fewer movies, it will be harder for them to catch the outlandish tactics used in this movie.  Like how quickly the two teams go from hating each other to getting along, the ridiculousness of the rich guy who got them access, the first ""odd encounter"" at the site involving the mysterious movement of some duct tape.  There's no slow build-up or increasing tension, but rather the team members immediately encounter numerous unsubtle sounds, voices, slamming doors and objects moving about.  There's really no sense of tone as was done so well in Session 9, Grave Encounters, White Noise and the Paranormal Activity movies.  The storytelling feels like an adult version of a campfire ghost story told immaturely.

I won't give away ""what"" they encounter, but I will say that some Japanese-style horror tactics are used, and not done as well as the Japanese.  The sightings are always caught on camera, often seen by the team members, and far too frequent to be at all effective.

SO WHO WAS THIS MOVIE MADE FOR?  Sometime after graduating to pull-up diapers and training wheels horror hound pups should have ""baby's first haunting flick.""  I think this is it.  It's way in-your-face, plot and points are blatantly drilled to a nub, the characters are immature and never really develop, and you don't have to look too hard to ""catch"" anything.  Most horror relies on observant viewers to ""catch"" the quick, unsettling glance of something.  Here anything that happens, even if briefly, is accompanied by sound and then washed, rinsed and repeated seconds later.  Like any such movie, the characters get killed.  But the deaths aren't very intense--nothing is hard to watch.  Also, the images may be scary to some, but I would consider them hardly disturbing compared to so much other material out there even from PG-13 flicks.  Lastly, all mysteries and questions are answered within minutes of their inception.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  White Noise (2005), Poltergeist (1982), Paranormal Activity (2007-2011), Grave Encounters (2011), and maybe The Last Exorcism (2010) or Insidious (2010).  Also Session 9 (2001), although there are no ""investigators"" in it.",1345161600,,7297,5.220120378331901

In the style of Grave Encounters (2011), The Devil Inside (2012) and The Last Exorcism (2010), our story within the movie is being filmed for TV show or documentarian purposes.  It's presented much like an actual episode of the show.  We are introduced to our team of skeptical paranormal investigators who are young, sharp, and are trying to comfort a couple that was hustled by a previous team of people.  Hilarious sidebar: in some surveillance footage the husband, when spooked, hits his wife in the face with a hammer.  The injury make-up is somehow hilarious and really quite good at the same time (until seen up close).  Anyway, their routine and delivery is one part hokey, one part cute, one part well-done.  What do I mean by that?  Well, if you hate Ghost Hunters you'll probably be reminded of that and dislike this for the same reason--that's the ""hokey"" that I don't like.  Thankfully this is a movie, so even you aren't a believer you shouldn't be too bothered.

Our skeptics meet some terminally ill, rich ex-con.  He's played by a terrible character and, along with his two attorneys, will likely diminish this movie's credibility with their deadpan acting.  Their playing lawyers, but I doubt they could argue their way out of a parking ticket--really, like special-ed jocks taking pre-algebra in 12th grade stupid.  Anyway, our team is offered two days of unfettered access to a previously inaccessible location: ""The Gates to Hell,"" the West Virginia State Lunatic Asylum considered the most haunted locale.  Why does a rich, dying ex-con care about this?  Because if they can debunk ""Hell,"" then maybe he won't spend eternity burning there.  At first, I thought that most of the bad reviews of this film were due to random actors with little screen time (e.g., the rich guy's lawyers).  But I found additional legitimate complaints.

We see expert testimonials from doctors and computer analysts delivering realistic fact-based explanations for paranormal phenomena and pointing out the things we can't solve.  This montage felt very effective if, and only if, I ignored the clips with these twin psychology students who--despite delivering good information--had completely hamstrung the credibility of the whole scene.  Really, they were awful and clearly the result of a small casting pool or hiring a friend as a favor.  Bad call!

Our team meets a rival team.  Our apparent protagonist team of skeptics (the ""Paranormal Inspectors"") expects to debunk the landmark haunting of this most haunted site whereas the other team (amateurs of the Academia Spirit Searchers Club, the ASSC or ""Ask"") hopes to confirm the presence of a demonic spirit--that was stage 4 on the paranormal danger scale that opens the movie.  The leader of ASSC is an over-enthusiastic zealot and is a character of questionable credibility.

Now the screen cuts to black and the following caption is presented:  ""During the shoot, something went wrong.  In an unexpected move, the parent network of the show cancelled the series before airing episode 50.  Nobody knew what actually happened during the filming.  Until now.""

They arrive on the scene.  I was hoping for a little more Session 9 (2001) in terms of site eeriness.  The ""show"" footage scenes earlier in the film were quite good, but the ""behind the scenes"" acting involving real interactions (i.e., not using Paranormal Investigator TV show personas) degenerates rapidly.  Then there's a slapstick Scottish dude who, like so many other additions to this flick, further cripples whatever credibility the film had left--if any.

Top shelf production quality.  This film had a great model, but simply too many flaws in its execution to be passable, or even forgivable.  I really don't mean to belittle the intelligence of youth, but this movie would be better suited for middle and high schoolers.  Having generally less life experience and, more importantly, having seen considerably fewer movies, it will be harder for them to catch the outlandish tactics used in this movie.  Like how quickly the two teams go from hating each other to getting along, the ridiculousness of the rich guy who got them access, the first ""odd encounter"" at the site involving the mysterious movement of some duct tape.  There's no slow build-up or increasing tension, but rather the team members immediately encounter numerous unsubtle sounds, voices, slamming doors and objects moving about.  There's really no sense of tone as was done so well in Session 9, Grave Encounters, White Noise and the Paranormal Activity movies.  The storytelling feels like an adult version of a campfire ghost story told immaturely.

I won't give away ""what"" they encounter, but I will say that some Japanese-style horror tactics are used, and not done as well as the Japanese.  The sightings are always caught on camera, often seen by the team members, and far too frequent to be at all effective.

SO WHO WAS THIS MOVIE MADE FOR?  Sometime after graduating to pull-up diapers and training wheels horror hound pups should have ""baby's first haunting flick.""  I think this is it.  It's way in-your-face, plot and points are blatantly drilled to a nub, the characters are immature and never really develop, and you don't have to look too hard to ""catch"" anything.  Most horror relies on observant viewers to ""catch"" the quick, unsettling glance of something.  Here anything that happens, even if briefly, is accompanied by sound and then washed, rinsed and repeated seconds later.  Like any such movie, the characters get killed.  But the deaths aren't very intense--nothing is hard to watch.  Also, the images may be scary to some, but I would consider them hardly disturbing compared to so much other material out there even from PG-13 flicks.  Lastly, all mysteries and questions are answered within minutes of their inception.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  White Noise (2005), Poltergeist (1982), Paranormal Activity (2007-2011), Grave Encounters (2011), and maybe The Last Exorcism (2010) or Insidious (2010).  Also Session 9 (2001), although there are no ""investigators"" in it.",1345161600,4,7297,5.220120378331901
8504995,3,B006VJ1A3K,This could have been a rather good movie. The over all story was pretty well thought out... but some of the acting and goodlord the CGI was just terrible and completely destoryed what could have been a good tale. I am giving it 3 stars because of the story.,1519862400,,257,4.26530612244898
8504996,1,B006VJ1A3K,"A few years ago, I bought this movie for $1.50 at a Blockbuster that was going out of business...and I honestly felt ripped off.

I can find something good to write about almost any horror movie with half a plot. ""Episode 50"" didn't have half a plot. It sort of had maybe a quarter of an idea for half a plot.

It's not even a movie, really. It's some bad shots of bad ghosts, random ""jump scares"" that won't make you jump because they're not scary, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, and no direction.

Worst of all: it's Christian propaganda through and through. This movie is strictly for the ""I'm in my early 20's, I picket abortion clinics, and I need a Christian alternative to Paranormal Activity because I'd go to hell for watching a non-Christian film"" demographic.

The only other film I've ever hated as much as I hate ""Epsidoe 50"" was the film ""Going Places"" by Bertrand Blier.

My one true hope for the history of cinema is that this film is lost to time and nobody even remembers it existed by the year 2020. If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would.

PS- I ended up basically giving my copy of ""Episode 50"" away for 25cents of store credit towards a horror movie that's actually good (Absentia).",1509235200,,1214,4.470588235294118
