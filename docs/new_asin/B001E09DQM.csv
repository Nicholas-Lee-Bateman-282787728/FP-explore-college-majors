8295768,4,B001E09DQM,"I absolutely LOVE this product.  I purchased it in preparation for live lessons with the author, Susan Carr.  Susan is an extraordinary person.  She is able to reach down into your soul and coerce the greatness out of it.  One of the best purchases I have ever made regarding my music.  Anyone who is aspiring to be a singer/screamer should try to find this disc.  Unfortunately it's now out of print due to piracy, but you can still get the iOS app.

For anyone who's never heard of Susan Carr, she was Layne Staley's vocal instructor prior to Alice in Chains hitting it big.",1442534400,,576,4.480769230769231

8295770,4,B001E09DQM,"This DVD provides some helpful warm-ups that teach you different placement techniques, but not much more. There is a short section where one of Susan Carr's students explains how he does it, but there is really no in depth explanation from her anywhere on the DVD about harsh screaming/growling execution. Interestingly, she never screams herself.* This DVD is best for the beginner who has no real experience. As I said, I believe that the warm-ups could be helpful, but if you have more questions than the relatively brief DVD footage can answer (which you probably will), you'll be better off seeking the assistance of a professional coach. This is more like an introduction to Susan Carr, and her teaching style, with testimonials from her students. It is not a complete waste, but it really does not compare to having an actual coach to cater to your specific needs. Take it or leave it.

*The closest it gets to her screaming is a clean, high-pitched shriek during the men's training section. Nothing like what I was aiming for as it is nothing that I am not already capable of doing myself. Though I have not really had much in the way of formal vocal training, I would not consider myself a ""beginner."" I thought that it would only be fair if I mentioned that though. I didn't consider it a ""scream.""

8295771,3,B001E09DQM,"So, I've been a musician (electric bass) since 1992, and I recently decided to do death growls in the very songs I suddenly started to write. That wasn't coming along as well as I would've hoped, so I got this DVD.
 Frankly, if it was advertised as a basic vocal instruction thing, then it would be great. You get basic vocal warm-ups, with a few moments of ""screaming"" instruction near the end.
This is not to say that it was a complete waste of money. I think the exercises do help in warming up your voice, and hence avoiding injury. But, it doesn't quite go into detail into the growling/screaming, which is a disappointment.

I must say I got meself ""The Zen of Screaming 2"" by Melissa Cross, and it is MUCH better. It goes into details like different vocal styles, and shows you (via an endoscopy cam?) EXACTLY how the vocal cords should be moving (or not) with each. Now, THAT's something.

If you want some good vocal warm-ups, with an accompanying audio CD, then by all means get this. If you want a comprehensive screaming method, look elsewhere.",1273622400,2,1056,4.5473684210526315
8295772,5,B001E09DQM,"I originally left negative feedback for this seller, but it was an honest mistake. Susan Carr, the seller and vocal trainer in the video, is a great seller who cares about each customer, and I didn't have any problems at all with my purchase. Amazon wouldn't allow me to remove my negative feedback, so I wanted to at least clear it up here.
I ordered this DVD along with the Zen of Screaming 1 and 2. I think this is where the mistake happened because I actually had trouble with the Zen of Screaming seller - not Susan Carr. I use the Art of Screaming warm up CD every time I have band practice or a show. I love it! Before using the warm-up CD, my voice would be hoarse or non-existent, and my throat would be sore. Now, my throat doesn't hurt at all and my vocal chords are not compromised. It has been a great investment. I recommend this DVD and CD if your voice suffers after screaming. I have to say that it doesn't teach you how to scream, but it's still a great tool to use.",1253577600,2,984,4.184210526315789
8295773,4,B001E09DQM,"I liked the video alot but its short and it touches on screaming, i feel like its teaching you warm ups more than teaching you to scream but i still liked it",1222732800,2,157,3.9375
8295774,5,B001E09DQM,"The Art Of Screaming is Fantastic!!!!I have been singing for over 20 years. I have purchased so many singing/instructional CD'S that are difficult to understand and do nothing!!!!!
The Art Of Screaming package is hands down the best out there.
Not only do you receive a DVD of a live lesson (which makes you feel like you are right there) to practice with, you also receive a cd that you can rehearse with before a show, on tour,in the shower, where ever you are ,Sue Carr is right there with you with invaluable instruction on the correct way to do it all. And it's fun.
This CD/DVD combo has changed my whole thought process on how to sing, and not to sound to corny but it has changed my life!!!!
If you want to better your vocals this package is totally worth checking out!!!!",1222041600,5,780,4.423611111111111
8295775,5,B001E09DQM,"I've been studying vocals for almost ten years and was disappointed with every screaming method dvd or cd I bought. None of them delivered what they promised and I wasted a ton of money. Most of them don't even really show you how to actually produce a scream. This dvd and cd combo helped my studio recordings, live shows and rehearsals from the very first time I used it. It shows you what a scream is, how to make it properly, gives you exercises to practice on dvd, and includes a cd to practice with, on your own, in the car on the way to rehearsal, or whatever. Do yourself a favor, if you want to improve your scream or rasp, buy this dvd. It's the only one worth the money and I own all of them.",1220918400,7,703,4.138686131386861
