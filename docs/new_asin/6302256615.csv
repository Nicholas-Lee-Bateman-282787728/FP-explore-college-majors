441962,5,6302256615,"Thoughtful and intelligent it is not, but if you are looking for non-stop action this is a can't miss.  This movie should come with a warning label because I have never watched a movie which has inspired me to pick up so many dangerous habits(surfing, sky-diving and drinking Coronas!) It is  shocking that this movie is over two hours in length because it seems to  fly by.  The sky-diving scene shots are incredible, and Swayze even manages  to get in a couple of ""Road House"" like fight scenes.  Check this  one out today if you are an action buff, hopefully it will be available on  DVD soon.",932947200,2,596,4.5046728971962615
441963,5,6302256615,"This is a movie  for anyone who likes action packed movies. Keanu Reeves should be the King of all actors. The plot is rich with suspense, action and salavates with adenlyn. This movie will keep on the edge of your  seat,your jaw dropped and your eyes won't blink. 'Point Break' is a movie  every human being should own.",917654400,2,320,4.482758620689655

442006,3,6302256615,"Point Break: A lot of action and new kid on the block bravado from Keanu Reeves. A lot of morally convenient Zen from Patrick Swayze. Kind of like Michael Mann's ""Heat"" if the characters in ""Heat"" were all just out of high school. Somehow Gary Busey doesn't ruin the movie. John C. McGinley deserved some sort of award for playing the most one-note character in the whole movie. I'm not going to give away the ending but it would have been better if they would have just kissed on that beach.",1520985600,,492,4.417582417582418

442011,5,6302256615,I may be one of the few people who never saw this...

442012,1,6302256615,The movie is too pat.  Someone took a cookie cutter from previous crime movies and produced this poor piece of entertainment.  Surprising that these major stars participated.,1519689600,,174,5.407407407407407

442038,4,6302256615,"I love Point Break. In fact it's in my top 3 movies! This special edition is for anyone who wants a little bit more background to the movie, but doesn't expect to be blown away. The movie itself is exactly the same as the original; no added scenes or anything. In the extras area on the DVD, the deleted scenes are mostly pathetic. Some were literally so stupid it would have made the movie less than what it was. So to highlight these deleted scenes as something special, well, it's not. What was worth it were the behind-the-scenes interviews, which give some more detail to characters and show how people look 10+ years later. It's somewhat insightful, and cool to see how much people liked acting in the movie. Overall I'd say buy this edition if you love the original Point Break. However if you already own the DVD, I'd skip this.",1515542400,,836,4.506578947368421

Felt a lot like a rollercoaster ride. Those skydiving scenes had me holding my breath as you could actually see the rock mountains rushing closer and closer. This movie had it all and all it had was done great. The camera filming and the editing really did a great job, as good as the X-Presidents rob banks. That scene where Tyler jumps out of the truck and runs as fast as she can to Utah, forgiving all the issues because Love is so strong nothing else matters.

442102,1,6302256615,"I can only assume that all the positive reviews are from people who saw it as teenagers in the '90s and wish it was still that era, and aren't watching this movie so much as reminiscing about their youthful selves.

This movie is absolute *dreck*---just, literally, everything about it. The dialogue is AWFUL--imagine your cliche cop scenes, with the ""tough police chief"" yelling and angry from the get-go; the irascible ""old cop"" who isn't taken seriously but wants to prove his worth, and the young ""up-start"" cop who comes in, partners with the old guy, and then they go ""against the grain"" b/c that's ""just the kind of cops they are!""

Oh god, can you taste the vomit in the back of your throat yet? But wait, there's more!

Then there's the ""uncatchable"" criminals who just want some sweet waves, brah! Despite robbing dozens of banks, in a clear ""seasonal"" pattern, not once have they been caught b/c they're just. That. Good! (eye roll)

Add the side-chick ""tomboy"" who hangs as tough as the boys but of course falls for our hero, ""Johnny Utah"" (b/c that's a believable name!), the most preposterous ending imaginable, and laughably bad acting, and there's Point Break!",1513036800,3,1176,4.806930693069307

That was a central theme of the movie, but it didn't appeal to me. The sky diving stuff was nice to watch, but really didn't fit well with the story. And what was this about holding the girl hostage? That didn't make any sense.",1512777600,,367,4.183098591549296

442138,5,6302256615,"Point Break is an amazing action film. It has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen, particularly the skydiving sequences. Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and Gary Busey are all great. It's not a particularly deep story, but it goes from one fast paced scene to another and it never gets old. It's more about the feeling of it all rather than getting some deeper meaning from it, although that is there to an extent as well. Really excellent film.

Its got babes in bikinis and dudes with guns so obviously I loved it and so will you if you like awesome things that are obviously cool and full of action. THEY JUMP OUT OF PLANE!

Keanu goes undercover and joins the gang to stop their crime spree in its tracks. I would definitely recommend this movie.

442892,3,6302256615,"A bunch of men dressed in US President's masks rob banks. The local FBI branch is trying to find out who. New guy transferred from DC to LA FBI. He is put on the case with a veteran guy who has so far not followed upon his on own ideas of who is behind it--surfers--because he fears people inside the FBI would laugh at his theory. They embed the new FBI guy in the surfer crowd to test their theory.

I never even thought about going near this movie back when it came out. I remember it clearly. Never was a fan of Swayze or Reeves. The two didn't have any appeal to me. Never bought the heart throb stuff Hollywood tried to sell around them. Never. Never thought they were easy on the eyes or even good actors. So I skipped this. The movie looked silly to me. I guess it is my dislike of the surfer/druggie crowd. Not my taste either. For whatever reason I revisited the movie.

It turns out to be not be that bad. I thought it would have had zero plot and just be rehashed stereotypes of southern Californians and the way that they talk. There was a little in there. But it had a plot. But it turns out the plot was more like the gang members code of honor nonsense. I don't like those movies either as I don't buy into that crazy thought. What I found kinda funny was the Keanu Reeves' character was supposed to be some uptight east coast DC FBI agent who didn't fit in. But he appeared more surfer dude than the other characters/actors who were supposed to be local LA FBI. Additionally the movie has that sleazy aspect to it where people are laying around, sleeping around, wasting their lives, etc. Made the movie even more distasteful.

I think Gary Busey should have gotten shared billing for this movie given his part and how he handled it. I never liked him as an actor. But in this he seemed like a semi-decent character. You get to see yet another beautiful southern actress. She reminds me of the other southern supporting actress that was in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and was in an episode of ""Moonlighting"". Good actresses. Beautiful. Have that natural all-American look.",1463961600,,2090,4.381443298969073

442970,4,6302256615,"Point break is a cult movie. Just like that! It covers many itmes behind the label of another thriller. It concerns with a singular outsider (Patrick Swayze in memory) who plays heard with the danger in a double role: as leader of a gang and his most ambitious experience, to break the waves as surfist.

When a FBI agent (Keanu Reeves) is assigned to track Swayze, this agent will experience the exciting of challenging the rules, as well as other non conventional codes.

So, what we find here are a clash of egos as well as a growing approach between two ways of living or dealing with the normal life. Two additional plus to remark are the agile and frantic script and (to my view) the best performance given by Swayze in his lifetime.

If you think it carefully you'll find a certain connection with Fight Club years later. But the film explores and carves in relief the facet of a gangster from another perspective.

If you remember Jean Luc Bresson's Deep Blue, you will have adrenaline enough to keep you hold to your seat. Besides, consider the fact the recent remake of Point break tells it all. Don't you?

Giving this movie a 3 is generous to say the least. Its absolutely terrible and not in the good way where its funny if you are drinking. Its just plain dumb. Most of these high star reviews are from people looking at this film with rose colored glasses. I can say I do the same with some movies from my real young days but I do not understand the overwhelming positive reviews as if every single review is from someone who saw the movie on release night in 91.

Oops. The surfing, skydiving, etc scenes are decidedly run of the mill. I don't think this movie should be watched on the Jumbotron.  Or maybe it's not even the size that matters. Perhaps it's due to the preponderance of X-Games GoPro action footage and Michael Bay movies. Either way, the only redeeming qualities of Point Break haven't stood the test of time. The acting is, of course, mediocre at best. Patrick Swayze, evidently an amazing guy in real life, rarely brought more to the screen than his good looks. And Keanu? Well, mostly miss in the hit-or-miss department, although he was outstanding in Rivers Edge.

443262,5,6302256615,"Kathryn Bigelows terrific 1991 thriller Point Break is the story of a former football star turned F.B.I. agent  that takes up surfing to infiltrate a gang (also surfers) of bank robbers. The movie, while initially panned by film critics, actually boasts a rather witty dialogue; an out-of-this-world cast featuring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, and stunning cinematography that make everybody wish they lived close enough to catch a couple waves.

Point Break centers on a group of California-based bank robberies that requires a young and energetic FBI agent (Reeves) to infiltrate the gang and bring them to justice. Along the way we meet Reeves partnerthe always enjoyable Gary Busey, his love interestLori Petty, and his less than flattering bossa young and spry John C. McGinley. The movie is a nonstop adrenaline rush that closely follows and hangs on Reeves and Swayzes onscreen chemistry, and goes as far as to even employ the Red Hot Chili Peppers as additional bad boys from the beach. The movie really pulls out all the late 80s/early 90s stops: big explosions, over-the-top special effects, and clever one-liners that still have a throng of fans repeating 25 years later.

Point Break is one of my all-time favorite movies. I guess that may make my review biased in a manner of speaking, but the movie really is an exciting and energetic thrill ride that makes even the most stubborn land lover want to grab a surf board and head for the waves. If you enjoy that late 80s action style and dialogue then this is your movie for sure , but don't let that stop you, anyone can enjoy this movie.",1451088000,,1605,4.850364963503649

this is not shakespeare, this is action adventure at the highest level. PB doesn't pretend to insult you with noble ideas or complex plot lines. in fact, PB is nothing other than what you would expect from keanu and swayze, a fun cinematic ride. add to the mix, gary busey and you have a tinder box waiting to explode. the one liners are incredibly cheesy, but this is what adds to the fun. you are not suppose to take this movie seriously, and that my friends is the point.",1447027200,,1218,4.561643835616438

They are after the ex-presidents, who have eluded the the FBI for years. Pappas believes they are surfers and Utah goes undercover, where he falls for Tyler (Lori Petty also seen in Tank Girl, 1995) and befriends the endless summer living and point break catching, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Filled with a unique plot, surfing, skydiving, and great action that has been copied since, like the foot chase of Utah and Bodhi over fences and through the neighborhoods, and has gone on to be a cult classic. Although unbelievable at times, like Utah devoting his career to finding Bodhi and some of the FBI protocol, and has some cheesy but quotable line, its gripping and suspenseful down to the last scene.

443499,2,6302256615,"I have read that some consider this film to be a cult classic (I suppose the standards for admission to cult status have changed somewhat since I was boy).

In this film you will be exposed to two actors, Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey, miscast as FBI agents - neither have the look or demeanor of lawyers, or top echelon law enforcement agents. Moreover Keanu Reeves character is supposed to be a former star collegiate football player (who played in the Rose Bowl), but he has neither the physique nor the demeanor for that role either. In fairness, Patrick Swayze is well cast in his role as an elite adrenalin junkie.

The plot relies heavily on characters brandishing guns, and the holding of those guns to one another's heads to compel them to do something. Also featured prominently is the threatening of the life of a hostage. This hostage taking  is supposed to be the ultimate tool to get people to do what you want.  I don't think Hollywood types have any notion that there are some things more valuable than clinging to life. Didn't someone once say - ""Give me liberty, or give me death""?

Anyway, for the thinking person this film is littered with improbables or impossibles - an FBI raid on a house full of surfers (most of those surfers die in this raid) in which the FBI has no probable cause for entry into that house. These guys are suspected of being bank robbers without a single shred of evidence to back it up. The producers of this film were counting on lack of mental acumen in the audience to obscure, and the alleged overwhelming magnificence of the action scenes to distract, from nonsense like this. Also, Keanu Reeves is constantly severely reinjuring a knee originally badly injured in football (it ended his football career) yet he manages to recover over and over again to go surfing, sky diving; you name it.

You can find a better way to spend you evening than with a loser film like this.",1443312000,3,1920,4.5830903790087465

443539,5,6302256615,"Growing up I never heard good things about this movie. It was one of Keanu's earliest starring roles and mostly was talked about as a joke. I'm sure I caught a few minutes here and there but finally when I was in my 20's I watched the whole thing. AND IT WAS AMAZING. I'm not saying that ironically either. It really is a fun and great action movie.

You have to remember its filled with fun actors, Keanu coming off Bill and Ted, Swayze fresh off Ghost and Roadhouse, Gary Busey (Crazy as ever) and directed by Catherine Bigelow who has proven herself to be one of the best Director's alive. There's also a cameo by Anthony Kedis!

Besides the fact that its a bank heist movie (so its automatically going to have some tension and be a little fun) you've got this crazy villain who isn't even entirely evil. He's not some drug lord who's abusing women. He just robs banks to live off the grid and surf. Sometimes he's almost a good guy...almost. In fact the movie would have been better if they had allowed him to end the movie on a less psychopathic note. Towards the end he starts to abandon his Zen tendencies and just straight up be evil. Technically the good guys don't even truly win in this movie. They just don't lose either.

Other great aspects of this movie are the fun action scenes including car chases, explosions and well shot skydiving and surfing scenes. I know you might be laughing but the skydiving scenes are shot over canyons so you see these guys falling over pristine gorges and orange rocks surrounded by blue lakes and water. Its a sight to be seen. Additionally the surf photography is bettter than most surf films. Maybe its the professional touch of Hollywood or just the slo mo and cinemetography but its a beautiful film to watch.

The Bonus segments on the disc are pretty minimal but I picked it up for $5 so its nice to have it in HD.",1441756800,3,1868,4.421511627906977

A little about the movie without any spoilers:
Keanu Reeves plays an undercover FBI agent named Johnny Utah whose first assignment is to infiltrate the surfing scene and find out what surfing group is robbing banks costumed as ""The Dead Presidents"". This movie is filled with action and adventure while Utah deals with the issues of being undercover and having loyalty as an FBI agent as well as friendship.

443840,5,6302256615,"Point Break is one of those movies I actually first became aware of during my teenage years. I also recently watched this film curious to understand my late adoptive mothers fascination with Patrick Swayze (who plays Bodhi in point Break)when she was alive (she admitted that Patrick Swayze was one of the men she found attractive). There are other major stars attach to Point Break as well such as  Keanu Reeves (as FBI Agent Johnny Utah), Garey Busey (FBI Agent Angelo Pappas), Lori Petty (Tyler Endicott), Lee Tergesen (Rosie) and others.  Johnny Utah is given information by Angelo Pappas about the unsolved bank robberies. There were 27 banks in 3 years and they would often be in and out in 90 seconds. There are four men involved and they go to the robberies dressed as these late presidents; Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Regan, and Jimmy Carter. To complicate matters, Johnny Utah is never quite the same emotionally once he hears about Tyler Endicott and runs into her in person. Pappas is naturally concerned about catching the robbers as quick as possible because they only hit  during the summer. One way that Johnny Utah strives to go undercover is by learning what it takes to surf in order to simultaneously get closer to Tyler Endicott and gain the trust of Bodhi and his crew. Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers makes a few cameos in Point Break as well (in the role of Tone). Another cameo feature in Point Break is the late Christopher Lee Pettiet (I remembered him from Dont Tell Mom The Babysitter is Dead). Anyhow, Johnny Utah and Angelo Pappas have their work cut out for them in trying to get the bank robbers because the men have robbed so many banks to the point where they have learned how to stay one step ahead of the law authorities. It also doesnt help that Tyler and Bodhi are strongly connected together and Utah is portrayed as being in emotional conflict due to being so much in love with Tyler while being aware that he must cooperate with Pappas.",1434672000,2,2004,4.655367231638418

443938,4,6302256615,"Point Break is a very good film overall from the 80s/90s heyday of action-dramas. Kathryn Bigelow's first box office smash, starring Reeves and Swayze in roles that fit them well, deserves a look from people that haven't seen it before. It doesn't have much wrong with it from a critical perspective IMO, and most scenes still work well today.

The Bluray is good quality with a nice bitrate and a transfer that at times can be soft but is mostly pretty decent for a minor catalogue title. I was happy with how transfer came out. For 5 bucks the action and surfing sequences are usually very well done and the story is fairly creative for its day. Recommended.",1432166400,2,660,4.593220338983051

443974,5,6302256615,"This is a genuine early 1990s movie.
Fresh young faces of actors that we came to like, and even love.
Really bad acting, bad clothes, and a simple yet interesting plot.
Surfers wearing ex presidents masks robbing banks, while two
FBI agents (a young and a elder one) try to get them. That simple.

To compensate for the really bad acting of Keanu Reeves and  Gary Busey
there are some great surfer shots, which leave you with an open mouth even
if you don't like surfing. And of course there are the sky diving scenes!!!

Patrick Swayze is the modern original surfer, a title lost after his death, by
the super ultimate surfer icon, Matthew Mcconaughey

444032,5,6302256615,"Point Break was far better than I expected. My expectations are usually pretty low when Reeves and Swayze are involved in a movie, but this film is a qualitative exception. The story line is believable, even partly historical. If you've ever surfed, you're going to laugh at all the complements about the CA coast when, in fact, the movie is showing the Oregon coast, which is much rougher. But, still, the last part of the film is going to take you to the most terrifying surfing water on Earth. You don't have to be a surfing fan, or ready to go back in time when you were still able to do that. The film stands alone without that, and I recommend it.",1428019200,,653,4.360655737704918

I especially liked Lori Petty's performance where she used her whole body to express herself. Watching the surfing scenes photographed in gorgeous light was an adrenaline rush.

Alas, as the movie unfolded, the director seemed more invested in the action sequences than the characters. The parachute jumping scene, exciting as it was, felt like it belonged in another movie. The third act especially suffered from plot holes and an overly drawn out resolution between Swayze and Reeves.

444295,4,6302256615,"Really you just need to suspend your disbelief about Keanu Reeves finishing high school, going to college and graduating, going to law school and graduating, and getting a job with the FBI...no big deal.  Well, in his role as a rookie FBI agent in Los Angeles, Reeves must go undercover as a surfer to ferret out a gang of surfing bank robbers who are known for wearing masks of the faces of ex-Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Lyndon B. Johnson.  Right away, I liked Gary Busey as the senior FBI agent on the case.  He had the rugged-cop thing going to the point where it wasn't clich or stereotypical...you could actually connect with this guy.  But none of the other cast members quite matched up to Mr. Busey.  Lori Petty played the main character's love interest (something every Keanu Reeves seems to require) and that's it.  I don't recall her performance being bad or anything like that...I just don't recall anything remarkably good about it either.  She was just there so this film could have a love interest.  Patrick Swayze and his band of surfers were interesting but I sometimes felt that they were trying too hard...yes, we get it.  You live a surfer's lifestyle with the waves, the babes, and the tubes...no rules.  Thank you for making that so clear that a blind man like myself could literally see that.  But for all it's faults, this film was actually pretty good, particularly when Keanu Reeves wasn't trying (and failing) to speak like some sort of scientific super-genius.  When he was just acting like a guy trying to get through life and keep his job in the process, he actually wasn't that bad...it was when he was spewing technical phrases about evidence that annoyed me.  He also had pretty good chemistry with Patrick Swayze, who too was enjoyable to watch when he wasn't pressing the surfing thing down on us.  This chemistry allowed me to identify with their later conflicts much more readily.  This is definitely beyond any sort of cop or action thriller.  There's a story with characters and suspense and a decent conclusion.  Given how our government agencies operate today, that world-wide hunt in the end seems very plausible.  Overall, a good film.

Even more disappointed is his new partner - jaded burnout Angelo Pappas. No one seems to have any faith in Utah even though he's taking it all seriously.

Their first case together is the pursuit of the Ex-Presidents, a gang of ironic bank robbers who pull-off 60-second robberies to fund their hedonistic lifestyle. Pappas just wants to let it go, but Utah's energy reinvigorates him and they go undercover in the LA surf scene where Utah meets boyish, unattractive Tyler who teaches him how to ride a wave and introduces him to Bohdi and his gang of easy-going pals.

I'm not going to lie, Point Break has its problems. Keanu's acting is bad, not as bad as he is in Speed, but still bad, and totally one-note. He even somehow manages to gradually turn Johnny Utah into Ted ""Theodore"" Logan by the end. Lori Petty is completely mis-cast as Tyler and far, far too mannish for the role. There's also practically no mystery as to who the Ex-Presidents really are since Swayze's voice is recognizable from the very beginning.

The action, surf photography (shot in fake Super-35 widescreen), and occasional atmosphere make up for it. Not to mention anything with Gary Busey is worthwhile and he barely keeps himself in check, playing Pappas with his usual manic energy. The centerpiece of the whole movie is without a doubt the skydiving scene, which is beautifully breathtaking. Mark Isham's score for this scene is simply wonderful, and, as a teenager, I would watch this scene over and over to the point where the VHS tape eventually got worn-out.

Point Break has gone on to be a cult classic inspiring rip-offs such as The Fast and the Furious (and a soon-to-be unnecessary remake that no one wants starring box office poison Gerard Butler) and a spoof stage show. Kathryn Bigelow, who was one of James Cameron's many wives at the time, has only made 5 films since 1991 which is strange for a director so solid with a near-perfect track record. Even her worst films have merit, though she did go on to win big with The Hurt Locker in 2009.

It may be soaking in early 90s surf culture, but that's the only thing that dates it and any remake, re-imagining, reboots, or re-interpretation is not needed.

444385,4,6302256615,"One cannot venture into American cinema without coming across this gem.  I'm not sure how they came up with this movie, but it is almost as though they said, we want surfing, bank robberies, a moron, an old fart and skydiving(yes, skydiving) and this is what they came up with.  Where should I start?

The movie starts Keannu Reeves and Gary Busey as two detectives, moron and old fart.  Reeves is agent Utah and Busey is agent Pappas(I think theres a beer names Pappas).  Pappas has been unsuccessful at finding the ""X-presidents"" a group of bank robbers who have gone on for years.  Pappas theory: ""they're surfers.""  Sample dialogue from movie:

Pappas: ""they're surfers""

Utah: ""surfers?""

Pappas: ""surfers!""

Utah: ""surfers?""

So they're surfers.  So special agent Utah goes undercover to try to find him.  His plan?  He's going to get a surfboard, learn how to surf, hangout at the beach and eventually find these surfers.  Huh???  I guess when I was 10 and first saw it I didn't think about it, but now that I consider it, what exactly could his plan have been?  I mean, which beach do you actually start at???  Do you make you make friends with surfers and see if they rob banks???

Anyhow, he starts hanging out at the beach and eventually finds Patrick Swayzee and his group of friends and confirms they are the robbers(he matches a hair sample from one of his friends to evidence found at a bank they robbed).  What follows is Utah's attempts to bring down Swayzee(named Bodhi in the movie) and his gang.

Overall, I guess the movie is about the surfer, free spirited lifestyle compared to do the tied down way of life society wants you live.  At first Reeves character is only concerned with justice and accomplishing that goal, only to be persuaded by the Swayzee character and his laid back, philosophical approach to life.  Swayzee is trying to bring out the spirit in Reeves character in a way.

The movie is interesting because its not enough that the bad guys are surfers, they're also skydivers.  Its like they spend all their free time and money on outdoors/extreme sports type of stuff.  Maybe they feel like they need to rob banks just to afford those hobbies.

I recommend watching and/or buying this movie, its worth a few viewings.  You'll be entertained by a young Tom Sizemore in a small cameo role.  Also, you'll get to experience classic Keannu Reeves lines, such as: ""I am an FBI agent"" delivered only the way Keannu Reeves can.",1386806400,,2458,4.688524590163935

444428,4,6302256615,"Actions films aren't really serious cinema, any more than westerns and romances are serious literature. I'm not knocking any of them, just saying that the genres in general demand such titillation that they crowd out that other stuff like drawing the audience's empathy through setting a believable stage for the tale. Some action films, like the first Die Hard, are well-written enough to rise about their genre. Point Break doesn't. That said, it's still a lot more fun than a generic action flick, since there's so much love in it. It's one of the best of the 80s and 90s action movies, full of the kind of creativity and fun that distinguish it from the far more soulless action movies we get nowadays.

The film continues the proud tradition of cheap 80s action movies -- the so-broad-it's-vague title, the poorly paired law officers who learn to appreciate each other, the surly boss, the charmingly fake blood -- and mixes in one vital element that keeps the whole thing fresh: an obsession with surfing. It's not just about surfers, it's about Keanu Reeves' special agent Johnny Utah unexpectedly gaining a love of surfing while tracking down bank-robbing surfers just as obsessed with it, ending as he quits the force. Scenic shots of the surf start the film, end the film, and show up a ton in between: we're meant to love surfing just as much as our heroes. Since the film gives itself over so much to Patrick Swayze's character's notions of surfing as a way of life, it's possible for a viewer to get just as swept up.

The supporting actors give the movie a lot, too: Gary Busey is cranky and unhealthy as Utah's partner, and John C. McGinley makes a particularly sarcastic surly boss. Lori Petty has an entertaining voice. The sense of fun about the film is inherent in the script, with a scene where Keanu gets a sandwich while on a stakeout and manages to miss a bank robbery looking like something out of a straight comedy. I was further amused that the fact that one of the bank robbers enjoys mooning people turned out to be a major plot point, played for drama. Add the sky diving and the fact that the robbers use rubbery caricatured masks of formers presidents and call themselves ""the Ex-Presidents,"" and you have a quirky, genre-bending action-thriller-extreme sports film. It might not be timeless, but if you enjoy action films, it's up there.",1371772800,,2369,4.733656174334141

Every decade has a few films that define that age. Star Wars. Rocky. E.T. Point Break is such a film. An adrenaline filled, testosterone soaked action classic, Point Break came out during that small window in the early 90s when Gen-X came onto the scene.

Keanu 'whoa' Reves is Johnny Utah, football player turned FBI agent who is as much a seeker as he is an investigator. Gary Busey of Lethal Weapon fame plays Reves' partner. Patrick Swayze is Bodhi, surfer-bank robber-philosopher who leads his own tribe of lost boys in robbing banks to finance their endless summer. There's a lot of discussion in this film about life, choices and what it means to be free. The surfer sub-culture is given a fair amount of respect. All of which raise the film above the standard action fair.

Car chases,foot chases, parachuting and of course...surfing. All wonderfully directed by Katheryn Bigelow.

The script has lots of quotable dialogue.

'You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta' go down.

'If you want the ultimate, you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price. It's not tragic to die doing what you love.'

'Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.'

I could go on.

There was talk a few years back about a sequel. That won't happen now that Patrick Swayze has passed away.

Pity.

All in all, a very cool movie. See it if you haven't.

And if you have, see it again.",1362700800,3,1629,5.152091254752852

Patrick Swayze is the cool head surfer/ spiritual leader, Lori Petty is great as the love interest, and Gary Busey is great as crazy Gary Busey.

As for the Blu-Ray experience, the movie goes straight to the Blu-Ray menus (no un-skippable previews and you can skip each opening logo sequences by hitting 'next chapter'). The picture quality itself is nice, but definitely not up to par with the Blu Rays of today (which is to be expected from a 20-year-old film). There are some noticeable flaws in the audio when turned up loud as well. Bonus features are limited, being only one disc, but include all the standard ones (deleted scenes, behind the story, theatrical trailer) and definitely add more value to the purchase. The Blu-Ray box used is one of those environmentally-friendly boxes with the recycle logo cut out of the plastic on the inside; this isn't a problem for most people but for me it feels really cheap when I pick it up, so I used one of my empty backup Blu-Ray cases for it instead of the included one.

It only misses if you, mistakenly, expect Keanu Reeves to be a great actor. So stop that. You know better, so enjoy the film.

Everyone else in the film does a *great* job, and that includes Gary Busey and John C McGinley (who chews the scenery *wonderfully* -- I'm sure he was asked to do so). Patrick Swayze outshines the rest of the cast, but that's partly because he has the most interesting role.

With that said; `Point Break' has some serious flaws (namely, the horrendous acting) that take it down a notch.  It is still well worth watching, and I'd totally watch it again, but I can't say that this is great.

I mean, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey AND John C. McGinley in the SAME MOVIE.  Talk about the trifecta of horrendously bad acting.  They even share scenes together.  When the three of them unite it's like the world stops spinning and all the heads of those listening to them force emotion explode in unison.

Like, totally dude!

It's sad when the most reputable actor in your cast is Patrick Swayze, a mediocre talent at best.  In fact, this film's `acting' is saved by the little known Lori Petty, who just sizzles as the spunky Tyler.

Back to the film itself.

`Point Break' centers on Johnny Utah, a young cop recently assigned to the Bank Robbery division of his LAPD.  Soon he gets sucked in, by his partner Pappas, to go undercover as a surfer to catch a gang of notorious bank robbers called The Ex-Presidents.  They've robbed a ton of banks in three years' time and have never been caught.  They're too smart for that.  Pappas is convinced they have to be surfers thanks to one of the culprit's tan-lines and some wax he found scuffed on a bank counter.  Johnny now has to acquaint himself with the surfer crowd, which comes easier than he expected thanks to a hot young thing and her ex-beau.  Johnny soon finds himself getting caught up in the mentality of the surfer crowd, that of a spiritual connection to the sea, but as he closes in on The Ex-Presidents he becomes torn between his old life and the new one he just started.

Keanu Reeves is one of those actors who tries way to hard.  I love how Petty's character Tyler calls Johnny (Reeves) out for looking so serious all the time.  That is Keanu in a nutshell.  He looks so serious, but he sounds so goofy.  He can't deliver his lines with any real conviction.  It doesn't help that he's saddled with some terrible dialog (""You have to go down!"").  Busey has been reduced to a joke in recent years, but apparently he was a decent actor in the 80's, or at least he was that one time when he received an Academy award nomination for playing Buddy Holly.  Outside of that, he rarely receives much praise.  In fact, the best thing he does in this film is punch John C. McGinley in the face (something I've wanted to do for years) so, yay for him.  McGinley is a horrific actor who has one gimmick he overuses to no end.  It was funny the first three times I watched `Scrubs'.  It's not funny anymore and yet he can't stop doing in.  I didn't realize he did it with every character he plays.  Those long running monologues with minor vocal fluctuations without taking a single breath just aren't effective; at all.

UGH, but poor acting choices can't take away from the adrenaline rush that comes from this slickly directed film; and the brilliant cinematography (equal parts sun, sand, water and hair) make for a captivating ride.  Like I said, I will TOTALLY watch this again but to say that this is a great movie would be a stretch.",1315267200,4,3413,4.531914893617022
444567,5,6302256615,"A classic macho action-fest with a heart of gold.

I got the blu-ray and I enjoyed this movie on an emotional level I never have before, since I never saw it in the theaters, only on DVD. This is so much more alive. There's something about movies that were shot on film, with loving attention to cinematography. This dumb action movie is actually one of them. Really fun to watch. It's actually not that dumb. Well, lots of it is dumb, but in a very entertaining way. Anyway, back to the blu ray - It's a well-done transfer that seems true to the film. Clean too. No dirt or crud. No enhancement either, that I can tell. There's some grainy footage but it's mostly low-light out on the water, low ISO film, I believe, so the grain is part of the film, seemingly. Parts of the movie are absolutely creamy. Sometimes it's almost spooky.

as a side note, I have read Video professionals talk about this - most TV's are set too cool and bright out of the box, with gamma and contrast jacked up. Try adjusting your set, setting your TV to a warmer picture will look too warm for a few seconds but pretty soon you will forget that, and it will really look better playing good films. My TV has a ""movie mode"" and I never used it because it wasn't bright and contrasty enough and seemed too warm, reddish, but now I'm hooked on it.

444570,4,6302256615,"Point Break Blu-ray Review

Distributor : 20th Century Fox

This US Blu-ray is in fact one of the main contributing factors behind my investing in a multi region Blu-ray player, as unfortunately it being a 20th Century Fox release, this one is region locked to A.

There is a Blu-ray available in Spain of this movie, but that one is presented in1080i and has lip sinc issues on the English audio track, making it one to avoid for English speaking collectors. This US release however, is presented with a 2.35:1 1080p transfer which really looks quite strong with decent colours and black levels throughout. The image quality is sharp and considering the age of the film, is more than likely the best that this film will ever look. It is certainly fair to say that the transfer is a noticeable improvement over the DVD releases, especially over the original first DVD release, which is still the only option currently available in the UK as the newer Pure Adrenaline Edition has never been made available over here on any format.

As this is the US disc, the film itself is also uncut, unlike the original UK release, which had some edits to some of the more violent scenes.

The audio on this Blu-ray is strong and impressive. Offering a lossless DTS HD track which again is a world away from the audio presented on the DVDs. Sound is crisp and clear throughout, whether you are listening to the slower dialogue scenes or the many louder action sequences.

As far as extra features are concerned, there are approx 4 featurettes, some theatrical trailers and a hand full of deleted scenes. Nothing to get too excited about, but at least there is something included here for fans of movie extras.

All things considered this is a worthwhile Blu-ray release. If you are a long time fan of the film, you will definitely appreciate the higher quality transfer and audio presented here. Quite why this hasn't made a UK release yet is anyone's guess, however with multi region Blu-ray players available these days from as little as 60, this US disc could just be one of a number of reasons to convert you over to multi region player freedom.

Definitely a movie of it's time and still just as enjoyable to this day. Point Break on Blu-ray comes highly recommended.

""IF YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE RUSH, YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE.""

Thankfully, that doesn't apply to the cost of this Blu-ray disc, which can be found reasonably cost effectively, from most on-line suppliers.

444571,4,6302256615,"The greatest movie ever made! Seriously, yes. No, I'm kidding. But, no, seriously. If you disagree all I can say is ""Back off Warchild, seriously."" Point Break was the the Starship Troopers of its era - which is another contender for best movie ever made - and brought together a disparate collection of unique treasures never to be assembled again, including:
- A performance by Keanu Reeves so memorable that he was subsequently cast as Don John in Brannagh's Much Ado About Nothing.
- The appearance of 'Craziest Person in the World' Gary Busey, who was voluntarily cast by Kathryn Bigelow whereas normally there's an agency clause or losing poker hand responsible for his appearance.
- John C McGinley playing John C McGinley, practicing for his role in Scrubs as John C McGinley.
- A range of such deliriously rich dialog that you can go through your entire life using only quotes from the movie and still manage to survive on the food Gary Busy orders.

The plot is possibly the most implausible in the history of an industry famed for implausible plots. I've even seen Catwoman and nothing comes close to the concept of this: ""Surfers rob banks to pay for surfing."" Hmmm, why? We don't know. How do we they're good? Because - and remember this if you ever decide to take more than the free candy at Wells Fargo - they don't go for the vault and they don't kill anybody. For some reason the FBI gets involved, and if you've ever been tempted by a career in law enforcement let me tell you the FBI pays for surfing lessons while you shack up with Lori Petti.

Anyway, Keanu - a name that I've never come across in real life, though I've met plenty of Summers and Rainbows - infiltrates the surfer dude gang by acting like a surfer dude. Well, not really acting but you get it. There's a point that comes dangerously close to science where they figure out the chemical composition of something left behind at a scene and determine that it's used on surfboards and ergo that the robbers must be a gang of surfers. I used this logic to conclude that the previous owner of my car worked in McDonald's when I found a 2-year old French fry under the spare tire. Keanu eventually gets caught in his duplicity by leaving his wallet around and instead of hiding his badge somewhere behind his Safeway and Costco cards, it's sat there with big three letters ""F-B-I"".

There's some inspiring political stuff about ""fighting the system"" and showing people ""inching their way down the freeway in their metal coffins"", and that it's all about the ride. The whole thing is like Venice Beach with a brain, but thankfully doesn't last very long before we're back to jumping out of airplanes. Swayze is excellent as always and I'm sure his spirit looks down on the nightly Point Break LIVE! in LA, where audience members are cast as Johnny Utah. I wish I had a state as a last name, as long as that state wasn't New Hampshire.

The finale will have you clenched on the sofa, with your brain rocking back and forth in your skull trying to make it stop: Bells Beach (Australia) - where Swayze is going for a suicidal surf into the biggest wave in history. The Australian police have terrible accents but maybe that's just Bells Beach where they happen to sound like American actors who don't know the difference between English and Australian accents, 'mate'. Keep a box of tissues handy since Bodhi's not ""paddling to New Zealand"" (at least not from Malibu).

In conclusion, ""22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot during that time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean."" So true, Gary Busey. So true.",1284249600,8,3589,4.592823712948518

444605,5,6302256615,"Having recently purchased a HD TV, i knew it was only a matter of time before i bought a Blu-Ray player as well. Sure enough, a week after buying the TV, i splashed out the cash for a Blu-Ray machine. That was the easy part.

Looking at the newly released Blu-Ray titles, and the significant price difference between a regular DVD and the movie on Blu-Ray, i began to look through titles i already owned on DVD and what i thought would deserve an upgrade in picture quality and sound. Without much hesitation, Point Break sprung to mind.

I'm not going to review the actual movie. That's already been covered many times over. But assuming you've already seen the movie, this is more about what to expect from the HD version, as opposed to the regular DVD copy.

Well, the film looks FANTASTIC. You have to bear in mind that the film came out in 1991. Granted, that's not that long ago. But in terms of how technology has evolved over the past 20 years, it's a long time. For the surfing scenes, the waves are so much clearer, and the sound really does make you believe you're in the surf too. For the skydiving scenes, the aerial footage is amazingly sharp. When i first saw the movie in theatres, i was blown away by the water and air shots. Buying it on VHS, then DVD, and now Blu-Ray, i can honestly say the movie just keeps on getting more and more enjoyable. I've been a fan of Mark Isham (music composer for this film, and many others) and his score is brought vividly to life on this HD format.

Extras wise, it's the same as the DVD re-release a few years back (Adrenaline edition). A few deleted scenes, 4 new featurettes featuring interviews with the late Swayze and 2 of the surfing gang, plus John C McGinley and an entertaining Gary Busey).

Yes, it's a bit cheesy at times, being as it was made around the late eighties, but Point Break is one of those movies with a deep message.  An undercover agent infiltrates a group of bank robbing adrenaline junky surfers.  Initially his motivation was to bust them, obviously.  But after he gets to know them a bit he realizes that there's beauty in their life, and starts living it firsthand as well; they rejected a corrupt society, technology and the 9 to 5 blue money world, in preference of a life of surfing, skydiving, and partying instead.  And who can blame them?  There truly is quite a bit of beauty in that.  But inevitably problems begin occurring, after all some bird's feathers are too colorful to be caged, as the saying goes, and things go south quite quickly.  That's probably all I can say without ruining the movie.  One of my favorites, Point Break is definitely worth seeing.",1267142400,,986,4.6531791907514455

The 1st & biggest problem in my view is where are they? Oh sure, the script says Southern California, but I lived in SoCal for over 25 years (I was living there when this was released to theatres) & I can tell you that there are NO beaches like that anywhere in California. The waves are large & tubular. There are very few surfers on them. The sand is empty of onlookers. There is vegetation nearly to the water. The movie supposedly takes place during August & September (the hottest months in SoCal), yet the surfers are all wearing wetsuits. Trust me, NO surfers would wear wetsuits at that time of year.

Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) lives on the beach in a rather large cottage. With no neighbors. Assuming (as a bank robber) he could afford a beach house, believe me, there are simply no isolated 'shacks' anywhere in SoCal. Another 'little' detail gone wrong.

It was nice seeing Anthony Keidis (lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) in a cameo role as a hot-headed surf nazi beating up on Keanu Reeves' character, but Keanu himself runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.

One thing to note is that this is 2.35:1 widescreen, which is what was shown in theaters. However, since it was shot on non-anamorphic Super 35, it's vertically cropped from the 4:3 TV/VHS version, so although you are seeing what you would have seen in theaters (and I'm guessing what was on the DVD release), and you are seeing a little bit more on the sides, you might notice that the frame is cropped from your VHS copy.

the performances are actually really well done. patrick swayze seemed to especially lose himself in the roll and from what i've heard is or was an actuall adrenaline junkie at that time any way. he really does come off as some sort of surf guru by day/criminal at night type jeckyl and hyde character. gary busey is always way out there and is a fun sidekick for the dumb-as-rocks keanu to play off of. on that note, i never liked reeves acting. even in parenthood where he was supposed to play a bumbling retard, i was still disgusted by his lack of creativity toward such a stereotypical character. in point break he is supposed to be ice cool as SECRET AGENT JOHNNY UTAH! who has a monumental epiphony when he goes on a ""stealth mission"", or to us land-dwellers, night surfing that is. this special moment is realized when lori petty's character caresses his face and claims he looks like he's...well, it's such an enlightening moment i don't want to spoil anything. in reality it looks like he just got hit over the head with a surf board. which seems to be the case, stealth mission or unstealth mission.
the action moves along nicely. the movie never takes itself too seriously, even when minor characters drop like flies (you pretty much forget busey gets blasted with a shotgun to the back) the film never cuts to a crying in the rain type scene set to lonely piano keys. the bank robberies are fast and fun. the beach house parties are wild. the free fall scene is very well done and believable all the way through (you don't even question wether or not you can have a conversation while plummeting to the earth at a couple hundred miles mph).
mike nelson of mst3k and rifftrax shares my dislike for mr. reeves and if you do as well i highly suggest downloading the comedy commentary from rifftrax.com to properly enjoy this classic action flick!

The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.

This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.",1182470400,2,1076,4.569948186528498

444690,4,6302256615,"Generally panned by critics upon its release, Point Break has gone on to enjoy something of a minor cult following among action film fans who enjoy its breathlessly choreographed action sequences involving daring bank heists, car chases, skydiving and, of course, surfing - one of the film's most important selling points. The film came along after Patrick Swayze's phenomenal success with Ghost and he went completely in the opposite direction with this film. Point Break also proved to be a warm-up for Keanu Reeves who would become a full-fledged action hero with Speed a few years later.

Point Break trots out and downright revels in stereotypes: Utah is the all-American good guy, Pappas is the burn out cop and they are constantly being chewed out by their jerk-off boss (McGinley) for their screwball antics. Surprisingly, it's Swayze's Zen master/surfer/bank robber that doesn't fall into an easy stereotype and comes across as the most interesting, charismatic character in the entire movie. And you have to give the credit to Swayze and his oddly fascinating performance. There is a nice scene where he tells Utah his philosophy of surfing, ""It's a state of mind. It's that place where you lose yourself and find yourself."" We find ourselves rooting not for Reeves' bland FBI agent but Swayze's thrillseeking surfer.

Point Break is the epitome of a guilty pleasure: to dumb to defend rationally but with action sequences too cool to dismiss totally. It's a big, loud comic book of a movie and it knows it and has the conviction to go for it. But is it worth purchasing on DVD if you already own a copy?

First up are eight deleted scenes that include more footage of Utah trying to surf. We also see him get more grief from his boss for his undercover work. There are other little bits of excised footage that doesn't really amount to all that much.

""It's Make or Break"" is a retrospective featurette. Busey, Petty and Swayze all contribute new interviews for this DVD and talk about their experiences making the movie.

""Ride the Wave"" examines the spirituality of surfing. The ocean is a double-edged sword - at once very beautiful but also very dangerous. This extra also takes a brief look at the surfer culture.

""Adrenaline Junkies"" examines the exciting stunts staged in the movie. Like his character, Swayze was into skydiving but the studio did not want him to do it. However, if you look at the first skydiving sequence, he really jumped out of the plane!

""On Location: Malibu"" is a more light-hearted extra as two of the Ex-Presidents (who were actual surfers) John Philbin and Bojesse Christopher take us on a mini-tour of key locations in Malibu used in the movie. They crack jokes and reminisce about key scenes.

Also included are three trailers and a behind-the-scenes stills gallery.",1161043200,138,2814,4.897058823529412

The story revolves around special agent Johnny Utah (Reeves) and his veteran partner (Busey) on the trail of a group of bank robbers who wear masks of ex-presidents. Soon enough, Reeves infiltrates a group of surfers (led by Swayze) who turn out to be linked to the robbers. The performances are great, especially Swayze who gives one of his last high profile film performances before his career began to decline. The fantasticly shot skydiving and surfing sequences are worth the price of admission alone, and Bigelow manages to nicely orchestrate some great action scenes.

A gang of Southern California surfers tear up the waves, while enjoying the sun, sand and the sea. But in their spare time they also double up as Bank robbers and commit their crimes masked as American presidents. The gang led by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze)have been making some serious hits.

Finally the law in the form of FBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) and his partner, Pappas (Gary Busey)suspect the sand lovers and decide to infiltrate them by going undercover.

Throw in skydiving, some pretty boy male bonding action and a little bit of love into this cocktail, this turns out to be a pretty decent film. The acting is saved with good pacing and a commendable script; which is not as predictable as 1 might think.

It's worth a watch, definetly!!!

444720,4,6302256615,"A few months ago, a favorite sports writer of  mine (Bill Simmons, AKA the Sports Guy of ESPN.com fame) was lamenting the lack of rewatchable movies coming out of Hollywood over the past  half-decade, and comparing the recent paucity to the abundance of such movies in the 1980's and '90's.  While I'm about ten years younger than the Sports Guy and not given to nostalgia anyway, it wasn't hard for me to see his point. Which brings me to Point Break, one of the quintessential rewatchable movies of the past 20 years.  If I'm flipping through channels and I come to this movie, unless there's a Celtics or Patriots playoff game on, I'm watching.  Period.  It doesn't matter that basic cable is bound to edit some of the best parts, or that I've seen the movie about 15 times already and own the DVD, or that my wife may become even more convinced of my profound patheticness.  I simply can't not watch Point Break if it's on, which can be said about very few movies indeed.  In fact, if I were to create a list of the top ten guy movies I've seen in my life, it would go something like the following:

1. Goodfellas

2. Road House

3. Commando

4. True Romance

5. Fight Club

6. Heat

7. The Terminator

8. Sin City

9. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels

10. Swingers

However, if were to make a list of the top ELEVEN guy movies I've seen in my lifetime, it's a safe bet that Point Break would sneak onto that list.  Released just before the mid-90's surge of super-advanced special effects that yielded such super-terrible movies as Twister, Independence Day, and pretty much anything involving Jerry Bruckheimer, Point Break is nothing short of B-movie heaven, with all the familiar trappings thereof: rampant overacting, testosterone-laden dialogue, a series of highly implausible occurrences, and men determined to resolve everything with violence.  It's fast-paced, deliriously stupid, and just suspenseful enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

At the same time, Point Break succeeds because its heart is always in the right place.  Sure, it doesn't have the huge budget and nifty effects that characterized so many of the Hollywood blockbuster released in the past decade or so, but Point Break did manage to boast a plot and characters that were at least somewhat believable and well-developed, to go with lots of skillful direction from Kathryn Bigelow.  And, of course, you get one completely iconic line from Keanu Reeves: ""I am an EFF-BEE-EYE Agent!"".  His career was all downhill from that one, let me tell you.

Even the name of the hero is likably improbable:  Johnny Utah (!), played in slightly-less-wooden-than-usual fashion by Keanu Reeves in his pre-Speed days.  At the start of the movie, Johhny is a strait-laced FBI rookie and ex-college football star who gets an assignment to the Bureau's robbery unit in the criminal hotbed of LA.  Providing the yin to Johhny's yang (or maybe it's the other way around) is Patrick Swayze's Bodhi (""They call him Bodha-Zeffa""), a walking bundle of contradictions: a laid-back surfer dude and martial-arts expert who spouts heavy philosophy when he's not leading his gang of ex-president-mask-wearing adrenaline-junkie bank robbers on heists to finance their globetrotting adventures.

Naturally, the two are put on a collision course when Johnny and his grizzled partner Angelo Pappas (the great Gary Busey) are assigned to bringing down the ex-presidents and Johnny starts frequenting the local beaches in the guise of a novice surfer.  It's not long before Bodhi and co. (who turn out to be quite fervent college-football fans for a bunch of slacking surfers) take Johnny under their collective wing and introduce him to their thrill-seeking, anti-mainstream worldview.  And it's also not long before Johnny loosens up, falls for a surfer chick, and begins to sympathize with his new criminal buddies.  That's just the bare bones of the plot though; you also get:

-A couple of showdowns with a group of local surf Nazis with names like Bunker and Warchild (one of them played by Anthony Kiedis, who turned out to be a decent actor when he wasn't putting out mediocre albums with the Red Hot Chili Peppers).

-Shootouts, fistfights, chases, a gratuitous car explosion, surfing, and skydiving: everything you could want in an action movie, and more!

-One of our finest actors (John C. McGinley of Office Space, Platoon, and tons of other movies) as Harp, Johnny's tightly wound and often-screaming FBI supervisor, who's had it with Johnny and Angelo's wild antics and lack of results and isn't afraid to show it.

-One of movie history's great bank heist scenes towards the end.  Is there a movie that wouldn't benefit from a tense, closely-filmed robbery sequence with an impending sense of doom, the kind where you know something is going to go wrong and people (both innocent and otherwise) are going to die?  Granted, you don't quite get anything on par with the legendary downtown-LA shootout from Heat, but I was impressed nonetheless.

And, yeah, that's pretty much it.  Point Break is not by any means a great movie, but it is a pretty good one, I think, and essential for enthusiasts of mid-budget action flicks.  Sadly, it seems Hollywood isn't churning out movies like this one with anywhere near the regularity it once was, but Point Break should be appreciated all the more for that fact.",1137801600,3,5377,4.9091915836101885
444721,5,6302256615,"Point Break is not only a truly great action movie, but it is a realisation of everything a truly great movie should be in general. Johnny Utah is a new FBI agent fresh out of Quantico, ready for some action. He's ""young, dumb, and full of cum"", as his new FBI department chief Harp puts it so elegantly. Utah is teamed up with Agent Angelo Pappas, a genial, no-BS 19-year veteran of the Bureau who knows everything his bosses don't know about doing the job, not by the book, but the best way. Their boss, Agent Harp, doesn't like that, and doesn't much like anything else about Pappas, either, which soon becomes apparent to Utah. On their first case together, Utah and Pappas investigate the most recent bank robbery in L.A. by the notorious ""Dead Presidents"", a gang of four bank robbers who don masks of Reagan, Carter, Johnson and Nixon during their armed capers. Utah then learns Pappas' theory regarding the Dead Presidents: ""The Dead Presidents....are SURFERS."" Maybe not a revelation of historic significance at first to Utah, but this small detail is what makes the film so compelling, in the end, the stuff that is the meat of the action; the story revolves around the world of surfing, with all the tremendous beauty and power of the ocean, the concurrent mysticism and physicality of the sport, and the language, culture, and traditions of its adherents. Utah quickly makes friends with a local surfer girl, Tyler (Lori Petty), as a way to gain entry into the surfing clique, who teaches him some of the basics of the sport. It turns out that Tyler is a friend of surfing legend and spiritual guru Bodhi (Patrick Swayze, in a tour de force performance), who not only sees his sport as a pathway to enlightenment, but sees life itself as a higher calling to be experienced to the pinnacle of every activity. Bodhi quickly sees the ""kamikaze look"" in Utah, who he recognizes as the former All-Big Ten quarterback from Ohio State. They are kindred spirits. Bodhi brings Utah under his wing, initially unaware that Utah is an FBI agent, and they set out as part of Bodhi's surfer-cum-extraordinary gentleman's club on various daredevil adrenaline trips such as skydiving into the sea, surfing at dusk and wild beach parties. All this is great, for sure, except Utah eventually realizes that his new best friend is actually the head of the Dead Presidents. That's when things really heat up. First is a seat-of-your-pants chase through what looks like South Central L.A. after Utah and Pappas break up the Presidents' latest bank heist. As the truth comes out, Bodhi controls Utah by threatening Tyler, who it turns out is Bodhi's former girlfriend, but who Utah is now in love with. When Tyler is kidnapped by Bodhi's gang, Utah is forced to become one of the Dead Presidents. Utah robs a bank with them, bystanders get killed--knocking it up to murder one--and then they end up in Mexico, where Tyler is finally freed--but not before Bodhi makes a dramatic getaway. The only clue Utah still has is that Bodhi must eventually get to Australia's Bell's Beach within a year to fulfill his spiritual destiny and catch the 50-Year Storm, a weather pattern which yields 200-ft high waves and the penultimate challenge for big-wave surfers. It seems that at least one of our two protagonists, Bodhi or Utah, will not survive and walk away from this storm. But that is part of the beauty of it all, is it not? Point Break is just about the most compelling action film you could ever wish for, especially if you are one of those coinosseurs who demands that a movie is both pretty to look at but also philosophically profound. Patrick Swayze's Bodhi brings a new meaning to the concept of hero-villain, by also making him somewhat of a prophet or seer at the same time. There's no doubt that you'll like what you see here. In addition to stunning surfing photography, the film achieves a certain zen flow which builds up to a definite crescendo towards the end. It's not enough for Bodhi to achieve greatness, on the ocean and in the mind, he must transcend our soul-robbing society and the law itself, and ultimately conquer death. He'll either succeed or fail, and obviously perhaps die trying, but either way, Point Break looks really good.",1136505600,11,4244,4.752032520325203
444732,3,6302256615,"The other day I decided to pop in my DVD copy of Point Break, the movie that I believe was Keanu Reeves's coming out party as the worst actor of our generation. True, more people may know him from the two Bill & Ted movies, and now from the Matrix, but Point Break was his real breakout role. In Bill & Ted, Keanu plays an idiot; i.e. he plays himself. The real comedy comes when he tries to act in serious roles, beginning with his star turn opposite Patrick Swayze in Point Break.

There is no getting past the hilarity in a preposterous movie that tries to take itself seriously. Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a Midwestern boy two years removed from leading his college football team to the Rose Bowl as the star quarterback. He has just set foot in Los Angeles to begin a career in the FBI unit that investigates bank robberies. He is assigned to partner with 20 year veteran Angelo Pappas, who is annoyed to be ""babysitting some quarterback punk."" Pappas is played by the immortal Gary Busey.

When you cast Keanu and Gary Busey, you already know that the movie is going to be ridiculous. Gary Busey is known as That Guy who was the bad guy in Under Siege, the crazy army guy in Black Sheep, the aging Cubs pitcher who dates Henry Roengarter's mom in Rookie of the Year, and also formerly known as That Guy who looks like Nick Nolte, although now I would say he is more famous and more entertaining than Nolte. Busey has gone from ""That Guy"" status to ""Caricature of Himself"" status, and to completely do him justice, he would need his own column.

Before moving on, we need some Gary Busey quotes from this movie:

""When they run they dump the vehicle and they vanish... like a virgin on prom night. I mean they vanish, swishh...""

""Listen you snot-nose little [poop], I was takin' shrapnel in Khe Sanh when you were crappin' in your hands and rubbin' it on your face.""

""22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot during that time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.""

""Let me tell you something, Harp. I was in this bureau while you were still popping zits on your funny face and [blank] off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalog.""

""I'm so hungry I could eat the [butt] end out of a dead rhino, I should have had you get me three of these things!""

Anyways, there is a group of bank robbers called the ex-presidents. Gary Busey thinks that they are surfers, since they only rob during the summer months, and one of the guys mooned the security camera during their last robbery, and he has a surfers tan. So, Keanu goes undercover and heads for the beach, to learn to surf and try to get in with the surfer dudes, with the hope of finding the bank robber gang. Of course, there is a girl (That Girl who plays the younger sister in A League of Their Own) who teaches Keanu how to surf, but more importantly, become the token romantic interest who of course has a tie-in to the bad guys.

Or, are they bad guys? We meet a band of surfers, with the leader a dude named Bodhi, played by Mr. Dirty Dancing himself, Patrick Swayze, with a little facial stubble and blond curls. There is the requisite male bonding between Keanu and Bodhi, mystical bull about being one with the waves, and the movie forgets that it is starring Keanu Reeves, and tries to be deep with Bodhi (after we find out-as if we didn't know-that he and his buddies are the Ex-Presidents) giving a speech about how corporate America is the real bad guy, and they are the ones who are really living life by being rebels, searching out the next wave, and blah blah blah.

It won't be giving anything away to say that Bodhi and his boys find out that Keanu is an undercover cop, so they take him along for sky-diving (cue cheap symbolism) and let him join in with the Ex-Presidents on their next robbery; a rush Keanu won't pass on since Bodhi has the girlfriend under captive somewhere else. Things go bad during the robbery, and Bodhi and his two surviving bodacious dudes are on the run, with Keanu and Gary Busey on the trail. Busey (the real star, in my opinion, not only of this movie, but of every movie he graces his over caffeinated [over-coked?] self in) gets killed as Keanu won't allow him to shoot Bodhi, since he knows Bodhi must be kept free until the girlfriend is found. We have another skydiving scene, this time with Keanu not using the brain he doesn't have and jumping out of the plane without a parachute and catching onto Bodhi. We have reached our climatic moment-will Keanu, holding onto Bodhi, drop his gun and pull the parachute string at the last minute? A good movie might have allowed us to doubt what would happen.

Bodhi goes on his way, and releases the girl to Keanu. The movie can't end here, though. We have to jump ahead 6 months to an approaching tsunami in Australia. Bodhi is ready to ride the wave of the century, and Keanu arrives on the scene to arrest him. Keanu cements his place as the worst actor of our generation with lines such as ""You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta go down"" and THE line that shows Keanu's (limited) acting rang and (sadly) his jump into stardom, ""I'm an EFF BEE EYE agent!"" Will Keanu arrest Bodhi and bring him in, or let him have his one shot riding the wave of the century? Once again, this movie leaves no doubt.

Point Break was terrible, yet very entertaining. Like the ghettho-ized Bad News Bears rip-off Hardball, and the so bad and clichd its unintentionally funny The Replacements, Keanu Reeves always manages to make movie-going quite an experience. I'd like to say to you, Keanu, and I think I speak for many, vaya con dios, bro.

And what a pairing it was!

  Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen are in this film.  Who has yet to have their face almost put into a lawnmower or chased a surfin ""Ronald Reagan""?  No one because Point Break is a one of a kind original!  This movie also has some very funny and smart dialogue which most action films lack.

444737,5,6302256615,"Growing up in the streets of Detroit, Michigan, I can totally relate to this action packed movie that deals with surfing and robbing banks.  I have been surfing the waves of Lake Superior, Lake St. Clair, and The Detroit River my whole life and am yet to see as realistic of surfing scenes as those portrayed in the film Point Break.  This may be the best cast ever assembled on the movie screen featuring Patrick Swayze (Bodhizapta) and my personal favorite/hero Keanu Reeves (Special Agent Johnny Utah).  This is Reeves at his best, blowing away his performance in the Matrix and Sweet November.  The story takes place on the beaches of Southern California where a group of surfers have been ripping off banks dressed as the ""Ex-Presidents"" in order to fund their ""Endless Summer.""  Special Agent John Utah, freshly out of the Academy, hooks up with Special Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) to identify the ex-presidents and end the serial bank robberies taking place before the criminals take refuge out of the country searching for the ultimate ride.  So you may ask, ""what's the biggest?""  The answer is simple, ""Bell's Beach Australia.""  You see there is a fifty years storm that starts swelling up in the artic regions and makes its way to Bell's Beach, Australia.  Just remember one thing ""If you want the ultimate, you have to be willing to pay the ultimate price.  It is not tragic to die doing something you love.""

This 1991 movie starring up and coming Keanu Reeves as Special Agent Johnny Utah wanting to make name by solving a series of bank robberies in L.A.
Johnny goes under cover and meets up with a sexy surfer
(Lori Petti)who teaches him the basics and introduces him to surf guru Bodhi (Partick Swayze)
They become best friends and Johnny overlooks the possibility that his new friend could be the leader and brain behind the bank robberies.
With plenty of surfing, sky diving and chases, this makes it one of Reeves's most understated movies yet.

A thread of good against evil is present through out the story, and Johnny's choices to take the right decisions are ever evident.

Good entertainment. A surf movie that actually has some dialogue!",1116374400,2,846,4.780821917808219
444739,4,6302256615,"Why do people slag off Keanu in this movie? Sure, slag off Patrick all you want, cos he was ruined after he did Dirty Dancing - he cannot top that movie! Both stars do spend a lot of time topless, although a lot has to be said for Keanu's lines in this - they are so quotable, even I can quote them, and that's saying something.

Some of the scenes are absolutely amazing, particularly some of the final scenes, and the sky-diving scene is breath-taking & scary at the same time. I was disappointed when I watched one of the featurettes on this DVD, to find out how exactly it was done!!! And here's little naive me thinking it was actually done for real. Although Patrick did actually do some jumps himself, fighting with the insurance people, so he could actually do it.

I also loved the simplicity of one of the first scenes, where Keanu's suited & booted, and going through the various corridors. It's so simple, yet it looks like it's done in one take. I also love the chase scene between Keanu's character, Johnny Utah, and the main bank robber. It's one of the most adrenaline packed scenes in this movie, and will have you on the edge of your seat.

I love Keanu in this, I thought Patrick was excellent, one actress/character I did not like was Lori Petty. (Oh my God, how much she's changed in 14 years!) I didn't mind her before, but for some reason, I've suddenly noticed how similar Keanu & Lori looked (then), and it gave me the creeps. I don't know why, they were just too similar looking to be playing lovers in this movie. It's almost incestuous! Of course, there needed to be a female lead, since Johnny is aptly described as being ""young, dumb and full of cum"". But I think they could have chosen a better lead than her to be honest.

The finale of this movie will leave you exhausted afterwards, as the film packs a lot in. I thought some of the scenes, particularly the surfing & sky-diving scenes could have been done by stunt doubles, as Bodhi (Patrick) looks completely different when he's surfing. Keanu, who learned to surf for his role still surfs as a hobby to this day. I've said about the final sequence before that I didn't like it, but after rewatching it, I do think it does the film justice, and finishes it off nicely.

There are two deleted scenes that appear in the trailer, but not actually in the movie itself. Which is a shame! Bodhi and Utah are in Bodhi's truck and Utah is shooting with a gun on the left side. Bodhi is saying ""This is gonna be a great day, Johnny"". Also, Utah meets Harp at his office with his surfboard. Harp is angry and saying ""You are not here to pick up girls, Utah"". Utah says back ""The original term is BABES, sir!""

If you're not American, or don't know your history, like me, you'll have no idea who the ex-presidents are, apart from Richard Nixon. The other two are Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, although I'm at a loss to who the fourth is.

There's a body count of 12 in this, and there's no holds barred, particularly since I was expecting there to be some extra bits added in, with my previous viewing experience being on TV. There's lots of gory shots, including some guy getting shot in the foot, Keanu getting rather too close for my liking (and probably his too) to a lawnmower, and a girl beating him up naked. Which I'm sure he enjoyed!

Nearly all the stars of the movie appear again to talk in the featurettes, apart from Keanu (really disappointing!) Gary Busey is looking old, as is Lori Petty - shaved head and all, and I'm NOT talking about Gary!!! It's interesting to find out that Anthony from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers actually appears in this (never realised it was him before), and wouldn't turn up for fight rehearsals, so got knocked out straight away!!! Hahahaha!!! (He's the long haired guy that gets shot in the foot, RHCP fans!)

This is a movie certainly to be seen, and most of all for Keanu fans, as he appears topless or wet most of the time, and just manages to maintain his modesty when falling out of bed. Damn. Believe me, you can go through that particular scene as slow as you want, and you can't see anything! Almost though. You will not be disappointed.",1113868800,,4170,4.419270833333333
444740,5,6302256615,"Patrick and Keanu work well in this movie. It's about surfy bank robbers. Be in and out in 90 seconds!

The cheek that the surfies have is realistic. The ""cliffhanger moments"" are just a sheer genious, from the lawnmower decapitator scene, to shoot out at the gas station scene. Oh, and dont' forget the ""great chase"" scene! I could imagine that happening myself!

It's hard to describe! It's just brillantly written. There's no boring bits whatsoever! It's all great right to the end!

I could imagine bank robbers putting on masks as the ex-presidents! These days I could imagine them taking on George Bush junior.

There's some amazing cinematography - up in the air, on the ground and the surfing on beach of course.

This movie is just a pure adrenalin rush...

I am out of words, and as usual I don't want to spoil the story. It's hard writing a review without spoiling the story sometimes!

The movie is high on emotion, where Keanu finds it to increasingly difficult to be a cop and undercover as a surfie.

But if you love movies, greatly written movies that seem to cross over all sorts of genres, then get this one! I swear it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.",1112918400,5,1178,4.549763033175355

Swayze is much better (and he did most of his own surfing too).  Gary Busey is wonderful.  Lori Petti is the best of all, a really interesting character, and just burning up with intensity.  The surfing scenes are exhilarating, and the sky diving made me, your basic coward, want to go jump out a plane.  If I'd been told the plot before I'd seen the movie, I'd probably have avoided it.

444744,5,6302256615,"I first came accross this movie a few years ago on T.V. and even the bastardizing T.V. will usually do to a movie, I still enjoyed the bit of it I saw.  This is also true for the movie ""Lock Up.""  Anyways, I decieded to rent the movie, and was suprised by how good it was.  Most movie ""critics"" shun Keanu Reeves's acting, and in a way, I kind of see why they see it that way, but at the same time I think they need not compare it to shakespere either.  Most ""critics"" have it in for Keanu I think because of Bill and Ted.  Which if you get past the obvious flaws, and enjoy the movie for what it is, you don't notice any of the so-called bad acting.  Obviously, they are the only one's that think so, because the only votes that matter are the votes in the form of ticket sales, and quite frankly Keanu is on the upper escelon of this right along with Schwarzenegger,Stallone,Willis, and Travolta.  And like Bill and Ted, if you just take the movie for what it is,it is a great movie.  You really don't even have to try hard as Reeves once again makes a memorable character, and with Patrick Swayze in one of his best roles non-""chick-flick"" that I have seen him in. Swayze is a very ""real"" and textured character as Bodhi.  Basically the story is about Keanu Reaves's character Johnny Utah, who is a FBI agent getting his first assignment to track down the notorious Bank robbers, ""The Ex-Presidents"" who rob banks every summer-time and have never been caught.  Along with Utah Gary Busey is Angelo,Utah's veteren FBI partner who is very big on doing things the ""Old School"" way.  Together Angelo and Utah discover that the Ex-Presidents are probably surfers and figure out what ""break"" they surf by getting samples and doing anylasis.
Utah poses as a fellow surfer and meets what will be his love interest in the movie.  Lori Petty plays Utah's love interest Tyler and initially teaches him how to surf, and also gives info on the othe surfers in which his attention is directed for the first time to Bodhi.  Once Utah kind of gets the hang of surfing He and Angelo try to seek out who they think are the Ex-Presidents.  They come accross this gang of Surfers led by Red Hot Chili Pepper,Anthony Kiedus, who have criminal records and when confronted by these surfers, Bodhi steps in and Helps Utah.  Bodi then realizes that he is Johhny Utah QB from Ohio State.  He then asks Utah to play some football with he and his fellow surfers.  Once Bodhi sees Utah's exreme side while playing football, he kind of lets Utah into his gang.  Bodhi tells Utah about the spiritual side to surfing and Utah gets taken in by this and later this would affect his ability to catch Bodhi chasing him after a bank robbery.  Once Bodhi realizes that Utah is an FBI agent, he intends to get even by forcing him to be apart of a bank heist.  However the heist goes horribly wrong when Bodhi breaks his own rule and stays in the bank too long causing his little brother's death.  Eventually Angelo and Utah track down Bodhi on an Airstrip trying to flee the country and this is when Angelo gets shot and killed.  Bodhi gets away but not for long as Utah remembers that Bodhi would be going to Australia to catch some in human Monster wave.  As Utah apprehends Bodhi, Bodhi asks Utah for only one thing, to let him ride one last time.  Utah agrees and Bodhi rides and fades into the wave dying in the process.  By the end you learn some things and these messages really make you think.  Who is really right, Did Bodhi have a point?  I thought about the meaning long after the movie was over and soon bought the DVD and watched it many times since.  If you have ever surfed, skidived or just think that your 9-5 job sucks and would like a movie either to relate to or give you soming to think about, this movie does that.  Really give it a chance and think about what the meanings are and I'll bet you will like this movie as much as I have.",1083542400,2,3920,4.353507565337002
444745,4,6302256615,"Every scene in this movie is unintentionally hilarious.  Its a surfing movie that is really more like a parody of surfing.

The chase scene in particular had me rolling.  Utah actually gets a DOG thrown at him!?!
The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the chick who plays Utah's love interest.  for some reason she just gets on my nerves.

Great surfing shots, but the best has to be the skydive near the end.  The bank robbery where Bodhi and his cohorts discover who Reaves really is has a great chase scene where Bodhi narrowly escapes from Utah (Reaves).  This show keeps picking up more and more momentum till the very end.  A show you will probably want to keep and watch more than a few times.  Reaves and Swayze are believable in their parts.

First, of course, he has to learn how to surf.  And there just happens to be an attractive female surfer, played by Lori Petty, to teach him.  Naturally a romance develops but what is surprising is the remarkably short time it takes him to learn to surf. There's conflict with the other surfers too, but as he was once a football hero, he plays football on the beach with them and wins the respect of Bodhi, played by Patrick Swayzee.  Bodhi's into the spiritual side of surfing.  And he's also into free fall sky diving, night surfing and the ultimate thrills riding the waves.  The two men learn to respect each other. It's too bad that Bodhi is also a bank robber. And that he just happens to be Lori Petty's ex-boyfriend.
What follows is an action packed ride including chases on foot and with cars. There's several false leads and a bit of violence.  The story follows a formula, which is to be expected, but yet it is done very well.  The best part of the film though is the surfing.

Although Point Break is fascinating on many levels, it works extremely well as a metaphor for the Cold War.  Bodhi and his gang represent the Soviet Union, who threaten the United States (Johnny Utah) with their liberating ideology of robbing banks to finance an endless summer.  As a parallel to Marxist revolution as it generally existed in the Third World, Bodhi's anti-establishment surf rhetoric was indeed backed up by force--his goon Rosie represents the Red Army, or the KGB or something.
Johnny Utah is quite effective as the United States, going to any extreme (learning to surf, etc.) in order to crush his enemy.  Interestingly enough, however, Johnny gets a little bit ""too deep"" with Bodhi's gang, and for awhile mirrors the Carter administration's policy of peaceful coexistence with socialist sattelites (Nicaragua).  This doesn't last for long, however, when Gary Busey's Pappas (Ronald Reagan) convinces Johnny that he needs to bust the ex-presidents.
Tyler (Lori Petty) plays the unfortunate role of the victimized Third World.  The two superpowers, Bodhi and Johnny, are forced to use her as a ""proxy battlefield"" in order to avoid the mutually assured destruction that would certainly happen if they met head on.
In the end, the overwhelming force of Utah's defense spending (the FBI budget vs. Bodhi's crumbling Marxist/Bank Robbery economy) forces the ex-presidents to break up, and Bodhi dies a death that is infinitely more poetic and beautiful than that of the USSR.

The story revolves around special agent Johnny Utah (Reeves) and his veteran partner (Busey) on the trail of a group of mysterious bank robbers who wear masks of ex-presidents.  Soon enough, Reeves infiltrates a group of surfers (led by Swayze) who are believed to be linked to the robbers.  The performances are great, especially Swayze who gives one of his last high profile film performances before his career began to decline.  The fantasticly shot skydiving and surfing sequences are worth the price of admission alone, and Bigelow manages to nicely orchestrate some great action scenes.  Although it didn't fare very well at the box office, to this day Point Break continues to garner a cult following thanks to home video and television.

It has wonderful artistic moments ,with the waves used by the villainous surfers, as well as a group parachuting scene with the hero and villains all holding hands in a circle in the air.  The actors are well paired with both Keanu Reeve as the hero FBI agent who learns how to surf to catch the ex-Presidents bank robbers.  Patrick Swayze, in his best role, plays a guru philosopher surfer who heads up the bank robbers, wearing a Ronald Reagan mask during the armed robberies.  The bank robberies by the 4 surfers in their ex-presidents' masks verge on the hilarious.

The final surfing footage with Swayze and Reeve in Australia is breathtaking.  ""Point Break"" is well worth owning. Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, ""Titanic,"" ""Terminator""), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well.

There he meets his dark alter ego called Bodhi (Swayze), who becomes a dangerous teacher to him. However, Johnny is quick on the uptake: he stalks his prey ever mindful of Bodhi's most important lesson: If you want the ultimate thrill, you must be prepared to pay the ultimate price. Quite an entertaining movie although it is filled with all those familiar cliches of the teen movie genre, the most amusing being Keanu surfing in the stormy waves and yelling it out: ""I am Johnny Yooootaw ...!",1030320000,,826,4.783216783216783
444768,5,6302256615,"Before ""Speed"", before ""The Matrix"" or any of a half dozen other memorable films that Keanu Reeves has been in, there was ""Point Break"".  For sheer action, adrenaline, and quick thrills, nothing compares to this cops and robber movie set in the surfer sub culture of southern California. Keanu Reeves plays a young FBI recruit (Johnny Utah) on his first assignment, and lands in the middle of a bank robbery mystery that has been unraveling for several years. A group calling themselves the Ex-Presidents, and wearing outlanding disguises as Ron Reagan, Dick Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Lyndon Johnson, have successfully been looting area banks, so far without shooting or killing anyone. Reeves' older partner, played masterfully here by Gary Busey, confides to Keanu that he believes the bank robbers are surfers, who hit banks to support their wandering lifestyles, following the waves.
Suddenly the stage is set for a masterful cat and mouse game between Busey and Reeves on the one hand, and a group of surfers led by Patrick Swayze, on the other. The movie has everything, from gloriously photographed scenes of surfing to outrageous action sequences which are choreographed so memorably that they become the coda for the movie. There are several exceptional chase scenes, including one that is run by foot through yards, houses, and streets. In the end, it is a powerful allegory regarding the meaning of contemporary life and the rules we all try to live by, but in the meantime it is also a hell of an entertaining ride on the rollercoaster that Reeves and Busey have to ride in pursuit of the Ex-Presidents! ""Surfers rule, I swear to God"". Hahaha. Inside joke that you'll understand after viewing the film. Enjoy!",1026518400,12,1719,4.989547038327526

(USA - 1991)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR

Kathryn Bigelow's adrenaline-fuelled thriller - co-produced by James Cameron - combines Californian mysticism with pulse-pounding action set-pieces and toplines the iconic figure of Keanu Reeves (fetishized here by Don Peterman's expansive cinematography) as an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates a group of itinerant surfers (led by Patrick Swayze) responsible for a series of daring bank raids. Despite the film's relentless macho swagger, POINT BREAK aims for something more profound than your average summer blockbuster and is distinguished by some extraordinary visual conceits: From the glorious surfing scenes to the action highlights (most notably, Reeves' heart-stopping pursuit of a fleeing bank raider through a suburban landscape) to a show-stopping sky-dive sequence which lifts the film onto another plane altogether, far removed from the typical excesses of American commercial cinema.

Lori Petty (TANK GIRL) provides the nominal love interest - and very good she is, too - but W. Peter Iliff's script focuses almost exclusively on the ambiguous relationship between 'good guy' Reeves and 'villain' Swayze, drawing them together in adversity, while the supporting cast is rounded out by the likes of Gary Busey (THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY), John C. McGinley, James LeGros (DRUGSTORE COWBOY), and experienced surfers John Philbin (NORTH SHORE) and Bojesse Christopher (co-writer and director of OUT IN FIFTY [1999]), both exquisitely beautiful. However, Reeves dominates the movie with typical economy and grace, balancing his trademark 'cool dude' persona against the heavier dramatic requirements of his role as a dedicated FBI agent.

The narrative stumbles badly toward the end (Swayze's abrupt deviation from established procedure during one of the climactic sequences is totally inexplicable, and the subsequent body count would almost certainly have prompted the FBI to dismiss Reeves from the service long before his final showdown with Swayze), but the film survives primarily as a unique combination of surfing, action and ultra-sexy young actors. Whether by accident or design, POINT BREAK has 'cult movie' written all over it.",1021420800,7,2257,5.705357142857143

444777,5,6302256615,"Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" is quite frankly one of the greatest films ever made mainly because what it's not; serious.
This is not a serious film...not in the least, but it is entertaining...which was exactly what the filmmakers intended. As with all action films, there are basic plot elements, and characters that are sometimes thin, but what ""Point Break"" contains are characters that know exactly what kind of situation they are in, thus making them believable. Patrick Swayze is especially memorable as the zen surf master, Bohdi, who believes that life is a thrill ride designed by gods. The plot is perhaps stretching it a bit (how to stop surfers that rob banks), but the film itself, taking into account the technical aspects of it, is brilliant. Executive Produced and written (uncredited) by James Cameron, Bigelow's film towers above most others in areas of energy,and in surf and aerial cinematography. The film's surf and sky-diving sequences will take your breath away. Other high- lights include virtuoso steadi-cam movement in a memorable foot-chase through a suburban neighborhood. ""Point Break"" is a film that knew it wasn't going to make AFI's 100 best films ever made...it knew that it wasn't going to change the world in any way...and it knew that it's existance was only to entertain. Because of that, it becomes a film that is astonishing in it's sheer amount of energy, and an example in action filmmaking.",999475200,3,1436,5.063291139240507

My Opinion:  What does 5 stars mean to me? Basically it comes down to did I enjoy it and how much. If I enjoyed it a lot and had fun or was completely moved then it's 5 stars to me. Now there are going to be a lot of different 5 star movies. Point Break is a fun lighthearted 5 stars compared to a movie like To Kill a Mockingbird which is a classic 5 star movie that deals with some heavy issues. With that out of the way, Point Break is a lot of fun.

Reeves takes a lot of heat for his acting ability (or lack thereof), but movies like ""Point Break"" prove that in the right circumstances, he can excel.  No heavy thought required here--Reeves is right (dare I say perfect?) for the role of almost emotionally blank FBI cowboy Johnny Utah, while Gary Busey as his crusty partner stereotype (this guy in the FBI?

Point Break has all the elements that make a film for alot of guys: action, conflict, comedy, some sweet chicks, and ultimately redemption.  It just grabs you from the start and never lets you go.
