Greeks together at the United Nations demonstration on January 16,
1993.  The Greeks came from various parts of Greece:
Epirus, Macedonia, Pontos, Asia Minor, Central Greece
and Crete. They speak with Americans about how Greece
suffered and sacrificed in the 20th century while being
only one of four allies of Britain and the U.S. in
World War I, World War II and Korea.

Now they ask the citizens of the world to defend democracy
and join them in chanting MACEDONIA IS GREECE !!

The DVD ends with a tour of a museum exhibition of Alexander The Great's Macedonia.",1231545600,,622,4.849056603773585
8573347,2,B001O2SHFS,"Greece won its freedom from Turkey thanks to Great Britain which turned the country into its stopping point in the Mediterranean Sea. A proof for that is the flag of the country which holds immediate resemblance to that of the British East Indies Trading Company. Ever since the country at the southern tip of the Balkans got back on its feet, it started carrying out an expansion towards Macedonia. Greek soldiers, irregulars and mercenaries conducted a campaign of ""clearing"" out Macedonian lands from its original inhabitants and replacing them with Christian population that came from within the core of the Ottoman Empire. The infamous population trade in the early 20th century resulted in influx of 200,000 new Greeks who populated Aegan Macedonia. This DVD does not hold the real truth about Macedonia and the imposed ""name issue"" with Greece. It is not a relevant source of data or facts and it inspires ultra-nationalism from which the country is suffering and has a very low ranking in European standards, but yet it gets away with crime even though it is a country member of the European Union.",1229904000,13,1106,4.951612903225806
