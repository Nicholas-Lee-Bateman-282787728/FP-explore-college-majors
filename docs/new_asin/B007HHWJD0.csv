5086186,2,B007HHWJD0,"I knew this movie would be a made for tv special, but I had to see my Dolly on the big screen. There was a lot of singing (unfortuntey Dolly's solo song should've been cut short-it was boring). For some reason supporting actors were given unnessacary storylines of their own. There also wasn't enough focus on the romance between the main characters. There wasn't enough background information on the lead actor. The movie was just all over the place. I suspect it was written by a high school student. Two stars for Dolly and some of the lines made me laugh.",1326412800,5,559,4.544554455445544
5086187,5,B007HHWJD0,"After 20 years of being away from the silver screen (her last feature film was 1992's ""Straight Talk"") legend Dolly Parton teams up with the great Queen Latifah for ""Joyful Noise"", a movie hitting theatres on January 13th, 2012. The plot deals with Dolly's character (Gi Gi) who is married to the choir director. Her husband (played by Kris Kristofferson) suddenly dies and she believes that upon her husband's death she will lead the Church choir. However, the Church decides to allow the character played by Queen Latifah (Vi Rose Hill) to head the choir and this leads to all kinds of rivalry between the two. The choir, once organized properly competes in various competitions around the country.

 The music is fantastic and features some wonderful remakes as well as new material written by Dolly Parton, three new songs including her self-penned haaunting ""From Here To The Moon And Back"" that she wrote for her real-life husband. Both Dolly and Latifah sing in the movie. There are also some wonderful remakes of both classic and pop songs including Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Chris Brown's ""Forever"".

 The subplot deals with the love affair between two young people played to perfection by Jeremy Jordon (a Broadway actor) and Keke Palmer, Dolly and the Queen's grandson and daughter, who ultimately brings everything together.

 The movie is heart warming, funny, sad, and uplifting and should be a certified box office champ when it's released nation wide.

 Dolly's part was written with her specifically in mind by Todd Graff, the film's writer and director.

 Mervynn Warren who worked on the music on ""Sister Act 2"" and ""The Preacher's Wife"" has produced the soundtrack so look for that in stores. I for one cannot wait!

 ""Joyful Noise"" cost $25,000,000 to make and was a certified hit in its opening weekend grossing an impressive $13.8 million which is exactly what Warner Brothers was aiming for! This has led to very strong sales of the movie's soundtrack which is quite good. As of March 5, 2012 the film has grossed over $30,000,000. The movie will be released in Singapore on March 15, 2012, the U.K. on April 27th and Australian and New Zealand the day before on April 26th.

 On May 1, 2012 ""Joyful Noise"" will see both a DVD and BluRay release. You will even be able to purchase both together in one complete set. Special features on the BluRay will include ""Spotlight on a Song: Dolly Parton's 'From Here to the Moon and Back'"", ""Inspiration of Joyful Noise"", ""Make Some Noise"", ""Leading Ladies"", extended songs and a digital version of the film available for download. The DVD/BluRay combo will retail for $35.99 and the DVD will be $22.97.",1317168000,32,2684,4.87032967032967

For those of you who don't know who Dolly Parton is, Let me fill you in on her movie career. She has stared in 9 to 5. The Best Little Whore House in Texas. Rhinestone. Steel Magnolias. Straight Talk. & Now Joyful Noise. Not to mention Tv movies like Unlikely Angel. Blue Valley Songbird. Smoky Mountain Christmas. Coat of many Colors. & Wild Texas Wind.

5086213,4,B007HHWJD0,"The critics didn't like this movie but they seldom like anything sentimental or Christian. But I thought it was a good movie with a great cast. The music is almost all pop songs instead of actual Christian music. I know they were trying to appeal to a broader audience but I wish they had used more Christian music- not hymns but more contemporary Christian or gospel. Anyway, my 11 year old grandson has watched it 3 times in the last month and  loves it. Especially because he likes the young male lead Jeremy Jordan.",1489795200,,519,4.5212765957446805

5086228,1,B007HHWJD0,Watched this on Netflix. It's a HORRIBLE movie. The movie sends a very bad message to teenagers. Way too sexually suggestive. Movies have seriously gone downhill.

5086261,1,B007HHWJD0,"The only thing that made me give this movie 1 star was maybe 2 or 3 songs in the whole thing, including the final performance.  The rest made me sick to my stomach.  Why?  Because when you put a bunch of people in a movie about church/Christianity who know next to nothing about God's character or His Word, you get a movie like this - sexual immorality, vulgar language, gossip, slander...I lost count after that.  It's sickening to watch a movie that's supposed to be about Christians singing praise to God and all I here and see is the world.  It's like Hollywood decided to make a pitch to the Christian world and failed miserably.  I'm highly surprised they didn't drop the ""F"" bomb...oh, wait...then it would have been rated ""R""?

How about My Savior Lives which was performed by Nicole C. Mullen - an absolutely beautiful rendition that if you have not heard it, go now to find it -- I know that it is before her time but if it were to be made again, My White Boots by Jamie Grace -- many scenes would have that song be appropriate.

I understand this was a bunch of ""stars"" getting their Christian on... which is why so many people have a hard time believing that Christians do exist that actually do believe in what we talk about.",1470787200,,725,4.451127819548872

It wasn't a terrible movie, but when I find myself checking the timer on the DVD player wondering how much longer we have, then I know it's missed the mark.

5086581,5,B007HHWJD0,"I absolutely loved this movie.  You've got the comedies and talent of two amazing singer/actresses:  Dolly P and Queen L.  This movie had drama, comedy, with some hints of tear jerking moments thrown in to catch you off your toes!  Each scene was an exciting adventure.  I thought this was just about the journey of a competition.  It is so much more.  I wasn't expecting so many stories in this movie.  The surprise was such a delight.

It has great writing, great acting, and hot hot hot music and choreography.  For Kirk Franklin fans, yep he's in it for a brief moment..  He does not overshadow the purpose of this movie (yea).  There are no cons about this movie.  Only pros.  It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to movies.  But, this one is a WOW.  I love the contemporary flair of gospel music and the dancing.

Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord.  Well, they certainly achieved that.  I should not have watched this movie at 11pm.  Now I am too hyped to go to bed.  Well with any case, I rented it from the library, now I am ordering it.  If you like upbeat music, choreography in a church setting or with a church competition setting, you can't help but fall in love with this movie.  If you enjoyed Sister Act II, you will absolutely fall in love with this one.  Joyful Noise is like Sister Act II on cotton candy with jelly bean chasers.  Hy-per!  I approve this message :)

This will be my go to when my day is well.....not so joyful.  Good luck and enjoy. Be blessed!!!!",1393632000,,1489,4.316363636363636

5086597,1,B007HHWJD0,"People rave about this being a feel good movie. They compare it to Sister Act. Such a difference! Talk about comparing a 0/.5 star movie to a 4.5/5 star movie!

Ok, so both movies were comparing ""stiffness"" in the church regarding music. That is where the comparison ends.
1) Sister Act has lots of exciting action. Joyful Noise... (crickets chirping)... the action is people yelling and cussing at each other. Soooo feel good. Yeah, right.
2) Sister Act has hints of sexual things having happened or going to happen, but you never see anything. Very much a family friendly movie. Joyful noise... seems like everybody is groping everybody else's butt in the church. Yuck!
3) Sister Act actually portrays Christians with character, doing good for other people, being involved in the community, making a difference... and most importantly, loving God. Joyful noise... these people claim to be christians, but seem more like a sexual-ified do-gooders singing club that never actually does any good. Oh, yes, some serve in the soup kitchen's once, but bring about no change to the community... other than somehow the community would feel soooooo much better if they won the competition - yeah, me too. (Stomach rumbling, kids crying, people screaming at each other) ""Yeah, we won!"" Hmmmmm..... doesn't cut it, I think.
4) The singing in both was pretty good. Though I personally liked the Sister Act songs a lot better. They actually sounded Christian. I couldn't tell half the time if the Joyful noise people were singing and wiggling their hips at each other or God.

Now don't get me wrong. Sister Act isn't my favorite movie or anything, I just watched it last month. But as the two have been compared in some reviews, I thought I'd compare them in more detail. Sister Act is sooooooooooo much more feel good than this movie. Unless, of course, broken families, rampant sexuality, continuous cussing, jealousy, lousy guys and poor religion get you some warm fussies.",1390003200,,1966,4.954545454545454

5086636,5,B007HHWJD0,I had not heard of this film and it came on Stars. I caught it half way through and had to have it. I love gospel musicals.

5086645,3,B007HHWJD0,It was entertaining and cute. I love Dolly and wish she would do more movies. She is talented in many areas.,1379462400,,108,4.190476190476191
5086646,5,B007HHWJD0,"""This town is so small you can be married three times and still have all the same in-laws!"" This is a teeny sample of the kind of corn-pone, good- natured humor you will enjoy.

Full disclosure: I have never been a fan of Gospel music...but this movie could change my mind. We are with a small-town choir that competes in regional and national contests, so we see thrilling choreography and hear terrific music. Each time a number ends we think, ""How can they beat THAT?""

Here is the top tier of talent:
  * Dolly Parton (""Nine to Five""), whose character is widowed during the opening credits. She fully expects to take the place of her choir director husband after his fatal heart attack. Her solo is so sweet..... Remember she has earned multiple Grammy Awards.
  * Queen Latifah (""The Secret Life of Bees"") gets that coveted position of choir director instead. This only increases the bad blood between Parton's wealthy widow and Latifah's single mom. Her solo is poignant..... Remember, she too, has been honored by the Grammys.
  * Keke Palmer (""Akeelah and the Bee"") is the talented daughter of that new choir director. Her mother can't accept her daughter's burgeoning maturity, while SHE can't accept her parents' sepa- ration. I LOVE her Face in the Mirror solo!
  * Jeremy Jordon, primarily a stage actor (""Newsies"" and ""West Side Story"") plays the widow's grandson. He lands back in this little burg after his mother kicks him out. He spent his childhood here, so he already knows that talented daughter! BTW, this actor is a FIND! He sings, he dances, he acts and he's good-looking!
  * Courtney B. Vance (""Final Destination 5"") is the minister of the local church. He wants what is best for the church, the town, and his parishioners, but he has to balance the budget, too.
  * Kris Kristofferson (""Dolphin Tale"") makes a couple of cameos as the soon-dead choir director.

There are so many other outstanding actors, it's a shame I don't have more room. Suffice it to say, you will come to know everyone in the choir and you will delight in each person's moment to shine. And the cat-fights between Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah are a pure joy. Both are so likable and the dialogue is so good, you want them to go on and on.

This PG-13 movie has a little more (mild) profanity than I expected, but it's done in such a good-spirited way, I can't be too upset. There is a throw-away subplot or two, but we are so busy enjoying ourselves, we overlook them. We see no sweaty bodies, vehicular mayhem (watch Grandma Dolly drive!), gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. We see lots of decent people trying to bring some pride to a little town that has had its share of hard knocks.

When I go to a movie, I always want someone to root for. This one gives us a whole town full of worthy folks. What a pleasure. ""Joyful Noise"" is a pulse-quickening joy!",1379116800,,2855,4.599605522682446

5086693,4,B007HHWJD0,"The best part of this movie was the music: gospel, rock, country, it was all there.  Dolly Parton looking a little bit more ""nipped and tucked"" as she even admitted in the movie is still herself as a gritty, plain spoken, wife and grandma.  Her husband played by Kris Kristofferson is a choir director and sadly has a brief few moments in this film which is too bad because he's a terrific actor in my opinion.  Queen Latifah is mom to a boy and girl, and the wife of a soldier who chooses to stay away. (It's never clear because he's stationed in the US) The whole theme of the movie concerns a choir competition that this small church choir never seems to win and that's where the conflict is between GiGi(Dolly) and ViRose(Latifah)  Vi wants to keep it spiritual and more sedate, and GiGi wants to bring it up several notches.  There are also these sideline romances between Vi's daughter and GiGi's grandson.  It seems at times that the plot and storyline is contrived because it seems to involve personality conflicts and none of it has any bearing on anything.  There's a lot of good singing on the part of Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah as well as the choir and the actors playing the younger grandson, daughter, and the Asberger's son of Vi.  It's kind of a light film that's entertaining, kind of a cross between Sister Act and Bring It On.",1367539200,,1349,4.5

The small town of Pacashau, Georgia, has fallen on hard times, but the people are counting on the Divinity Church Choir to lift their spirits by winning the National Joyful Noise Competition. But the discord between its two leading ladies now threatens to tear them apart. But Vi Rose Hill [Queen Latifah] stubbornly wants to stick with their tried-and-true traditional style, while the fiery G.G.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Like 'Sister Act' for instance, pretty much sums up 'Joyful Noise' because you see, I actually have a strange fondness for Sister Mary Clarence and her band of singing nuns. Now, 'Joyful Noise' isn't as successful as those two influences that it strives to emulate, but the films brilliant sweet fusion of pop and gospel presents a singing harmony that is a beautiful uplifting delight, and is definitely a light foray into family entertainment. Despite being slightly predictable, by-the-numbers, the film does have a certain likeable beautiful charm, to elevate to wonderful heights and mind you, it's a truly amusing effort all the same that will uplift your heart and soul.

The story follows a small town church choir as they practice for an upcoming competition. The choir's director, Vi Rose Hill [Queen Latifah], wishes to continue taking the group in a traditional, gospel oriented style, but conflict arises when the boisterous G.G. Sparrow [Dolly Parton] recommends a more modern, pop influenced approach. At the same time, a young romance develops between G.G. Sparrow's grandson, Randy Garrity [Jeremy Jordan], and Vie's daughter, Olivia Hill [Keke Palmer], further complicating matters. With the national competition fast approaching and the very fate of the choir at stake, the two women will have to compromise or accept the group's dissolution.

The film presents a new legendary cinematic pairing for the ages in the form of Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton. All kidding aside, the two actresses are both very talented and really do have great chemistry together. Their feisty dynamic leads to some of the films more entertaining moments and it is fun to see them butt heads. Keke Palmer is also a real standout, delivering a very solid performance. Actually, all of the actors are good in their roles, and while the material they have to work with isn't always the best, they infuse the proceedings with an appealing splash of charisma.

Though not a musical in the traditional sense, the film is home to numerous musical performances. The characters don't break out into random song, but within the context of the choir's practices and competitions we are treated to many soulful melodies. These numbers are all staged and executed well, blending gospel music with contemporary hits. As far as I know, the cast all handle their own vocal duties and do a remarkable job.

Despite the cast's charm and the music's allure, the script and direction are all rather basic. The plot offers nothing we haven't seen before, with all of the same dramatic beats we've grown accustomed to in similar films. Even ignoring the familiarity of the story, the filmmakers stay pretty close to the surface of all the conflicts, failing to engage the audience on a deeper level. Character development is also lacking, and a few of the films more heated moments don't connect as well as intended.

Going along with the films thin characterisations, are some underdeveloped and at times quite superfluous subplots. G.G. Sparrow's relationship with her deceased husband, Bernard Sparrow [Kris Kristofferson] is mostly skimmed over, especially as you only get a glimpse of him at the start of the film. This makes a fantasy duet between the two that occurs later in the film. Another subplot focusing on one of the adult choir members, Earla [Angela Grovey] who sadly has a misfortune half way through the film and its conclusion is extremely abrupt with a convenient resolution that comes out of nowhere and happy ending to her dilemma.

'Joyful Noise' now carries the fine distinction of being a big favourite film of mine about a singing church choir, especially when nothing beats 'Sister Act' as you might have guessed! The cast is good and the musical performances are strong, but the script could of done with a re-write, and slightly formulaic, but despite this, I can tell you that is a fantastic feel good film, especially for the whole family and by the end of the film you feel your heart has been uplifted, especially with the final song in the Competition.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is provided with a beautiful 1080p encoded transfer image in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio. With a few bursts of lively colour and an overall pleasing level of clarity, this is a good video presentation. The source is in pristine shape with a light layer of grain visible throughout. Detail is pretty good, but some indoor scenes tend to look a bit soft and dim. Outdoor sequences, however, feature a great sense of depth and pop with a very sharp image. Colours are vivid and nicely saturated without ever overpowering the picture. The opening and closing choir performances are particularly impressive, with sumptuous lighting design that bathes the screen with bold blues and purples. Contrast is high and blacks are steady.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio is presented in an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track along with an optional Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track is also included. While the various musical numbers are quite impressive, the rest of the track's sound design is rather ho-hum, resulting in a decidedly mixed but still satisfying audio experience. Speech and vocals remain full, clear and well prioritised throughout. The musical numbers are all enveloping, deep and aggressive, packing a wide dynamic range with strong fidelity. Stereo separation is strong for the songs and some faint but welcomed surround cues and audience reactions help to open up the soundstage further. The narrative portions of the film are not as impressive, however, with a comparatively small sound field. Effects work is fairly sparse and while there is some very minimal environmental ambiance, the rear speakers remain very quiet. Bass activity is solid during the songs but is otherwise negligible. The audio elements are well balanced together, but the musical performances are mixed a bit higher, making transitions just a little jarring at times. The mix is a little manic, but even though the narrative sections of the film aren't as immersive as the musical performances they suit the material just fine. A bit more immersion throughout would have been welcomed, but the track manages to succeed anyway.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Make Some Noise [2012] [1080p] [2:00] Get an inside look as the young stars light up the screen, this is basically just an extended trailer with a few fleeting comments from the cast mixed in.

Special Feature: Leading Ladies [2012] [1080p] [2:00] Get an all-access look at the recording studio with Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah talk about how fun it was to work together. Again, there really isn't much here outside of empty praise.

BONUS: The film has twelve songs inspired by the film under the name Joyful Noise Original Motion Picture Soundtrack including ""Fix Me, Jesus,"" ""In Love,"" ""Higher Medley"" and much much more. The soundtrack is performed by all the stars of the film. Dolly Parton wrote three of the songs, including ""Not Enough Love,"" ""From Here To The Moon and Back"" and ""He's Everything"" and is an absolutely fantastic musical extravaganza and if you are feeling down, put this Compact Disc on and your worries will float away and at some of the tracks on the Compact Disc you will definitely get up and have a good dance marathon, as the songs are just totally brilliant and a lot of them were penned by Dolly Parton and this Compact Disc is a good companion to the Joyful Noise Blu-ray disc and you will not be disappointed, as there is not a duff track in any of them and on top of all that, you get to hear the full versions of the songs in the film. Very Highly Recommended!

Finally, Joyful Noise occasionally flirts with being a very interesting character driven piece, but does not want to make the leap into the field, instead reverting to safe, slightly saccharine convention and loses my interest in the process. Technically the Blu-ray is decent, though from a bonus material perspective it is somewhat bland. Unless choirs, Dolly Parton, Queen Latifah or any combination therein are your cup of tea, then this is the film for you. On top of all that, I think the Blu-ray Cover design is the BEST out of all the different Blu-ray release of the film and is the same image that is on the Original Soundtrack Compact Disc and check it to see what I mean. All in all I found this film simply fantastic and as an added bonus it has the very talented and prolific song writer Dolly Parton, who in my mind can do no wrong in any of her films, apart from the disastrous and embarrassing film she did with Burt Reynolds, which was a tight turkey and Dolly says it was a total embarrassment to do and sadly was contractual to finish the film. It makes me so mad how other reviewers has been so derogatory in their remarks towards Joyful Noise and as far as I am concerned their negative views are vacuous and obviously they must of watched a different film, as I loved it and I am so proud to add another Dolly Parton film to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5086761,5,B007HHWJD0,"This wonderful film has a cast derived mainly from the world of Broadway, and it shows, as out of sheer panic, a racially diverse gospel choir transmutes into an ad hoc musical theatrical ensemble. As they struggle, they take the film out of the realm of humdrum Hollywood and into the  unique world of musical stage art. When Keke Palmer as Queen Latifa's daughter, Olivia Hill, performs 'Higher Medley during the climax of the film, she brings it all home, with a combo of be-bop crooning, musical theater and synthesized pop music from the 80's to the present. Her boyfriend, Jeremy Jordon, outdoes himself with his own solo a la Chris Brown, as well as ensemble pieces with Keke and the choir. Queen Latifa's voice is more lyrical than it used to be, and the covers are fantastic, from the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Usher, Billy Preston, all the way to the inimitable Dolly Parton herself, who continues to sing like an angel. The sum yields musical theatre so stunning that if there were no plot at all the film would still stand as sensational.

Yet the plot itself has its subtle importance. Memories and incidents create a montage of concurrent lives, containing small, significant messages the viewer can digest and interpret at leisure, almost as a backdrop to the music. At the same time, Queen Latifa boldly conveys her deliberate intention to correct the wrongs of modern life, as she struggles to dominate the ethical processes of the young people. Dolly, using her legendary, angelic soul force, battles with a weary Latifa; the kids, as they blossom and find themselves, engage in the timeless struggle to create a new world while remaining true to the old. There's little needless tension in this family film, but it is not trite - containing elements of social commentary and family anguish that give it depth.",1356393600,,1828,4.855769230769231
5086762,2,B007HHWJD0,"Plot was predictable and too few laughs.  I like Queen Latifah, yet this movie did her no justice.  Down right stupid in parts.",1356393600,,127,4.478260869565218
5086763,4,B007HHWJD0,"I watched so many previous for Joyful Noise and as a gospel singer myself, I thought that this would be an appropriate movie and I was not disappointed.  The singing in this film is excellent and innovative, especially the competition scenes.  The story line lacks a little bit (which is why I gave it four stars) because the romances are a bit contrived, as are some of the scenes between Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah.

5086788,1,B007HHWJD0,"I went out on Black Thursday to get this and I am glad that I only paid $7.86 for it, even that was too much. I hate to say it but even Dolly can not save this vessel from going down. I wanted to like this so, so, so very much, I really did. I love Dolly but man, this was just awful. I feel like maybe if I watch it a second time it will grow on me but I doubt it. I should have read up on it more before I made the leap. I HATE chick flicks, I mean I expected this movie to be about Dolly and Queen fighting it out at Gospel competitions and being funny as usual, but it was basically boiled down to a film about 2 teens who have a summer affair with each other and Dolly and Queen just happen to be in the kids lives. Like an earlier review said, this is basically just a long episode of Glee, which I can not stand. I like Gospel and some Musicals are alright, but this was just like watching Glee for over an hour. The only part that was funny was when Dolly and Queen fought in the restaurant and Dolly started throwing rock hard dinner rolls and spaghetti. When the film opened and Dolly's husband has a heart attack and then passes away, it was sad, so I figured it would be great from then on, but it just never got better, it went downhill. From the minute that I put the Blu in, I watched and waited until the end and just hated it. I guess I may be biased because I do not like chick flicks, which this is not a 100% chick flick, it is just mainly a movie that a teen girl may like. Dolly always gets 5 stars, no matter how much her face changes, but the film sucks.",1353628800,2,1578,3.873456790123457

I can appreciate some of the spiritual themes in this movie, but my over-arching love for this film is due to the fact that it is awful. Putting Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton together in a movie was a stroke of genius. The dialogue is confusing, some very strange things occur in the plot line, and characters aren't very consistent.

It was humorous with Dolly Pardon and Queen Latifah, serious and playful.  Enjoyed it very much!",1348444800,,325,4.311475409836065
5086806,2,B007HHWJD0,"This movie begins with an ""untimely"" death (as in, blink and you'll miss the fact that Kris Kristofferson was even in this movie!).  There isn't much to uplift it after that, although they make a game attempt to try.  Unfortunately, their idea of a boost was to have a cold and impersonal Pastor (Courtney B. Vance) inform the grieving widow (Dolly Parton) that she will not be their replacement choir director.  In effect, your husband's dead and buried and we don't want you.  What follows is a laundry list of unchristian behavior: loads of sniping, backbiting, unseemly rants and rages, even blackmail!  Most of the incivility swirls around the executive producer/star Queen Latifah.  She plays a thoroughly unpleasant character, Vi Rose Hill, a woman destined for anger management classes somewhere.  When she isn't hogging center screen, Vi Rose verbally assaults just about everyone within earshot, at one point soundly slapping her daughter for good measure.  If their object was to portray this aimlessly pious woman as a mother from hell, they certainly succeeded.  If this was a ""feel-good"" movie, when were we supposed to feel good?  In those sterile moments when Vi Rose bothered to take a breath between screeches?  Music aside, just what was the purpose of this movie?  Clearly, it was all about one woman, Vi Rose, and oh yes, what's her puss, G.G. Sparrow, kept firmly at the edges of the screen, out of the way.  There wasn't much to tie it together except for animosity.
However well meaning the filmmakers might have been, what they turned out was a contrived story, desperate with platitudes no one seemed to follow.  It was like watching a flipbook rapidly jumping from one scene to another, none of which seemed connected.  One minute there was spilt urine the next a roof top confession then an echo match in a quarry!  All bridged with a lot of nastiness from Vi Rose.  I kept waiting for something of import to happen but instead it just unraveled into a predictable ending that should have surprised no one.  I thought this movie was incredibly superficial and not a little cynical.  They might just as well have called it Sister Act 3.",1348099200,,2163,4.844686648501362

5086810,2,B007HHWJD0,"There are things that I liked about this movie. I think Queen Latifah's character is a good example of a frustrated, but determined Christian. Were all her antic's Christian? No. A Christian is not someone who is perfect, but someone who tries, see's where they've done wrong and repents. A Christian is someone who believes in Jesus and follows His teachings.

So, that said. Besides some gospel music, I didn't see where this film was supposed to be a reflection of a real Christian Church. The one night stand was kind of laughed off and ignored. Dolly Parton's character kept making threats to withdraw funding if she didn't get her way. The boy joined the choir to get the girl and didn't really change. The music was not in worship of God, but really at anyone who would listen. They could have achieved that by just having it be a high school choir contest or something. If the music is not to worship and praise, why bother?

Queen Latifah's family was, I think, a fairly good example. Tough times, bad moments, but a changing for the better in the end. If the whole movie was like that then I could connect it with the Christian faith. True Christian faith.",1347408000,5,1166,4.574162679425838

It was until someone had to interject profanity into the movie for some strange reason. THEN we had choir members sleeping with each other - yeah - that was funny and so very Christian like. It was so sad to see beautiful voices wasted. And Dolly - what were you thinking??

 So - turned it off (after we paid to rent it) and read a book.....",1344297600,3,459,4.146067415730337

5086830,2,B007HHWJD0,"I generally love the work of both Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton, but this movie was an exception.  For a movie centered around music, most of it was only mediocre.  With two vocal powerhouses starring in this film, I expected more.  The exceptions were the final numbers performed at the choir contest by Dolly and Queen Latifah's choir, and the youth choir they were competing against.  However, for a competition showcasing church/gospel choirs, the pop music presented by both was not spiritually uplifting, which is what I believe church choirs are supposed to be there for.

It was so hard for me to look at Dolly in this film.  She used to be such a beautiful woman.  Unfortunately she has had so much plastic surgery, her face is stiff and wooden now.  She has the stereotypical PS nose and stretched mouth that we've seen on Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers, Bruce Jenner, and others.  Her once big, radiant smile is gone and she seemed to have had only one expression on her face they entire time, an odd, stretched, lips slightly parted smile, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"".  To her credit, her character on several occasions, made fun of her plastic surgery - facial and otherwise.

I also felt that moral and Christian standards were generally made light of.  This surprised me, given the overall subject matter of the film.",1343779200,,1343,4.816593886462882

5086833,3,B007HHWJD0,"Joyful Noise is basically a musical film based around a Gospel church choir that wishes to travel to California and compete (and win) a Gospel music tournament.  Along the way, characters fight and squabble, fall in and out of love, have family issues, and sing often.

Some of the musicians and actors in the film are great -- Queen Latifah and Keke Palmer stand out.  Dolly Parton performs well also.  Some of the other characters seem a stretch and are not quite as strong.

The music is particularly good in this film -- standout tracks include a piano song, ""Fix Me Jesus,"" performed by Queen Latifah, and a duet ""To the Moon and Back"" by Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson.

The simple basis of the story and some of the contrived scenarios were, to me, the largest disappointment of the film.  It seemed a little too easy to fix and overcome these difficulties to make it to the contest.  Often the scenes were predictable in my opinion, particularly the romance between Keke Palmer's character and Dolly's ""grandson.""  This area seemed much weaker in comparison to some of the strong stage and film musicals of the past.

Overall the movie was positive to watch, but I would probably spend more time listening to the soundtrack of the excellent songs.",1343088000,3,1260,4.738532110091743

I'm glad she made this her ""come back"" movie.  She as a little firecracker.  I loved her spunky character.  Queen Latifah was a pleasant departure from her usual zany type in her movies.  I loved this serious side to her.  This movie was ""worth the price of admission"" as the saying goes.  I did not like the box it was received in.  The inside jacket was glued to the outside cover.

I am so glad I bought Joyful Noise!! This movie is funny, happy a little sad but lots of hope and joy. I've watched it about 6 times and could watch it again any time.

Naturally that means a lot of rehearsal filled with Whitney-style, gospel renditions of familiar Top 40 pop classics. On this level, it doesn't disappoint since the churchy arrangements bring out a roof-raising soulfulness that is otherwise missing from the flimsily plotted film. Energetic performances of Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" definitely deliver the goods at key moments, but director/screenwriter Todd Graff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Camp/dp/B0000VV4MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Camp</a>) relies on tired stereotypes and down-home hokum to fill out the framework of a story about a small Georgia town hard hit by the current economic downturn. Providing a beacon of light is the Sacred Divinity Choir anchored by two divas with opposing sensibilities, the conservative and financially struggling Vi Rose Hill and the saucy and wealthy G.G. Sparrow.

The movie wastes no time in giving G.G.'s husband Bernard a fatal coronary even before the opening credits are complete. The uptight church pastor needs to find a successor and chooses Vi Rose over G.G. setting the stage for a stylistic war over the choir's musical direction. Naturally, Vi Rose prefers traditional gospel, while G.G. wants a more contemporary twist to the arrangements, which suits Vi Rose's 16-year-old daughter Olivia just fine since she is a budding soloist with those gymnastically limber, Mariah-inspired pipes you either love or hate. Complicating matters is G.G.'s juvenile delinquent grandson Randy, who of course, turns out to be a talented singer in his own right and falls head-over-heels for Olivia. Once you add Olivia's quirky younger brother Walter, who turns out to have Asperger's Syndrome, and Manny, a conveniently talented guitarist and Randy's rival for Olivia's affection, you have the makings of a suspense-free, by-the-numbers soap opera with the sophistication of a young adult novel.

It wouldn't be giving much away to state that it all climaxes with a face-off between the choir and the prodigious Our Lady of Perpetual Tears youth choir, spotlighting lead singer Ivan Kelley Jr., who impresses with his knockout version of Billy Preston's ""That's the Way God Planned It"". The choir counters with a rousing medley of Sly and the Family Stone, Usher, Chris Brown and Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours"". Outside of the singing, the performances are serviceable and little more. Queen Latifah and a cosmetically altered Dolly Parton play Vi Rose and G.G. to their accustomed, outsized personalities. As Olivia, Keke Palmer (grown up from her impressive turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akeelah-and-the-Bee/dp/B000G1R394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akeelah and the Bee</a>) has a strong set of pipes as does current Broadway sensation Jeremy Jordan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Newsies/dp/B007OA0XCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Newsies</a>) as Randy, but neither makes much of an impression otherwise.

Martin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rent/dp/B000GT6KEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rent</a>) is also wasted in a small role as Vi Rose's estranged husband who escaped to the Army when he couldn't find a job.

There are several inspiring scenes in this movie (scenes include: teen/parent drama, bullying, insecurity, people with disabilities, love, etc.) that most can identify with. The story line is down-to-earth. I also like the fact that the casting of the movie is very diverse and race is never an issue or even mentioned. This movie trully reflects the diversity of God's people.

5086856,4,B007HHWJD0,"The film is a long TV sitcom with a ""Romeo and Juliet"" theme. In the first scene Bernard Sparrow (Kris Kristofferson) dies, which I found amusing because I thought K.K. was already dead. Queen Latifah, who was the assistant choir director takes over the top position. G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton), who was married to Bernard believes she should have the role because of all the pillow talk they shared and the fact her face does a pretty good Joan Rivers impersonation.

Dolly's long lost bad boy grandson (Jeremy Jordan) shows up out of nowhere and wants Olivia (Keke Palmer) to be his Juliet. Dexter Darden stars as Walter Hill, Olivia's brother who has Asperger's Syndrome. He is mono-focused on ""one hit wonders.""

The film has a number of wonderful scenes that work. Unfortunately it uses some dumb lines such as Dolly Parton at her husband's funeral, ""man had five kids, he must have loved something."" or ""[He is] so country he has married three times and has the same in-laws."" Dolly Parton has a distinctive voice. You know when she is singing and you know when she isn't i.e. just lip syncing as part of the chorus.

The movie had a few good dramatic scenes, but the film worked best when it is attempting to be a comedy. The only different between this a sitcom, is that in the sitcom they have to win to pay the mortgage or mom's operation. (Oh what are TV writers going to do once everyone has insurance?) Okay rental if you love TV sitcoms. Don't expect any come to Jesus moments. 4 stars maybe a little overrated, but I laughed at every close up they did of Dolly's face (she did this to herself.)

The bad boy becomes the hero only because he can choreograph good music, not because he's had a change of heart. We're supposed to just forget about the fact that he stalked and kidnapped the heroine. The ruthlessness of the competition for music designed to praise God is disturbing.

The music is definitely joyful and makes you want to buy the sound track. The feud between Queen Latifah's character and Dolly Parton's is quite funny.

The one person who realized that their singing should have been for the glory of God was portrayed as up-tight and hard nosed.  She was converted in the end and joined the others for the win.  The teenage daughter was encouraged to not be a ""Church girl"" and disobey her mom and do what she felt like.  The movie sent a very poor message.

5086883,4,B007HHWJD0,"I will admit that parts of the movie are on the boring side. And a lot could have been done to make this movie come up to par with the competition song hi-lite! The restaurant scene, with Dolly throwing biscuits at Queen Latifah, was a comedy scene that never flourished into what it should have. There is no way either character would have been that contained considering the feud. Of course, the feud was pretty dumb ... a poor woman's prejudice over a rich woman's money is basically rediculous, especially when the rich woman is basically a good christian that spreads her wealth within the church with no strings attached.

Dolly Parton, a legend ... no doubt ... is about to become another Mae West. Honestly, she is beginning to look a lot like Barbara Eden & Suzanne Somers looked in the early 2000s ... puffy comical. There are scenes where Dolly looks fanastic ... but there are also scenes where her face looks like it just may POP at any second. And that spiked hair-look is a total turn-off! Her fans still prefer her softer looks. Still ... she is worthy of her legend-status, and I never get tired of seeing her prance across the screen within our hearts.

The Romeo & Juliet parts of the movie ... with Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan ... were quite good. The interplay was often magical, and both are extra-ordinarily talented ... especially Jeremy Jordan.

Angela Grovey was a huge plus to the film ... though I kept praying she would not have a heart attack during her very heavy work during the competiton song routine, of which I think she was a little over the top with. Take some pounds off, girl, the world needs to keep you around for a whole lot longer than what is in your present future. Something that should have been said to John Candy too.

I was disappointed when it came to the scene time for two great actors that were not used to their full potential ... Kris Kristofferson & Jesse L. Martin.

But ... the best part of the movie is the competition production. I find myself rewinding a lot to see that production over and over again. It flowed like honey through most of it. The only real disappointment being Dolly's spiked hair-do, and puffy face.

All in all ... doesn't come close to being as good as Sister Act ... with the exception of the compettion section ... but ... still good entertainment.

5086886,4,B007HHWJD0,"Pacashau Sacred Divinity Choir has lost their choir master, Bernard Sparrow, and they need someone to replace him. G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton) feels she's better qualified, but the church council gives the position to Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah). The church has entered The National Joyful Noise Competition four years in a row, always getting to the regional semi-finals but never making it to the finals. Because of the bad economy, people in the small town of Pacashau are really counting on the choir to win this time.

I laughed quite a bit watching this movie. I don't think Vi Rose and G.G. got along even before the church council's decision. The bickering between the two of them was funny.  And the scene by the hotel elevator: I know Vi Rose was serious, and I was glad she got around to telling Olivia what she needed to hear, but some of the things she said to her daughter made me laugh. But the funniest part of the movie was the pep talk Vi Rose gave the choir after Our Lady of Perpetual Tears performed. Queen Latifah does very well in comedic roles.

There were touching scenes: The talk Vi Rose had with her son, when G.G. sang `From Here to the Moon and Back' and when Vi Rose sang `Fix Me'.

There were lots of good lines - or some I could probably call folk sayings or words of wisdom. My favorites: When folks get too wrapped up in themselves, they make very small packages/People who ain't around make very few mistakes/God gives you girls so your mama can say, ""I told you so.""

I didn't expect Asperger's to be addressed. What a person with this syndrome goes through, what may be felt about the condition and the struggles - it was all very well done. Dexter Darden played Vi's son, Walter, and he gave a fine performance.

I didn't really care for G.G.'s grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan), and that's mostly because of the way he disrespected Vi and he was not a good influence on Olivia (Keke Palmer). I did not like his `church girl' remark; it was not a good message to send to teenage girls who care about living for Jesus. I guess Randy had his good moments, but the boy was a rebel. So, the young love thing - Randy's relationship with Olivia - would have been sweet, but it wasn't.

I liked the character Devonne (DeQuina Moore), because that habit she had was kinda cute and funny. It was nice to see Jesse L. Martin (Law & Order's Detective Ed Green) as Marcus Hill, Vi's husband. I liked the way his character was used to show the pressure a loving father and husband can feel during hard economic times. And I enjoyed seeing Kirk Franklin on stage.

Jeremy Jordan, Keke Palmer, Queen Latifah, Dolly Parton - there are good singing voices in this movie. The music is what I loved most, especially Vi Rose (Queen Latifah) singing ""Fix Me' and Our Lady of Perpetual Tears singing `That's The Way God Planned It' - the soloist, Ivan Kelley, Jr. is awesome!!!!  I had purchased those two songs before watching the Amazon Instant Video. After the movie I immediately purchased the soundtrack.

I didn't expect the profanity, but it didn't really bother me; however, the sex out of wedlock could have been handled differently. What I mean is, Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance) should have given Earla (Angela Grovey) a better, more godly response. And there were moments that reminded me of Sister Act 2, starring Whoopi Goldberg, and The Fighting Temptations, starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., but still, Joyful Noise is good, uplifting entertainment.

I love Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton since they usually take on wholesome messages but they all Get caught up in the Lure of Hollywood.  If it looks Great and Feels great it must be good! BUT it is all a distraction from the TRUTH.

James 4:4 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.  If you don't think Hollywood is the World you are deceived by the devil.  Pray that God will remove the veil.  We need more Hollywood people to stand up for Christ!  I am so proud of Kirk Cameron for His Stand!  We need more Hollywood people like Him!  I bet it is so difficult to leave once you are caught up in the glitz and glamor of it.  Join me in prayer for Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton and other Hollywood actors to rise up with courage and proclaim the truth instead of promoting the lies of Hollywood.

I was really disappointed in one scene where two teenage girls are discussing how every boy would be dead if they counted the ones who had sex before marriage.  Queen Latifah and Dolly should be ashamed of themselves to condone this fornicating message.  I am also tried of Hollywood making fun of Christians who try to live by Biblical principals and Not have sex before marriage.",1336867200,8,1417,4.4

The music reminds me of South Park Episode 709, where Cartman said gospel music is just love songs with ""Jesus"" thrown in a lot.

I have been a fan of Dolly Parton's music since I could remember and was anxious to see what kind of chemistry she would have with Queen Latifah. I must say that the two women really have a good chemistry, and I would love to see them in more movies together.

The film itself has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard before. I knew of Queen Latifah as a rapper, but did not know that she had a beautiful singing voice. She really shines here as does Dolly, who wrote some of the songs for the film.

As I said in my review of the soundtrack, the true stars are Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan. I absolutely love their duet on Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"". And Ms. Palmer totally sings her heart out on ""Man In The Mirror"".

I keep reading there are many similarities to ""Sister Act"", this may be true, but as a fan of the ""Sister Act"" films, I can say there is enough differences to make you love this film also. The fueding between Dolly & Queen's characters, are believable. Both want their church choir to succeed in the nationals but Latifah's character feels they should stick to the classic choir music they've been doing for years & Dolly think the Ideas of her Grandson, Randy, to make secular songs into religeous hymns is more modern and moving with the times.

5086918,3,B007HHWJD0,"January happens to be one of the worst months for film. Movie studios put out their least desirable films during January, and February, while smart audiences are still seeing the Oscar season movies. Having said that, Todd Graff's ""Joyful Noise"" isn't a bad movie. But there are many things that keep it from being a good movie. In the day and age where any musical film or television program is linked back to the still-popular-for-some-reason ""Glee"", a musical film has to work hard not to feel contrived and cliched. ""Joyful Noise"" isn't necessarily a musical film, but it provides sometimes exhilarating, sometimes insufferable musical numbers, none of which have to do with the story.

Queen Latifah plays Vi Rose Hill, a woman who is selected choir director for her rural-Georgia church, a decision that infuriates her wealthy nemesis, GG (Dolly Parton), who was also in the seemingly prestigious running for that position. GG's grandson (Jeremy Jordan) and Vi Rose's daughter (Keke Palmer) form an unlikely romance, but both of them happen to have pristine singing voices (surprise!), and they might (surprise!) have a shot at winning the big prize at the national ""Joyful Noise Competition"" this year.

Dolly Parton hasn't had a starring role in 20 years, and despite her questionable plastic surgery choices (which are no doubt milked to death in the film), she is fresh as ever. She is rowdy and hell-raising, but also sweet and sympathetic. She sings too! She has unusually great chemistry with Queen Latifah, who also does a very nice job. A movie solely about these two characters would likely receive an ""A"" rating from me, however, their chemistry isn't enough to make up for the film's multiple flaws.

The film tries to give its supporting characters something to do, and you can tell that it wants to make its characters multi-layered and well-developed, but with such bland and boring supporting characters (Palmer's Olivia and Jordan's Randy) it's hard to do that. You get the idea that they're just supposed to sit there and look pretty while the rest of the story happens around them. The 25+ minutes of story devoted to their romance easily could have been cut down. The problem is, it does not feel authentic at all.

In a day where religion is taboo, I give ""Joyful Noise"" a lot of credit for being sure of its faith. It's a decidedly Christian film, with more than just momentary mentions of the fact that it IS about a church. While I applaud the film for not dancing around its religious background, that's kind of what killed it for me. It treats religion in a potently preachy and pushy way, which I foresee turning off a lot of audience members. It turned me off.

But worse than the films preachy religious aspect is the ""Glee"" aspect. Like I said, a movie musical has to work hard nowadays to not be compared to ""Glee"". This film features the sketchy acting by younger cast members, which simply screams ""Glee"". This film also features self-confident and unnecessary songs which must have seemed better on paper. The film even has the narration of singers vocalizing, which is constantly heard in ""Glee"". I hate that! If this film had a better screenwriter, maybe it could have avoided some of these mistakes? Who knows.

As I said, Latifah and Parton are in top form and are delightful to watch together. A film centered on the two characters, without all of the background drama would probably be more engaging. A big gripe I had was that it didn't have nearly enough Dolly Parton. I feel like she's there just to have jokes directed towards her about her nips and tucks. All of the plastic-surgery jokes aimed at her get old very fast. In short, it is a watchable January release and a decent way to spend a couple hours, but it could have (and should have) been miles better.

5086919,4,B007HHWJD0,"Set in the small town of Pacashau, Georgia, JOYFUL NOISE follows the members of a church choir as they attempt to win the national ""Joyful Noise"" gospel choir competition. G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton) is the chief benefactor of her church and when her husband, the choir director (Kris Kristofferson) suddenly passes away, she believes she will be made the new director. Instead the church board gives the position to Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah), Gi Gi's nemesis. There's some infighting that becomes more interesting when Gi Gi's grandson Randy (Jeremy Jordon) comes to live with her and falls in love with Vi Rose's daughter, Olivia (Keke Palmer).

JOYFUL NOISE features Dolly Parton's return to the big screen in a major role after a long absence (beyond a few cameos and a vocal cameo in GNOMEO AND JULIET, Parton hasn't been on the big screen since 1992). Welcome back, Dolly! Don't stay away so long next time.

Parton and Queen Latifah have a great onscreen chemistry. I'd love to see another movie that features these two women as co-stars.

Some of the supporting actors give so solid performances too, particularly Dexter Darden as Vi Rose's son, Walter. Walter has Asperger's Syndrome and Darden's portrayal of the character is particularly moving.

There's a lot of music in JOYFUL NOISE. That's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because it provides the audience with an opportunity to hear some of the wonderful voices of the cast. It's a bad thing because many of the songs in the film are unnecessary and don't do anything to drive the plot or develop the characters. Dolly sings the song ""From Here to the Moon"" and Queen Latifah sings ""Fix Me Jesus"". These songs are beautiful and it gives these unbelievably talented performers an opportunity to sing a solo. Unfortunately, they aren't necessary to the film. There are several other songs like this in the movie. In this aspect, JOYFUL NOISE attempts to copy the formula from the tv show ""Glee"". I know that ""Glee"" has been a successful tv show. However, the ""Glee"" formula really doesn't work in Christian-setting with mostly gospel music (heck, the ""Glee"" formula doesn't really even work on tv anymore).

I didn't think I was going to like JOYFUL NOISE very much. I've never been much a fan of gospel music. When I saw the movie with family, the main thing I was looking forward to was seeing Dolly (I've been a fan of hers since I was a kid). Despite the ""Glee""-vibe during certain moments and some unnecessary musical numbers, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed JOYFUL NOISE. There are some really touching moments that are grounded in reality: the death of a close love one, the economic downturn, and the struggle against loneliness, and the existence of God are issues that most everyone can relate. JOYFUL NOISE deals with these issues and though it does so in an optimistic and joyful way, it's doesn't feel false. The movie does have some foul language and there are some sexual references, so there will be some who will be turned off by that. However, if you don't mind a Christian-themed movie and can deal with some ""Glee""-inspired motifs, JOYFUL NOISE is a movie that might leave you with a joyful heart.",1333324800,4,3210,4.766187050359712
5086920,5,B007HHWJD0,"I won't repeat the plot because the other reviewers have done an excellent job of that.  But I would like to add that this movie is very uplifting and joyful.

I was impressed by one scene in particular.  Queen Latifah's son has a medical condition that he was born with.  He asks his mother if she loved him why doesn't she hate God -- who made him this way.  Her answer was definitely spot on.

The music is great although most of it is secular music transferred to a gospel choir, much like Sister Act.  I thoroughly enjoyed the music!

I enjoyed this movie immensely and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good family movie with great music.  :)",1332806400,14,656,4.355371900826446

When the church council chooses Queen Latifa to replace the choir director, some added tension develops between the ladies. (I say ""added"" tension, because there was some anyway.)  The story line is cute, funny and touching. There is even some love.  It also teaches a few lessons along the way.  The music is wonderful!  Very clap-your-hands uplifting. I found myself wiggling and tapping my foot throughout the movie.  It was money well spent.",1331942400,13,555,4.903225806451613

My only downfall was there is so unneccessry language... especially the BS words between Mom and daughter... the other kinda slide by... I cant wait to come see it on DVD..

5086925,5,B007HHWJD0,"Dolly Parton made her first film in 20 years in ""Joyful Noise"", a movie filled with music, love, young romance and a great on-screen war between two of music's most beloved singers Dolly and Queen Latifah.

 The film opened in January, 2012 and became a box office hit making nearly $31,000,000 as of March 7, 2012. Critics and fans of both Dolly and Queen Latifah have enjoyed the movie tremendously. The film comes to BluRay and DVD formats on May 1, 2012.

 The story deals with a woman named G.G. Sparrow whose husband (played by Kris Kristofferson) recently dies. Upon his death G.G. believes she will lead the Church's Choir until she is told the congregation has decided that Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah) would be better suited for the job. That is when the war starts between these two dames with insults, name-calling and a fabulous food fight scene which takes place in a restaurant that took two days to film.

 There is also a young romance brimming between G.G.'s grandson and Vi's daughter that is both emotional and touching.

 The music to the film is produced by none other than Mervyn Warren who did the music for the ""Sister Act"" movies as well as ""The Preacher's Wife"". Both Dolly and Queen Latifah show off their vocal prowess and the young leads played by Jeremy Jordon and Keke Palmer are first-rate singers. The soundtrack became a certified hit and the music is simply outstanding. Dolly herself wrote three songs including the beautiful ""From Here To The Moon And Back"", a song she wrote for her real-life husband.

 The Blu Ray will have a slew of bonus features including the featurettes ""Spotlight on a Song: Dolly Parton's 'From Here To The Moon And Back'"", ""Inspiration of Joyful Noise"", ""Make Some Noise"", ""Leading Ladies"", extended songs and a digital version of the movie for download.

 In March, 2012 Dolly Parton talked with a Singapore newspaper about how she and others involved with ""Joyful Noise"" were disappointed with the film's box office performance. Dolly stated, ""The movie was not as big as we hoped it would be. But you go into every project hoping it's going to be a hit. Of course, not everything is. Sometimes your shocked, sometimes your surprised, sometimes things that you don't think will be that big turn out to be a big hit. And it was a joyful time for me.""

 Special features include interviews with the cast and crew.",1331078400,47,2378,4.72639225181598
5086926,5,B007HHWJD0,Really they're really no words to express my feeling towards this movie. I laughed and cried through it. It was very extremely awesome. It's been a long time that I've seen a really good clean movie.,1330214400,,199,4.555555555555555
5086927,2,B007HHWJD0,"""The music and acting are both great, especially from Queen Latifah. There's not a bad song to be heard, and I'd almost recommend seeing the movie just for the music itself, if you didn't have to sit through the rest of the ""noise."" That being said, just skip this show and go out and buy the soundtrack or download it from iTunes."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder

""...now that I think about it, I'm really not sure what ""Christian"" message I was supposed to take away from this viewing experience. The main message is to never give up, but you never see any of the characters praying to God to help them. This may be a movie about a church choir, but it seemed to me these characters were relying more on their own abilities than acknowledging they needed God's help."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-Founder

5086928,2,B007HHWJD0,"Behind the voices of Queen Latifah, Dolly Parton, Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan, ""Joyful Noise"" is able to hold its own as a worthwhile trip to the Cineplex. Although a predictable script and over-lengthy over-dramatics, keeps it from really shining.

""Joyful Noise"" is centered around a gospel choir that struggles to break through, as they fall short in the national Joyful Noise competition, year after year. When their choir leader suddenly dies, Vi Rose Hill (Latifah) and G.G. Sparrow (Parton) struggle over the reigns to the group. Meanwhile, Vi Rose tries to keep her family together and keep her daughter from falling head over heels for Sparrow's son. The choir struggles between sprucing up their act so that they can break through the ceiling and finally win, or keeping with the old basic gospel act that they have grown accustom.

There are many side stories going on in ""Joyful Noise"" and while most of them are interesting, the movie mostly has an aimless feel to it. Of course the choir is working toward winning a national championship, but that seems to be a side note in the day in the life storylines that go on throughout. The script is not all that interesting and the acting is good in places and stiff in places.

There is a lot of good humor placed throughout the movie, in fact, some hilarious moments, but for the most part the movie sort of falls flat. Yet, when the choir is performing, the movie is anything but flat. Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan are beautiful singers and their renditions of Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" are truly outstanding.
In fact, every time that music is in the forefront during ""Joyful Noise"" the movie shines. It's just the things surrounding the music that could have used some sprucing, tightening and creativity.",1329177600,,1822,4.833333333333333
5086929,3,B007HHWJD0,"When a church choir director dies, his wife, G.G. (Dolly Parton) expects to take over, but the job is given to his assistant, Vi Rose (Queen Latifah).  They two become snarky enemies and things get worse when G.G.'s wild grandson moves to town and starts chasing Vi Rose's demure young daughter.

The plot is completely predictable, so how much you'll like it depends on your fondness for the stars and the R&B church music.  I like Latifah and thought she was excellent as the hardworking, lonely mother, but Parton has disfigured her mouth with too many procedures and it spoiled her performance for me.  Also, she isn't convincing at all; she just plays Dolly Parton with a smart mouth.  (By the way, everyone starts cussing by the end and there is some hanky-panky which makes this not suitable for children, in my opinion.)  Keke Palmer shines as Vi Rose's daughter; she's a charismatic actress and singer and quite beautiful. Kris Kristofferson phones in a brief appearance and sings (badly) a bit.

The story has the group preparing for a big choir competition which made it seem like a ""Glee"" episode. Will they make it to regionals?  Will they win?  Will they all be friends?  Not to worry, of course.  The singing was lively and infectiously happy and made up the movie's best scenes.  All in all, this is just an okay movie.",1327622400,3,1335,4.706896551724138

5086933,5,B007HHWJD0,"""Joyful Noise"" is a heartwarming movie that underscores the message of various people having more in common than what originally thought.  Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah magnificently play two women(G.G. Sparrow and Vi Rose Hill) who start out as rivals for leadership in their church choir.  However, they unexpectedly become friends as events unfold to bring out their shared goal (helping their congregation win a national competition).  For example, Vi Rose Hill has a daughter by the name of Olivia Hill (played by Keke  Palmer) and G.G.  Sparrow has a grandson by the name of Randy Garrity (played by Jeremy Jordan).  Olivia Hill and Randy Hill fall in love with each other.  Naturally, Vi Rose Hill and G.G. Sparrow are forced to act more civil towards each other just with this event, in addition to other circumstances that pop up.  The movie is also supported well by other various characters that help these two women in their quest for a church choir that can qualify to win the nationals.  ""Joyful Noise"" is recommended for the many who enjoy uplifting movies.",1326499200,4,1073,4.916666666666667
5086934,4,B007HHWJD0,"""This town is so small you can be married three times and still have all the same in-laws!"" This is a teeny sample of the kind of corn-pone, good-natured humor you will enjoy.

Full disclosure: I have never been a big fan of Gospel music...but this movie could change my mind. We are with a small-town choir that competes in regional and national competitions, so we see thrilling choreography and hear terrific music. Each time a number ends we think, ""How can they beat THAT?""

Here is the top tier of talent:

  *Dolly Parton (""Nine to Five""), whose character is widowed during the opening credits. She fully expects to take the place of her choir director husband after his fatal heart attack. Her solo is so sweet..... Remember she has earned multiple Grammy Awards.
  *Queen Latifah (""The Secret Life of Bees"") gets that coveted position of choir director instead. This only increases the bad blood between Parton's wealthy widow and Latifah's single mom. Her solo is poignant..... Remember, she too, has been honored by the Grammys.
  *Keke Palmer (""Akeelah and the Bee"") is the talented daughter of that new choir director. Her mother can't accept her daughter's burgeoning maturity, while SHE can't accept her parents' separation. I LOVE her Face in the Mirror solo!
  *Jeremy Jordon, primarily a stage actor (""Newsies"" and ""West Side Story"") plays the widow's grandson. He lands back in this little burg after his mother kicks him out. He spent his childhood here, so he already knows that talented daughter! BTW, this actor is a FIND! He sings, he dances, he acts and he's good-looking!
  *Courtney B. Vance (""Final Destination 5"") is the minister of the local church. He wants what is best for the church, the town, and his parishioners, but he has to balance the budget, too.
  *Kris Kristofferson (""Dolphin Tale"") makes a couple of cameos as the soon-dead choir director.

There are so many other outstanding actors, it's a shame I don't have more room. Suffice it to say, you will come to know everyone in the choir and you will delight in each person's moment to shine. And the cat-fights between Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah are a pure joy. Both are so likable and the dialog is so good, you'd like them to go on and on.

This PG-13 movie has a little more (mild) profanity than I expected, but it's done in such a good-spirited way, I can't be too upset. We see no sweaty bodies, vehicular mayhem (watch Grandma Dolly drive!), gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. We see lots of decent people trying to bring some pride to a little town that has had its share of hard knocks.

When I watch a movie, I always want someone to root for. This one gives us a whole town full of worthy folks. What a pleasure. ""Joyful Noise"" is a pulse-quickening joy!

5086935,5,B007HHWJD0,"I couldn't have asked for a better movie expeience. The music was outstanding. OK, so the plot wasn't all that original, but everything about this movie made me feel good. The conflict was minimal and even funny at times. Again, the music was marvelous, especially the songs ""Fix Me, Jesus"" and ""To The Moon And Back"". The songs with the choir were also outstanding! I couldn't wait to download the music when I returned home, and will definitely buy the DVD. ""Gone with the Wind"" it isn't, but neither is it ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". The language: Well, I wouldn't have used some of the words, but it wasn't all that bad, so I ignored it.
