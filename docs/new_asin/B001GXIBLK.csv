If you don't have it, haven't heard it...GET it...you will be so very glad you did, especially if you truly enjoy old-time gospel music.  This tape, imagine it on a CD, and ride all over town in worship.  I drove back home--over 8 hours and I never got tired of it...it really is that good.  If you know somebody who likes Old Fashion Gospel...get the tape for them, they will be delighted, too. Blessed2Bless...Good Old Gospel Songs",1230595200,,522,4.580645161290323
