8417686,1,B0006UZJ4Q,I am not sure if its because I only saw 1/4 of the play that I did not like it or because the seller did not let it be known that only the beginning fo the play was being sent or what-but I would not recomment this to anyone to add to their library of Plays. its so out of the realm of a true God filled Church.
