3714576,4,B000KP62FC,I really liked the morality of the story.  I enjoyed the various characters and naturally the ending.  Keep in mind this is a dated movie so I'd your fond of that genre I believe you'll like it.  I laughed at the music and it is a bit corny but I dig moral movies.,1425513600,2,264,3.943396226415094

3714582,3,B000KP62FC,"The only reason I will give this three stars is because Mr. T is in it.  The movies storyline is nice. The acting is subpar and quality is low.  If you like movies where Mr. T is a nice guy and gets to beat a few people up and be athletic, you'll like the movie.  If not, pass on it.",1401926400,2,283,3.683333333333333

3714586,1,B000KP62FC,Do not waste your time with this movie unless you like delightfully bad movies. Must have had a budget of $4. Could only stand 20 minutes before I skipped through the rest quickly to see if it got any better. it didn't,1393113600,,218,4.214285714285714

3714592,5,B000KP62FC,"Im not sure why Mr. T or the movie itself did not win any awards. An  Oscar for best actor or  best picture. It is entertaining though, and funny in an odd way, oh how times change.",1385769600,3,181,3.864864864864865
