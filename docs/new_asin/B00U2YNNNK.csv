8704139,1,B00U2YNNNK,Horrible.  Don't waste your $$ on this.  It's a bunch of boring radio interviews. My 9y.o. daughter is a huge TS fan (so am I) and we couldn't sit through this.,1432252800,7,160,4.129032258064516
8704140,1,B00U2YNNNK,"My 5 year old daughter was close to tears after watching this DVD.  She was so excited to see Taylor (but not in 3 boring interviews).  ""Journey To Fearless"" is the best buy.",1432080000,6,174,4.242424242424242
8704141,1,B00U2YNNNK,"I love Taylor Swift!  But this (may I add unauthorized) DVD only has 3 interviews by unknown interviewers.  There is no music, and no story about Taylor's Life On Stage, as the title implies.  This is one DVD you will watch one time, and one time only.  No need to re-watch it.  I have Journey to Fearless, and the Speak Now DVD.  They are both awesome.  I have watched them multiple times.  Get those instead!  Don't waste $10 on this one.",1431993600,12,440,4.333333333333333
