2408966,5,B000B8QFY6,"Raven's House Party is real cool, because it makes me wanna get up and dance. That's a good quality in a TV show.

  First, Raven, Chelsea, and Eddie volunteer in a nursing home. Chelsea meets an old lady with a strong arm and tries her best to beat her in arm wrestling. Eddie learns how people dressed back in the day. Raven meets an old jazz singer. At first, she's not so pleasant, but Rae realizes that she's sad because she got to play everywhere with everyone, except for at her daddy's club. Raven makes her wish come true.

 Next, Raven and Chelsea find out that Pressure is going to be at this rec. place where you only can hang if you're in Pressure's rehersal a dance rehersal for young boys or waiting for them. Raven tricks Cory into going to be in the dance rehersal which turns out to be the worst exprierience of his life. He gets her back though.

Then, Chelsea organizes a vegitarian party, and she tells Raven and Eddie about her crush on a boy named Ben. Right after, Raven has a crush on Ben.  Finally, Raven is trying to impress Presto (a Russell Simmons type of man, played by James Avery AKA Uncle Phil on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) on her products, so is everyone else. At the same time, she's trying to get this annoying girl named Sierra off her back.

Extra

The Quiz Game

  It was challenging but I mastered it. It's fun, although the voice is so annoying.

Vision Impossible

  Raven's having weird visions. The psychic doctor makes a house call. This is a flashback episode

Overall, this is the best one so far that I've seen",1155600000,,1557,4.388111888111888
