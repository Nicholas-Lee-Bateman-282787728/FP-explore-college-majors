761012,5,6303968651,"I can't remember the first time I saw this wonderful film, but I know that I will watch it many times more.  I think it is one of the most moving, evocative stories about childhood that I know.  It is, in my opinion, an  authentic vision of childhood retreat into an inner world that is free of  mean parents, bullies, and scornful teachers.  The last scene is a great  symbol for the escape from the loneliness and pain of growing up that many  children experience. I believe that adults as well can surely empathize  with the little boy in the story as he tries to make his way in the world  that seems so cruel.  This film is a real classic.",911779200,75,644,4.24793388429752

761112,5,6303968651,"This is a book (and film) very close to my heart. It's about how our imagination can save us. No matter how many times we are let down, hurt, or fail to get our needs or wants to be met in the outside world, our imagination is there, safe, beyond harm, ready to come to the rescue. Kids who discover this will have a well of resiliency to draw from for their entire lives. The good news is that even as adults, it's never too late to rediscover what saved us as children.",1506038400,,471,4.075268817204301
761113,5,6303968651,"I first saw this delightful film by Albert Lamorisse at the one art theater in Atlanta in the 1970s. Even showing it was a bit of an act of love, since the financial incentives played against it. Half an hour in length, it was not a stand alone movie. It had to be a leader for another film, which just might have stood alone itself. Fortunately, George didn't usually think that way. He really loved good movies and felt compelled to share, and educate. Now this movie, and so many other short movies can stand on their own, being downloaded at the viewers convenience.

I must have seen the movie five times, and read the book, in French,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Ballon-Rouge-French-edition-of-34-The-Red-Balloon-34/dp/2211039995/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Ballon Rouge (French edition of ""The Red Balloon""</a>&nbsp;to my children ten times. It was a favorite. It was first released in 1956, the end of the first decade of les annees trente glorious, the 30 years of glorious economic development in France after the Second World War. Things still appeared a bit shabby, with the building facades and shutters unfinished and unpainted for so many years, still, and often enveloped in smog. The film was shot in Paris, in the M&eacute;nilmontant section, which is in the 20th arrondissement, on the hill, near Pere Lachaise and Belleville, which provides scenic backdrops of the central portion of the city. The buses had standing platforms on the back, which were phased out by the time of my first visit in 1971 (how many people fell off before the phase out?) Tis a shame, since I always considered that an essential part of the Parisian experience. And all the people in the movie were white, and not by selection, since there were numerous street scenes. The movie commences with Pascal petting a street cat.

Many a kid has developed an attachment for a teddy bear, or another stuffed animal. Pascals attachment is for a very bright large helium balloon; the attachment is anthropomorphically reciprocated. A special relationship that a lot of adults, and even other kids try to thwart. His mother throws it out the window. The bus conductor will not allow it on the bus. And the school principal, grim and humorless, as are so many, goes berserk, as the balloon threatens his dignity. Pascal does receive a couple minutes of playful empathy from a girl his age carrying a blue balloon.  Ah, and then there is the horrible jealousy of ones peers, and it was in this book that I learn the literal and more metaphorical meaning of voyous. A glorious fantasy ending, that I had to puzzle as to how it was actually filmed.

Albert Lamorisse utilized his own children Pascal and Sabine in this film. In reviewing his bio I learned that he was the creator of the game of Risk, which I have played many a time in my own youth. Albert Lamorisse died at the age of 48, in 1970, in a helicopter crash during the filming of a film, The Lovers Wind (Le Vent des amoureux) in Iran. His wife and Pascal would finish and release the film eight years later. 5-stars plus for this marvelous legacy.",1502841600,2,3145,4.91713747645951

761633,5,6303968651,"This short film is a story of demonic possession as visited upon an innocent young person. The child comes across a red helium balloon inexplicably tethered to a lamp post. As most children would, he takes the plaything for his own, not realizing the insidious nature hidden within. All adults in the film instantly recognize its' evil quality and when he takes it into his home, the maid immediately banishes it out the window. But the balloon defies the laws of God and science and will not leave him. It follows the child wherever he goes, ignoring admonitions to stay away. When the child goes to school, the balloon enters this school on its' own and gets the child thrown out. When he goes in public with it, the adults around him recognize the evil and give him stern looks, but in his possessed rapture he is blind to any of this. Ultimately he is set upon by a mob of other children, not unlike medieval villagers who have discovered a witch or warlock in their midst. The other children are faithful to their Bible and stone the balloon until it dies. But the evil does not die with the balloon. Fed by the soul of its' young victim, the nefarious spirit takes control of every helium balloon in the city and assembles them. The child grasps them all at once and is carried away; away from home, away from school, away from all that is good and just in this world, all that is sacred. The Devil has triumphed.

Didn't even know the balloon was red apart from the title. Such was the indelible impression this short flick made that week after week I would check back with the same program in the hopes that I would catch more films in the same class or even a rerun of ""The Red Balloon.""

762210,5,6303968651,"Childhood is a beautiful thing.  It is full of excitement and wonderment and an innocence that is a shame to see slip through a child's plush little fingers.  When I look at my eldest daughter, now three, and her lavish lust for life I can't help but wish it would linger longer than I know it will.  That seems harsh, I'm sure, since adolescence does take its time (she's only three for Christ sake) but I'm only twenty-five and my life is already a bowl of exasperation.  Gone are the days of spinning in circles and curious stares at nature and endless storytelling huddled in the closet of my room surrounded by countless stuffed animals.  Gone are the days of reckless imagination and boundless curiosity.

I'm an adult.

Yuck.

I'm often fascinated by theatrical depictions of childhood, good and bad, since there are so many layers to the mind of a child and it is impressive to me when a film understands how to capture and cultivate those layers.  In recent years I have been moved, quite emphatically, by a few films; most notably `Where the Wild Things Are' (for so many reasons it's pathetic).  The other night I happened to catch a film barely over thirty minutes in length that spoke so vividly about the world of a child with barely a whisper (the dialog in the film is so limited that it was classified a silent film by TCM).  That film was `The Red Balloon' or `Le Ballon Rouge'.  This thirty-four minute short film by Albert Lamorisse starring none other than his very own son Pascal is a beautifully intoxicating film that navigates the rich innocence (birth and death) of a child with stark significance.

The film simply tells the story of a boy who finds a balloon and spends the day protecting it.  It follows him around and listens to him.  The other boys in his neighborhood want to destroy the balloon and the adults in his life want to discipline him for having it.

Pascal loves the balloon.

As I mentioned earlier, childhood is so layered.  There is no real cut and dry answer as to the meaning of this film, for life is rarely that black and white.  Some have noted they felt the film spoke of escape from the loneliness of childhood; mean parents and bullies and the like.  I understand that viewpoint completely.

For me though, `Le Ballon Rouge' is more about growing up and leaving childhood behind.  That balloon is a representation of all the dreams and aspirations we have in our youth.  When you are young everything seems possible.  You can be anything you want to be, and most parents try to enforce that idea in the minds of their children.  How often though, does life work out that way?  Having those ideals is a beautiful thing, but a certain air of realism comes into play as we age, and before we know it we have completely disregarded the life we once dreamed we'd live and settle into the more realistic, the more attainable; the more `normal' life.  Look at the way the slightly older children regard the balloon.  The pawn over it, chase after it, seek to destroy it.  The adults in Pascal's life look down on the balloon and it's presence as a burden, going as far as to discipline Pascal for entertaining the idea of `the balloon'.  It is almost as if the people around him will stop at nothing to destroy his dreams.

And then the dream is killed.

`Le Ballon Rouge' offers us a glimmer of hope though, as we watch Pascal find new dreams shortly after his balloon is deflated.  In a flurry, balloons from all over rush to the aid of their dying friend and then surround young Pascal, adopting him as their own and causing him to soar to new heights (quite literally).

The beauty of `Le Ballon Rouge' comes in the resolve that dreams don't HAVE to die.  As I mentioned, all too often we give up on those dreams, shucking them aside to live a more acceptable life.  That isn't to say that adulthood is a series of painful moments and a swell of regret.  In fact, I wouldn't trade my life for anything (despite the frustrated responsibilities that dull my enjoyment of everyday).  Still, as parents we feel obligated to put our children's futures on a pedestal, desiring them to become something more than we ever could dream of becoming.  In a way, I feel that this is what Lamorisse was doing with this film.  Youth is beautiful.  It is exciting and charming and new and daring.  Youth is inspiring, and Lamorisse didn't want Pascal to lose that part of himself.  `Le Ballon Rouge' broaches the realities of youthful dreams with the hopefulness that those dreams don't have to leave us entirely as we get older.  It's a mindset; an approach we take to life.

Maybe we need to broaden our understanding of what a 'dream' really is.

We may let go of our balloon, or we may have it shot down and trampled by those around us...but if that happens we need to find ourselves another balloon.

I had put off seeing this because it sounded hilariously boring. (In fact, I believe that the old tv show ""The Critic"" had this movie as part of some kind of joke, insisting that it was the eponymous critic's favorite movie to exemplify his pomposity.) I wound up watching it the other day late at night because it was short and I wouldn't stay up...and was definitely wide awake afterwards. I won't go into too much detail about what happens in the film because it's so short, but I will say that I found it very enjoyable and I will watch it again sometime to get a better look at the effects used in giving the balloon personality, as well as the final scene. I'd say that the last scene, which is both a surprise and visually stunning, has been aped by the Bravia advertisements and innumerable directors. It's really unforgettable and even a bit shocking - quite refreshing for someone who has grown inured to CGI and other cinematic trickery.

DVD print: I thought it was clear and the colors came across well, but the person watching it with me said the faces were a bit muddy and some of the scenery too dark.

762374,5,6303968651,"Interestingly, this film preceded ""Old Yeller"" by one year. As well as being enduring childhood classics, those two tales have certain themes in common, but whereas ""Old Yeller"" deals with a living creature, this tale breathes life into a normally inanimate object.
 My first encounter with ""Le Ballon Rouge"" was when it was shown to my kindergarten class in the mid-70s. I had no idea until years later that by that time, it was nearly 20 years old. Its appeal, nonetheless, is timeless.
 Using sparse dialogue, and Parisian locales, Director Albert Lamorisse presents the tale of a small boy (his son,Pascal)who finds a magical red balloon tied to a lamp post, and takes it home with him. Largely gray Paris gives the redness of the balloon an interesting and sharp onscreen contrast.
 Like a faithful dog, the the air-filled sphere with a string follows him everywhere, often on its own, and with an occasional exception, waits for him outside places where it is not allowed to enter. It obeys its master's commands, attracts attention in public, and has a brief flirtation with a blue balloon of a similar caliber, owned by a pretty little girl (the director's daughter, Sabine).
 But alas, the adventures of boy and balloon are abreviated due to a rowdy group of boys. But it is as though the balloon knew its time was short somehow, as if it knew it was meant to give its owner delight only for a little while and did so to the fullest. There would be other delightful times and other magical balloons, but always one special one that would be remembered fondly.
 The little boy's heartbreak is happily short-lived in this sweet tale of friendship, loss, and renewal, and viewers may be left moved and satisfied, perhaps with a few sentimental tears.",1223510400,,1756,4.801324503311259

762382,5,6303968651,"""The Red Balloon"" is probably the most charming short film ever made. That's not easy to say, of course. But the simple storyline, understated acting, and pathos of ""Red Balloon"" make it a delight to watch in a way that few films are.

The story concerns a young boy who gets a large red balloon, which has a mind of its own. The balloon follows its new owner around Paris, and will stay when asked to. It even pursues a love interest at one point. Unfortunately, some ruffians want to destroy the balloon, possibly out of jealousy. The balloon is good at evasion, however, and the viewer is kept in suspense. The action culminates in a bittersweet conclusion which I won't reveal here. In just 34 minutes, the viewer actually develops feelings for the balloon and the boy.

Those of a Christian bent might read a Calvary reference into the end portion of the film.

762465,5,6303968651,"When I was a wee little shaver growing up in the 1970's, I remember seeing this movie in school. It would've been, oh, about 1978 or 1979. Around the time I was in the 2nd grade. I don't remember a lot from that time of my life (it was, after all, a very long time ago). But I remember this movie! Heck, I even remember owning, of all things, a book that had stills from the movie with captions explaining what was going on. So, yeah, it was an important film for me when I was growing up.

""The Red Balloon"", for those who don't know, is the simple story of a very young boy who finds a balloon tied to a lamppost. He unties it and it wanders around with him, apparently at least as smart as a dog. Things go well for our young hero until a group of bullies decide the want the balloon for themselves.

It's amazing to look at this film now and realize how much it colored my impressions of France in general, and Paris in particular. To this day, when I think of Paris, I still tend to think of it in the vaguely grey, post-war scences shown in this movie. Rationally, I know Paris today is nothing like what we see here, but I think until I finally visit the place, this movie will loom large as my primary image of what the city is.

As an adult, I appreciate a lot I didn't see about the movie when I was a kid. The color scheme is mostly various shades of grey, except for the balloon; a bright red splash of color in a drab landscape. Later in the movie we see dozens of other balloons in a rainbow of color, flying out over the grey city. It's a very striking image, and the picture looks spectacular. Obviously a lot of time and effort was spent restoring the film stock. It looks like it could've rolled out to theatres yesterday.

I was also surprised at how touched by the story I was, even now. Amazed to find myself actually in tears at the end of it, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've cried at a movie (for the curious, the only two others I can think of off the top of my head are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-I-Artificial-Intelligence-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXXP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic-Three-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000ANVQ0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic (Three-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>, though in the case of ""AI"", the tears stopped rolling during the ""WTF?"" bit with the future robots. That movie should've ended with the boybot under the water, endless pleading with the Blue Fairy). I don't know what it was about this movie that set me off, but it did.

Some words here about the extras on this DVD. Those words are, ""What extras?""

Now, given that it's a very short film, I wasn't expecting much. But would it have been too terribly difficult for them to throw in, say, interviews with people involved, visits to the sites today, and maybe a retrospective from some modern filmmakers who might cite this movie as inspiration? Frankly, I expected better from a DVD that has the word ""Criterion"" on it. Yes, I know it was released by Janus films, but if Critierion is going to have their name on it, it should at least come close to being up to their usual standards.

That said, this movie is a great value for the price. I have no regrets in buying it, and I'm very pleased it's being preserved for future generations, and people like me, to enjoy.",1211328000,2,3890,5.12776025236593

For the beginners: ""The Red Balloon"" is one of the most beloved children films in history and a great example of pure cinema: 32 minutes of action, music and only a few words.

No doubt the sobering experience of growing up has added to the richness & depth of the deceptively simple story, which has the purity & directness of a parable. There's so much here! The innocence of childhood, the defiance of unfeeling authoriy, the individual vs. the mob, the power of the imagination -- and all of it told with a subtle touch that's as light as a feather. There's nothing heavy-handed or maudlin here. Pascal is treated with the dignity a sensitive child deserves, without any false sentimentality or condescension. And the ending is magnificent!

Restored to its full Technicolor glory, drenched in color, and taking us on a wide-eyed tour of Paris in the 1950s, this Criterion release is a treasure.

In some ways, the final chase scene is quite frightening, yet I am sure that many a kid could still relate to it. I think the final escape scene is every bullied child's fantasy.

You don't have to have been bullied or have major issues to enjoy this film. The story overall is quite charming. And the ballons are as much fun as the people, if not more at times. The images of Paris have a sacral-idyllic quality to them while seeming pleasantly ordinary at the same time.

This is the version to go for and when you see it, you'll see just how wonderful the film looked originally to those 1950's cinema audiences of long ago. Pascal Lamorisse is totally enchanting. He reminds me of myself as a five or six years old boy and I can identify with him only too well. This is, without the slightest doubt, the best children's film of all time.

Critique: For me, the charming little '56 French film `The Red Balloon' carries with it fond memories of grammar school. Whenever it was too rainy outside for recess the student body would be gathered into the cafeteria to watch a short film or a couple of cartoons. Without question the film most requested by the young audience was `The Red Balloon.'

It had been at least forty years since my last viewing of this childhood classic. I'm happy to say that it still possesses all the charm and childhood wonder as it had upon its initial release fifty years ago. Looking at the streets of Paris as they were in the mid-fifties is a delight all its own serving as a mini-time capsule of a more innocent, nave time in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

I learned later this film won an Oscar that year (1956) for Best Foreign Film.  The actor I believe I read was the directors son.  He is magical and accounts for much of the joy in the film.  While captivated and engrossed immediately in the film I thought the ending way too harsh and unnecessary.  But then look at Dumbo or Bambi.  It seems the movies that make the most sharp and lasting impressions are ones that involve loss.  Only now in my 50's can I see the director was putting an overview of life on film - it always involves moments of intense passion, periods of devotion, and inevitably loss.

As I write this on 16-Apr-2008, [But See Below!] this DVD has not yet been released, so I obviously am not reviewing the actual DVD itself. However, I just saw ""The Red Balloon"" on our local cable system (that's why I'm on this page!). What MEMORIES that film brings back! And what an ADORABLE story! As you watch it, DO look for one of THE most memorable scenes in the film, early on, when the Boy (about six years old) leaves school to find the Balloon waiting for him. It's raining, so the Boy dashes from passerby to passerby, each of whom graciously shelters his Balloon beneath their umbrellas! I swear, that has GOT to be one of THE Cutest, THE Sweetest, and THE Most Adorable scene in any short film, EVER!  :)

Additional post-review NOTES:

1. I did finally purchased this DVD on Thu., 17-Apr-2008.

2. The original French title to this film is ""Le Ballon Rouge"", which (for a wonder) means exactly and precisely what the English title says it is, except that in French, as in many languages, the adjective follows the noun instead of preceeding it, so if you REALLY want to be literal, it's ""The Balloon Red"".

3. According to the liner notes, the Boy's name is Pascal, and he was six years old at the time of filming.",1208304000,5,1541,5.347107438016529

Simply put, this is one of the best short film ever made. No kidding. Put them all together and this film will easily be in the all-time top five. An absolute work of art!

It tells the beautiful story of a young boy and his only friend: a big red balloon. Their friendship is true and the living balloon follows the little boy wherever he goes. They play with each other, trust each other... they are together for good!

A very simple and beautiful story... one that makes you remember how good it is to be a kid. ...all the possibilities... all the imagination and the innocence we lose when we grow up. This film will touch everyone who sees it. The ending is unforgettable.

Congratulations to Criterion for releasing again (they released it previously on Laserdisc, many years ago), this time on DVD, such a magical film... restored to its full glory. All the Technicolor glory with beautiful colors that I am sure nobody who sees it will ever forget.

When he is unable to ride on the street car because the balloon is too large he is forced to walk to his destination. His new acquisition is soon noticed by a group of bullies who desire the balloon for themselves and a chase ensues. Will the boy get away with his balloon intact? What eventually happens is both bittersweet and unexpected. It's truly the stuff from which delightful day dreams are made.

Critique: For me, the charming little '56 French film `The Red Balloon' carries with it fond memories of grammar school. Whenever it was too rainy outside for recess the all the students would be gathered into the cafeteria to watch a short film, or a cartoon or two. Without question the film most requested by the audience was `The Red Balloon.'

It had been at least forty years since my last viewing of this childhood classic when I sat down last week to view this All Region DVD release from Korea. The film still possesses all the childhood wonder as it had fifty years ago and now also serves as a mini-time capsule of Paris in more nave times. Unfortunately the picture quality is severely lacking and spoils much of the ambience the pictures on the screen so delicately create.

I saw it with my mother as a mere 21-year old lass; she must have been nearly 50. When the Balloon jerks away from the Little Boy as the Other Boys climb all over them, I said ""OH!

It left me with this feeling that I've never forgotten and I've often wondered If I would ever see it again.

Someone previously wrote that they thought the film was scary and sick that a balloon would follow a boy around.

That person has obviously missed the whole point of the film.

The boy had no brothers, sisters or friends.

Finally he finds something to fill the gap and finds friendship with the ballon.

It seems all the people in his life are harsh and mean.

He was so innocent that having a balloon as a friend was just natural, not scary.

Maybe that's what made it so magical to me as a child. The thought of befriending a big red ballon- how wonderful. And we all know what it felt like to let go of a ballon and have it float away! This one doesn't do that!

At the end all the ballons take him on a ride around the world. What an ending, it just made it all so great.

He had something no one else had. Truly magical and perfect for a young child with the imagination to believe and hope for the same thing to happen someday!

I will buy this even though one person wrote the quality was poor.

It helps stimulate the imagination, as well as show you how bad things are in the world, when you have something, and others will stop at nothing to get it.
When underpriveledged Pascal finds a large red balloon tied to a lamp post one early morning, he decides, why not take it with him to school. Things get complicated though. It seems as though the world around him is against balloons. He's not allowed to board the bus to school with it, the teacher won't allow it in the classroom, and his Mother bcomes mad at him for bringing it home. She soon throws it out the window, scolding him afterwords. But Pascal see's something out his bedroom window. It's the balloon! After bring it back in, he doesn't bother trying to figure out how it's alive, he's glad to have a friend finally, no matter who, or what it is. Maybe things won't be so bad after all. Or will they be?
Producer, and writer Albert Lammorise should've gotten a nomination for best film of the year in 1956. It's an instant five stars. After watching the film, I felt a void like all kids might for the red balloon after he got popped. But it turns out, there is a sequel, which one a film festival award called the revenge of the red balloon. It gives you satisfaction for the balloon is back, and he goes around making sure that none of the boys (now men) that popped him so long ago, never see another day of their lives.

The only problem is the print they used for this DVD. Absolutely horrible! Full of scratches and marks...

The soundtrack is also bad and the rich Technicolor is gone. I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen during the seventies and... believe me... it was beautiful. Nothing like this.
I knew this print was bad because I read the other reviews, and yet, I bought it because I felt I must have it (for I love this film). But it was still shocking to see how bad a bad print can be.
I think this film is a masterpiece and I will buy it again if this is ever restored and released again... but this is an european film and I do not see that (restoration... or a new print) coming soon. So I bought it anyway - think like this: not even in France this film is available... go figure why!

In these days of remastering and the ability to make a film look at least decent without massive expense, it's an embarrassment to the film makers that their classic has been brought to the DVD market with such disdain.

The music, and the sound of the little boy running through the cobble stone streets, and the stark contrast between the balloon's brilliant color and the boy's very grey world. I also remember the teachers at school telling us how they had to request this movie from the city library many months in advance because it was such a popular film with the school district. Who would have ever thought that American public schools could make such great decisions? Showing this film over and over year after year was one of the best ideas any of my teachers had. I really recommend you share this movie with your loved one's as it may just help create wonderful memories for them to look back on someday.",1042243200,5,1235,4.35064935064935

I didn't look far, since it appeared almost by magic on my Amazon start page this evening.... It was simple and charming and thought-provoking.  I am putting a copy in my shopping cart and am looking forward to sharing it with my four young sons as I strive to teach them to look with wonder on the everyday world.",1039651200,2,422,4.397435897435898

I am so thankful that I had such a lovely tale to help inform my bank of visual knowledge.

I remember being able to relate to this little boy who is lonely and trying to learn how to fit into the world. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie.
Many have debated the meaning and many more will. Many have discussed the theme and symbolism and many more will.
I will just say that to me this is about a little boy learning to survive, learning to fit in, learning about himself. This is about escaping the big mean world as well and learning to face reality.
Truly a charming movie that is well worth watching many times over.
Enjoy.",1029024000,,691,4.242424242424242
762745,4,6303968651,"The Red Balloon is a charming, childhood fantasy set in Paris, ""The City of Light.""  This short film is the story of a lonely little French boy who makes friends with a lonely red balloon. The balloon seems to have a mind of its own, waiting for the small boy, following him, and obeying his orders most of the time. The film makes its way with pretty much zero dialogue, and focuses on the lovely visuals. They used to show this film to us in elementary school, and I'll always remember the scene where the little boy encounters a little girl with a blue balloon, and the balloons want to follow each other as if they were a pair of dogs out on a walk with their owners. The story takes an ugly turn when a group of bullies decide to hunt down the little boy and destroy his balloon, simply because they have nothing better to do. But upon doing so, all the balloons in all of Paris come to the good little boy, to carry him off into the sky, and to who knows where...",1026086400,17,969,4.181818181818182

When I saw a portion of it late night on PBS some twenty years after having seen it in school I instantly recognized it and wanted it.
Not only did it win an academy award (not for short film or best foreign film but for Best Original Screenplay), the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival but also the Film of the Decade at the American Film Festival.
All this for a 30 minute film that has no dialogue - that has more emotional power than almost all films that I have seen.  It's the magic of childhood innocence.",1004400000,19,734,4.191489361702128
762748,1,6303968651,"... Nonetheless, for those of us who were born in the 60s, there's one factor, above all others, that forged our contempt : The Red Balloon.  We are the lost generation that had to sit through this godawful flick in some stinking grade school auditorium every time that it rained and we weren't allowed out on the playground for recess.
I don't recall, but I suppose the first time we saw it we may have even thought it was mildly cute.  It's fairly harmless--a little kid is followed all around some miserable, bombed out, French city by a vibrantly colored red balloon that he finds tied to a lamppost.  It eludes the grasp of others, but bobs and weaves all over the place so that the boy can tow it around.  After disrupting school and church it is finally hunted down by a gang of nearly feral French schoolchildren who stone it to death.  There follows the obligatory resurrection (the balloon having previously been immaculately conceived and crucified) as the boy is transported heavenwards by a host of balloons.  Hard to believe then how grating these 34 minutes of celluloid become by the end of the first viewing, never mind on the umpteenth.  We used to sit in the dark and pray that just this one time someone would burst the balloon in the first few minutes and save us from misery.  To no avail...",1001894400,23,1313,4.5574468085106385
762749,1,6303968651,"I heard about the film, and finally rented it, ready to love it. The Red Balloon is an empty suitcase. There's no movie here. Absolutely zero is happening on screen. I was expecting a sweet, lyrical allegory about childhood. Instead, I got 34 minutes of stultifying dullness, no humor, warmth, or pathos to be found. We learn very little about the character of the little boy: in fact, he has hardly any close-ups. We only see him walking down narrow, carbon copy streets. The balloon itself is equally banal. It never does anything, other than sticking close to the boy, and attempting to escape from enemies. If we had been granted an intimate look at the boy's home, school, or church life, perhaps this picture would actually have made some statement about growing up in the modern world, and enable us to identify with the child. Instead, it devolves in its last 10 minutes into a tepid chase film. Really, if you're looking for ruminations on childhood, you'd get more out of a typical ""Peanuts/Charley Brown"" cartoon, and if you want a ""boy and his special friend film"", rent E.T. If you need a silent film, where characters express emotions and social commentary is made without words, check out Charlie Chaplin's work. All too often, we Americans credit philosophical depth to foreign movies, when in reality those films are just mediocrities.",995587200,14,1352,4.857142857142857

The nasty children who chase the principal actor are a horror, but the film's ending is unforgettably magical.

It was about a little boy and a red balloon that escaped his grasp.  I was trying  to remember if the film had spoken words, and I thought that it did not.  I  was thinking about how it was such an unusual film, and how unusual it was  that I should remember it almost 30 years later.  I made a mental note to  some day find it.
Tonight, I sat here browsing Amazon, and I just fell  upon it.  The Red Balloon.  I must have it.  Funny, I can't remember if it  made me laugh or cry.  I just know that it is a memorable part of my  childhood, and if I have an opportunity to recapture some little memory of  a more simple time in my life, then I must seize that opportunity.

While at least one reviewer is ""haunted"" by the  behavior of the mean gang of boys (and I can understand why, they are  frightening) the film illustrates that though others may try to hurt us, we  can still find the courage to rise above it all and triumph.",929318400,6,626,4.353448275862069
