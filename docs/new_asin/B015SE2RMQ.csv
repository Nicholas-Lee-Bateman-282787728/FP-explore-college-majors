8734537,4,B015SE2RMQ,"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo documents the vanity and the bump of self-preservation what's fostered by the almighty casino. When M. Paul Gallard (Ronald Colman) of Paris cleans out the Baccarat bank in Monte Carlo and then elects to quit the gambling table without allowing the House a chance to win back its loot, oh, imagine the furor! It grows worse when M. Gallard's iron discipline to walk away is hullaballooed by the press. Such temerity is not to be tolerated, fumes the House director. Comes the all-out endeavor to tempt M. Gallard back to the fold, be it the show of good omen in the form of four-leaf clovers or the offer of the hotel's royal suite or the use of the matre d'hotel's personal yacht (ooooh, it boasts diesel engines and a ping pong table!). And yet M. Gallard refuses all.

M. Gallard has a sound reason for his serial rejection. Paul Gallard was once an aristocrat, a Russian expatriate - and what's a more Russian name than Paul Gallard? - who fled the revolution, and who for the past ten years has eked out a hardscrabble life as a humble cabbie. Gallard had amassed his gambling stake from fellow Parisian Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, all of whom had pinched pennies and saved and saved just for this one chance at fickle fortune. Now, having split his winnings - ten million francs! - with his compatriots, Gallard means to use his share to revive the posh old days.

And maybe he'll spend some on that enigmatic blonde (Joan Bennett) whom he seems to run into over and again, her and her shady brother (a very good, sneery Colin Clive).

The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, which reportedly has nothing to do with the popular 1891 music hall tune of the the same title, isn't one of Colman's more renowned films. In fact, it's eclipsed by many of his superior films. But that's just how terrific his other movies are. This one's watchable stuff, as well. Released in 1935 by 20th Century Fox, its genre can be categorized as a post-World War I romantic comedy and a sentimental tugging at that old Russian daydream of lost expatriate royals. The plot doesn't try too hard to fool you. You suspect what the deal is with Helen Berkeley, that enigmatic, playing-hard-to-get dame almost from jump. The script's snappy dialogue elicits a heap of chortles. The photography work casts cinematic glamour as embodied by our two exquisite-looking leads, who reunite six years after their marvelous 1929 colab, Bulldog Drummond. Joan Bennett is striking and serves her part adequately, but, not too surprisingly, it's the immaculate Ronald Colman who makes you want to see the movie thru. He's firmly cemented in history as one of the most urbane gentlemen in cinema, what with his patrician bearing and his honeyed way with elocution. But it's just as well that Colman isn't directed to project a Russian accent. I just can't imagine this gent without his dapper British airs. For fans of the 1940s Sherlock Holmes films, Nigel Bruce exhibits more sparkle here than as Dr. Watson and amuses as Gallard's inadvertently obstructive valet Ivan, an abiding source of frustration for his master. This isn't a must-see movie, but it's worth your time to watch it. For Ronald Colman.",1501459200,3,3222,4.7602862254025045
