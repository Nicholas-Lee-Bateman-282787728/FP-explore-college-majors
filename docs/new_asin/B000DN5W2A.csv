Thank You.",1226275200,2,192,5.586206896551724
8102707,5,B000DN5W2A,"This is a perfect ballet style story for a young child.  The characters dance and pantomime the story line while a narrator dubs in voices (I find the voices irritating at times, but my children don't mind at all).  The costumes are great, and the stories teach about kindness and being a good friend.  For little ones who are taking ballet lessons, it is a great opportunity to see how ballet can be used to tell a story.  I also appreciated that there are both male and female dancers.",1163894400,6,487,4.438202247191011
8102708,5,B000DN5W2A,"This series is a regular on PBS in NYC. Having moved to another state, I was extremely disappointed that it is not on our PBS cable channel. This is a wonderful, wonderful series that incorporates classical dance into lovely storylines. What I liked best was that the dancers are both female and male, thus appealing to boys and girls. It is filmed live on a set (no audience) and the music is classical. The sets are basic, but the characters use their imaginations and colorful props to play out a storyline. If I remember correctly, there is a narrator and the characters do not speak. My son watched this until age two. It was the only t.v. he was allowed to watch. I am so thrilled to find this on dvd as it is not played on PBS (to my knowledge) outside the New York metropolitan area.",1151280000,8,791,4.387755102040816
