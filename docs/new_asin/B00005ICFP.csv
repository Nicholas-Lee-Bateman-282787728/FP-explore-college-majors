7938371,3,B00005ICFP,"This is quite a useful introduction to the world of American Football (or Football as it's called in the States!) and to the Packers in general. It goes through the star players of the current squad in order, including There's Something About Mary star Brett Favre (who also turns up in South Park sharing a sauna with Mr Hat!) The positions are demonstrated and a few snatches of games are seen, however my one criticism is that it's a bit too short. 24 minutes for 12 people isn't that long. I would imagine the fans would prefer something more in depth too, perhaps with a little bit of the team's history and its unique standing as the only club in the NFL wholly owned by its supporters.",1004572800,,692,4.456692913385827
