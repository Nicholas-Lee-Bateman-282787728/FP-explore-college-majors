The characters are fun and If I would have to pick a favorite it would be Rob the Slasher and his chainsaw. Some of the gore effects are cheesy, some are really well done. It kinda reminds me of a GWAR style film. The movie is pretty damn funny and I hope they do more!",1351641600,,402,3.9753086419753085
8467065,5,B005DKS1VM,"I have been fortunate enough to watch more than a fair share of horror and cult films over the years, and many range in quality from being excellent and well-written to downright trashy and awful. It is true that sometimes such movies done on a low budget are unable to rise above that limitation in order to create a worthwhile story that is both fun and entertaining.  However, the same thing can equally be attributable to films with a much larger budget, largely because the millions of dollars provided by a hotshot studio are typically spent on special effects or the salaries of grade A Hollywood stars, which tend to consist of a lot of CGI nonsense while the stories themselves are neither groundbreaking nor original, and the BIG NAME actors that are recruited often give lackluster performances anyway. Tragically, this is often the case with certain films that are done within the HOLLYWOOD STUDIO SYSTEM. Even if a boring piece of crap is covered in diamonds and pearls...IT'S STILL A PIECE OF CRAP!

However, horror film history is rife with plenty of examples of classic horror/sci-fi/exploitation films done on a low budget independently that do manage to rise above budget restrictions and limitations in order to create truly memorable and entertaining films, and the reason for it is down to those involved BEHIND THE SCENES.  The cast and crew of many independent films that are often shown at film festivals and conventions are done out of love and a genuine passion for making movies.  Hell, the original Nightmare on Elm Street was a low budget film that NO major studio wanted to get behind.

I have met plenty of independent filmmakers that have made exceptional films because they all have a genuine love for the material and for the moviemaking process as AN ART FORM.  In many cases, those involved with these independent features love making them because of one thing and one thing only....  IT'S FUN!!

Which brings me to my review of this little independently made direct to video called 'Slashers Gone Wild'.

The film itself is actually a lot of fun to watch, because the film is jam-packed with plenty of pop culture humor (poking fun at talk shows, reality TV competitions, and pro-wrestling promos), which means that the film itself is actually a SATIRE of the Slasher movie genre.  The title itself, 'Slashers Gone Wild' is a pun on the popular 'Girls Gone Wild' franchise of videos (and this film even features a brief clip of a girl flashing her naked breasts in 'Girls Gone Wild' fashion, only to then be killed by poisoned beer).  Its obvious that this film isn't scary, but the point of the film isn't to be scary.  Its meant to be a social satire and social commentary, which is why the tone of the film is more tongue-in-cheek than being super serious.  If you approach the film with this in mind, you are bound to find much more enjoyment and entertainment value than if you are looking for a straight up 'serious' horror film.

This film is a pop culture & social satire/commentary about how the popularity of slasher villains like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers have elevated them to iconic status and thus making them idols of worship, and in some cases, heroes to horror movie fans everywhere.

In the film we are told about a corporate entity called 'Slashers, Inc.', which seems to be a shady, mysterious, multi-billion dollar corporation dedicated to cleaning up the environment 'by any means necessary' and have employed the use of psychotic killers to send the message out to people that pollution is bad.  The motto for the company is 'Recycle or Death'.

Before I continue, I just wish to point something out that some lesser informed reviewers seem ignorant about.  This movie was made over the course of TWO YEARS (notice how Raz, the guy playing Rob Thrasher, has a different hairstyle in every other shot?), which often involved the cast and crew getting together every OTHER weekend to shoot footage for the film because of other committments which often involved work or school, which didn't give them a lot of free time DURING THE WEEK.  The fact that they actually took their time making the film instead of it being a rushed job makes sense, because it gave them time to look over the footage they shot and allowed them the freedom to come up with new ideas for scenes to be added into the film as time went on as well as think about which scenes in the script could be shot and when.

The framing device of the film which involves a reporter doing a story about 'Slashers, Inc.', and investigating the website and the footage posted online.  If one were to actually think logically about this film, then your head might explode, which is why its best to not even bother and just enjoy the film and having a willing suspension of disbelief. QUIT BEING SO FREAKIN' PRETENTIOUS AND PENDANTIC, FOLKS!!

Anyway, the footage that is streamed from the website is a combination of various elements, which include faux commercials for 'Slashers, Inc.', for 'Thrill Kill Pills', and even talk show segments centered around the lead slasher for Slashers, Inc., Rob Thrasher, or elements involving a countrywide contest to find 'The Slasher of the Year', the winner would become the latest Slashers, Inc. employee and would receive a lifetime supply of Thrill Kill pills, and basically be made immortal.

if you break the film down, it really consists of a number of skits and scenarios, like seeing Rob Thrasher torture a girl by cutting off her leg at the knee or pulling her eyeball out, or even using a chainsaw to completely cut through a woman's head during his talk show segments.  Then there is the segment called 'Truth or Dare: The Game Show' by Slasher of the Year finalist 'Loonitic Rob'.  This segment is essentially a satire of the 'Saw' films, which involve Loonitic Rob and his co-horts 'The Murder Twins' kidnapping some unsuspecting morons, taking them into an unspecified location, and asking them questions that are impossible to answer, because its merely an excuse for Rob and his lovely assistants to engage in some gruesome torture and execution.  This section of the film is the most entertaining, largely because of the Loonitic Rob character, who is essentially what you would get if Charles Manson were a game show host, with the Murder Twins essentially being sexy, seductive and sociopathic equivalents of the Barker's Beauties.

You also get a segment involving an elderly gentleman called 'Nursery Rhyme Jack', which comes across like if Ed Gein replaced Fred Rogers as the host of 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'.  his voice and some of his vocal inflections even remind you of the late Fred Rogers as he gives the viewers a tour of his home, which involve a wide array of taxidermy.  There is even a very disturbing cooking show segment which involves Nursery Rhyme Jack cooking up the brains of a young girl he had just killed (Here's a fun fact: he actually used real dear brains that he purchased from a butcher shop in Ohio, plus the black and white ED GEIN CHRISTMAS video was based on a one-man play he used to perform live on stage, as stated in the audio commentary).

We then come to another entertaining segment of the film which centers around the character of Kevin Tooler.  Kevin Tooler's story is unique in that he was one of Rob Thrasher's victims, who was resurrected by ancient demonic forces and given command over a legion of demons that inhabit the bodies of the recently deceased.

the movie itself may not have a 'coherent' storyline and is made up of various bits and bobs thrown together, but in my opinion it works, because it is quite clear that the cast are having a blast.  And very often its their acting that elevates this film above its low budget limitations, because everyone delivers delightfully insane and over the top performances that are befitting their psychopathic and sociopathic characters.

The special effects are occasionally cheap looking, but still rather effective in a new age HG Lewis type of manner, which clearly illustrates the filmmakers' love for creative make up and gore effects done on the cheap.  Even the demons featured in the movie are clearly inspired by the demons featured in Lamberto Bava's 'Demons' and 'Demons 2'.

There is always something happening, which keeps things moving, and keeps things entertaining.  And that in the end is usually what we want from films, to be entertained.",1331942400,,8455,4.814226519337017
8467066,1,B005DKS1VM,"The potential was there for an enjoyable and fun low budget horror movie.  It's got chainsaws, masked villains, and plenty of stage blood.  However in the final analysis what we have is an incredibly amateurish video that would embarass not first-year, but first-day film students. Non-sensical and incoherent from the get go, it goes downhill from there being neither scary nor fun reducing even the most ardent believer in artistic license scratching their head.  Harsh, atrocious direct lighting, poor sound highlighted by most ""lines"" being out of sync with the ""actor"".  Shot on video and it shows.  Even first day film students entering the horror arena know that a video should have a point and take the viewer from point A to point B, etc.  Good T&A and kills can help soften the blow where budget and production value are deficient--part of the appeal for ultra-low budget horror.  At about the seven minute point it's easy to suspect that there is no script and the actors are merely ad-libbing lines.  No effort is made to make the video coherent or logical along a plot line, the product of a suspected $700 budget for the whole day of shooting it took to produce this turkey.  The actors, both villains and their victims, are neither likable nor skilled, better suited for a sidewalk mime show hoping to acquire an errant quarter from passers-by than placing their names in the credit section as cast in this video in the mistaken hopes of kudos for a job well done.",1331424000,4,1479,4.768627450980392
