8523685,3,B0080QOLBU,"While the under rated Rage in Harlem is the main reason to get this set, both the Glass Shield and In Too Deep are decent thriller with good casts and well acted. Malevolent can safely be given a miss",1398470400,,200,4.153846153846154

8523687,4,B0080QOLBU,"A Rage in Harlem and Malevolent were very entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Givens, Forrest Whitaker and the entire cast in a story that will hold you from beginning to end with a few laughs along the way.  Malevolent was also a good movie. The other two movies are not worth mentioning, but if you have some time to waste, then watch them.",1369440000,,348,4.507936507936508
