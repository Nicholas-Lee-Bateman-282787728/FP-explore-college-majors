2466148,4,B000CNE0RY,"I bought season 2 and 3 and I received them both yesterday. This DVD is great but I do have a couple complaints. The disks have 8 episodes on each disk and have 4 episodes on each side. I don't really like the whole side thing but it's not a big deal. Also while I was opening the DVD, I took a pair of scissors and cut off part of the wrapper on the side where you open the DVD and the scissors went in to the case and actually put a scratch on one of the disks. The DVD still plays well but it's a pretty thick scratch. Other than that this DVD is great",1437350400,,555,3.793103448275862

2466152,3,B000CNE0RY,Some episodes were funny. Of course this is 100% made up silliness. And that is how you have to watch it. Of course they really were not expected to do any work. It was part of the game. I liked the episodes where they were at the airport and plastic surgeon. The wedding planner one was kinda funny too. Funny. The others I can leave. And what is up with that pervert of a dad in DE? Eeeewww.,1422057600,,393,4.051282051282051

2466171,5,B000CNE0RY,"Nicole and Paris are funny and sweet in this show. I like how they try to help some of the families,ie. to stop smoking or buy a kid a bed. Also I love their fashion sense,they have different outfits for every job.",1388016000,,214,4.119047619047619
2466172,5,B000CNE0RY,"After buying - and loving - seasons one and two, I decided to take a chance and get season three. It is every bit as funny and engaging as its predecessors. The girls find themselves filling in as interns at various places, such as a nursing home, and working as airline attendants. This season is filmed as sort of a ""Candid Camera"" show: while the audience is in on the action, Paris and Nicole are as clueless as ever. Filled with humor, confusion, and good old-fashioned drama, TSL Season Three is a highly entertaining continuation of The Simple Life.",1386547200,,556,4.626262626262626
2466173,5,B000CNE0RY,"paris and nicole intern at various jobs and basically screw everything up lol, it's actually funny. well scripted and all but nontheless entertaining.",1385596800,,150,5.565217391304348
2466174,5,B000CNE0RY,This is probably my favorite season in the franchise. Paris and Nicole are amazingly hilarious and the jobs they are forced to do are even more so!,1370649600,,147,4.481481481481482
2466175,4,B000CNE0RY,"I love this show this show deserves 10 plus stars but the DVD is only 4 stars for a couple of reasons. #1 I didn't like how every time I finished 4 episodes I had to eject it and turn it over I would rather just have 8 on 2 discs or 4 discs with 8 episodes. Two In one of the pictures that was uploaded it had a sheet with the episode names and describing the episodes well I was expecting that when I got my package in the mail that day but when I opened it and it wasn't there so I don't know what the problem with that was but I would have really enjoyed it.
  There was some stuff I did enjoy on the dvd though. I liked that this season had 16 episodes when previous ones had 10. SO that was good. Also there were some good special features that I enjoyed can't wait to order the Simple Life 4.",1369353600,,798,3.83030303030303
2466176,5,B000CNE0RY,My best friend and I love Paris and Nicole. I would watch the show everyday if I could! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes to laugh!,1364774400,,152,4.275862068965517

2466178,5,B000CNE0RY,One of the funniest videos I have ever seen. A must have for anyone that likes a good laugh. Get all 5 seasons and enjoy. For being non professional woman Paris & Nicole are up there with the best of natural comidians. Buy without regret and enjoy.,1354838400,,248,4.297872340425532
2466179,5,B000CNE0RY,"I needed this final season to round out my Paris collection... Its like owning every ZsaZsa Gabor movie! I love Paris and its so cool to see this campy collection of hers! She has retreated from the lime-light, but we can remember her in her glory days! Big smoochies Paris! Loveit!",1350086400,,282,4.549019607843137
2466180,4,B000CNE0RY,Paris and Nicole are hilarious together. When nothing is on live tv I pop this dvd in and it always seems to put me in a better mood.,1345939200,,133,3.7857142857142856
2466181,5,B000CNE0RY,good everything i love the series i now have all five. DVD was perfect. hilarious favorite season so far out of all five. Thank you,1335398400,,131,4.28
2466182,4,B000CNE0RY,"As a social worker who works with disabled children I often lay awake at night worrying about their future. I Toss and turn thinking about how they will grow and become independent.

This groundbreaking TV series turned my fears into hope for a better tomorrow. Paris and Nicole (2 mentally challenged women) join the work force to gain independence while overcoming life's obstacles to prove that with enough support and perseverance that they can face any challenge headstrong and not let their illness get the best of them. It's a wonderful attitude to teach to any of the kids I work with.

I Only gave it 4 stars because in some of the episodes they fire the women which seems cruel, especially to someone in their situation.",1327968000,,730,4.74015748031496
2466183,5,B000CNE0RY,"I loved this series.  It's basically mindless fun to watch these two girls go on adventures.  Paris is the calm quiet one, while Nicole is the crazy one who always seems to get them into some kind of trouble.  It makes for a pretty hillarious show :)",1294876800,,250,4.276595744680851
2466184,3,B000CNE0RY,"'The Simple Life 3 - Interns' was made back when life was simple for Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. This was before all the coke and DUI busts the girls racked up individually and the eventual jail time they both served as a result of their numerous offenses. It was also the last season they appeared in together as best friends. Soon after 'Interns' aired,  Paris announced that she and Nicole were no longer friends nor were they even speaking to each other. So began a very public feud over very private reasons. Despite being contractually obligated to return for a fourth season, the two refused to appear onscreen together. They eventually worked things out and returned for a fifth season but by then they had already been dropped by Fox and viewership was down. Besides the increasingly annoying levels of diva like behavior and the girls' ridiculous sense of entitlement, I think another reason people stopped watching the show was because of how obviously fake it was. The first season you sort of went along with it and believed what you were watching, but after the show became a hit the producers obviously felt the need to go bigger for seasons 2 and 3. The episodes got to be so obviously scripted and acted that you began to wonder why the hell you were even watching it anymore. For me there's a simple explanation: these girls are super hot. Now a lot of people probably don't agree, but I think both of them are quite sexy and therefore found many of the situations they got themselves in in these 16 episodes highly entertaining.

Since this was the longest season you know there are going to be more than a few ""filler"" episodes that aren't all that great. Examples of this include internships with a fortune teller with attitude, an advertising agency no one's ever heard of including the people that work there, zookeepers, auto mechanics, wedding planners, bakers and a couple other ones I've already forgot about. Highlights include internships at a plastic surgeon's office, a dentist's office, a funeral home, an old folks' home, firefighters, marketing designers for Burger King, newscasters and daycare supervisors to name just a few. These specific episodes were a lot of fun to watch. Even though the situations are so outrageous and staged, the girls and their ""unwitting"" victims provide a lot of laughs. As a previous reviewer pointed out, Paris comes off really well this season. Whereas in previous seasons she could get quite annoying when it came time to get her hands dirty, she's more than game to jump right into her various internships and try new things. Plus, she proves herself to be quite good with kids (a thought that probably terrifies a lot of people) in several of the episodes, even going so far as to design a room for a boy who doesn't have a bed and sleeps on the floor in his sister's room and (in a precursor to her eventual BFF show) interviewing potential playmates for the adopted daughter of one of their host families. And it's not like Nicole doesn't do anything in these episodes, she's lightning quick at coming up with hilarious comebacks for bosses that try to put her and Paris down. As limited as their individual merits may be, what can I say other than they make a good team.",1286755200,6,3248,4.716549295774648
2466185,5,B000CNE0RY,"This Season of Paris and Nicole The Simple Life is so funny!!! If you like the Simple Life, this is the funniest one, because they take on an Internship! This is a really funny season! if your looking to buy this i recommend buying it here!! its cheaper, and it came fast!!

Thanks!",1260921600,,282,4.320754716981132
2466186,5,B000CNE0RY,"As much as I hate Paris and Nicole, it's like a guilty pleasure to see what trouble they will cause next. These shows are completely priceless and interesting. If you want to have a girls night in and watch something funny, try this dvd. Paris/Nicole fans or not, you'll be intrigued.",1211241600,,284,4.588235294117647
2466187,5,B000CNE0RY,"Probably tied at 1st with Season 2, the 3rd Season of the Simple Life brings huge laughs.  Even though it has the most episodes of any of the Seasons it still leaves you wanting more Paris and more Nichole in the end.  Unfortunately, Season 4 had to follow (for more on that read my review of Sn. 4)  This is one you'll be watching again and again.",1207612800,,348,4.164179104477612
2466188,5,B000CNE0RY,"These girls are just down right naughty  but yet funny, i loved all the shows and  i was kind of sad to see them go but life goes on.
Keep in mind these girls are not who we think they are ??",1200787200,,191,3.5238095238095237
2466189,5,B000CNE0RY,No matter how you feel about Paris or Nicole this show is hilarious. This season is one of my favorites and they are so funny. Loves it.,1184198400,,136,4.074074074074074
2466190,5,B000CNE0RY,"Hilarious show! I think the best season so far, but buy at TARGET for $5.50!",1174867200,,76,4.133333333333334
2466191,5,B000CNE0RY,They are at it again.  So much fun!  Worth every penny!,1173312000,,55,3.909090909090909
2466192,5,B000CNE0RY,"Great show, Paris is hot.

The funniest part was Paris doing the weather for FOX news in Baltimore.

It was so funny, and the bakery was good too.

The whole season was good.

GREAT.",1169251200,,182,4.264705882352941
2466193,5,B000CNE0RY,"There is no question about it, if you are a Simple Life fan, that this is the best season.  Nicole and Paris have buried their personal feud hatchet so hopefully season 5 will be as good as 3!",1163030400,,192,4.052631578947368
2466194,5,B000CNE0RY,"The first time I've seen passive agressive behavior that I approve! The deal is that when people are abusive to Nicole and Paris, they don't return the same abuse, not reducing themselves to stupid fighting, condescending comments, and other ways to make people feel bad about themselves. They take it in good stride - which would be a tough accomplishment for most Americans  . . .

Instead of returning insults like a ping pong volley, they find other, more constructive, ways to show their utter discomfort with some of these people, of whom can be described as Hateful, Jealous, Contentious, Mean-Spiritied, Ignorant, Abusive, Controlling, Unhappy, etc., ad finitum and nauseum.

Botom line - they have more moxy and more couth than their critics were expecting. I am duly impressed.

Both of them would make fine psychologists, if they felt the need to get the degrees necessary by working way too hard; don't ask me how I know about this . . .",1158969600,,949,4.839506172839506
2466195,4,B000CNE0RY,I DEFINETLY THINK SEASONS 1 & 2 ARE FUNNIER THEN SEASON 3..BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE STUPID MUNDANESS OF THESE 2 GRAB ME. THIS REMINDS ME OF STUFF I WOULD DO WHEN I WAS 19 AND A BIG PARTIER LOL,1158192000,,191,3.923076923076923
2466196,3,B000CNE0RY,"Paris and Nicole, you can't beat em.  But you can beat off to them!",1155427200,2,67,3.7857142857142856
2466197,5,B000CNE0RY,"i came to this w/o ever having seen anything with either girl in it and knowing only of their parentage. so i was pleasantly surprised. yes, the gals behave badly but it really is all in innocent fun. i didn't get the impression that they dissed anyone, and most of the people they met didn't seem offended. and it's actually pretty funny. i wouldn't buy this but it was worth the rental.",1154649600,2,388,4.402777777777778
2466198,1,B000CNE0RY,"If you think that two girly retards acting dumb and getting fired everyday is funny hit ""no"".

If you think that this sucks hit ""yes"".

Thus says The Metal Master 92...",1152489600,11,168,4.387096774193548
2466199,4,B000CNE0RY,"This season has some high points. The smoking couple, the monkeys, and Burger King. It is also kind of disgusting to see an anorexic (and less funny) Nicole run around on this episode. She is just not at her peak, and Paris complains and complains about DJ AM. Overall, though, its a good set to have, and funny to watch. Not one episode isn't funny.",1151971200,3,350,4.4
2466200,4,B000CNE0RY,I thought simple life 3 was pretty good.  That is if you like Paris Hilton and Nichole Richie *Which i do*  Otherwise i'm sure you would be utterly bored.  It was fun to watch the girls get into trouble and then trying to find ways to get out of it.  All in all i enjoyed watching the third season of Simple Life.,1151366400,,313,4.0
2466201,5,B000CNE0RY,"And I mean that.  These girls can make anything funny, and this season they take things up a notch and really let loose.  My favorite episode has to be when they are sent to sort mail and then by luch for everyone at the firm they are interning at and they screw everything up ROYALLY, eating everyones food, throwing mail in any bin and making faxes of their breast's and handing them out to the workers.  This show is the funniest thing on TV and now it's the funniest thing in my DVD case.  All the 4 & 5 star reviews are just added proof that Nicole & Paris serve up some of the biggest laughs in reality (or unreality) TV.  Worth every penny (it's cheap so pick it up!)",1148342400,6,674,4.153846153846154
2466202,4,B000CNE0RY,Of all the other seasons Id have to say this is the best!!! Especially because they are a lot more episodes where Paris actually tries to work and to help others not like any of the past seasons where she doesnt want to get dirty or she doesnt even try. This season has more comedy to it and Paris shows america that she is a nice intelligent person and that she is not just a 'dumb blonde.',1145491200,11,391,4.090909090909091
2466203,5,B000CNE0RY,"All I can say is that this show is very hilarious. Even any person who doesnt enjoy the comedy type of movies will really love it. I now have all 3 and they all ROCK!
 I gave my friend this dvd to see it over the weekend and I was just now with her on the phone and she said:""Did u see how they handled the kids?!). I said:""What kids?"" and she was like :""you've seen it c'mon"", and I kept on saying no i didn't, she said its on the opposite side of the disc. I was really shocked that i didn't turn the disc over. She's going to give it to me tomorrow at school, I don't know how i am going to survive waiting for 12-hours!!!!! No wonder why it finished so quickly, I've been missing half of it!!!! Can u imagine?!
  Nichole looks really cute this season, I wish they could get back together and film the simplelife 4!!
My friends and I keep saying sa sa sa sa, its so funny! LOVES IT! (SIL & GOLD)  LOL

 When I was in class, I laughed for several times and the teacher asked me: ""Why are you laughing?"". I answered :""Nothing, I just remembered something!"". She was like ""o.k..."". The thing I remembered was that when Paris and Nichole were working at a psychic place, their manager said ""foffesional"" instead of profesional. Paris was like ""what is foffesional?"" (lol) :)",1144540800,4,1273,4.2181069958847734
2466204,5,B000CNE0RY,I'm a very big fan of paris and nicole this is there last dvd when they were still friends. And this is the best season. I give it 10 stars..very good!,1143417600,8,151,3.903225806451613
2466205,4,B000CNE0RY,"I now own all three dvd's of the simple life.  I absolutely love this show.  I did think that the interns wasn't quite as funny as the previous two though.  something about it seemed more scripted.  don't get me wrong, it's still f-ing hilarious and i will probably watch it again tonight.  worth every penny, go get it!  they're baaaaack!!",1142812800,8,340,4.583333333333333
2466206,5,B000CNE0RY,"I just got the Simple Life 3 on DVD last night as a present. So far, i have watched 15 of the 16 episodes straight through. Paris and Nicole are SO funny! One of the only things i was disappointed with was that there were no special features. In the other Simple LIfe DVD's, they had things they cut out, bonus episodes, etc., and that is a feature missing in the 3rd installment. I really recommend this to anyone who has watched and liked the oher Simple Lifes, and to anyone who needs a good laugh.",1142640000,4,501,4.229166666666667

But of course we have ms Paris always looking in the mirror,And nicole cursing. But, that is what makes the simple life dvds sucessful. But, the hole feud going on between them is really dumb. I miss them being togeather. You can't do much about it,Nicole on the other hand I feel is The real star considering the areas of course, but she is just so funny and she makes me laugh every second. Now Paris on the other hand is funny as well but, Not as funny as Nicole. But I really love the girls a lot. Sa Sa sa sa sa sa!!!!!. lol. I love these girls.",1142553600,8,681,4.08955223880597

2466209,5,B000CNE0RY,"Back to their typical mischievous ways, the designer duo reak havoc as interns in this third installment of the popular FOX television series (which took over a year to be released on DVD).

The third season showcases a thinner Nicole Richie and a journey a la Greyhound Bus down the East Coast with everyday passengers and interesting characters along the way.

Owning the two previous seasons, I can definitely agree that the hijinks are never short of hilarious and the language is never short of ""do you love it?""

Whether they were attempting to change oil or diapers, photocopying/bubblewrapping their body parts, or giving the elderly a fashion show at a retirement home, the girls managed to get some above satisfactory reports from employers.

They also rekindled romance among members of the host families and used their hard earned money to give back.

The girls seldom take the jobs seriously, but that's what we love about them. They also possess an alluring charm that makes them human and an overpowering appeal that makes them simply irresistible.",1142380800,9,1063,5.017045454545454

2466211,5,B000CNE0RY,"I have both season one and season two on DVD! I have enjoyed watching both seasons many a time or two. Paris & Nicole's slapstick sense of humor make them a modern day Laurel and Hardy! Both season ONE and season TWO are HILARIOUS! I highly reccomend buying all THREE seasons. They are WELL WELL worth the money. I really enjoyed the interns season. I do think that the third season seemed alot more scripted than the past two; but it still had the magic, and spunk that drew me into both previous seasons. Don't miss out on this GREAT DVD! I have even turned friends of mine that did not like paris OR nicole into fans of the simple life!!!!

Nicole lost weight and is really looking good on the show. You won't go wrong in buying this DVD. Its funny, entertaining and worth the money.",1141516800,,317,4.213114754098361
2466213,5,B000CNE0RY,"This is the best season of the Simple Life! I loved it and i cant wait to get it on DVD when it comes out! I am so excited! I love the cover and all the episodes, espceially the bakery one, where the flour went everywhere!",1140825600,,222,3.847826086956522
2466214,4,B000CNE0RY,"For some bizzare reason, I would punish myself week after week by watching this.  It must have had some 'good' aspect to it in order to watch it every week, but looking back, I can't think of many.  I think I enjoyed watching these girls look like idiots the majority of the time.  They are beyond ditzy and without a doubt, most situations here were definate set ups.  One family they stayed with, the girls went with the sons to a gym and whilst the guys were showering, Paris and Nicole stole their clothes and the guys walked home with towels.  Now come on.  Like that wasn't a set up.  Spilling ashes from an urn at a funeral parlor and vacuuming it up?  Again - a set up.  Obviously you don't have to concentrate on this a lot; I think I just watched (and rated it 4 stars) for the laugh factor.  Not because they are funny, but because it makes a 5 year old look mature and smart.",1140480000,10,887,4.195266272189349
