2562951,5,B000FFL35Q,"To all those who are saying ""Oh, God! Viz butchered the Naruto dub! Dubs suck! I hate anime companies for ruining my favorite anime"" - get a grip. I have two words for you: One Piece. Remember what happened there? Exactly. The Naruto dub could have been a lot - and I mean A LOT - worse than it is. It is actually very good. The voices fit the characters and the script hasn't been drastically butchered a la the style of 4Kids. So for the love of God, stop complaining and deal with it.",1150675200,7,487,4.136842105263158
2562952,5,B000FFL35Q,"Wait 5 months.  The price will drop to $15.  No one will buy it because Naruto is downloaded so much (probably the #1 or #2 most downloaded anime; Bleach might currently outrank because of the year of fillers).  It happened to the first DVD (you can find it for about $5 at Suncoast.

Anyways, great anime.  The ""sexy no jutsu"" scenes might be a little much, but honestly its nothing worse then the dresses at American award ceremonies and 100x more ""family suitable"" then some scene in Titanic, the Fifth Element, etc...especially since the point of the scene is not to show pr0n, but to insult the perverted nature of people who do watch pr0n, or it is implied that they do.

Oh, and despite what I read on a forum: the clouds in the sexy no jutsu and harem no jutsu scenes are in the uncut version too.  They are not CN edits.",1148515200,10,829,4.3441558441558445
2562953,5,B000FFL35Q,"I can't wait for the season box set come out on the 4th of July. Naruto was always the kid who had no friends cause he's half human half demon fox cause a 9 tail fox demon was sealed inside Naruto when he was just a baby. When he gets mad his true power unlease.

Even when you watch this show on Toonami it's not so bad cause they show some blood, risque humor, and brief nudity. Just image how the uncut dvd will be like.",1147046400,6,423,3.9186046511627906

2562968,5,B000FFL35Q,"I love Naruto. Especially once Shippuden gets rolling. When I was in my teens I first saw a few episodes of Naruto back when it started, 2006ish and I hated it. Thought it was for little kids and I didn't give it more than 5 minutes. I was around 17 or 18... now, not even a decade later (currently 26) I've already seen them all caught up with Shippuden and started them all over again. Watch a few episodes, like any show there are a few parts where you will think this is for little kids but let it get past that and you'll start liking it. Keep in mind this does go through progression. Earlier seasons are more kiddish because Naruto is younger and he matures throughout the series. You really see the progression in Shippuden.",1428537600,,732,4.350364963503649

2562992,3,B000FFL35Q,"Naruto was one of my first introductions to anime, and I have to recommend it as a classic.  But . . . it's also disturbing akin to American soap operas in that a seemingly endless series of episodes are devoted to a single crisis or storyline with only glacial movement to resolving the crisis.  Of course this leads to ""seasonal renewal"" so it's a commercial necessity,  but it takes a really, REALLY long time to move from one story line to the next.  Still, Naruto and his friends are well-developed characters, and they're almost all memorable.",1426550400,,549,4.6875

2563061,1,B000FFL35Q,"I am desperately trying to give this show a chance. I am on episode 22 and already I can't stand the main protagonist. Whats worst is that I know that this character is protected against being killed due to the fact that the show is in his name, and their wouldn't be a show if he parishes. The repeated words ""Believe it"" is starting to irritate me on top it off, and the fact that this character keeps screaming for no reason. The second supporting character, Sakura, reminds me of a female dog in heat. She can't stop pestering the third supporting character, Sasuke. Instead of using her energy and time on her ninja training, and actually be useful to the group when the time comes to fighting opponents, she spends it all on trying to get a date with Sasuke, which he shows no interests in her. She keeps pushing and pushing. The only character that I find acceptable as a main protagonist is Sasuke, but he isn't. IMO I think the show would be a lot better if it was primary focused on Sasuke, and not Naruto.",1417132800,,1016,4.380952380952381

The story is good, SPOILER ALERT, it all began with a child that is used to keep the spirit of a really bad demon, and his trip through life while everybody don't like him because of the demon.  This first season is good till they get to a mission which actually take more than five chapters, and it turns slow, but finish showing the relationship of Naruto with his teammates.  One bad-point about the production is that it takes like 3 1/2 minutes in the intro including a recap then the exit song, about 1 1/2 min leaving ~19 min of action.",1415059200,,764,4.219178082191781

My children are still young but of age to start understanding the complex relationships the beautifully orchestrated characters portray. The concepts of adoration, admiration, and love. The want to protect ones friends and family and community that become your extended circle. The lessons of acceptance of each others differences, forgiveness of acts and personas of evil as they change to good, and defiance of overwhelming odds. An extremely well written engaging adventure. I do not even mind the soap opera drama, I mean character development that takes place in between the action. But of course my favorite are the multi-episode drawn out fight sequences.

2563310,5,B000FFL35Q,"I knew It'd be dope - because Shippuuden just looked so epic. I also knew I was in for ALOT of watching - so I say hell yeah to VIZ for putting it up for Prime Members on Instant - makes the show much more accessible to me. I will watch all of naruto while its prime instant - then buy up all the 6 Naruto Shipuudeen seasons (err 5 thus far? or something like that). I was actually expecting, if this makes sense - DragonBall : DragonBall Z (latter series being more fight/epic/bloody/intense! and former series being more adventure turning into more epic fighting with the world martial arts tournments -  I figured (as they all get equated DB-DBZ, Naruto, HunterxHunter, Yu Yu Hakusho and Inuyasha - which I can't watch the final act - because the antagonists/background music lost all its creepy asthetics, the main antagonist (its been awhile since I watched naruto) had suuuch a freakin' creepy voice - infact thats what drew me to the series even though it seemed like a shounen/shoujo hybrid with the rom-com element way over the top at points and lots of filler - I couldn't wait to see the ending, now Im disinterested. VA and background musice changes - changed the whole aesthetic, mystical, creepy feel and Inuyasha just isn't the same without Richard Ian Cox although his voice as Inuyasha I won't lie took some getting used to; was a bit annoying at first - but enough late night insomnia on cartoon networks anime night with nothing else to watch got me hooked) I figured it would be the same with Naruto to Naruto Shippuuden - but Naruto is pretty damned epic right from the start - especially when you first meet Kekaishi Sensei and (where Im at right now) the end - ish of the Chunin exams. I know now that I was wrong - Naruto is badass action - basically once they get past the training/character development, I do wish there was less filler (haha NOT NEARLY Snake Way level of filler but still) - the episodes with the Hokage son seem like filler to me, I just want non-stop action in a show like this, I enjoy how the Upped the insensity of their powers quickly and seem to only be growing. Im fascinated to see the full extent of their powers (Souske, Naruto and Sakura - hopeing she become equi-powerful and not the damsel in distress all the time ala  Orihime in Bleach.)

I also dig the old school aesthetics to the animation - didn't realize it was quite as old as it was (reminds me more of hunterxhunter animation wise - than say dragon ball z - speaking of which when the hell is the Reboot of HunterXHunter getting dubbed?! I'm eagerly anticipating that - esp with new arcs. I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z and as a teen got into Bleach - which then reignited my love for all Shounen anime (esp. ones with more of a Seinen edge to them haha) and all anime in general (esp super surreal ones like Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost Hound, Black Lagoon, Elfen Lied, Bologie Pop Phantom (still don't get it - but I love it haha), and more recently Ive really been diggin Nura; Rise of The Yokai Clan - its like the best of shounen - without copycatting, in an occult cryptohistographical account of 20th century Japan. Demon Capital Set 1-2 is where its at but the original season 1 and 2 are dope. I'm actually on Season 3 of Naruto right now - but I must say, without people putting up long running series (that would cost boat loads to buy, plus if I were to collect Naruto Id wait for blu-ray season sets personally, I hate set 1/set 2 type deals. Gimme a whole season to binge lmao - or ill just wait til the 2nd party one comes out (or comes in the mail). I can see alot of past influences on Naruto aswell as shows Naruto has inspired (be it for good or bad). Reminds me more of HunterxHunter or Yu Yu Hakushow (or Dragon Ball if were talking the end of the series) in terms of animation and theres lots (seemingly endless at this point) of exams/fights/tournaments. I cant wait till their out of school - and kickin' butt with insane powers haha. I had been avoiding it because 8 seasons is alot to collect and im already getting the new DBZ blurays (look great, screw the haters) and One Peice set by set, (one of the many) good thing(s) about amazon prime is if you preorder like months in advance you can knock like almost half the price off (and free shipping) because you're preordering it, if it works the same way as it does in the music industry - pre orders are taken so they can manufacture the discs (might work different in visual medium/big name companies) and to help promote the product (thus the special box sets with extra stuff - although I think they could up there game majorly there, if your gonna toute extras - have something other than the opening/ending we've seen a billion times with no text, and 1 commentary track please. Something with video - with the actors, panel or something at a convention, talking to fans, employees, behind the scenes, interviews, in the studio with the ADR director, engineer and VA, archival stuff (like the DBZ blurays), etc - or like the Beserk III: The Advent BluRay - the Outtakes we're HILARIOUS! Closest thing to an anime MST3K I've ever seen...now thats genius stuff and im sure theres plenty of outtakes that are funny as hell from almost any session with a seasoned team (VA, ADR Director, Engineer) who work well. Its a shame to just delete such gold - you should put as many extras on until the damned blurays/dvds are FULL. Its not like it would take much or any capital - you've gotta have a camera somewhere LOL and plenty of recording equiptment, and it would boost sales of physical copies veruses digital in a time where digital is taking over (good and bad, once digital is the only way - you really should include the extras with a season set bought digitally aswell).

Also - Nocando of Flash Bang Grenada w/ Busdriver (HellFyre Club) mentions Naruto quite a few times but one that stuck out in my head ""...now its a blessing/ if haters were dollars I could pull the country out of recession/but f*** it - I'd rather get power out of progression for my Ninjas like Naruto; Not for you Putos"" - 10 Haters. Dunno why but Ive been listening to that album alot (I do know that - because its one of the best albums released in a looong time and my favorite from busdriver I think in his whole catalog due to its sheer intelligence and over the top (almost surrealistic) mocking of the rap genre's overused tropes - whilst being two of the illest emcess to ever touch the microphone - busdrivers flow is incredible ""Over the weekend I got a degree in Reiki Healing and I minored and poly sci."" Now say that 4x faster than you think it would ever be spit, it just rolls of the tongue constructed perfectly - anyway back to naruto) and that lyric got stuck in my head the same day I noticed all of Naruto was put on prime, so it it was a done deal - I knew Id watch it eventually - but it seemed like alot to tackle at once without having a bulk of the episodes available to watch (lots of cliffhangers - and I hate those, thus why I binge watch seasons LOL). Anyway great show, 5 stars - not what I was expecting at all (more kiddish is what I was expecting but I got an action packed cool ass shounen series instead; that I expect only to get more brutal and intense in shippuudeen (I mean the latest movie was called BLOOD PRISON - that intrigued me to hell and back - I was like how the hell did naruto get into a concentration death camp?! Another reason to watch all the series so I can watch that EPIC looking movie haha).",1402617600,,7531,4.388690050107373

Literately the episode begins with the closing credits to the last one.. I dunno why this has happened not a huge inconvience but it is annoying. the intro last almost 5 minutes now but you can just skip ahead. Besides the ""believe it"" he says OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

2563359,5,B000FFL35Q,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW INCLUDES MOSTLY INFO ABOUT THE 1ST EPISODE AND SOME OF THE 1ST ISSUE OF THE MANGA

Naruto is about a young boy named Naruto Uzumaki who has a tailed beast sealed inside him called the Nine Tails. In the 1st issue which is where it all begins it starts with a flashback to the the Nine tails attack on the village 12 years ago. You see a man who is standing on a giant toad which name will be revealed later on. He seals the monster inside a baby with his sealing jutsu. Jutsu is a skill that varies in three types. Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and Taijutsu but the only important jutsu in this issue is shadow clone jutsu which will contain clones of you that can help out. But off that topic and returning to the subject of that man he dies and it turns out the baby he sealed the monster in is Naruto and that man was the Fourth Hokage. A Hokage is the leader of The hidden leaf village or hidden leaf. Anyway off the topic of the past it starts with Naruto running around the village causing trouble and painting on the Hokage's faces which are carved into a mountain.  He does not know he actually has a monster in him for the moment and everyone rejects him for it and the sad part is he doesn't not even know. He is the class clown and the troublemaker of The Hidden Leaf Village and nobody likes him and the closest thing he has to a friend is Iruka Umino his sensei and teacher at the Ninja Academy which is basically School. Naruto has no parents and lives in a small apartment . He is very lonely and can relate to Iruka sensei because his parents died in the attack. Naruto's favorite food is ramen and that is how Iruka got him to clean his mess up on the mountainside faces. Naruto needs to graduate his ninja academy this year so he can finally move up so he works hard. However evil is always there and in this issue it was kinda like a side teacher to Iruka named Mizuki. To pass this year Iruka tells students at the day of the exam and calls them up one by one. This year you had to make 3 clones and Naruto could not even make one good one so he failed. Later on when Naruto was alone once again and while everybody was being congratulated by their parents Mizuki told Naruto to take secret scrolls and learn a new Jutsu so he could pass. It turned into a real emergency but even though Naruto was being deceived he learned one of his most used Justus ever called Shadow Clone Jutsu. Eventually the battle between Naruto and Iruka vs Mizuki broke out. It was very emotional and it was filled with a lot of deepness in the fight. Mizuki even told Naruto how he has the beast inside him that attacked the village which was forbidden. Later Naruto used his newly developed jutsu to beat Mizuki and graduate from the academy and things will only get better on from here.",1353974400,,2796,4.234082397003745
2563360,5,B000FFL35Q,I am a huge fan of the Naruto series and these episodes bring back my memories of how awesome this series is. I would recommend this to any person who wants to get into Naruto.,1353801600,,176,4.057142857142857

2563373,3,B000FFL35Q,"As I commented to someone who said they didn't understand the series after watching the first couple episodes, the first half of Naruto is really just to setup the environment for the real story. It places you in a world of Ninjas, some people even make careers out of it. Young kids and teens in this universe strive to become the best ninjas they can. They also live through normal teen events, like crushes and making and losing friends.

But then the REAL story starts to unfold, and the plot thickens. We learn about dirty politics, secrets pasts, and a darker history. There are lost of subplots as well, filling up an already large story universe. All the while, our young protagonists have to live and fight through it all.

It's been awhile since these earlier volumes have been released. I highly recommend buying these used for a cheaper price. The DVDs simply are not worth paying full price for. Mainly due to the fact you can easily watch these episodes online for free (or in some cases, even download for free.) There are numerous Naruto fan sites online that have the episodes, both subbed and dubbed archived.",1250208000,,1127,4.686868686868687

2563376,1,B000FFL35Q,"This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series.  Now that's saying a lot.

Ok now on to some of the things that made it so bad.  First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago.  Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place.  Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura,  and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas.  Which wouldn't have been so bad had the creators focused  on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action.  Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary.  Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters.  I'll focus on Naruto.  He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series.  Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show.  The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke.  Ok moving on to the so called action.  First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes.  Finally there's the length of the so called series.  There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs.  I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money.

2563380,4,B000FFL35Q,"Naruto is one of my favorite anime series to come down the pike in quite a while, and my favorite period shonen series.  The characters are very engaging, and the fights as spectacular as Dragonball Z's, with the added benefit that Naruto doesn't try to stretch a manga panel out to 22 minutes.

This set features young Naruto Uzumaki's first steps to become a full-fledged ninja of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.  Now, being a ninja would be fine for the likes of you and I, but Naruto wants to become the equivalent of the village's ninja president - the Hokage.  Thanks to the circumstances of his birth, Naruto's been shunned by the entire village with friends or even parents.  He thinks if he can become Hokage, then everyone will finally have to acknowledge his existence and respect him.  More than that, though, Naruto simply wants friends.  This set lets us meet his first few, his teachers Iruka and Kakashi, and squad-mates Sakura and Sasuke.  Also we meet his first great threat - the Demon of the Mist Zabuza.

As for the DVDs themselves, it's fairly bare-bones, though it does come with a small booklet of one of the episodes in storyboard format.  The voice acting in both Japanese and English is excellent, so you don't need to worry about picking one or the other.  If you want a new fighting anime with fun characters, cool battles and oddly touching moments, Naruto's your new jam.

2563384,5,B000FFL35Q,"First of all, let me first establish the fact that this anime is based on a shounen manga...which translates to:

THIS IS A KID'S ANIME.

That's right. Shounen anime/manga is a means of entertainment that targets young boys ranging from elementary school age to 18 years of age. Yes, that's on the same level as Pokmon if that's what you're thinking. Anyway, having said that, if you are expecting a ""Ghost in the Shell/Ninja Srcoll/Basalisk""-esque plot then prepare to be disappointed. Again, it's a kid's anime-- chalk full of over-the-top antics, slightly perverted humor, and lots of blatant ninja clichs.

I don't mind any of that stuff. I love this anime and tons of others (and this is coming from a young woman who put's Darwin's 'Origin of Species' pretty high up there on her good reads list). Simple things can be quite enjoyable if given a chance. I think that Naruto should be given a chance. If you'd rather test it out before purchasing however, simply reserve 30-minutes of your time to Cartoon Network and check out an episode. Easy, yes?",1216684800,2,1055,4.785714285714286
2563385,1,B000FFL35Q,"I have watched many episodes of Naruto and I must say that this is not worth paying 45 bucks for! The storyline is weak and full of cliches and super boring! All the characters do is walk around, throw ninja stars, and crack some retarded jokes. If your into cliche joke busting ninjas then you will love this, might I suggest Bleach, xxxHOLiC, Ultra Maniac, or any Hayao Miyazaki films. Thank you for your time! :D",1214870400,,415,4.473684210526316
2563386,3,B000FFL35Q,"This is a three-disc set that contains the first thirteen episodes of Naruto and a few extras.  This set includes both the Japanese and English language tracks (and English subtitles for the Japanese language track).

The extras aren't overly impressive.  There's eight pages of ""Production Art"" (model sketches of some of the Naruto characters).  There's a feature labeled as, ""From Sketch to Screen Episode 1""; this includes eight pages of storyboards, and for each storyboard, you can see the clip that the storyboard is for.  The English credits are included as an extra, but there's no background music, so this is a rather uninteresting thing to view.

There is a sneak preview of the second Naruto box set, but this preview feels more like an extended preview for the first episode of disc two.  There's also plenty of advertising included as extras: trailers for One Piece and Hikaru no go, advertisements for various Shonen Jump mangas, as well as an ad for Shonen Jump Magazine.

I was definitely disappointed in the special features.  After watching this set, I was left with the impression that Viz was trying to produce the set as cheaply as possible.  It's almost as if the thinking was that the Naruto property is so popular that the fans will buy the set, no matter how many or how few extras are included on it.

Also allowing to watch the show with the Japanese voice cast, which in my opinion are much more talented than the English voices.  Really just Naruto's voice is the downer in the English version, but that's no reason to discard this great series!",1199664000,,516,4.764044943820225
2563391,5,B000FFL35Q,"I avoided watching Naruto for so long... Simply because I wasn't a fan of the character designs and because the story seemed shallow. It was by chance I saw an episode on Cartoon Network and had my oppinion swayed. 3 episodes later and my original oppinion was spun in the completely opposite direction. The show was good. But not until I brought the uncut DVD's that I realised the show is more than good... It's bloody great!

Though at first I thought the show was good dumb fun I was soon to find out this anime can be surprisingly deep and touching. It has even provoked tears at times. The character designs also grew on me... pushed along by the enthralling personalities of the characters. And the voice acting... Both the original and the english dub... is fantastic.

Naruto is an anime I'd reccommend to anyone that likes anime or action. It seems to have it all. A little something to appeal to everyone.

Though I must say... Naruto Volume One is the weakest of all the box sets released thus far (5 as of writing). It starts off slow and silly and doesn't get too interesting until the first major villian (Zabuza) comes along. But once Zabuza hits, the show rockets into first gear and shows why it is the best shonen title currently on the market.",1199318400,5,1263,4.530701754385965
2563412,2,B000FFL35Q,"Let me clear this up right now before I even start this review: The Naruto series has many strengths. The characters in it are interesting and unique and the general storyline is great. Furthermore the animation and voicing are stupendous and make the show worth watching.

If I was rating based solely on the the TV series, Naruto would easily get 5 stars; but I'm not. I'm rating the box set as a whole, and honestly it is severely lacking. First of all the set only comes with 3 discs (12 episodes total). For around 50 dollars this is an enormous rip-off. Other series I have purchased recently (DBZ, Lost, Heroes, etc) come with 6-8 discs and over 20 episodes (most of them hour-long episodes) for around the same price if not a little cheaper! Plus each episode is less than half an hour long; that is just a horrible deal right there. Another thing that detracts from the Naruto sets is that it holds back on special features. If you are a fan like me, you love to poke around all the extra tid-bits usually crammed in similar box sets (ie making of, deleted scenes, interviews, etc)!

Finally, the box sets never end on a complete note; they all awkwardly leave off right in the middle of a story. To make this even more excrutiating, the majority of the run time of these discs is taken up by the theme song at the begginning and end and the episode recap. A lot of the animation is just recycled over and over again to eat away the time and plot development.

I give the this product 2 stars only because Naruto itself is a great anime show. Unfortunately the Boxed Sets leave a lot to be desired.",1198886400,15,1607,4.404040404040404

2563414,4,B000FFL35Q,"The series is great, but it should be known that you can get all the Naruto Uncut boxed sets at Wal-Mart for almost half the price they're offering at Amazon.

2563415,5,B000FFL35Q,"Most reviews don't seem to actually describe the show, assuming you've already seen it and simply are thinking about the DVDs.  I'll see what I can do to describe the show and why it's so appealing:

The character of Naruto is a young ninja-in-training.  His village once fought a terrible beast, the ""Nine-Tailed Fox"", and the only way to defeat it was to trap its soul in the body of an infant.  That infant was Naruto.

His parents died in the battle and years later, Naruto finds himself a complete outcast from society.  No family, no friends, and a village that doesn't seem to know he exists.  He doesn't know the Nine-Tailed fox is imprisoned in him but the villagers all know and they shun him for the fear it causes them.

Naruto decides that the only way he's going to get the recognition he craves is to become the greatest ninja ever known.

Unfortunately for Naruto, his ninja skills are a bit, well, lacking.  He is woefully inept at even the most basic ninja skills.  Powers easily grasped by other trainees are difficult for him.

However, Naruto has several powerful strengths:
1) He has nearly unlimited energy.  All ninjas use ""chakra"" (sort of like ""spirit energy"") to do special moves and Naruto seems to have more of it than anyone, thanks to the hidden power of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
2) He never gives up.  Long past the point where anyone else would have quit, Naruto will keep trying.
3) Having grown up largely without family or friends, he takes great stock in his newfound campanions picked up in ninja school.  Naruto is at his most powerful when his friends are in danger, and the full power of the Nine-Tailed Fox tends to manifest at that point.
4) Naruto has great charisma, of a type.  His never-say-never attitude is highly infectious amongst other characters.  A key turning point of many of the tales is not only how his hope never turns to despair, but that seeing this, many good people who were struck with despair manage to rally and try harder.  If this loser Naruto hasn't given up, they reason, then there's no reason I should give up either.  So he wields great power himself at times, but he also consistantly drives other people to work harder and to do the right thing, since none of them want to measure up short to this ""hyperactive knucklehead"".
5) Naruto is good at heart.  One of the tales you'll get into later is Naruto vs Gaara.  Gaara's character faced a situation growing up similar to Naruto, but he turned out evil, corrupt and thought that self-reliance was the most important thing.  Naruto kept an essential goodness in his heart and knew that goodness was essential and a person's real strength is in his friends and family, no matter how despairing the circumstances seem to be.

All in all, it's a great tale.

Is it good for kids?  I say so.  Target audience is probably the 12+ range or so.  Some of the images and concepts are disturbing, but everything in this show is a means to an end, and the most terrible scenes are a setup for a particular act of courage or moral goodness that counters it.  You can find plenty of kid friendly shows out there, but their moral lessons tend to be fluff.  Naruto is harder hitting, but the moral lessons are solid, core lessons.  This isn't, ""it's wrong to steal"" or ""sharing is caring"", this is, ""when things are at their darkest, redouble your efforts and keep trying"" and ""the decision between right and wrong is in your hands, and there is no proper excuse for doing wrong"".  It's a show with great heart, and I think you'd do well to watch it with your kids rather than simply pre-screening it.  Keep an open mind about some of the situations it puts the characters in and wait for the lesson it delivers and I think you'll be well pleased.

As for the DVD set itself, I have two small complaints: the subtitles sometimes go by unnecessarily fast and the extra features are kinda...weak.  I actually really like the English voice work, which I thought they did a really good job on, but I thought it would be interesting to hear the original voices so I've been rewatching it in Japanese with English subtitles.  In places, the subtitles will literally only give you 2 seconds for quite a large blurb of text.  I read fast but there are places where I have to rewind it because I didn't get a chance to read it all.  And it's a shame the extra features don't have an interview with someone.  Director?  Writer?  Artist?  Voice actor?  I'm not picky.  I always love to see a ""behind the scenes chat"" with someone involved with a show and something like that would have been a real nice thing to have.",1196294400,57,4612,4.532687651331719

It makes for a nice purchase for anyone be it an avid Naruto fan or someone slightly on the fence about it.,1195689600,,548,4.281553398058253
2563417,5,B000FFL35Q,"First off I'll start off by saying I watch A LOT of anime. Secondly Naruto happened to be the anime that got me hooked on all Anime. That being said I would like to say Naruto remains my favorite. I also want to say I am female which I think is important because it can appeal to both genders, because when you watch it, it really doesn't matter because the plot it just amazing! The show never seizes to surprise me one arc after another,it gets better and better. It doesn't matter if you like dub or sub just buy it and watch it! (I happen to prefer the sub, I fell in love with the Japanese voice actors) But I've practically watched them all on Cartoon Network too and the dub isn't horrible, in fact I'd say it is one of the best.
It has it all action, drama, adventure, and humor. But I would agree with another reviewer it does get darker as it goes on which makes it better, in my opinion. But probably not suitable for younger children. But it makes a killer story for the rest of us!
That's why I rated it five stars because it remains my favorite after all these years (yes, sadly years) and in my mind no Anime will surpass it!",1191715200,3,1140,4.16289592760181

The box has a fold open case with the three discs in it, plus a Storyboard for episode 8(A book with the cartoonists drawings and notes-they're in japanese though, so if you're like me, you can't read what the artist said).  The fold open case for the discs has great graphics on it, I love the pictures on it.  You can watch in english or japanese, and it has the option for english subtitles.  The special features are all on disc 3.  I checked them out, and the only part I really enjoyed from the special features was the sneak peek of the next boxed set.  There are 13 episodes in the first box.

DISC 1
1. Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
2. My Name is Konohamaru
3. Sasuke and Sakura:  Friends or Foes?
4. Pass or Fail:  Survival Test
5. You Failed!  Kakashi's Final Decision.

6. A Dangerous Mission!  Journey to the Land of Waves!
7. The Assassin of the Mist
8. The Oath of Pain
9. Kakashi:  Sharingan Warrior!
DISC 3
10. The Forest of Chakra
11. The Land Where a Hero ONce Lived
12. Battle on the Bridge!  Zabuza Returns!
13. Haku's Secret Jutsu:  Crystal Ice Mirrors

P.S. If you have never seen this before, buy the second box when you buy the first if you can, because it ends with you going, ""WHERE'S THE NEXT EPISODEEEE!!!!!""  Seriously.  You won't want to wait for it.

Also, there are over 250 episodes of Naruto so far, (The U.S. has only aired 103 so far-sad face-as of Sept. 9, 2007) so there are going to be tons of boxed sets.  I've been catching them on sale.  I suggest you try to do the same.  Though I had to go ahead and buy four and pre-order box 5, because I just can't wait.",1189296000,3,1677,4.237341772151899

This series has one of the best stories and some of the most interested characters you'll find in a Japanese anime. Kishi, the creator, creates many ways to confuse you and make you think about the events going on throughtout the story. Most fans love the mind games and he really keeps you guessing. I reccomend this to anybody who loves Ninja's, DBZ, and Japanese myths. This is the anime for you.",1188432000,,484,4.511363636363637
2563420,5,B000FFL35Q,"I highly recommend this anime. It has good animation and story line, great action and funny parts, and best of all, THE GREATEST SOUNDTRACK EVER!! I was blown away by how awesome the music is. Whether the scene is sad, funny, romantic, or action-packed, the background music always puts you right in the moment. I strongly urge you to buy the boxed sets and not the individual discs because the sets are so much better. It shows alot more blood and action that the network found to be too graphic for young kids. The blood isn't excessive, it just makes it more realistic.
  As for the boxed set itself, the shiny cover is really cool, the inside case has some neat artwork, and it comes with an original storyboard booklet of episode 8. It's pretty much a little manga book. The special features are good too, with a very tempting preview of the second boxed set.
  The only bad part about the series is that sometimes they analyse their moves too much or talk too much during a battle when you wish they would just hurry up and fight. Also, Naruto's main slogan ""Believe It!"" gets old really fast.
  But these down-sides are very small when you look at the big picture and if you don't like the series that much, give it a second chance because it gets so much better as the series progresses. Again, I strongly recommend this series as one of the 5 best animes of all time, but be sure to buy the boxed sets because, compared to the edited single disks, they're so much better. And make sure to get the DVD's from Amazon.com because I don't think you'll find a better price anywhere else.
  The series is entertaining for all ages but because of blood, violence, and some toilet humor, I recommend this particular boxed set for ages 10+. For younger kids, get the edited single disk editions.",1187654400,,1795,4.501538461538462

2563432,5,B000FFL35Q,"Be forewarned: although the first few seasons are relatively innocent and fun this series gets very dark, violent and emotionally troubling starting around season 4. If you don't want to have to explain to your kids why they can't watch their favorite show anymore then you might want to think twice about starting them off with this series.

At the same time, the same deep and mature themes that make this series inappropriate for children make it engaging for adults! Naruto is character-driven with deep themes and complex narrative structures that really only start to emerge around the third season. I highly recommend it...for ADULTS, that is!",1181088000,5,650,5.074766355140187

What I loved most about it was that it wasn't as conservative as the show on T.V. A bit more blood doesn't hurt anyone (err...except for the person with the wound) and I actually UNDERSTOOD the scene with Naruto and Sasuke in Episode 3. In the T.V. version, I had to rewatch the scene because I didn't comprehend what was going on.

Basically, if you're into Naruto or just starting to get to know the series, this is a great buy, especially since you can watch it in either Japanese or with English dubbing (I've done both)!

This to me is not a season - especially not when it ended in the middle of the battle on the bridge, why not complete the arc (it's only a few more episodes and people would be less enclined to feel like they had been ripped off with paying so much for a measly 13 episodes).",1174521600,4,698,4.110294117647059

The headband and wrist cuff are made of surprisingly thick sheet metal.  I had to use a wood block to bend them to fit my nephews head and wrist.  I was annoyed at first until I realized that these things can take (and have taken) some rough play.  I'm very happy with them now.

My nephew finally lent me the DVDs long enough that I could watch them.  There is no content more mature than what I've seen on broadcast pokemon episodes.  Also, the episodes are combined.  You just play the DVD through and get the story.  This is completely unlike the my dragon ball Z DVDs where each episode seems to start with a third of the previous episode.  Very nice.

2563458,5,B000FFL35Q,"I love this series so far, I just wish there were more DVDs in each set. There is only 3 in this one totaling 12 episodes. But it is definitely the way to buy this series. The other way is buying it in singles and you don't get as much for your money.

On a note about the series, the characters all have there own issues. The hero of this story, if you can call him that, is Naruto a hyperactive ninja who wants to do well but keep getting in his own way. He is flanked by his two fellow genin ninja Sasuke and Sakura. Who are both are really good at what they do but have some social issues they need to work out. Mainly when dealing with Naruto. Sasuke wants to be the best and restore his family honor so he really doesn't pay attention to the other ninjas. Where as Sakura thinks Sasuke is the hotting this ever, and she wants to date him. The problem is he not interested, and what makes it all worst is that Naruto has the hots for Sakura. Their teacher is my personally favorite character Kakashi Hatake. Who attitude for teaching is unusually at best, but seems to work for these kids. These first episodes are the usual set up ones to get you use to all the characters. The real fun stuff starts at the end of these disc. I would personally advice switching back and forth from English to Japanese just cause certain characters sound better in each languages. I like the Japanese Naruto over the American one just cause his voice is a bit grading in the American one.

2563460,3,B000FFL35Q,">> 13 episodes (for those wondering)

This would be a great deal and worth getting if Naruto ended at episode 50. Unfortunatly the series is REALLY long (and ongoing) as well as loaded with slowely paced episodes which makes the box set not worth its price.

As the review before says, it ends right at the zabuza fight which is where Naruto actually gets interesting.

Just think about it, the best parts in Naruto are around the first 110 episodes, at 40 bucks for 13 episodes thats around 340 dollars! not to mention the series is well over 200 episodes now.

But, the series is amazing. If you're a big fan (like me) maybe you won't mind dishing out that much money for naruto... However, I managed to get a good discount on them which is why im even considering it. It was inevitable that the producers would take advantage of the ongoing Naruto fad.

I would probably wait off until they release more episodes on DVD and make a savings account to afford them when the all come out. That way you won't be left on any cliff hangers =)",1167782400,24,1038,4.4136125654450264
2563471,4,B000FFL35Q,"I got this set assuming that like other anime, this first DVD set would cover the first arc of the series. However, It only covers about half, ending a cliffhanger point in the Zabuza/Haku fight. But that doesn't mean that it's not worth the buy. The first of the three discs in this set sets the foundation of Naruto provides a good insight on how he sees the world and how the world in turn sees him as the Kyuubi (Nine-Tailed Demon Fox). The first arc of the series plays with the idea of what ninja are made to be and what they should be. I don't want to spoil the series for you, so I'll stop there.

The set itself is beautifully packaged in a jewel casing and also comes with a separate booklet showing the storyboard for episode eight. For those who don't know, a storyboard is basically a rough outline of what the episode will be played out little frames, like comic strips. This is pretty interesting, especially since there is some Japanese text written to the side of some pictures. Not only that, but you can use this booklet to compare it to the actual episode and see some slight changes made in terms of how some people move, etc.

Each disc has one of the three main characters on them (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and naturally, has a DVD menu that is based on that particular character. The discs also make sure not to pack too many episodes in them, as to keep the picture quality at its best. So far, most current discs for series in general have five episodes tops as well as some trailers for other shows. These discs have the option to watch the uncut episodes in English, the original Japanese, and Japanese with English subtitles. You can also mix and match these options with your remote control to better compare the English dub with the original script by putting the English audio with the Japanese subtitles. But nonetheless, the episodes do their best to remain consistent with their Japanese counterparts and also keep the original background music.

The third and final disc has all of these extras along with the final few episodes of the set. The two actual special features here are some character designs and some storyboard scans with the option to play that particular scene. Nothing crazy amazing, but they sure are better than just getting some trailers and audio/subs for the episode getting called special features.

All in all, I'd suggest getting this set only if you were a hardcore fan who is tired of fansubs and actually wants to watch the series in pristene footage with accurate subs. But nonetheless, this set was beautifully done and should be how every anime release should done.",1167523200,2,2635,4.611940298507463

2563477,4,B000FFL35Q,"I didn't get into Nartuo until I subscribed to Shonen Jump on a whim.  And I've got to tell you how gripping the story is about an orphan named Naruto, who has this extraordinary goal of becoming Hokage (the #1 Ninja in the world)!  Despite his lack of talent, his hidden abilities and his drive to succeed make his goal that much more real, with each encounter he has either with his squadmates or other characters.

The anime is pretty good, however, at times, the episodes seem to slow down considerably, especially with Episode 2.  However, the action and story picks up the pace as Naruto and his squadmates encounter other dangers later on in the series.  This is one series that I actually have no clear-cut preference of whether I'd rather hear it dubbed or subbed.  (They're equally good and bad).

One thing that I do find annoying is the fact that each episode recaps the previous episode.  Instead, they should cut that out and add 1 or 2 extra minutes of the story to the episode that I'm currently watching.

Overall, this product is a great buy!  Can't wait for the Volume 2 set which is said to be released early December 2006!",1159833600,,1143,4.53170731707317

episodes downloaded on  my computer."" Because this DVD set comes with SPECIAL FEATURES!!!( and free stuff! ) That right there should at least make it a desirable  collectors item! ( so what if it's done by Viz! It's a heck of alot better than 4kids! )

2563494,4,B000FFL35Q,"The long awaited Naruto uncut boxed set. What can I say, I was a little disappointed that it  took so long to get here. The Naruto anime has been out in Japan for 4 years and is still going!

The box itself is okay for a paper boxed set, though the outside is lacking in images. I would like to see the Naruto characters on the box. The forehead protector is okay. The wrist band needs redesigning. The metal is flat when it should be curled so it can curl around your wrist. Maybe my wrist is too thin... I do like the cinch bag though.

The box to hold the dvds reminds me of Hong Kong imports that fold out, I thought they should have a plastic case. I already slightly creased mine taking it to a relatives house.
I liked the storyboard book of episode 8, to actually see the thought that goes into the beloved Naruto series is fascinating and I liked the episode they chose too.

What's sad is that it's only half of season 1, meaning 13 out of 26 eps, it cuts into the middle of the Zabusa and Haku arc. But they chose a good place to cut off because when the 2nd boxset is released it will start with episode 14 which is mainly recaps. I wonder if they will have the Crimson Clover special.

The menu screen are nice and thought out. Each dvd has one member of team 7 in the menu screen.

Though it irks me that they open up with: ""Shonen Jump's Naruto"" It should be ""Kishimoto's Naruto"" Give him credit, without him Naruto wouldn't exist.

For subtitle translations they need to be consistant. For example they constantly change the english name of Kage Bunshin no Jutsu and for Jutsu they sometimes call it a spell when it should mean technique or skill. But it's great to finally hear the Japanese Music again, to see the real opening and closing sequences even though I dislike the ones in the first season.

Over all the boxed set is ok, but could have been better. It's a special edition!! make it special!! Like include a UFO catcher.
It was great to rewatch them on TV, in Japanese, with proper subtitles instead of Engrish. I guess it's another long wait till the next boxset.",1153440000,5,2092,4.305343511450381

Don't get me wrong -- I fully understand the financial and practical value of releasing a dub version in order to reach the widest possible market. I understand that there are many people who just don't care to read the dialog instead of listen to it. And others who just don't want their pictures cluttered up with words.

But there are still those (like me) who want their anime as close to the original form as possible; uncut and in the original language, and with the original seiyuu (voice actor's) performances intact. So if that's what you're looking for, oh Reader Of This Review, RUN out and buy this set as soon as you can. The translation is good (well... except for ""believe it"", *sigh* Okay, okay...
