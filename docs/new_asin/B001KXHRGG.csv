8316466,5,B001KXHRGG,I know Yes have been around for a long time. I love this band.  Their music are different thanother music I listen to. I will buy more music from Yes.,1357948800,2,150,4.0
8316467,2,B001KXHRGG,"I'm not the first to mention this, but it is a real pity that this potentially great release is combined with a very band sound track. It should have been a warning on the sleeve. If I'm not mistaken, both disks have mono sound, and at least disk 1 seems to have only 1 stereo channel on both speakers. E.g. when Jon is playing some additional guitar parts, his notes are loud in the mix, while the interesting solo parts of Steve are hardly audible. And Alan is sometimes very busy drumming, but silent in the mix.

For a true Yes fan, this is a must have, but it won't win new ones.",1342310400,,584,4.168141592920354
8316468,3,B001KXHRGG,"I debated whether to give this two or three stars.  As stated in other reviews, there are a lot of problems with the audio on this DVD. The poor sound quality really detracts from its value, but it is an interesting historical record of the Patrick Moraz era of Yes.  I'm not sure there is any other DVD that has all of the Relayer album played in concert.  For guitar players, there are good shots of Steve Howe playing The Clap and Mood For A Day.  The latter song is not listed as one of the tracks, but is played instead of the second part of I've Seen All Good People.",1332201600,,573,4.135135135135135
8316469,4,B001KXHRGG,"Yes are a great band that has went through many changes and the addition of keyboard player Patricc Moraz makes them...well different. Relayer studio album isn't bad but just sounds very cluttered to me. Live on this dvd, Moraz fairs well on his contributions to the band but the previous Yes material he just ain't cutting it !!! I can see, finally why they parted ways. Having said all that this dvd is history for the band and well worth the listen.",1324339200,,452,4.524390243902439
8316470,3,B001KXHRGG,Let me start by saying that it's always great to see such classic 70's rock bands such as Yes on video live in their prime... but why anyone would release a video of such a CLASSIC band such as Yes & not fix the flaws in the sound on here is beyond me... the sound problems on this video could have easily been fixed & done properly... Yes fans deserve better.... but it is still good to have...,1311897600,3,395,4.076923076923077
8316471,4,B001KXHRGG,"I am glad to finally get this on DVD.
I purchased vol 2 over a year ago and now I have the complete concert.
This one has non of the drop outs or sound wobbles that disc 2 has but this has the sound mix up and down,
Still, once you get past that you have a time capsule of a band no one will ever see that way again.
As with the other DVD this has a nice clear image.  I don't have a flat screen hd yet so I don't know what it looks like on that but they need to come out with a bluray with both parts on one disc.  Simple.

(1/2/2013) Update on this concert discs ""one"" and ""two"" since I now have a Sharp 60in 1080p screen is to say that the image looks great (the company that produced this did a quality transfer to DVD disc and does not have the artifacts that some films I own).
The sound isn't the best by todays standards but there is something about these discs that makes it ok for me.  I did not see them until 3 or 4 years after this but in its raw state makes it feel so real to me.  Its hard to explain but there it is.  I just love this concert and thank God they got the BBC to record it and not some amature.  Put it on, light one up and have fun.  Forget your troubles and let them take you to uncharted waters.",1306800000,7,1228,3.76953125
8316472,4,B001KXHRGG,"ONE OF THE GREAT EARLY YES SHOWS' PART TWO WAS TOO EXSPENSIVE AT $34.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE $22.",1252800000,,104,4.0
