The ""Wyoming Cattlemens Association"" hold a meeting on this theft. An alarm sounds outside, there is a robbery. A man shoots at the fleeing automobile. ""Nice shooting."" The man from the Department of Commerce has a job for him. Roy grew up in that area and would not be suspicious. Cowboys sing as they ride, they meet Roy. Roy meets Judy next. Gabby complains about cattle thefts. There is a meeting of the ranch owners. They want to pool resources and coordinate their activities. One horse threw a shoe. Gabby rides with Roy and Judy.

Miriam gives a party on Saturday night. There is music and dancing. [There is comedy.] Then a song. The rustlers struck again! Where did they go? Jim caught one of them, he's one of Miriam's crew. They will take care of Jim and get rid of his horse too. The next morning they notice Jim's absence. When his body is found Roy finds sand in one boot. [Trace evidence.] Roy finds that hidden cave, and Bob finds him. A shot misses them! Roy rides after the shooter and captures him. ""He's one of the Hardy men."" But Roy is seen near that tunnel! Roy talks to Miriam about the rustlers. He tests her and she fails! The shooting begins, Roy is trapped in the ranch house. Help arrives just in time. Judy and Miriam struggle. Will Roy stay or move on? And so it ends. [No mention of the trials and sentencing.]

This is an interesting story about rustling done at one of the cattle ranches. Did this reflect war-time fears about a ""fifth column""? My copy had low contrast washed-out video. Some of these movies were cut back to 53 minutes to fit into an hour of TV with advertising.",1410393600,,1800,4.448484848484848
