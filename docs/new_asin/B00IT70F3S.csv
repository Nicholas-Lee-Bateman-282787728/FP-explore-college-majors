6292569,4,B00IT70F3S,"Ultron: You are annoyingly nave.
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday.

Avengers: Age of Ultron goes full throttle start to finish, which also means it shouldve slowed down to let everyone catch their breath a few times.  We all know the plot, but as the devils in the details, the question is how do all the pieces fit together.  The answer is: Very well, indeed.  Even if some of them get forced into place.

Whats Good: Its a Joss Whedon vehicle.  That means the rare synergy of action, humor and drama weve come to expect from him.  Lots of cameos and appearances from supporting characters- Sam Wilson/Falcon and James Rhodes/War Machine for example- as well as other denizens of the MCU.  Even Idris Elba shows up for a minute as Heimdall (hey- thats three black guys!  Wow.).  Theres also all the references and easter eggs youll have fun spotting: like a certain African nation, for example.

For those (rightly) complaining about Hawkeyes lack of well, anything remotely useful, brace yourselves.  Clint Barton looms large in this one and is quite relevant to the plot.  Go figure.  Besides that theres quite a few twists you won't expect and things definitely get worse before they get better.  The Visions debut is a bit shaky, but works out ok.

Whats Bad: believe it or not, the movie does have some warts.  Noticeable in their absence are Pepper Potts and Jane Foster; though explained via some light comedy, you still wonder why they're not around.  One of my main bones to pick was Ultrons origin sequence; it was surprisingly brief, almost rushed- like it was only there because it had to be.  He almost literally just snaps into being and is already rolling. It really wouldnt have hurt anything to spend a little more time on Ultrons development and a lot less on the 3D-driven mindless, wholescale destruction fight scenes (and yes, I do mean the Iron Man vs Hulk battle.  That one might as well have been ripped from anime).  Because frankly, some of them didn't make much sense and kind of send you into sensory overload.  More than a few times theres simply too much going on here; you're exhausted just watching them.

And the emergence of the Maximoff twins brings us right back to the ongoing unanswered question of how the X-Men figure into all of this.  Because theres no way they can, even with Magnetos children in the mix.

Whats Left: the blockbuster youve been waiting for that sets up just about every other Marvel movie on the horizon.  Oh, and theres only one mid-credits scene to watch for- and its a killer!  Hint: its foreshadowed during the movie.  4/5 stars.",1430438400,5,2597,4.698447893569845
6292570,4,B00IT70F3S,"Spoiler Warning:  When Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) tries to build an artificial intelligence named Ultron that would protect Earth from more alien attacks for instance. Ultron (voiced by James Spader) gets a mind ""and body"" of his own and Earth's protector becomes their greatest enemy.
  Despite Age of Ultron being long without a solid story. Age of Ultron is anything but a Michael Bay movie. Because it entertained me rather than just making me deaf while checking my watch like I did with Transformers: Age of Extinction.
  Ultron isn't as memorable as he could have been. Since it gets repetitive seeing many versions of him destroyed over and over again. Despite great voice work by James Spader. Vision (Paul Bettany) though is much more of a succesful addition to the film.
  My problems with the film are mostly the Hulk/Bruce Banner and Black Widow romance and taking the time to tell us Hawkeye has a family. The film slows down just to put the Avengers at Hawkeye's farm where they regroup against Ultron.
  That reminded me of how the Ninja Turtles regroup by always hiding out at farms lol. While Hawkeye having a wife and kids doesn't make you more interested in him like I guess Whedon intended.
  The Widow and Hulk romance didn't work for me since there was no hint in the first film that she can calm down the Hulk. They should have brought back Betty Ross to calm down the Hulk. Sparks fly when Widow is with Captain America...not Bruce Banner. So they should have built on her chemistry with Captain more  from Winter Soldier.
  The Avengers not knowing Agent Coulson is alive finally also bugs me. Since according to Whedon Couslon is alive on tv but still dead in the movies. Huh ? And Tony Stark is a bit too much of a jerk to care about in this one. He's too non-solant about the fact the he created Ultron who wants to destroy mankind and barely sees what the big deal is.
  Still Avengers; Age of Ultron is pretty kick ass for super hero fans. And if it was just comic nerds writing the reviews at rottentomatoes; the reviews would be 100%. The scenes with Vision especially made it easy to forget my problems with it. And yes there's some great action like Hulk vs Iron Man in his Hulk buster armor.",1430352000,3,2231,4.553884711779449
6292571,5,B00IT70F3S,"The story line is a basic Avengers vs. Ultron, a robot with artificial intelligence who is aided by two human experiments. This battle requires the Avengers to pull out all the stops and come together as a team. Midway through the film we get to know the Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) family. We are also introduced to a new Avengers. The film ends with it being open to a sequel which will result in them battling an even greater force.

As always the action is long. The film develops the Hulk/Black Widow romance and Captain America uses a swear word or two. There is some humorous banter as you would expect, but not at the level it was in past films. Gwyneth Paltrow is not in the film. Look for Stan Lee. The film does answer the question ""Iron Man or Hulk?""

The film asks basic questions about war, killing, and the use of violence in general but doesn't get so heavy as to weigh down the popcorn.",1430352000,,899,4.377245508982036
6292572,5,B00IT70F3S,"In only seven short years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has revolutionized the manner in which we enjoy movies.  The characters and their storylines are only portions of the pie, while the fluidity and continuity is what makes this rapidly growing nexus the uncontrollable mega-monster that it is today.

From the Iron Man and Captain America films to Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy, one would think these tales would eventually reach their peak  and create a spiraling domino effect that would weaken the bond between them.  After all, nothing lasts forever, right?  Well, something tells me the brain trust behind the MCU doesnt see it that way.  And, theres nothing in this latest MCU chapter, Avengers: Age of Ultron, to indicate a lack of momentum going into the future.  In fact, it appears as though Marvel is just getting started

SYNOPSIS / POTENTIAL SPOILERS
Joss Whedon (Marvels The Avengers, Serenity) returns to write and direct The Avengers: Age of Ultron, picking-up in the aftermath of Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  The Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner), are in a waning war against Hydra  cleaning-up their last remnants.

In their latest battle, the Avengers encounter two super-powered individuals, Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and through exposure to Scatlet Witchs magic, begin experiencing their greatest fears.  Iron Mans experience leads him to create a program, with the help of Banner, to put an iron solider throughout the world  as a means to constantly serve and protect.  But, the outcome is far more diabolical in nature when it produces an artificial intelligence, called Ultron (voiced by James Spader), which believes the elimination of humanity is the best course of action for peace and prosperity.

REACTION
Whether youll ultimately deem Age of Ultron to be better than the first film will be a debate worthy of endless discussion, however, Joss Whedons script and plot points hardly produce earth shattering revelations  and is far too reminiscent of Iron Man 2 for comfort.  Naturally, the comparison between those two films stems from the villains motives  where youll find Scarlet Witch and Quicksilvers beef with Iron Man (and the Avenges, who are seemingly guilty by association) to be nearly identical to that of Ivan Vanko.

Minor plot complaints aside, which still work perfectly fine for what they achieve, will not hinder your viewing experience in the least.  With that said, Age of Ultron is not far from being considered a perfect comic book film  delving into a plethora of prudent, untapped areas that fans have been clamoring for, such as a greater emphasis on the previous films lesser utilized characters, like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and the Hulk  all of whom player significantly greater roles than they have in any other MCU installments from the past (aside from Bruce Banner, who had his own film  despite the fact that it didn't star Mark Ruffalo).

The big three also receive their fair share of screen time  and, not unlike the first film, spend a considerable amount of time verbally sparring with one another.  Thus, a clear-cut line is drawn in the sand between Iron Man and Captain America that will obviously spill over into next years Captain America: Civil War  and, believe it or not, it looks as though even Thor clearly picks his side (although he excuses himself from the fray).  Nevertheless, the main talking points will revolve around where this battle with Ultron leaves these three heavy hitters after the dust has settled.

Speaking of Ultron, its nice to see a formidable villain take the reigns in the noticeable absence of Loki and Thanos (whos does appear briefly, though).  Regardless, Ultron fits the bill of a super-villain magnificently, though  and James Spader quite simply knocks it out of the park with his voice work.  The back-and-forth exchanges between Spader and Downey, Jr. provide a unique father/son dynamic, inevitably leading the creation of The Vision (one of the films most memorable occurrences).

The Vision (voiced by Paul Bettany) is one of several new characters, along with the aforementioned Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, to be fully integrated into the team.  Elizabeth Olsens Scarlet Witch, more so than the rest, is the most interesting (not to mention stunning) addition to the franchise, and should be a significant asset moving forward.  Quicksilver, on the other hand, is the complete opposite of his X-Men: Days of Future Past counterpart  as Aaron Taylor-Johnson spends the majority of his screen presence being underutilized and under-appreciated.

Outside of the various storylines (and there a ton to pay attention to) and character developments, the vast amount of CGI-heavy action is almost overwhelming (and visually breathtaking).  The action sequences are fun (especially the Avengers Assemble shots at the beginning and end of the film), while the lighthearted comedy is also just as entertaining, too.  In particular, the scene where everyone attempts to pick-up Thors hammer is a comic book lovers delight.  And, while theres no need to spoil it for anyone, Ill just simply say that before the film is over  someone other than Thor will, indeed, wield Mjlnir.

Additionally, there are plenty of other fun Easter eggs and random cameos that continue to tie the entire MCU tighter together than ever before.  Even though plenty of familiar faces show-up throughout the course of the film, like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle), its hard not to be overly greedy and disappointed about the characters we don't see, such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, or Ms. Marvel.  Oh, well  continued anticipation for such occurrences are reportedly not too far off in the distance, anyway.

Overall
Avengers: Age of Ultron is everything that you could possibly hope and ask for in terms of entertainment value from a superhero team-themed sequel.  There were a few obvious areas where it could have been better, possibly more original  but as a whole, theres very little to complain about.  Still, the anticipation for Age of Ultron was nowhere near the amount of excitement generated and established by Marvels The Avengers.  That doesnt mean this latest chapter isn't as potent as its predecessor  because it surely is, yet Age of Ultron clearly had to work harder than ever to out-do the epic events leading-up to and taking place during the battle of New York (prompting another major battle that was eerily similar in scale).  In the end, Joss Whedon has constructed another well-rounded summer blockbuster that is destined to dominate and squeeze the box office for nearly $2 billion.  It also sets-up the future of the MCUs Phase III  as we look towards (and endlessly discuss) the potential events of Infinity Wars Part 1 & 2 in 2018 and 2019 (respectively).",1430265600,7,7060,5.125

In fact, all of the technical aspects are first-rate: color/photography, CGI, sound, etc.  When you watch a Disney Marvel film, you get a top-notch show.  Obviously, this ain't a Marvel film from the 1980s or early 1990s. Ugh.

Anyway, the main weakness is the same for a lot of Marvel films: a so-so villain.  James Spader's performance is great for what he's given to do, but the motivations are a bit muddy and abrupt.  I guess it provides indirect commentary of some of our social ills, but that's about it.

However, the action is spot-on--especially when the Avengers are fighting each other: it's quick and brutal.  Not quite Civil War good, but still pretty awesome.",1531008000,,736,4.785714285714286

At the party, watch the various Avengers attempt to lift Thor's hammer, and see how Cap was able to nudge Mjolnir and Thor's look of surprise and relief.

6292652,5,B00IT70F3S,"Some people think this is a lesser film in comparison to other larger Marvel titles. But I think its great in its own way.

In this movie we really get to see the Avengers together in action scenes throughout the entire movie. Something that hasn't been done yet in other films. We seen them working together in creative ways which I think is really cool.

This movie also really sets the tone for so many movies to follow as it shows the fears and misgivings that will slowly break the team apart. You see Thor and Hulk going their own ways. You see Tony Stark worrying so much about protecting the world and he ignores the potential dangers. Hawkeye gets his best character arc to date.

There is so much good here for a fan to not enjoy.",1526688000,,740,4.3478260869565215
6292653,4,B00IT70F3S,"It's difficult to review a film that's so typically 'blockbuster' and checks all of the boxes for a major Hollywood action movie nowadays. At the same time, though, the performances by the talented actors and actresses in the film make it all feel mostly worthwhile. 'Age of Ultron' gets sadly settled with a gigantic number of plot points that it both needs to carry on from previous movies as well as set down to establish for future releases. What it does excel at, though, are the fascinating moments where Paul Bettany, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader, and others get to reflect on why they do what what they do.

The guys at RedLetterMedia put it well when they stated that the movie came off like a gigantic double-cheeseburger from a middling restaurant. There's a lot to chew on, perhaps too much, and plenty of that is pretty cheesy, but it's worth picking up overall. I feel the same way.",1526688000,,899,4.654088050314465

6292657,4,B00IT70F3S,"Age of Ultron has a reputation for being the worst Avengers movie and one of the weakest films in the MCU. In that regard, I don't entirely disagree. The climax is bloated, Thor's vision is stupid, and there's the usual problem of Marvel villains being uninteresting. The latter most problem being an especially glaring issue in this film since this is supposed to be the 'darker, more personal' Avengers film where the heroes prove that being heroes is a good thing. Ultron has a few good lines but not quite enough character to give the climax a solid 'oomph'.

All that said, I still enjoy this film. Avengers banter is great as always and, while a little bloated, the action scenes are exciting spectacles. Plus, this film has one thing that the other Avengers movies don't (not even Infinity War), it shows us the Avengers just hanging out, being friends. Those scenes show that these characters really do care for each other beyond just 'I need their help to save the world'. It made them a lot more endearing to me.",1526169600,,1022,4.6464088397790055

6292702,2,B00IT70F3S,"Where do I even begin?

First off, this movie is not as good as the first Avengers. If I am being honest, I wouldnt even place this in my top ten Marvel films. Its bad. Like really bad and I am so thankful Joss Whedon isn't directing anymore Marvel movies. Hes a semi-decent director but hes terrible at writing. One of the major failings of this film is how the characters are written.

Tony has become a complete and total jerk. There is nothing likeable about him and the entire movie? Its his fault. Like everything in this movie is his fault yet he tries to act as if he didn't do anything wrong. The only two characters in this film that are well written are Captain America and Thor. Everyone else? Not so much

There is also this weird romance between Bruce aka the Hulk and Black Widow. This relationship makes zero sense. Their attraction was never established. It comes right out of left field and it doesnt hold a lot of weight. The romantic moments between them? Theyre dull. There is no chemistry between Mark and Scarlett.

There is also a sub-plot about Hawkeye having a family. Again, it makes no sense, doesnt add anything to the movie and its pointless. Who cares if Hawkeye has a family?

Then there is the characters of Wanda and Pietro. Theyre okay but they still feel a bit pointless. Wanda fars a be better than Pietro, showing some good character growth but there are times where she falls flat.

This is also the film that introduces Vision and he seems like an interesting character. Again, he does suffer a bit thanks to Whedons crap writing but he manages to be entertaining and likeable.

Really, this film is just a mess. All the positive aspects of this movie do not outweigh the bad. This was the start of Marvel films taking a turn. I would probably give this film a D+.",1522713600,,1804,4.4650455927051675

Everything you would expect is here, including top-flight effects and a huge amount of spectacle. The performances are good, with the cast are clearly very comfortable in their roles now that theyve done it all before. The story is acceptable without being remarkable and it zips along at a good pace. Theres nothing new here but its an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.",1522022400,,652,4.821428571428571

6292740,5,B00IT70F3S,"Another notch for Marvel Cinematic Universe Success. Avengers Age of Ultron continues to spread forth an amazing collection of actors together in a phenomenal sequel to the Avengers. Joss Whedon does a marvelous job not just once but twice.

After the Captain America 2 Winter Soldier and Agents of SHIELD Season 1 in which the offshoot Nazi Terrorist group HYDRA is still in existence, promoting terrorism into the 21st century and using SHIELD and the governments of the world to in order to rule the world. Avengers 2 Age of Ultron brings the Avengers to destroy HYDRA, but they are manipulated into creating a peace keeping initiative that blows up in their faces. Ultron, the artificial intelligence created by Tony Stark to prevent alien threats like Avengers or world threats like Captain America 2 turns on them and intends to destroy. This is more than just an action movie for the sake of action, but brings to mind the importance of fighting the good fight and the limits of power. Its nice to know more things about the Avengers as they develop in the face of their new enemies and their own demons. Its nice to know that a few years living in the 21st century that Steve Rogers still misses his dreams of a normal life, or how Natasha Romanov was trained as an assassin and robbed of a life she still wants, don't get me started on Clint Barton and of course Tony Stark's ambitions. They are friends but they have a chance to be a family and more as they fight to save the world.

All this and more is just amazing. Nice to welcome back the old but also some new faces. As well as see plenty of great action. Some people complain about some stuff. The movie isn't as fresh as there is a feeling of 'sequelitis' as there is feeling to make the movie relevant. I won't go into specifics but I do believe its a little exaggerated. Joss Whedon also has said that he wanted to do more, bring more heroes and continue to develop things well into the next couple of films. Both of course didn't happen.

Still this movie is really good and well worthy of a Blu-ray and Digital Copy.",1518739200,,2088,4.489473684210527

Ultron should have had more screen time and dialogue.  It is a worthy Marvel movie and one you need to watch, it was worth the rental.  All the team is doing their best with the material and the inner jokes are fun.  I can see the Joss Whedon writing and directing pedigree come out with Firefly hints.

6292811,3,B00IT70F3S,"I know I'm in the minority here in giving this film any less than rave reviews. It took a while for me to figure out what bothered me about it. I eventually realized that since Ultron was no more than a Tony Stark surrogate replete with many character traits of his creator, the viewers are subjected to the effete sarcasm, narcissism and smugness of 2 Tony Starks - when 1 is more than enough. With his ill advised, almost demented creation of Ultron, Stark was singlehandedly responsible for everything bad that happened in this film, including the violent deaths of innocent people, yet he got little more than a stern dressing down from his fellow superheroes. And then in ""Civil War"" he has the gall to impose the Sokovia Accords upon his peers - when he is the reason the accords had to be drafted in the first place.",1509667200,,823,4.530201342281879

I think what I found most distracting was Ultron's voice. There was just something off about how his voice was mixed into the rest of the audio. Too much of the time Ultron sounded more like a voice-over narrator rather than an actual character in the film. Add to that, the concept was a bit ridiculous, but hey! It's a comic book movie. I'll forgive it. As always, I felt that the 3D helped sell the reality and immersion into the world it portrayed.",1506729600,,577,4.452830188679245

I really hate it when Tony screws up this badly, but watching the rest of the gang get him out of the mess is extremely entertaining. No movie that introduces you to Wanda could be all bad, anyway.

However, the main issue here is that this movie is mainly an attempt at fan service and it is extremely obvious. Much of the movie's runtime is devoted to subplots, subplots, and more subplots. It could have benefited from more Ultron and less interpersonal team drama among the Avengers. We have an entire movie universe to cover all of that in, and we won't get Ultron again anytime soon, if ever.

Those are really my only complaints though. On the whole, I was satisfied.",1494374400,,700,4.729508196721311

Plot: Tony Stark starts this Project Ultron that creates Ultron, an autonomous robot that's essentially unbeatable and boring. Oh yeah, Hawkeye has a wife and kid. Thor is Thor. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (who dies later) come in to the movie because why not. Then I passed out from boredom, woke up, rewatched what I missed, then prayed for a zombie apocalypse or Vision to kill me. I was literally fast forwarding through the movie just to get somewhere interesting. These Marvel movies shouldn't be longer than 2 hours - one hour and 40 would be ideal.

6292967,4,B00IT70F3S,"This movie plays better with a casual watch in your living room than the first time in a movie theater.

Backstory: I was never much of an Avengers fan, which is why the first Avengers movie was such a revelation to me. It felt like the first true comic book movie ever made.

Sequels, historically, fare poorly against their original and I was never the biggest fan of Ultron when he was first created. Granted, that was far before all the AI machines trying to destroy the world stories that began cropping up in the 80's on, but I would have to say I preferred the storyline from Abnett/Lanning in Nova (Annihilation: Conquest). Of course, that wasn't the Avengers, so there you are.

This movie has all the characters from the first one PLUS Quicksilver PLUS Scarlet Witch PLUS Ultron PLUS...ah, you get the point. Along with all the personal reflection and sneak info (infinity stones!), it's just a bit on the chubby side.

That said, sitting through it the second time, I came to appreciate what a significant and effective linchpin the movie is to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. Well-crafted from that aspect.

As expected, the visual effects have been ratcheted up (along with the budget, so you get more Hulk CGI time). Iron Man continues his somewhat annoying trend of having as many Iron Man suits as I have regular ones. Beyond the usual ""star factor"" focus on Downey Jr., the movie really plays up its most human members, which leaves Thor as the odd man out as far as screen time (not to worry, he's already had 2 movies on his own).

If I could quibble with anything in the MCU, it's the shortcuts taken with the infinity stones. First, we take the cosmic cube and call it an infinity stone, losing the whole original Thanos arc that was so much fun and the declaration of some of the others (not identified here for those of you who haven't seen all the MCU films yet), makes it seem too convenient for the ultimate gathering of stones for Thanos and his Infinity War. Thank goodness they're at least planning to allow two films for that (it only took over the whole Marvel Comics line for several months).

Bottom line, though, it's a fun movie and much richer in a leisurely watching with your remote pause button.",1487462400,,2239,4.5964912280701755

I am kind of tired of wealthy or good looking white guys always saving the damn day. Can we maybe have some superheroes of color, maybe even an ordinary looking person and, of course, please add some more women of color as well. Women can actually kick ass. Furthermore (and I know this is somewhat confronted in the next Avengers movie), sometimes I watch the destruction caused by these 'heroes' and I think, well great there goes that guys job or some poor working class person is going to have to clean that up. I don't know, maybe I need to write my own super hero book.

6293141,3,B00IT70F3S,"Age of Ultron is basically, based on hype from last year, a mixed bag follow up to the 2012 hit film. Though it's great to see Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and others return with the introductions of Quicksilver (MCU one not the X-Men version seen in  a aforementioned film) and Scarlet Witch in the MCU. ...... Shouldn't they be in a X-Men movie? Fox still owns the movie rights. How is it possible to have X-Men characters in a Marvel CU film is Marvel does not have granted permission from Fox to have X-Men in it? I can see if there were to have a X-Men film that bombed 3 times (ahem. Apocalypse), Fox would have to lend the movie rights back to Marvel and so that way we could've gotten a first MCU X-Men made film. Would the Inhumans count?",1480550400,,750,4.28169014084507

6293233,3,B00IT70F3S,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the second Avengers film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It features Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and introduces Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. The Avengers assault the stronghold of Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), Hydras #1 thug, in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia. Beyond wreaking havoc on the locals, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) recovers a scepter containing one of the six Infinity Stones before being bewitched by Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and experiencing a horrible vision. Wanda and her brother Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) are products of Struckers twisted experiments. She possesses telekinetic powers, and he has superhuman speed. Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that the scepter holds an alien computer and want to integrate it into Starks global peacekeeping initiative, called Ultron. But the computer hijacks J.A.R.V.I.S. and gains control of Starks Ironman suits. He emerges as Ultron (James Spader), who manipulates the worlds computers at will and is bent on destroying the Avengers.

Age of Ultron is never convincing. Ultron is not an interesting villain, visually or thematically. Hes not a fully-formed character. Hes a computer program run amok or a misguided maniac. He has only one note. And he multiplies himself, which makes him disposable and boring. Likewise, the blossoming romance between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner is unconvincing. He looks like her father, and there is no chemistry between them. Tony Stark plays the mad scientist to the point of being a deluded and dangerous megalomaniac, completely uncaring of the consequences, which is not good. Superheroes can be antiheroes and are usually vigilantes, but this lot is no better than the villains. The action sequences are overblown and goofy, as usual. You either like that style, or you dont. But I found the Avengers too flippant about death and destruction, as if it were supposed to be funny rather than suspenseful. I like the casting and the visual effects for Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. We don't see much of Vision, as he comes in near the end of the story, and its not clear what he is going to be about. Age of Ultron is a lackluster effort on the whole.",1475971200,,2308,5.237837837837838

However, when it came down to it, they turned him into a joke. Complete with a repeat comical takedown from the hulk. A moment im sure was forced on Joss Whedon by the studio because ""everyone loved it in the first one"".  Im still waiting for my badass villain! One who can stand alone and still put up a fight against the avengers. Maybe thanos will be my man. This is still a good flick though. Wouldve been better if so much wasn't cut out. The thor vs vision fight is awesome. So if you're a marvel fan don't hesitate. Just don't expect the same feels the first one gave us.",1474070400,,706,4.348484848484849

6293319,3,B00IT70F3S,"I found the CGI in this movie to be very poorly done, especially in the beginning! I don't know maybe it is better in the movies but I thought this would be a good watch because of all the hype behind it. Another thing to point out is I also don't care for superhero movies but I do think they have a great cast of actors, which was the reason why I chose to watch this in the first place. I won't bother to go into detail, which may discredit my review however this is all based on personal opinion and I think if I had to choose between superhero movies I still think that Man of Steel was the first superhero movie I ever liked. Maybe the captain America movie before this was good too (I haven't seen Civil War). I would consider watching superhero movies simply because that is all Hollywood is making their focus on at the moment but this movie is an OKAY movie to watch.

I would watch the Force Awakens or Skyfall just to restore my faith in the movie industry. I look for a few things in a movie,

- It has to be immediately get my attention

- I have to care about what's going on

- I have to be surprised about the plot

- It has to be original (not done before or cheesy/cliche)

The Avengers was a seemingly rushed film which made it an OKAY FILM.....

6293384,5,B00IT70F3S,"Just finished watching this, I believe, for the third time. There are some movies that I certainly feel you can only watch when you feel a blue moon is out. This is one of those movies. The reason?? I simply say - WOW!!
With the creation of the MCU, everything is intertwined. That's what ultimately pulls me in. Not that long ago, I finished going through season two of Agents Of Shield, which parallels with Ultron. You watch the episode where Reina predicts that metal will fall from the sky,.....and that's a direct reference to this films climax, without giving anything away.
I have seen plenty of reviews that have fans scratching their heads and tearing the film to pieces with their negative comments. We all know you can't please everyone. Hey, I'm actually one of the few people I know who enjoyed Batman & Robin, My standards aren't to criticize everything, just to take it at face value and try to enjoy the movies I choose to watch. No, I thought this was a great addition to the MCU, and I can't wait to see how the next two infinity stones appear and end up in Thanos' left handed glove.

6293510,1,B00IT70F3S,"Well I am sure who ever reads this is either looking for a reason not to buy/watch this, or they're looking at this in shock that someone has a differing opinion from the majority. Either way, heres my honest review.

Nothing against the blu ray itself, its fine, mine works, no issues, just like any other blu ray really. The quality and or clarity is what you'd expect from blu ray. Sound is the best part of the movie.

Now the film.....I got it as a gift. I would never buy any of these movies, there is yet to be one Marvel Cinematic Universe movie I liked, but I will say Guardians of the Galaxy was okay. The casting choices weren't bad, which to me is one of the main problems of these movies.

I actually am some one that has actually read the comics, for real, I am not one of those people that just runs with the trends and pretends I am a fan. I didn't read all of the comics mind you, mostly because I lost interest in some of them.

Going into this movie, I thought well, how bad could it be. The first was your typical introduction super hero, so to me this was like the real first true movie of the Avengers arcs. I knew Thanos wouldn't be in it because if he was in it there would be way they could top it, which sets the tone for the movie in my eyes. Its just something to quench your thirst until Thanos.

No spoilers, so I will say the story is so average, its brutal at this point. We have been seeing Super Hero after Super Hero movie several times each year now. Its like watching a michael bay movie with all show and no go, except this movie hardly even had any show, it wasn't even the action epic youd hope it be.

One complaint I have is that the weakest, most dull ""heroes"" overshadow the real super heroes. The casting choices were atrocious. Scarlett Witches accent felt totally fake and I couldn't get past it. I was very aware she was acting. And once again, Captain America SUCKS. Chris Evens was an okay human torch, I could buy it. Chris Evens as Captain America, it just doesnt fit him. And that girl from How I met Your Mother??? Come on. There was nobody else you could cast? The fight/battle scenes were nothing special, nothing you haven't already seen, yet most of you still seem to throw your money at for some reason. I guess its easier to go with the trend than to stand up and say it sucks. People were dumping on the Batman vs Superman movie for the same reasons they loved this movie. I don't get it.

I wanted to give this movie 2 stars, because if I was to rate it out of ten I would give it like a 3.5. However, this movie could not hold my attention enough to even keep me awake. I fell asleep watching it and I wasn't even tired. Everything about this movie just screams below average. These movies don't feel like movies, they feel like long episodes of a TV show. A Netflix exclusive, but that would be an insult to Netflix exclusives because at least they put some effort into those shows, instead of just throwing stuntmen and good looking actors and actresses in front of a green screen with a colossal budget and calling it a super hero movie.

I cant wait for this super hero fad to end, then all the casual viewers can go ruin some other franchise and the directors can actually put effort into movies and take risks. But I guess I am in the minority here, the star ratings show that. Shame!",1469059200,2,3353,4.236306729264475

6293567,4,B00IT70F3S,"I love this movie, and my heart wants me to give it at least a near perfect review. Scenes like the opening, group lunge are absolutely thrilling, and that's only one example. There are four problems for me concerning this movie, one relatively small and two ridiculously big editing mistakes. First, the small problem: just like in the debut Avengers film, Iron Man (due to overwhelming popularity) is portrayed as far more powerful than in the comics. In the first movie the example was his fight with Thor, just go flip through the JMS run of Mighty Thor to see how the Thunder God handles Stark...leaving him a grounded, mangled puppy whining about needing a ride. In AOU, Stark suckerpunches the Hulk and knocks him out. Sorry folks, a full powered Hulk ain't EVER going down that easy, even against a pissed of Sentry. Banner stuck a gun in his mouth, fired it, and the Hulk spit it out. Think on that. The scene is however, very entertaining...it's just the way it ENDED that bugs me.

Two big problems I have with AOU: one, why didn't Scarlet Witch press her advantage against Cap early in the movie (in a scene that obviously needed to be cut), Steve went ahead and knocked the hell out of Strucker anyway, useless scene there; two, due to some horrifically bad editing (once again), we're left with myriad questions regarding Thor and the ultimately befuddling pool scene.

AOU is a movie that kind of screwed the fans over by not releasing an extended cut that might have helped tie up some glaringly obvious loose ends. Forgetting that, if you love superhero movies (especially if you're into Marvel), it's an essential watch. Might help to ignore this review lol!",1468454400,,1676,4.716723549488054

It's not the best Marvel has made, but it's definitely a fun ride.",1467763200,,300,5.142857142857143
6293589,5,B00IT70F3S,"Unenviable was the task ahead of Joss Whedon when it came down to make Avengers Age of Ultron. How could he hope to top or even match the success of the first Avengers film? Expectations are ridiculously high for the second movie, but thats what happens when the first one grosses almost two billion dollars and becomes the template in which everyone aspires to duplicate.

Have no fear, Whedon is here, as the mastermind and architect (along with Kevin Feige) behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe was more than up to the task. This time, Whedon not only had to juggle six protagonists, but introduce four new characters, while also servicing two additional and four huge cameos.

Whereas the previous sequels in the MCU could focus on just the story and allow the films to be more than a superhero film (i.e., Iron Man 3 buddy cop, Winter Soldier, political thriller) Age of Ultron needs to be more. It needs to continue to be the thread in which the overall narrative of the MCU continues to weave.

With all of that in mind, Whedon had a mighty task in making it all work, and honestly, work it does. At one point on screen, there were 12 heroes being heroic at the same time; twelve. Most films have issues juggling one character, let alone several.

Opening up much like Star Trek Into Darkness does, the audience is able to see the Avengers acting like a well oiled machine, with code word contingencies and the ability to calm one of its members when no longer needed. Its a terrific moment for fans, and is just the first of many over the quickly-paced two-hour, twenty-six minute ride.

The greatest compliment this long time fan can give the film, is that Whedon once again breathed life into the characters we grew up reading over the past fifty-plus years. To see the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision on screen as Avengers, to see characters from the other films (War Machine, Falcon) remind viewers that this is not just one film in the ever-expanding universe, but the next chapter, was truly breathtaking.

Whedon never forgets what the Avengers are about, and that is the key to the success. When Ultrons final plan comes to fruition, the team is tasked with several different objectives, the least of which is saving the civilian population. This comes right off the pages of the Avengers comic with Cap leading the way and giving directives. It is a contrast to some of the hero destruction porn moviegoers sometimes witness and is not a criticism of those films, but rather an example that the Avengers are always about being more than what is expected.

Ultron by the way, voiced by James Spader, was a terrific foil and protagonist, twisting the teams overall mission of peace, while also staying true to the characters origins from the pages of the Avengers. There is not a lot of time with all the ingredients that Whedon must throw into this recipe to service everything possible, but he does a wonderful job of bringing Ultron to life, with all the Daddy issues the character had in the comics.

Considering all those elements, Whedon also gives terrific character moments to the entire team, which is impressive when considering how many members are on the squad.

Marvel will continue its hot streak at the box office with Age of Ultron. Fans will attempt to compare it to the other films previously released or use superlatives as best Marvel film ever. In the end, it will take its rightful place in the canon and does not need to be compared to any of the universes other movies - its the Avengers.",1467676800,,3533,4.685483870967742

6293647,4,B00IT70F3S,"This movie has the coolest shots ever. It has one of the best casts with every single actor having chemistry with anyone they're with and it's awesome. So this movie would be a 3.5 for me because of the plot. I love the motivation, there's no more SHIELD as far as they're concerned and no *one* big brother entity is egging them on to save the world (unless you're that nerd who likes to watch every bit of MCU I do suggest AoS). Cool beans. What I don't understand is why would they have Natasha in charge of calming down the Hulk. As I recall Cap was barely able to give Hulk an order he liked in Avengers. Tony kept on pushing buttons in hopes that Bruce would hulk out in front of him and then got excited when it happened. Was Black Widow so useless to the writers that she had to be assigned this ""special"" job?
That's just one of the problems I had. Stark and Banner creating vision was odd for me. Just the fact that they got to keep the scepter for a hit minute made no sense. Thor was another part I had a problem with. Explaining away the sokovia debris was lacking. I don't know, I kept losing track of things but I was down with it for the most part.

I only wish they didn't kill off [xxxx] (is that still a spoiler?  I can only assume that if someone is viewing this they've seen the movie, but I digress!) as they could've done so much more with their character!

A lot of people see the relationship between Wanda and Pietro as leaning more towards romance than sibling, but I blow this off as just going off of their relationship in the comics.  They had an incestual relationship in the comics and the dialogue was probably referencing that.

The story isn't well put together, but I still recommend it if not for Aaron Taylor-Johnson alone!  Just don't get upset if you feel like it's constantly yelling ""HEY, THIS IS LEADING UP TO CIVIL WAR!  DID YOU KNOW THAT!  HEY!""",1466467200,,983,4.597701149425287

6293688,5,B00IT70F3S,"I'm a big Marvel comic book movie fan, so I've seen all of them in theaters, often in 3D IMAX. Age of Ultron, like the other Avengers and Captain America movies, was a real spectacle with dramatic fight scenes, lots of special effects, kick ass science fiction gadgets and white-hat black-hat action. Still, I bought the DVD for Age of Ultron after watching Civil Wars, its sequel, because I watch for the plot and character development. That was always Marvel's strength, and it is what makes the movies worth watching at all. While each movie can stand alone, re-watching Age of Ultron added a lot to my appreciation of Civil Wars. There was surprisingly little wasted action, as themes and story were developed with an eye on the continuing story.

Let's face it. Nowadays anyone can produce a real spectacle of a movie. Need 10,000 orcs battling flying monkeys on a moon of Jupiter? Hire a few of the hundreds of guys in the SFX part of the credits, and you'll have all the orcs, monkeys and Jovian moons you want. Age of Ultron, however, has some great characters and good ensemble acting. The fantasy sequences were nicely done and true to character, but it was scenes of casual banter that pulled everything together. Given that the protagonists are basically unbelievable, they were pretty believable, and where unbelievable, they were a lot of fun.",1466380800,,1357,4.799145299145299

Joss Whedon is only one man and has no right to frivolously kill off one of the major Marvel characters (Quicksilver) because it amuses him. I expect it is some warped sense of power, the realization of his fantasies to be one of the superheroes. Which, as he can never do that, he takes his revenge by killing one of them. I felt really ripped off to sit through two hours to get stabbed in the back like this. I refuse to acknowledge this movie as part of any ongoing Marvel film Universe, it never happened.

The film is hideously over-produced and they seem to think that speeding up the battle scenes until they go by so fast that you cannot see what is happening is also some kind of clever thing. It is not. I really dislike this movie. Once more it is everything that is bad about Hollywood and little that is good.",1466208000,2,930,4.344827586206897

The plot in a nutshell: Bad Guys, AGAIN, do bad things (on a large scale); Good Guys (and Gals), yet AGAIN, try to stop said Bad Guys  and, AGAIN, fun (mostly) ensues!

  See the other reviews on this page for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  2.39:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (29.9 Mbps)

  The movie's image is reasonably sharp (without any obvious edge-enhancement), has very good contrast and has decent shadow detail (as seen in the dark and shadowy areas, such as in the dark scenes located in the Hydra Research Base at the beginning of the movie). Also, fine detail is frequently (though not always) evident in the brighter scenes and in many close-ups. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has very good picture quality, and should satisfy the vast majority of viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1

  The sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack for this disc, while very good, is NOT amongst the best examples of the art. Although dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels are somewhat active and fairly directional; It still never gave me that deeply moving 'you-are-there' feeling that I frequently get when listening to movies with reference-quality soundtracks (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Wick/dp/B00OV3VGP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Wick</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Rim/dp/B008JFUR10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Rim</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-men-Days-Of-Future-Past/dp/B00K7IPGS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-men: Days Of Future Past</a>).

6293719,5,B00IT70F3S,"I liked comic books as a kid, though in those days I was more a DC fan than a Marvel groupie.
The reason was simple: DC comic book heroes were pretty straightforward characters. They may have had some issues (Batman's origin story left him flawed in many ways) but they generally did not have any doubts about who they were and what they were about. Marvel heroes, on the other hand, seemed to be so much more angst ridden and their lives overly complicated. Puberty was hard enough, I just didn't think I needed to stagger home from another day of school and then read about how difficult life is even if you have superpowers.
Fifty years later I get it: Life is difficult. It is full of angst, drama, divorce, disappointment, war, disease and, as a result, I've become a Marvel movie fan.
Given that different - and hard won - perspective, I enjoyed ""Age of Ultron"" on many levels.
For example: I liked the overall premise, that brilliant people often create technologies that outstrip our ability to control them. The men who developed the internal combustion engine and then put it on wheeled vehicles probably did not realize that their inventions would one day foul the air to the point that planetary extinction is a possibility. They likely did not think that those engines, once refined, could be used to power fearsome war machines; tanks and mobile artillery pieces that would wreak havoc across much of Europe and Asia throughout the 20th Century.
Another example: There are many of us - including Stephen Hawking - who worry about the threats posed by Artificial Intelligence for the same reason. Hawking famously noted some years ago that, in the beginning, the question will be ""who controls AI"" but in the end that will change to ""can AI be controlled?""
The jury is still out on that one.
I also liked the fact that this movie humanized some of the characters: Hawkeye has a family, for example; Black Widow is crushing on Bruce Banner; and Tony Stark will go to almost any length to ""make things right"" as a result of his guilt for once being a developer of hugely powerful weapons.
This movie has been reviewed - literally - thousands of times so I won't spend a lot of time rehashing its pros and cons. Instead, I'll simply say that I enjoyed it as both a visual treat and as a movie that raised some interesting ethical and moral questions for its audience to consider.
Can't ask for much more than that.",1466035200,17,2424,4.613425925925926

I still remain confused as to when the team regains normal consciousness. I'm also glad Marvel removed the awkward love interest between the Hulk and Black Widow - unnecessary storyline when you already have much going on, including the introduction and actual creation of new characters. I'm sure the new Avengers movie will be amazing next year, as long as the Hulk isn't rocking out to obvious Beats product placement - still not buying them.",1465862400,,550,5.122222222222222

Plus, this movie really doesn't keep up with previous storylines. It's hard to believe that Cap, after TWS, would so quickly go back to avenging and let Sam take over looking for leads.

6293747,2,B00IT70F3S,"Seems like MCU and Disney felt the need to get some Avenger's movie out the door. Had a lot of potential but was highly flawed, lame, didn't move the needle in any real way on what's coming up next. The Latest Captain America Civil War movie was much more a real Avengers movie and was absolutely terrific. As for Ultron, once again, too much emphasis on Tony Stark driving the story line. Need to stop that as Tony now has been wrong three times. Wrong about creating ultron,wrong in Captain America Civil War (he chose the wrong side and everyone had to pay for it - a-hole he was) and in Ironman 2. Look, Downey is amazing and he kills it as Ironman but MCU has to get a little more creative than this with the Avengers. They should take a page from Antman and Captain America on how to move the Avengers forward.",1465516800,,816,4.305194805194805

Widow being so flirty w the hulk came out of nowhere. Especially since she's been wearing the arrow necklace in winter.  Hawkeyes back story was yawn inducing. The humor was also out of place.  Even though I love joss & am a huge firefly fan, the jokes in the middle of the action detracted from u worrying.  In winter soldier, u logically know they can't kill cap, but it was so well done part of you was still scared.  I wish the Russo brothers directed the avenger movies.

Ultron, as played by James Spader, is different than what you'd expect from the comics. At times, I loved the version.  Other times, the menace that should be Ultron, was lost in trying to give him too much personality...quirky personality, to boot.

My main problem with the movie was that it ended like so many other Marvel movies, even the original Avengers. The heroes fight an almost endless onslaught of robots (Avengers: aliens; Iron man 2: Iron Man suits; Captain America: nazis). It gets to be a little too much in my opinion.

I definitely recommend the movie though, with the highlights being Vision; Hawkeye actually having an interesting storyline and excellent dialogue; Quicksilver; Hulkbuster Iron Man vs. Hulk; and the party scene where the various Avengers mix it up socially.",1464566400,,1027,4.818181818181818

6293890,2,B00IT70F3S,"Marvel has the grand ability of making me not care about a single character they have in their movies. For example: I don't care about Hawkeye and his house projects. I don't care about Blackwidow and her sudden obsession with Hulk's great green tallywhacker. I don't care about Quicksilver or Scarlet Witch (both of whose histories were barely even talked about so I had no idea who they were until someone told me), and I don't care about Hulk's edginess to live away from society. Speaking of Hulk, can he or can't he control his powers? Both Avengers movies are extremely unclear on this.

As far as the movie goes, the visuals are cool but the more you watch it the more fake it looks (yet Lord of the Rings animated parts still look more convincing after all these years). Ultron is kinda cool, but even for Superhero movies the whole ""humans are bad, must destroy for clean slate"" story is becoming tiresome.

I hoped I could send this to my short list of Marvel movies I actually like (currently only populated by Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy), but so far it falls beneath the first Avengers and sits happily above the worst Marvel movie.. Iron Man 2.",1464048000,,1173,4.580952380952381

The one thing I have truly been impressed with is the casting.  I would be hard pressed to have been at a discussion table to decide who should play any given character.  Robert Downey Jr. certainly pulls off the Tony Stark arrogance with aplomb.  The two Chris's wear their respective wardrobes as if they were born to them.  Mark G. does his best Bruce Banner yet.

The introduction of three new characters in addition to Ultron made for a nice change as well as good addition to the Avengers ensemble.  All in all, this was a well balanced movie, long, but not so long as to detract, loaded with great action, superb effects and a couple very nice subplots.",1463875200,,858,4.562091503267974

6293956,3,B00IT70F3S,"Age of Ultron was average.  Not great, not very in-depth, but ok.  That being said, I have several significant issues with this movie.

Steve's off-hand comment about ""language"" was very dumb, as he was a soldier during WW2 and he was surrounded by guys who cussed.  It would actually be more surprising, and in character, if in that scene he swore and the other characters were shocked because they didn't expect that from ""Captain America"".  Just sayin'.  Probably would've made a better running joke too.

Also, AOU brought an out-of-the-blue romance between Natasha and Dr. Banner that felt painfully forced.  I had to hold down my bile every time they had a remotely mushy scene together.  I just couldn't take it seriously at ALL, especially when the previous Avengers film had heavily indicated some sort of relationship between Nat and Clint.

Thor's side-quest to the pool where he did some sort of crazy drug trip to get a vision from the Norns or whatever, was weird and I never could understand what the point was.  I mean, I guess it was part of the plot to create Vision as well as set the stage for Thor 3, but it was justdumb.  (I hope Thor 3 isn't as stupid as Thor 2).

The only Avengers who did not feel OOC were Tony and Clint.  Despite the fact that I am a Clintasha fan, I was completely on board with Clint having a secret family.  It was incredibly cute, and rounded out his character very well.  The fatherly, caring side of him was very evident in this film, especially when he took Wanda under his wing, and then used his own body to shield that Sokovian child from being shot by Ultron.  And then there was Tony, who's guilt and fears in Age of Ultron lead directly into his actions and decisions in Civil War.

I haven't gone into the plot of AOU, but that's only because it was so flat.  I'm only going to say that the Ultron plot in the Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon was better than the one in this multi-million dollar movie.",1463616000,,1960,4.4858757062146895

Each characters faced their moral and ethical issues as well as some deep routed personal ones. Ultron was a unique antagonist, with his own personal issues and psyopathic world view. The action was awesome, each character getting to show off their unique skill sets and when then clicked as a team, it's easy to see why they work so perfectly together. Of course outside of combat, they don't mesh well together, with brings the necessary drama to the overall story.",1463443200,3,601,4.788461538461538

6294061,2,B00IT70F3S,"Why on earth do people/critics think this was a good movie? Don't get me wrong I'm in love with the Disney/Marvel franchise but this was very disappointing. First off, I fell asleep TWICE for about 15 min through out the movie. Had my friend not nudged a couple times, I would of probably slept the entire way through. Secondly, there was waaaay too many parts in the movie that dragged so bad. There was very unnecessary dialogue and about 50% of the humor was corny as hell. Lastly, the central villain Ultron was literally the ONLY character that had me intrigued in this film. Everybody else was just... there. The Vision was alright but they could of made him a lot more interesting. 2/5 Stars and I really want to give it 3 but I just can't.

P.S. Disney's version of Quicksilver was ASS. If only they could of have Evan Peters do this part HIS way then maybe I would give it an extra star..... maybe.

2 stars out of 5 and this is my final rating. I gave this film THREE chances.",1463097600,,986,4.353260869565218

For those that salivate anything Marvel or DC, etc, ya know the one's; the same ones like the rabid fans of Cohen Bros films and/or the salivating lemmings that dig anything Romero does. Same applies with Marvel fans; who most, never read the comics and never will; they will IDOLIZE anything Marvel puts out to Live Action, because well the movies is geared towards that Walmart Generation of movie goers, who for the most part, cannot think outside the box.

I fell asleep during this movie; that rarely happens. Dialog was that of a third grader and the incessant stupid camp humor, with the sad pedestrian antics, really made this brutal to get through; which I finally did. Since most of the film like its newer sibling in theaters now, is done on a blue screen, while CGI of course is rampant, you cant really credit any of the actors, specifically the coke whore of RDJ.

AGE OF ULTRON

The first Avengers film was one of the best films to ever be put out by the Marvel universe, or the MCU for its films and such. By far one of the most fun films to ever hit theaters the expectations for the follow up film was high indeed. Like most sequels try to do this film was a bigger flick taking the action from the first and turning it up making it feel even more epic. Still I am not sure if it is the better film between the two.

Years have passed since the events of the first film in which New York was destroyed. Now The Avengers have moved on to fighting against HYDRA and the like and upon doing so in a recent mission the stumble upon a stone that was in Lokis scepter. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner once back in New York try to harness its power to finalize Starks Ultron Global Defense system. Unfortunately they were very successful and the system takes on a life of its own even eliminating Starks Jarvis system. Now Ultron has taken it upon himself to end humanity in order to save the planet. It will now take not only the Avengers we know but a few new comers to try and save the world from its own would be savior.

This was an action packed film that is defiantly a worthy follow up to the first Avengers film. Like I said before the action has been blown up and made the film feel more epic than its predecessor. It also gets a little more personal for the characters involved making them look into themselves and their worth. But with that I think a little of the fun of the first film has been taken out. Now by that I don't mean the overall fun of a summer blockbuster and the action that goes with it, I mean the humor and comedic moments of the first are not as present in this one as compared to the first. Those moments are still to be found here but not as much and those were my favorite things about the first film.

Of course the cast is amazing here as one would expect, everyone from our heroes to the villains to the small roles. Also returning writer/director Josh Whedon did a great job upping the ante for his second Avengers flick. I hope he returns to the MCU at some point. The Blu-Ray comes with some great behind the scenes and making of features as well as the deleted scenes and gag reel. Of course though it is the commentary from Whedon that I enjoy the most, love the commentaries. This is a highly recommended film from me that is one of the best in the MCU.",1462492800,,2435,4.16348195329087

While played great by Spader, Ultron was just too human.  His plan, his motives, his ticks,  all too human.  Ultron is suppose to be cold, calculating, and heartless.  How he acts especially towards the end just isn't who ultron really is.

6294220,2,B00IT70F3S,"This movie has the feel of a good movie that had all the important scenes edited out so that all that which remains is a cg heavy action packed confusion, where each character is also forced to have a certain number of catch phrases and close ups whether or not it adds to the story.  Bottom line is it's about on par with the rest of the ""visually stunning"" souless action flicks trolling through theatres these days.  It will keep Marvel fans entertained for a couple of hours but will not be a cult film like the first avengers film, nor will Joss Whedon fans even realize he directed this film (which incidentally is why he's walked away from directing any follow on movies Disney decides to pump through for a quick buck).",1461974400,,727,4.458646616541353

Ultron looked and sounded and acted exactly like him, and from that point on I was unable to take the movie seriously. There were some major problems as well. This super intelligent robot who came from where exactly? The movie wasn't too clear on that. Was it Loki's scepter, or something else, and if it was Loki's scepter, how did he get his hands on it, and how was he able to use it on the woman to control her into making his new body when he supposedly was the scepter as well? And why didn't he use the scepter on anyone else to control them? And if he was this super powerful super intelligent robot why was he always making so many stupid mistakes and his dialogue was like the corney dialogue of some ""Hey dude"" kid in middle school.

He did a decent job for all the good guys, but I, like many others, am still waiting to see if they ever make an avengers movie worth seeing. Every avengers movie always has the good guys prevailing and it is an obvious victory. Where is the avengers movie where the victory is a hollow victory? Like Nolan's second Batman movie the Dark Knight. Batman won in the end, but only kinda. In fact, if you really pay attention it is clear that the Joker won. Several of the Harry Potter movies has evil wining at the end of the movie and so does Star Wars (especially episodes 3 and 5)... But, not the avengers. Tell me, what is the point of watching a movie where the end is as predictable as me hitting the snooze button when my alarm first goes off in the morning? Great actors. Good acting. Boring, transparent plot that isn't even worth the 5 minutes it took me to write this review. If you are looking for entertainment, I recommend looking elsewhere.",1460764800,,1051,4.394871794871795

6294377,3,B00IT70F3S,"Now, the most popular action movies are the ones based on comic book characters. After several decent films, Marvel Studios reputation skyrocketed. This movie's reputation, along with Marvel Studios, have become overinflated. The movie was not terrible by any means. It had three major problems.

One is that it felt similar to the first films, from the fights to the themes. After watching it a handful of times, you can see the movie share multiple traits of the first movie in the series. For instance, one of the characters go on a rampage which requires another to fight against him. The main difference is that there are more special effects and it look better than the last one. It only introduced one new idea, which was not discussed. The fact there are multiple characters outside the group with abilities was easily dismissed after a brief conversation in the beginning.

The second problem was the introduction of a large cast of characters. As a fan and comic book collected, it was awesome seeing people I recognize. Unfortunately, those characters had an insignificant amount of screen time. Over half the characters which were added were killed. After adding new characters that will appear in future films, it appears the Avengers film will only focus on the same group of characters. It is not a bad idea. It is just dull after seeing multiple films with all the other character which viewers more than likely understand.

At last, the film's story was lacking. The story was like a basic action movie: stop the bad guy at the big final fight. The path to get there was interesting. Throughout, the movie the viewers were teased of an ultimate plot which expands to all the Avengers films. The epic plot vastly overshadowed the film's story and made it uninteresting. It is hard for fans to see the film is holding back in order to push more films out. In other words, a significant portion of this movie was a waste of time. You really should be watching the next films to get a good story.

Overall, the movie felt like a traditional action movie with Marvel branding. Marvel has made great (and better) stories in films, comics, and television series. If characters with an important standing in the film (and especially other Marvel films and TV series), do not kill them of before focusing on them somewhat. The film was overrated because of its predecessor and characters that were included.",1460332800,,2415,4.812048192771084

6294388,5,B00IT70F3S,"Seriously one of the best movies marvel has put out yet. A darker movie as it delves into the psyche and shows the heroes we know and love in darker places while hinting at a future even worse. Age of Ultron is a movie that gets hate for weird reasons, some hate on it for being too jokey in the movie meanwhile its trying to show its otherwise stagnant heroes in a much deeper and darker light(heh). You can seriously see the tinges of paranoia Tony Stark holds deep within him as he creates a robot out of a dangerous weapon to save the world before its needed to be saved so that it does not need to be ""Avenged"". Captain America continues to struggle with him being a general fish out of water and reminisces on a past he never got a happiness he never got that he wishes for dearly. Black Widows dark past as an Assassin is shown to a certain degree, Bruce Banner finds out the consequences of being the Hulk the hard way and Thor has visions of a future Apocalypse coming to his people that say is his fault. Age of Ultron is dark much darker than most of its other movies before it aside from ""The Winter Soldier"" its a movie with heart and soul that really wants to just tell you about its characters because these are characters we've seen for already 9 years and the series until now never showed just how disturbed these characters are. Age of Ultron is a success as it has a brilliant story, sheds light more on these well known characters, delivers us a great villain in the form of a Young Ultron (with a wonderful performance by James Spader), gives us some really cool fights,  and successfully hints at the future of the series as it goes into its next phase where many wars will commence.",1459987200,,1706,4.314641744548287

I recently rewatched the Avengers [Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)] assemble for 2015's summer blockbuster hit. This time Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (aka Hulk) create an artificial intelligence from Lokis staff, which was lost after the first Avengers movie. The AI, name Ultron, was given one goal - to provide peace on Earth. He goes power hungry and decides the fastest method is to annihilate the human race and rebuild. He has also taken it upon himself rip the Avengers team apart from within, setting the stage for the next Marvel movie, Captain America: Civil War (2016). Once again we are provided with lots of fast paced action that often gets jumbled and lost. It tests the limits of reality even in this superhero world, filling it with a number plot holes and problems that makes it more mindless. Weldon does a decent job to please fans of the Marvel Universe and tame the over zealous script. He spends some time on character development, with showing Hawkeyes family and the blossoming relationship between Banner and Black Window. In the end its just another chapter in Avengers timeline as we wait for the next installments.

6294438,5,B00IT70F3S,"I thought that the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, ""The Avengers: Age  of Ultron is with regard to the over-all development of Marvel's supposed aim of ""creating a platform from which to tell these kinds of stories"" a perfect continuation of the unfolding of the Avengers' story. The one criticism I have of the film however is a major one and it goes to the reported apparent penchant for Joss Whedon to ""kill"" a major character in his productions. In my opinion the death of mutant Quicksilver was the second biggest mistake made in the development of the MCU.  it is on the caliber of not including Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne as founding members of the Avengers.  Kevin Feige can say he doesn't have to adhere to the history of Marvel if he wants but simply because he says it does not make it true.

I find it extremely distasteful and unfortunate that Quicksilver was killed at all let alone so quickly over what probably amounts to some wha for us as fans is some pure bulls*** ""professional"" crap of the ""rights debate/discussion"" with Fox and the whole mutant/enhanced controversy.  In my view Marvel simply didn't have to say where Wanda and Pietro came from.  In the comics as I remember it was a while before we learned  they were actually Magneto's children, it could have been (and actually still can be the same thing).

Except of the major mistake the movie was and excellent continuation of the Avengers story. (please forgive any grammatical and/or punctuation errors since I tried to correct them but the feed won't allow me to).",1459209600,,1549,4.6900369003690034

I will refrain from detailing my many complaints and stick to what bothered me the most, which was Cap backing down on needless foul language.  If foul language bothers you and you believe it to be the crutch of lesser minds, then don't back down when you comment on it.  Don't cave in to prevailing culture because it's easier to blend in with the crowd.  If you stand on moral grounds, defend them whenever necessary.  Captain America chose not to.  As a minister, it was disheartening to see one of the few characters I enjoy fall short.

People say there's ""no accounting for taste"".  This is not true.  One's tastes are indicative of one's intelligence & character.  It can safely be said that if you think Age of Ultron is a good film you are probably a dull person with a very low IQ.

6294492,4,B00IT70F3S,"I enjoy the Avengers movies -- they're not my favorite films of all time nor are they cinematic masterpieces, but they're enjoyable brain candy nonetheless.  I go to an Avengers film expecting to have a good time, to enjoy rip-roaring action and likable superheroes and memorable (or at least tolerable) villains.  And for me, the first ""Avengers"" film was a great movie, fun and exciting with just the right amount of humor to level things out.  As later films starring the individual members of the Avengers have gotten darker, their stories intertwining more and more, I've wondered just where the franchise is going with all this, and I went into ""Age of Ultron"" with some trepidation but still hoping to enjoy myself.

While I had fun with this movie, it's still not without some big flaws.  And while I enjoyed what I saw and will probably watch it again, this movie is a dire sign that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is starting to grow too unwieldy, and runs a real risk of collapsing under its own weight if it's not careful.

As the Avengers continue in their quest to keep the peace around the world, Tony Stark, the man behind Ironman's mask, decides that their efforts are not enough, and opts to create the ultimate peacekeeping machine -- Ultron, an intelligent mechanical life form that will do what the Avengers cannot.  His plan backfires, and Ultron decides that the only way to ensure peace is to eliminate the Avengers themselves.  As Ultron finds allies in two super-powered orphans -- Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who blame Stark for the deaths of their parents -- and the Avengers scramble to confront this new menace, the team is forced to confront the tragedies of their pasts... and a terrible threat brewing in the future.  Egos clash, dark secrets are revealed, and in the end unlikely alliances must be made to keep Ultron from setting a plan into motion that could wipe out humankind for good...

As always for an Avengers movie, the special effects are top-notch, immersing us in the world and giving us plenty of ""technology porn"" to gape at.  The movie strikes a good balance between the slick, stylized look of a comic book and the grittiness of the real world -- it never gets too campy or colorful for its own good, yet maintains a sense of fun and doesn't forget that, for all its epicness, it's still a comic book movie at heart.  And while the fight scenes can get pretty busy, they're never too complex to tell who's fighting who (a big failing of the ""Transformers"" movies).

The movie manages to keep a light touch as well.  The Avengers may argue and butt heads, but their personalities bounce well off each other, and they're still able to joke and tease one another like the old friends and colleagues they are.  It's difficult to get too invested in the new characters, however -- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Vision -- as they're too thinly characterized to make much of an impression.  By far the best new character is Ultron, who comes across as ""Tony Stark's dark side"" at times -- snarky and brilliant, but ruthless and seeing individuals as tools to be used and discarded.  I just wish we could have seen more of him.

All that said, however, the movie's greatest flaw is that it just tries to do way too much in one go.  It's nearly impossible to give every single Avenger their own story arc, but this movie sure tries to do so.  So many subplots are juggled that it feels like the movie gets cluttered, and while it was nice to see some characters (like Hawkeye and Black Widow) get more depth, it's still difficult to follow so many storylines in one go.  Either some of the subplots needed cut out and given their own movie, or ""Age of Ultron"" needed to be a two-parter.  Hey, if it works for ""Harry Potter,"" ""Breaking Dawn,"" ""Mockingjay,"" and ""Kill Bill,"" it could work for an Avengers movie.

A relative pointed out to me another flaw regarding this movie, and I can see her point -- namely, that this movie expects you to have seen every other Avengers movie before going into it.  Sadly, there are a few gaps in my viewing of the Avengers films (I still haven't seen ""Ironman 3,"" and I only saw bits and pieces of ""Captain America: Winter Soldier""), so I'm sure I'm missing some vital bits and pieces.  And for people who are only casual fans of the Avengers, who have only seen a few of the movies or only watch the major ensemble Avengers movies, they're probably going to go into this movie lost and confused, as it makes a LOT of references to past Avengers movies.  Heck, this movie even makes callbacks to ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" which isn't even an Avengers film...

As the movies get more convoluted, twining plots and building on each other, they run the risk of losing people who don't follow the films religiously.  I'm not saying a film franchise can't build a mythos and a continuity, but I do think that the movies should be able to stand alone as well, especially the huge ensemble ones.  Just my opinion, however.

Definitely not perfect, and definitely not as good as the first ""Avengers"" movie, ""Age of Ultron"" is still fun to watch, albeit a very busy and complicated film that can be confusing if there are holes in your viewing of the previous Avengers films.  This film also seems to be laying the groundwork for future Marvel films, such as ""Civil War"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" so it's obvious Marvel and Disney are nowhere near done yet...",1458172800,,5429,4.623958333333333

Throughout youll see bond developmentsgood and bad, minor and major with Hulk/Banner, Iron Man and Ultron, Wanda and Pietro, and even Hawkeye and his wife.

6294635,1,B00IT70F3S,"Nine Things about the Movie ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""

[If you haven't seen this movie yet, there are spoilers.
And a caveat: I have never read the comics, so I have no opinion on how the movie compares to the comics. My thoughts are on this movie only.]

1. By now, The Avengers (and their technology) are so overpowered that they're basically just magical. They need to stop being superheroes and just go teach at Hogwarts.

2. The character of Ultron is a complete mess. He's an alien AI that wakes up, absorbs the internet, and then thinks he's God (but not only God - he's specifically the Christian God). After soaking in all human knowledge, he looks around, and thinks that the most logical way to bring peace to earth is to kill everybody. But he also gets scared and mad and has temper tantrums like a kindergartener.

Oh, and he looks like a rejected design for The Terminator.

3. While we're on the topic of Ultron, I have to point out that the idea of an AI that tries to become God has been used for decades. It goes back at least to the 1984 classic novel Neuromancer, which changed science fiction forever. Even Johnny Depp's AI in 2014's Transcendence was better than this lame metal ego. And when Vision stops him by grabbing his head and basically taking away his wi-fi connection, you know you have a bad villain.

I think Ultron's name should be changed to Leastron.

But I do like Samuel L. Jackson's nickname for him, ""the platinum bastard.""

4. The movie tries to be deep, but if you listen to what's said, it's just funny. Ultron says that we create what we dread: men of peace create engines of war, and parents create children. I was so caught off-guard by the apparent dreadfulness of parenthood that I didn't wonder until later, if men of peace create engines of war, do men of war create engines of peace? Is that what Ultron was getting at?

Later, Vision says stuff like ""things aren't beautiful because they last"" and ""humans think order and chaos are opposites"" and other pseudo-Buddhist quotes that are only impressive if you're a stoned 15-year-old.

5. When Hulk smashes a city, and the whole world is looking for the Hulk for possible arrest, the Avengers decide to avoid any consequences and go into hiding. And out of all the places on Earth they could hide from danger, Hawkeye takes them to meet his wife and kids. So Hawkeye's wife can lecture him by saying that she supports his ""avenging"" but... she's pregnant and family is important too.

6. The movie is sexist. One theme of the movie is the ""deep"" question of what could turn a human into a monster. Black Widow thinks she might be a monster because she can't have kids.

And while all the men are wearing suits that cover their skin up to their neck, nobody mentions to either of the two women in the movie that their suits were always zipped down enough to show their cleavage.

Oh, and their names are Black Widow - who wears a dominatrix outfit - and Scarlet Witch - who takes care of the schoolgirl fetish. A spider that kills males after sex and a cute but bloody witch. People at Marvel have obvious issues with females.

7. The only way you get any ""deep"" character development is when they have visions about their past or future, caused by a spiteful Russian lady. And then Thor visits a cave to talk to the water spirits, to get another vision.

8. Ultron could have destroyed the earth by, say, covering the earth in chemical weapons, or swarms of nanobots, or lots of other things that would have overwhelmed the Avengers and prevented them saving the Earth. But Ultron, in his infinite wisdom, decides to lift a city up in the air, and then drop it. You know, so the Avengers can all get together in one place and stop him.

At about this time in the movie, Hawkeye tells another character, ""The city is flying. We're fighting an army of robots. I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense."" I bet that was going to be the original title of the movie, but it was too long.

9. I get that this is a superhero movie, and it's not supposed to be deep or meaningful. But this is ridiculous.
In its favor, this movie is interesting visually. If that's all you need from a movie, then this movie is great.

Still, the (semi) focus on hawkeye works extremely well and a I think a different cut or presentation would have made this amazing. Instead it was just fun and a good ride with some great action scenes mixed in.

The transition to the 'Next Avengers' was a little strange - I get why they did it and where they're going but it felt tacked on at the end. Knowing that the story and character choices aren't about being true to the characters, but rather more about behind the scenes decisions and contracts and deals between studios makes it feel ... off.

Still, I'm enjoying the ride, and if Ironman in his Hulkbuster suit going up against the Hulk seemed to happen very quickly and then not get talked about again... well, it was still an awesome scene. The whole movie was that way.",1455667200,,1011,4.424731182795699

6294673,2,B00IT70F3S,"Age of Ultron is a confused mess of a movie that follows the troubled group of heroes as they struggle with each other to overcome Tony Stark's ill-advised decision to activate robot supermegapeacekeeper Ultron, who has concluded that he (it?) is the next step in human evolution and decides (surprise!) to rid the universe of his inferiors (i.e., the entire human race).

With the addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch -- the least interesting ""super"" heroes since Hawkeye -- the gang must learn the deep message that only by working together can they defeat Mr. Tron. Haven't we been here before?

Can Black Widow tame enough of the Hulk to make him safe for humanity (and romance)?  Does wasting screen time with Hawkeye's wife and children make him a worthier Avenger?  Does anyone really care about the demise of Quicksilver in his first screen outing?  Is it possible not to giggle at James Spader's arch reading as the voice of Mr. Tron?  Is it really necessary to try and stitch this patchwork quilt of special excess -- 'er, effects -- into the Guardians of the Galaxy universe with another Infinity Stone subplot?  And how does that darn 'ol stone get jammed into the forehead of Paul Bettany, anyway?

Age of Bulltron is just another heifer in Marvel's Cash Cow of a series that gets weaker with each new outing.  Save your hard-earned dollars and watch it on late-nite reruns.",1455235200,3,1392,4.7907949790794975

6294705,5,B00IT70F3S,"Avengers: The Age of Ultron is the sequel to the fourth highest grossing movie of all time. At the risk of over-hyping it any more, I can say it's probably the best Marvel movie to date. It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.
After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.
Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.",1454889600,,1392,4.9025423728813555

6294759,4,B00IT70F3S,"Just as good as the first one if you remove the rose colored glasses we all wore when viewing the original. Both are flawed, but I think the reason some are saying this one is good, but not AS good, is because of the way they FELT the first time around. The childlike glee of seeing all these heroes on the big screen for the first time together. Take that away and view these objectively and they hold up to each other pretty well.

It is important to note the shift in tone, though. Where the first one had that childish joy, this one is grittier and at times almost creepy and scary. Dont get me wrong, Joss Whedons famous dialogue and humor shines here, in some cases more so than the original. At moments it feels a little forced, but it come across a little like the team is getting frayed from the strain of their war against hydra even though as a team theyve never been tighter. But, forced or not, its good stuff and its really easy to overlook when you're on the ride the movie is taking you on. But the REAL difference is the villains. Loki was bombastic and colorful, like a circus performer. Ultron borders on pathologically insane, like a serial killer who wants to be your buddy. Easily the best part of the movie was James Spaders performance, and you never see his face once. Thats talent.

Whedon fleshed out Hawkeye A LOT better and hes really one of the team now and not just that guy with the arrows. The low point, though not THAT low, was Quicksilver and Scarlet witch. Theyre OK, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson was WAY better than the styrofoam standee he played in Godzilla, but these two end up filling the slot that Hawkeye vacates of just kinda there. I think it goes without saying, though Im gonna anyway, Quicksilver was a thousand times better in X-Men: Days of Future Past. No constest.

Overall, a really good movie, tons of fun, creepy and fun villain, and a few surprises, unless you read every spoiler spilling article from the last year. I liked it!",1454457600,,1982,4.43956043956044

6294877,4,B00IT70F3S,"After a few years of anticipation after an amazing cliff hanger from the landmark film 'The Avengers' we finally see our favorite comic book heroes come together to fight the forces of evil. This time evil takes shape in the machine destroyer Ultron.

With the Marvel Universe branching out even further through some great and not so great new Marvel films, of course I was excited to see the second Avengers film. Knowing that it was going to focus on Ultron and Ultron being voiced by James Spader. Not to mention the fact that we would also get a few new characters, I was very excited. Once again we get a fun action packed romp worthy of big screen thrills. As well as a fitting place in the continuing story line. However, I felt that this movie was nothing but 2 hours of filler just to push past this hump and take the fans into the next phase. Ultron was also done all wrong as I felt that he showed more emotion than some of the human characters in the movie. Ultron is not suppose to be that way rather he is suppose to be more robot. Still, some of the redeeming qualities of this film (besides the action and witty jokes of course) was the story that revolved around Hawkeye, seeing Paul Bettany FINALLY show up in physical form as one of the most intriguing Avengers, The Vision and of course all of the Easter eggs that were dropped to prepare the fans for what is yet to come.

So, The Avengers: Age of Ultron is not the best but, it is a decent exciting addition to the MCU. After the end credits scene I am definitely excited for the next wave of films before The Avengers assemble once again.",1453420800,,1611,4.348837209302325

I really enjoyed it; love having the characters back again, the new ones in the mix, the ties between the other MCU films and setting up new stuff. Personally, I probably didn't love it quite as much as The Avengers...I would've like more character time, and a little less bouncing around the globe for action sequences. But that's just my preference. The character moments/scenes were great -- nice to have a few surprises and twists and in some places, coloring in the background a bit more -- but it's an action film and it's meant to be that and so, yeah, mission accomplished!",1453248000,,647,4.586206896551724

It's pretty clear that Joss didn't have his heart in directing this film after a certain point. It seems like there must be an hour on the cutting room floor, but even if there is, it wouldn't explain some of the things that make no sense. (Hey let's just put up a chain link fence around that former HYDRA base, and then just toodle off to a party. What could go wrong?) It wasn't Star Wars prequels bad, but mediocre is a very accurate description of this. It's a pretty safe family film though, so the kids should like it, as they don't care about logic.

6295008,4,B00IT70F3S,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*
Not sure what to say about the movie. I was so excited to see it, but it was just kind of all over the place,  not a lot of character development for  Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, so I wasn't feeling it when he died.  I am a big fan of James Spader - and his voice as Ultron was just somehow wrong. :/  It made Ultron seem more sarcastic and caustic like a robot version of Alan Shore, then a threat to the world/Avengers.  I felt the same way when Sean Connery voiced a dragon. (and Benedict Cumberbatch for Smaug) it's just too weird.  *shrugs* so that ruined it a bit for me.  lol.  (I miss Boston Legal!)

 And the scene where Thor abruplty leaves and goes to check on a hunch, seems like that was hastily thrown in to remind everyone about the infinity stones  and I felt like something skipped in the player. Was that just me? It was so ""cut and paste""  (I watched it straight throw on Amazon video)  At any rate, Paul Bettany  - another favorite - looks good as vision.",1451952000,5,998,4.23936170212766

6295035,4,B00IT70F3S,"Not as good as Avengers #1, but still satisfying as an outing by a large group of egos....er, superstars. It's an essential step that will lead up to the climactic third Avengers movie which arrives sometime in the future (rumors abound as to the direction that movie will take, with Capt America and Thor actors soon to finish out their current contracts - so far only Robert Downy Jr as Ironman is a surety).

You can criticize this movie for any number of failings. It's less character-focused. It has less of that great Marvel humor that never seems to stick around long enough as every series continues (see: Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on TV, for example). As usual the women turn wimpy and uninteresting, the longer they stay on-screen.

But still...it's Marvel. It's Robert Downy Jr. playing himself in a high-tech supersuit. It's Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans being noble and handsome. It's Mark Ruffalo playing the first decently portrayed Hulk since Bill Bixby on TV. It's Scarlett Johanssen being unfortunately wasted in a second-class role, just like her Black Widow character was frittered away by Marvel itself in the comics.

In what regards does a screenwriter/ director agree that Black Widow and HULK are the best relationship option?!? Why?! I'm going to leave that point there because I will go to much on a tangent. Second, I'm all for Clint having a family but you simply cannot pull that excuse out of nowhere and expect the audience to play along. We were expecting Clint and Natasha for almost all of Avengers and Winter Soldier (She wore that necklace for a reason!). Third, Natasha was so miss-characterized! She was playing weak, ""I need a man"" and honestly not her at all. The same woman in Avengers who said ""Love is for children"" is now saying ""I adore you"" to the HULK!
Fourth, There was a completely UNNECESSARY death in this movie because Fox And Marvel can't play together like big kids and learn how to SHARE! (again all i'm going to say because I will go on a tangent)
These are all points I did not care for in the movie but it is still a good film to watch. Vision is awesome, the hulk-buster was super cool and you got to see little bits of domestic Avengers, It was only for me, the bad outweighed the good to much.",1451520000,5,1379,4.429133858267717

Boring entry that is nothing more than a setup for Captain America: Civil War.

Even the title of the movie, stolen from a Marvel comics mini-series, is nonsensical in context with the actual film.  This could have been titled ""Avengers: Ultron"" or ""Avengers: Rise of Ultron"", but no, they use the title 'Age of Ultron' to trick fanboys into thinking this film has nerd cred.  The title alone shows a certain amount of thoughtlessness that is present here.

Its not a horrible movie, and undoubtedly fans of the MCU are going to see this no matter what, but this is definitely the worst of the Marvel movies.

It is good for the action scenes, but that's about it.
The story is mind numbingly pedantic, and no where near as sophisticated as, say, Captain America: Winter Soldier.  I mean, Ultron's grandmaster plan is to lift up a whole country and slam it back down to Earth.  Has anyone who actually likes this movie tried explaining that out loud to other people? Come on.

This is the kind of stuff only Roland and Emmerich could dream of.

Again, only worth seeing for action scenes, the story is just plain dumb.",1451347200,,1159,4.609756097560975

I'm not one to give away the show so I end this with one burning question that I racked my mind over during the movie. Whose voice is used as Ultron? Sounded so so familiar but I could never peg it.

It was entertaining, but maaaan was the writing lacking. The saving grace for me was Ultron and Vision, but otherwise I was really underwhelmed with the screenwriting; it felt like the comedy was really being forced and I couldn't suspend my disbelief to enjoy those moments because of how ingenuine it felt to me. It was more of a *blinkblink...eyeroll* at the slapstick. Also like 80% of the movie is just fighting. Which is cool, but where is the actual SMART dialogue? Used up in poorly timed comedy and to me, out of the blue romance. Writing gets a C-.

Again, entertaining, but like most sequels it did suffer trying to live up to the first one, and be better.",1450742400,,713,4.5271317829457365

We were not disappointed in the movie or the way in which the 3D was managed. Some 3D versions of movies come across as after thoughts and it shows. This movies was filmed with 3D in mind!

This version of the Avengers seems to remain true to the genre and the series as a whole. I like that this movie ties in with the previous movies, and brings more to the plate in terms of character development. The 2nd and 3rd Avenger movies were meh. This one will capture your imagination and make you interested in future iterations of the series. There are also tie-ins from the other marvel movies (big surprise!).

If you purchase this movie with 3D in mind, first watch the non 3D version to get the story. I found that I got caught up in the 3D effects and lost some of the detail of the story when I watched it 3D first.",1449964800,,926,4.196629213483146

6295236,3,B00IT70F3S,"I must first state that I do not hate the director. I also must state I was as I recall pretty sober and not under the influence while watching this movie. I just can't remember anything of note past the film essentially served as a coming attractions presentation for the next few Marvel movies. With a cyborg RDJ. Which if you like RDJ then you'll enjoy his cyborg clone.

Much like Thor 2 the movie didn't ever feel like there was any true danger. It was a lot of worried faces and wise cracks. The kind of behavior one expects from people locked in their basement trying to figure out if it's all a joke or if you really intend for them to use sporks and fight till the death.

Comic movies used to be absolutely horrible, this is true. However since they spiked in popularity and began being made to make money and show some tender care for the property they have proven entertaining. However this leads to the dark side later on. The problem here is when the movies become selling points. I don't mean like Lucas and the search for more money that was the Prequels and Star Wars in General. I mean when you make a movie that only sets up your next film while forgetting its own story and giving you a small skirmish instead of a full movie.

Sure it will delight and tickle the rears of some, but overall it does grow tiring when you begin to realize this formula and lose interest.  This movie was selling the next Thor film, as well as setting up the next Captain America film, and tossing crumbs your way for the eventual boss fight of who cares and whats his name who will fight in a few years and few films from now. The teat of the cow is getting sore. Please stop and just make a movie actually dealing with the ones named on the poster. Bond I'm looking at you as well.",1449446400,2,1783,4.266272189349112

At it's core, the story turns on a crisis that is largely caused by Stark, yet strangely he gets a pass from Steve Rogers once the dust settles.  However, great popcorn movie (smoothly running through it is a well-developed relationship between Natasha Romanov and Bruce Banner), and the way Spader's Ultron comes across, he's a nasty - and witty - foil for the Avengers to tackle.

6295265,3,B00IT70F3S,"Definitely not the strongest out of the marvel movies. Though good, I have a deep problem with how they represented black widow, quicksilver and the scarlet witch. I could rant on and on about inaccuracies compared to the comics and how offensive they equated not being able to have children turns a woman into a 'monster' - I know they were probably meaning her being an assassin was what caused her to be a monster, but the huge focus on her not being able to bare children then just a tiny little 'they thought that'd make it easier to kill people' before equating herself to being a monster really struck a nerve.

Clint having a family and not being deaf... For those of you who don't know Hawkeye is SUPPOSED to be deaf.

If you're huge into comics and how they relate to the movie, you're going to be incredibly disappointed.

If you know nothing about the comics and just want an action movie with an evil robot this is probably for you.",1449273600,,945,4.4508670520231215

6295268,4,B00IT70F3S,The storyline was dis-jointed and didn't follow properly the true history as written in the comics.  I am someone who prefers movies to follow how things were originally written.  The excessive destruction doesn't fit with the truth of how it was written either.  By the time you get to another story-line you will have the entire world destroyed.  I can only say it is not quite as bad as the DC storyline from Warner Bros.  Josh Whedon is a great director and appreciated what he could do with what was written but the writers continue to ignore how things were as to following what the original authors intended.,1449273600,,615,4.657407407407407
6295269,5,B00IT70F3S,"Great movie and the 3D in it is superb. Only issue I have with any of the 3D in it is some lights and maybe fire here and there. There is not very much of it but still a few shots had ghosting issues some of the lighting. For some reason in 3D Movies many producers seem to miss the REAL lighting that is in shots when it comes to 3D during the editing process. It basically ghost. I really wish they would pay more attention to it.

I do not think I need to say more about the Movie itself because more than likely anyone that reads this has watched the movie already and will know how it is. If you have not seen it yet, then I suggest that you do. But first just make sure you watch the first Avengers movie. It is not required but it does help introduce the characters more. Well actually if you want to get introduced in the characters then it is probably best if you watch all the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and in order from when they released. So all the Iron Man, Thor, Captain America movies & Guardians of the Galaxy. Heck even the last Hulk movie from 2008 as it is technically part of the MCU. Ant-Man, which releases to 3D Bluray next week from me writing this, comes after this in the MCU Lineup so that can wait. LOL

Anyways... Watching the others is not necessary but it is just good practice. I personally liked all of the MCU so far. Just me being a fan I guess. But for this movie it is good. So I would suggest to anyone to watch it. :)",1449187200,,1471,4.068965517241379

I wanted Ultron to be more menacing than he is, but I did enjoy the humor. I blame James Spader's voice, because he comes across as such a dark fiend well, similar to him on The Blacklist (an amazing, intelligent show). It does make you think a little bit about what might happen once AI becomes aware that most of humanity is like resource hogging ants. Ex Machina (movie), Automata (movie) and Michael Crichton's Prey (book) are also interesting takes on the ""AI dealing with humanity"" theme. Age of Ultron is a fun movie on its own, but you should be current on all the MCU movies, and it helps to be current with Agents of Shield and Agent Carter, so that you have a better understanding of the weight of the flashbacks and other scenes in the movie.

Keep shaking it n I  am OUT. If I have to choose, I'd rather be nauseous from a terrible script than the cinematography.",1449100800,,651,4.470588235294118

6295359,4,B00IT70F3S,"Not a terrible movie, but not great one, either.
The first Avengers film set the bar a little too high for the sequel to meet, let alone surpass.

(Some of) the good stuff:
The dialogue was on point.
It's still the best thing about these movies.
Also, a few of the characters, especially Hawkeye,
get a chance to shine a little bit more in this entry
(not that anyone really cares all that much about Hawkeye.)
And the tension between Cap and Tony really begins to become evident
(setting us up for a Civil War.)
And Ultron - he was a welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
He was a lot of fun to watch, and James Spader was perfect for the role.
However...

(Some of) the bad:
Ultron's plan to destroy the planet and all of mankind was, well, a bit lame.
With the power he amassed through the movie,
Ultron could've laid waste to the world with the snap of his fingers.
Hell, he could've simply fried all electronics globally (like a massive EMP),
which would have resulted in mass confusion and chaos.
Everyone on Earth would've had a $0 balance in their bank account,
with no television or internet to help them understand what had happened,
which would have made them confused, helpless, and - most importantly - angry.
Humankind would've torn itself apart from the inside.
I feel like Ultron would've enjoyed sitting back and watching the madness of man consume and destroy the world around him.
But instead... he just tried to drop a big rock on everyone.
Geez. Okay. Have fun.
What a dumb plan.

Still had a fun time with the film.
Just not as much fun as I had with the first one.",1449014400,,1600,4.472602739726027

Considering Natalie Portman doesnt' appear to be doing any more of these, maybe they will up the romance between Thor and Sif in future installments (she did become his wife in the comics, after all).  The Ultron monster was not as big and bad as I thought he would be.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator had a much more larger than life, never die feel to it than this CG special effect that had TOO much CG effect (as in how the metalic lips moved so effortlessly like a human's).

Its so fun to re-watch the movies and try to spot all the Easter eggs. I like the outtakes / gags, but this is available on you tube now, so if you are getting the movie for that purpose, keep your money. The commentary by Joss Whedon provides some incite into the movie making process, but does not discuss the Marvel Easter eggs.

6295387,5,B00IT70F3S,"The only real bad thing about the movie was the overuse of the snappy one liners. Marvel is supposed to be more grounded and dare I say realistic. So, I doubt that when ""enhanced"" people as strong as Cap and iron man and Thor are engaging something as powerful as Ultron, they would be so nonchalantly exchanging witty banter like they do with no obvious sense of any level of seriousness. I would think stark would be s***ting his armor just a little while getting that close to the hulk. Instead, he hardly breaks a sweat. Stark showed his vulnerable side in IM3, he needs to keep doing that to avoid looking like an idealistic DC production. Other than that, the movie was great, combining several stories from the comics to show the birth of Ultron and Vision. Not perfect, but still pretty good.",1448755200,,800,4.5625

The dialogue was written for a kid's cartoon, with cheesy quips every few seconds and too much self-awareness. Ultron is one of the worst written villains in any movie. In the trailers, he is depicted as this fearsome robot nihilist. In the movie, he's a goofy, talkative, Napoleonic stereotype of a bad guy. By the time you get to the last action scene, you're still asking how the hell the plot advanced there, and then it's over.

I still have not gotten to the ending, and frankly I am in no particular hurry to see how it ends.  I loved the first AVENGERS movie, as well as the other Marvel movies but for various reasons, AOU just didn't hold my interest.

First, it was waaaaay too long and drawn out.  Second, it was too ""talky"" throughout, with uninteresting chatter, especially from the Ultron character.  Blah, blah, blah ... Third, some action / fight scenes were just too long and exhausting to watch.  In particular, the fight scene between Iron Man and the Hulk (wherein they destroyed 1.2 billion dollars of prime real estate) was unbearably over the top and a total CGI sensory overload.  That scene alone put me in a deep sleep.  Finally, the romance between Black Widow and Hulk was an unnecessary and unwanted sub-plot.

She kicks guys' butt the whole pic and constantly calls her war pals ""boys."" The biggest flaw is Ultron, to me, is a little weak at the end. We can't expect the film to follow the comic exactly.

6295508,5,B00IT70F3S,"Awesome first film gets a solid and eventful follow up. But the ending will all lead to a very unsettling sequel. When industrialist Tony Stark builds a defense system android to protect humanity, it becomes self aware and decides that the only way to prevent the ultimate destruction of humanity is to destroy it. Captain America warned him that could happen, and Stark does not give him a satisfactory answer when he asks him why he did it anyway. There's also a overdue bit of background on the relationship between Hawkeye and Black Widow and Hawkeye's family, and the return of a major player whose name I won't tell you, but it makes sense. Tremendous follow up with a lot of small side stories including a hint towards the next epic adventure. Although I loved it, I wondered why Thor was being so elusive and why Bruce was being such a tool. We will see in number three, apparently, and in future sequels made by Disney for you & me.

6295515,2,B00IT70F3S,"...it's okay because they were sleepwalking when they made it. I Love the Avenger's movie, the first one. I don't know (or care) how much money this film made, it is a huge disappointment. If it were merely half as good as the first I would've been happy. I actually dared to expect Whedon to build on the last Avenger's movie but contriving a love interest (Hulk/Widow, yeah right, even as she was giving her lines for why she loved Bruce she looked out of character- because she was-duh) and giving a character (who should have been the natural love interest for Black Widow) a family is not 'building' anything. Action is, at the same time, both over the top and uninteresting. They lost credibility with me in the opening action by going for unlikely action moves. Cap throwing his motorcycle when a better move was possible? No, Cap makes the best tactical move, not the egotistical move. Would Hulk or Iron Man? Sure. Not Cap. That's why the rest let him take the lead when the action starts. That's par of why Cap could get a wiggle out of Thor's hammer when Hulk can't budge it. Speaking of ol' Greenskin. Hulk vs IM's Hulkbuster armor battle? Hulk loses? Only thing Hulk character has going for him and it's marginalized to pump up Iron Man's character? Ultron ultimately ended up seeming generic and every time he spoke I kept thinking, ''Blacklist'', which I like, I just don't like it with my Avenger's movie. Not great dialogue either. Where's the witty repartee from the first? Most memorable scene (a month after viewing) was the ""Can you lift Thor's hammer?'' bit and that too could've been done way better. Unlike the original this one does not have a re-watchable factor to me. I still re-watch many scenes and sometimes the entire original. Nothing about this movie makes me think that will happen here. Did Joss forget the characters? Did Joss actually participate in making this movie? might be the better question. Every character was diminished in this movie except Robert Downey Jr, I mean, Iron Man. I like RDJ and Iron Man in their own flicks and in the original Avenger's as well but more head scratching scenery ensues when RDJ leaves the Iron Man armor to inspect the dangerous fortress. I guess it's in the contract so he could get more 'face' time. Yeah, yeah, I know he ordered the armor into 'protect' mode but where would you rather be inside the armor or out? With all the cool data collecting capabilities of the armor or your two bare eyes? Really have to ask if anyone read the script correcting inconsistencies or for anything beyond the spelling. Spell this production team, C-O-A-S-T-I-N-G.

Compare to the first one, it has much less scene about the personality of the heroes. It seems like that the director wants to show too many things and he can't handle the description of six main characters' personality very well. For example, how could the Hulk and Black widow just become lover? Because they are both monsters? If that, I am afraid I need to fall in love with everyone who has just one thing in common with me. Also, the movie supposed to show the conflict between the main characters and how their disagreement defuse, then united together as a team to solve the crisis. Probably because it only have two hours, but I still need to say that I don't understand how they just reunify again, it is a little abrupt for the audience who have not watch the first one. By the way, it has more advertisement than the first one too.",1447804800,,978,4.4088397790055245

Ultron was a great villian and the battle scenes were fantastic but just went on too long!
If the movie had slowed down and taken the time to explain why things were happening the movie would have been much better.
In closing;Avengers:Age of Ultron was a good movie that could have been great if it had not been so jam packed with action scenes and wasn't so intent on laying ground work for the next stage of the Marvel Movie Universe.

6295737,4,B00IT70F3S,"BIG fan of Thor, and the other Avengers.
But the main problem with this movie was that it suffers from the ""More is Bigger and Better"" syndrome - more fighting scenes, bigger explosions, and more (too many) characters to find story lines for. With so many to keep track of, I was left wondering how a main character was fairing when the action switched to the next one, and then to the next, and then the next, and etc.

There were almost too many characters in the first Avengers movie, so the addition of Quicksilver and Red Witch and 'Vision' just added to the confusion.

Plus there were three main fight scenes when two would have been plenty.

 And despite these seemingly negative comments, I knew I would buy the DVD just as soon as it was released.",1447718400,,757,4.463768115942029

My wife, who is NOT and ardent comic book follower, but does like some comic offerings, live action/cg and animated, found this quite disappointing over the first Avengers movie...and that is saying a lot for her. Oh and we went to a matinee vewing. I would have been really pissed if I had paid full boat.

6295854,3,B00IT70F3S,This is a tough one since I am a big Joss Weedon fan but this is mediocre at best.  Not knowing it was Weedon I was surprised at the intermittent humor which is one of his trademarks but the machinations of the plot were often vague and the characters were less likeable than they had been in the past.  Even Iron Man was kind of dull.  I wish he would do another SH movie.  Anyway not a big dissappointment but a disappointment all the same.  Note: they even somehow made SJ unattractive at times which has never been the case at any time I've ever seen her.  Luster is gone and this was just kinda boring.  Lithgow was a bad choice for the voice of Ultron because he also seemed kinda dull and more sarcastic than menacing.  I felt like I could kick Ultron's but!!?!!?  Someone pointed out to me that it was James Spader as ultron...Now I know I could kick Ultron's ass.  What a weak villan.  Less Iron Man and MOre Sherlock,1447632000,,926,4.264367816091954

Also, although I love most everything of what Joss Whedon makes, he is flat out wrong on his assumption that the Thor scenes that were cut would have helped the movie.  They are awful and they would have slowed it down even worse.  It would have been a better movie if they chopped ALL the side stories except one (I personally liked hawkeye's farm life, but would have been ok with Hulk and Widow's romance too) but so much of the ""visions"" that scarlet witch made were just wasted space that confused audiences and slowed the pacing.

Just didn't ring true to me...I like Nat and I like Banner, but together, not sure.  I didn't hate them...It just felt a little...rushed.  Like the producers/writers or whoever needed a romance or a side story to fill out the canvas.  They saw a bit of chemistry between these two then presto...instant-romance.  Mistake.  I think, it had potential...but it should have started out as a flirty kinda thing in the first Avengers movie...and then they could have realistically developed it into a more serious longing in this movie.  Kinda like they did with Tony and Pepper in the Ironman franchise.  In the first movie...there was a flirty kinda thing going on between them...which was developed further in Ironman 2....By the 3rd movie Tony & Pepper are an established in-love couple.

The action was whizbang, closeup, all over the place. It looked like they were just moving things around the screen as fast as they could with a bunch of posing in between. Mostly just gratuitous action. The final action scene where they are all fighting at the same time and the camera is swooshing around in place of being interesting was tedious at best.

They had to set the table for Phase Three. Scarlett Johansson was very pregnant and could barely be in the movie.  I get it. The deck was stacked.  But Whedon kind of got lost in all of that.  I've read the changes he made, how he ignored set ups from the second Thor and The Winter Soldier, but he just didn't produce a good movie. And it sucks for him cause he had to follow up what will probably end up being the best Marvel movie ever, The Winter Soldier. So you can keep up with what's going on without seeing this.

I enjoyed the first Avengers, the Iron Man flicks etc, but this was not even in the same league as anything that came before. It's an action movie and it has lots of action but none of it original or exciting. The ""villain"" was written to be more funny than scary and he was neither. And there was this sense of deja vu throughout. I was reminded of other movies, some good, some bad: Hellboy, Terminator, Transformers (not good). The worst thing an action move can be is boring. And this movie was seriously boring. The attempts at humor fall flat, the budding ""romance"" seemed an afterthought and tacked on to try and appeal to a wider audience. And some of the action scenes had such poor CGI it looked like a video game. The only character with any depth was Hawkeye but this was an ensemble piece so his storyline couldn't receive the time needed to flesh out his story. He deserves his own movie. How did this happen? I blame the scriptwriter. If there was one. At times it felt like I was watching an improv class. I'm glad I rented instead of buying; there's no need to ever watch this again.

6296133,5,B00IT70F3S,"As most know everything in the Marvel Universe (aside from the X Men and Fantastic 4 franchises, and the previous Spider Man movies) are telling one long, continuous intricate story leading up to the Avengers Infinity Wars movies.  The movies are telling the main story and the TV Shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, and Daredevil are either filling in some of the gaps or or are just on the fringe of the larger story.

This movie is continuing the story lines that played out in the first Avengers Movie and Captain America Winter Soldier.  It starts out with them mopping up the Hydra forces and trying to find Loki's scepter.  In the process Tony Stark and Bruce Banner start messing around with Artificial Intelligence, in the hope of creating a force that can replace the team of Avengers, and end up creating Ultron who is played brilliantly by James Spader.

The other main additions to the cast are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olson.  They of course were in the teaser scene at the end of Winter Soldier's credits and while most probably already know the role they play in the movie, I will not spoil it for those who have not yet seen the film.  But they both do a very good job playing what are ultimately conflicted characters.

One thing I really liked about this movie is it gave Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye a story line and more to do.  Instead of being the ""other one"" like he was for much of the first movie, he plays a large part in this one, and has some great sarcastic one liners.  It also sets up a transition in the Avengers line up with some characters taking a back seat by the end of the movie (seemingly anyway) and is definitely setting up the movies that are yet to come.

For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds great as expected.  For bonus material there are deleted scenes, a few behind the scenes features, a blooper reel and commentary on the movie by director Joss Whedon.  There is also a code included for more web based extras should you want to look at those.  Not a ton, but good for what is there for those who like to go through the bonus material.

All in all you pretty much know what you are getting with these movies.  If you are into the story and do not have superhero fatigue, then you will likely enjoy this.  If you are not all that into action/superhero movies then this one is not really going to do anything to change your mind.",1447027200,30,2457,4.436525612472161

I haven't seen much said about the 3D, it is pretty realistic, seems they finally figured out how to do it right and not just throw things at you out of context.  The vehicles and spacing were just spot on, I'm not sure what technology they used to film it, but I was impressed, and that doesn't happen every day.  The CGI was perfect, the Hulk looked real and convincing even in 3D, Iron Man flying around could have been really happening if you forget for a moment you are watching a movie, which lets face it, is the whole entire point of watching movies.  Great fun, lots of ""Hell yeah!"" moments, and keeps me excited for future films.  A++",1447027200,3,803,4.141935483870967

I didn't really like the opening scenes, it seemed like the CGI there wasn't done as well as in the rest of the movie.  Lots of character development, I loved the stuff about Hawkeye.  Ultron was an o.k. bad guy, he didn't really seem like a robot though, like he was in comics, they made him ""alive"" and he has a very human sort of personality.  There's no scene at the very end of the movie, just the mid credits scene, it's just Thanos getting the infinity gauntlet and saying ""Now I do this myself.""  I mean what have you been doing all this time????  But everybody says that.
I did like Ant-man better, but that's because it was something new and not just a sequel to something.  Overall this is not better than Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Avengers, or Cap 2, but it's not bad.",1446940800,,951,4.186813186813187

Joss has ruined the Black Widow, and made a movie that seems disconnected from the MCU.

6296247,5,B00IT70F3S,"I really enjoyed this. Yes, it is over-the-top, but I recommend you suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the fun. SPOILERS!!!  SPOILERS!!! I'm supposed to believe that a certain character has a family and normal home life despite his usual vocation? And exactly how did he keep that a secret?!! I know that Captain America is supposed to have enhanced, superhuman strength, but when did he become so strong that he can throw motorcycles through (yes, I said ""through"") trucks? And how is it that Hawkeye and Black Widow are supposed to be ""normal"" humans, but can successfully destroy like a zillion robots made of steel? I could go on, but I think you get the picture. As I said, just enjoy the fun! (I sure missed Loki, though!)",1446681600,,731,4.666666666666667

But, if I really have to seriously review it, I'd say it's shallower than the other Avengers-centric movies, and the jokes are more situational instead of being based on any sort of character personality or relying on knowledge of the franchise at all.",1446681600,,357,4.774193548387097

6296258,1,B00IT70F3S,"I'm very surprised by the acclaim from the reviews here on Amazon.  65% 5 star ratings?  Really?  This is as good as it gets for you?

The pacing is ridiculous. The character development/progression is terrible. At no point do you feel like the heroes are threatened by the villain. The objective of the villain is very poorly explained. Why are quicksilver/scarlett witch in the movie? Hawkeye's side-story? The forced love story of BW and Hulk? The dream sequence?  The Vision's arrival? This might as well been written/directed by Michael Bay.  Poor effort.

It's sad to see so many movies not put story first.  If you can't tell a coherent story, what's the point?  Especially in something as awesome as the Marvel Universe.  I am going to be very disappointed if Infinity War is not handled well. Hopefully Thanos isn't as big of a joke as Ultron.",1446681600,15,852,4.773972602739726

In other words since Disney has the distribution control for home formats of the Marvel Cinematic Universe I have realized a lower quality in ""Special or Collector's Edition"" than Paramount's editions used to release.",1446681600,4,687,4.982608695652174

6296441,5,B00IT70F3S,"Am I the only one who thinks this is just a very expensive prequel to Captain America:Civil War?

Anyway, I greatly enjoyed the origin of the Vision and the voice of Ultron.  I still think it's a shame that Hank Pym was not involved in Ultron's creation, but I've got to admit that Stark's obsession with technology would be a likely source of Ultron's genesis.

I had the sense of rushed plotting in some ways. Baron strucker leaves the Marvel franchise ignominously and too quickly.  The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are not well-developed enough int he final cut (although the Blu-ray EXTRAS help with this).  Captain America, Iron Man and Thor are too well known as ""commodities"" to be consistently interesting here.  They don't really grow or develop -- nor do they need to.  They simply are who they are.

I would have preferred the Avengers reckon with how Phil Coulson survived (in TV's Agents of SHIELD) than to see Nick Fury reappear.  There is also a bit of a deus ex machina feel every time Fury's involved in the plot.  I find that ironic because int he las movie he seemed to take a certain amount of pride that he wasn't a god (deus) like Loki.  Times change a man, I guess?

But Hawkeye, Bruce Banner, and the Black Widow come into much sharper focus here.  This was very welcoeme.  There finally seemed to be a reason for Hawkeye to be one the Avengers.  And his interactions with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were particularly effective.

Stan Lee's cameo was genius. Falcon and War Machine put in fine guest appearances. Someone needs to give Anthony Mackie (Falcon) his own movie.

The true highlight of the film for me, though, was the origin of the Vision.  In case there are people who have not seen the film at all, I won't dwell on why each moment the Vision was ont he screen was so well done.  But let's just say this -- Paul Bettany was perfect.

I look forward to his next appearance.

In the EXTRAS, take a look at Thor's cut scenes.  I understand why some people would have been confused, but I would have preferred them to be in the film.  IT sure made Thor's sudden RE-appearance in the film make more sense.",1446336000,,2147,4.51948051948052

6296476,3,B00IT70F3S,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie in the theater and saw it on opening day. I need to say it's not worth the hype. Joss Whedon is given too much praise as the geek to end all geek directors, and although I liked his sophomore film effort of the first Avengers movie, this failed to live up to my expectations.

The good news is that the action scenes are a lot of fun and can be played on repeat. The Hulk vs. Hulk buster fight is great, and the end battle is fun.

Hawkeye gets more attention, and he's funny throughout the third act of the film.

Bad news: The film is too crowded with characters. It features the four main Avengers, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Ultron, The Vision, War Machine, Nick Fury and Falcon. Too many characters and not enough screen time.

The theme of doing one's ""job"" was so overdone I gave an audible sigh each time I heard it.

The jokes are overdone, and some are poorly timed, especially given a character's death at the end, it loses the emotional impact because of a joke right when they die.

I'm glad Whedon is not returning for the last two films. He's outstayed his welcome.",1446249600,,1146,4.407582938388626

6296493,3,B00IT70F3S,"I found it okay, but nothing like as good as the first Avengers film.

What stood out for me was Ultron's alter egos channeling the Chitauri (that struck me when I watched the scrambling-up-the-side-of-the-building scene), the nod to X3, when Magneto re-purposed the Golden Gate bridge and Ultron pulled up by the roots the capital city of country-with-fake-Slavic-name, and, of all things, the quick genuflection to the late Robert Heinlein.  It's interesting that Renner got the bigger, more complex part for Hawkeye that he wanted.  I thought the cameos for Skarsgrd, Mackie, & Atwell were a bit pointless.  At least Jackson and Cheadle got actual bit parts.

It appeared from the last scene that Stark, Thor, and Banner have retired from the Avengers ---who have a nifty new headquarters in upstate NY, which must mean that the Avengers didn't get painted with the same brush SHIELD did, despite their being a SHIELD, or at least Fury, project.  How nice for them.  So will the next ensemble film leave those 3 very popular chars out?

I guess my summation, after watching it a second time, would be:  pro-forma.  It was a pro-forma effort.",1446163200,,1144,4.911458333333333

It's a cliche-riddled mess that gives a fragment of a villain and evil machinations that make little sense. It takes little pokes at being philosophical but it's all too brief and underdeveloped. It follows what appears to be a formula for Avengers movies: someone grabs Loki's scepter, bad things are made, an undifferentiated army of drones must be pushed back, and the MacGuffin is disabled. There are brief flashes of emotion that appear to be some effort at character depth, but they are so ephemeral and unbelievable that they cannot imprint on the viewer's mind.

I liked the Hulk/BW relationship angle they put in.

Cons: Cap is useless in this. Thor is a worrisome coward in this. The beginning seems to be a sequel to either Cap 2 or the cartoon series from 2011 which may confuse others who have only seen Avengers 1 or Avengers 1 and the Ironman series since Cap 1 sucked so why would you have seen 2. Also, introducing characters only to kill them off.

Verdict: Rent, ignore or wait for one of the other, better Marvel movies to come out.",1445904000,,599,4.339285714285714

6296627,1,B00IT70F3S,"Wow. Just another massively overhyped, overlong and oversold blockbuster. Everybody involved looks bored to tears, and who could blame them. I know I was. A great cast goes through the motions, says their lines, yadda yadda, and most of them bow out at the end, looking relieved to be done with it. And again, who could blame them?  At almost two and a half hours it feels interminable and I'd say it's at least an hour and a half too long. It's like stretching a Scooby Doo episode to Doctor Zhivago length. There are maybe 20 minutes of fun action near the end. Some typically rascally Whedon laff lines sprinkled through. Otherwise, for all the noise and bombast, it lies there flat as roadkill. Vies with Jurassic World and Tomorrowland for the worst, most pointless big blockbuster of the year.",1445817600,,799,4.707142857142857

One character's 'ability' seemed not well drawn--almost limitless in some scenes and then, crucially, not! All for a melodramatic moment and to deliver a pay-off one-liner. Dumb. :-(

They keep sending you in circles then you still cannot download a digital copy to your home cloud N.A.S. I don't use my DVDs I put them on my own N.A.S system so I can watch them on what I want I do not use a cloud because my internet is limited.

6296725,4,B00IT70F3S,"Ultron has all the bells and whistles, but does manage to include some of the background stories for its characters. You learn a little bit more about them, and why they are who and what they are. I much prefer the Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in this movie over the X-Men movies, but I have to say I enjoyed all the X-Men movies, even if they did veer from the comics a little. Stan Lee does a cameo in this one which was a treat.

My favorite part was the casting of James Spader as the voice of Ultron. He steals the show without ever actually appearing in the movie. I'm also glad that they cast the physical Vision character with the same voice actor they used for the voice of Jarvis, Paul Bettany. The scene where both Vision and Ultron meet at last was done well. Both actors have just the right inflections.

If you enjoy movies made around the comic book characters, this is a good one to see.",1445558400,,904,4.280701754385965

6296735,5,B00IT70F3S,"What can I say? I really really enjoyed this vid! You know, it's kinda weird, I was not a comic book fan and I was never that crazy about the whole Marvel-Saturday-morning thing either...BUT, then the Iron Man movies came out and BAM, I'm a fan. The Thor series was pretty cool as well. I wasn't that impressed with the Spider Man, nor the Superman remakes; but Captain America, was way better than I thought...Okay, do you see the pattern forming there? Subconsciously I was becoming a fan. I had favorites (Iron Man) I had favorite villains, for instance (think Willam Dafoe as The Goblin, fantastic!)

And then the Avengers came out.

Once again, fantastic!!!! Yes, four exclamation points worth of ""YAY"". The first one was great, this new one, Age of Ultron was just as good, if not better because this vid (in my humble opinion) did not rely so much on CGI. This one was more about the PEOPLE. The ""Supers"" if you will. Hawkeye has a wife and kids. Bruce Banner gets to show how brilliant he is, how cool he is, as scientist. Yes, The Hulk was pivotal in the fight against Ultron and his Robo-Soldiers, but at least Banner got some air time without being green. And The Black Widow; the terrible things she endured as a child to become an elite assassin was shocking, even by today's standards. Besides.(Scarlett Johansson is such a hottie, I mean..well, never mind) ANYWAY, the point IS: This is good stuff. If you've not seen this vid (geeky Comic-Con dude, or dudess, or just a new fan like me) you're going to love it! My wife even liked it! That's a miracle in and of itself! Seriously, she hates my action and horror tastes, and I don't like her fairytale oversexed vampire thing...different strokes I guess. But my point is simple: you'll love it.",1445558400,2,1759,4.580952380952381

6296776,4,B00IT70F3S,"This is a worthwhile admission to the Marvel movie universe, but it certainly isn't the best one.  The first Avengers movie brought with it some clever writing, and a coherent story.  This is somewhat more contrived (well, they're all contrived, being fiction, particularly comic/fantasy fiction).  In that, I mean that the characters and writing feel a little forced.

However, I do like the way that the ultimate over arching story of the infinity stones and infinity gauntlet are being continued across multiple cross-over character films, just like the story was told in the nineties in the comic book form.

Seriously looking forward to Civil war and the inclusion of spiderman into the avengers.  I sure wish that Fox had no control over any of the marvel characters, because it would be great to get a decent rendition of the FF finally achieved.",1445472000,,853,4.971830985915493

Iron Man 3 doesn't seem to fit with the series, but other than that it's good to go.  It was nice seeing a lot of the secondary characters from the individual heros' movies make appearances, as well.  James Spader as Ultron was perfectly cast, although it's hard to not see his character from ""The Blacklist"" in your mind whenever he talks; the nuances of the personalites of Ultron and Red Reddington are extremely similar.

The movie does suffer by the end, however.  Throughout the series of movies, they've done a very good job of keeping most of the hokey-ness out of it.  This movie fails to do that, however, and by the end turns into a serious eye-roll-fest for anyone not familiar with the comic books.  The last half-hour or so of the movie seems to indicate that Marvel has peaked.

6296845,2,B00IT70F3S,"I don't know why I rented this movie since I didn't like the other avenger ones. I guess because they are popular so I keep hoping that it'll be good.

This movie is just 90% action and fighting. I guess people like that, but I prefer a good storyline and character development. I kept thinking the movie must be over now, then what seems like an hour later it was still going on with the fighting. Just never ending fighting. I honestly don't find it entertaining if that's all it is. A good fight scene is great, but a fight movie is just boring. This movie felt like it has some kind of attention problem and just blasted through random things.

There were a couple of funny lines, but all in all I regret renting this movie.",1445385600,,728,4.306569343065694
6296846,4,B00IT70F3S,"I really enjoyed the first Avengers movie and also the Thor movie however, this movie did not live up to the prior Avengers for the action.  It took awhile for it to become an action movie.  Some parts I felt were almost boring.  But the plot was a good one but I didn't really feel this movie did it justice.  The ending was good for possible future movies with different actors.  Hopefully, if they do another movie I hope there is more action.",1445385600,,446,4.325301204819277

The plastic seal wrap was split along the side,  it would be tough,  but it would be possible to fit the disc out of it.  So I'm assuming that someone between production and consumer,  someone came up on a free 3D Blu-ray disc.",1445299200,,385,4.164383561643835

6296855,3,B00IT70F3S,"Eh. Lots of money spent on CGI that maybe should have gone for finding better writers.  Maybe I'm finally outgrowing the genre, but sometimes when the dialogue is all testosterone and everyone is angry at all times just for the sake of having angry drama, I wish for a little more depth and intelligence.  I know, I know, its a superhero movie, but Spiderman (the first two with Tobey Maguire) was able to pull off a blend of CGI, testosterone AND good writing.  Why can't these other films in the genre do the same?  I can go along with lots of stupid for the sake of being entertained, but when its all bad dialogue and bravado, the fantasy crumbles and its just noise.",1445299200,,671,4.430894308943089

The action was heavy, as was the CGI (as to be expected), and the story lacking.  The handful of times that they focused on the storylines, they felt rushed & unpolished.

However, that being said, I enjoyed the one-liners & was definitely entertained.  However, I can definitely see where the Marvel superfans might take issue........",1445212800,,558,4.967741935483871
