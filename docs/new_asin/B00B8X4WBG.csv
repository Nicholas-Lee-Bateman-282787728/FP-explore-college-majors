5563497,5,B00B8X4WBG,I loved this documentary; giving me an extraordinary insight into the profession of Nursing.  Its historical timeline context takes the viewer through the development of Nursing from its earliest settings to the current complex environments where nurses may find themselves administering care to those who need it at the most vulnerable time in their lives.  We should celebrate the contributions of nurses to the betterment of our communities every day of our lives.  One never knows when one may need their assistance.,1462579200,3,520,5.317073170731708

5563501,3,B00B8X4WBG,"Many thoughtful comments if you are over 40 years old.  I had hoped to use it for an Intro ""inspiration"" for nursing students but decided not to due to concern of not being able to maintain student's attention.  The portions with actual nursing shots are excellent.  BUT there were too many ""mature"" nurses discussing their philosophy...nothing wrong with what they said but not level to maintain the interest of young students.  45 minutes would have been sufficient.  The nurse patient stories were inspiring.",1454544000,,511,5.108433734939759

5563511,3,B00B8X4WBG,"Found it long and lost interest after a bit... good for general public awareness, but not for professionals... kind of redundant for professionals. Good to help make the public aware of what we as nurses do every day.",1420070400,,217,4.7368421052631575
5563512,5,B00B8X4WBG,"A very well done documentary style film about real-life modern nurses, who tell their stories with passion and purpose.

5563514,4,B00B8X4WBG,"If ever there was a film with its heart in the right place, this is it. Released in time for National Nurses Week (May 6  12, 2013), it would be hard to find a better tribute to the women (and men) who serve humanity as nurses.

The film itself is rudimentary. It is rock-bottom, basic storytelling to the max, with countless talking heads (nurses) telling their stories. This observation is not meant as a criticism, however, for anything more technically showy (fancy camera work and editing, for example) mightve taken the focus away from the subjects. The program could have stood a slightly more creative presentation of its material, however. The import of the subject is slightly flattened by the somewhat dry style.

But, given the secondary title of the film If Florence Could See Us Now, it is entirely appropriate that a certain modesty be preserved in the presentation of these nurses stories. Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, was a very proper Victorian lady, after all. Her setting aside her life of privilege to work in the service of others  beginning in the mud, blood and filth of the Crimean War   remains a remarkable and inspiring act of service towards others.

Taken for what it is  part tribute, part documentation, part inspiration  NURSES is a wonderful experience. Its also long overdue. How many television programs with a medical theme focus primarily on doctors? How many on nurses? And this is precisely the point of NURSES: to shine the spotlight on those who normally toil in the background while others take most of the credit. Theres a lot more to the old Vaudeville joke (You should see a doctor! Id rather see a nurse! wink wink) than the surface meaning. Nurses, by and large, are some of the most compassionate, loving and caring individuals we will meet in our lives, sometimes at the most critical times.

NURSES is, in that respect, beyond criticism. It behooves us to watch, listen, then say  when the opportunity presents itself  thank you.",1397433600,,2004,4.8617647058823525
5563515,3,B00B8X4WBG,"I think the strength of a hospital or a medical facility lies in its nurses. They are the caretakers of a patient's health. With that said I was a bit disappointed in this DVD.
It has no subtitles and the narration is mostly from nurses interviewed and many of their voices are soft, sometimes muddled and at points hard to understand.  The nurses describe how they have made a difference in patents' lives and even how patients have touched them. We mainly see them sitting and talking into the camera. It would have been so much better to show what they do. You see a few moments of them working with patients, but it would be better show the scope of their duties and let there be narration over it.

The main film is 92 minutes long and there are extras of: Jonathan and Laurie Reunion - 5 years since the moment that changed their lives, an extended interview with Marla Weston - CEO, American Nurses Association (ANA). One of the members wants all nurses to donate $10 to the organization. Alayna Davis, RN - Helps her patient get married and an interview with Kathy Douglas, RN, Film Director. Nurses also describe what they think of Florence Nightingale and what she would think of the profession today.

Those who are interested about making nursing a career would be fascinated in this. For others 92 minutes of mainly watching faces talking into the camera is difficult. They could have demonstrated so much more for such a worthy subject.",1386547200,2,1450,4.634241245136187

8564308,3,B00B8X4WBG,"Having gone through 40 years of clinical Nursing, I'd skip the first 30 minutes of this video.  Far too much emphasis BEGINNING & END of life Nursing. GREAT NURSES have to know  & learn as much or more than most docs. Nursing is indeed a SCIENCE.",1488067200,,246,4.326086956521739

8564310,2,B00B8X4WBG,"Just didn't like it.  I couldn't get past much of the beginning, because it's too focused on pharmaceuticals and the like.  While I agree that to be a nurse, one must have lots of compassion and zeal to help people, it's a vastly under appreciated profession and the total focus is not on the patient, but on bureaucracy, paperwork and the lack of real patient care and touch.  I remember when we used to give back rubs and skin to skin contact was encouraged.  Now it's all about putting on gloves to avoid any skin to skin contact.  Now, I realize that this is needed with isolation and other instances, but it's not in my opinion changed for the better.
I see many of the new nurses coming out of school or in school and they have no clue what they are doing, because they haven't had much clinical experience.  It's all about the ""book learning"" and less ""hands on"".  I'm a Diploma nurse and very proud of that.  We were the best nurses before they decided to shut down our schools.  Who do you think took care of the patients on the floors?  As seniors in nursing school, we were heading up teams of 12+ patients and doing all the procedures and passing meds.  Many nursing students coming out of school now days, just don't have the skills necessary, because they haven't learned them in school.  I'm for bringing back the Diploma programs and letting people ""really get their hands dirty"" when it comes to caring for a patient!",1478563200,,1434,4.473076923076923
