173853,1,0972223371,"The truth of the matter is stories impact people in all ways. To say Harry Potter is bad because it encourages kids into a lifestyle of ""evil"" ways excludes all of the pother stories which do the exact same thing, but Christians forget about. This is propaganda of its highest form. This reader had completely missed the point of Harry Potter. It's kind of embarrassing to also admit to writing and published a book about the dangers of Harry Potter BEFORE actually reading the series.",1394668800,12,485,4.7176470588235295
173854,1,0972223371,"The first time I was introduced to the Harry Potter series (between books 3 & 4 and movies 1 &2), I was in the car listening to a ""Christian"" talk radio station when the commentator emphatically stated he would ""rather feed his kids cocaine and have them watch hardcore porn than read Harry Potter.""  Well, with that I had to ask ""what is so bad about this book?""

This book is more of the same and represents a fundamentally isolated point of view.  If you are looking for a great discussion of Christian themes and modes in Harry Potter, there is a better, more informed book to read than this one.",1393718400,24,600,4.387387387387387

173856,1,0972223371,"Listened to this on the suggestion of a friend. More christian hate-mongering. I love Harry Potter books. They have great stories and teach about good triumphing over evil. The thing I'll never understand is that Christians have no problem with the Narnia books, which involves sacrificing someone with a knife, huge battles where thousands are killed, a ""witch"" who has worked her magic to turn the entire world into ice and cold. Yet, in the same breath, will demean a Harry Potter book for having a few door opening spells and teaching the message that no matter how bad it gets, good will triumph over evil.

I think many people who hate on Potter have never read it. They assume that it's full of real spells, dark magic and how children can become real wizards. Well, wizards are not real. Magic is not real. Spells are not real. So if you're afraid that a bunch of kids will turn to real wizardry by reading Harry Potter, I say it's time you get back to the crib and let us adults run the world.",1381881600,21,1002,4.475409836065574
173857,1,0972223371,"Why do responsible book sellers publish items like this? Everyone is entitled to a private point of view, no matter how nonsensical or unpopular it is, but how does our culture let something as poorly done as this become commercially viable?  I am assuming its presence here on audible attest to the fact that it must have some commercial viability.  And to think there are geniuses yet to be discovered who can't get past the commercial barriers of discovery/being published.

The notion that the Harry Potter series is bad for mental development or the spiritual well being of anyone is so out-of-step with reality that one has to wonder how did the author's world view become so distorted and corrupt? How did our modern society fail people who think this way. Did the author choose not to educate himself, or is this just a twisted attempt to take advantage of one of the most incredible literary events ever to draw attention to himself? If the author's intentions are in earnest, this highlights the very real dangers associated with blindly immersing oneself in nonsensical view points long enough, they will see ""good as evil"" and visa versa.  Such is the plague of the zeal without knowledge.",1377302400,63,1201,4.84390243902439
173858,1,0972223371,"alright lets make this clear. harry potter is A NOVEL. just because its about magic and wizards DOESNT MEAN IT OFFENDS GOD. the writing of jk rowling IS FICTIONAL NOT REALITY. honestly, we need books like harry potter. steve do you think its not ok for there to be magic, special powers, and different gods? i understand your faith for god but without fantasy novels we engulf literacy into a new age of boredom. lets face it. we need to think outside of the box. we cant just assume one book is like the anti christ trying to corrupt children's minds. people have different interests you know. fantasy novels have made a huge impact in our lives. people love them or people hate them. but its out of charactor for one to judge how novels like jk rowling are a threat to god. you should know that by now.",1375920000,10,804,4.402684563758389

The whole plot is a struggle against unlawful hierarchy and evil culminating the fact that everyone deserves a chance and that is it actions and attitude not birth or status that matter.",1495411200,2,278,5.065217391304348

7794466,1,0972223371,This book is everything you could ask for in a great fiction story! Great characters and plot an soo much drama is you are a Harry Potter fam this will be a great addition! OK for reals the book is hilarious the author is so convinced that Harry Potter is ruining the lives of children around the world and JK Rowling's just wants to bring Satan into your life!,1435881600,2,361,4.246376811594203
7794467,1,0972223371,"I read this book on Kindle. Wow. It always amazes me when people criticize literature based on religious fundamentalism. The Harry Potter series is about good struggling against evil - and after a long, painful fight, winning. The books are about self sacrifice, humility, and doing the right thing when it costs so much more to do so. They are about using one's talents for good... for service to others.

And these fundamentalists just hear ""magic"" and immediately reject the entire thing. Simple minded and ignorant.

As for the writing, the author could use some serious assistance with his grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and word usage. It does not help his message to write poorly. He organized the content well enough,  but the arguments within are simple and his writing is too redundant. I only need hear something once. And when I read something that purports to be analytical, I expect at minimum, a modicum of logic and intelligence. Furthermore, it is obvious that the author did not actually read the Harry Potter series.

I read this book on the insistence of a co-worker. It was a waste of my time; mercifully, I am a swift reader. I expected at least SOME kind of intellectual challenge. This book fails on all possible counts.",1434326400,9,1255,4.877934272300469

7794469,1,0972223371,"Only two things need to be said in response to ""Hidden Dangers in Harry Potter.""

First, the Harry Potter books are deeply Christian works (just like Narnia and Lord of the Rings before them).  J.K. Rowling said in an interview with MTV in 2008 that the books were ""obviously Christian"", but that she had purposefully refrained from saying anything about their Christian themes until the publication of the final book, because she thought it would spoil the ending (Harry dies a sacrificial death and then returns from the dead to conquer death/sin/Satan).

Second, if you want to read a much more informed, intelligent, and scholarly interpretation of the Harry Potter series from a Christian perspective, see the works of John Granger (the ""Hogwarts Professor""), specifically&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-Harry-Cast-His-Spell-The-Meaning-Behind-the-Mania-for-J-K-Rowling-s-Bestselling-Books/dp/1414321880/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How Harry Cast His Spell: The Meaning Behind the Mania for J.
