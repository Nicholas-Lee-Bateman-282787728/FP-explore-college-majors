3803036,4,B001KP0KZ4,"This film is foreign--from India I believe...and you always have to base what is good by their particular standards.

What is good about it:
-the characters are well played, well developed, and interesting
-the plot does have a lot of interesting twists
-if you are interested in seeing stuff from other cultures, this movie is nice because it gives a lot of concepts and has music as well

The problems of the movie may not be problems to them but to someone who is from another culture watching it.  The movie was LONG or seemed LONG.  It has music and dancing, which while enjoyable to some degree, added some extra minutes to an already complicated movie.  The movie wasn't scary for a ghost story.  It was also a bit perplexing because it was a mixture of several ideas--both theirs and ours, and I didn't think it totally worked.

Actually, this movie showed me the problems with missionaries trying to convert people to Christianity.  People never totally give up the religions they were brought up in, and all they wind up doing is mixing their beliefs with the religion they convert to...and the result is a confusing mess.  Why I'm mentioning this is that the movie deals with demonic possession...or I think it does.  I was a little confused really...but I liked it.",1431734400,4,1277,4.711711711711712
3803037,5,B001KP0KZ4,"Director Vikram Bhatt does a credible job of directing a first class atmospheric period horror film in ""1920"". I love period dramas, and I enjoy atmospheric horror films and in ""1920"", audiences are treated to both. The fact that this is a Bollywood film had the skeptic in me wondering if it would be a tad over the top. I didn't think so and felt the story was well-paced with genuine chilling moments throughout.

The story focuses on a young, newly married couple, Arjun and Lisa. The couple have been through hell and back to be together since Arjun comes from a high caste Hindu family, and Lisa is of mixed Indian and British parentage. Lisa is a devout Catholic but the formerly pious Arjun renounces his faith after witnessing Lisa's brutal treatment at the hands of his father and henchmen.  Luckily, the couple escape with their lives and marry.

Some time later, Arjun, who is an architect by profession, is given a wonderful and exciting opportunity: he is to take a look at a historic old mansion with the ultimate objective of tearing it down and rebuilding a grand hotel in its place. Lisa tags along but from the first moment she sets eyes on the place, feels a strange connection to the mansion, a feeling of anticipation and dread at the same time. Arjun's work necessitates him leaving Lisa to carry out his business, and this is when Lisa begins to experience bizarre things: strange sounds, visions, etc. Eventually, she realizes the place is haunted and brings in a Catholic priest to bless the place. The priest does so and leaves, thinking everything is ok. However, that very night, the priest's very life is placed in danger and he then realizes that the entity that is haunting the mansion is pure evil and has malevolent intentions towards Lisa.

The rest of the story revolves around the priest's attempts to save Lisa and overcome Arjun's initial skepticism (he thinks his wife's illness is due to natural causes). There are some truly chilling moments in this film such as the scene where Arjun wakes up to find Lisa missing from bed and then comes upon a horrific sight. There are also scenes of exorcism that I felt were well-done, creating a genuine feeling of horror in the viewer. I'm not much for films about demonic possession but this film really drew me in primarily due to the storyline that focuses on history (the flashbacks tell us about the Sepoy Mutiny in India and how what happened then affected the latter events involving Arjun and Lisa), themes of reincarnation and the power of faith and love.

There are several song items in this film which is typical Bollywood except that I felt the songs did not detract from the film's focus and message. Overall, this is an excellent Bollywood horror film and I am definitely adding it to my list of favorite Bollywood horror movies.",1431216000,5,2826,4.712550607287449
3803038,5,B001KP0KZ4,"The movie started slow but as I progressed it was worth the wait I think this movies is great for a foreign movie, it reminds me of some of these American possession movies  thumbs up to the directors. I'm a horror buff and I really enjoyed this movie.",1430352000,5,252,4.25
3803039,4,B001KP0KZ4,"You won't be dissappointed if i tell u the thing that 1920 is one of the greatest horror movie made in bollywood..

If u're looking for a horror stuff for your weekend.. no doubt, go for 1920..

The movie unfolds the story of a couple who were deeply in love with one another and how the ""special"" thing happened in another ""one's"" life possessed there living..

3803041,3,B001KP0KZ4,"I enjoyed watching the dual systems (cultural: East and West and religious Hindu and Christianity/Catholicism) juxtaposed yet intertwined. The movie itself streamlined very well despite slightly cheesy graphics in the beginning of the film, it nonetheless provided better suspenseful acting and effects toward the ending that made it truly enjoyable as a possession type horror film. This is my first horror genre Bollywood movie I've seen and have to say that I really did enjoy it.",1458000000,,483,5.368421052631579

3803048,4,B001KP0KZ4,"1920 was actually not that bad. It wasn't really that scary, but it was suspenseful enough to keep me engaged . The acting could have been a lot better, but the period the story was set in, kind of made up for it. I didn't watch the credits long enough to see where the estate in the movie was located , but it was amazing and and it gave the movie just the right amount of Gothic creepy horror, to keep me entertained. I still gave it a 4, because even though it could have been better, I'm more likely to remember it longer than most movies.  It was good old fashion horror.",1440633600,2,576,4.097345132743363
