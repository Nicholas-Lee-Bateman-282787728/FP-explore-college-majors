Keep that in mind as you watch the movie, otherwise you're going to waste time trying to ""figure out what's going on"" and miss some of the story-line clues. This is especially important because there is practically no ""back story"" at all - you simply get dropped into the strangely connected story of two people who really dislike each other - and for good reasons. Be sure to have your popocorn and drink ready to go, so you can watch from the very first second it starts! This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie - provided you're okay with English subtitles and that occasionally odd, but always intriguing, Euro-art-house sort of vibe.",1453852800,,688,4.741666666666666
8519918,5,B007OWUZY8,"I had the chance to see this at our local film festival 2 years ago, and have been waiting for the US release for a long time. I was even fortunate enough to meet the director and editor of the film, and they are incredible. This movie is unique, touching, has an excellent music track, and is so original.
One of the many things the director shared with us during a Q&A was the fact that the sand was actually very cold - the actors had to keep warm buried under the sand by wearing lots of extra clothes.",1366761600,,506,4.121212121212121

If you are looking for something not the same as the rest this will fill the void",1345852800,3,141,4.2592592592592595
8519920,5,B007OWUZY8,"This movie is great! It's very original and extremely funny. I love that it has a dark, eerie feel to it. This is the ANTI-HOLLYWOOD. No gimmicks or special effects, just a very entertaining and hilarious story. The more I watch it, the more I like it. I keep finding new details that I hadn't seen before.",1337299200,4,306,4.385964912280702
