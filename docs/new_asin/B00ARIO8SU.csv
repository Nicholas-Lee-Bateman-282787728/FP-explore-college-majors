8556861,2,B00ARIO8SU,"Anyone expecting Nightwish is going to be hugely disappointed. Oddly this Blu-ray was my first introduction to either Tarja or Nightwish. Someone I know at a record store conned me into buying this for $16 (used). ""You don't know Tarja? You've heard of Nightwish, right?"" I plunked down my money and took this home expecting some symphonic metal, but what I got was tepid Christmas music - kind of like a Finnish version of the old Andy Williams Christmas specials I had to watch as a kid. It's so boring that it set my Nightwish fandom experience back at least two years - it was that long before I happened to YouTube a Nightwish concert and found out how great they really are, and Tarja once was. I do give it a couple of stars because she's got a great voice, but just know what you're getting here is not even remotely like Nightwish.",1496361600,,840,4.461038961038961
8556862,4,B00ARIO8SU,Not much english going on. But its still a great performance. Tarja's voice is even more beautiful than she is. I've been fascinated by her since i purchased Once by Nightwish. I own everything by Nightwish as well as some of Tarja's solo material. Her Act 1 blu-ray is totally killer. As is End of an Era blu-ray by Nightwish. Anything she does is essential listening.,1363564800,2,369,4.606060606060606
