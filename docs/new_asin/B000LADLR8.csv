8160433,5,B000LADLR8,"The real strength in this particular video is in the instructions and demonstrations of yoga postures for plus size people.  Three women demonstrate yoga postures for people at different levels of flexibility and strength.  These ladies have either large bellies or large breasts and one of them appears to be of African descent.
Only the instructor gives directions and suggestions during the yoga session.  Her voice is slightly cheer-leader-ish but her instructions for modifying the postures are excellent.
There is room for improvement in the camera work and and music.  However, I suggest that any large size person interested in safely modifying yoga to their individual body purchase this video.
Also purchase Yoga for Couch Potatoes with Yogi Marlon.  Another helpful video for modifying yoga to your body is Yoga for Inflexible People.",1196035200,2,845,5.323308270676692
8160434,5,B000LADLR8,"I am a bigger woman, and found myslef very disappointed with the fact that I was unable to do many of the traditional yoga poses that can be found on other videos.  I came across this video from a friend and am very happy with it.  The best part about it is the fact that three different women are doing the poses on the screen at the same time. Each woman is doing the same pose in a different way and for a different level.

One may be doing it ""easy"" with the aid of a chair, the other maybe using a prop such as a block for a ""medium"", while the third may be doing it in a little more ""advanced"" way without the aid of any props.  What is great about this dvd is how once you start advancing, you can follow the same video but choose a different woman to emulate and therefore follow the more advanced poses.",1170806400,8,812,4.024844720496894
