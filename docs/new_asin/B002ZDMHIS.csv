4017682,4,B002ZDMHIS,"I liked this movie since my humor is similar. The characters and little twists were a good surprise to me. Give it go and in some way give it a chance.

4017683,2,B002ZDMHIS,"The premise - a young law student is visited by a rough-hewn 'enforcer' who threatens to rearrange the young man's face if he doesn't pay an 800,000 yen debt.  Before we know it, the enforcer and said young man are wandering the streets of Tokyo - one last taste of freedom before the enforcer turns himself in for killing his wife during a domestic squabble. This has potential, but it isn't realized here.  The acting is in some cases wooden, in others histrionic in the extreme. There is no forward momentum, no real character development, and some odd attempts at humor that fall flat, odder attempts at emotion that are simply cloying, dime store sentiment.  The film is also technically deficient - it appears to have been shot by a film school student - and not one at the top of his class. It seems the idea here was to convey a deep, unexpected connection between the thug and the student. The movie fails to do so.  You will wait, and wait some more, and finally reach the end of this journey, expecting a meaningful denouement.  Unless you are able to find something in this film that simply escaped me, you will be left disappointed, as I was.",1361577600,3,1155,4.533653846153846
4017684,5,B002ZDMHIS,"""In my 8th college year, I thought buying 3-color toothpaste could spare me from my rock bottom situation.""

Those are the first words of the film as spoken by Fumiya (J Odagiri) just before debt collector Fukuhara (Tomokazu Miura) bursts into his apartment, removing his shoes at the front door as is Japanese custom, and roughs him up. The next day the debt collector offers Fumiya an opportunity to erase his debt: walk with him around Tokyo. What we get is a road movie, a very funny road movie, where the unlikely duo walk instead of drive. There's eventual male bonding, marvelous footage of Tokyo, and a smorgasbord of odd characters and situations along the way.

Writer/Director Satoshi Miki has a stable of comedic actors who work with him often and who fill out this film playing the side characters. They remind me of the North American group that came out of Second City Television we now associate with Christopher Guest movies. They share that sense of humor too, where each of the characters seem to exist in their own orbit but since they all do, they get along fine. Dialog is somewhere between non sequiturs and honest answers when you don't anticipate them. And it's all about timing and delivery. Funny people.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the hairstyles of the two main characters. J Odagiri, famous Average Joe Japanese actor, sports a Bob Dylanesque 'fro, while famous Big Bad Guy actor Tomokazu Miura's cut seems to suffer from some sort of mullet imbalance. They're an odd pair perfectly suited to this low-key oddball comedy.

A thrill for me is the appearance of Yuriko Yoshitaka as Fufumi, the niece of the debt collector's fake wife. She co-starred, at age seventeen, in one of my favorite films of all time, Noriko's Dinner Table, as the younger sister, Yuka. While that Sion Sono film was no where near a comedy, Yuriko Yoshitaka's character possessed a bit of the same surreal comportment that works for her in this film. She's tasked here with playing a loud, extremely happy, self-orientor who likes to put mayonnaise on everything, and pulls it off without being obnoxious. Your mileage may vary but I think she's got a bright future. She seems comfortable acting.",1351641600,5,2210,4.807894736842106

4017921,5,B002ZDMHIS,"This movie is easy to hate. Lots of obscure dialogue and subtle jokes. Characters seem bratty but if you get over that you'll see the philosophical question that is playing out. The lesson at the end of the movie is not spelled out for you so it may seem incomplete but if you think back to how the main characters met and how the story ended, you will see who the real benefactor of that walk through tokyo was.

Cinematically it is beautifully shot, a great depiction of the diversity of the areas and peoples that coexist so close to eachother in most major cities.

If you sometimes feel like you have nothing left to offer the world.. That you didn't do enough of this or that to reach a certain position in your life where you thought you would be able to help the people of the world.. Watch this movie and remember, it doesn't matter what religion or culture you belong to. The first civilizations were not built by the hands, sticks, and stones of one person. A whole community pitched in where they could see they were needed.

4017940,3,B002ZDMHIS,"TENTEN (ADRIFT IN TOKYO / MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE [LIT.]) A Unique Traveling Arrangement!

Rating = ***
Director:  Satoshi Miki
Producers:  Mitsuru Hagiwara et al.
Streaming
2007

Film = barely three (3) stars.  Director Satoshi Miki's depiction of the adventures of a mobile odd couple traipsing about town.  One is a killer (and, perhaps, former loan shark); the other is a  deadbeat (and, perhaps, former) customer now serving as a paid traveling companion of the killer.  This is an open-ended scenario that Director Miki fills with a broad spectrum of denizens--from hookers to a bratty juvenile (played by an actress much too old for the role) to a virtual/pretend wife to a recently-dead real one.  Acting is good (except for the over-ripe juvenile) although character-continuity appearances are sometimes lacking from scene to scene.  Subtitles are fine (perhaps in part due to sparse line readings--characters are usually rather taciturn). Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) is fine and pleasantly mobile.  Interior sets (and their lighting) are very good (all interiors seem to be filmed on-location).  If you love to wander around the very-safe back streets of Tokyo (or are planning to do so on your next trip), this film will likely be of at least casual interest--it's filled with way-off-the-tourist-beaten-path places to explore/revisit.  If not, skip this low-budgeted trifle.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1453075200,,1426,5.422727272727273
4017941,5,B002ZDMHIS,"Agree with another reviewer, definitely reminded me of Wes Anderson, with a touch bit of Scorcese's ""After Hours"" thrown in. Great scenes throughout Tokyo, from the quiet suburbs to the neon-electric Shinjuku. Not as much food porn as you normally get with Japanese movies and dramas, but the silly, random cosplay makes up for it. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1452643200,,354,5.120689655172414
4017942,5,B002ZDMHIS,"It was not what I expected. touching, funny, and a good walk in Tokyo.

4018050,5,B002ZDMHIS,"You'll like this if you like Japan and also if you like those European movies where not much happens and people smoke a lot. The Japanese characters' actions are extremely realistic. In the opening scene, a thug storms into a law student's apartment to threaten him over a debt. The assailant crams his sock in the student's mouth, warns him to pay up, then leaves. Here is the wonderfully Japanese part - on entering and departing, the criminal is careful to remove, then replace his shoes at the threshold.

The characters and the direction were European; more about feelings than about events. Two men with outrageously bad hair walked across Tokyo for several days and nights. The city looked quiet and lonely, just as Woody Allens New York, in his films. Watching it, I missed Tokyo and wanted to go back there to live for a long time.",1409616000,4,840,4.675675675675675
4018051,1,B002ZDMHIS,"Utterly disappointed.  This movie falls under the category of ""oh, looks boring, yet I continue watching hoping to see something, yet nothing happens at the end"".  Reminds of a failed version of Jarmusch-like style of film.  Other than the scene depicted in the movie cover, most of the walks in Tokyo were passable, uninteresting.

4018065,5,B002ZDMHIS,"Overall pretty solid film. The plot is there and has a nice touch of effortlessness as viewers experience through the character's adrift in Tokyo. For those who want to get minds off something, this is a good choice as the film just follow these two main characters walking around Tokyo seemingly without a destination. It does not present popular buildings and areas in Tokyo or give a tour to Tokyo. It's more of a personal level of telling the main characters' private bonds with the city. The actings are also very solid, the main characters effortlessly doing their things in the movie, whether funny, serious, or goofy. But that's a major key of this movie in that it's not a typical drama based movie but rather just tells you vey lightly their story slowly by walking around the city. There are various minor parts of the movie and minor characters that can seem as random. But these minor characters filmed at least one Japanese TV drama at the same time this film was produced with the main actor Jo Odagiri. So for the Japanese viewers, it's kind of funny how these actors and actress also appear in this film with Jo Odagiri. One of the better performance by Jo Odagiri. Finally to summarize this film, one word might be suffice, and that is effortless.",1407024000,3,1265,4.651785714285714

I watched this with my daughter who is not a fan of foreign movies mainly because of the subtitles but she truly enjoyed this story and was glad we watched it together.  You have to admit there are not too many stories you can watch with your daughter but this was one and a great one.

Basically, it's a comedy centered around a couple of dark themes, but along the way it tells some  touching stories about friendship, love and loneliness.

This could be Japan's equivalent to films in the genre of ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.""",1382572800,2,455,4.341176470588235
8384729,5,B002ZDMHIS,"Bizare movie, but I love it. Though the plot is simple, it keeps you asking questions until information about their backstories are more or less vivid by the end of the film.",1527984000,,174,4.46875
8384730,5,B002ZDMHIS,"I enjoyed it a lot.
Aside from the actual plot (which was interesting but overall unimportant), the small encounters and mini-adventures gave the story ""life.""
I can't really recommend the movie to anyone, because the movie wasn't ""entertaining."" That being the case, the writing was well done, filming was amazing, and the main characters were executed perfectly. (The supporting/side characters felt too silly)
Definitely worth your time for something light hearted with profound moments if you care to understand them.",1521936000,,521,5.525
8384731,5,B002ZDMHIS,Sweet peaceful human touching. Highly recommended. The magic and sweetness of ordinary life...found at last,1521590400,,107,6.2
8384732,5,B002ZDMHIS,"A great movie for a quiet evening. This is an offbeat comedy that will have you laughing and the bizarre but also encourages reflection on loneliness, happiness and life's meaning. I've watched this several times and will probably watch it several times more!",1519344000,,259,5.046511627906977
8384733,4,B002ZDMHIS,"Charming flick, similar in spirit to the equally fun A Coffee in Berlin.",1518739200,,72,4.615384615384615
8384734,5,B002ZDMHIS,I've seen this movie four times and I enjoyed it more each time. I usually watch it when I'm feeling a little down. The deliberate thoughtfulness of the writing and characters is interesting and reassuring. The plot is secondary to the characters so any scene in the movie is intriguing on its own. Maybe its just where I'm am in life right now but I think this movie is a bit of a hidden gem.,1517270400,,393,4.253333333333333
8384735,4,B002ZDMHIS,"I'm not sure how best to describe this movie. Serene? Quirky? Indie? However you describe it, this movie about taking a last walk through Tokyo is more about the adventure rather than the destination. Hilarious and bittersweet, this is for fans of dark and offbeat comedy backed by an exceptional cast.
I feel that viewers who were disappointed in this film were expecting something more typical and thus were let down that this movie just wanted to be its own thing. Like life, and the characters in this movie, not everything ends perfect or gets tied together the way you want if at all. If you feel that so many questions were unanswered, that's just life.",1513987200,,660,4.698275862068965
8384736,5,B002ZDMHIS,Funny and interesting movie.,1513555200,,28,6.25
8384737,5,B002ZDMHIS,"I really liked this one because of the oddity of the characters. I got pulled into it in a roundabout way where I felt like I was still trying to figure out the characters and after awhile it seemed it didn't matter as much as the relationship between all the characters. You're left wondering who Fukuhara really was to Takemura, a loan shark, a friend or more than that. A bulk of this cast played together in a comedy drama called Jikou Keisatsu (Statute of Limitations Police) about the same time as this movie. One of the inside jokes in this film was the woman officer (Kumiko Aso) giving a ticket to an illegally parked car was the co-lead in the other drama as a traffic officer.",1504483200,,687,4.417322834645669
