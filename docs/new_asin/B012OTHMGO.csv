7357512,5,B012OTHMGO,I loved this show.  It was hilarious.  Just very sad they didn't go past a second season.,1448928000,6,89,4.176470588235294
7357533,5,B012OTHMGO,One of the best comedy series I have ever seen. I only wish there were more seasons!,1489536000,,84,4.0
7357534,5,B012OTHMGO,"Yes, the Party Down Series DVD met my expectations. It had all the complete episodes included across 4 discs, and menus to access the content. Season 2's menus were more animated. I needed to laugh and this was achieved by watching it. It exceeded my expectations by including a couple special features.",1487030400,,303,4.846153846153846
7357535,3,B012OTHMGO,"I has it's moments and the cast is stellar, but I couldn't really get into it.",1484006400,,78,3.9375
7357536,5,B012OTHMGO,"I loved this show when it aired. Then recently watched the first season on one of the streaming sources. Well, then I had to watch seasons two and three. So glad I ordered this. It was cheap and in perfect condition. I'll probably watch this series once a year it makes me laugh so much.
The writing and acting are superb. Just wish they'd made more seasons!",1475625600,,358,4.358208955223881
7357537,5,B012OTHMGO,"....because you might just laugh it off. Party Down is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen. Not for the squeamish; frequently raunchy, always hysterical. Every cast member shines. And 4 discs for this low price is a steal.",1470096000,,237,4.804878048780488
7357538,5,B012OTHMGO,ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS EVER WRITTEN.... sad that it was so abruptly cancelled. Hidden gem.,1462492800,3,89,4.625
7357539,5,B012OTHMGO,Probably one of the most awesome series ever. I only wish it came in HD! This series is hilarious for anyone who has ever catered and/or anyone who enjoys the comedic stylings of Adam Scott/Lizzy Caplan. Love it.,1461715200,4,212,4.605263157894737
7357540,5,B012OTHMGO,"You should watch this show. But if you haven't already seen this show, then I'm mad at you for not watching it when it was on the air which could have saved it from it's ultimate demise. But you still have a chance for redemption! Watch this show! It's great!",1461024000,2,259,4.2
7357541,5,B012OTHMGO,"One of the funniest shows. Wonderful cast, and excellent writing. Just get this DVD. 2 seasons for this price is a great deal.",1458950400,3,126,4.521739130434782
7357542,2,B012OTHMGO,"The jokes fall as flat as a tray full of stale eclairs. The series is only midly funny, gathering much of its material from gay or homophobic jokes. Even the brilliant comedic actor that is Jane Lynch can't revive the series. As a professional caterer with years of experience, this series falls far short of reality. I know it's a comedy and shouldn't mirror the real life catering experience, but whoever wrote it didn't know much about catering enough to make a mockery of catering situations.",1457049600,,496,4.77906976744186
8726370,5,B012OTHMGO,"Really really good!  Missed this when it came out, they were showing on tv and I watched couple episodes, then saw it was available on DVD and bought it.  The whole show is great!  The actors, the writing, the overall premise, just a lot of laughs, well done!  I'm curious what the people who didn't like this are in to?  It is for adults, I really liked Community, but this was better, if you looking for comparison.  Cheers!",1519948800,,426,4.397435897435898
8726371,5,B012OTHMGO,This is one of my all time favorite shows. I wish they would have made more seasons of it. I got this dvd set for $7.50 which i felt like is a great price for it.,1510617600,,162,3.5277777777777777

8726373,3,B012OTHMGO,"Has funny moments, but for the most part not worth the  money.",1501718400,,62,4.166666666666667

8726379,4,B012OTHMGO,"One of the best comedy series that nobody saw when it aired! The show gets 5 stars, but this is a bare-bones DVD set which had some minor interface (menu) problems, so the set loses a star for that. For under 8 bucks I can't complain, though!",1493942400,,242,4.170212765957447
