I was very happy to see that most, if not all of the movies in this collection are widescreen. This is a great thing, especially for martial arts movies. I was very unhapy to lean, after going through each of the disks, that more than 1/2 of the movies are subtitled and have no english audio track. This wouldn't normally not bother me, but these subs are hard coded into the movie and appear over the actual picture and not in the black area at the bottom of the screen that most movies use. They are very hard to read. I have bad vision and I find myself having to pause or back the video up just to reread lines that I couldn't see the first time.  If not for this, the collection would have been 4 or 5 stars.",1264550400,,865,4.148809523809524
