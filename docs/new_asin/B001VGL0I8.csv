This is an adaption of G. K. Chesterton's short story ""The Blue Cross"" which introduced ""Father Brown"". There was a television series of the ""Father Brown"" stories in British TV in the late 1950s. None have been made available in video recordings.",1329782400,4,2506,4.793981481481482

8346467,3,B001VGL0I8,"We love this movie -- so much that we purchased a region-free DVD player to watch it.  We've seen it often enough to know that several scenes had been cut from this version. Missing scenes include: Father Brown puts on his new glasses & sees that the men who helped him find the optometrist are the two policemen he was running away from; Father Brown talks to an artist painting beside the river;  the French Legionaire talks about marrying a widow on the train. There may have been others, but these especially stood out on our first viewing of the DVD.  The editing was well-done & probably not obvious except to those who know the movie as we do -- but we had expected to receive the entire movie when we purchased the DVD.",1496102400,2,727,4.41044776119403
8346468,5,B001VGL0I8,"Of all the movies Guinness made, and as much as he appreciated them all (although he grew weary of Star Wars), this one had the greatest impact on his life:  it was in filming this movie that the episode occurred that led to his conversion to Catholicism.  Reading his autobiographical journals, particularly Blessings in Disguise, it all comes together in such a lovely package.  I recommend the two side-by-side, as that's how I discovered the movie, myself.  No, it's not completely true to Chesterton; however, Guinness conveys better than anyone else what an unlikely sleuth Fr. Brown is, and the calm serenity that marks his work.",1493596800,,636,4.971698113207547
8346469,3,B001VGL0I8,"The Detective is a worthwhile film, especially for Alec Guinness fans.  He captures rather well the quirky, somewhat otherworldly character of Father Brown - this is in many respects a worthy portrait of a true man of God, misunderstood even, or perhaps especially by the more worldly clerics in authority above him.  The first bit of this film bowls along with plenty of humor and incident, but the film makers rather lose their way as Father Brown seeks to corner the international thief, Flambeau, to save his soul.  The film ends on an up note with some fairly uproarious sight gags.  Overall, worth a look.",1410998400,,611,4.79047619047619
8346470,4,B001VGL0I8,"I was surprised by Alec G's performance; it doesn't hold up very well.  He plays it as a bit of an oaf and it just doesn't work.  Peter Finch is excellent and his performance is stellar, all these years later.  Even Joan Greenwood's performance is still sharp and crisp. So, overall it was worth it, but I was expecting more from Alec G in this good mystery and it just doesn't happen.",1396915200,,385,4.319444444444445
8346471,3,B001VGL0I8,"This film is of historical interest only - far from the best of Alec Guiness, and lacking any of the bite and wit of Chesterton.",1392508800,,128,4.16
8346472,4,B001VGL0I8,"I was once told that when a movie is made from a book, you have to judge each on it's own merits and not compare the two. This is true of this movie. It is hardly true to the short story but is still a delightful movie. We both enjoyed it very much.",1383868800,4,249,3.7169811320754715
8346473,4,B001VGL0I8,"Due to the fact that it is a very old film, it has another tempo.  Nevertheless it was very interesting
and of course the acting is what makes the movie.",1379980800,,153,4.1

8346475,5,B001VGL0I8,"I sometimes daydream that somewhere undisclosed rests a colossal secret vault that holds Region 1 DVDs of cinematic gems that, for this or that reason, have yet to see the light of day. I like to think that 1954's THE DETECTIVE sits in high pile purgatory in that vault. There's a VHS copy out and about, and a Region 2 DVD for them Brits. THE DETECTIVE features one of my very favorite Alec Guinness performances. It's based in huge part on G.K. Chesterton's first Father Brown short story, ""The Blue Cross.""

It's been a bit since I boned up on G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown stories. So I can't rightly recall how faithful Guinness' interpretation is to the source character. This cinematic version is mild-mannered and unpretentious and accomodating, and I'm firm in stating that those traits fit the book version's demeanor. But Guinness' Father Brown is also adept with pickpocketing and he occasionally engages in wrestling matches. What's not been changed is his uncanny insight into the depravity of man.

Father Ignatius Brown is an odd duck. The film opens with the police busting in and there's Father Brown caught in the act. Except that continued observation informs that he's not taking money out of that safe but, rather, putting money BACK in. Father Brown has a certain rep with the bobbies; they know he fancies himself an amateur sleuth. He doesn't stay behind bars too long. See, Father Brown attends to his ongoing mission, that of redeeming lost souls. That safecracker, him what the Father had intercepted earlier, gets a second chance.

The central plot begins when our clerical sleuth learns that the Eucharistic Congress is to convene in Rome and that the invaluable Holy Cross of St. Augustine, currently housed in Father Brown's church, is intended to travel to the site. Here's the rub: the notorious international thief known as ""Monsieur Flambeau"" has proposed to add the cross to his collection. Off goes Father Brown, aiming for the Eternal City, wrapping the cross in a parcel, securing it with twine, eyes on alert for French nogoodniks. Except that no one knows what M. Flambeau looks like. He's a ""human chameleon, a master of disguise."" But never mind that. Huge chunks of the film take place in France, in Flambeau's bailiwick, as he and the unassuming priest soon enough are matching wits.

I grin at those little moments in which Guinness, gleam in his eyes, exhibits Father Brown's perceptiveness. While G.K. Chesterton has written of Brown's investigative style as more intuitive than deductive, Guinness' Brown demonstrates that he's as keenly observant as Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the film, as Brown persists in piercing his adversary's deceptions, a baffled (and impressed) Flambeau would ask how Brown keeps on finding him. There's a sense of viewer gratification as Brown mildly points out Flambeau's mistakes, the first of which hinges on a ham sandwich. An ongoing cat-and-mouse game has quickly developed, but there's no animosity. After all, he's a priest, and he's French.

THE DETECTIVE is a British gem, adeptly executed, smartly written, marvelously comic as only the Brits can do it. That it's an obscure bit of cinema today is a real shame. It's spearheaded by Guinness, who others may say is in rare form except that he's usually this very good and this dialed in and this playful. He's ably supported by a superb cast, especially Peter Finch. How does it end? Does it resolve with an unrepentant sinner or with faith restored? Why would I tell you?",1358812800,10,3512,4.976149914821124
