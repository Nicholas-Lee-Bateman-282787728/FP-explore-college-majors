5409053,5,B00ACF7M2W,"I have several of Patti's books in my library so when I saw this video I just knew I had to have it. I actually purchased both of her video sets. This is an excellent companion to her books. She provides a lot of information not just on the basic construction of cloth dolls but also on face design.  Patti takes the viewer through a step by step process with each face she creates using several different mediums. She offers many tips and techniques on hair, clothing and general embellishing to add that extra zing to your doll. The viewer will see her beading, fabric painting and dying techniques. Patti includes many amazing dolls from a variety of dollmakers as inspiration for the viewer.  Watching this was like having my best dollmaker friend right in the studio with me! This would be a great resource for any dollmaker from beginner to advanced.  There was one disappointment - the camera shots could have been better when Patti would point out a small detail on a finished doll.",1364860800,,990,4.613636363636363
5409054,5,B00ACF7M2W,"This second DVD in the collection from Patti Culea and Studio Galli continues where the first DVD left off, with imaginative costuming ideas.  This DVD has lots of great and achievable costuming ideas from Patti.  If you can't make it to an in-person doll making class this DVD is the next best thing and in some ways, is even better because you can stop, and go back if you missed anything, which you can't do in a class.  Unlike some art and craft instructional DVDs, both this and Patti's first DVD with Studio Galli have beautiful clear visuals and high quality audio so you can see and hear exactly what Patti is doing every step of the way.  If you think costuming is intimidating, this is the inspirational DVD you need to see that you can do costuming and do it beautifully.",1364342400,3,782,4.485915492957746

8549988,5,B00ACF7M2W,This DVD is great.  I wish  Patti could have made it longer with more detail.  There are some things I would have liked such as closer pictures of what she was doing.  A must for any doll maker.  Especially fairy doll makers,1432684800,,224,4.238095238095238

8549993,5,B00ACF7M2W,"I own everything Patti Culea has done (just about). I have all her books and now both of her videos. Because of her, I have found doll making and I have taught it to several people using her techniques. She is a wonderful mentor in my opinion. I cannot wait for her next project to be released (whatever that may be). If you love to sew and want to do more than just make clothes for humans or if you do a little craft sewing and want to venture further but do not know where to get started, this is the video for you.",1369440000,2,518,3.9903846153846154
8549994,5,B00ACF7M2W,"This video continues to inspire, just as the first one did. Patti leads us through her process of costuming and draping fabric to clothe your doll. You'll soon be flying solo, inspired by Patti's easy methods of draping and pattern making. The face painting techniques add new ways of using products like watercolors to your skill set. It's a great look inside Patti's world, at her techniques, her process and her inspirations. I'm inspired!",1365552000,3,442,4.986486486486487
