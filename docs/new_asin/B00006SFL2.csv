7973296,3,B00006SFL2,"Gaylord's short film revolves around the life of a Jewish gay teenager who lives with his somewhat invasive and talkative mother. She calls him Boychick all the time, and she's convinced every time his son is in his room he's indulging into masturbatory practices. In fact, during the first minutes she jokes with him pinching his butt and assuring him, quite loudly, that ""it's OK to masturbate in your room"". So loud does she speak, in fact, that the neighbors and a few bystanders are witnesses to the scene.

Although it's a rather succinct story, ""Boychick"" displays the most lovely characters one could create in such a short span of time, it has very humorous moments and one can easily laugh at the embarrassing and awkward situations the shy and chubby protagonist experiences.

Boychick daydreams all the time about a famous pop star, who not unlike Pinocchio's fairy, grants him a glance into his innermost desires, and what's more important, a possible way to reach them and enough courage to embark upon a vital journey. Contrary to what his mother believes, sexual activities in Boychick are actually sublimated by his daydreaming. As Jacques Lacan would say, guilt comes when one gives up on one's desire; id est, not fulfilling one's desire. From the first scenes it's made clear that Boychick admires and desires the body of one of his classmates, a blonde and attractive boy, but all he can do is stare at him, and sadly realize some guys are just out of his league.

How, then, can one overcome guilty? By taking care of that which sparked our desire in the first place. That's why, without spoiling the final scene, at the end Boychick resolves one of his most serious conflicts. Albeit briefly, his desire and his actions no longer transit on divergent paths.",1318723200,,1780,4.829508196721312
7973297,1,B00006SFL2,"Sorry...five short films -- all either are, or seem like, student films...I'm sure these guys graduated -- everything is lit, the editing is orderly, the shots aren't sideways or misframed -- but that doesn't mean the films are worth seeing.  Mostly terrible/dull.  The best is just ""okay"".
Obviously trading on the idea that gay men will watch anything that is gay themed.  But there's nowhere NEAR enough sex or nudity or cute boys to make it worth helping to prove that point.
The only amusing part is that the DVD actually contains director commentary tracks, like we need to hear stuff like ""this was really shot in my friend Jon's apartment"" or ""Okay, that neighbor woman is actually my sister, who volunteered to be in the film. She's really nice...""",1084579200,5,757,4.8076923076923075
7973298,3,B00006SFL2,"It is just too bad that most short film compilations contain wide variance in quality. This selection is no better nor worse than most of the others. It seems the more shorts in a collection , the greater chance for mediocrity. But then this makes the gems pop out even brighter. This is definitely a collection worth seeing, even though some of the films are a little too long for short films. Of course, what constitutes good or bad is very subjective. For me, the short Boychick is probably the most charming of the bunch, and in a very short time with relatively little dialogue it can disarm the viewer. At the opposite end is the self-indulgent Rainbow Avenger. The rest fall somewhere in between. But don't take my word for it; get this collection if you collect gay films, or at least try to rent it. It is pretty much a miracle to get a gay film made and distributed, so show your support. And you're bound to find something to your liking.",1041465600,12,949,4.459770114942529
7973299,4,B00006SFL2,"""Boxer Shorts"" is a compilation of five award winning gay-oriented films.  They last from twelve to twenty-eight minutes each, and all have a director's commentary track.  As an extra bonus there is an eight-minute black & white film without commentary.
Despite the title, there is nothing on boxing or on boxer shorts per se.  The picture on the front is not taken from the movies.  The description and photos on the back of the box are representative, although the images are sharper in the films.
All five feature films have interesting stories.  The acting and production values are more variable, but still acceptable overall.  There were skin shots in all five.
1. ""Tom Clay Jesus"" by Hoang A. Duong won prizes at the Berlin Film Festival and Sundance.  The film looks at a New York area tryst-romance from three perspectives.  People want to be loved for themselves, whatever that might mean.  This was my favorite.
2. ""Boychick"" by Glenn Gaylord was a Seattle International Film Festival winner.  A Jewish high-school student in Los Angeles recruits his dream female celebrity performer to help him win the attention of the buff debate team champion.  There is a long end credit section that tells ""where they are now"".
3. ""Audit"" by Brian To won at Win Femme Film Festival.  A married couple show up at an IRS audit in Los Angeles to explain how they have so many expenses and so little revenue. Guess what?  The auditor has figured out even more.  This was the longest and best acted film, with Alexis Arquette as the auditor and Sally Kirkland as an interested auditor lurking in the wings.  There were many twists and subtleties.
4. ""The Prom Queen"" by Sean Patrick McCarthy won at the Hamptons International Film Festival.  A drag-wearing high-schooler (north of New York City) tricks with the jock who will escort the ambitious prom queen.  Who will enjoy This prom?
5. ""Caught"" by Christopher Gotschall was called a festival favorite on the box and deserves it as the closer.  A Chicago area photographer/cleaner falls for a pre-med who already has a relationship with a somewhat older man.  Actions, confessions, and what else can happen?
6. ""The Rainbow Avenger"" by David Hayes is a black & white silent short film in the Extra Features section and is without commentary.  A heavy gay man becomes a superhero but is not ready to face the consequences.
The average quality and inspiration level are higher than is usual in these anthologies.",1039478400,28,2457,4.860576923076923
