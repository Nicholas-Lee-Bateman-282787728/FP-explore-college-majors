5092615,3,B007K7IBAW,"""Rage In Heaven""
(MGM, 1941)

One of a slew of wonderful recent re-releases of less well-known movies from the 1930s and '40s, this features a young, drop-dead gorgeous Ingrid Bergman as the faithful but ultimately terrified wife of a paranoid sociopath, played by Robert Montgomery. His portrayal of a madman is a bit stiff and remote -- I think many viewers will have as hard a time getting into his character as he did, since his performances is all surface and little subtext. The script is very talky and melodramatic, with clunky plot points and fairly flat direction, but it's fun nonetheless, in a campy, old-fashioned Douglas-Sirk-meets-Alfred-Hitchcock kind of way. This film probably won't enter on your ""greatest films ever!"" list, but fans of the era will appreciate its feel and tone, particularly viewers in search of ""new"" old movies to watch... Plus, if you're like me, you's be happy to watch Ingrid Bergman in just about anything. Kudos to Warner Brothers for making these rare old films available again after many decades in the vaults... Wish I could watch them all! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1364947200,6,1126,4.98936170212766

5092617,5,B007K7IBAW,"This is one of the few movies where George Sanders is the romantic lead. And he was yummy but a dummy. George Montgomery is superb as the psychopath and Ingrid Bergman is her usual stunning self...though a bit on the stupid side.

The movie was the perfect length and I had seen it on Turner Classic Movies several years ago, and I just waited for Amazon to sell it.  Thrilled to finally own it...""my precious""...it lived up to the movie I had seen.

It is a totally satisfactory murder, suspense drama, and is well worth the watch!

Thank you Amazon.com for selling it.",1346976000,10,570,4.504854368932039
5092618,3,B007K7IBAW,"This promising but ultimately disappointing melodrama from author James Hilton (""Goodbye Mr. Chips"") stars a very young and lovely Ingrid Bergman as a naive European refugee who impulsively marries a disturbed playboy (Robert Montgomery). Full of self-loathing and psychotic, he accuses Bergman of fooling around with his best friend (George Saunders) and plots their demise.

This could have been a fast-paced, Hitchockian thriller, but unfortunately it falls flat. Bergman is lovely to look at but the film was marred by poor direction and a zombie-like performance by Robert Montgomery (who did a much better impersonation of a psychotic in ""Night Must Fall""). His acting is so wooden and flat that it almost ruins the film - fortunately Bergman's histrionics provide a measure of tension the story badly needs. This role foreshadows her Oscar-winning role in ""Gaslight"", with George Saunders (!) playing the Joseph Cotton role.",1337817600,5,931,5.4206896551724135

8518759,4,B007K7IBAW,"After reading some Amazon reviews my expectations were not so high but I was into this film all the way and liked the plot twists even though they were sometimes a stretch.  I think it is one of the more worthy and entertaining films of its era.  Also, given the character he needed to play, I thought Robert Montgomery did a very decent job.",1517270400,,342,4.328125

I'm not happy about it. But it was a Christmas gift from someone I love, so I'm not going to return in. I was able to finish it with no further problems. Great movie.",1420156800,,332,4.123076923076923

8518766,5,B007K7IBAW,Robert Montgomery really shows his 'range' here; as a mental paranoid character!  He is fantastic in this; and very believable! George Sanders is great as his friend. Love Ingrid! Haven't had this movie very long and have already watched it 3 times; it is a great movie...hate to review movies because I don't want to give away the plot!  Highly recommend!,1370736000,6,356,4.819672131147541
