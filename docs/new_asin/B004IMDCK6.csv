4387017,5,B004IMDCK6,"This 1923 Buster Keaton feature has a little something for everyone, historical accuracy, scenic beauty, great story, amazing visual humor and breathtakingly dangerous stunts.

The prologue begins in rural Kentucky in the year 1810.  The wealthy Canfield family, and the poor McKay family, are locked in a generational feud.  When a Canfield brother and the lone patriarch of the McKay family are killed on a rainy night, the Canfields swear revenge, while the McKay widow flees with her baby son Willie to avoid any more bloodshed.

Twenty years pass by, and Willie McKay (Buster Keaton) is now a grown man, who was raised by his aunt after his mother passed away. He is sent a letter by an attorney telling him that he needs to travel to Kentucky to claim his father's estate.  Imagining that the estate is a big, Southern plantation, Willie decides to make the trip.  His aunt tells him about the feud, and makes him promise her that he will stay away from the Canfields

While on the long train journey (the train was a rebuilt replica of Stevenson's Rocket engine), Willie rides in the same coach with a pretty young lady (Natalie Talmadge)  that he becomes sweet on.  He is blissfully unaware that she is Canfield, and she doesn't know he is a McKay, and ends up inviting him over to her house for supper.  When her father (Big Joe Roberts) and brother's find out who he is, they do what they can to try and kill him.  Being Southern gentlemen, however, it was against their honor code to kill Willie while he was a guest in their home.  Once young McKay figured out what was going on, he decided to become a permanent house guest.

There is much more that happens, but I am not one for giving away spoilers.  There are some thrilling water stunts in this film that were not only dangerous, but  were almost fatal for Keaton, who of all the comedians of his time, did more dangerous water stunts than any of them.

There was a scene where Buster was in a raging river.  The cameras were set at the water's edge.  The cameramen were never allowed to stop shooting unless Buster yelled, ""Cut"" first.  They had a hold back wire attached to Buster, so he would travel down the river at the same rate of speed that the camera was going.  In the film, you can see where the wire snapped, and Buster is violently carried off by the water, over the rocks and through the rapids.  He managed to get to the edge to hold onto a branch, and that was the only thing that saved him from drowning.  Another dangerous stunt was when he had to rescue Natalie's character before she is swept over the falls herself.  He inhaled so much water during the stunt that a doctor had to administer first aid.

This film was a family affair for Keaton.  Buster's infant son plays baby Willie McKay in the prologue.  His first wife, Natalie Talmadge, was his leading lady (She was also pregnant with their second son at that time), and his father, Joe Keaton, also had a small role.  Sadly, long time friend and actor Joe Roberts, who played the Canfield patriarch and many of the heavies in Keaton's short films, died of a stroke shortly after this film wrapped.

Although Our Hospitality was not as well known as his later works, it is definitely a well made, fast paced, comedy thriller that is a small glimpse into  Buster Keaton's future greatness.",1384819200,,3332,4.543624161073826
4387018,4,B004IMDCK6,This is a great Keaton film which all of his admirers are sure to enjoy. I recommend to Keaton fans.,1384300800,,100,4.05
4387019,5,B004IMDCK6,"Our Hospitality (1923) was Buster Keaton`s first true feature film. Keaton's previous ""feature,"" Three Ages (1923) was actually three short films assembled together. There was both an artistic and a commercial reason for this: Three Ages was a parody of the similarly structured D.W. Griffith feature Intolerance (1916). Additionally, Keaton had proved his audience appeal in shorts. Metro Pictures realized the inherent risk of a Keaton feature, and the structure of Three Ages created the option of breaking it down into three shorts. Fortunately for all concerned, Three Ages was a commercial and critical success.

Our Hospitality may be seen, in retrospect, as a model for Keaton's features and a precursor to The General (1926). What separates Keaton from his peers (Chaplin, Lloyd, Langdon) is the way his character integrates into a larger narrative. That is not to say that Keaton's films are not character driven, but the character serves the narrative, not vice versa.

Our Hospitality opens with a prologue of the ongoing feud between the Canfields and the McKays. A young Canfield and the McKay patriarch are killed in a rainy shoot out at night. To avoid the curse of the feud and further bloodshed, the McKay widow takes her infant son, Willie, and sends him north to New York. Meanwhile, the Canfields swear revenge.

Twenty years later, Willie (Keaton) is the personification of a 19th century New York Yankee, adorned in a dandified suit. His mother has since passed away when Willie learns he has inherited his father's estate. Imagining a southern mansion waiting in the wings, Willie hops onto the next train like a salmon returning to its birthplace. Before departing, he is warned by his guardian to stay clear of the Canfields.

The trip south foreshadows the archaic world Willie is about to enter. The train itself is primitive and, naturally, encounters numerous mishaps along the way. Luckily for Willie, the ordeal is made bearable because his fellow passenger is a pretty girl (Natalie Talmadge, the first Mrs. Keaton). Unfortunately, Willie's spawning choice here, unknown to him, is a Canfield daughter.

There are numerous aquatic metaphors. Willie stands apart from his fellows, like a fish out of water, with city clicker suit and queer umbrella. While fishing, he catches a minnow, throws it back, and then gets pulled into the water by a bigger fish. Willie's mansion turns out to be a dilapidated shack and he unwittingly finds himself in the home of his sworn enemies. True to Southern hospitality, the Canfields vow not kill Willie while he is a guest in their home. When Willie learns of this, he naturally tries to remain a permanent houseguest. Almost forced out, Willie is saved from leaving by the sudden appearance of a heavy downpour. A dam blows up, nearly drowning Willie, but it also safely conceals Willie from his predators, the Canfield boys. In a reversal of the fishing line, Willie is tied, by rope, to a Canfield son. Both get hauled into the water. A descent into the rapids brings further peril, as does a waterfall. Willie dangles over the waterfall like that salmon on a line. Yet, it is the waterfall which unites Willie with his girl, allowing him to spawn.

Our Hospitality is replete with inventive sight gags (a tunnel is cut to fit the train, a horse's rear-end is disguised as Willie in drag), but it's really a sophisticated, yet simple retelling of the Romeo and Juliet narrative.

4387020,5,B004IMDCK6,"This is great film! Clever and imaginative, featuring wonderful sight gags and stunts that astonish and confound the imagination.  Be careful not to pre-judge this edition from the version now available on Netflix streaming that used to have the same music. That music may be more contemporaneous with 1923, but is barely adequate compared with the music here. Written by Carl Davis, the score fulfils the potential of Our Hospitality to be a wondrous experience to treasure and to share!",1363824000,2,488,5.1
4387021,5,B004IMDCK6,"This new Blu-ray release boasts COLOR TINTS which enhance the experience of watching the movie.  Especially in the cabin scene which is tinted Amber until the lights get turned out, the the tint switches to Blue.

The picture is very slightly trimmed at the bottom, the old DVD had a little more picture, so this indicates that it is a new film transfer. But outside of the slight trimming and color tints, this looks like the same transfer as the old DVD.
I really was hoping to see more details in the outdoor scenes.  It is not a bad transfer, just not as sharp as I had hoped.  The Blu-ray case clearly states that this is 1080i, not 1080p as is the standard format today.

The English Titles & dialogue cards show much more negative damage (scratches & flairs) than the actual movie that this leads me to believe that the bulk of the film came from a cleaner foreign Nitrate negative and the English titles came from a worn U.S. negative.  Just speculation here.

The real selling point here is the new bonus material that was not on the old DVD!
There is a shorter alternate version of the movie, running just 49 minutes. It is in rather poor shape, but well worth the inclusion for comparison into the production process of the film.
Another new welcome addition is a 1925 19 minute short subject called ""The Iron Mule"".
Then we have the much wanted documentary on the making of the film.

Final thoughts: I am not sorry for upgrading to the new Blu-ray transfer, but I had higher hopes based on the sharp transfer of ""The General"".  Still, it looks good and the tints add to the ambiance.",1355356800,2,1596,4.475862068965517
4387022,5,B004IMDCK6,There are two comic actors whose films almost always automatically rate 5 stars  in my opinion & they are Danny Kaye & Buster Keaton. But no one is better at what he did then Keaton. He did all his own stunts & some of them - like the waterfall scene in thie film - were dangerous. He was a true genius.,1347580800,,303,3.9672131147540983
4387023,5,B004IMDCK6,"The picture quality of this film is superb, even better for that it is in HD. The Carl Davis score creates such a beautiful and climatic mood which this film requires. The extras are fantastic and the the film itself I have always enjoyed, but now with the Carl Davis score and the beautiful way it has been presented now shoots up amongst my favourite Keaton movies.",1320451200,7,367,4.492537313432836
4387024,4,B004IMDCK6,"For some reason this film is less well-known than a lot of Buster Keaton's others...yet I find it a lot more satisfying than something like Steamboat Bill, Jr. or even Sherlock Jr.! It's got his fixation with trains in the first act, a very fun depiction of old narrow-gauge trains that, like most historical depictions in Keaton films, is based on actual accurate history (exaggerated for comic effect). It's got great comedy and suspense in the main plot, which involves Buster inadvertently stumbling into the home of a family, after falling for the girl who lives there, who are the Hatfields to his family's McCoys (or is that the other way around?), and relying on the family's strict Southern Hospitality rules to keep himself from being shot. Of course, if you know much about Keaton you probably already know this film, but if you've just seen a little, this is one of his best.

As for the Blu-Ray: the main musical option is the Thames Silents score by Carl Davis. This alone is reason to get this edition...his scores for this, Keaton's The General, and other silent era films are among the best...fun, tuneful, entirely appropriate yet exciting and never falling into hackneyed contrivances. The transfer is decent...a little more money might have allowed cleaning up the title cards, where the tiny and dense scratches of this print (not as pristine as the one used for Kino's The General Blu-Ray) are very obvious and kind of distracting over the black title card backgrounds. But luckily they don't really show up much in the actual scenes. The transfer is at 1080i - from reading around online that seems to be because this HD transfer was done a few years back before they'd decided 1080p was the way to go for releases, not for any reasons relating to frame rate or anything like that. But again, I'm sure money wouldn't allow a new HD transfer, and I doubt anyone could tell by watching it that it wasn't 1080p...it looks fine to me.

The extras are interesting and worth watching. One extra that needs a slight disclaimer is the unreleased earlier test version, ""Hospitality,"" which seems to be a test cut with mostly just the dramatic scenes, speculation being that Keaton wanted to see if they played before adding in the funny business. It's a nice historical artifact to have, but the print is a very poor reduction print of an original which had suffered major nitrate damage. So, it's historically of interest and I'm glad it's on here, but it would take a fairly obsessed Keaton fan to actually watch more than a few minutes of it.

So: if you are at all a fan of Keaton, or of silent comedy in general, or you think you might be, make sure to snap this up and help assure that the rest of Keaton's library is financially worth putting out in HD! I keep mentioning finances, but silents aren't exactly big sellers, so you take what you can get, and overall this is a great release! If only some Spielberg-type would spend a couple bucks and pay for a fancy restoration/clean-up of one of these historic and still-entertaining films. Oh well.

PS: Yes, silent films can look great in HD! Film's resolution, even back then, was/is much higher than 1080p. This print isn't as wonderful as the one used for The General, but it's still quite an improvement over previous versions and is worth seeing in HD. Plus, Keaton (and other silent era filmmakers) worked in a purely visual medium - seeing a detailed, quality image is definitely worth it!",1302739200,33,3468,4.7084019769357495
4387025,5,B004IMDCK6,"I love Keaton's silent films, and this one is terrific in its wry humor.

Shot in the Lake Tahoe area, the film has a pictorial beauty and authenticity that would influence directors ranging from John Ford to Orson Welles. Buster's dangerous stunt work remains one of the great natural wonders.

4387031,5,B004IMDCK6,"Whereas, I can usually say that the last Keaton movie I watched is my favorite, this is my true favorite (with Steamboat Bill, Jr a close 2nd).  The print quality is generally excellent.
  My only problem with the presentation is the score.  I haven't heard a good score for this yet, and am hopeful that some composer will someday get to the soul of this film.  Circus style music and steam calliopes do not belong in a Keaton movie.
  Keaton is generally accessible to modern audiences, if you can get someone to sit for a silent film, although I did have to explain to a few people that in this film,  if Keaton leaves the home, he is a target.
  I've accentuated ""Action"" in the title.  Once the action starts, we have one of the greatest prolonged sequences in cinema history, as Keaton deals with cliffs, high  diving, train fights, whitewater, and a waterfall.  The stunts are gaspingly amazing.  The technical merits, incredible.
  Much of the comedy of the film is subtle, amusing, thought provoking, less laugh out loud than in the shorts.  But the scenes of the train employees with heroic postures, the onlookers, the moving rails.....all stick with me.  Not hilarious, but amusing, and great.
  Here's hoping that this film will endure as long as films are watched.

  The short feature on the making off the film is highly entertaining, as well.",1422748800,2,1359,4.713675213675214
4387032,5,B004IMDCK6,One of his best during the early years of silent films. Well worth watching for all the live action and stunts performed by Keaton.,1403913600,,131,4.5
4387033,5,B004IMDCK6,"Buster Keaton's first feature-length film to tell a complete and continuous story, Our Hospitality was inspired by the Hatfield and McCoy feud of the 1860s-70s. In this film the antagonists are the ""Canfields"" and the ""McKays"", and the time period is the early 1800s. The time shift allowed Keaton to use two technological facts of the era, namely the arrival of the earliest railroads and the use of pistols that required reloading after every shot. Keaton's previous film, Three Ages, was produced in 1923, the same year as Our Hospitality. Three Ages was purposely stitched together from three short films so that they could be sold separately if the feature-length version was not successful. In Our Hospitality, Keaton first reached the level of inventiveness, artistic control, and technological boldness that was to mark his films for the next five years, until the sound age rendered almost all of the great silent comedians more or less obsolete. In this brief time Keaton created some of the finest comedies ever produced.

A major and recurring feature of Our Hospitality is an antique railroad train, built specifically for this production. The engine is based on a British design from 1829, while the ""carriages"" were based on an American example from 1831. You never saw such a railroad, where the tracks can be pulled aside to get around a stubborn burro, or go up and over a fallen tree. The stalwart engineer of this railroad is Joe Keaton, Buster's father. After departing New York, once safely arrived in Kentucky young Willie McKay (Keaton) finds himself in the midst of a decades-old feud. Invited to dinner by a girl he befriended on the train, Willie finds that she, her father and her brothers are Canfields, sworn enemies of the McKays. The men are determined to kill Willie at the earliest opportunity, but ""our hospitality"" will not permit killing him while he is a guest in their house.

The ensuing chases and adventures involve diving into a deep lake (likely Lake Tahoe), being swept down a swift river (the Truckee River, near Lake Tahoe), and over a waterfall. Although the waterfall is a constructed set, it is still 30 feet high, and Keaton does his strenuous and difficult stunts at this height. The care and thought that went into this film are indicated by the meticulous costumes and sets, as well as the intricate and expensive props. Although Keaton had a long apprenticeship in vaudeville and short films, it appeared to the audiences of 1923 that his genius had exploded onto the screen fully developed in Our Hospitality. Over the next five years the sets in his films got larger, the stunts more outrageous and dangerous, and Keaton's fame soared along with the cost of his films.

Extras in this Kino edition of Our Hospitality include a documentary on the making of the film; and an alternate 49-minute cut entitled simply ""Hospitality"" which is thought to be a working copy, missing many of the comic elements that were in the longer version. Also included is a 19 minute film entitled ""The Iron Mule"". Produced in 1925 by Keaton's mentor Fatty Arbuckle, this film utilizes the antique train from Our Hospitality, and Keaton appears in at least one and perhaps as many as four cameos.

(The following paragraph contains observations about Keaton that I attach to all of my reviews of his films.) Charlie Chaplin was the graceful mime, Harold Lloyd was the surprisingly athletic everyman, and Buster Keaton was The Great Stone Face. His expression never varied, but his acrobat's body performed the most astounding knockabout comedy and genuinely dangerous stunts in cinema. Other stars had stunt doubles, but Keaton not only performed his own stunts, he sometimes did the stunts for other actors in his films as well. With the advent of sound Keaton's star faded, but has returned to full brilliance since his death, as restored versions of his films have become available for home video. One of Hollywood's true originals and a genius of motion picture inventiveness, Buster Keaton has secured a place of honor in the history of film, and in the hearts of his growing number of fans.",1400371200,,4132,4.923959827833572
4387034,5,B004IMDCK6,"how i love this movie!  the plot is ingenious and the gags are first rate, especially the justly famous rescue of the herione at the edge of a waterfall.  all of buster's leading ladies were--by design--a little dim, which added so much to the comedy, and this one is no exception, but the fact that she is played by his real wife, natalie talmadge, lends it a strange dynamic since you know their marriage ended very unhappily.  i believe she went so far as to legally change their 2 son's last names after the divorce!!!!!!!!  her air of  beauty/humorlessness works well for the film, but if in life she found this magic, wonderful comic unfunny, what agony that must have been for him. i heard an interview with orson welles taped by peter bogdonovich where he said he thought buster keaton may have been the most beautiful man to ever appear before the camera, and at first that may seem like a strange statement, but the longer i look at him, i think i agree!",1394928000,,964,4.485714285714286

Editors have deleted the card seen in shorter versions of ""Mule"" which show the Arbuckle film as being titled ""Twenty Cent Limited,"" of which older viewers would get the joke. For ""Our Hospitality,"" print quality varies in certain parts (most noticeable after the starting titles, which seem to be, at least in part, mint quality reworks of original titles.
