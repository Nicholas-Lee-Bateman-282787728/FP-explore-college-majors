3039381,5,B000ZED6W0,"After having reviewed the grade 1 -7 math tutor this is the next step in my relearning of Math. If you have a student who is just not ""getting it,"" then Jason is your man. I never had a teacher explain things in such a logical and precise way. This is taught in a very relaxed manner and the student is reassured that it is not hard to do. I always felt like the idiot in Math but now feel I have a good grasp of it. This DVD is being passed on to my nephew who is just finishing the grade 1 -7 and his grades are climbing by each test in school. I can not thank you enough Jason!

8235353,5,B000ZED6W0,This was exactly what I was looking for to help teach my 9 year old grandchild.  We both sit and watch and come up with answers before they are given.  I like how the subject explains and teaches that even ones that have a hard time understanding can grasp how problems are solved.  Thank you so much for ending a nightmare of struggles with homework.,1394841600,,351,4.369230769230769

8235355,5,B000ZED6W0,"I took a test a test to work as a teacher's assistant with our public school system.  I needed a ""3"" out of ""6"" in the mathematics category to be able to be hired.  I hadn't studied math in 18 years. I went through these lesson as well as the algebra lessons and I scored a ""5"" on the mathematics testing for my new job.  Then my husband studied with this because he had to take a basic math test for his new job.  He got a perfect score and the new job.  Now the kids, ages 21, 13, 10, and 7 are all using it to get a better understanding of math. Thanks so much!!! Quality product for a very reasonable price.",1379721600,9,611,3.934959349593496
