8284866,4,B001BTZV6C,"These Serbian Beatles fans got together to play music and take their minds away from the suffering around them during the war torn 1990's.  Their leader is a talented songwriter and arranger.  There is a debate where he wants their second album to sound very much like the first, while another band member (who I lean towards) wants it to sound more like the Beatles might sound a few years later.",1379980800,,397,4.577464788732394
8284867,3,B001BTZV6C,"The Rubber Soul Project stands as one of the most unexpected expressions of Beatlemania. A couple of Serbians (Rastko Ciric & Goran Skrobonja) were fascinated by the idea that while a title track for the Beatles' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rubber-Soul/dp/B0025KVLT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rubber Soul</a>"" album existed, it did not appear on the album. Speculation and imagination led to what the song could have been and that became the foundation of an entire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/imaginary-album/dp/B0015NQBF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">imaginary album</a>&nbsp;of like-minded material. As it turns out, the band has a remarkable ability to write, sing and play like the Fab Four. To capture the Beatles' sound, the group even did what they could to reproduce studio conditions and play the exact models of instruments. For some listeners, this project delivers what sounds like unearthed, lost  Beatles songs. The film succeeds in documenting the history of the Rubber Soul Project (RSP) through interviews, studio sessions, live material and musical videos. As artists with heart, the film sheds light onto what it means to be a Serbian bohemian. Bonus features include computer generated videos for four songs. Despite these merits, the film has some issues. The first of which is that while the RSP is an interesting story that deserves to be told, it's a narrative that probably doesn't need an entire hour. Second, the film could have been done better. While ""Rubber Soul Project"" is filled with genuinely creative cinematic devices, the production quality is as a whole, mediocre. The early generation computer animation hasn't aged well. Beyond this, the entire film is spoken in Serbian while the subtitles stubbornly show dollar signs for apostrophes. RSP seems to inspire acclaim or contempt from Beatles fans. Regardless of one's feelings about whether the group is compelling or not, ""Rubber Soul Project"" is an interesting albeit flawed film about one of the most curious Beatles off-shoots.",1327795200,,2110,5.895424836601308
