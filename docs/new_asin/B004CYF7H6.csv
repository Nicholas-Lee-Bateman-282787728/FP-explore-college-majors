I would recommend it!!",1363910400,,114,4.476190476190476
4330112,5,B004CYF7H6,"Great, can never get enough Rodney Dangerfield , but would of loved to see the whole show.
I thought that was what I paid for.",1355184000,,126,4.08
4330113,1,B004CYF7H6,Don't bother to buy this DVD to see Doris Day.  She only seems to be on for about 5 min.,1293235200,12,88,3.4
4330114,1,B004CYF7H6,"I read in some book that Doris Day was not happy with her appearance on the Johnny Carson Show -- and frankly after seeing this, what a waste of Doris Day's time to appear on the Carson show.  When Rodney Dangerfield gets the majority of the time and Doris gets only a few minutes of the show's time -- what the heck is going on?  A really missed opportunity for a rare interview with Doris Day.  One almost feels that perhaps the chemistry wasn't going well between Johnny and Doris, so he turned to Dangerfield.  For Doris Day fans, do not buy because it wasted monies.",1292544000,13,571,4.3584905660377355

8423887,5,B004CYF7H6,"Heeeeeere's Johnny!

What can I say, I grew up with Carson and watching these old videos take me back to my childhood.  Watched him until his final show.  None of the late night shows even come close to the entertainment value these shows provided nightly.",1431388800,,256,4.644444444444445

8423891,5,B004CYF7H6,"America's Sweetheart has a banging body and she showed it off as Doris Day did not wear a bra on this show!  Besides that she and Johnny have a good relationship as they trade jokes and stories.  I am not sure why she did the show, she did not promote anything in particular.

This is a must watch for any of Doris' fans.",1399248000,2,321,4.063492063492063
8423892,1,B004CYF7H6,"Unfortunately, the Doris Day interview was edited, basically the 2nd part (after the commercial break) of it was missing. This should not have happened...",1395273600,4,154,5.458333333333333
8423893,5,B004CYF7H6,"I know this may sound weird, but I like to start watching my Johnny Carson Episodes at exactly 11:35 PM because that is the time it used to come on in my area. I still enjoy hearing the intro music right before Ed goes Hereeeeeeee's Johnny! So thanks to Amazon I'm able to travel back 20 years in time, anytime I want.",1386547200,,318,4.145161290322581
8423894,3,B004CYF7H6,"I bought this video, as I didn't ever recall Doris Day being on Johnny Carson.  That segment was not worth the money spent to watch her.",1384732800,,136,4.230769230769231
