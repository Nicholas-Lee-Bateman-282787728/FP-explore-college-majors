The kids fidgeted a bit naturally, but I think they got so much out of the two different ""Footprints of God"" DVDs we watched. This is so well done. There is often art included to illustrate the Bible stories, of course. But also Stephen K Ray is cantering up the the camera on an Arabian horse in front of the pyramids, he's at all the real locations, here are the ruins, he's waist-deep in the Nile among the reeds, he's riding up the real mountain at nighttime on a camel to watch the sunrise up on the top, he has real artifacts pertaining to the Bible stories, it is very dynamic. He tells the story in enough detail, at the right pace, and with the right amount of repetition sometimes, to make this great for teaching most age groups. What really makes it stellar, though, is he teaches very well the ""types"" in these Old Testament stories that prefigure Christ, and teaches a lot about the Sacraments in the process. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of Baptism, the manna is a type of the Eucharist, etc. It does a good job teaching Catholic truth. A woman who was interested in watching it at home and knows Steve K Ray is a convert asked me if it says anything negative about protestantism since this is something that sets her protestant husband off, the answer is no, it's very positive and lovely. I highly recommend the Footprints of God series.",1391299200,2,1538,4.4
8172884,1,B000MV8JH8,"On the one hand this film is has great information and some very instructive lectures and wonderful scenes of the Holy Land,
HOWEVER
if this movie were to be rated it would probably receive a pg 13 rating because of some of the art which is also included.  The film switches between Steve Ray talking in the Holy Land and shots of hand drawn art, some of it classic and some of it cartoon, which was obviously made for the movie.  Some of the art shows woman's breasts about four or five times, or breastfeeding their children. Some of pictures the woman in question is in the background but there were at least two pictures where that was not the case; although none of them were photos still I was VERY disappointed in the lack of modesty.  On account of these pictures I cannot show this film to my middle school Bible class because I know how easily young men are effected by this material.  Because of this content BEWARE.",1380585600,,927,4.435294117647059

8172886,5,B000MV8JH8,I've enjoyed each DVD I've bought in this series. I just wish the entire interview with Rosalind Moss was included without having to track down another DVD.,1214179200,2,156,4.814814814814815
