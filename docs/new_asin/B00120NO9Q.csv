8243329,5,B00120NO9Q,"I normally don't review these things.  This is to offset the one derogatory review it received, which was not fair - I actually deferred buying this for a long time because of that horrendous review . . . none of it is true at all . . . must be an Eastern wannabe . . . some people get off on criticizing others.  Now that I have watched it . . truth?  It's an excellent video and value, better than most fly fishing videos.  I buy most of these primarily to observe and assess the destinations, and this is outstanding for that (incidentally, I've already fished all of these rivers except the Gunnison, including the Dream Stream stretch of the South Platte - that is a great stretch, where I've had great success, but it's a ""conditions"" dependent 3 miles with a lot of pressure, and most importantly it simply didn't happen to be the choice or subject of this video - deal with it).  There's also plenty to learn by watching it repeatedly, if that's your purpose for buying it.  And for those who just want a winter fix, it's pretty much a bonanza.  I've now got 29 trout fly fishing videos (lower 48 only), 80% destination oriented, and this is one of the best for me.  I also use primarily Sage and Teton / Abel equipment, so I was quite interested in seeing the extras from other well-known manufacturers.",1293494400,3,1312,4.4149377593361
8243330,1,B00120NO9Q,"Are you serious? This is the worst movie ever. If you have ever fished in your life this movie is painful for even 5 minutes. I am pretty sure he is one of the most incapable fisherman I have ever seen. How do you do a section on Tomahawk for the South Platte and not cover the Dream Stream? How do you NOT do a segment on the Blue? While Marty's book is a good read, and a worthwhile investment for those not familiar with the area, his video is just pathetic. Please do not purchase this video and encourage him to make more of this worthless crap, this movie is just terrible. You my friend, are an inferior angler.",1256860800,,618,4.158333333333333
8243331,5,B00120NO9Q,Marty has a local's insight to Colorado and the best rivers/creeks and he takes his knowledge from the Fly Fisher's Guide to Colorado and brings it to video.  I have been fishing CO for years and found a ton of information on techniques and locations to make my next trip even more exciting.  I can't wait to try some of the suggestions from Gus and the other guides.  Can't beat the deal on this DVD for the money!,1215993600,2,415,4.294871794871795
