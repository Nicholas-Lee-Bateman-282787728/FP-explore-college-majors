Despite the scrolling titles at the beginning of this no-budget waste of time finishing all their sentences in exclamation points, I continued to watch it. I am not entirely sure why I did this. I knew, at the end of it, that I would be begging the gods for the return of the two hours I had spent on this monstrosity--yes, I got to see the 113-minute ""extended dance remix"", and if you don't want to read a whole review of it that will have you begging the gods to return your two and a half minutes, all I have to say is that, while I'm not sure what the twenty-three minutes were that were added back in, they are of a piece with the ninety that were originally released; this is an absolute quicksand of suck.

There is a paper-thin plot regarding a hot doctor (Tina Krause, recently of Penny Dreadful) who uses brain transplants to get all the men in the post-apocalyptic world we're handed to do her bidding, but for the most part, this is a movie whose sole purpose is to get as many women into as many different catfights as possible. And I would thus call it a fetish video were there any actual skin on display, but there is nary a rosy nipple to be found. Which makes me wonder... what is the target audience for this silliness? I can't answer that question, as I have no idea. It's kind of an action picture. It wants to be a horror picture, but (I assume) the make-up budget ran out after they'd made up one zombie, and so he's the only one in the entire film, and he's played for comic relief. It might have had something to say about women's lib given a script (the fact that the scriptwriter is uncredited at IMDB is not, I assume, just an oversight; I'm surprised director Gary Whitson hasn't similarly yanked his name), but no hope.

Oh, one other note: the film was also released under the title Zombie Holocaust; don't mix it up, as some reviewers have, with Zombi Holocaust, a not-so-superior 1980 Italian horror outing by Marino Girolami that, given the crossover in cast and sets, was probably filmed at the same time as Fulci's Zombi 2. That movie, at least, is marginally enjoyable. This is not. *",1297209600,,2180,4.43142144638404
8281929,1,B00000FBLM,"Movie starts when a stupid looking comet hits the earth and kills all people except some chicks. Then it goes to where these ugly chicks gather berries while other chicks bully them and BLAH BLAH BLAH!! Then there's this mad chick (the only hot chick in this movie) who's creating an army of zombies (they are not zombies I'll assure you) and seeks to control uh.... stuff. Then some other woman stops her and that's it!
Horrible acting, stupid plot, wimpy gore, no cannibalism (it said cannibalism in the back of the box cover but they lied) and most important, no zombies to be seen !!!! What the heck is this?? Just another dissapointing movie. Reminds me of ZOMBIE ISLAND MASSACRE, and just like Z.I.M. there were no zombies at all. The movie focuses more on booty and croutch shots after a chick gets killed and wastes 10 minutes at a time boring us to death with the stupidest fight scenes in the world. WARNING: NOT A ZOMBIE FILM!!!!!!
most entertaining part: 2 parts---- the paper bag comet and  the naked chick in the beginning of the film!!",1062201600,2,1050,4.585106382978723
