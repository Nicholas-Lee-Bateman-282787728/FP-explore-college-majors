930312,5,6304824424,"WOW!! a royal rumble to remember. from the first match to the last match, this rumble was ecellent. Vader vs. Goldust was a real great match to start off with. the ending was good with Luna on Vader's back doing a Vader Bomb.  The mini's match was cool. Lots of high flying and lots of action. Sunny as  a ref was good. The tag match was good. the L.O.D should have been the new  champs. The I.C. match was also good even though the Rock cheated, as  usual, and Shamrock loses. He kicked the Rock's butt. then you have the  royal rumble match. this was a classic. with Cactus Jack and Chainsaw  Charlie doing chair shots to start, then having Stone Cold come from the  crowd to enter while everyone waited to get him, it was one of the best  rumble matches in awhile. Then you have the casket match at the end and  what a match that was!!!!!  HBK was at his best during the whole match. A  great championship match from both undertaker and HBK. And when Kane came  to ""save"" undertaker, the crowd went ballistic. Even having Kane  set the casket on fire was the highlight of this ppv.( I am a big Kane fan)  If you have not seen this ppv you must. you'll want to buy it yourself.",917913600,,1179,4.228699551569507

Great opener, some good moves and the Vader Bomb at the end was awesome! Vader had Luna on his shoulders when he Vader Bombed Goldust and won!****1/2 stars

2nd Match: six man mini's tag match. Battalion,El Torito, and Tarantula vs. Nova,Mosaic,and Max mini.

High flying action with 5 aerial moves off of the tope rope in a row! Sunny the ref helpes Max Mini pick up the win.***1/2stars

3rd Match:Intercontinental Title Match Shamrock vs. The Rock

Good match but the ending wasn't so good because the Rock hit Shamrock with brass knucks and then put them in shamrock's tights. Shamrock made Rock tap out to the Ankle Lock but the decision is reversed.* star

4th Match: New Age Outlaws vs. Legion of Doom Tag Titles

crappy! the outlaws tie Hawk to the post and beat animal 1/2 star

5th Match Royal Rumble

Gets Hardcore right off the bat with Funk and Foley. The final fou were Faarooq,Foley,Rock,and Austin. Foley gets eliminated and then faarooq get eliminated by the rock. Stone cold then hits the stunner and throws rock out. Stone cold! he goes on to win at wrestlemania.***** stars

Main Event:HBK vs. Undertaker casket match

Kane comes out and attacks DX and the undertaker and HBK puts taker in the casket and wins. But thats not it. Kane takes the casket and sets it on fire! at the end they can't find taker in the casket and you hear taker's voice say ""i will not rest in peace"".***** stars",1109548800,,1438,4.622047244094488
930432,4,6304824424,"I think this probably the 3rd best Royal Rumble in history. Here are the matches.

1. Goldust vs. Vader 8/10

Good opener and entertaining.

2. Max Mini, Mosaic, and Nova vs. El Torito, Tarantula, and Battalion 9/10

Fast Pace of course. Hardly any pins but it is still very entertaining.

3. The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock 6/10

Not as good as I thought. It went a little slow for me.

4. Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) vs. The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) 7/10

Okay match but the ending is kind of disapointing.

5. The Royal Rumble Match 10/10

Good Match. In the beginning it was a lttle hardcore with Cactus Jack and Terry Funk being the first two in. This Rumble had a lot of known wrestlers such as Steve Austin, the entire Nation Of Domination, DOA (Skull, 8-Ball, and Chainz), all of Mick Foley's characters (Dude Love, Mankind, Cactus Jack, and Savio Vega. It is also funny because Tom Brandi was only in there for like 10 seconds. It is a little predictable, but it is still awesome.

6. Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker (Casket Match) 10/10

Another good match. I hated the ending though.",1106524800,3,1113,4.482587064676617
930433,4,6304824424,"I borrowed this Rumble from a friend and it was one of the better PPV's of 1998.

Goldust vs. Vader:

This was a decent match and it was a good choice for an opener.  I thought that they should have given Goldust a push to win but Vader wins.***

Max Mini, Nova & Mosica vs. Battalion, El Torito & Tarantula:

This was a hilarious match with midgets in it.  I really think midgets should form their own wrestling league.  Anyways, Max Mini's team wins.****

The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock for the Intercontinental Championship:

This was indeed a classic match and the only thing that keeps it from a 5 is that it ends it a Disqualification.  The Rock retains by DQ.****1/2

New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom for the World Tag Team Championships:

This is probably the worst match on the card.  I love the Legion Of Doom but they just didn't deliever in this match.  The Outlaws retain.**1/2

Royal Rumble Match:

This wasn't the greatest Rumble ever but it wasn't bad.  It had a very predictable ending.  Austin wins when he throws The Rock over.****

Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker in a Casket Match for the WWF Championship:

This is the match of the night.  I truly thought that The Undertaker was going to win.  HBK retains when Kane puts The Undertaker in the Casket and sets it on fire.****1/2

Overall this PPV was about a ***1/2 but it looked more like a 4 then a 3.  Basically go and pick this up.",1105747200,,1406,4.423529411764706

Goldust vs. Vader.  Was a decent opener and it good but it could have been a lot better.  Vader wins the match. (2.5/5)

Max Mini, Super Nova & Mosiac vs. Batalion, El Torito & Tarantula.  This was a very entertaining match with midgets.  Max Mini's team picks up the win. (4/5)

Rocky Maivia vs. Ken Shamrock for the IC Title.  This was a good match and better then the 6-man tag match but the ending I wasn't to fond of.  The Rock puts knucks in Shamrock's tights and the ref finds them and disqualifis Shamrock. (4/5)

The New Age Outlaws vs. Legion of Doom for the World Tag Team Titles.  This was a decent match that turned real good and I thought it was the worst of the last 3 matches but it was still good.  The Legion of Doom won by DQ. (4/5)

Royal Rumble Match was awesome.  Sure, it was predictable but it was still great.  Foley came out as 3 different people.  I loved that.  Austin wentr out and won the rumble to go to WrestleMania XIV. (4.5/5)

Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker for the World Title in a Casket match.  This is tied for match of the night with the Royal Rumble.  The ending is shocking and must see to believe.  Kane comes down and once Taker is in the casket he sets it on fire and HBK retains and at WrestleMania XIV HBK vs. Austin. (4.5/5)

930587,3,6304824424,"Rumble '98 was not that good at all. With the exceptions of the Casket Match and the Intercontinental Title Match, the other matches are mediocre at best. Here's the rundown of the card:
Goldust w/ Luna vs. Vader
***1/2
-The ending was great, the rest of the match was....okay. Not a good way to start off a show.
Six-Man Tag Team Minis Match
***
-And those three stars are me being generous. The first minute was exciting, tilt-a-whirl arm drags left and right. Then, after 15 minutes, arm drags start to get real boring.
WWF Intercontinental Championship:
The Rock[c] vs. Ken Shamrock
****1/2
-Awesome match from start to finish. Just a give-and-take contest with plenty of near falls and innovative reversals.
Royal Rumble Match:
***1/2
-Rumbles are usually predictable and this one is no different. At the time, the WWF had a large roster but only a handful could take a run with the WWF Title. Namely The Rock, Shamrock, Mick Foley, Steve Austin, Kane, Triple H, 'Taker, and that's it. Now times are much different. The ending was actually pretty cool with Austin and Rock. Of course, Austin wins.
Casket Match for the WWF Championship:
Shawn Michaels[c] w/ Triple H & Chyna vs. The Undertaker
****1/2
-Awesome casket match with plenty of high spots and death-defying manuevers supplied by HBK. This match also marks the beginning of the end for the ""Heartbreak Kid"" when he takes a sick bump on a casket(only to wrestle four years later). A nice way to finish off this pay-per-view.",1057363200,,1488,4.81640625
930588,2,6304824424,"This event was a bit of a stretch, The stage was set with Stone Cold Steve Austin being a marked man.  Well, so the rest of the show was about him.  Even in matches not about him, the commentators spoke of Austin.  The Rumble match was below average.  The result was predictable as anything the WWF/WWE has put out since.  Austin did carry himself well though. The best match on the card was the Casket match between Michaels and The Taker.  Great match, too bad about Michaels injury on the casket.  What a sad day.  The Rock/Shamrock match was great to watch, but the end was sick... That's saying a lot since my two least favorite wrestlers are Rock and Shamrock.  This is worth the money if you find it for under 13, as I did.  But I recommend getting the Classic Five of 98 box, it's far more valuable, of course if you don't have the other already.",1032134400,,854,4.314465408805032

This event is memorable for a lot of reasons.  Its the PPV that made Stone Cold Steve Austin, and killed Shawn Michaels..

Nice opener with luna getting smashed by vader,

The tag title match i don't think was anything special as i cant even remember what happened except the end.
The royal rumble was entertaining with cactus and funk as the 1st 2 which brang in bins, chairs even a chainsaw to the match just for a while though. Why was this rumble very good?the answer for that is they let it build up as the other rumbles have only like 3 men in it just holding each other to the ropes. The man that stood out the most in this rumble was THE ROCK as he wrestled a match  before the rumble and was  something like 3rd partcipant managed to be one of the last 2 in. And yes, it is right what everyone is saying:It was a predictable rumble but enertaining to say the least.
But wait there is still more ! the main event. A casket match for the title. This was a very good match, not as good as there hell in a cell match though( i wished they had the hell in a cell at the rumble).The high spots  was a tomb stone in the casket, a dive from the top rope into the casket and a backdrop out of the ring where hbk hits his back on edge of the casket.

The Vader vs. Goldust match was the slepper of the night all though it did have a surprise ending
The Rock Vs Shamrock was great, espesially a great effort by Shamrock
I truly belive that this rumble was the best one ever, one of the reasons being that the ring was almost full unlike the past rumbles when its just two at a time.
The main event featured Shawn Michaells vs Undertaker in a casket match, thsi was the best casket match yet and was the night the Shawn injured his back and later could not wrestle anymore, this showed many spots including an elbow drop by shan from the top and into the casket.",989539200,,747,4.158620689655172

You combine the lack of excitement with a shallow talent pool  and too many people in the ring at all times and you come up with a bad  Rumble.
For the most part, the rest of the card was mint. The opening  match between Vader and Goldust was no five-star classic, but you gotta  check out Vader executing the Vader Bomb on Goldust with Luna on his  back...funny stuff.
The only fast forward alerts go to the midget match  and the horrible, HORRIBLE tag team title match between the New Age Outlaws  and L.O.D.
Ken Shamrock and The Rock had a CLASSIC match for the  Intercontinental title, only topped by their match in the finals of the '98  King of the Ring.

Goldust had recently kicked Marlena to the curb and was at his most bizarre here wearing some of the weirdest, questionable, attires by the week. Luna interferes occasionally, giving Goldust a bit of an advantage but It's not enough and Vader stays in control. Vader prepares to finish off Goldust with a Vader Bomb but Luna jumps on his back but Vader still performs the V.B. with Luna on his back and covers Goldust for the win. Standard but entertaining match to get things underway.

2.) Battallion, Tarantula, and El Torito vs Max Mini, Mosaic, and Nova  (Special Referee: Sunny)

I seriously never understood why they always wanted to make Sunny the referee in these mini matches. Never really cared for the mini matches but they could be fun to watch sometimes. Max Mini pins El Torito with a crucifix cradle pin for the win. This would mark the last of the mini matches to take place on mainstream WWF TV. Later that year Vince McMahon would created WWF Super Astros (yes this was a show in the Attitude Era), which was a show specifically designed for the minis and was meant to draw in the Hispanic audience. It failed miserably and the show ended in late 1999

3.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: The Rock (c) vs Ken Shamrock

Great match up here. The Shamrock/Rock feud was one of the best WWF had in 1998. As expected, this was a very competitive back and forth match between these 2 young-ins here. As Shamrock begins to get the upperhand over Rock and seems to get the match in his favor, the Nation runs to the ring and tries to interfere. While the referee has his back turned, dealing with the Nation, The Rock nails Shamrock with a pair of brass knuckles he had in his tights. Rock puts the knuckles in Shamrock's tights and goes for the pin but Shamrock kicks out. One belly-to-belly suplex later, and Shamrock wins the match. However, after the match, Rock complains to the referee about something. Moments later, Chioda has Shamrock take something out of his tights and Shamrock finds the knuckles in there. The referee reverses the decision and Rock is still Intercontinental Champion. Shamrock goes off and belly to belly suplexes Chioda before putting the Ankle Lock on him. It was a nice way to end the match to give the story some continuity as well as give The Rock more heel heat

4.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs Legion of Doom

Decent match. The big story behind this match was LOD getting their revenge on The Outlaws after they assaulted Animal and shaved Hawk's head just weeks prior. LOD control The Outlaws for majority of the match until they handcuff Hawk to a ringpost. Animal takes on The Outlaws himself for a while and seems to get the upperhand on them until Road Dogg cracks a chair across Animal's back, leading to the DQ finish. Road Dogg and Billy Gunn continue to beat down on Animal after the match, until Hawk breaks out of the handcuffs and attacks the Outlaws with the chair before Billy and Roadie escape to the back

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Royal Rumble Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin was the primary focus of the Royal Rumble as leading up to the PPV, he attacked pretty much every other superstar that would be a participant in the Rumble. As a result of this, this made him a target of the rest of the locker room, which was why various superstars were looking for him throughout the night. The first 2 entrants in the match were Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie. Cactus Jack and Leatherface wannabe being crazy as only they can be, take turns hitting each other with a steel chair until Tom Brandy comes in at 3. The most notable highlights from this match included Foley appearing in the Rumble under all 3 of his gimmicks. First Cactus Jack then later on as Mankind and then Dude Love. Stone Cold enters at #24 and the crowd goes insane. Everyone in the ring stops what they're doing and awaits Austin's arrival but the Rattlesnake sneaks in the ring from behind and goes to work. The final 4 are Austin, Dude Love, and Nation members Rock and Faarooq. Faarooq eliminates Dude Love and Austin eliminates Faarooq. The final 2 are Austin and Rock who'd unknowingly become the top stars of the Attitude Era. Austin drops Rock with a Stunner and throws him out of the ring to win the 1998 Royal Rumble. The action was slow paced at first but sped up as it went on. The storyline with Austin being a wanted man was fun and made the match a bit more enjoyable. This was the beginning of Austin's ride on the main event road and it was going to be a spectacular one

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Championship Casket: Shawn Michaels (c) w/Triple H and Chyna vs The Undertaker

This was the 3rd time in the last 4 months that Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker met each other in the main event of a PPV. The build-up as you'd expect was top-notch which was cause for yet another classic showdown between HBK and The Lord of Darkness. Taker and Michaels had tremendous chemistry back in the day and a nice comparison fight of quickness vs strength. Within the opening minutes of the match, Michaels takes his infamous sickening backdrop botch out of the ring, where he hits his back against the edge of the casket, that would be the cause of his 4 year retirement. Michaels avoid the casket on several occasions and oddly finds dust or powder in the casket and throws it in the eyes of Taker. The biggest highlight of the match is Shawn elbow dropping Taker inside of the casket. Nearing the end, as Taker finishes Michaels off with a Tombstone inside of the casket; The Outlaws and Los Boricuas interfere and attack Undertaker (shades of the 1994 Royal Rumble casket match). Moments later, the lights dim and Kane comes to the ring and fights off The Outlaws and the Boricuas. Just when you thought Kane was there to save Undertaker, he turns on his older brother and Chokeslams him in the casket and Paul Bearer padlocks the lid shut. They push the casket up to the entrance ramp where Kane puts a hole in the top of the casket with an axe. Kane douses the casket with gasoline and lights it ablaze with a lighter to close the show. What an amazing casket match this was with a sadistic turn of events at the end that would lead to great things for Wrestlemania 14.

Overall: The 1998 Royal Rumble was fairly solid all the way through. While none of the undercard matches are necessarily must-see, they're watchable nonetheless. The Royal Rumble match was nicely done as well. Although it seemed like everyone was waiting for Austin's arrival (same thing happened to The Rock at the 2000 Royal Rumble), it was still pretty acceptable until his arrival. The 3 Faces of Foley was a nice touch that made it a memorable one. The Shawn Michaels/Undertaker match was another classic that they had and this match marked the end of their extraordinary feud until 2009 when they feuded leading up to Wrestlemania 25. Overall, the 1998 Royal Rumble is one of the greatest Royal Rumbles to ever happen",1421020800,,8297,5.25
7877733,4,6304824424,"This was another old WWF tape that I had found with this being the 1998 Royal Rumble. The highlight to this event is usually the Royal Rumble match but this particular one had a backstory to it. In the few weeks prior to the event, Stone Cold Steve Austin had declared that he was marked man in the Rumble match and over the course of the next few weeks, attacked just about every single participant in the Rumble match making him the odd man out. Also, Shawn Michaels & The Undertaker resume their feud here in a Casket match but this time with WWF Championship on the line but also what was revealed on the previous RAW that Kane & Undertaker had reunited as a team. On top of that, Mike Tyson was scheduled to appear in the sky box as rumors were stating that he was in negotiation with the WWF to be part of WrestleMania XIV.

Vader vs The Artist Formely Known as Goldust. This match stems all the way back to Survivor Series when Goldust had turned heel and abandoned Vader while at this time, Goldust was dressing up as a new Hollywood character (for lack of better terms). Both men started off aggressively with both men resorting to using the steel steps on a few occassions as well as Luna getting involved in the action with a finish that was quite the site as it was something we hadn't seen before nor we have seen since.

Max Mini, Mosaic & Nova vs Battalion, El Torito & Tarantula. Sunny was the special guest referee for this match but she wasn't the traditional referee as she became a factor at several times in this match. With Sunny's antics including the reactions of all the minis' & Jerry Lawler getting all his one-liner short jokes, this was the typical action that you would expect from the minis.

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs Ken Shamrock. Before the match got underway, check out The Rock's comments towards then President Clinton's affair to give you a sign of the direction Rock was going with his character. These two had a rivalry dating back to Survivor Series as well so both men were in the feeling out process early on with both men anticipating the other's next move. From there, it went back & forth into a very competitive match with an outcome that left the door open for this feud to continue but considering the quality here and their future series throughout the year (with the exception being WrestleMania), that wasn't a bad thing.

WWF Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs The Legion Of Doom. LOD were out for redemption here as they were facing the team that not only beat them for the titles, injured & humilated them such as Hawk having half of his head shaved but also the team that proclaimed they were the best tag team in the world. Considering that build, this was a brawl right from the getgo as the LOD were focused more on revenge more than anything else which left an opening for the Outlaws to take advantage. The real turning point was when the Outlaws handcuffed Hawk on the outside making it a handicap match before Hawk freed himself but it was too little too late.

Royal Rumble Match. Before the match, it was announced that Mike Tyson would be involved at WrestleMania in some way while also showing that he was a die-hard Stone Cold fan who as mentioned was the odd man out in this match. This was one of those Rumbles where you had an idea of who was going to win going into but it still managed to turn out to very entertaining as you had so many highlights throughout the Rumble such as the opening period with Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie turning this into an unofficial hardcore match bringing in various weapons & even having a chair competition to the point to where The Rock ended up paying for it for getting in the middle of it, The Nation showing that it was every man for himself as they fought amongst each other, what happened between Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett that eventually brought out an injured Triple H to show what his true purpose in the Rumble was, feuds such as Rock/Shamrock & Vader/Goldust getting their receipts from earlier in the night, Stone Cold being the target of the match to the point where the action in the ring stopped when his music hit for everyone to get their hands on him & eventually do so, Mick Foley appearing as all ""3 Faces of Foley"" & the final showdown between Austin & Rock.

Casket Match: WWF Champion Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker. Before the match, check out the interaction between Mike Tyson & DX to again show the direction that particular moment would lead into. Shawn wasted no time in jumping Taker right from the start before Taker starting using his power advantage including one moment early on where Shawn was backdropped out of the ring with his lower back hitting the edge of the Casket that caused the back injury that put Shawn out of action for over 4 years. Shawn regained momentum by using a chair & the steel steps along with outside help from Hunter & Chyna. Both men even went as far to use the Casket for offensive moves such as HBK delivering an elbow into the casket & Taker executing a tombstone from the apron before more outside help came out for each man but it was the appearance of one man that Taker had a past with that made the difference & set up not only a WrestleMania main event match but also a flaming casket. Even though this match is more remembered as the match that ended HBK's career for four years, this was a great main event as Taker & Shawn never had a bad match together.

In the end, this was one of the better cards in the Rumble's history as well as one of the best from 1998 as various seeds were planted here for future feuds leading into WrestleMania (Taker/Kane, Austin/Tyson/Michaels, HHH/Owen, Rock/Shamrock) while for the most part we had solid in-ring action with a very entertaining Rumble on top of that so I would recommend checking this one out.",1377820800,,5843,4.475609756097561

7877737,4,6304824424,"Royal Rumble 1998 was a pretty good event. Most of the matches were very good and watchable. The WWE Title Match was the highlight of the night. A good overall Royal Rumble.

1. Vader vs. Goldust with Luna
This was a good match. It was much better than what I expected it to be. I really enjoyed Vaders work, especially as for a big man. He is one the greatest big man wrestler ever (much better than mark henry, khali, big daddy v, etc). A pretty good match. Good opener. 3.5/5

2. Six Man Mini Match with Sunny as the Special Referree
Battalion, El Torito, & Tarantula vs. Nova, Mosaic, & Max Mini
No disrespect to any of the mini matches or any of the mini wrestlers but this was just a funny match to watch. The match was pretty great as well though. It was very fast paced with a lot of arm drags and head lock takedowns. Some good high risk and funny spots. A very good mini match. Listen for the Kings stupid a55 short jokes all throughout the match. Some of them were pretty funny. 4/5

3. Intercontinental Championship
The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock
Pretty good match up. Some brawling and wrestling from both men. Shamrock gets the victory but then the ref reverses the decision after he finds brass knucks in the tights of Shamrock after the Rock brought them into the match by hitting Shamrock with them. Decent match. 3.5/5

4. WWE Tag Team Championship
The New Age Outlaws vs. The Legion of Doom
This match had potential to be a very good tag team match and it was until Hawk got hand cuff to the ring post and then Outlaws got dqed after hitting Animal with a steel chair. Before then it was a good match. Some good slams and some intense brawling before the hand cuffing. 3/5

5. The Royal Rumble Match
We all know who was going to win if yall was watching Raw the previous weeks building up to the Rumble. But it turned out to be a good Rumble to watch.

It starts out with some ""hardcore"" wrestling between Cactus Jack and Terry Funk until the Rock got into it and then the ring would start to fill up. It got personal between Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett when Jarrett took out Hart before he entered the ring. Triple H & Chyna would come out & screw Hart which would lead to their match at Wrestlemania. Some good outside action with the Rock and Stone Cold. Predictable ending but we all knew who was going to win it. Good Rumble. 5/5

6. Casket Match for the WWE Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker
Classic match. This is also where Shawn really injured his back on the edge of the casket. Shawn managed to fight through the pain and he & Undertaker gave an awesome performance. Undertaker gets piledrved onto the ring step by Michaels. Just like the 1994 Rumble, 6 or 7 guys comes out to the ring & trys to beat down the Undertaker until Kane comes out and who then would eventually turn on Undertaker and give Michaels the victory. Kane would then set the casket on fire to set up their match at Wrestlemania. A classic bout. 5/5

This was a pretty good Royal Rumble ppv. Not a bad match on the card. It was a good event. The casket match was a classic but if I was yall I would also check out their Hell in a Cell Match, that was nothing compared to the Casket Match, it was so much more physical and violent.",1213660800,,3235,4.2918032786885245
7877738,4,6304824424,"This is not the best Royal Rumble but it is also not the worst. The undercard had good matches and you are able to watch the casket match over and over again. Here is the card

1. Vader vs The Artist Formely Known as Goldust. This match was far from great but it is a opener that will satisfy you. The Vader Bomb was great. Luna was on his back when he did it and she went flying in the air. 6/10

2. Six Man Mini Tag Team Match. Max Mini,Mosaic,and Nova vs Battalion,El Torito,and Tarantula. This was a funny match but there were a lot of high flying moves but the arm drags started getting boring after awhile. Sunny also helped Max Mini. King started dissing out Max Mini and it was hilarious. 8/10

3. Rocky Mavia vs Ken Shamrock(Intercontinental Championship). This is a very good well paced match with Shamrock winning with the Belly to Belly suplex. The ending is not that bad as people say with the Rock telling the Ref that he hit him with the brass knucks and reverses the decision. So the real winner is Rocky Maivia. 9/10

4. LOD vs NAO(Tag Team Championship). This is an okay match some nice moves but when the handcuffs came into play it ruined the match for me. 6/10

5.30 man Royal Rumble. This was very easy to predict who was going to win but it got a little boring during the middle but beginning was excellent with Cactus Jack and Terry Funk beating each other with chairs, garbage cans etc and also when Stone Cold came out from the opposite way and everyone went after him after eliminating Marc Mero unexpectedly. 8/10

6. Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker - Casket Match (WWF Championship). This was a great match but not better than their Hell in a Cell match which was excellent. This match had a great pace the whole way through while using chairs, the casket, the steel steps, and powder. The highlights of this match were the piledriver on the steps to the Undertaker, the backdrop on the casket, the tombstone off the apron into the casket, the chair being used several times, then Kane came out chokeslammed the Undertaker in the casket closes it up and sets it on fire. Awesome match. 10/10",1141430400,3,2117,4.443298969072165
7877739,4,6304824424,"What a night. I'll never forget when Triple H said when he won the rumble,it would be the end of all who look like a pirate. Then AJ Styles came and hit him with a box of bricks. Now for the matches.
1-Zach Gowan vs Christian in a hall of ""shame"" match
10/10
The loveable losers of WWE.Zach takes Christian to new heights by smashing his head with TVs and then his fake leg,but Christian would eventually win by submission with a wet willy
2-Max Mini vs Giant Gonzales
11/10
First,Gonzales threw Max so far,we had to wait two days for him to return,but when he did he hit gonzales so hard,he almost went into a coma. Max then tried a leap off of the turnbuckle,but lost his balance and died from the near 6 foot(30 foot for Max)drop. However,he was later revived and would compete in the rumble as a substitute for someone,but that will be explained later.
3-Goldust vs the artist formely known as Goldust in a doppleganger match for the Intercontinental title
uhhh.../10
we all remember ""goldy's"" stint as the artist,but when he returned while Goldust was in as Goldust,its match time! TAFKA Goldust made Goldust hit himself at first because he was confused
who TAFKA Goldust really was. Then,he grabed a umbrella and ran to attack,but tripped on it and broke his rear,as if he wasn't cranky enough after running out of weed to smoke. Meanwhile,as Goldust continued to attack himself,in a shocking moment,Dustin Runnels came out and low blowed Goldy,allowing The artist formely known as Goldust to cover him for the win and the belt. Then,afterwards Goldy needed surgery. Brain surgery.
4-Eugene vs Raven for the rights to the n. W.o name
10 and a half/10
Raven started by hitting Eugene with a celing fan,a paper fan,and a WCW fan. When he tried a 1075 splash however,Eugene countered with steel steps to the face. Raven bled a lot,and then died,but would return as a zombie in the Rumble match later on.
5-WWE championship Tables,Ladders,chairs,and Barbed wire featuring two rappers match
John Cena vs PaRappa the Rapper w/Sunny Funny
Holy Crap/10
So brutal,so dangerous,so cool. Current champ PaRappa started out by taking the ladder and slaming Cena with it. Cena returned the favor with multiple chair shots and the blood started flowing. Cena then climbed the ladder,but PaRappa pushed him off and he fell onto a Barbed wired table. From there,Rappa used a Barbed wired ladder and almost hit Cena with it,but missed and somehow,someway,fell onto a bed of thumbtacks. One bad scene in the match I won't reveal,but it involves PaRappa's leg,a cinderblock,and a steel chair. Cena finally got some back-up from the Trademarc,his rap partner,as they doubled teamed the hip-hop
dog all the way to another bed of thumbtacks.looks like a new champ was gonna be crowned,but all of a sudden the match turned around when Sunny blinded the Doc of thuganomics with a stun gun to the back,a la Starrcade 98. A chair shot or two...hundred later and PaRappa climbs the ladder to retain the WWE title

In the end,AJ Styles and HHH were the last 2 in the ring and both went out at the same time.they were declared co-winners like in 94,but then Styles shot HHH,so the winner is AJ Styles. Afterwards,PaRappa and Sunny came out and then Sunny told AJ,""You great but you'll never beat the Hip-Hop hero."" PaRappa then finished by saying ""Because I gotta Believe!""Truly a night to remember

Update: This was obviously a joke review. The event was very good especially the casket match and surprise (sort of) ending",1137283200,,4402,5.531157270029674
