8731397,5,B014LQ3F7S,"When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping for an experience that would calm the mind chatter as well as the physical body.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The beautiful photography moves you into grand vistas that is New Mexico (not still pictures).  The celestial music and the breathtaking landscapes combine to remind one what an amazing place our planet is, and that we are so blessed to be a part of it.  Suddenly my perspective of what is important in life is redefined.
You will not regret purchasing this DVD.",1461542400,,523,4.6521739130434785
8731398,5,B014LQ3F7S,"This inspirational music video is beautifully choreographed with breath-taking New Mexico mountain and high-desert scenery.  Both my husband and I felt uplifted and energized, while watching gorgeous scenes of Red-Rock country, New Mexico rivers and mountain-sides covered with quaking Aspen trees, and Santa Fe style adobe architecture all synchronized perfectly with rich, meditative music. Thank you Randy for sharing your beautiful work and your story with the world!",1458086400,,471,5.926470588235294
