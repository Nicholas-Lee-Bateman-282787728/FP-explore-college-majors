While Summer is no doubt a lot of people's favorite season, it's usually too hot here for me to enjoy outside for very long. But put it on a DVD and you've got me. I LOVE watching all the different types of scenes, from the beautiful flowers to all kinds of water scenes - my favorites. Then there's the awesome sunset - this DVD is simply mesmerizing. It relaxes and takes all the stress away. I just think this DVD is amazing and I watch it often, as I also do the other 3 season DVDs - I have them all and love them all.",1438646400,,586,4.060344827586207

7901615,5,9089704485,"Another fantastic title from the Isis Visuals / World Nature Video team!  This disc is from their ""Seasons"" collection, and transports the viewer to scenes of ocean seascapes, streams, waterfalls, lakes, fields, wildflowers and a water garden.

The main film is supported by all natural sounds of the scenery, and takes a journey to all of the above locations.  The scenery is clear, fantastically shot and transitions naturally.  Some videos have one shot for the whole file, and some race through the scenes so you can't ponder and take in the natural wonders you've paid to view at your leisure.  The symmetry of some of the shots is amazing.  check out the view of the waterfall through a squared off branch, and you'll see what I mean.

The most magic parts of the main film are the shots in which we get to linger looking into the water.  There is one at the mountain type of stream that has greenery swaying beneath the flowing water, and another in a rocky water ares that shows the flow of water and the ricks beneath it.  .  Another favorite scene is the watery reflection of the trees along the shore of the lake, It's mesmerizing.

In addition to the main film, there is a ""soothing scene"" focusing on the ocean gently lapping on a calm beach.  There are three natural decoration scenes too.  In these we get a longer look at one view of the water garden, a golden sunset at the beach, and my personal favorite from within the middle of a field of lavender focusing on the surrounding countryside.  This scene transitions from day to dusk, and even has a few flying insects add to the lovely cacophony of crickets.

I make a habit of having nature dvds on as background when at home, and sometimes even at work on  a portable player.  I can temporarily transport myself somewhere else, and this particular title is a ticket to an unforgettable summer I can enjoy any time.

I recommend these dvds to my friends and have given them as gifts to fellow workaholics.  This is a title I will reach for often.  try it!!",1386460800,2,2025,4.541436464088398
