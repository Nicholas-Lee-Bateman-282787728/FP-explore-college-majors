This is a story about the nomination of Clarence Thomas for Supreme Court Justice and the use of Anita Hill to challenge his nomination. They both went to law school together. It shows the background work that was done. Thomas is shown how to behave and neutralize questions. An independent committee was created to push support for him. Does he have any embarrassing incidents in his past? Most politicians have created enemies who will act against them. Thomas will meet important people and must play ball with them. Anita Hill is afraid to testify because of fears of reprisal at her job.

Thomas is coached as to what to say and what to omit. Tiptoe around Roe vs. Wade. What Thomas did is common in Congress, one person says. These charges are dynamite is what she says is true. Was this woman set up to destroy Thomas chances? [This tells about the workings of Washington rarely mentioned in your daily newspaper.] I did not! says Thomas; they are lies. In turn there are counter-attacks. What is the public perception? The President will not defend him publicly, they want a delay. This woman can be neutralized if we get her first! Why didn't she report this earlier? It would ruin her career. Dont believe anything you read in the newspapers says one man. The Hearing begins, Thomas testifies. He denies everything. What could he have done? He lists the claims against him. Reporters were snooping around his garage. Anita Hill talks.

How can they rebut these charges? Anita Hill began to fear for her job. Thomas denies it all in an emotional speech! These guys play rough. Will it hurt him with the public? There is a witness for her. Polls say the public is for Thomas. Hill asks for a polygraph. The FBI investigates a video rental store. Next Angela Wright will testify before the Senate Committee. All the public knows is what they hear on TV. One Senator is warned about the future. The vote confirms Thomas as Associate Justice, he is sworn in. The reward for these public relations managers is to work for President Bushs re-election. But a loss of womens votes elected Bill Clinton. Its the economy, stupid. Clinton won a second term. Was it his looks or his politics?

What do we really know about when corporations control the news media? This movie is educational in showing what goes on behind the camera in preparing to put on a show. Almost everything you see on TV is done by actors and paid for by big corporations. They control your thinking, buying and voting. They act in their interests, usually not the publics best interests. But most people believe what they see on TV or read in the newspapers. Do you? If youve ever had personal experience in something like a crime you compared it to what you read in the newspaper. Was it accurate? If not, thats why they use eyewitness testimony in courts and not something written in the newspapers. Dont believe anything you read and only half of what you see.",1445731200,,2964,4.672413793103448
