8222478,5,B000WCDIN2,"Trainers of all kinds of animals routinely rely on ""place"" training. For some reason, until Allen Pogue came along, I had never thought of using it for horses. Allen has a brilliant understanding of the mind of horses and in this DVD clearly explains how you can use a""place"" or pedestal to train your horse. This is a great piece of knowledge for all kinds of horses, and has particular benefits for horses who have some difficulties to overcome. The DVD is clear, easy to follow, and completely loaded with useful information. You and your horses will love doing this!",1306022400,2,570,4.71
