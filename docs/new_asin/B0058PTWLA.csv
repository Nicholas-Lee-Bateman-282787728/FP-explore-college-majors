8462196,5,B0058PTWLA,"My wife bought this series to help our nine -year-old daughter defend herself against bullies or other attackers. They watched them together and then had me simulate attacks and their ability to escape and defend is amazing! I'm 200 pounds and 6'4"" and my wife is 120 5'3"". With the techniques and element if surprise, she could get away from me easily. The moves were designed for a small person to defend against someone bigger, stronger and more athletic. The guys on the discs are really fun and funny even with scary and serious subject matter. I wish every girl was taught this stuff, there would definitely be less violence against women and fewer sexual assaults.",1455235200,9,671,4.793103448275862

I am enrolled in jiu- jitsu self-defense class right now and those DVDs are of great help. I can come home and review the moves, make corrections if needed.

8462201,5,B0058PTWLA,"It arrived the Summer of 2011... and finally the world has a women's self-defense curriculum that not only is presented in a fun and energetic manner, but one that covers the wide array of violent situations with quality instruction and the attention-to-detail that the Gracies give time-and-time-again. This review is intended to be ""no-holds-barred"" and will give the reader not only the strengths but weaknesses of this dvd series from both the viewpoint of a professional self-defense coach and from a beginning student.

DISC ONE (BASE, RELEASES, TRAP & ROLL)

DISC ONE really gets the ball rolling by discussing the enemy (strangers/non-strangers) and the ""Triangle of Victimization."" What was a pleasant surprise to me and something I deem a necessity (in teaching self-defense) a strong emphasis on what the Gracies call the ""Base Get-Up."" Balance is crucial in self-defense and nothing rattles/confounds a woman more (initially) knocking her off balance. Regarding the ""Base Get-Up) In the words of Eve, ""It is not the most lady-like, but it IS the safest."" The most important thing to take (after viewing) is that you shouldn't expect to have the technique when you need it most if you don't use it in everyday life. Learn the ""Base Get-Up"", train it and make it an organic part of your movement.

Having the women perform the techniques gives the viewer relatibility and identification in the movements. In terms of video, every so often the camera would zoom in on a specific body part during the techniques which is extremely helpful for the student viewer.

DISC TWO (CHOKE, SUPER SLAP, GUARD GET-UP)

Again, the Gracies begin at the beginning, and add what many instructionals (books, dvds, etc.) leave out; how to prepare your body for an attack. In this case, tensing your neck muscles in order to resist the pressure on your windpipe. There are some pros and cons when it comes to the ""Super Slap"", however, (as someone who has taught women's self-defense for over a decade) I can see why they choose this approach. Regarding the remainder of the disc, you receive what Rener & Ryron consider one of the most important (if not THE most important) technique of the entire series... the Guard Get-Up. A great deal of fear comes when your assailant has you on the ground. In this gem of a technique, the Gracie brothers show the viewer not only show an effective and energy efficient escape, but distraction techniques (i.e. Super Slap) and distance builders.

The front choke defense and guard get-up feel very practical. The guard get-up is my favorite because it provides hope when you are in a panic-causing position whereby the predator is between your legs. When this happens, this technique is very useful.

DISC THREE (FRAME, T & R EXTRAS, GET-UP EXTRAS, TRIANGLE CHOKE)

In this disc, the viewer/practitioner (having 6 lessons under their belt) really begins to learn that what might have worked in one scenario, might not work in another. In self-protection, variables change and it's very important that the student knows not only how to remain relaxed/confident in their actions but also how to recognize when something doesn't work. Beginning with the Stop-Block-Frame, this disc offers the viewer a sturdy support system for any attacker that encroaches within your personal boundary. In three distinct ""slices"", the Gracies effectively show the student, first, personal defense with the attacker outside of arm's length. ""Slice 2' covers how to ""Brace & Base"" when the attacker makes contact, and finally (slice 3) shows ""The Frame"" technique (for those persistent buggers who won't take a hint). *It should be noted (in my opinion) that the Stop-Block-Frame is somewhat flawed (see End Notes).

Lesson 8 & 9, however, is endorsed with the highest enthusiasm. There are many variations of techniques in the self-defense world, but when an attacker (for example) mounts his victim but is supporting his weight strongly with his arms or (possibly a scarier & more common scenario)... he's pinned your wrists! What do you do? Again, these ""Extras"" are perfectly placed to optimize peak performance and diminish the ""quicksand"" that many self-defense professionals call ""The Fear Loop."" The disc ends with a popular jiu-jitsu technique known as the Triangle Choke, which utilizes the strongest asset a woman has (her legs) against the attacker's neck. The ability to render your attacker unconscious is bound to empower the female viewer to new heights.

Lessons 7-10 are fun techniques. What makes this dvd set so thrilling to own is that it provides tools for almost any situation. If not exactly, there is something adaptable). Whether you are in a tight space or in the middle of a parking lot, the teachers will instruct you on how to use the technique according to the scenario and what techniques to use for the different types of attacks. Once you are successfully ""proficient"" on all the moves, you will be much more confident about yourself and your ability to defend against an attacker. Then, it's off to Disc 5 where you can earn a Gracie Pink Belt!)

DISC FOUR (HAIR GRAB, GUILLOTINE, ELBOW ESCAPE, REAR ATTACK DEFENSE, WEAPONS)

Just when you though things couldn't get more interesting, more empowering, the Gracies give you lessons 11-15. As viewers... we are introduced to another Gracie, Ralek. In this disk, the student is introduced to many of the ""more challenging"" situations; specifically the hair grab, attacks from behind, and attacks involving weapons. In the world of self-protection there are numerous techniques, many of which are too difficult/complex to pull off in a high-pressure situation - NOT SO in the Gracie curriculum. First and foremost, they present two important statements that every woman must take to heart:

Those who use a weapon, normally will use as intimidation. (Usually to move you to a secondary/more isolated location)
Don't ever let them take you to a secondary/more isolated location! weapon or no weapon)

An important aspect however, that is rarely touched upon in weapon defense is what we should do (or expect to do) if we manage to disarm our opponent [see End Notes].

The guillotine chock happens to be one of my favorite moves. Perhaps because I am always able to use it when my husband and I practice self-defense and other times when we are play-wrestling. For some reason, he loves to go head first into me and then that's when I pull the choke. All the other moves are also fun, but are not quite as easy to perfect as this one.

DISC FIVE (PINK BELT QUALIFICATION TEST)

In this disc, the Gracies explain that (if you so choose) after reaching a solid foundation regarding the mastery of these techniques, you may want to make a qualifying video of yourself to be evaluated by one of the Gracie instructors themselves. Not only will you be rewarded a pink belt if pass the test, but (pass or fail) you will be given a review sheet of comments and areas that need more work. With or without this step, the Gracie family sincerely wants to help keep women safe; and to be evaluated on your performance of the techniques is just one of the ways in which you'll feel more empowered and capable of handling any future situation that you may (but hopefully may not) confront.

DISC SIX (TOTAL EMPOWERMENT TALKS)

One of the most beneficial aspects of any program resides in connectivity. The message and depth of knowledge aside, our ability to ""connect,"" relate and understand what women go through and may have to go through at some point in their life is (not to overuse the word) Empowering - but also comforting and reassuring. You may listen to these talks at any point in your training and segments of these are offered for free on the Gracie's YouTube channel.

DVD SERIES CONCLUSION

There is absolutely nothing like this on the market today (in my opinion). The presenters are not only young and fun, but have a deep knowledge-base and can communicate their thoughts brilliantly. Speaking from personal experience as a self-defense coach (and primarily a ""Women's Self-Defense"" coach at that), I can say with 100% certainty that the lessons in this dvd series will not only empower you, but will serve as a wonderful foundation for future study in jiu-jitsu or any other martial art you undertake. Also, and most importantly, the techniques (if you diligently practice them) could one day save your life!",1319500800,27,8549,4.971988795518207
