1891381,5,B00009W0UJ,"This No Mercy really surprised me because of how good it was.

1. Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri(WWE Cruiserweight Championship)

This was an awesome Cruiserweight title match to start the show. Don't to listen to the people who say that there weren't any good high-flying moves here, there were some really good ones. I didn't like the ending though. 9 out of 10.

2. A-Train vs. Chris Benoit

This was probably A-Train(or Albert's), best match. Benoit took everything A-Train threw at him and still came back for more. That includes a sick bump on the chair. Very good match. 9 out of 10.

3. Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy

This match was supposed to take place at Summerslam, but Gowen was hurt. A good match with some really impressive moves performed by Gowen. 8 out of 10.

4. APA vs. Basham Brothers

This wasn't too good, it went really slow. I felt that Faarooq would never make the tag. When he finally did, the match got good, but its not worth sitting through the whole match to get there. 5 out of 10.

5. First Ever Father vs. Daughter I Quit Match

Vince McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon

As many others have said before me, this was a bad match but good entertainment. Nothing else to say. 7 out of 10.

6. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle

So far, I've reviewed 4 PPV's with John Cena vs. Kurt Angle on them, and all of them have been very good. This one is no exception. It seems that Angle brings out the best in Cena. Great Match. 9 out of 10.(The best 1-on-1 match that these two have had was at No Way Out 2005)

7. Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show(WWE US Championship)

Over the weeks before No Mercy, Eddie has embarassed Big Show. Big Show got his revenge on the previous Smackdown, and Eddie came to the ring with cuts and bandages on his back. This was a good match. Eddie's lying,cheating and stealing didn't work tonight. There was even some pretty good weapons use by Eddie, but Big Show still won. 8 out of 10.

8. Biker-Chain Match

The Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar(WWE Championship)

They really could've made this another type of match because they only used the chain once. But besides that, this was an awesome main event. Very physical and some good spots including a Tombstone on the steps and Undertaker jumping over the top rope on to the FBI.9 out of 10.",1148515200,,2267,4.434782608695652

TAJIRI defeated REY MYSTERIO to Retain the CruiserWeight Title: Very solid opener. Nothing really new or overly spectacular, but very well paced, timed & generally put together. Both guys consistently bring a lot to the table, and they did so once again for this 12 minute bout. The run-in ending was cheap & abrupt, but if it's for the good of long-term feuds in this division, then I'm fine with it. Match Rating...7

CHRIS BENOIT defeated A-TRAIN: Typical A-Train match in that it wasn't terrible, but none of his bouts stand out in any great fashion. This was probably a little better than usual though, due to the intensity from Benoit & some surprisingly good psychology throughout the match. Plus, the correct man went over. There were a few good spots too. Although two of them involving the chair, appeared to have been botched. When Benoit was dropped head first onto the chair, I genuinely feared for his career. Match Rating...6

ZACH GOWEN defeated MATT HARDY: Right from the beginning, I'm going to tell people that I was really disappointed in this match. But don't put me down as the usual Zach-hater, because I'm not. There was just so many things wrong with this 6 minute bout. The duration, the result, and most of all, the extreme lack of any psychology. Matt Hardy has never been a spot wrestler, so throwing him in with Gowen and asking him to defend more than attack, is just terrible booking. I mean, he never even started to work on Zach's injured leg!!! This better lead somewhere, or else Matt's career just took a huge fall. Match Rating...4

THE BASHAM BROTHERS defeated THE APA: You knew we were going to be in trouble when The Bashams' entrance was met with complete silence. The team should be given time, but Danny (Damaja) Basham seems out of his league at the moment. The more experienced & technical Doug is holding the team up, in my opinion. Meanwhile, The APA go through the motions leading up to the predictable hot tag to Bradshaw. It all seems so familiar!!! As for Shaniqua's clothing & ummm, body swelling; No comment. Match Rating...4

VINCE McMAHON defeated STEPHANIE McMAHON in an ""I Quit"" Match: As bad as this storyline has been, I have to give credit where credit is due, by stating that this match was a lot better than I expected it to be. Vince obviously carried the bout & there surprisingly wasn't too many wasted minutes of nothing in it's 10 minute duration (I had this scary feeling it would last about 20 minutes). Furthermore, I actually believed Steph was a chance to win during her spurt of offense in the middle of the bout. Still not what I would call quality entertainment, but achieved it's purpose. Match Rating...5

KURT ANGLE defeated JOHN CENA: Good 18 minute match that probably has to be given the nod for match of the night. Nothing extraordinary, but a well put together bout. Cena won some fans & even though he is not all that far from taking the next step, Kurt pretty much carried this match. The DDT on the apron was one hell of a spot. Match Rating...7

THE BIG SHOW defeated EDDIE GUERRERO to Win the United States Championship: Eleven minutes of typical big man vs small man action. The first half of the bout was very ho-hum, while the latter half was fairly well put together. Although I thought the unpredictability aspect of this match helped it a great deal, as there was a feeling that either man could win during the closing minutes. The dissension between Eddie & Chavo afterwards will hopefully not mean a demotion for the talented Eddie anytime soon. Match Rating...6

BROCK LESNAR defeated THE UNDERTAKER in a Biker Chain Match to Retain the WWE Championship: Ho-hum & playing it safe, this bout just did not give anyone the impression that it was the main event of the night. While there were quite a few very good sequences, the attempt at psychology was a bit much for a 24 minute match. And when all was said & done, the expected brutality was replaced by an overbooked finish which did nothing but disappoint. I don't know which was stupider; The lights going out for no reason, or an appearance by The FBI!?!?!? Match Rating...6

PPV RATING (45/80) = 56

Looking at the key, I have given No Mercy a 'C' grade & have said that it was 'Average'. Right on, if I do say so myself. It was out-rated by last month's Raw ppv (Unforgiven), and that included a Coach/Snow vs JR/Lawler match!!! No Mercy wasn't terrible, but it was oh so run-of-the-mill. Only 2 matches scoring a 7 out of 10 on my lenient scoring system is just not good enough. I'll say it again; This is pay-per-view for goodness sake, reward the purchaser. It's very frustrating to see the likes of Guerrero, Benoit & Hardy wasted, while Haas, Benjamin & Chavo weren't even used at all. Disappointing!!!",1114732800,,5307,4.622741764080765

  The extra's

  1. A intrview with Big Show

  2. John Cena raps with a fan

  3. Billy Kidman vs. Shannon Moore. Sunday Night Heat. (very good match by both men) This is probably the best I have seen both men wrestle.

  4. Eddie G. Sprayes raw sewage on Big Show. Memorible Moment

  The event

  1. Rey mystrio vs. Tagiri

  Rather slow for a cruiserweight match but good though

  2. Chris Benoit vs. A-Train

  Very good match my favorite on the ppv. Very great wrestling by Benoit. I like Benoit more as a wrestler after this match. The sick bump was where A-train tried to drop Benoit on the chair but Benoit tried to get out of it and slipped on A-train's body sweat and fell right on his neck. But Benoit kept goin.

  3. Zack Gowen vs. Matt Hardy

  I don't know why they pulled the plug on Gowen this is a very good match-up.

  4. APA vs. The Basham Brothers

  AHHHHHHHH. Those were the tag matches back then. Now all the good ones are broke up like THe APA.

  Stephanie McMahon vs. Vince McMahon

  Very emotional match. Probably the most emotional match ever. I thought Steph would win but Vince did.

  Kurt Angle vs. John Cena

  Great Match

  Eddie Gurrerous vs. The Big Show

  Probably the most devolped match in storyline wise next to The I-Quit match.

  The Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar

  Very Slow but good. They robbed Taker. The gimmick was a Biker Chain match. Just a way to get money.

  Overall the sewage extra and the I Quit match and soooo much more gives this DVD a must buy.",1111276800,3,1624,4.310580204778157
1891386,4,B00009W0UJ,"This was simply an unbelievable Pay Per View. Many matches had me on the edge of my seat and definitely represented a turning point in Smackdown's history.

The first match that really impressed me was surprisingly the encounter between A-Train and Chris Benoit. Although A-Train has remained unpopular throughout his whole career, his involvement in the feud between Stephanie McMahon and her father, really brought meaning to the encounter.

Secondly, the match between Matt Hardy and Zach Gowen provided an entertaining match. I was particularly astounded at the manoeuvrability of the one legged superstar and despite being at a disadvantage with Shannon Moore at ringside, he nevertheless picked up his first win in the WWE. Justice is served!

One match which indeed shocked me as well as heightened my hatred of Vince McMahon was the match between the chairman and his daughter Stephanie McMahon with the stipulation that if Stephanie lost the encounter, she would step down from her role as general manager. I was so hopeful of Stephanie McMahon winning this encounter, but I realised that this somehow had to set the backdrop for Survivor Series 2003, as I saw No Mercy after this.

One match which i found particularly boring was the match between The Basham Brothers and the APA. The Basham Brothers are simply the most boring tag team in WWE history, along side the likes of Test and Albert, La Resistance and Rico and Charlie Haas. This just demonstrates how we will never have tag teams that can work well and indeed perform to a high standard such as the long deceased Hardy Boys and the Dudley Boys.

I found it hard to watch the match between Eddie Guerrero and Big Show for I have always been a fan of the Big Show and could not tolerate his heel run during those two years.

The main event was coincidentally timed with what happened in the same month the year prior, with Undertaker facing Brock Lesnar in Hell In A Cell. Nevertheless, this time the roles were reversed, with Undertaker going into the match as a Babyface and Brock Lesnar entering as the heel, despite the success he had achieved as a babyface from late 2002 to mid 2003.

This is perhaps the best Smackdown Pay Per View I have ever seen. This was a period in time when the show had some brilliant superstars on its roster and it had heavyweights that were deserving of main event status. Unfortunately, it seems that history will not repeat itself and wrestling by Vince McMahon's standards will be the undoing of the WWE.",1110931200,,2510,4.7695852534562215
1891387,3,B00009W0UJ,"Ok...The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because of the following complaints:

1. Brock and Taker's match was expected to be much more brutal than this. The chain wasn't used much. And I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Brock and Undertaker had a couple matches the previous year that were FAR more exciting.

2. Although Stephanie and Vince's match was a lot more action packed than we could have ever predicted...I still was upset at the crap ending with the towel being thrown in.

I am not the biggest Stephanie fan, but at the time this took place she was at the hieght of her new found popularity.. And I thought it was increadibly stupid to have her leave the show at this point.

And clearly my fears about that were confirmed when they then made Paul Haymen the general manager of Smackdown. And as you know...Paul went on to do a terrible job as General Manager. He was more annoying than ever and the show took a nose dive for a while... after Stephanie had brought the ratings up.

Plus, Vince ended up vanishing for a while anyway, so it made no sense at all for the writers to think having him win in this fashion would be a smart idea.

My biggest PRAISE for this event was the match with (face) Kurt Angle versus (heel) John Cena. Great Match! And one of the last times we see John Cena shine while playing the villan. Also, this was the last time Kurt Angle really kicked butt as the good guy before the writers started leading him back to becoming the villan again. Anyway, I think Kurt should have stayed as the (face) good guy a while longer than he did. And here you get to see why. Plus, the events that lead up to this event concerning Cena and Angle were absolutely hilarious and entertaining. It was quite a FUN feud to watch.

So, taking the good with the bad....I decided to give it 3 out of 5 stars.",1108598400,,1838,4.325581395348837

If anyone could provide A-Train with his best match it would be the wolverine.  It even gets serious after a blown spot as Benoit seemed very angry.  A very intense ending.

Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy

A-Train vs. Chris Benoit was a good match and one of the better ones on the card.  Benoit couldn't make A-Train tap out to the Crossface so he put him in the Sharpshooter and made him tap out. (7/10)

Zack Gowen vs. Matt Hardy was a bad match that you don't need to see.  This is Zack's last match in the WWE until Lesnar beats him to a bloody pulp and he hasn't been seen since.  Zack also wins this match which I think is good. (4/10)

1891398,4,B00009W0UJ,"This PPV is hard to judge since it had its good moments and its bad ones. I'll do the usual ""my take on the matches"" thing.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Tajiri for cruiserweight championship- pretty good match and its great to see the cruiserweights go at it with all the high flying and quick action. The ending was bad but still a good match.

Chris Benoit Vs A-Train - poor a-train can never get any respect, even when he was prince albert and drozs' piercing artist back in the late 90's hes still the same jobber hes always been. anyways not a bad match and really showed benoits talents. Nice props with the sharpshooter to give tributes to all the harts that have used it.

Zach Gowen Vs Matt Hardy - an ok match, not one of hardys best and nothing against Gowen, but I just don't see him being a superstar (and no, its not the one leg thing, its just him in particular). I think the WWE exploited him being one legged and really made it harder to showcase anything he could do since all people saw was ""a handicapped person"". I'd like to see him come back again sometime but this time, try not to show his handicap but show his abilities.

A.P.A Vs The Basham Brothers - two tough teams that you would think would resemble a classic Demolition Vs Powers Of Pain match. Sadly it did not. I don't know if someone wasn't feeling right or maybe they looked at the paycheck and it said way less than they thought it would but this match should've been much better.

Stephanie McMahon with Linda McMahon Vs Mr McMahon with Sable in First ever Father/Daughter ""I Quit Match"" - geesh, the promos leading up to this just creep the heck out of you. Not a bad match overall though it had the weirdest rules. definately one to watch as in a way, if you think about it, it resembled Bob Backlunds ending Vs the Iron Shiek many years ago (if you all can remember that).

Kurt Angle Vs John Cena - an amazing match. I'd have to say the best on the card and an instant classic. So back and forth that it'll amaze you that these two have such good wrestling chemistry together.

Eddie Guerrero Vs The Big Show for U.S. Championship - a pretty decent matchup that showed that big shows size really did come into play, though eddies speed and ""cheating"" helped him try to overcome the giant.

Undertaker Vs Brock Lesnar in 1st Ever Biker Chain Match for WWE championship- a good match that showed the brawler vs the wrestler very well. Would of been better if the chain was used as well as if the interference didn't keep on happening but then again, its the main event and the ending always has to be dramatic somehow :)

All in all a decent PPV. Not the greatest, but hey it depends on your tastes. I mostly bought it for the biker chain match and Steph and Vince match, but liked the others as well so I think I made a good investment. If you only like one match on here, i'd suggest you get it if you find it cheap. If you like a few or just need it to complete your collection, well get a copy when you can since you won't be too disappointed.",1096848000,,3026,4.276223776223776

Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri: A surprisingly fast paced match that the crowd was really into to. Lots of high impact and high flying moves. The ending was bad though because two unknown ""fans"" charged the ring and caused Mysterio to get pinned. Still a good match, even with a bad ending. 8.5/10

A-Train vs. Chris Benoit: This was another great match, very surprising since it had A-Train in it. A chair was used a lot in this match, and a scary moment when Benoit fell on his head. Benoit didn't make A-Train tapp out with the crossface, but he did with the sharpshooter. 8/10

APA vs. The Basham Brothers: One word - DUD! That amazon woman comes down to the ring and costs the APA the match. After the match she claimed that a clothesline from hell had swelled her, cough cough, and made them bigger. Can we say brest implants? A horrible match.  6/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show: The lead up to this match was great, the match itself was only okay. Eddie tried everything to keep his title, but Big Show fought long and hard and became the US champion. Luckily Eddie would win the Main title four months later, but right then, this was only an okay match. 7/10

Zack Gowen vs. Matt Hardy: Dont know where Gowen went after this match, after the beating he got from lesnar he disappeared. The match was short, and okay just for the fact that Gowen got his first, and only, win on a ppv. Definatley forgettable though. 7/10

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle: Best match of the night by far, the crowd was very into this match right from the very start. Kind of symbolic that Kurt had his medals in one corner and Cena had his chain in the other. A back and forth battle that proved Cena can actually wrestle, when he's not making very bad rhymes. A great match that Kurt won. 9/10

Mr McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon: If you look at the video that led up to this match you will be totally creeped out like I was. The crowd was behind Stephanie the entire time, and unfortunately even that didn't help this No Holds Barred Match. A very creepy segment in this ppv. 7/10

Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker: Why was this called a biker chain match? The chain wasn't used AT ALL in this 25 minute plus match. The interference by the FBI and Mr. McMahon totally ruined the match and brought it down. Dont watch this if you want to know what a chain match is, because your questions won't be answered. 8/10

All in all, this is okay to rent. Don't buy this unless you are willing to pay for it just for the Kurt, Cena match. The rest rank from ehh to What the hell is this?",1095552000,,2760,4.321083172147002
1891400,3,B00009W0UJ,"Not a very good PPV.  The Smackdown brand did not do the best job.  There was one real good match, though.

1. Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri (Cruiserweight Title)

Good way to kick off the show, except the match wasn't what was expected.  These two had some great matches on Smackdown.  Why not make the PPV match good?  Akio and Sakoda make appearances in the match.  (7.5/10)

2. A-Train vs. Chris Benoit

This was probably A-Train's best match in the WWE.  Although, Chris Benoit pretty much carried him the entire match.  Good dedication to Stu Hart by Benoit, with the use of the Sharpshooter.  (8/10)

3. Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy

This was supposed to be at Summerslam.  Who cares.  I am glad Gowen is gone.  I am very glad the WWE switched Hardy to RAW.  (4/10)

4. APA vs. Basham Brothers (#1 Contender Match for the WWE Tag Titles)

Ummm, why was this on here?  I guess it was a card filler.  Very bad match.  (5/10)

5. Stephanie McMahon vs. Vince McMahon (I Quit Match/If Stephanie Loses She Has to Give up Her Spot as Smackdown GM)

This was actually a pretty entertaining match.  Stephanie put on a good performance.  (7.5/10)

6. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle

Great match.  By far match of the night.  It really saved the PPV.  Probably Cena's best match in the WWE so far.  The crowd actually got on Cena's side and started chanting his name.  (9/10)

7. Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show (U.S. Title)

I was expecting a lot from this match, but nothing really happened.  It was somewhat boring.  (7/10)

8. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (WWE Title/Biker Chain Match)

I hated this match.  Why was it a Biker Chain Match if it was barely used.  Very, very disappointing.  Vince makes and appearance.  This match is long and very boring.  (7/10)

Do not buy this DVD.  The only reason I would say to get it is because of the Angle/Cena match.  Although, this is on the Cena DVD (which I heard wasn't very good)

Zach Gowen V.S Matt Hardy- This was CRAP the action was semi-decent but two guys that suck in a short match with no story why put it on a PPV  2/10

1891402,3,B00009W0UJ,"WWE Cruiserweight Championship

Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri 7/10

Tremendous opening match. Tajiri is definetly a underrated Cruiserweight Champion. The match was turning in Rey's favor until Tajiri's henchmen came from the crowd to cost him the match. One of the best Cruiserweight matches I've seen.

Chris Benoit vs. A-Train 9/10

I personally didn't know how Benoit was going to win this match because lets face it. A-Train is bigger, stronger and hairer then Chris Benoit. But in a true nostalgia ending, the Crippler ends it with the Sharpshooter.

Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy 2/10

The PPV starts to go downhill from here. Gowen is amazing in this match but probably didn't earn the contract and Matt Hardy has from TLC matches to Smackdown's jobber.

APA vs. The Bashem Brothers 1/10

Typical Smackdown tag team match. Should had been on Sunday Night Heat.

Father/Daughter: I Quit Match

Mr. McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon 6.5/10

Match began very good but starts to get worse and worse and starts to become a train wreck. I wasn't that much of a fan of the match so it made it hard to really watch the match. Giving the match a 6.5 is being nice.

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle 10/10

Match of the night!!! Great wrestling involved and the beginning of Cena's popularity growing. Worth buying the DVD just for this match. Highly Recommend. Its true, Its damn true!

WWE US Championship

Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show 7/10

You can see in the earlier part of the match that Eddie isn't healthy and the Big Show really knows how to take the crowd out of a match. Still some good spots and its really wierd to see how the US belt looks like a watch when the Big Show holds it.

Biker Chain Match: WWE Championship

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar 6/10

Not a good main event. Not even in the same world as the Hell in a Cell match from last year's No Mercy. The FBI and Mr. Mcmahon get involved on Lesnar's behalf. Though 'Taker might pull it off but another disappointing ending to a wierd PPV.",1093219200,3,1984,4.5852272727272725

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP- Biker Chain match

Brock Lesnar (c) v. The Undertaker 7.5/10

No where near their hell in a cell a year earlier, but still a quality match. The ending really did it in for me though.. could've been a bit better, but served it's purpose as a transitional match for both Lesnar and 'Taker.

Kurt Angle v. John Cena 9/10

I rarely give tens, and this one came DAMN close! Outstanding in every respect. The Psychology was second to none. Great match. Almost worth buying the DVD just for this match!

UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP

Eddie Guererro (c) v. The Big Show 7/10

Really didn't mind this match. Big Show has improved tons, IMO, and is starting to come back around. Guererro is his usual brilliant self.

FATHER_DAUGHTER I QUIT! MATCH

Stephanie McMahon v. Vince McMahon 5/10

Now I don't EVER get weirded out by WWE stuff. The Katie Vick Angle was kinda sick, but tolerable. The Eugene retard thing is tolerable. But the Dad beating the holy hell out of his daughter really got to me. DIdn't watch a whole lot of this match.

WWE CRUSERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

Rey Mysterio v. Tajiri (c) 8/10

Another solid match with these two... Tajiri is a hell of a performer and Rey is just Rey. These two go together well. Enjoyed the match

Chris Benoit v. A-Train 6.5/10

This match was the start of the big Chris Benoit push to the world heavyweight championship. A-Train stuck with him but the match just didn't have much intensity.

Zach Gowen v. Matt Hardy-6/10

Not a Gowen fan, sorry. Hardy stoops to new levels of Jobberland...

APA v. The Basham Brothers 4/10

Nothing too awful. Nothing to get excited about either.

Overall I thought No Mercy was a strong show. The Kurt/Cena match and the cruserweight championship are enough to buy the dvd alone. The main event wasn't great, but it was solid none the less... I'd say give it a rent first before you buy. I did and I bought it.",1091318400,,2020,4.633802816901408

1891411,4,B00009W0UJ,"Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship
Good opener with a lot of high flying moves.  The ending was cool.  ""Fan"" interferce, distracted the ref from giving Mysterio the win, and Tajiri capitalized with a kick to the head.  7 out of 10.
Chris Benoit vs. A-Train
This was a power vs. technical match.  Benoit was fighting with ground moves, A-Train was whooping up on Benoit.  In the end, Benoit wins with the sharpshooter.  9 out of 10
Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy V1
I hate Zach Gowen.  He's extremely lame, and should have never won this match.  He wins with a moonsault though, to get his first win.  4 out of 10
APA vs. The Bashum Brothers
This match was boring, but a lot of attacks, which made it move fast.  Shanuiqa returns and hits Bradshaw with a night stick, helping the Bashums win.  5 out of 10.
Mr. McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon in an I Quit Match
I liked this match.  It wasn't action packed, but it was an exciting match, because of the emotion.  I was staning up the whole match.  In the end, Mr. McMahon wins by choking out Stephanie, and Linda McMahon throws in the towel.  Stephanie never quit, but I am so happy that Mr. McMahon won.  He is cool.  9 out of 10.
John Cena vs. Kurt Angle
GREAT MATCH!  Cena and Angle gave it all they got kicking out of each other's moves.(Cena's FU and Angle's Angle Slam).  Cena did an excellent job.  He couldn't make it out of the Angle Lock, and he tapped, giving Angle the win.  Cena had a great rap also.  10 out of 10.
Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show for the US Title
Boring match.  It was pretty obvious that with the injuries, Big Show would win.  Eddie didn't come out in a low rider.  How ever, it was funny to see Eddie's tactics with out the ref.  In the end however, he gets choke slammed, and Big Show wins the title.  YAY.  7 out of 10.
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar for the WWE Title
Good Match.  Brock Lesnar won with interference by the FBI AND VINCE MCMAHON.  Other then that, good power match.  Brock keeps his title.  YAY.  I hate the Undertaker.
In conclusion, No Mercy was a good event.  I am not just saying that because I went (first row), but because it had some great matches, it changed WWE forever, and it had a good story line.  I suggest you buy the DVD.  When A-Train comes out, my head is right next to the WWE sign.  BUY THE DVD, GOOD PPV.",1082419200,,2341,4.2505694760820045

Mysterio vs Tajiri-Very rarely do cruiserweights get 10-15 minutes in the ring but in this match they did. It didn't disappoint. This match was not all high flying moves but was still fast paced and was probably the fastest match of the night. Tajiri wins thanks to a stranger in the crowd. Time-12 mins 8/10
Benoit vs A Train-Both men wrestled an exellent match but these two just don't go together. The match was slow but it was alright because of some moves from Benoit. Great tribute to Bret Hart with Benoit winning with the sharpshooter. Time-8 mins 6/10
Matt Hardy vs Zach Gowen-Not a very good match. Hardly no moves and slow paced action made it dull. The only good thing was that it only went for 7 mins. Zach Gowen picks up his first official win with the split legged moonsault. Time-7 mins 4/10
APA vs Bashams-BORING!!!!!!!!!! Two bad tag teams in a fist fight is not what people want to watch. There was no point in having this match on the card. Time-9 mins 4/10
Mr McMahon vs Stephanie-I quit match-Better than I expected with Stephanie fighting back but still not a good match. I thought Steph was going to win when she had the steel pipe but Linda threw in the towel when Steph was getting chocked out. A tragic family affair. Time-7 mins 6/10
Cena vs Angle-Finaly a good match!!!.Cena's rap at the beginning was cool and the match had great moves and entertaining standoffs. Amazing that Cena kicked out of Angle slam and Angle kicked out of the F-U.Angle made cena tap to the deadly Ankle lock. Time-18 mins 9/10
Big show vs Eddie Guerro-Big Show dominated the whole match and Eddies back was too damaged to fight back. One sided match with no real point to it. Big Show wins with the chokeslam and takes Guerros U.S championship. Time-12 mins 6/10
Lesnar vs Taker-Biker chain match-Match of the night. These 2 have a great rivalry and put on a good show. The action was good and taker nearly got the chain a few times. Lesnar retains after vince screws the Undertakr again. Time-24 mins 9/10",1081641600,,2141,4.506426735218509

TAJIRI VS REY MYSTERIO 9/10- excellent match. have always wanted to see these 2 go at it. reminds me of the great wcw cruiserweight matches. ending is only thing that kept this from being a 10.
A-TRAIN VS CHRIS BENOIT 9/10- what a suprise! a-train's best match of his career. benoit brought the best out in him.

U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP
EDDIE GUERRERO VS BIG SHOW 6/10- these 2 don't work well together. their styles don't mesh, even though they tried to make it work. disappointing match. boring in spots. the buildup was awesome for this, but didn't live up to the hype.

1891434,4,B00009W0UJ,"Well the WWE puts out another No Mercy and this one was somewhat of a let down. I mean it was pretty good to an extent but come on. It was basically a regular WWE SmackDown! that you would watch on UPN. The only exceptions were the Bikerchain Match and the ""I Quit"" Match and maybe Zach Gowen's first win. I have to admit, I was amazed. Zach Gowen finally won. I think it was more of a ""It's about time"". I will give this PPV a 3 out of 5....but since WWE finally added the Extras since the last DVD that had it ""WWE Bad Blood 2003"". That's the only reason it gained an extra star. So to the matches. I'm pretty sure this is the right order of the matches.
First Mactch: Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri (4/5) Great Action but a really messed up ending involving the two new Japanese guys. Tajiri wins and retains his Cruiserweight title.
Second Match: Chris Benoit vs. A-Train (5/5) This was a great match because of Chris Benoit. This was probably A-Train's best match ever. Chris Benoit probably pulled out the victory due to Stu Hart's death. In dedication he gave him props after the match as he looked to the sky. Chris Benoit wins.
Third Match: APA vs. The Bashams (3/5) the only reason I gave this a 3 was due to the fact that Bradshaw pulled out a nice Fall Away Slam off of the 2nd rope on one of the Bashams. The Bashams need a better gimmick. The Bashams win due to Shaniqua coming out and hitting Bradshaw with a foreign object and one of the Bashams doing his finisher.
Fourth Match: Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy (4/5) Zach Gowen put up a great fight. Matt Hardy tried to help Zach. Shannon Moore who was in Matt's corner did absolutly nothing. Which was good and bad at the same time. We want to see a good match with no interference and yet they have Shannon Moore at ringside who is trying to get a push but just stands there to watch Matt lose. Zach Gowen picks up the victory due to his finisher ""The Moonsault"".
Fifth Match: Stephanie McMahon vs. Vince McMahon In an ""I Quit"" Match (5/5) Vince pulls out the victory. It was very entertaining. I rated this match on entertainment value. Of course when you watch a man versus a women, you really shoulden't expect much of athletisism. Unless it's Chyna or Lita. Well it was a good match was Stephanie getting good pops throughout the match. It was a mixed crowd due to vince being the owner and everyone following him and Stephanie since she's the face and deserves the win.
Sixth Match: Kurt Angle vs. John Cena (5/5) A great match. Two of WWE's greatest athletes going at it one on one. I loved it, aswell as the crowd. Both men have their own following so it went well. Amature Wrestling vs. a street fighter.
Seventh Match: Eddie Gurrero vs. The Big show (3/5) Basically for entertainment value. Eddie pulling off his DQ gimmicks to try and DQ Big Show and get him in trouble....but it backfires and poor ole' Eddie loses his U.S. Championship.
Eighth Match: Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker in a Bikerchain Match. (4/5) Good match but it wasen't as good as last year's Hell in a Cell Match. The WWE Title was on the line and their was a lot of interference. The Undertaker went to grab the chain and the light's went out. They came back on and Undertaker was back in the ring. This seems familar....Screwjob. Anyways, later on The FBI interferes and Nunzio, stamboli, and Palumbo get whooped by The Undertaker. Undertaker pulls off a nice Plancha out of the ring and over the top ropes. Nice move. The Undertaker later on goes for the chain and as he grabs it Vince than comes from behind and pushes Undertaker from the top ropes down on his nuts to the 3rd rope. This allows Brock Lesnar to grab the chain and hit Undertaker with it and take the win with the 1,2,3. This match set up the Vince McMahon vs. Undertaker Buried Alive Match at Survivor Series 2003.

1. Cruiserweight Championship-Tajiri d. Rey Mysterio to retain the title after two unknown men interfered. Good match, but not as good as there first and second encounter. 6/10
2. Chris Benoit d. A-Train with a sharpshooter. This match was very good. It just proves that Benoit can make anyone look good, especially this loser A-Train. 6/10
3. Zach Gowen d. Matt Hardy after a moonsault. What the hell were they thinking letting this cripple beat a great wrestler like Matt Hardy???? I almost cried. Gowen is a joke and Hardy should be getting a push, not losing to one legged freaks. Pretty plain match. 4/10
4. Basham Brothers d. APA after Shaniqua interfered. I am not a fan of either of these teams, especially those pervert Bashams, but they got the victory over the beer drinking dorks the APA. This match was of Velocity caliber and should have been left off the ppv. 3/10
5. Father-Daughter ""I Quit"" Match - Vince McMahon d. Stephanie McMahon after choking Steph with a steel pipe. This match was very entertaining, but some really unnecessary stipulations were added that took away from the anticipation of the I Quit match. Stephanie could pin Vince, which really doesn't make it an I Quit match anymore. Still, it was good and Stephanie lost which made it even better. Linda threw in the towel which should come into play later on. 7/10
6. Kurt Angle d. John Cena with the ankle lock. Awesome match that really showcased Cena's abilities. Angle puts on another classic(seems like every ppv match Angle does is classic). Definitely in the top five in the list of matches of the year.
10/10
7. United States Championship Match-Big Show d. Eddie Guerrero to win the title after a chokeslam. Guerrero's reign ended after three months with the title in a really good match. Big Show nearly wins several times,but Eddie nearly manages to cheat his way to victory. Big Show eventually prevails to become US Champion. Good match from both guys. 7/10
8. WWE Championship Biker Chain Match-Brock Lesnar d. Undertaker to retain the title after Vince interfered and allowed Lesnar to grab the chain and nail Taker in the head with it. Great match that really did not need to be a ridiculuously named Biker Chain Match. Some great back and forth action with lots of interference and the lights going out. Taker proves he still has it and Lesnar secures his first real title defense since beating Angle. 8/10
Overall a very entertaining show. The first two matches are very good and the last four are great, but the middle of the show is dull with some unneccessary matches dragging the show down. Still, very good showing from the Smackdown guys.",1068854400,,2748,4.7510460251046025

Nice blood spot in this match, 1 Star earned. Had a good tribute to the Hart's with the end being Albert in a sharpshooter, 1 Star earned, hence 2 Stars.
Matt Hardy vs. Zach Gowen (7 mins) 2/5
A mediocre match with both men putting on half-decent performances. My thought is that Matt had to bring it down a notch considering his twice the man that Zach ""Hop Along"" Gowen is. Hardy has never had to half-ass it before in his career, but now that the human freak-show is around Matt was forced to perform at a less than intense level. Just sad that one less than par person is aloud to bring down an entire roster of real Superstars.
Basham Brothers vs. APA (9 mins) 3/5
Terrible filler, not a good match at all. Had that crap with Shaniqua. The Basham Brothers aren't that great and the APA deserved to win. Again with the ""Run In"", give me a break. Can't us fans just be given an even fair match were the best competitors win and not the ones with the best ""Run In"".
Vince McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon in a No Holds Barred I Quit Match (9 mins) 4/5
This match was better than what most people expected with Vince bleeding the hard way. This match exceeded everyone's expectations, and was fun to watch. Linda throwing in the towel, Shades how Bob Backlund lost the WWE title many years ago. Steph lost the match but never said I quit, the stipulation said if Steph said I quit in the match than she would have to quit as SMACKDOWN! GM. She never said I quit in the match look for that to play out on the show.
Kurt Angle vs. John Cena (18 mins) 5/5
Match up of the night by these two men. Angle got bloody. This was an extremely good match. John Cena can definitely wrestle.
Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show (11 mins) 4/5
Is there any real doubt that the Big Show can beat anyone on any roster at anytime? My only problem with this storyline was the build-up, Show jumping Guerrero on SMACKDOWN!, making it seem like that would be the only way to beat Eddie is by cheap shots. Whatever, the right Superstar won.
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar in a Biker Chain Match (24 mins) 5/5
A good performance by both men. This match didn't really need to be a biker chain match since it was only used once. It also leads up to the feud between McMahon and Taker. Featured yet another ""Run In"", this time it was Vince running in to help Brock retain, and remain not only the WWE Champ but also Brock holds an undefeated record over the Undertaker, and know one can say that. Realistically The ""Run In"" was unnecessary, Brock can beat Taker anytime and proved that in all three match ups.",1068163200,,3201,4.301324503311259

There are a few scary spots in this match. It's very entertaining and probably the A-Train's best match to date. 8/10

Chris Benoit vs. A-Train (12 mins)7.5/10

A+ matchup by these two men. Angle got bloody. This was a very very very great match. I loved it. John Cena can definately wrestle. This was the best match of the night.
Eddie Guerrero vs. big Show (as the semi?) (11 mins) 6.5/10
A decent Big Show match. Eddie is a great wrestler. This match was ok. I think it lasted just the right amount of time.
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar in a Biker Chain Match (24 mins) 8.5/10
A good performance by both men. This match didn't really need to be a biker chain match since it was only used once. That was the only dissapoint ment. It also lead up to the fued between McMahon and Taker.
Overall a 7/10 show. Pretty solid. The main event was somewhat of a letdown. The WWE can put extras on this one maybe this.

No Mercy Intro video:

  great video featuring the father-daughter  match and the main event.pretty good though.
Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri:
  great cruiserweight action until it got ruined by these stupid japanese mafia guys.
Benoit vs. Atrain:
  why, why didn't they put a stipulation like a cage match or something? Smackdown quality but longer.
Gowen vs. Matt:
  I love Zach's courage and awesome balance and moves, pretty good match actually.
Bashams vs. APA:
  Again more Smackdown TV quality, should have been like a special brawl or something.
Vince vs. Stephanie:
  A lot of people hated this one but I enjoyed it. Judge at your own discretion.
Big show vs. Eddy:

  Meh. I liked the buildup with the truck attack, but the sewage was just ridicoullous.

  Great wrestling intensified action.

Some good stuff here--the Main Event with Taker and Brock--seemed like Taker was always putting Brock over, but maybe that was the point. Kurt and Cena had a great match, but also a lot of stuff to zip past or not watch at all.

Vince beating Steph, pretty good entertainment. I don't have to go too in depth with shows this old since we all know why Steph left. Replacing her with the mad genius Heyman was great, too. Overall, maybe the only 2003 ppv I've seen that was less than stellar. Better stuff out there like Judgment Day and Vengeance...",1523059200,,663,4.525
7993295,4,B00009W0UJ,"Alright

Set up as a WWE's Smackdown event this event caught my eye with the Brock Lesnar on the cover but also a few matches that were okay.  That's it really.",1518220800,,160,4.129032258064516
7993296,3,B00009W0UJ,"SmackDown's last PPV event of the year was a downturn during a year that the brand was head and shoulders above its sister brand thanks to a midcard of athletic wrestlers, and a dependable main event where each person could hold their own while Vince McMahon helped build up an epic feud between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar. Everything seemed to be cooking on all cylinders... until No Mercy signaled that all might not be well on the blue brand.

No Mercy wasn't an awful show, though; there were several wrestlers that turned in good if not exceptional perfromances, including Kurt Angle and John Cena, who would turn in a nearly great match. Cena gave the sort of performance that hinted at his later greatness. Other good matches involved Tajiri defending his Cruiserweight Title against Rey Mysterio and a hard-hitting grudge match between A-Train and Chris Benoit.

The biggest disappointments on the show were the two main events; neither the ""I Quit"" Father vs. Daughter match nor the Undertaker/Lesnar Biker Chain Match met expectations and both were hampered by head-scratching decisions (ex. The FBI?!). The Taker/Lesnar match was decent at least, just not worth remembering.

Amongst the other matches, nothing really sticks out as terrible, but nothing the WWE offered was worth putting on PPV either. Arguably, this was the start of the main event push for Eddie Guerrero, so that's nice to see. I just wish his match with the Big Show hadn't been quite as much of a squash. This event isn't terrible; its just too middle of the road to be of much interest.",1410134400,,1571,4.876404494382022
7993297,2,B00009W0UJ,"This PPV is just bad as the Movie:Sidekicks. The lowpoint of this show was the ""I Quit"" match between VKM & Stephanie McMahon which also allow Step to pin him for the 3 count making it the worst ""I Quit"" match ever. a true ""I Quit"" match does not allow pin falls in this type of contest. That match was crazy and I saw the The 4 Doinks-Team Bigelow match at SS 1993. The Matt Hardy-Zack Gowen match is no better. The wrestling & the ending of that match are laughable in a bad way like a Ed Wood film. The Undertaker-Brock Lesnar match while not a bad match it failed to live up to thier 2002 HITC fight. I mean a biker chain match? What is this the 1980's? and VKM's run-in to help Brock made it worse. The US title match between Big Show & Eddie Guerrero was sad & pitiful. The ONLY good matches were the Kurt Angle-John Cena bout & The A-Train-Chris Benoit fight which both were good solid matches but bottom line it's still a bad PPV. I give this show a 4 out of 10.",1277942400,,970,4.0837696335078535
7993298,3,B00009W0UJ,"Tajiri VS Rey Mysterio: Should be a classic but I was surprised at how slow this match was at some points. Still a good opener though.

Chris Beniot VS A-Train: I'll admit I cannot watch Beniot as much as I use too because of what happened. The match was a good and I enjoyed the end sequence.

Zach Gowan VS Matt Hardy: I respect Gowan but was never sold on him as a wrestler. Didn't really bother to watch this one even though Gowan wins in the end via moonsault.

Basham Brothers VS APA: Bashams were on there way up and APA were almost finished as a tag team. Not a bad match but nothing I enjoyed, the ending was predictable.

Vince McMahon VS Stephaine McMahon: I tried to watch it but I hated it.

Kurt Angle VS John Cena: Cena cuts a funny rap promo before the match. Overall, a solid match with Angle making a green Cena tap in the end. Too bad he didn't do that when Cena was in Hogan phase.

Eddie Guerrero VS Big Show: Three days before this match took place, Big Show choke slammed Eddie onto a pick up and his back was pretty cut up. Eddie sold the injury well and Show had a really good match. Show wins the US title in the end via choke slam and then gets a great interview backstage.

Brock Lesnar VS Undertaker: No idea what a Biker Chain on a Poll match is suppose to be but this match was pretty standard. The ending was stupid and the chain didn't really add anything to the match.

The extra includes Guerrero spraying Big Show with crap, a Kidman-Moore match I didn't view. I don't know why WWE doesnt do extra anymore like they use too.

Overall, Smackdown had the greatest array of talent during 2003 from Lesnar, Angle, Guerrero, Beniot, and Mysterio to name a few. Each Smackdown PPV should have been a cant miss affair. However, this match had an equal balance of good and bad matches. The main event was a letdown as well. Still, I'd check this PPV out.",1276214400,,1882,4.264044943820225
7993299,2,B00009W0UJ,"Virtually nothing about No Mercy was anything but average or below average.  Save for maybe the first match, everything was listlessly dull to sit through and terribly lacking in everything the WWF was about.  Perhaps this was early enough that I would have thought the loss of WCW wouldn't have had such an imminent affect on the WWE's quality, but I was wrong.

Cruiserweight Championship
Tajiri (C) vs Rey Mysterio
All Smackdown has going for it nowadays, and apparently back in 2003, is and was the cruiserweight division.  This was the best match of the night, and a rather quick one at that.  They went at each other in heavily athletic style, reminiscent of old WWF.  Tragic.  (9/10)

Chris Benoit vs A-Train
This was a great match in the same way ECW on Sci-Fi is better than old ECW.  A-Train dominated Benoit virtually the entire match, and suddenly Benoit picks up the win with a sharpshooter at the very end.  Tragic and pathetic.  (0/10)

Zach Gowen vs Matt Hardy
At first I thought, ""Oh no, another nobody like Luther Reigns, Matt Morgan, and Nathan Jones"".  Then I saw Zach come to the ring, pry off his leg, and toss it to the timekeeper.  Then I saw a painfully short match which saw a one-legged kid show incredible skill and talent for wrestling, including pulling off a perfectly flawless moonsault for a finisher.  (7/10)

The Basham Brothers vs The A.P.A.
I love how ridiculously flaccid the Basham's entrance music was---like the cheesiest of mini .MIDI techno/dance songs with absolutely no energy to it.  I got an ear-ful because the crowd was dead silent when they entered.  The rest of the match was typical dull WWE brawler-fest.  No innovation, no interest, no excitement.  The crowd seemed to agree with me.  (2/10)

I Quit Match
Vince McMahon vs Stephanie McMahon
This one was amazing.  The video package they made for it was incredible, and the hype building up to it was extreme.  The match itself was something of a dud if not for the audience reaction to it all.  They were simply ON the entire match, shrieking at the top of their voices for Stephanie and booing Vince.  The sheer volume of their roars when Stephanie got her hands on a metal pipe was astounding.  This match wasn't about the action or the wrestling---it was about the entertainment.  (6/10)

Kurt Angle vs John Cena
Cena is a terrible wrestler and an even worse gimmick.  At least these days he doesn't torture us with his awful rap rhymes like he did back then.  This match was surprisingly upbeat and consisted mostly of Cena getting whomped upon, and tapping out like Angle said he would do.  (5/10)

United States Championship
Eddie Guerrero (C) vs The Big Show
This one was also heavily hyped up, including a segment on Smackdown which I thought, despite the fake sewage, was really low and pathetically done.  The match, unfortunately, was apparently of the least priority in the storyline of Eddie overcoming his demons and his familial betrayal.  The Big Show's height and weight advantage over Eddie was heavily sold, and aside from some very clever cheating by Eddie, there was really only one result for the match, and a new US champion.  (3/10)

WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar (C) vs The Undertaker
This was the waning days of the Undertaker's lousy ""american badass"" biker gimmick, and it was really showing.  Aside from the new music which was really lousy, you could see in his eyes and appearance that the Undertaker wasn't fully ON in this match like he was early on in the gimmick, or during his infinitely more popular Deadman years.  Lesnar wasn't given a chance to show off any spectacular wrestling moves like he would do at No Way Out 2004, so there was really little to this match but striking, fake punches exchanged, and a suplex or two.  Even the whole ""Biker Chain Match"" gimmick was a total failure, as its only appearance was on top of a high pole which no one got to until the very last two minutes of the match, in which it was used in one of the most fakest punches of 2003.  Luckily a month later, Vince McMahon would bury the dying biker gimmick of the Undertaker's for good.  (1/10)

All in all, this was a run of the mill WWE pay per view, no better than an average episode of Smackdown extended an hour and a half (allowing for commercials)",1186704000,,4281,4.652

7993301,3,B00009W0UJ,"Crusierweight Champion Tajiri vs. Rey Mysterio - This was back when there was actual focus on the crusierweight division as these two were allowed to go out there & have a great match with plenty of time to execute.

Chris Benoit vs. A-Train - You know your bad when you have a BORING match with Chris Benoit & that was the case here.  I'll be honest & say I fast foward though this because A-Train does nothing for me in the ring.

Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy - This was the last SmackDown appearence of Matt Hardy for almost 2 years & the last appearence of Zach Gowen period. It's amazing the stuff Gowen can pull off with only one leg & Hardy had to really sell for this kid and the match was kept pretty short so it's watchable.

APA vs. Basham Brothers - This was one of the better APA bouts I can remember in recent memory as they matches up well with the new team of the Basham's.  The ending resulted in the return of Shanquia with her chest ""swelling"" from the Closeline from Hell by Bradshaw.

I Quit Match: Vince McMahon vs. Stephanie McMahon - If you take one thing into concideration, this match isn't as bad as you think as it was revealed on the McMahon DVD was that Stephanie was getting married in less than a week from this match so they went light so she didn't have a bruse or scratch on her.  This was a better ""sports entertainment"" match than a wrestling match.

Kurt Angle vs. John Cena - This was one of Cena's best showing in his entire career as he & Kurt always seem to work well with each other.  This match & fued with what made the fans take to him more than ever to the point where he was turned babyface weeks later.  Match of the night.

United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show - This match played to Eddie's weakness as he was selling the beating Show gave him on SmackDown so it was mostly a ""david vs. goliath"" type match with Show dominating for the most part until it was just too much for Eddie as Show won the U.S. Title.  Check out the part in the end when he tried to put the belt on his wait to realize it's too small.

Biker's Chain Match: WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Out of their 3 series of matches, I would say this was my least favorite.  That doesn't mean it was bad but there's no way they're going to top Hell In The Cell last year and this just wasn't as good as their first encounter at Unforgiven last year.  They do work well together & had a nice match between the two with them getting very physical (and I think even stiff at times) with spots such as the tombstone on the steps.  The chain wasn't even a real factor in the match and the ending was to set up the match next month because Undertaker & Vince McMahon.

The DVD extras I can remember from this were Cena having a rap battle with a fan outside & the ending of SmackDown two weeks earlier when Eddie sprayed Big Show with raw sewage.

Overall, this was an average No Mercy with nothing really special standing out besides the Angle/Cena encounter so I would suggest this as a rental & judge for yourself.",1178755200,,3049,4.227586206896552
