8566773,5,B00BDU0NW6,"Bennie Stout is not a bad boy, it is just that mischief and mayhem happen whenever he is around! He is energetic and bright, but often a little careless, especially about his personal safety (he gets into scrapes that his mother or brother have to rescue him from). He lives in a small, picture-postcard Dutch fishing village, circa 1930. His father is away working on a fishing boat off the coast of Spain. St. Nicholas' Day is approaching, and whilst other children want candy or sweets, all Bennie wants from St. Nicholas is the safe and prompt return of his father. When St. Nicholas delivers the list of naughty children he's going to abduct to the Mayor, Bennie sees his chance to get to Spain, where the naughty children are taken, and adds his name to the list! In this heart-warming and quirky Netherlands take on the normally Hollywood genre of children's musical comedy, Bennie finds it frustratingly difficult to be taken seriously as a naughty boy by Santa, who, of course knows his true nature!",1458864000,,1008,4.732954545454546
