6554700,4,B00M3MCWH2,"3 1/2 TO 4 STARS FOR A COMEDY WITH FOODIE FLAIR AND CHOICE MOMENTS, BUT DOESN'T COMPLETELY DIG ITS HEELS IN

This movie is probably a little less complex and a little more mindless fun than most French films that make it to the U.S.  However, if you are willing to sit back, read subtitles and just enjoy a little chuckle worthy fun with a nice comedic pair in the leads, this movie may be for you.  To say it is for foodies is a little over simplification.  They don't always get into detail with what they are doing, though there is plenty of cooking and food based humor.

THE PLOT:  Jacky Bonnot (Michal Youn) is a young chef genius who has yet to make his name.  He knows all the famous chef's menus and recipes, practically down to the date they were served!  His particular nature is making it difficult lately for him to keep a job.  Though his girlfriend is about to have his baby, Jacky finds himself fired from one job to the next until he is painting windows outside a retirement home.  Alexandre Lagarde (Jean Reno) is a famous chef at the renowned Cargo Lagarde Restaurant which bears his name.  He even has a TV cooking show.  However, the new restaurant group CEO (along with food critics) are growing restless with Lagarde's recently stagnating menu which lacks innovation in their mind.  The young CEO has been firing chefs at other restaurants in the group and replacing them with Lagarde's staff, leaving him short handed at the critical time he is required to unveil his yearly food line up.  Through a series of odd events, Jacky meets Lagarde (who he idolizes) and is made first assistant on a trial basis.  Overshadowing it all is the new CEO's desire to convert the famous restaurant into a ""molecular cooking"", new age, fad restaurant while getting rid of Legarde for good.  Everything is very predictable and fun, off the wall at times.  It is a race to save Lagarde's reputation and star-rating while Jacky must prove to his girlfriend that he can hold a job so she will marry him.  And what will this amazing new menu be...

MOVIE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: The comedic pairing of Reno and Youn is quite terrific.  In fact, with that combination, talent, and subject matter, they probably could have delivered more than what we ultimately get.  Nevertheless, I really did find myself chuckling all the way through.  The scene where Jacky and Alexandre are disguised as a Japanese couple (Samurai and Geisha looking) is hilarious as they go to a new age ""molecular cooking"" joint to spy on their methods.  Youn absolutely shines and his fan dance is hilarious.

If you don't normally like French movies and you hate subtitles, the comedy here is probably not enough to win you over.  What they do with the menu in the end is not well defined, though as a comedy it doesn't have to be. The event is well covered.  If you are a fan of either French movies or Jean Reno, maybe give it a rent and expect some light fun!",1414195200,7,2942,4.5456273764258555

Jean Reno who is best known for big action, violent thrillers, does an amazing job as a chef.  I highly recommend this film for all Francophiles
who love cinema.  It is sooooo good, that I've already seen it twice :)",1456963200,3,341,4.380952380952381
8670059,5,B00M3MCWH2,"In response to at least one overly serious review, the mini plots in this film may not be Shakespearean classics, but then again, this movie is not London; it is Paris and Moliere and pure good natured French comedy. It's also a foodie classic!

In many ways this film is a more dignified cousin of Luis de Funez and Coulouche in Cuisse ou Aile. The most serious message is the same, cost accounting threatens classic cuisine and wholesome food, remain artisanal and respect tradition. Mikeal Youn reveals himself as a most talented clown in this role, another distant resemblance to the great Coulouche.

In short, we shouldn't judge a comedy along the same paths as we would an action film or drama.

However one should maybe be a chef oneself to appreciate the depth of this film. Great cuisine can be picture perfect yet uninspired in flavor. Jean Reno plays a Bocuse like champion who figuratively has lost his passion for culinary creation within a three star world. Youn, forgive the pun, is hungry to find a place where he can express his rapture in respecting classic cuisine in an innovative mode. His clowning revolves hilariously around the rules you break and the rules you absolutely never break. This gets him fired in just about every place he tries, all except for the very place he truly belongs, at the top.",1456876800,,1326,4.731601731601732
8670060,5,B00M3MCWH2,"I found this movie enjoyable.  The young chef does a nice job with his character and Reno is still the ""professional"".  Only if life was so easy, it would come with a warranty:  But it's good to see happy endings.",1452643200,,213,4.275
