4450188,5,B004QOB8QQ,"I ordered this via Amazon Instant (get it free with Prime memberships), and I'm still in awe.  Christopher Eccleston was so fantastic, then David Tennant (WOW, 10th doctor was just too  much fun), and now Matt Smith - also great.  I love that because it is so fast paced, I can watch them again and again since I often miss phrases in part due to the fast talking and action, and in other part due to the British slant which I'm not so familiar with to keep up so quickly.  This season does not disappoint at all - it's really different than the rest, but I guess that is what makes it so good - the series keeps growing.  This has to be my favorite TV show, period.  Wish there were more episodes, but I'm already going back to 9th Doctor and watching them all over again.  I loved the Almost People episode, but my favorite so far was The Doctor's Wife, no wait, I just love them all, no favorite episode!!",1309996800,3,908,4.244186046511628
4450189,5,B004QOB8QQ,"I've enjoyed every story of this series so far which is something I cannot say about series 1-5. Matt Smith is by far the best actor to have taken on the role of the Doctor since the show came back in 2005, and he might just be the best actor since 1963! Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor but Matt Smith is easily my second favorite by far. He is the perfect embodiment of the Doctor. He ""gets"" the character, that much was evident from his very first scene. The companions aka ""The Ponds"" have been far more 'fleshed' out this series (lol) and I am actually starting to enjoy Gillans performance which is something I had a problem with in series 5. Rory is the best male companion since Jamie McCrimmon. I will probably be waiting for the entire series 6 box set to come out (hopefully by Christmas) before I purchase anything but I can't wait for that day to come. The show is in safe hands with Moffat. Roll on Series 6 part 2!",1309478400,16,940,4.256983240223463
4450190,5,B004QOB8QQ,"For those of you sci-fi(or old Dr. Who) fans who tried watching but didn't like the show, or lost interest in the show after the 2005 premeire, this is nearly a completely different production.  The production quality, writing, casting and directing is far and away at a higher calibre, and with this past series, is not only maintaining its momentum, but is getting better.  Not to say that the show in the past was poor, it was definately watchable.  But inarguable is that the quality has changed for the better in all aspects.  Many long time fans of the show, however, are not into the darker look and tone it has taken on.  As a show marketed toward children, it is a bit scary, and touches on adult issues like morality, mortality, and sexuality in such a way as to make them more weighty than in the past.

Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but most children I know who watched the first two parter of this series, ""The Impossible Astronoaut"" and ""The Day of the Moon"" said it was a bit too scary, but were terribly interested to know what happens in the end!  I would say for the very young, or sensitive child you watch it first just to make sure, I am to the point where I have to take my neice to a film shoot so she can see that the monsters are really people wearing suits--while with the classic Who that fact was terribly obvious!

But, perhaps the fact that in the US this would NEVER be talked of as a show for children at all is indicative of our culture's problems with respecting children, and understanding that serious things do interest them, just like us adults.  That they also will appreciate quality, well written and well produced television just as any adult does.

As a note, for those that have caught this show only on BBC America broadcasts, the overall quality of the episodes is far better on the DVDs. For the discriminating veiwer, when the episodes are cut for the shorter US airtime and commercial breaks, the pacing and editing are different enough to notice.  Not to mention the commercial interruptions that are not present in its intended veiwing experience.",1308528000,4,2110,4.54089709762533
4450191,5,B004QOB8QQ,"$20.00 for the BluRays is a great buy.  TO THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HALF SEASON RELEASE - It's getting a full season release when all the episodes have aired!!!!  They're just giving you a chance to buy it sooner.  And Thank The Doctor!  I can't wait for them to arrive.

The stories have progressed nicely from one part stories to two parters, to subtle season arcs, to strong season arcs and now to an interseason arc.  The show has done this without getting anymore confusing than a good time travel show should be.  I recommend the show, and this season, to anyone who doesn't want their Science Fiction experience to be limited to Star Trek, good though it can be.",1308096000,6,677,4.545454545454546
4450192,5,B004QOB8QQ,"Episode 1: The Impossible Astronaut

Starts things off with a bang (rather literally). The word ""impossible"" in the title is well-deserved: something you would never have expected to happen really does. Feels more like a typical DW series finale in scope rather than a premiere, and makes for a nice change from the norm. Lots of new plot threads introduced, some new development added to old ones...including the revelation of the Silence, definitely the scariest monster Steven Moffat has created so far.

Episode 2: Day of the Moon

It's hard to believe after watching Episode One, but this episode is even more incredible and jaw-dropping. All the stars get a chance to stretch their acting muscles and add some layers to their characters. Plus, we're treated to what is probably the most shocking cliffhanger ever to be seen in Doctor Who.

Episode 3: The Curse of the Black Spot

Fun but forgettable. A simplistic romp which adds little to the main story arc. It's not terrible, but it falls far short of the show's usual standard of quality (which admittedly was pushed very high by the premiere).

Episode 4: The Doctor's Wife

Definitely the best of this set of episodes. It's so surprising and incredible that I can't say much about it without spoiling the genius of its premise. You aren't a true Whovian unless you've seen this, and even if you're not an avid fan, I guarantee you'll love it.

Episode 5: The Rebel Flesh

An enjoyable return to traditional Who. Very creepy ""monsters"" (though I'm not sure the term actually applies here). Thought-provoking and engaging. Plus, some things introduced in this episode will become very, very important in the future...

Episode 6: The Almost People

Even better than Part 1 (a rarity in two-part stories). Provides a satisfying, unpredictable conclusion to one of the thorniest ethical dilemmas the Doctor has yet encountered. Some of the FX are a bit over-ambitious, but that doesn't detract from the fun. And finally, we get some more plot development on the main story arc, in the form of yet another gasp-inducing cliffhanger. You really, really won't see this one coming, and you won't be able to keep yourself from watching the next episode.

Episode 7: A Good Man Goes to War

How should I put this? It's a mixed bag. The first half of the episode feels a bit like a rerun of Journey's End, and there are a few irritating bits and pieces randomly thrown in. Then the Doctor makes a mind-blowing discovery, and the second half changes everything for him and his companions - perhaps permanently. And we finally find out who the mysterious River Song is. If you've been watching very carefully thus far, and if you're the kind of person who sees the solution to mystery novels before you finish them, you may not find the revelation surprising. However, it's no less fascinating, and there will be parts of it you won't have been able to guess beforehand. In addition, we really don't find out everything about her in this episode. It'll be a long, long wait until autumn...

So overall, this first half of Series 6 gets five stars from me. We finally get some real, honest-to-goodness shocks and surprises, and all the main characters are far better developed than they were last year. Order today and enjoy.",1307836800,84,3273,4.811051693404635
4450193,4,B004QOB8QQ,I love Matt Smith as the doctor.  He is quirky and fun to watch.  I equate him to being a cross between Tom Baker and Patrick Troughton.  I'm 64 years old and never get tired of the Doctor.  Been watching his escapades for years.  I love all the stories written for Matt Smith.  I find River Song an exciting and intriguing new character.  I too feel pangs for Rory.  I read something that makes me wonder if Matt Smith is going to be replaced.  Say it isn't so!!!  I was hoping to buy the complete Seasons 5 and 6 as a package.  Maybe they will wise up.,1307664000,2,554,4.08411214953271
4450194,2,B004QOB8QQ,"BBC series' are already short (like 10-12 episodes per season). I love the show and have been a fan for years. The spin this season has seems to be geared towards drawing in American audiences, but is still entertaining. I think Neil Gaiman's episode ""the Doctor's Wife"" is my favorite since the last Christmas episode with Michael Gambon. BUT, and it is a big BUT (no puns please), Whats the deal with breaking up the seasons in to seperate discs??? Battlestar Galactica did this half way through and I refused to buy them as well. Give us one box PER season and stop milking your fan base!!  jerks!! I give it 5 stars because I like the show. This multi disc per season gets -3 stars",1306713600,16,685,4.436507936507937
4450195,5,B004QOB8QQ,"I've been watching Who since the 60s. The first time the Dalek appeared. The image burn itself to my mind even though I was probably too young to really understand the show at the time. I've kept up with Who on and off over the years till after the Baker era (those that followed Baker just isn't that good. not to blame the actors but the show itself was getting pretty long in the tooth) By the time it went off the air, I was glad it happened as the series really needs a break and maybe a fresh perspective.

I was fairly happy when the series came back in 2005. It's fresh, faster pace and edgier story was Fun. Eccleston did an pretty good job and I was caught again (not always watching live but would DVR to watch later). When Eccleston left after the 1st season and Tennant took over. It was still pretty good for the 1st couple seasons since he has great chemistry with Piper but when Piper left, the chemistry just wasn't there for Catherine Tate or Freema Agyeman so I begin to drift out again. I came back to watch the last part of the last Tennant season once I hear that Piper is coming back and the end was pretty good, But even at it's best. The new Who was just a show that I will DVR every season but was in no hurry to watch.

All that changed on 2010. Initially, I was probably like a lot of people that wasn't impressed by the few seconds of Smith that we got at ""The End of Time"". But I was willing to give it a go so I sat down and watch the season 5 premiere right after it got DVRed (I don't watch live TV so I can skip the commercials). And Smith kicked it out of the park. The story was pretty good and Smith even have good chemistry with the young Amy Pond. And his chemistry with Gillan was great with all the sexual tension. The story was pretty good and I love Smith's slightly off kilter portrayal with a dangerous edge at times. All that was enough to get me back the following week to watch the second episode and so on.

By the 3rd or 4th episode. This show had became one of the show that I have to watch on air date and at time had me hanging by a thread while waiting for the next episode. Most of the episodes are good to great and the overall season arc was very interesting. The 1st Smith season came to a great (and quite emotionally satisfying) conclusion with ""The Pandorica Opens"" and ""The Big Bang"", The Christmas special ""A Christmas Carol"" was generally viewed as one of the best of all time. The only downside was the long wait for season 6.

Season 6 opened with maybe a bigger BANG than any other seasons of all time. My jaw were kinda hanging of the floor at the 8 minute mark. And it didn't stop, the show just kept going in a train wreck pace and before you knew it, your 43 minutes is up and you have to hang for a week.

The second week came and if you think the pace will slow down for the 2nd episode. You are wrong. It opened probably just as strong as the first and my jaw was once again hanging off the floor by the end of the episode.

So the bottomline. Smith's portrayal of the Doctor have caught me in his grab melike none that came before and I will be waiting for each new episode with anticipation.",1305072000,14,3167,4.1082390953150245
4450196,5,B004QOB8QQ,"- the Doctor: ""I wear a Stetson now. Stetsons are cool.""

All hail DOCTOR WHO, back for this Series 6 and more awesome and mind-warping than ever. And this time there's a neat swerve as show boss and head writer Steven Moffat plonks the Doctor (complete with Stetson on noggin) in the American West. The Doctor's close associates - Amy Pond (the amazing Karen Gillan) and her long-suffering hubby Rory (Arthur Darvill) - each receive an invitation (in Tardis-blue envelopes) from the Doctor and off they go to rendezvous with him in a desert in Utah. The enigmatic time-traveler (and prison inmate), Professor River Song, also shows up, her own invite in hand, and to quote her now: ""SPOILERS."" They all go have a nice picnic, in the middle of which the Doctor gets murdered by an astronaut emerging from a lake. And Series 6 is off to a twisty start. That bloke, Steven Moffat, seems to think he's some sort of clever clogs, and maybe he is. Amy Pond is absolutely inconsolable; the Doctor had perished before regeneration could initiate. It looks like it's eleven and done.

The fantastic two-parter - ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"" - goes a ways into resolving certain questions left dangling from Series 5. We learn the nature of the Silence, and there are inroads made in fleshing out River Song's back story and her connection to the Doctor. As usual, this series plays fast and loose with time and space, and that's in a good way. Temporally, the venue shifts from the present to the year 1969, and, as the Doctor cautions his friends: ""A lot more happens in '69 than anyone remembers."" In 1969 the Doctor and his companions stroll into the Oval Office and meet a President Nixon early into his term and receiving constant phone calls from a terribly frightened little girl. In two episodes chock full of swerves, one of the really surprising ones is that Nixon comes across as a fairly likable guy. On two occasions he actually intervenes on our protagonists' behalf.

We learn the true reason behind man's quest to reach the moon, and also that America had long been occupied by a race of malevolent aliens, aliens that lurk in the corner of your eyes and had been surviving off man's accomplishments from the very beginning. And I'll tell the world that these boogeymen are easily as terrifying as the weeping angels. Like the weeping angels, these aliens in 1969 possess a disturbing and creepy knack for distorting perception. How the companions get around that, and how the Doctor ultimately gets the best of the aliens are simply some of the biggest grin getting experiences in my time watching this show. Matt Smith brings his usual eccentric and lively take on the Doctor, and, in his interpretation, there's a sense of an old soul inhabiting a giddy young body. And Smith really is terrific in those rousing ""Gotcha!"" moments. ""Silence will fall."" Indeed.

There are so many things to love about this two-parter. British aplomb rubs elbows with American bravado, and results in dynamic synergy. And maybe it's this more impartial perspective from overseas that lends a refreshing feel to this 1960s era. As mentioned, Nixon comes off in a good light. The episodes also benefit from the presence of FBI Agent Delaware, and the final exchange between him and Nixon in ""Day of the Moon"" is priceless. I love the notion of the two time travelers - the Doctor and River Song - having to sync up their diaries each time they meet. I love the sheer scope of the story, the ballsiness of it, and the constant shifts from chilling horror to political drama to slam bang sci-fi thriller. I also love that, unlike the ninth and tenth Doctor, this one looks to last a bit longer. At least until he meets a sinister Apollo astronaut. I'm loving Series 6 so far; these first two episodes come very strong. As usual the show thrives on the element of surprise. And if we know Steven Moffat, clever clogs that he is, there are even more epic surprises in store.

Just don't expect it from the third episode, ""The Curse of the Black Spot."" With the Tardis behaving all wonky, the Doctor, Amy, and Rory are stranded onboard a 17th century pirate ship of which crew members are being steadily decimated by a beguiling (but homicidal) sea siren. On this ship, one tiny bloody scratch spells doom. But, as usual, things aren't what they seem. Maybe the best bit in this episode is Amy Pond, sword in hand, taunting the ship's understandably cautious crew: ""What kind of rubbish pirates are ye?"" A decent episode, but not all that.

Episode 4 makes up for episode 3's lack. ""The Doctor's Wife"" raises the possibility of other living Time Lords as the Doctor and his companions track a distress signal emanating from a bubble universe. The story begins with a knock at the door even as the Tardis hurtles thru deep, deep space. ""The Doctor's Wife"" hits those wonderful emotional beats I've come to expect; and, in unexpected ways, it explores the Doctor's connection to the Tardis. I really liked this one.

Then comes the thought-provoking two-parter - ""The Rebel Flesh"" and ""The Almost People"" - which features doppelganger drones (made out of programmable living flesh) that rebel against humanity in the near-flung future. Moral implications and an exploration of identity abound, as do disconcerting doubles of our core cast. A moody, claustrophobic, and rather compelling tale of which body horror and gothic sensibilities take hard core fans back to the 1970s era of Doctor Who.

The rousing, action-packed mid-series finale, ""A Good Man Goes to War,"" reveals the long-awaited true identity of River Song and finds the Doctor contending with Cybermen and headless monks and calling in favors across the galaxy to amass his own army. All in all, a satisfactory episode to go on hiatus with. Six strong episodes out of seven so far in this supremely self-assured Series 6. Matt Smith is THE man, consistently in fine and sometimes spectacular form, even if he tends to drop phrases like ""wibbly-wobbly"" and timey-wimey.""

Not much in the way of bonus features, just these two featurettes: ""Monster Files: The Silence"" (00:10:57 minutes long) and ""Monster Files: the Gangers"" (00:13:00 minutes long).",1304812800,31,6216,4.818181818181818

4450246,5,B004QOB8QQ,"Dr Who has been a favorite series of many a sci-fi fan for over fifty years now. The new series of Dr Who is better in that it's more emotionally gripping, faster paced, more satisfying, and is just better all around in every conceivable respect. Please don't think I am trying to degrade classic Who, because classic Who is part of the legacy that has led us to this wonderful and thrilling season.

It begins with a shocking event that leads Dr Who and his companions back to 1969 and some unexpected... Alien visitors who are oddly not the least bit memorable(That's a joke, you'll get it when you watch it). The season continues with the Doctor, Amy and Rory encountering pirates and a Siren who kills off their crew one by one. We then go into curiously surreal territory with the highly loved and acclaimed episode ""The Doctor's Wife"". The next two-parter The Rebel Flesh and Almost people leads us to a shocking twist for the monumental mid-season cliffhanger ""A good man goes to war"". I've said before that A good man goes to war is basically the Dr Who equivalent of The Empire Strikes back. I stand by that statement.

Dr Who is probably my favorite show. The thing is, it keeps on changing companions and doctors and I always think that I won't like it as much because they changed this, but they just never fail to make it better and better. I was really upset when the 10th doctor left, but I immediatly liked Matt Smith and he is just getting better and better, also didn't think I would like River Song, but now that she appears more I'm sad when there is an episode without her. Anyways here's what I think of each of the 7 episodes, no spoilers.

-The Impossible astronaut and Day of the Moon: One of the best Dr. Who episodes ever! It's great that they're actually in America for once, even though they do overdo the whole ""We're Americans and were proud too be Americans alot"" thing though,(we're not really that much like that. I hope.) but it's all cheezy goodness. Also, probably my favorite enemy!!! Great idea for an enemy!

-The Curse of The Black Spot: This is definatly the weakest episode, not too exciting. You know, pirates and Doctors that are saving them.

-The Doctore Wife: Not saying anythi ng for fear of spoilers. (= Love this episode.

-The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People: Good two parter. People and thier dopplegangers. Some great funniness and good enemies.

-A Good Man goes to War: Soooo, I will not tell much except, You get to know who River Song is. yay! Excitement.

They also virtually threw away some wonderful story lines - the Tardis becoming human for example -, but would dwell for multiple episodes on ""action"" stories.  Additionally, Who's new companion, Amy, shows a very limited range, and for the first time since I began following this series, I found myself fast forwarding thru scenes, out of boredom.

The things that are still exceptional: guest appearances by  wonderful veteran British actors, and, the always surprising delightfully creative story lines. Matt Smith, is indeed a quality Actor, but not enough to save this season.

I purchased all of the previous seasons with Christopher Eggalson and David Tennet. They were great! Perfect balance of everything, to appeal to all age groups.

4450316,5,B004QOB8QQ,"Dr. Who is usually entertaining and this doctor (played by Matt Smith) was as well.

We find out who River Song is on the last episode of this blu-ray. It is a bit of a shocker when one recalls that she seems to have a relationship with the doctor, a relationship that may be intimate?  Or is she just comfortable and friendly with all the men?  Her character and the timelines are a bit convoluted.

My next comment is about the continuing dilemma with the Time Lords and Gallifrey.  Are they here anymore?  Without them, you have no backstory. You lack the framework for the TARDIS, time traveling, and the doctor.  Most probably, it's just a simple plot element and they intend to bring them back.  Still, it is annoying that the stories keep emphasizing that he is the last of his kind.

I have to comment on the violence and deaths in Dr. Who, especially on the last episode of this blu-ray.  There are too many people getting killed all the time.

4450342,5,B004QOB8QQ,"When it was announced that Series Six of Doctor Who was going to be done in two parts, my first thought was ""Battlestar Galactica"" and Universal putting out Seasons 2 and 4 in two separate sets.  It was marketing--that was my initial reaction.  But within the first ten minutes of ""The Impossible Astronaut"", we get the most shocking moment since the series rebooted in 2005, and quite possibly one of the great shocks in the history of this character and series.  What we find, as these seven episodes roll out, is that Steven Moffat...is putting a lot into the mix in this round.  We have two new alien/lifeforms brought in, the ""Is she??!?  Isn't she??!?"" mystery of Amy, a story in which Richard Nixon become a sympathetic character (Say WHAT??!?), and the evolving story of River Song.  In short, maybe I began to realize that Steven Moffat needed to create the first part, and take a break before creating the second part.
  So, we see our heroes travel back to Washington in 1969, aboard a pirate ship, board a sentinent asteroid...and take on an army (Typical Doctor).  But the complications intermingle and and mesh in a fascinating and complicated story, with the performances excellent and complimenting each other.
  In his second round as the TimeLord, Matt Smith has settled his interpretation of The Doctor.  He easily could have gone ""Tennant Lite"" in following the brilliance of David Tennant.  He did not--if anything, Smith seems more to be fleshing out the storyline of Christopher Eccelston's Ninth Doctor, the slightly more sullen and angry Doctor that he was at the opening of this reboot.  He's always a little nerdish--opening this set wearing a Stetson with Eleven's trademark declaration about what he's wearing (""Stetson's are cool...""), but always a little sad.
  Karen Gillan's return as primary Companion Amy Pond is a continual delight.  In this set, the issue of her balancing he loyalty to The Doctor with her married life.  She leans away from the trash-talking that Catherine Tate did (Save for her moment in ""The Curse Of The Black Spot""), but this storyline is a more severe tale in many ways.
  The surprise of this set is Arthur Darvill's Rory Williams.  Now a regular--and yes, he has reached Companion status--Darvill's Rory goes from being the reluctant traveller with The Doctor and Amy to being a willing--if not occasionally awkward--participant.  But it is always tempered with a great inner strength--his love for his wife, and surprising courage.
  Which brings us to Alex Kingston.  My main thought about Alex's continuing growth as River Song is...""Wow"".  Sort of amazing that Kingston and Julianna Marguiles of ""The Good Wife"" have had career resurgences years after their ""ER"" era.  Kingston brings such...verve to River.  Her beauty, humor, bawdiness, smarts--her interaction with Matt Smith on-screen is at once charming...and ominous.  The obvious highlight of this part of Season 6 is the discovery of WHO River Song is.  The issue has been talked about in many websites and chat rooms, and...unique.
  Among the guest turns that stick out, Mark Sheppard's Canton Dellaplane in the opening two episodes of the season is a keeper--a wise guy who who is ahead of his time...and Suranne Jones' Idris in ""The Doctor's Wife"", becoming a physical manifestation (And a gorgeous one at that) of the TARDIS.
  Bottom line--this (Part of the) season, with it's shocking beginning, myriad twists, and the big discovery at the end of the set is a worthwhile part of the tale; with Smith being brilliant, Gillan and Darvill developing...and Kingston becoming a very important force to this tale.  Highly recommended...",1313884800,2,3662,5.036605657237937

4450344,5,B004QOB8QQ,"People can argue over whether RTD or Moffat is a better show-runner until the cows come home, but personally, I am loving Series 6!  I can't deny that both Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant were AMAZING as the Doctor, and Matt Smith had some huge shoes to fill, but he has really created his own version of the Time-Lord and I totally understand the fans who say ""Matt Smith is my doctor.""

In terms of stories, I agree with those who criticized Series 5.  While I liked Smith as 11 right away and there were some great episodes (""Vincent and the Doctor"", ""The Lodger,"" and the two-parter ending for example), I was both unconvinced by Amy as a companion and confused/annoyed by the repeated presence of River.  But in this series, I feel everything (Amy and Rory as a couple, the Doctor's relationship with Amy, and the River/Doctor storyline) just came together perfectly.  In addition, I thought ""The Doctor's Wife"" has been the best episode since ""Blink.""  WOW.

I've been re-watching all the New Who since the hiatus began in June, and I have to say personally, I am more comfortable with the current dynamics of 11, Amy, Rory, and River than I have ever been with all previous Doc/Companion groupings (with maybe the exceptions of 9/Rose/Jack and some episodes of 10/Donna).  The one thing that really annoyed and frustrated me repeatedly during the RTD/Tennant years was the Rose/Doctor relationship, and the S4 finale cop-out left me exasperated.  This made me weary of where Amy/11 was going in the beginning of S5, but I'm very happy with the way their relationship has progressed.  I'm really loving the fact that S6 is as much about the Doctor as it is about Amy and Rory (and the spoiler that we might see how they got together as a couple makes me quite giddy :D).  Even though we saw Rose, Martha, and Donna's family during the RTD years, their presence was all about the Doctor, but here, it's about the Companions (Amy, Rory) themselves.  And I cannot wait!

With the Moff at helm for the 50th anniversary, and Captain Jack possibly coming back, I am so excited for next year and 2013.  My only regret is that since Moffat's responsible for both Doctor Who and Sherlock, my patience (and utter adoration) for both series are going through major testing! :D",1313884800,2,2279,4.707808564231738

4450367,3,B004QOB8QQ,"I have been a Doctor Who fan since 2005.  I had great hopes for seasons 5 and 6, because Steven Moffat had become the producer and lead writer.  Moffat wrote my 2 favorite stories (2-part episodes counting as 1 story) from the Russell Davies series of 2005-2009, and all 4 of his earlier stories ranked among my all-time top 12 for the modern and classic series combined.  Unfortunately, the first two Moffat seasons did not live up to my expectations, for several reasons.

Concept of the show:  The 4 Moffat stories from the Russell Davies era conformed to Davies' conception of the show and the character of the Doctor.  Davies viewed Doctor Who as a science fiction show, a la Star Trek.  Moffat views Doctor Who as a fairy tale.  I prefer science fiction.  Both of the Davies incarnations of the Doctor - Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant - were serious characters.  Eccleston played the Doctor as intense, enigmatic, very lonely, self-doubting, and angry over the total destruction of his fellow Time Lords in the Time War.  In his David Tennant incarnation, the Doctor largely got over his anger, but his seemingly light-hearted banter covered up a deep loneliness and sadness, combined with steely determination.  In his current incarnation, the Doctor is just silly and undignified - a madman with a blue box.  Also, in his interactions with his primary companion - Amy Pond - he comes across as hen-pecked.  Good grief!  Also, the repeated ""Hello sweetie"" stuff with River Song has become tiresome.  Many jokes are only funny once.  I must say, however, that the silliness of the Smith Doctor has been declining in recent episodes.

Quantity versus quality:  During the Russell Davies era, Moffat wrote a total of 4 stories and 6 weekly installments.  Moffat is currently writing about 5 weekly installments per year for Doctor Who, plus a couple more for his other show (Sherlock), and is acting as producer for both shows.  This does not allow him to devote enough time to each episode that he writes.  Moffat needs to cut his number of weekly installments to about 4 per year (for both shows combined) and recruit better writers (see below) to generate the remainder of the episodes.

Inferior ""secondary"" writers:  In my opinion, the following writers accounted for the top 10 stories from the Russell Davies era:  Steven Moffat (4, out of the 4 he wrote), Paul Cornell (2, out of 2), Davies (2, out of 25 (31 weekly installments)), Robert Shearman (1, out of 1), and Toby Whithouse (1, out of 1).  Stories number 11 through 15 came from Russell Davies (4) and Matt Jones (1, out of 1).  (However, Davies might have written better stories had he confined himself to fewer episodes per year.)  Whithouse provided 1 weekly installment per year in seasons 5-6; Cornell, Davies, Shearman, and Jones combined for ZERO.  Moffat should recruit some of the other good writers from 2005-2009 and get Neil Gaiman (see below) to write more than 1 weekly installment next year.

Fixation with time-loop paradoxes:  Moffat's first story - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - was a superb example of the ""Doctor solving a problem"" type of story.  Moffat's other three stories from the 2005-2009 series all dealt with time-loop paradoxes.  These episodes all worked well, especially ""Blink,"" but this was partially because such episodes were ""different.""  Having such episodes account for the bulk of a season, as they do now, is tedious and confusing.  How much of season 5 actually happened after the last episode erased most of the season?  Will the same thing happen at the end of season 6?

General tone of the season 6:  Season 6 is darker and scarier than earlier seasons, and has more emphasis on morally complex or ambiguous themes (e.g., Amy's continuing interest in the Doctor even though she is married to Rory).  Also, the Doctor seems perfectly willing to let River Song shoot people/monsters, whereas earlier incarnations of the Doctor were gun-shy (except for Christopher Eccleston when he encountered Daleks).

Specific episodes from the first half of season 6:  1) The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon.  This is a genuinely creepy story, Moffat's best since the David Tennant era (Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead).  Despite my general unease about ""time paradox"" stories, this one has an ingenious ""time loop"" plot twist at the beginning (which I will not reveal).  Also, the aliens are a scary new enemy - will they be back?  I disliked a couple of things about the story, which prevented me from putting it in my all-time top 10.  First, I really hated it when River Song shot the Doctor's Stetson hat off.  This was supposed to be funny, but I found it merely stupid.  Second, former president Richard Nixon played a significant role in the story, and was portrayed very poorly.  The actor did not look like Nixon, did not sound like Nixon, and captured nothing of Nixon's character.  He was just a ""generic president.""  2) The Curse of the Black Spot.  This was a silly 18th century pirate episode, loosely inspired by Pirates of the Caribbean, but without Johnny Depp.  This is right down there with ""Victory of the Daleks"" as the worst story of the Moffat era.  3) The Doctor's Wife.  This is the best story written by anyone other than Moffat since Human Nature/Family of Blood (Paul Cornell) back in season three of the Davies era.  This is a clever story where the soul of the Tardis inhabits the body of a woman.  Hopefully, Neil Gaiman will write two or three weekly installments next year.  4) The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People.  This is a surprisingly good - and thought provoking - story about the nature of humanity and slavery.  Much like the movie Blade Runner, it deals with artificially created human-like beings that are exploited.  5) A Good Man Goes to War.  This is part one of a two-part story.  This is one of Moffat's worst episodes.  It is much too fast-paced and confusing, and provides little understanding of what is going on or why.  It might have made a good 2-part episode or 90-minute special.  It also gives away the secret of River Song's true identity.  It probably would have been better to keep the secret until part 2 of this episode debuts later.",1313020800,5,6224,4.825922421948912

4450370,4,B004QOB8QQ,"Judge Michael Stailey, DVD Verdict-- What a difference a hiatus makes! Whereas everything about Doctor Who: Series Five was fresh, new, and optimistically enchanting; Series Six is drenched in darkness, secrets, and raw unbridled emotion. Nothing is what it appears and your head is bound to hurt trying to make sense of certain aspects, but the ride is no less entertaining.

The opening two-part story--""The Impossible Astronaut"" / ""Day of the Moon""--is a trip. Literally. The gang packs up and relocates to the United States for a tale that introduces us to a new (albeit quiet ancient) spieces the likes of which only the twisted mind of Steven Moffat could provide. Think the Weeping Angels were creepy? Wait until you get to know The Silence.

Given there are only seven episodes in the first half of this series, there's not much time to waste on extraneous adventures. Yet sandwiched between two crucial two-parters are what may well be considered throwaway episodes...or not. Doctor Who doesn't often pander to popular culture, but one can't help think this may be the impetus behind ""The Black Spot."" Capitalizing on the worldwide love for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (box office, not critical), The Doctor, Amy (Karen Gillan), and Rory find themselves stranded aboard a pirate ship with a skeleton crew being tormented by a bloodthirsty siren.

On the other hand, if Doctor Who didn't allow for these thematic pit stops, we never would have encountered ""The Doctor's Wife,"" author Neil Gaiman's first (and hopefully not last) foray in this world. In all sincerity, I have not seen an episode with so much reverence for a franchise that can also propel its 40+ year mythology into brash and bold new directions. Without question, it's the highlight of this set and a breakout performance for Suranne Jones (Coronation Street).

 ""The Rebel Flesh"" and ""The Almost People"" uncover a huge piece of the larger puzzle, but do so in a long drawn out way. Since ""A Good Man Goes to War"" is arguably part three of this tale, the triad could have easily been boiled down into a meatier experience.

Presented in 1.78:1 1080i widescreen, the image is just as sharp and mesmerizing as was broadcast on BBC America HD. Eagle eyes will likely point out a handful of flaws here and there, but that's nitpicking at best. The colors exude emotion, be it the warmth of the TARDIS, the blackness of space, the green evil of House, or the magnificence of Monument Valley. And the visual effects continue to improve by leaps and bounds. I don't know if Moffat has scored a bigger budget from the BBC or the artistry of his production team grows by the day, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more convincing sci-fi series. As for the DTS-HD 5.1 surround mix, it may be step down from true Master Audio, but none but the techiest of viewers will notice. Between the ambient effects and Murray Gold's score, your system will thrill you and annoy the neighbors, if given the chance.

Bonus materials are sparse, as seems to be the trend with this partial season releases. All you'll find here are two Monster File featurettes, one on The Silence, the other on The Gangers (Flesh), both of which run about 11 min. Seems like we'll have to wait for the complete Series Six box set to get the full treatment, which includes all of the Doctor Who Confidential episodes, plus interviews, commentaries, and other behind-the-scenes treats. Until then, you can rewatch these episodes in anticipation of ""Let's Kill Hitler"" on August 27.

4450371,5,B004QOB8QQ,"Today, July 26'th 2011, is a sad sad day. I have finished yet another batch of Doctor Who episodes! Now I am forced to wait, yet again, for a continuation of what is arguably the most inventive, creative, inspiring television show today.

Doctor Who Season 6 brings everything to the table a Who-fan would come to expect; you've got very interesting episodes all featuring a new story, intertwined by an underlying story that climaxes as the series progresses. Many questions are answered and, of course, even more questions are raised.

I do feel as though the show has been tailored a bit towards Matt Smith's style, though I can assure you this is not a bad thing. Every Doctor has their own ""thing"" that makes you fall in love with them; Christopher Eccleston with his ""Fantastic!"" catch phrase, very enthusiastic voice, and strong emotion for Rose. David Tennant with his unique mannerisms, ""Allons-y!"", and admiration of his own brilliance. Matt Smith with his ""*insert object here*'s are cool!"", his insistence on calling Amelia, ""Pond"", regardless of the fact she's married, and his love for both Rory and Amy. This series is the scariest, most thrilling of them all, so watch out for that...!

The trio of Amy, Rory, and the Doctor balance out much better in this series than in the previous. I've always felt that the drama between the Doctor and Rory fighting over Amy was silly. It was a little too outlandish; even for Doctor Who. However, they've stabilized that, allowing for them all to get along perfectly. Amy has her heart in the right place, knowing that although the Doctor will always be there, Rory will always be her Roranicas, her Roman in shining armor. The girl and boy who waited. I find this flows much better, and you can tell the Doctor respects this when he first asks Rory if it's ok if he hugs Amelia Pond.

Also, a special treat is in store for you in the final episode of this collection. I don't want to state too much and ruin it for you, but I will say I'm certain you will enjoy the final episode very, very much.

So we see new creatures, reunite with some old ones, find out shocking things about main characters, and the ride just goes on and on. The ending is well played. I was a little concerned that, this being a part 1 set, they would end in a silly manner, but honestly they made it so it's basically a short season within itself. You've got a really big, climactic ending that answers and brings up a bunch of questions, but doesn't end in the middle of a story (or at least, not in a really bad spot). It's a good enough place to stop, until future episodes are released, which I really appreciated.

All in all, an amazing continuation of an already incredible series. Thank you very much Doctor Who, keep up the great work! Allons-y!",1311638400,2,2787,4.575150300601202
4450372,5,B004QOB8QQ,"Thank you Mr. Moffat for this wonderful homage to NASA's Space Age! So the Economist declared the Space Age over on their cover few weeks ago, Atlantis has retired,and we have to beg the Russians for a ride to the Space Station?!
Neil Armstrong has to plea in newspapers for the continuation of Space programs?! And we watch BBC for great sci-fi!
What happened? We fell asleep at the wheel?
Where did we take a Left Turn?! Can we please go back to the reality where Neil Armstrong is our hero and we have money to go to Mars?!
This is DrWho at its' best and the timing couldn't be better! We need more visionaries to have kids get out of Facebook and watch the stars again!!!
The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon are great pieces of Sci-fi, the Silence can stand up to the Angels as far as scariest creatures ever! The episodes are paying tribute to the X-Files, and the script is extraordinary, the atmosphere is a little darker, but humor abounds too,there are some great new characters, I don't want to spoil too much, makes one President much funnier than I'm sure he was!!!
I've been a fan of Matt Smith since he was picked, what I would like to add is that ever since Steven Moffat took the reins, the situation and the characters( ie the script) took center stage. Remember how the camera used to embrace David Tennant's face? His expressive eyes were gleaming in close ups?! Matt Smith is a brilliant actor, capable of huge emotional depth, I just wish they would focus on that a little more too, Mr. Moffat, give him a little more room to spread his wings!!! Bring on more of the dark depths of this Time Lord!
Great sci-fi should rock your world, make us all wonder where we come from and where we're headed! Should move a kid to go out there with a flashlight and a map of stars (better yet Stellarium nowadays) and gaze and get lost in the splendor!
Thank you for keeping alive that spirit of enthusiasm and making explorers heroes again!",1311465600,,1958,4.441666666666666
4450373,1,B004QOB8QQ,"I can't say exactly why but Dr Who just doesn't garb my interest anymore.  Is it the writer, the producer, the directors? I just don't know. But this is sad. This is the first season that I just don't care to watch once. And I have a hundred or so episodes that I have watched over again many many times.",1311292800,7,304,4.066666666666666
4450374,4,B004QOB8QQ,"This two-disc set contains the first 7 episodes from Season (Series) 6 of ""Doctor Who."" The video quality, while 1080i rather than 1080p, is nevertheless excellent. Audio quality is equally solid whether played through standard t.v. speakers or through a surround sound system. Another review here suggested that this was a ""vanilla"" release, which is mostly quite right. There are two supplements presented with the set; two ""Monster Files"" each about 12 minutes long about two of the creatures featured in four of the episodes, one on ""the silence"" and the other about ""the gangers."" Hopefully whatever extras are produced for any ""Complete Series 6"" set released at some point in the future will also be included with the second half of Series 6 which will undoubtedly be released later this year. Given that this set is available for about $20 it seems like an excellent deal to me and I am happy with the purchase. Had this set included the ""prequel"" shorts shown on BBC and made available on the BBC official ""Doctor Who"" website prior to original transimission (one for ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and another for ""Curse of the Black Spot"") along with perhaps a few more extras the set would have easily achieved a five star rating from me.",1311033600,8,1246,4.882075471698113

The find print says Dolby, but I got my 2 disc set in the mail today after pre-ordering and the actual episodes are DTS-HD audio only.  The menu is in Dolby, but once the episode starts, no audio.... Bummer.....

I guess I really will have to upgrade my home theater audio sooner rather than later.",1310947200,3,393,4.492957746478873
4450376,2,B004QOB8QQ,"I'm not going to critique the episodes themselves...people have already done that. What I'm going to focus on is the release itself. True fans, this is just the ""vanilla"" pack. Notice that there are no extras, no commentaries, and it doesn't even include the 2010 Christmas special. Granted, it's dirt cheap, but you get what you pay for.

I for one will wait until they release the entire set, all 14 episodes, with the Confidentials, the episode prequels, the commentaries, and all the other goodies. Frankly, if you don't get those, then why should you pay for something you could just as easily torrent?",1310256000,84,607,4.836538461538462

This problem also pertains to other Dr. Who specials like, ""Planet of the Dead"" and ""Waters of Mars"" If you live in region 1, Amazon will refund if your DVD player does not play region 2, but it's a pain in the rear. If you live in region 1 and collect Dr. Who, don't expect to add season 6 and specials to your collection. Amazon needs to get this right.",1499990400,2,683,4.097014925373134
