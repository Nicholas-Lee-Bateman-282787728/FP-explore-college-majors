8198630,5,B000R34U7O,I have been enjoying the cd of Gorecki' s Third Symphony since it was first introduced into this country.  This film is both historically documentative and yet offers a clarion call to all about our future.  Dawn Upshaw's lovely voice is the perfect haunting backdrop for this tribute to the survivors of the Holocaust.,1390089600,,319,4.888888888888889
8198631,5,B000R34U7O,"It is indeed sorrowful.  After all these years, I finally was able to get involved in the holocaust memory.  It was so terrible.  This is a must for my collection.",1372032000,,163,4.366666666666666
8198632,2,B000R34U7O,"I cannot express how disappointed I am with this film.  I love Gorecki, I teach his music in my history classes and analyze this work in my harmony classes.  When I heard that there was a film, I was happy and intrigued, I looked forward to something I could show the GE history class.  I agree with the previous reviewer, this is all about craft and weird lighting for the orchestra and Ms. Upshaw.  I hated how the interviews interspersed with the music.  Why, is the music not engaging enough on its' own?  The interviews should have been bonus features.  I was really upset about the last movement here is why, the text is about a mother losing her son in a violent uprising in Poland, yet the video shows the horrors of starvation in Africa.  Again, why?  The text does not deal with that at all.  I believe that we should ALL be aware of the troubles that continent has suffered and help as best we can, but again the text is NOT about that.  This is the nightmare of post-modernism to the extreme, ""Hey, we have some 'sad' music, let's show some random suffering that has nothing to do with the text, nor the composer's intentions.""  This brilliant, beautiful, and transcendent work deserves a great film, unfortunatley, this is not it.",1331856000,12,1243,4.524663677130045
8198633,2,B000R34U7O,"I like the Gorecki 3rd but, in one of his characteristically excessive moments Tony Palmer really goes over the top here. Passages of a filmed version with Dawn Upahaw and David Zimnan are seen with pictures from WW2 and famine in Africa. I know we have to be aware of all this but Palmer's use of this footage is unnecessary. The music speaks for iteslf. Palmer shows scenes from the Holocaust even though Gorecki himself said that his music is not about that. The movie is more about Palmer and his overblown ideas about cinema. Gorecki is really secondary. Also many of the moments with Upshaw are in shadow. Stupid, really stupid. Listen to the CD (that has sold over 1 million copies) but avoid this dreadful film.",1281052800,6,719,4.625
8198634,5,B000R34U7O,"I first saw this on Bravo TV on the South Bank Show, and taped it off the air at the time. I purchased it from a British source when the DVD was released there last year, and watch it repeatedly. The interviews with the composer are integrated with the performance, and add to, rather than detract from that performance. Contemporary film of Gorecki in Katowice, and in Asuchwicz/Birkenau is integrated with archival ( and horrific ) footage of the Holocaust, and with Gorecki's remembrances of his childhood experiences there. Particularly striking to me is the footage of Dawn Upshaw. Her facial expressiveness during the performance reflects perfectly the emotion of the musical moment. This is a film which amplifies the emotional impact of the piece which it illustrates.",1204416000,18,776,5.0703125
