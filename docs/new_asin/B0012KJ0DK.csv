3091378,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Finn (Matthew McConaughey) is a treasure hunter and goofball who believes he has found the location to a hidden treasure.  His now ex wife Tess, (Kate Hudson) is a historian who believes that Finn has no real proof of the treasures existence.  Mere coincidence lands them both on millionaire Nigel Honeycutt's (Donald Sutherland) yacht.  After some explaining to Honeycutt, the duo decide to seek out the treasure and are in a race against time to find it before their enemies do.

""Fool's Gold"" is a mildly entertaining movie.  It has something for everyone: some comedy, action/adventure, romance, and for the ladies, Matthew McConaughey shirtless.  Though a romantic comedy the action scenes are pretty decent, especially towards the end.  Some will get a kick out of this movie and some won't.  My advice, go rent it.",1213574400,,821,5.029629629629629
3091379,1,B0012KJ0DK,"Matthew McConaughey is not an actor.  He is an arrogant criminal who happens to be attractive.

Kate Hudson is the daughter of mildy talented Goldie Hawn.

These two rotten apples,  mixed with a silly screenplay make for one horrible film.  The predictability is overt.

The cinematography confuses the ""gold"" with the skin coloring of the spray tans on screen.

This film is the ""Swept Away"" mixed with ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" for the year.  It's just plain ole' dumb.  Don't waste your time.",1213315200,8,496,4.879518072289157
3091380,2,B0012KJ0DK,"There are a certain number of events you can count on in any McConaughey movie.  Among these are:
- his shirt will be off for at least 60% of the movie
- he'll be the rebellious, troublemaker to balance the determined, down
  to earth female lead
- the ""action"" will be less than spectacular
- humor is mild and watered down to the point that you'll wonder if
  they're even attempting to make you laugh
- he'll take his shirt off at the most inappropriate times... wait did I
  do this one already?

Anyways, ""Fool's Gold"" is a mediocre at best action / ""comedy"" with a big cast that largely fails to deliver.  Formulaic and uninteresting, the movie might be watchable on a dull sunday afternoon if shown on TV, but I would stay away from buying or renting the DVD.",1213315200,9,766,4.375886524822695
3091381,4,B0012KJ0DK,"It was actually a pretty good flick to pass a couple of hours despite the bad reviews, sure it's a forgettable movie and a clich story but it's entertainment and it kept me entertained, that's fine with me. I think it's good for us to watch a silly movie like this every now and then, keeps you lighthearted. Good action and some really funny parts so it gets 4 stars from me.

As a curious side note, how did this get a PG-13 rating?! There's some strong curse words, violence at times and some boobs lol, doesn't bother me but I was curious about that.",1212883200,2,554,4.276190476190476
3091382,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Matthew McConaughey goes shirtless
2. Kate Hudson channels her mom
3. He's irresponsible
4. She's determined
5. They're divorced
6. They're going treasure hunting
7. You can guess the ending before watching the opening credits

In other words, there's nothing new about this light and ditzy treasure hunting romp that plays heavily on stereotyping and McConaughey's shirtless bod.

The legend behind the treasure is interesting enough. Forty chests of gold and jewels, destined to be a dowry fit for an eighteenth century queen, was lost without a trace during the hurricane season of 1715.  Finn (McConaughey) and Tess (Hudson) had been searching for it for years, until an accidental discovery clues them in that they're finally on the right track.

With the exception of Donald Sutherland, the movie loses momentum whenever the supporting actors are on-screen and the burden of the caricaturized characters sink the movie even deeper than the plotline.

The action scenes were good, especially at the end, and although there is violence, most of it is off camera.  A couple of swear words and a few naughty scenes make for a PG-13 movie that should be found guilty of breach of promise.

3091383,5,B0012KJ0DK,If you like How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days you'll love this movie. A bit slow at one point but it picked back up. My husband and I laughed at the silly comedy in the movie. It was fun seeing two people and how different they were at times but the relationship still works. Great Flick.,1211932800,4,284,3.913793103448276
3091384,1,B0012KJ0DK,"I swear I cannot recall a more boring ""adventure"" movie in my whole life. In spite of the ""cool"" actors, the tropical set, the intrigues about pirates and treasures the movie is ""the"" perfect sleeping pill. There is not a single exciting, adventurous or romantic minute in the whole length of it. It makes one feel uncomfortable to see Donald Sutherland trying to navigate this rubbish nonsense. Unless you really desperately need a cure for imsomnia, avoid it at all costs.",1210377600,4,474,4.864197530864198
3091385,4,B0012KJ0DK,"I saw this movie on my first date with some dude. I saw the movie and it was cute and not as predictable as most are and not sappy. Anywho, It depends what fits your fancy but this was a okay film for me and my date to watch. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the ending since his wife called me saying I was dating her husband and he was cheating on her with me. Talk about a way to end a date, A black eye and a car keyed. *his not mine* Kinda makes me feel like what Kate Hudson felt everytime she was betrayed. Anywho, I cant wait for the dvd to come out so I can watch it with BETTER company. I always thought Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson make a cute couple XD",1210291200,2,664,3.925925925925926
3091386,5,B0012KJ0DK,"If you love Matthew Mc Conaughey and Kate Hudson, this film is irresistible!!!Only these two could have pulled off these roles. Their chemistry is off-the-charts and they make the plot fun.

The film is set in beautiful tropical locales as Kate and Matthew pursue lost treasure and----each other. They even reuse a prominent line from ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". It's too cute...

This movie is not meant to be serious in any way. You can't bring yourself to be afraid of the villain---a ficticious rapper named Bigg Bunny. He lends comic relief. It has to be said that Sutherland was great in his role as well.

If you are expecting a super-suspenseful action movie, you won't like this. But if you have a sense of humor and enjoy great scenery and these two actors, get yourself some Fool's Gold. :0)",1210291200,5,806,4.583333333333333

3091414,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Benjamin Finnegan (Matthew McConaughey) in search a ship wreck with gold and other treasure alienates his wife Tess (Kate Hudson,) defaults on a loan from the local bad guy Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) and misplaces a boat.

Yet he finds a clue to the treasure and must placate Bigg Bunny, regain the appreciation of his wife, find a sugar daddy to finance his expedition and beat a rival to the claim. The sugar daddy turns out to be Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland). Nigel is on his own quest to regain if he ever had it the affection of his flibbertigibbet daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena.)

Who will find the treasure (if there really is one)?
Will love or at least lust reappear to our forlorn treasure hunting couple?

3091416,4,B0012KJ0DK,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Many funny scenes, physical, situational, and verbal. I'd regard it in similar terms with McConnahey's other treasure movie, Sahara.

I had the advantage of liking the ocean, diving, and movies about treasure hunting. If you do too, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.

The acting is solid throughout, the scenery is gorgeous, and the steps to solving the treasure mystery are both captivating and not nearly as 'out there' as in some other treasure hunting movies.

You might have to forgive a couple of diving gaffes (being near an underwater explosion, even small, is pretty much going to kill you or at least ruin your hearing, but most adventure movies have a few factual errors like that. If you held them all accountable for them you'd never watch another one.",1508976000,5,808,4.875912408759124

3091450,3,B0012KJ0DK,This is a good movie that can be watched over and over.  Matthew McConaughey plays kind of a laid back guy who just wants to do his own thing and be left alone.  Kat Hudson plays his wife who wants a divorce.  He's a treasure hunter who thinks he's own to something big.  Alexis Dziena who I didn't know who she was until this.  Looks like she's about 14 but knows the power she has over guys.  And Donald Sutherland plays her rich Father.  I don't remember which movie came out first.  But this came out about the same time as Into The Blue.  And is it just me.  Or does there seem like there is a rivalry between Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba and their bikini's.,1490313600,,663,4.149606299212598

Having been to Key West I was looking forward to seeing some familiar locations and reminiscing over a lovely vacation, but was disappointed when I didn't recognize anything. This is because the movie was filmed in Australia due to hurricane season. But wow the locations are beautiful!  If you have been to Key West and are familiar with Mel Fisher a lot of things will seem familiar.  The character Moe Fitch is loosely based on him. Kevin Hart's character is a little annoying (who could ever take him seriously as a gangster?) but overall this movie is pretty fun.",1439251200,,738,4.825396825396825

3091581,1,B0012KJ0DK,"Fool's Gold is the second film that teams up Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson after appearing together in How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. In this romantic comedy,the find together playing a divorced couple who rekindle their marriage while searching for a lost treasure. Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena co-star. Andy Tennant directs.

Well,there is nothing really to say about this movie as it fails on every level. The characters are developed that we simply don't care about them particularly Benjamin and Tess. The audience probably do not care whether they get back together or not. Also,we don't care as well whether they find the treasure or not. We know what's going to happen in the end as it was predictable from beginning to end. Definitely,one may find it too long. What's worse,there isn't any funny moment in it as the gags were practically humorless. Finally,there is nothing really good going for the film except the charm and appeal of McConaughey and Hudson. If you find their first film together bad,you'll probably find this worse.",1433721600,,1055,4.96045197740113

3091709,5,B0012KJ0DK,"FOOL'S GOLD [2008] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] True Love Takes A Dive!

Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson go for the gold, the diamonds, emeralds and rubies. As a just-divorced couple who bicker and banter their way through an adventure and laugh-packed undersea treasure hunt. Mathew McConaughey is Finn, in love with his ex [Kate Hudson] and in deep with gangster Bigg Bunny. After eight years of searching, Finn gets a clue to the whereabouts of the Queen's Dowry, a fabulous fortune that mysteriously disappeared in the Caribbean in 1715. Now all he has to do is get the gold, get the girl and get going before Bigg Bunny gets him. Directed by Andy Tennant's Fool's Gold' glitters with danger, action, romance, comedy, great one-liners and a great time to be had by all!

FILM FACT: Warner Bros. and director Andy Tennant planned to shoot the film in the Caribbean, but decided on Queensland, Australia because the hurricane season in the Caribbean was likely to stall production of the film. The Key West scenes were filmed in Port Douglas.[citation needed] Filming also took place in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Lizard Island, Airlie Beach, and Hervey Bay. Scenes were also filmed at Batt Reef, where Steve Irwin died from a stingray barb in 2006. Inside scenes were shot on a sound stage at the Warner Bros studio facility and the actors and crew stayed in luxury homes and apartments on the Gold Coast. McConaughey mentioned having a python in the backyard of his house in Port Douglas. Matthew McConaughey said, ""There were other days like the day we went out diving and swam with a dugong, which was very cool. Two crew members were stung by Irukandji jellyfish during filming, so some of the water scenes were shot in the Caribbean because the actors were so frightened. At the time of filming, The Precious Gem luxury motor yacht in the film was called the Keri Lee and has subsequently been renamed ""Penny Mae"". It was designed by yacht architect Ward Setzer of Setzer Design Group and originally named Status Quo.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: About Five years ago, Hollywood paired Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and the match rewarded the filmmakers with box office receipts exceeding $100 million. No doubt the hope was that a reunion of these two in a script intended to recall Romancing the Stone would reap similar benefits. Now the actors are reunited in this rom-com film Fool's Gold and do not have such a negative attitude like most of the critics who slated this film, I on the other hand love it.

The film follows Ben Finnegan [Mathew McConaughey], better known to his friends as 'Finn,' a rascal of a treasure hunter who is obsessed with finding the wreck of an old Spanish boat off of the coast of southern Florida. When the boat he was loaned from a gangster named Bigg Bunny [Kevin Hart] sinks, he finds himself on the receiving end of some nastiness from a pair of dreadlocked hit-men, one of whom is Malcolm Jamal Warner from The Cosby Show. He escapes from them just in time to make it to the courthouse where his wife, Tess [Kate Hudson] has divorced him. They begrudgingly decide to go their separate ways and be done with it, but you just know that isn't going to last.

When, seemingly by fate, Fin finds himself saved by the boat of a wealthy man named Nigel Honeycutt [Donald Sutherland] and his daughter Gemma Honeycutt [Alexis Dziena], he's surprised to find Tess working on board. Of course, Finn convinces everyone to join him on his treasure hunt and they all rush to find the loot before a competing group of treasure hunters or the aforementioned gangsters can beat them to it.

Donald Sutherland is mildly amusing in his supporting role as the wealthy yacht owner and Alexis Dziena is at least fun to look at but really, not a single actor or actress in this film delivers anything even close to a memorable performance. At 112 minutes in length to a lots of critics they felt the film was far too long for its own good, well I loved it all the way to the very end and watching the film gave you chance to get to know the foibles of all the characters.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Fool's Gold' is brought to you on Blu-ray in a stunning awesome 1080p encode image, plus a really brilliant 2.40.1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The image quality is a bit of a mixed bag here. Most of the film takes place on or around the ocean and so there's a lot of blue on the screen at all times. There are some nice lush locations used and the colours really should pop off the screen - and they do... a little too much. The blues are a bit overdone as are some of the yellows and oranges and the picture winds up looking kind of fake. Flesh tones look a bit waxy in spots and darker levels loose some fine shadow detail. Now, this is probably the look that the filmmakers were going for - the film really does feel sun-drenched and tropical for much of its run time. There are parts of the movie that look nice and clean and sharp and natural.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Standard definition 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound options are provided in English, French and Spanish with optional subtitles available in the same three languages. While there aren't any problems with this perfectly acceptable standard DVD mix, it would have been nice to see Warner Bros. take advantage of the possibilities that Blu-ray offers. Surrounds are well used and dialogue stays clean and clear from start to finish. There aren't any problems with hiss or distortion and everything is well balanced. That said, it doesn't provide the same level of depth that a good 5.1 Dolby TrueHD or 5.1 DTS-HD mix does and because of that it's a bit of a disappointment in that regard. The audio here is fine but it really should have and could have been much better.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2008] [480i] [2:16] This is little more than a couple of minutes of goofy flubs from the cast and we get a brief documentary entitled

Special Feature: Fool's Gold: Flirting With Disaster [2008] [480i] [3:54] Which looks at the chemistry and working relationship shared between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. This is pretty superficial stuff and it lends exactly zero insight into the making of the film despite input from the two stars as well as Donald Sutherland and director Andy Tennant. Both of these documentaries are presented in standard definition.

Finally, `Fool's Gold' cinematography is pretty breath-taking. An early scene with Finn's burning boat... then the sinking of the boat... is very well staged well and is probably the funniest moment in the film. The score is fun and in keeping with the tone of the film. There are definitely some effects and scope that announces there's money behind this production, but it doesn't do anything to elevate it's enjoy ability. Australia was used to sub for the Bahamas and that has jaw dropping crystal clear water landscape is used to great effect, but it looks pretty damn good. After reading countless crass critics lambasting's this production, it adds itself in this reviewer's mind - to a number of films that are savaged unnecessarily. No, it's not a masterpiece, but is that the benchmark we critics are expecting for a film to be enjoyable? I hope not, I wonder what they're all expecting from this film. I originally saw Matthew McConaughey's stunning film `SAHARA', which I also really loved and I understand this film is a companion to it, well as I say I loved this film and again I don't know why so many critics are so negative towards this film, as it is just a massive gigantic ""rom-com"" film with beautiful lush exotic landscapes and I personally think the other pompous critics are totally wrong about this film and to me I am honoured to have this brilliant funny 112 minute film in my Blu-ray Collection and I will not have any negative comments said about this film. Highly Recommended!

3091746,5,B0012KJ0DK,"Sure, Kate Hudson is cute in her own kind of way, but the 'real' acting that went on was with the characters portrayed and dynamics of both Matthew Mcconaughey and by Alexis Dziena (YUM!)...

The movie featured a great storyline, mystery, intrigue, emotion, playful banter, and a bit of adventure as everyone is out trying to find a sunken ship.

But let's be clear. This movie is carried by fantastic and amazing scenery, on a beautiful yacht, and combine that with the sex appeal of two gorgeous actresses and Donald' Pleasance's contribution...

I cannot give this romance comedy more recommendations. It's such a fun and lighthearted tale of the complexities of love and the interference simply living your life by your passions can throw your way.

And Alexis.... Broken Flowers for 'more' of her ;-)",1401840000,,805,4.940740740740741

Kate Hudson is an excellent actress and excels in whatever role she plays.

There's not enough tension for this to succeed as an action/adventure film, not enough humor for it to work as a comedy, and the romance fails in two respect. First, the violence and gore from the ""action/adventure"" parts of the script make the romance seem creepy.

3091855,4,B0012KJ0DK,"""Fool's Gold"" is great! This is how the story goes: Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan is a good-natured, surf bum-turned-treasure hunter who is obsessed with finding the legendary 18th century Queen's Dowry--40 chests of exotic treasure that was lost at sea in 1715. In his quest, Finn has sunk everything he has, including his marriage to Tess Finnegan and his more-rusty-than-trusty salvage boat, ""Booty Calls."" Just as Tess has begun to rebuild her life, working aboard a mega-yacht owned by billionaire Nigel Honeycutt, Finn discovers a vital clue to the treasure's whereabouts. Certain that his luck will change with the newfound information, Finn maneuvers himself aboard Nigel's yacht and, using his good-natured charm, convinces the tycoon and his Blackberry-wielding, celebutante daughter, Gemma, to join him in the pursuit of the Spanish treasure. Against Tess' better judgment, the search rekindles her love... of discovery. But they are not the only ones after the treasure. Finn's mentor-turned-nemesis Moe Fitch has also set out to claim the prize. The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Finn) and Kate Hudson (as Tess), both who also starred in ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" (2003) is great! The directing by Andy Tennant (who also directed ""Hitch"" (2005) & ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (2002) is great! The story by John Clafin & Daniel Zelman is great! The screenplay by Clafin, Zelman, & Tennant is great! The music by George Fenton (who also did the music to ""Hitch"" & ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to ""Enchanted"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Troy Takaki & Tracey Wadmore-Smith (both who also did the film editing to ""Hitch"" & ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is great! The casting by Juel Bestrop & Seth Yanklewitz (both who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Drillbit Taylor"" (2008) is great! The production design by Charles Wood (who also did the production design to ""Amazing Grace"" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Damien Drew (who also did the art direction to ""Superman Returns"" (2006) is excellent! The costume design by Ngila Dickson (who also did the costume design to ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) and won the Oscar for her work on ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" (2003) is excellent!

Kate was really good in Almost Famous, but other than that I haven't been blown away by her or Matthew for that matter, in fact, I can't even think of him ever not playing some dolt without his accent. This movie harkens back to something like Overboard with its chemistry of two stars who would seem like an odd pair from different walks of life. While Matthew is no Kurt Russell, I think Kate is better than her mother ever was. So these two have pretty good chemistry together and then you shoot this movie in the best parts of Australia with great actors like Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart and Donald Sutherland and make it an adventure film, then you've got something really good. The movie is paced well, shot well and it looks great on Blu-Ray. Poor supplemental features, but I bought this for the movie so I'm not too bummed about the lack of extras. If you like adventure films and video games, you'll probably like this. I am a big fan of the video game series Uncharted, this movie reminds me of that series only not as funny or dangerous, but this movie is still witty and adventurous.

Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena is Sutherland's bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.

If you can imagine serious island-thrillers like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deep/dp/0767818067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deep</a>"" & the two ""Into the Blue"" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartooney action you'd have a good idea of ""Fool's Gold.""

Kate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the film is way too long at 112 minutes. A silly, fun film like this should never go over the 90 minute mark, meaning ""Fool's Gold"" is at least 22 minutes overlong.

The story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast of
Queensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean. Regardless, the film is worth watching just for the locations, especially on a cloudy Fall day or a cold Winter night.

3091900,3,B0012KJ0DK,"While this isn't by any means the turkey some have painted it as, this is far from a perfect movie.  Nonetheless, Mathew Mahogany and Kate Hugsome are  a charming enough pair with some convincing chemistry onscreen, in this treasure hunt caper.  They play a couple having just concluded a divorce, but who find themselves bound together once more to complete a treasure hunt, with the help of Donald Sutherland's ""rich-guy-with-nothing-better-to-do"" and his daughter.  What could possibly happen ...?
Well, while the plot point A leads to plot point B with ending `C' predictably reached, it's more the surrounding characters that threaten to sink the movie than the moderately engaging main characters or lazy plot.  Just as you might find a smile lightening your face thanks to either the stars efforts or the scenery, Donald Sutherland overeggs his English accented billionaire shtick, and his daughter is ditzy beyond reason (or humor) and the movie constantly walks a thin borderline between amusing caper and unpleasant farce.  And the bad guys?  Thoroughly unfunny goons for the most part, who fail to be funny, threatening, or even remotely interesting.  Even Ray Winstone looks like he was along just for the vacation.
On the other hand, the scenery (beyond Mathew's abs or Kate's curves, that is) is quite breathtaking.. you may well feel a subliminal urge to go on a diving vacation by the end of the movie.
Pretty and bland rather than brilliant or barnstorming, this is a fairly pain free movie to pass some time.. it never quite nails the right tone and is lacking in the actual laugh out loud humor stakes, but leave the brain in neutral, and don't expect to watch more than once, and it just about floats long enough to kill a couple of hours.",1305158400,,1759,4.898989898989899

3091902,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Had very low expectations going in and so that might explain, in part, why I had such a great time watching this fun predictable flick - a gentle mix of ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""The Deep"" with a wink toward ""Romancing The Stone"".

Had Warner Bros originally advertised this as a treasure hunt - I think it would've done much better at the box office, but I vividly remember seeing the ""love story"" pitch and that clearly turned off a significant portion of the (male) audience who might've paid to see it at the theaters. Too bad, since the love story aspect thankfully took a backseat to the action/adventure.

A pair of minor complaints. Unlike her mom, I've never found Kate Hudson either sexy or particularly funny. So that hampered the romantic aspects in my opinion. A case where the echo isn't as clear and crisp as the voice.

And this appears to be another walk-through role by Donald Sutherland, who seems to be doing a lot of paycheck appearances lately. Not too long ago I wasted some funds on what looked like a promising Anglo-Sino production. Rented entirely on his featured spot on the cover artwork for ""Big Shot's Funeral"", a flick where he was on screen for a grand total of two minutes - and not even a continuous two minutes.

I know that Matt would like a wider audience, but I don't see any real issue with him being this generation's Tom Selleck - handsome, funny, but not an actor known for great range. And there's nothing wrong with making a solid living, as Selleck has proven these past 40 years. He continues to perform well past what would've been career enders for so many his 'face' peers. Watch Hugh Jackman's nosediving career path to see what I mean.

The blowhole thing is real, or at least a version of the story of a real treasure that has been sought for quite some time.  I can't recall the details.  The ""professional"" treasure hunter is sort of a caricature of Mel Fisher....

While I am not an avid fan of McConaughey or Hudson for that matter, I really enjoyed both on them in `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' and was excited about them reteaming for this film.  When you couple that with the fact that Dennis Sutherland is a wonderful veteran actor, Ray Winstone is one of my favorite guilty pleasures and the whole premise reminded me of `Into the Blue', a film that I am not ashamed to admit totally loving (yes, I do occasionally shut my brain off and enjoy ridiculousness) you can see why I wanted to see this despite the poor reception given by critics.

I mean, this is obviously not a critic's darling.

Sadly, this movie fails on so many levels I can't even begin to understand why anyone would give this more than one solitary star (if it even deserves that, but you cannot review it without giving it a star placement).  I mean, the film is ridiculously stupid (especially that whole blowhole thing) and horribly acted and there is absolutely no real chemistry between the two leads (I'm serious, everything appears forced).

I can't find a redeeming factor anywhere.

The film tells the story of recently divorced Finn and Tess.  Finn is a slacker who owes a ton of money to a rapper and Tess is working for a millionaire and is easily distracted by her ex-husbands apparent charm.  First of all I want to point out that neither of these two stars has ever looked WORSE on screen than they do here.  McConaughey (who is rather unattractive when you take away his stomach anyway) looks like a washed up shipwreck survivor here, with some of the worst hair I've ever seen, and Hudson, who was once so stunning, is aging horribly and looks just hard, worn and overly tanned here.  The acting between them, especially on the part of Matthew, is just C-Grade movie mediocre.  They can't stumble through their lengthy treasure ogling speeches without sounding like they are reading off of a plaque board.

There is no naturalism here, at all.

So Finn finds remnants of this legendary treasure he and Tess have waited nearly forever to find and so he persuades her, and her boss, to embark on a treasure hunt.  They have competition in Finn's former employee, Moe, as well as rapper Biggbunny (he said it was one word).

When you strip chemistry and acting from a film this preposterous you are left with absolutely nothing to warrant its existence.

Alexis Dziena is just excruciating here, Ray Winstone's accent goes in and out in every scene (I still love you, but I have to be honest), Kevin Hart is just another stereotype and WHAT WAS UP WITH MALCOLM-JAMAL WARNER?!?!?!?

I don't think I can express enough hatred for this vile cinematic offering.  I wish that I had never seen it.  Wait, I wish that it had never been made so that I would never have been tricked into thinking that I could possible enjoy it.  It is that worthless.  I hate films that are worthless.  I mean, even bad films have SOMETHING to justify their existence.  These people don't even look pretty here.

3091924,2,B0012KJ0DK,"The appropriately titled ""Fool's Gold"" is a lame, thoroughly hopeless romantic comedy whose sole purpose for existence is to allow us to watch a couple of impossibly beautiful people (Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson) romping around in an impossibly beautiful setting (the Caribbean Sea).

McConaughey, in another of his increasingly frivolous roles (there was a time when he seemed to have an ambition to be an actual actor), plays a down-on-his-luck treasure salvager who believes he's uncovered the whereabouts of a vast fortune - the Queen of Spain's dowry to be exact - that was lost in a shipwreck off the coast of Florida in the early 1700s.  Hudson plays his longsuffering wife who fancies herself an intellectual and therefore has filed for divorce from a man who is all brawn and no brains and who is always off chasing rainbows when he should be at home with the woman he loves.

To say that ""Fool's Gold"" lands on the screen with a resounding thud would be to minimize its awfulness.  McConaughey and Hudson, both highly attractive performers under other circumstances, are here reduced to flailing around like mad and mugging for the camera just to cover up for the fact that there is not a single clever or witty line in a screenplay that takes a full one-hour-and-fifty-two minutes to play itself out - a screenplay, incidentally, in which every single black character is either a rap star, an armed-to-the-teeth cutthroat or both (the gays don`t fare much better, come to think of it, as they`re all portrayed as ninnies and cowards).  In supporting roles, Donald Sutherland and Malcolm-Jamal Warner also wind up getting trapped in the wreckage.

Unfortunately, for all those involved in ""Fool`s Gold,"" the boats aren't the only things sinking in this film.",1238284800,,1776,4.962962962962963

3091926,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Before film fans ream me a new one for rating FOOL'S GOLD as an adequate movie, let me explain why I did.

It was a loooong day at work. Really long. One of those days where your body feels like a freight train ran it over and your brain's a bowl of oatmeal. You've probably had those days. You just want to come home, unwind, sip a cool one, and sit back in a mindless haze for a while. Ahh!

Normally I like films that are bit more visceral and cerebral. But not this day. My mind needed the minimal amount of energy expended in order to ingest something, and Fool's Gold met that need.

Yes, we certainly get to see Matthew McConaughey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) without his shirt on more times than you can shake a stick at. And Kate Hudson looks mighty nice in those tight fitting clothes and bikini. The ease with which I fell into the story was exactly what I needed to end this rather rough day. And so it goes...

Benjamin Finnegan (McConaughey) is an underwater treasure hunter, but he's hit some rough waters. His wife Tess (Hudson) is divorcing him. His boat that's financed by a meanspirited, island-owning rapper has just sunk. And his partner Alfonz (Ewen Bremner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-at-a-Funeral/dp/B001O2MBP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death at a Funeral</a>) has no qualms about leaving him when things are tough. He's been searching nearly his entire life for something known as The Queen's Dowry, a fortune in treasure that sunk aboard a ship in 1715. While hunting for this treasure, though, Benjamin must battle financial woes, a wife who still loves him but can't stand his antics (so much so that she's divorcing him), and the dangers being associated with a rapper/murderer who simply wants the benjamins.

The outlandish nature of just about everything makes the entire production minimally cerebral at best. Examples are 300-year-old canons resting at the bottom of the ocean but we're still able to read what's written on them. Explosions that knock divers out of the water but don't harm them in any way. A bimbo richese daughter who knows nothing about ...well ...anything. And the list goes on.

But even so, I was in the mood for all of this nonsense. And if you've had a rough day and need something mindless, this one will certainly fit your needs. But if you're looking for anything approaching story depth, you might want to pass.",1235088000,,2548,5.18734793187348
3091927,1,B0012KJ0DK,"The cast was good, the topic (hunt for sunken treasure) is always fun, how bad can it be? Well, rent this out and find out for yourselves. Extremely cliche, *very* bad acting, zero chemistry between the cast, one big disappointment.",1234656000,,232,4.825

Disappointing more because it featured many famous actors and actresses and wasn't upto the expectations.",1234396800,3,552,4.924731182795699
3091929,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Having seen most of Matthew McConaughey's movies since I got married, I have to admit that this is probably is 2nd best movie after Contact.  The storyline is quite good and involved, with multiple threads flowing thru it.  First thread; Matthew's character, Finn, plays a shipwreck treasure hunter on the hunt for the Aurelia, a spanish ship carrying gold and other treasures between Spain and the New World.  Second thread; the treasure hunter's relationship with his estranged wife, played by Kate Hudson.  Third thread; the strained father-daughter relationship between Donald Sutherland's character and his spoiled daughter.  And the last thread is the 3-way race to find the sunken treasure.  The comedy is there, provided by all four threads, and the romance is not mushy.  Best of all, the ending of the story is not that predictable.",1234137600,2,842,5.147058823529412

3091931,5,B0012KJ0DK,"This is one of those movies that won't be a hit with the critics, but then again, it was never meant to be.  Instead, it is non-stop, light-hearted entertainment with delightful stars and a great way to spend a couple of hours.",1229126400,,227,4.404761904761905
3091932,2,B0012KJ0DK,"I know ""Fool's Gold"" is supposed to be mindless fun. The treasure-seeking story doesn't have to be believable as long as the film is fun to watch. I liked Matthew McConaughey's ""Sahara"" for what it was: good, clean fun of watching our hero doing what he is expected to do. I'm sorry to say this, but for me ""Fool's Gold"" turned out a disappointing entry from Matthew McConaughey who deserves a much better film.

Matthew McConaughey is a treasure hunter Finn, who is rather single-mindedly pursuing his dream - a Spanish ship loaded with gold, which has been lost for 300 years off the coast of Florida. Kate Hudson is his wife Tess, now divorcing him as she wants a new life in college. The story is all too familiar, but not bad. However, Andy Tennant, usually a competent director (whose CV includes ""Hitch"" and ""Ever After"") tells the story in an awfully slow and confusing way.

""Fool's Gold"" tries to be an action-adventure-comedy-romance, but it becomes none of them. There really isn't much thrilling action to speak of, let alone thrilling adventures. To make matters worse, there isn't much comedy or romance either. The film suffers contrived situations, confusing subplots and lack of style. The action/adventures become abruptly violent as characters get shot in the foot or harpooned in the thigh. Romance or love-hate relationship of Tess and Finn doesn't convince as they talk a lot about treasures and love, but either character (with their long, boring dialogues) doesn't really look serious about what he or she is talking about.

Both stars look great, it is true, and they are clearly having a good time. But Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, formerly seen together as the leads of a romantic comedy ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" does not have enough on-screen chemistry together to make us really care. Probably they are not to be blamed, but the weak script is, as it contains so many detracting factors. Stereotypical characters--Ewen Bremmer as British sidekick; Donald Sutherland as eccentric billionaire and Kevin Hart as murderous gangster (or rap star), etc--do not help, nor lack of coherent storyline that goes on and on, not knowing where to go. And as to the annoying, bikini-clad ""Gemma Honeycutt"" character, what can I say?

""Fool's Gold"" is a missed opportunity. It could have been more enjoyable like ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was fun with two likable leads (and their charisma as stars), beautiful locations and story full of adventures. ""Fool's Gold"" has all these things, but still fails to be entertaining, which is the greatest flaw.",1227225600,3,2583,4.944700460829493
3091933,1,B0012KJ0DK,I was very disappointed with this movie.  Did not care for it at all.  Tired old treasure hunt movie and the dialogue was very poor.,1226793600,5,132,4.24

Matthew McConaughey has charismatic charm that is appealing to the ladies and Kate Hudson has the seductive and witty magnetism much like her mother, although she is her own person.  Brilliant pair!

Wonderfully, energetic, comical and the story line address how humans interact as the opposite sex share a battle of the wits.  I so look forward to another entertaining romance comedy by Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson in the near future.",1224547200,3,681,6.715909090909091
3091935,3,B0012KJ0DK,This movie was good - but nothing exceptional - disappointed with movie - the first by these stars I thought was great and this was below my expectations.  Would watch once - but personally would not advise to buy it - just borrow or rent.,1224201600,,239,4.311111111111111
3091936,4,B0012KJ0DK,"This a film that defies criticism.  It wasn't made to win awards.  If memory serves this flick was released around Valentine's Day to cash in on those taking their sweeties or intended sweeties to something lighthearted and romantic.  ""There Will Be Blood"" just wouldn't cut it.  In a nutshell, this is cinematic cotton candy.  I saw this film about two days ago and it's pretty much escaped my memory banks.  As was intended.  This could be characterized as a screwball action-adventure comedy though it falls a little short of Grant-Dunne or Powell-Loy.  That said the teaming of Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson sets off kinetic sparks.  They project both intelligence and sexual heat that is palpable.  The presence of Donald Sutherland as a mega-millionaire is always inviting.  Sit back and enjoy the show and remain optimistic that McConaughey and Hudson will one day appear in a vehicle that has a little more meat to it.",1223856000,,932,4.948387096774193
3091937,2,B0012KJ0DK,"I'll admit it, I got into ""Failure To Launch"" and gave it 4 stars. This on the other hand is a new low for all involved, which basically means it's barrel scraps. It's labeled as a romantic comedy, yet their were no real romantic moments, and the majority of the comedy comes from two minor gay cooks. Sure, there are other redeemable elements, but they're few and far between. It's National Treasure at sea, except less exiting, less humorous, and more juvenile (Wow, that's pretty bad). First the bad elements.

With the exception of a few Kate Hudson (although I would've preferred another Sarah Jessica Parker outing) and the general rough jerk-persona of Matthew McConaughey, the acting is bad to pathetic. The villains being the worst offenders, with not even that Cosby kid showing one bit of prose. Ray Winstone is bad as always, along with the main villain, Bunny, and his white hired gun. And poor old Donald Sutherland gives possibly the WORST performance of the movie, and/or his career. Matt's sidekick doesn't add to anything either. The story is unoriginal, and obviously little to no thought went into this treasure tale, so I won't dwell on the plot. The action is also mostly uninteresting.

Good elements? Well, Donald Sutherland's screen daughter does well as a stupid and ditsy Paris Hilton like character. There is some good humor involved, again mostly coming from two minor gay guys, and a few of Hudson's comments.

Amazingly, it could've been much worse, but not by much. Being from the director of ""Hitch,"" you'd expect something a bit more quality, but this movie has more holes than Hugh Hefner's water bed. This movie all but fails in what it set out to do, and I wouldn't even recommend this for renting. There's plenty of better date movies out there, so just say ""NO!"" to this movie, and move along. Not much to see here.

Real Score: 1.5",1223683200,,1871,4.765432098765432
3091938,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Here I thought this was going to be a cheesy chick-flick romance, but that's not all I got.  If I had to sum it up, I'd call it National Treasure at sea.  There was romance, of course, since the premise of the movie revolves around the hero and heroine and their failed marriage.  But most of the plot and action are not about that at all, and it focuses heavily on the search for the buried (sunken) treasure.

To add to it, there's a lot of action (and violence) combined with comedy reminiscent of Bad Boys.  People being flippant in serious situations and that sort of thing.  The characters are an interesting mix that add to the story, and while the ending is a little predictable, getting there is all the fun.

I very much enjoyed this movie even though I went into it with low expectations.  I say throw out your preconceived notions based on the promos and give it a try (if you like the National Treasure/Bad Boy type movies, of course).",1223424000,,948,4.408045977011494

If you do make your boyfriend watch this pointless movie, you totally owe them a guys' night just to get it out of their heads.",1222041600,2,427,4.35
3091941,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Spending life as a beachbum appeals to Finn (McConaughey).  So much so, in fact, that it cost him his wife Tess (Kate Hudson).  She was happy to be with him for some time, chasing his dreams of finding sunken Spanish treasure, but inevitably he never managed to find gold or strike it rich.  On the day of their wedding annulment, Finn finds a clue that may lead him to the riches that could make him famous and filthy rich, not to mention rekindling his marriage.

Once he links back up with Tess, the two go through relationship struggles, quirky scenarios, and with the help of a rich financier (Sutherland) and his dim-witted daughter Gemma (Dziena), they seek to find their treasures.  Facing an unscrupulous and criminal opponent nicknamed Bigg Bunny (Hart) - as well as his mischievous and sometimes bumbling crew - the dangerous race is on for the treasure.

Even though this is a complete rip-off of Into the Blue, and Kate Hudson is nowhere near Jessica Alba, it's a decent date movie nonetheless.  Whereas Into the Blue took the drama/suspense angle, Fool's Gold goes the romantic dramedy route.  With a few good laughs, a not-so-deep plot (and an appropriate title), the next move is constantly predictable, and it never really has a chance of being hilarious or memorable in any specific way.  Perhaps if the cocaine addicted sharks from Into the Blue were used, and Hudson was replaced with Alba, then this would be more highly regarded.  Otherwise, it's just two pretty people with average chemistry, in an idiotic yet likeable date movie.

In the end it's like deep-sea fishing and coming up with a license plate.  You're happy that something was hooked, but it's ultimately pointless.",1221955200,,1701,4.8477508650519034
3091942,5,B0012KJ0DK,"Question.  What's wrong with this movie?
Answer.  Nothing. Nothing other than it didn't contain graphic sex, the dismemberment of human bodies, or the ""F"" word every 5 seconds and it was a PG-13 rating. Granted it's not Oscar material but if ""No Country for Old Men"" can win big then who knows... This was a refreshing movie which shows that there is still some talent left in Hollywood that has the ability to write a good story and act. More movies need to be made in this manner. Give me more light hearted comedy mixed with romance, adventure, and some action.  Something I can sit down with my wife and kids to watch without having to worry about the Hollywood sewer line being emptied into their heads.
I think that there is a conspiracy in Hollywood to ruin movies like this with bad reviews and discouraging comment. Take the movie ""Sahara"" for example. This was a funny movie which was harpooned like a humpbacked whale by the critics. Once again this was not Oscar material but it was a good flick which entertained without dumbing down the audience or falling back on sex, drugs and bad language to fill out a poor script.
To those who panned ""Fools Gold"" I think you need to step down off the high horse. If you can't enjoy a simple well told story like ""Fools Gold"" for what it is and the talent the cast brings to the movie than there is indeed no hope for Hollywood.",1221523200,4,1381,4.450592885375494
3091943,2,B0012KJ0DK,"The one thing that annoys the viewer time and again in this movie is the lengthy dialogues and scenes (really badly overtimed), particularly involving Mathew and Kate and their co-stars. Scenes that are supposed to be funny turn out to be tiring and exasperating to watch instead. The scene where Kate throws the dining plates at her hosts after going into shock while meeting her ex was too much and really not funny. Although the movie tries to nail the character Gemma as the dumb one most of the other cast make a wonderful fool of themselves instead with those tiring long scenes. In fact the character Gemma offered some respite.

Full points for the camera work as the beaches look beautiful with the lovely blue waters. The legend, Bob Marley's immortal ""Could you be loved"" is heard again, probably the song most used in movie soundtracks.

But in the spirit of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, it's a spunky contrived, predictable mystery. No, the characters were not all complex, but at least the powers that be went to the trouble of making them entertaining and personable.

I liked the idea of looking for sunken treasure. I liked the upbeat island soundtrack. I liked the funny characters. I liked the pretty scenes and the silly lines. I liked the random explosions and fight scenes, as pleasantly ridiculous as they were.

However, if you are  a) Looking for a fun film to kill ~2 hours, or b) an avid Kate Hudson fan, then this film won't dissapoint you that much.  Although their performances could have been better (such as in How to Lose a Guy), which might be attributed to a somewhat lacking script - Kate and Mat still manage to deliver that same chemistry they seem to exude with each other.

Now, the transfer itself - I found it to be pretty good overall.  Some of the ocean scenes look absolutely beautiful in BD, the sound is solid, and the transfer is pretty clean (no spots, not a lot of grain).  If anything, maybe the colors are a bit too saturated in some places, but in a film of this type, it works for it, rather than against it.

More of ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" as there is plenty of comedy along with the action, but some of the diving scenes and treasure history are reminiscent of ""The Deep"". Lots of romance and action that the most family should enjoy. Not for the little ones. When a man finds proof of a treasure in the ocean he has searched for years in all the wrong places, some criminals become very interested. The fact he accidentally bumps into his ex-wife only makes it more interesting since she is fluent in the study of treasures. There is a good chemistry here and plenty of action and laughs. If you enjoy McConaughey and/or Hudson you will probably want to at least rent it. My wife and I thought the trailers looked interesting enough that I went ahead and bought it. We enjoyed it thoroughly and I am glad I got it. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

Even as a rental, this one is a bit weak and something that could just as easily be passed over for something else.

This movie wanders territory between the 2 and 3 star range, and if possible, I'd plant it around 2.5 for the whole product.  The Blu-ray is relatively light on extras, but that may be more a matter of the studios showing us some mercy.  The gag reel that is included isn't all that funny and really doesn't show us much to keep us interested.

The movie was fun and quite an adventure, but I would have liked to have seen more of the on screen romance on screen and not hidden behind books or tables or whatever.

I have to add that I do love Mr. McConaughey to pieces, but there is just something about his accent that makes all his characters seem like the same guy in different movies.

This movie, although not the deepest plot in history, is a great, fun movie to watch, especially with a significant other. It's a great adventure flick with plenty of laughs for everyone. The scenery makes you want to go to Key West, and the special effects are getting better and better.

Finn is a die-hard treasure hunter who loves the Florida history and the mysteries that the ocean holds. He's carefree, walks around barefoot, and is totally, completely broke. His soon-to-be-ex-wife Tess, is down to earth, smart, hardworking, yet still has a side that is just as carefree and fun-loving as Finn.

Finn borrows money from a dangerous rapper to finance fixes on his boat in order to search for a 300-year-lost treasure at the bottom of the bay. Instead, Finn accidentally sinks his boat and suddenly owes a lot of money to a dangerous man. Tess is divorcing him because he is irresponsible and broke, and then circumstances throw them together with an unlikely crowd: A millionaire and his daughter (Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena), the Ukraine (Ewen Bremner), and a couple of odd cooks on the millionaire's yacht.

Some time through the movie, they have a revelation that they've been searching in the wrong place and one clue after another finally leads them to one of the greatest treasures in history.

They both spend most of this film wet and half-naked, never a bad thing. A good supporting role is played by Donald Sutherland, who plays the multibillionaire grubstaking the adventure.

Of course, Finn and Tess drive each other crazy as newly-divorced but continuing business partners. The barbed affection between them provides most of the energy of FOOL'S GOLD. There are bad guys also searching for the treasure, so there's some action mixed in with the adventure.

Tess Finnegan (Kate Hudson) has had enough.  She's taken a job aboard millionaire Nigel Honeycutt's (Donald Sutherland) yacht.  And she's divorcing Finn.

Finn's latest quest is the Queen's Dowry, a treasure lost almost 300 years ago.  In fact, he's found a piece of it.  Now all he needs is financial backing.  His irresponsibility has left his last backer rather mad at him.  So he decides to get Nigel's help, completely unaware that Nigel is Tess's new boss.

Unfortunately, the shipwreck is somewhere around the island owned by dangerous rapper Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart).  As in Finn's last investor.  Can they find the treasure without Bigg getting his hands on it?  Can Finn win Tess back in the process?

Let's be honest, this is mindless, predictable entertainment.  Especially since the previews gave away many of the key scenes.  But it is fun.

It's trying to be a action comedy.  It had some laughs, but there weren't as many as I had hoped.  The funniest scenes involved Nigel's daughter Gemma as played by Alexis Dziena.  Anytime she was on screen, I was guaranteed a laugh.  Most of the action in the film was played for laughs as well, and is over the top.  Then again, what action movie isn't over the top?  Even the exposition scene near the beginning that is key to understanding how Tess and Finn got started on this trail wasn't that great.  I couldn't follow it, and I tried.

So why did I like it?  Because of the characters.  I really did care for all of them.  Well, the good guys anyway.  Credit for this obviously goes to the actors who are obviously having so much fun making the film.  Frankly, they made it hard for me not to like it.

It's a predictable mystery movie rather than being a completely romantic comedy and you really felt as if you were the ones on a treasure hunt.

1. Matthew McConaughey goes shirtless
2. Kate Hudson channels her mom
3. He's irresponsible
4. She's determined
5. They're divorced
6. They're going treasure hunting
7. You can guess the ending before watching the opening credits

In other words, there's nothing new about this light and ditzy treasure hunting romp that plays heavily on stereotyping and McConaughey's shirtless bod.

The legend behind the treasure is interesting enough. Forty chests of gold and jewels, destined to be a dowry fit for an eighteenth century queen, was lost without a trace during the hurricane season of 1715.  Finn (McConaughey) and Tess (Hudson) had been searching for it for years, until an accidental discovery clues them in that they're finally on the right track.

With the exception of Donald Sutherland, the movie loses momentum whenever the supporting actors are on-screen and the burden of the caricaturized characters sink the movie even deeper than the plotline.

The action scenes were good, especially at the end, and although there is violence, most of it is off camera.  A couple of swear words and a few naughty scenes make for a PG-13 movie that should be found guilty of breach of promise.

3325880,5,B0012KJ0DK,If you like How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days you'll love this movie. A bit slow at one point but it picked back up. My husband and I laughed at the silly comedy in the movie. It was fun seeing two people and how different they were at times but the relationship still works. Great Flick.,1211932800,4,284,3.913793103448276
3325881,1,B0012KJ0DK,"I swear I cannot recall a more boring ""adventure"" movie in my whole life. In spite of the ""cool"" actors, the tropical set, the intrigues about pirates and treasures the movie is ""the"" perfect sleeping pill. There is not a single exciting, adventurous or romantic minute in the whole length of it. It makes one feel uncomfortable to see Donald Sutherland trying to navigate this rubbish nonsense. Unless you really desperately need a cure for imsomnia, avoid it at all costs.",1210377600,4,474,4.864197530864198
3325882,4,B0012KJ0DK,"I saw this movie on my first date with some dude. I saw the movie and it was cute and not as predictable as most are and not sappy. Anywho, It depends what fits your fancy but this was a okay film for me and my date to watch. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the ending since his wife called me saying I was dating her husband and he was cheating on her with me. Talk about a way to end a date, A black eye and a car keyed. *his not mine* Kinda makes me feel like what Kate Hudson felt everytime she was betrayed. Anywho, I cant wait for the dvd to come out so I can watch it with BETTER company. I always thought Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson make a cute couple XD",1210291200,2,664,3.925925925925926
3325883,5,B0012KJ0DK,"If you love Matthew Mc Conaughey and Kate Hudson, this film is irresistible!!!Only these two could have pulled off these roles. Their chemistry is off-the-charts and they make the plot fun.

The film is set in beautiful tropical locales as Kate and Matthew pursue lost treasure and----each other. They even reuse a prominent line from ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". It's too cute...

This movie is not meant to be serious in any way. You can't bring yourself to be afraid of the villain---a ficticious rapper named Bigg Bunny. He lends comic relief. It has to be said that Sutherland was great in his role as well.

If you are expecting a super-suspenseful action movie, you won't like this. But if you have a sense of humor and enjoy great scenery and these two actors, get yourself some Fool's Gold. :0)",1210291200,5,806,4.583333333333333

3325911,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Benjamin Finnegan (Matthew McConaughey) in search a ship wreck with gold and other treasure alienates his wife Tess (Kate Hudson,) defaults on a loan from the local bad guy Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart) and misplaces a boat.

Yet he finds a clue to the treasure and must placate Bigg Bunny, regain the appreciation of his wife, find a sugar daddy to finance his expedition and beat a rival to the claim. The sugar daddy turns out to be Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland). Nigel is on his own quest to regain if he ever had it the affection of his flibbertigibbet daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena.)

Who will find the treasure (if there really is one)?
Will love or at least lust reappear to our forlorn treasure hunting couple?
Will daddy ever get the respect of this daughter?
Will we get board watching this formula movie that tries too hard?

I watched the Blu-ray version and even though it could not save the movie, they did a terrific job on the seascape and other visuals.",1511654400,4,971,4.601156069364162

3325913,4,B0012KJ0DK,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Many funny scenes, physical, situational, and verbal. I'd regard it in similar terms with McConnahey's other treasure movie, Sahara.

I had the advantage of liking the ocean, diving, and movies about treasure hunting. If you do too, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.

The acting is solid throughout, the scenery is gorgeous, and the steps to solving the treasure mystery are both captivating and not nearly as 'out there' as in some other treasure hunting movies.

You might have to forgive a couple of diving gaffes (being near an underwater explosion, even small, is pretty much going to kill you or at least ruin your hearing, but most adventure movies have a few factual errors like that. If you held them all accountable for them you'd never watch another one.",1508976000,5,808,4.875912408759124

3325947,3,B0012KJ0DK,This is a good movie that can be watched over and over.  Matthew McConaughey plays kind of a laid back guy who just wants to do his own thing and be left alone.  Kat Hudson plays his wife who wants a divorce.  He's a treasure hunter who thinks he's own to something big.  Alexis Dziena who I didn't know who she was until this.  Looks like she's about 14 but knows the power she has over guys.  And Donald Sutherland plays her rich Father.  I don't remember which movie came out first.  But this came out about the same time as Into The Blue.  And is it just me.  Or does there seem like there is a rivalry between Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba and their bikini's.,1490313600,,663,4.149606299212598

Having been to Key West I was looking forward to seeing some familiar locations and reminiscing over a lovely vacation, but was disappointed when I didn't recognize anything. This is because the movie was filmed in Australia due to hurricane season. But wow the locations are beautiful!  If you have been to Key West and are familiar with Mel Fisher a lot of things will seem familiar.  The character Moe Fitch is loosely based on him. Kevin Hart's character is a little annoying (who could ever take him seriously as a gangster?) but overall this movie is pretty fun.",1439251200,,738,4.825396825396825

In this romantic comedy,the find together playing a divorced couple who rekindle their marriage while searching for a lost treasure. Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena co-star. Andy Tennant directs.

Well,there is nothing really to say about this movie as it fails on every level. The characters are developed that we simply don't care about them particularly Benjamin and Tess. The audience probably do not care whether they get back together or not. Also,we don't care as well whether they find the treasure or not. We know what's going to happen in the end as it was predictable from beginning to end. Definitely,one may find it too long. What's worse,there isn't any funny moment in it as the gags were practically humorless. Finally,there is nothing really good going for the film except the charm and appeal of McConaughey and Hudson. If you find their first film together bad,you'll probably find this worse.",1433721600,,1055,4.96045197740113

3326206,5,B0012KJ0DK,"FOOL'S GOLD [2008] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] True Love Takes A Dive!

Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson go for the gold, the diamonds, emeralds and rubies. As a just-divorced couple who bicker and banter their way through an adventure and laugh-packed undersea treasure hunt. Mathew McConaughey is Finn, in love with his ex [Kate Hudson] and in deep with gangster Bigg Bunny. After eight years of searching, Finn gets a clue to the whereabouts of the Queen's Dowry, a fabulous fortune that mysteriously disappeared in the Caribbean in 1715. Now all he has to do is get the gold, get the girl and get going before Bigg Bunny gets him. Directed by Andy Tennant's Fool's Gold' glitters with danger, action, romance, comedy, great one-liners and a great time to be had by all!

FILM FACT: Warner Bros. and director Andy Tennant planned to shoot the film in the Caribbean, but decided on Queensland, Australia because the hurricane season in the Caribbean was likely to stall production of the film. The Key West scenes were filmed in Port Douglas.[citation needed] Filming also took place in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Lizard Island, Airlie Beach, and Hervey Bay. Scenes were also filmed at Batt Reef, where Steve Irwin died from a stingray barb in 2006. Inside scenes were shot on a sound stage at the Warner Bros studio facility and the actors and crew stayed in luxury homes and apartments on the Gold Coast. McConaughey mentioned having a python in the backyard of his house in Port Douglas. Matthew McConaughey said, ""There were other days like the day we went out diving and swam with a dugong, which was very cool. Two crew members were stung by Irukandji jellyfish during filming, so some of the water scenes were shot in the Caribbean because the actors were so frightened. At the time of filming, The Precious Gem luxury motor yacht in the film was called the Keri Lee and has subsequently been renamed ""Penny Mae"". It was designed by yacht architect Ward Setzer of Setzer Design Group and originally named Status Quo.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: About Five years ago, Hollywood paired Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and the match rewarded the filmmakers with box office receipts exceeding $100 million. No doubt the hope was that a reunion of these two in a script intended to recall Romancing the Stone would reap similar benefits. Now the actors are reunited in this rom-com film Fool's Gold and do not have such a negative attitude like most of the critics who slated this film, I on the other hand love it.

The film follows Ben Finnegan [Mathew McConaughey], better known to his friends as 'Finn,' a rascal of a treasure hunter who is obsessed with finding the wreck of an old Spanish boat off of the coast of southern Florida. When the boat he was loaned from a gangster named Bigg Bunny [Kevin Hart] sinks, he finds himself on the receiving end of some nastiness from a pair of dreadlocked hit-men, one of whom is Malcolm Jamal Warner from The Cosby Show. He escapes from them just in time to make it to the courthouse where his wife, Tess [Kate Hudson] has divorced him. They begrudgingly decide to go their separate ways and be done with it, but you just know that isn't going to last.

When, seemingly by fate, Fin finds himself saved by the boat of a wealthy man named Nigel Honeycutt [Donald Sutherland] and his daughter Gemma Honeycutt [Alexis Dziena], he's surprised to find Tess working on board. Of course, Finn convinces everyone to join him on his treasure hunt and they all rush to find the loot before a competing group of treasure hunters or the aforementioned gangsters can beat them to it.

Donald Sutherland is mildly amusing in his supporting role as the wealthy yacht owner and Alexis Dziena is at least fun to look at but really, not a single actor or actress in this film delivers anything even close to a memorable performance. At 112 minutes in length to a lots of critics they felt the film was far too long for its own good, well I loved it all the way to the very end and watching the film gave you chance to get to know the foibles of all the characters.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Fool's Gold' is brought to you on Blu-ray in a stunning awesome 1080p encode image, plus a really brilliant 2.40.1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The image quality is a bit of a mixed bag here. Most of the film takes place on or around the ocean and so there's a lot of blue on the screen at all times. There are some nice lush locations used and the colours really should pop off the screen - and they do... a little too much. The blues are a bit overdone as are some of the yellows and oranges and the picture winds up looking kind of fake. Flesh tones look a bit waxy in spots and darker levels loose some fine shadow detail. Now, this is probably the look that the filmmakers were going for - the film really does feel sun-drenched and tropical for much of its run time. There are parts of the movie that look nice and clean and sharp and natural.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Standard definition 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound options are provided in English, French and Spanish with optional subtitles available in the same three languages. While there aren't any problems with this perfectly acceptable standard DVD mix, it would have been nice to see Warner Bros. take advantage of the possibilities that Blu-ray offers. Surrounds are well used and dialogue stays clean and clear from start to finish. There aren't any problems with hiss or distortion and everything is well balanced. That said, it doesn't provide the same level of depth that a good 5.1 Dolby TrueHD or 5.1 DTS-HD mix does and because of that it's a bit of a disappointment in that regard. The audio here is fine but it really should have and could have been much better.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2008] [480i] [2:16] This is little more than a couple of minutes of goofy flubs from the cast and we get a brief documentary entitled

Special Feature: Fool's Gold: Flirting With Disaster [2008] [480i] [3:54] Which looks at the chemistry and working relationship shared between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. This is pretty superficial stuff and it lends exactly zero insight into the making of the film despite input from the two stars as well as Donald Sutherland and director Andy Tennant. Both of these documentaries are presented in standard definition.

Finally, `Fool's Gold' cinematography is pretty breath-taking. An early scene with Finn's burning boat... then the sinking of the boat... is very well staged well and is probably the funniest moment in the film. The score is fun and in keeping with the tone of the film. There are definitely some effects and scope that announces there's money behind this production, but it doesn't do anything to elevate it's enjoy ability. Australia was used to sub for the Bahamas and that has jaw dropping crystal clear water landscape is used to great effect, but it looks pretty damn good. After reading countless crass critics lambasting's this production, it adds itself in this reviewer's mind - to a number of films that are savaged unnecessarily. No, it's not a masterpiece, but is that the benchmark we critics are expecting for a film to be enjoyable? I hope not, I wonder what they're all expecting from this film. I originally saw Matthew McConaughey's stunning film `SAHARA', which I also really loved and I understand this film is a companion to it, well as I say I loved this film and again I don't know why so many critics are so negative towards this film, as it is just a massive gigantic ""rom-com"" film with beautiful lush exotic landscapes and I personally think the other pompous critics are totally wrong about this film and to me I am honoured to have this brilliant funny 112 minute film in my Blu-ray Collection and I will not have any negative comments said about this film. Highly Recommended!

3326243,5,B0012KJ0DK,"Sure, Kate Hudson is cute in her own kind of way, but the 'real' acting that went on was with the characters portrayed and dynamics of both Matthew Mcconaughey and by Alexis Dziena (YUM!)...

The movie featured a great storyline, mystery, intrigue, emotion, playful banter, and a bit of adventure as everyone is out trying to find a sunken ship.

But let's be clear. This movie is carried by fantastic and amazing scenery, on a beautiful yacht, and combine that with the sex appeal of two gorgeous actresses and Donald' Pleasance's contribution...

I cannot give this romance comedy more recommendations. It's such a fun and lighthearted tale of the complexities of love and the interference simply living your life by your passions can throw your way.

And Alexis.... Broken Flowers for 'more' of her ;-)",1401840000,,805,4.940740740740741

Kate Hudson is an excellent actress and excels in whatever role she plays.

There's not enough tension for this to succeed as an action/adventure film, not enough humor for it to work as a comedy, and the romance fails in two respect. First, the violence and gore from the ""action/adventure"" parts of the script make the romance seem creepy.

3326352,4,B0012KJ0DK,"""Fool's Gold"" is great! This is how the story goes: Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan is a good-natured, surf bum-turned-treasure hunter who is obsessed with finding the legendary 18th century Queen's Dowry--40 chests of exotic treasure that was lost at sea in 1715. In his quest, Finn has sunk everything he has, including his marriage to Tess Finnegan and his more-rusty-than-trusty salvage boat, ""Booty Calls."" Just as Tess has begun to rebuild her life, working aboard a mega-yacht owned by billionaire Nigel Honeycutt, Finn discovers a vital clue to the treasure's whereabouts. Certain that his luck will change with the newfound information, Finn maneuvers himself aboard Nigel's yacht and, using his good-natured charm, convinces the tycoon and his Blackberry-wielding, celebutante daughter, Gemma, to join him in the pursuit of the Spanish treasure. Against Tess' better judgment, the search rekindles her love... of discovery. But they are not the only ones after the treasure. Finn's mentor-turned-nemesis Moe Fitch has also set out to claim the prize. The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Finn) and Kate Hudson (as Tess), both who also starred in ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" (2003) is great! The directing by Andy Tennant (who also directed ""Hitch"" (2005) & ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (2002) is great! The story by John Clafin & Daniel Zelman is great! The screenplay by Clafin, Zelman, & Tennant is great! The music by George Fenton (who also did the music to ""Hitch"" & ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to ""Enchanted"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Troy Takaki & Tracey Wadmore-Smith (both who also did the film editing to ""Hitch"" & ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is great! The casting by Juel Bestrop & Seth Yanklewitz (both who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Drillbit Taylor"" (2008) is great! The production design by Charles Wood (who also did the production design to ""Amazing Grace"" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Damien Drew (who also did the art direction to ""Superman Returns"" (2006) is excellent! The costume design by Ngila Dickson (who also did the costume design to ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) and won the Oscar for her work on ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" (2003) is excellent!

3326381,5,B0012KJ0DK,"Ok, so this isn't some sort of cinematic art or big special effects extravaganza. Why people are reviewing this negatively because of the two stars, makes no sense to me. Since when do people expect much from Matthew McConaughey or Kate Hudson? Kate was really good in Almost Famous, but other than that I haven't been blown away by her or Matthew for that matter, in fact, I can't even think of him ever not playing some dolt without his accent. This movie harkens back to something like Overboard with its chemistry of two stars who would seem like an odd pair from different walks of life. While Matthew is no Kurt Russell, I think Kate is better than her mother ever was. So these two have pretty good chemistry together and then you shoot this movie in the best parts of Australia with great actors like Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart and Donald Sutherland and make it an adventure film, then you've got something really good. The movie is paced well, shot well and it looks great on Blu-Ray. Poor supplemental features, but I bought this for the movie so I'm not too bummed about the lack of extras. If you like adventure films and video games, you'll probably like this. I am a big fan of the video game series Uncharted, this movie reminds me of that series only not as funny or dangerous, but this movie is still witty and adventurous. I like this movie a lot, get It on sale and then if you don't like it, you won't feel like you got ripped off.",1348531200,23,1452,4.401486988847584

You can see the ending a mile away and this film is just too long and pointless. Even Donald Sutherland looks bored and out of place here!

3326393,3,B0012KJ0DK,"2008's ""Fool's Gold"" stars Matthew McConaughey & Kate Hudson as a breaking-up couple in the Bahamas, the former a treasure-seeker. Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena is Sutherland's bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.

If you can imagine serious island-thrillers like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deep/dp/0767818067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deep</a>"" & the two ""Into the Blue"" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartooney action you'd have a good idea of ""Fool's Gold.""

Kate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the film is way too long at 112 minutes. A silly, fun film like this should never go over the 90 minute mark, meaning ""Fool's Gold"" is at least 22 minutes overlong.

The story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast of
Queensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean. Regardless, the film is worth watching just for the locations, especially on a cloudy Fall day or a cold Winter night.

Nonetheless, Mathew Mahogany and Kate Hugsome are  a charming enough pair with some convincing chemistry onscreen, in this treasure hunt caper.  They play a couple having just concluded a divorce, but who find themselves bound together once more to complete a treasure hunt, with the help of Donald Sutherland's ""rich-guy-with-nothing-better-to-do"" and his daughter.  What could possibly happen ...?
Well, while the plot point A leads to plot point B with ending `C' predictably reached, it's more the surrounding characters that threaten to sink the movie than the moderately engaging main characters or lazy plot.  Just as you might find a smile lightening your face thanks to either the stars efforts or the scenery, Donald Sutherland overeggs his English accented billionaire shtick, and his daughter is ditzy beyond reason (or humor) and the movie constantly walks a thin borderline between amusing caper and unpleasant farce.  And the bad guys?  Thoroughly unfunny goons for the most part, who fail to be funny, threatening, or even remotely interesting.  Even Ray Winstone looks like he was along just for the vacation.
On the other hand, the scenery (beyond Mathew's abs or Kate's curves, that is) is quite breathtaking.. you may well feel a subliminal urge to go on a diving vacation by the end of the movie.
Pretty and bland rather than brilliant or barnstorming, this is a fairly pain free movie to pass some time.. it never quite nails the right tone and is lacking in the actual laugh out loud humor stakes, but leave the brain in neutral, and don't expect to watch more than once, and it just about floats long enough to kill a couple of hours.",1305158400,,1759,4.898989898989899

3326399,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Had very low expectations going in and so that might explain, in part, why I had such a great time watching this fun predictable flick - a gentle mix of ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""The Deep"" with a wink toward ""Romancing The Stone"".

Had Warner Bros originally advertised this as a treasure hunt - I think it would've done much better at the box office, but I vividly remember seeing the ""love story"" pitch and that clearly turned off a significant portion of the (male) audience who might've paid to see it at the theaters. Too bad, since the love story aspect thankfully took a backseat to the action/adventure.

A pair of minor complaints. Unlike her mom, I've never found Kate Hudson either sexy or particularly funny. So that hampered the romantic aspects in my opinion. A case where the echo isn't as clear and crisp as the voice.

And this appears to be another walk-through role by Donald Sutherland, who seems to be doing a lot of paycheck appearances lately. Not too long ago I wasted some funds on what looked like a promising Anglo-Sino production. Rented entirely on his featured spot on the cover artwork for ""Big Shot's Funeral"", a flick where he was on screen for a grand total of two minutes - and not even a continuous two minutes.

I know that Matt would like a wider audience, but I don't see any real issue with him being this generation's Tom Selleck - handsome, funny, but not an actor known for great range. And there's nothing wrong with making a solid living, as Selleck has proven these past 40 years. He continues to perform well past what would've been career enders for so many his 'face' peers. Watch Hugh Jackman's nosediving career path to see what I mean.

The blowhole thing is real, or at least a version of the story of a real treasure that has been sought for quite some time.  I can't recall the details.  The ""professional"" treasure hunter is sort of a caricature of Mel Fisher....

3326408,1,B0012KJ0DK,"The horrible reviews made me well aware walking into this that it was going to be pretty bad.  Still, I had hope.  While I am not an avid fan of McConaughey or Hudson for that matter, I really enjoyed both on them in `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' and was excited about them reteaming for this film.  When you couple that with the fact that Dennis Sutherland is a wonderful veteran actor, Ray Winstone is one of my favorite guilty pleasures and the whole premise reminded me of `Into the Blue', a film that I am not ashamed to admit totally loving (yes, I do occasionally shut my brain off and enjoy ridiculousness) you can see why I wanted to see this despite the poor reception given by critics.

I mean, this is obviously not a critic's darling.

Sadly, this movie fails on so many levels I can't even begin to understand why anyone would give this more than one solitary star (if it even deserves that, but you cannot review it without giving it a star placement).  I mean, the film is ridiculously stupid (especially that whole blowhole thing) and horribly acted and there is absolutely no real chemistry between the two leads (I'm serious, everything appears forced).

I can't find a redeeming factor anywhere.

The film tells the story of recently divorced Finn and Tess.  Finn is a slacker who owes a ton of money to a rapper and Tess is working for a millionaire and is easily distracted by her ex-husbands apparent charm.  First of all I want to point out that neither of these two stars has ever looked WORSE on screen than they do here.  McConaughey (who is rather unattractive when you take away his stomach anyway) looks like a washed up shipwreck survivor here, with some of the worst hair I've ever seen, and Hudson, who was once so stunning, is aging horribly and looks just hard, worn and overly tanned here.  The acting between them, especially on the part of Matthew, is just C-Grade movie mediocre.  They can't stumble through their lengthy treasure ogling speeches without sounding like they are reading off of a plaque board.

There is no naturalism here, at all.

So Finn finds remnants of this legendary treasure he and Tess have waited nearly forever to find and so he persuades her, and her boss, to embark on a treasure hunt.  They have competition in Finn's former employee, Moe, as well as rapper Biggbunny (he said it was one word).

When you strip chemistry and acting from a film this preposterous you are left with absolutely nothing to warrant its existence.

Alexis Dziena is just excruciating here, Ray Winstone's accent goes in and out in every scene (I still love you, but I have to be honest), Kevin Hart is just another stereotype and WHAT WAS UP WITH MALCOLM-JAMAL WARNER?!?!?!?

I don't think I can express enough hatred for this vile cinematic offering.  I wish that I had never seen it.  Wait, I wish that it had never been made so that I would never have been tricked into thinking that I could possible enjoy it.  It is that worthless.  I hate films that are worthless.  I mean, even bad films have SOMETHING to justify their existence.  These people don't even look pretty here.

3326421,2,B0012KJ0DK,"The appropriately titled ""Fool's Gold"" is a lame, thoroughly hopeless romantic comedy whose sole purpose for existence is to allow us to watch a couple of impossibly beautiful people (Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson) romping around in an impossibly beautiful setting (the Caribbean Sea).

McConaughey, in another of his increasingly frivolous roles (there was a time when he seemed to have an ambition to be an actual actor), plays a down-on-his-luck treasure salvager who believes he's uncovered the whereabouts of a vast fortune - the Queen of Spain's dowry to be exact - that was lost in a shipwreck off the coast of Florida in the early 1700s.  Hudson plays his longsuffering wife who fancies herself an intellectual and therefore has filed for divorce from a man who is all brawn and no brains and who is always off chasing rainbows when he should be at home with the woman he loves.

To say that ""Fool's Gold"" lands on the screen with a resounding thud would be to minimize its awfulness.  McConaughey and Hudson, both highly attractive performers under other circumstances, are here reduced to flailing around like mad and mugging for the camera just to cover up for the fact that there is not a single clever or witty line in a screenplay that takes a full one-hour-and-fifty-two minutes to play itself out - a screenplay, incidentally, in which every single black character is either a rap star, an armed-to-the-teeth cutthroat or both (the gays don`t fare much better, come to think of it, as they`re all portrayed as ninnies and cowards).

3326423,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Before film fans ream me a new one for rating FOOL'S GOLD as an adequate movie, let me explain why I did.

It was a loooong day at work. Really long. One of those days where your body feels like a freight train ran it over and your brain's a bowl of oatmeal. You've probably had those days. You just want to come home, unwind, sip a cool one, and sit back in a mindless haze for a while. Ahh!

Normally I like films that are bit more visceral and cerebral. But not this day. My mind needed the minimal amount of energy expended in order to ingest something, and Fool's Gold met that need.

Yes, we certainly get to see Matthew McConaughey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) without his shirt on more times than you can shake a stick at. And Kate Hudson looks mighty nice in those tight fitting clothes and bikini. The ease with which I fell into the story was exactly what I needed to end this rather rough day. And so it goes...

Benjamin Finnegan (McConaughey) is an underwater treasure hunter, but he's hit some rough waters. His wife Tess (Hudson) is divorcing him. His boat that's financed by a meanspirited, island-owning rapper has just sunk. And his partner Alfonz (Ewen Bremner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-at-a-Funeral/dp/B001O2MBP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death at a Funeral</a>) has no qualms about leaving him when things are tough. He's been searching nearly his entire life for something known as The Queen's Dowry, a fortune in treasure that sunk aboard a ship in 1715. While hunting for this treasure, though, Benjamin must battle financial woes, a wife who still loves him but can't stand his antics (so much so that she's divorcing him), and the dangers being associated with a rapper/murderer who simply wants the benjamins.

The outlandish nature of just about everything makes the entire production minimally cerebral at best. Examples are 300-year-old canons resting at the bottom of the ocean but we're still able to read what's written on them. Explosions that knock divers out of the water but don't harm them in any way. A bimbo richese daughter who knows nothing about ...well ...anything. And the list goes on.

Movie had beautiful scenery views below the ocean and above. However I found the movie quite boring. It seemed like a movie made in the early 90s or even 80s. However maybe its target audience are divers since I think they would enjoy it.

The storyline is quite good and involved, with multiple threads flowing thru it.  First thread; Matthew's character, Finn, plays a shipwreck treasure hunter on the hunt for the Aurelia, a spanish ship carrying gold and other treasures between Spain and the New World.  Second thread; the treasure hunter's relationship with his estranged wife, played by Kate Hudson.  Third thread; the strained father-daughter relationship between Donald Sutherland's character and his spoiled daughter.  And the last thread is the 3-way race to find the sunken treasure.  The comedy is there, provided by all four threads, and the romance is not mushy.  Best of all, the ending of the story is not that predictable.",1234137600,2,842,5.147058823529412

3326429,2,B0012KJ0DK,"I know ""Fool's Gold"" is supposed to be mindless fun. The treasure-seeking story doesn't have to be believable as long as the film is fun to watch. I liked Matthew McConaughey's ""Sahara"" for what it was: good, clean fun of watching our hero doing what he is expected to do. I'm sorry to say this, but for me ""Fool's Gold"" turned out a disappointing entry from Matthew McConaughey who deserves a much better film.

Matthew McConaughey is a treasure hunter Finn, who is rather single-mindedly pursuing his dream - a Spanish ship loaded with gold, which has been lost for 300 years off the coast of Florida. Kate Hudson is his wife Tess, now divorcing him as she wants a new life in college. The story is all too familiar, but not bad. However, Andy Tennant, usually a competent director (whose CV includes ""Hitch"" and ""Ever After"") tells the story in an awfully slow and confusing way.

""Fool's Gold"" tries to be an action-adventure-comedy-romance, but it becomes none of them. There really isn't much thrilling action to speak of, let alone thrilling adventures. To make matters worse, there isn't much comedy or romance either. The film suffers contrived situations, confusing subplots and lack of style. The action/adventures become abruptly violent as characters get shot in the foot or harpooned in the thigh. Romance or love-hate relationship of Tess and Finn doesn't convince as they talk a lot about treasures and love, but either character (with their long, boring dialogues) doesn't really look serious about what he or she is talking about.

Both stars look great, it is true, and they are clearly having a good time. But Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, formerly seen together as the leads of a romantic comedy ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" does not have enough on-screen chemistry together to make us really care. Probably they are not to be blamed, but the weak script is, as it contains so many detracting factors. Stereotypical characters--Ewen Bremmer as British sidekick; Donald Sutherland as eccentric billionaire and Kevin Hart as murderous gangster (or rap star), etc--do not help, nor lack of coherent storyline that goes on and on, not knowing where to go. And as to the annoying, bikini-clad ""Gemma Honeycutt"" character, what can I say?

""Fool's Gold"" is a missed opportunity. It could have been more enjoyable like ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was fun with two likable leads (and their charisma as stars), beautiful locations and story full of adventures. ""Fool's Gold"" has all these things, but still fails to be entertaining, which is the greatest flaw.",1227225600,3,2583,4.944700460829493
3326430,1,B0012KJ0DK,I was very disappointed with this movie.  Did not care for it at all.  Tired old treasure hunt movie and the dialogue was very poor.,1226793600,5,132,4.24

3326433,4,B0012KJ0DK,"This a film that defies criticism.  It wasn't made to win awards.  If memory serves this flick was released around Valentine's Day to cash in on those taking their sweeties or intended sweeties to something lighthearted and romantic.  ""There Will Be Blood"" just wouldn't cut it.  In a nutshell, this is cinematic cotton candy.  I saw this film about two days ago and it's pretty much escaped my memory banks.  As was intended.  This could be characterized as a screwball action-adventure comedy though it falls a little short of Grant-Dunne or Powell-Loy.  That said the teaming of Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson sets off kinetic sparks.  They project both intelligence and sexual heat that is palpable.  The presence of Donald Sutherland as a mega-millionaire is always inviting.  Sit back and enjoy the show and remain optimistic that McConaughey and Hudson will one day appear in a vehicle that has a little more meat to it.",1223856000,,932,4.948387096774193
3326434,2,B0012KJ0DK,"I'll admit it, I got into ""Failure To Launch"" and gave it 4 stars. This on the other hand is a new low for all involved, which basically means it's barrel scraps. It's labeled as a romantic comedy, yet their were no real romantic moments, and the majority of the comedy comes from two minor gay cooks. Sure, there are other redeemable elements, but they're few and far between. It's National Treasure at sea, except less exiting, less humorous, and more juvenile (Wow, that's pretty bad). First the bad elements.

With the exception of a few Kate Hudson (although I would've preferred another Sarah Jessica Parker outing) and the general rough jerk-persona of Matthew McConaughey, the acting is bad to pathetic. The villains being the worst offenders, with not even that Cosby kid showing one bit of prose. Ray Winstone is bad as always, along with the main villain, Bunny, and his white hired gun. And poor old Donald Sutherland gives possibly the WORST performance of the movie, and/or his career. Matt's sidekick doesn't add to anything either. The story is unoriginal, and obviously little to no thought went into this treasure tale, so I won't dwell on the plot. The action is also mostly uninteresting.

Good elements? Well, Donald Sutherland's screen daughter does well as a stupid and ditsy Paris Hilton like character. There is some good humor involved, again mostly coming from two minor gay guys, and a few of Hudson's comments.

Amazingly, it could've been much worse, but not by much. Being from the director of ""Hitch,"" you'd expect something a bit more quality, but this movie has more holes than Hugh Hefner's water bed. This movie all but fails in what it set out to do, and I wouldn't even recommend this for renting. There's plenty of better date movies out there, so just say ""NO!"" to this movie, and move along. Not much to see here.

Real Score: 1.5",1223683200,,1871,4.765432098765432
3326435,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Here I thought this was going to be a cheesy chick-flick romance, but that's not all I got.  If I had to sum it up, I'd call it National Treasure at sea.  There was romance, of course, since the premise of the movie revolves around the hero and heroine and their failed marriage.  But most of the plot and action are not about that at all, and it focuses heavily on the search for the buried (sunken) treasure.

To add to it, there's a lot of action (and violence) combined with comedy reminiscent of Bad Boys.  People being flippant in serious situations and that sort of thing.  The characters are an interesting mix that add to the story, and while the ending is a little predictable, getting there is all the fun.

I very much enjoyed this movie even though I went into it with low expectations.  I say throw out your preconceived notions based on the promos and give it a try (if you like the National Treasure/Bad Boy type movies, of course).",1223424000,,948,4.408045977011494

3326438,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Spending life as a beachbum appeals to Finn (McConaughey).  So much so, in fact, that it cost him his wife Tess (Kate Hudson).  She was happy to be with him for some time, chasing his dreams of finding sunken Spanish treasure, but inevitably he never managed to find gold or strike it rich.  On the day of their wedding annulment, Finn finds a clue that may lead him to the riches that could make him famous and filthy rich, not to mention rekindling his marriage.

Once he links back up with Tess, the two go through relationship struggles, quirky scenarios, and with the help of a rich financier (Sutherland) and his dim-witted daughter Gemma (Dziena), they seek to find their treasures.  Facing an unscrupulous and criminal opponent nicknamed Bigg Bunny (Hart) - as well as his mischievous and sometimes bumbling crew - the dangerous race is on for the treasure.

Even though this is a complete rip-off of Into the Blue, and Kate Hudson is nowhere near Jessica Alba, it's a decent date movie nonetheless.  Whereas Into the Blue took the drama/suspense angle, Fool's Gold goes the romantic dramedy route.  With a few good laughs, a not-so-deep plot (and an appropriate title), the next move is constantly predictable, and it never really has a chance of being hilarious or memorable in any specific way.  Perhaps if the cocaine addicted sharks from Into the Blue were used, and Hudson was replaced with Alba, then this would be more highly regarded.  Otherwise, it's just two pretty people with average chemistry, in an idiotic yet likeable date movie.

In the end it's like deep-sea fishing and coming up with a license plate.  You're happy that something was hooked, but it's ultimately pointless.",1221955200,,1701,4.8477508650519034
3326439,5,B0012KJ0DK,"Question.  What's wrong with this movie?
Answer.  Nothing. Nothing other than it didn't contain graphic sex, the dismemberment of human bodies, or the ""F"" word every 5 seconds and it was a PG-13 rating. Granted it's not Oscar material but if ""No Country for Old Men"" can win big then who knows... This was a refreshing movie which shows that there is still some talent left in Hollywood that has the ability to write a good story and act. More movies need to be made in this manner. Give me more light hearted comedy mixed with romance, adventure, and some action.  Something I can sit down with my wife and kids to watch without having to worry about the Hollywood sewer line being emptied into their heads.
I think that there is a conspiracy in Hollywood to ruin movies like this with bad reviews and discouraging comment. Take the movie ""Sahara"" for example. This was a funny movie which was harpooned like a humpbacked whale by the critics. Once again this was not Oscar material but it was a good flick which entertained without dumbing down the audience or falling back on sex, drugs and bad language to fill out a poor script.
To those who panned ""Fools Gold"" I think you need to step down off the high horse. If you can't enjoy a simple well told story like ""Fools Gold"" for what it is and the talent the cast brings to the movie than there is indeed no hope for Hollywood.",1221523200,4,1381,4.450592885375494

Scenes that are supposed to be funny turn out to be tiring and exasperating to watch instead. The scene where Kate throws the dining plates at her hosts after going into shock while meeting her ex was too much and really not funny. Although the movie tries to nail the character Gemma as the dumb one most of the other cast make a wonderful fool of themselves instead with those tiring long scenes. In fact the character Gemma offered some respite.

3326444,3,B0012KJ0DK,"Admittedly, this is a contrived, predictable mystery, but that proves to be the focus rather than the romantic comedy that was promoted. But in the spirit of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, it's a spunky contrived, predictable mystery. No, the characters were not all complex, but at least the powers that be went to the trouble of making them entertaining and personable.

I liked the idea of looking for sunken treasure. I liked the upbeat island soundtrack. I liked the funny characters. I liked the pretty scenes and the silly lines. I liked the random explosions and fight scenes, as pleasantly ridiculous as they were.

Kate and Matthew have the chemistry they had in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". They have the sunny dispositions to pull off a mindless-but-fun storyline and to work with a wacky cast.

However, if you are  a) Looking for a fun film to kill ~2 hours, or b) an avid Kate Hudson fan, then this film won't dissapoint you that much.  Although their performances could have been better (such as in How to Lose a Guy), which might be attributed to a somewhat lacking script - Kate and Mat still manage to deliver that same chemistry they seem to exude with each other.

Now, the transfer itself - I found it to be pretty good overall.  Some of the ocean scenes look absolutely beautiful in BD, the sound is solid, and the transfer is pretty clean (no spots, not a lot of grain).  If anything, maybe the colors are a bit too saturated in some places, but in a film of this type, it works for it, rather than against it.

More of ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" as there is plenty of comedy along with the action, but some of the diving scenes and treasure history are reminiscent of ""The Deep"". Lots of romance and action that the most family should enjoy. Not for the little ones. When a man finds proof of a treasure in the ocean he has searched for years in all the wrong places, some criminals become very interested. The fact he accidentally bumps into his ex-wife only makes it more interesting since she is fluent in the study of treasures. There is a good chemistry here and plenty of action and laughs. If you enjoy McConaughey and/or Hudson you will probably want to at least rent it. My wife and I thought the trailers looked interesting enough that I went ahead and bought it. We enjoyed it thoroughly and I am glad I got it. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.

Unfortunately the formula has been used too many times and what we are given in Fool's Gold doesn't really add enough new twists to make it compelling enough to recommend as a buy.  Even as a rental, this one is a bit weak and something that could just as easily be passed over for something else.

This movie wanders territory between the 2 and 3 star range, and if possible, I'd plant it around 2.5 for the whole product.  The Blu-ray is relatively light on extras, but that may be more a matter of the studios showing us some mercy.  The gag reel that is included isn't all that funny and really doesn't show us much to keep us interested.  The Featurette: ""Fool's Gold: Flirting with Adventure - The Chemistry Between Two Charming Contemporary Stars"" makes up the remaining bonus material, but that's little more than 5 minutes of ego boosting material for the film's stars.

I fully expected to hate this movie when my husband rented it.  About 20 minutes in I decided that this was a fun, light hearted popcorn flick.  The movie it reminded me the most of was ""Romancing the Stone"" though McConaughey is no Douglas, it's still a movie in that vein.  Fun, light hearted with a splash of adventure, amusing romance, some slightly over the top action, and treasure.

Quick Summary: Finn and Tess are getting divorced because he's an irresponsible bum/ wanna-be treasure hunter and she wants more out of life.  The day their divorce is final, Finn finds a piece of the treasure they had been hunting for.  They begin their hunt, while dodging Finn's competitors and previous thugg ""benefactors"", all while trying to win back the love of his now ex-wife.

Kate Hudson is a good actress, and she's really funny. She has a way of delivering her lines differently than I think other actresses would...she is more subtle when saying her punch lines, but that makes them even more hilarious.

The movie was fun and quite an adventure, but I would have liked to have seen more of the on screen romance on screen and not hidden behind books or tables or whatever.

I have to add that I do love Mr. McConaughey to pieces, but there is just something about his accent that makes all his characters seem like the same guy in different movies. I would love to hear him try a British accent sometime or even just something more straightforward and plain rather than southern. And I love looking at him, but I would like to see him in a role where he doesn't take his shirt off at all.",1214784000,,1065,4.423469387755102

This movie, although not the deepest plot in history, is a great, fun movie to watch, especially with a significant other. It's a great adventure flick with plenty of laughs for everyone. The scenery makes you want to go to Key West, and the special effects are getting better and better.

Finn is a die-hard treasure hunter who loves the Florida history and the mysteries that the ocean holds. He's carefree, walks around barefoot, and is totally, completely broke. His soon-to-be-ex-wife Tess, is down to earth, smart, hardworking, yet still has a side that is just as carefree and fun-loving as Finn.

Finn borrows money from a dangerous rapper to finance fixes on his boat in order to search for a 300-year-lost treasure at the bottom of the bay. Instead, Finn accidentally sinks his boat and suddenly owes a lot of money to a dangerous man. Tess is divorcing him because he is irresponsible and broke, and then circumstances throw them together with an unlikely crowd: A millionaire and his daughter (Donald Sutherland and Alexis Dziena), the Ukraine (Ewen Bremner), and a couple of odd cooks on the millionaire's yacht.

Some time through the movie, they have a revelation that they've been searching in the wrong place and one clue after another finally leads them to one of the greatest treasures in history.

There's something here for everyone, which means that Finn is tanned and muscular and behaves like a refugee from Parrothead Island (for the girls) and Tess is elegant and lithe and bright in a bikini (for the boys). They both spend most of this film wet and half-naked, never a bad thing. A good supporting role is played by Donald Sutherland, who plays the multibillionaire grubstaking the adventure.

Of course, Finn and Tess drive each other crazy as newly-divorced but continuing business partners. The barbed affection between them provides most of the energy of FOOL'S GOLD. There are bad guys also searching for the treasure, so there's some action mixed in with the adventure.

This movie is pure fluff, but it's fun fluff because it's so obviously evident that everyone had a great time on set making this film. It's a good way to spend 100 minutes on your couch eating corn chips and drinking soda.",1214092800,2,1142,4.786802030456853

3326488,4,B0012KJ0DK,"Benjamin ""Finn"" Finnegan (Matthew McConaughey) is a beach bum with an interest in treasure hunts.  He's also hardly responsible, which is why he sets his boat on fire and sinks it not too long after we meet him.

Tess Finnegan (Kate Hudson) has had enough.  She's taken a job aboard millionaire Nigel Honeycutt's (Donald Sutherland) yacht.  And she's divorcing Finn.

Finn's latest quest is the Queen's Dowry, a treasure lost almost 300 years ago.  In fact, he's found a piece of it.  Now all he needs is financial backing.  His irresponsibility has left his last backer rather mad at him.  So he decides to get Nigel's help, completely unaware that Nigel is Tess's new boss.

Unfortunately, the shipwreck is somewhere around the island owned by dangerous rapper Bigg Bunny (Kevin Hart).  As in Finn's last investor.  Can they find the treasure without Bigg getting his hands on it?  Can Finn win Tess back in the process?

Let's be honest, this is mindless, predictable entertainment.  Especially since the previews gave away many of the key scenes.  But it is fun.

It's trying to be a action comedy.  It had some laughs, but there weren't as many as I had hoped.  The funniest scenes involved Nigel's daughter Gemma as played by Alexis Dziena.  Anytime she was on screen, I was guaranteed a laugh.  Most of the action in the film was played for laughs as well, and is over the top.  Then again, what action movie isn't over the top?  Even the exposition scene near the beginning that is key to understanding how Tess and Finn got started on this trail wasn't that great.  I couldn't follow it, and I tried.

So why did I like it?  Because of the characters.  I really did care for all of them.  Well, the good guys anyway.  Credit for this obviously goes to the actors who are obviously having so much fun making the film.  Frankly, they made it hard for me not to like it.

The cast is varied and each performance hit the target.  I keep hearing about shirtless and muscles is everyone fixated on chests?  Did you see Kate Hudson in a swimsuit?  She looked stunning and all you reviewers are not getting the point.  The film is excellent even if it seemed childish but it actually felt natural and we just ease into the adventure.  Some of the stunts were astonishing and awesome to look at.  And includes a sort of brutal death of a hated bad guy.  It was a short of hybrid of everything I enjoy, a great script, a good director, a cast of great actors, action, comedy, gore, violence, a hell of a good time, and a clever story.

Usually when actors in a hit movie have great chemistry, it doesn't mean that their next movie together will be such a hit.  I love How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days, but this is very disappointing.  They still had the same chemistry but instead of being really outrightly hillarious, it was more silly than anything.  It's a predictable mystery movie rather than being a completely romantic comedy and you really felt as if you were the ones on a treasure hunt.  I thought Donald Sutherland was very good in here and I also thought that Kate did a great job with her physical comedy and also the location was stunning.
You have to see this for yourself to make up your own mind.  It would seem that people are fairly much evenly divided between loving and hating it, and I'm somewhere in the middle.  Go see this expecting some funny stupidity and a few good one liners and not expect Oscar material from it.  It's definately a DVD movie rather than a movie theatre viewing.
