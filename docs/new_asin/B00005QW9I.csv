1651928,1,B00005QW9I,This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.  I should have known better with Martin Lawrence and Danny Devito staring.  Have these guys ever done anything good?  I don't think so.  You really have to be ML or DD fan to sit through this movie.  You have been warned.  Do the right thing and stay away from this movie.,1014595200,,334,4.140625
1651929,2,B00005QW9I,"Nah, I just did not like this movie. Only 2 scenes were funny. Besides, what's so funny about 2 guys trying to get 1 ring while they con everybody else???
Booo.
Too many distractions in the movie.",1013904000,,196,4.324324324324325
1651930,5,B00005QW9I,I enjoy movies that make me laugh and I laughed 'til I couldn't breathe.,1010620800,2,72,4.214285714285714
1651931,1,B00005QW9I,"Despite having likable comedic stars like Martin Lawrence and Danny DeVito in the cast, this movie was painful to watch.  The plot was all over the place.  I swear, I haven't seen a movie with such bad direction before!  Being a fan of both Lawrence and DeVito, I had high hopes for this film. Thankfully, I only rented it so it wasn't an expensive disappointment.
The one star is earned by the movie's supporting cast - the only positive part of the film, in my opinion.  William Fichter (sp?) is a hoot as an effeminate detective and stand-up comic Larry Miller is hilarious as well.  Unforunately, their performances don't make up for the fact that this flick has no idea where it's going.
If you want to watch a good Martin Lawrence film, buy BAD BOYS or BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE. If you want to get a funny Danny DeVito movie, get TWINS or OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.  This movie will give you a headache.  Avoid it at all costs.",1010534400,3,921,4.446428571428571

1651933,3,B00005QW9I,"While ""What's the Worst that Can Happen"" was far from the best comedy I've seen, I was very impressed by many of the supporting actors and bit players.  Of particular note although somewhat overlooked by the critics was the voluptuous Sascha Knopf, who portrays the centerfold.  Although the role is largely a prop, the stunning Ms Knopf handles it with grace and style and a subdued comic aptitude that tells me she will be back in other roles.  Sascha is absolutely gorgeous and the fact that she can act can't help but make her more appealing!!  In addition to rather large . . . ahem, assets up front, she also possesses full, voluptuous lips that are highly expressive, a striking poise that you might expect to find on a much taller actress,  and big beautiful hands that are noticeable for their own unique style in many of her scenes.  She is one to watch for stardom to come!",991785600,7,884,4.563291139240507
1651934,5,B00005QW9I,"Let me tell you folks, the worst that could happen is that you miss this hilarious movie.  Martin Lawrence is one crazy guy, and that Danny DeVito is so short! Martin's a crook, and Danny is a big businessman (only he's not actually very big, get it?!) and they get into this big fight over a ring. So the question becomes 'who is the real crook?' and it might just be Mister Capitalist Danny DeVito. So you see, there's a whole anti-globalization, crypto-Marxist dialectic going on in there, which will give you something to ponder as you chew your popcorn. When you're not laughing that is!  If this isn' t the best film ever made, my name's not David Manning",991699200,14,661,4.5
1651935,4,B00005QW9I,"I enjoyed this movie. A little goofy here and there....but when I saw Danny doing a stunt scene, that was just funny. Worth watching",1512518400,,132,4.541666666666667

1651937,1,B00005QW9I,I remember when Hollywood comics made movies that were funny without using foul language or crude sexual humor. I didn't think there was anything funny about this movie at all.,1512259200,,176,4.9

1651940,1,B00005QW9I,"With the actors who were in this film, you'd think it would be outstanding. One used to be able to watch a movie and simply enjoy the STORY. Not anymore. No. For some reason, now, anytime there is a black or Latino person in a movie, you are ASSURED it includes white hate. WTH? 'Oh, look at this watch; now I can move into a white neighborhood.' What the heck is that? That racist slur has nothing to do with the story or the plot. I guess all film schools can close now that no one needs any acting talent. They just need to say a few racial slurs against white people per move, and they're golden. My favorite actors didn't appear racist before, but they sure are now. They're scared of being accused of not being ""black enough"", so better slam those white people more. I'm done. Hollywood, when you decide to make movies again, with real talent, plot, scene, and drama, I'll start buying your product. Hate is not an art form.",1510963200,3,930,4.350574712643678

DD, solid. ML, solid. Supporting cast, great. There's a delightful richness to this movie. I can't say you'll watch it more than once or twice, but it's certainly worth once or twice. Good people, good movie, good pace. Watch it.

We laugh throughout this movie every time we see it. I guess it depends on your type of comedy, as Martin and DeVito are always funny to us. Loved Devito in Taxi...

1652115,1,B00005QW9I,"The premise of the movie is this: Martin plays a thief who meets his match when a crooked billionaire(played by Danny Devito) steals his ring in a botched robbery attempt. Martin goes out of his way to get his ring back by making a fool of the billionaire.

My opinion: The movie is Saturday Night Live dull. Martin as well as Danny Devito(who should have known better than to go along with this tedious movie) are not funny. The effeminate cop was hilarious and that is about all the laughs you will get out of this dumb movie. I watched it when I was visiting a cousin who stayed in Trenton, New Jersey and rued the day I was curious enough to see this wreck. The movie was about as dry as the Sahara desert and should be a shoe in for a razzie award. If this doesnt make your worst movie lists then I am at a loss for words. Have trouble sleeping? Watch this. It's litterally visual tranqulizer.",1206057600,,898,4.2823529411764705

  The plot is one thief robbing the other, the difference is, one is a dirty business man, and a dirt-bag all day long, the other does his deal at night,and is lovable during the day. The way it plays out, its hard to decide who you want to cheer",1193702400,4,380,4.053333333333334
1652119,1,B00005QW9I,"So not funny, I am a fan of Martin Lawrence's comedyflicks but this just isn't funny... and what's up with the gay fashion policeofficer?

Danny Devito isn't funny at all in this film, and he ahas the lead in it so it gets really annoying watching it...

Even BLACK KNIGHT was 5 times better... do not even rent this movie...",1122163200,2,325,4.4
1652120,1,B00005QW9I,"Five minutes in, I was cringing. Fifteen minutes in, I was in pain. It rates one star because the cinematography, lighting, sound, and other techical crews did competent work -- and because it's the lowest rating on the form.

If you love a good comedy caper, read the Donald Westlake book this atrocity was based on. It's clever, thrilling and hilarious -- everything the movie ain't. If you *must* get your comedy capers in movie form, get The Hot Rock instead. On the other hand, if your idea of brilliant humor is the stuff that cracks up 12-year-olds when they think they're being naughty, hey, this may be right up your alley.",1109203200,7,632,4.642857142857143
1652121,3,B00005QW9I,"Starts out with good timing, and some decent laughable banter from Martin Lawrence. Nothing laugh out loud funny but pleasantly amusing schtick.  The central premise is actually quite interesting (billionaire stealing a ring from a petty robber etc), but the film fails to take advantage of it, choosing instead to lapse into numerous plot-holes, cliches and mind-bending stupidity. There's even a gay, dog-loving detective who adds fart humor to the mix. And all this leads to a climax that takes a quantum leap of logic and rationality. Perhaps a worthy rental if you're into slapstick, but overall a skippable fare.",1085875200,9,618,5.18

1652123,2,B00005QW9I,"This lackluster comedy simply fails to deliver sufficient laughs per hour to justify spending the time to watch it.  Martin Lawrence, who is normally a funny guy, just isn't on his game in this flick.  Danny DeVito is better, but the material doesn't give him much with which to work.
There is a lot of talent wasted on stereotype bits that are more insulting than comical.  William Fichtner's flamingly effeminate detective would only be funny to homophobes.  John Leguizamo's Arab imitation is less humorous now than it might have been before September 11.
The only really funny bit in the film is a strictly visual gag by Stephanie Clayman as the sign language interpreter.  Without virtue of a solitary line of dialogue, she single handedly produces all the most hilarious moments in the film.
This film is a dud.  I rated it 3/10.  Martin Lawrence fans are likely to be disappointed.",1036195200,3,888,4.841059602649007

1652125,2,B00005QW9I,"This movie doesn't deserve to much time from me.  The best part about this movies is BOSTON.  It was filmed in Boston, and as a life time Massachusetts resident, I loved seeing our fair city in yet, another of the handful of films actually filmed here.
It is a city that looks beautiful on film.
Lawrence is playing his usual role of the petty thief who dances and talks way through the film.  ....
I do usually like Danny Devito, but I don't know what he was thinking here.  His character, Max, has a few funny moments, ....
Lawrence robs Devito, and Devito is in the house when it happens.  He steals the ring Lawrence is wearing.  The rest of the movie is Lawrence trying to get the ring back.
This movie didn't make me laugh much.  When I was laughing, it was when Detective Tardio was on screen. What a hoot!  William Fichtner plays him, and he is weird! really weird. At first, I didn't know what the heck his character was for, but I realize now that the movie needed him.  He was the best that happened...",1020124800,6,1013,4.317460317460317
1652126,5,B00005QW9I,"Martin Lawrence is the man, just flat out awesome.  The way he says ahhhhhhhhhhh and dances when he saw the cars that Max had was pure genius.  And the detective Tardido was hysterical he made me cry from laughter.  The movie was just to funny for words, and John L. was great too.  But if anyone has a problem with my review I just have to say grow up it is year 2002, the movie is about smiles not crys so see it.  Everything is funny about the movie, even the bad who is played by Danny ""I am short"" DeVito.

There's no high brow comedy here, but that's not what it aspires to be.  Martin Lawrence is the biggest problem with this movie, and the (sometimes) stellar supporting cast just isn't enough to save this movie from him.  It's not that I don't like Martin Lawrence, generally, but he doesn't have the chops to pull off the lead in this flick.
