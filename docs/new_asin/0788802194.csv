80721,5,0788802194,This movie is filled with a sad story of girl whose mother died when she was very young anyways later on her dad meets the stepmother and the dad dies. the stepmother makes her work all day and her only companions are the  animals around the kingdom. I grew up loving this movie with all my heart  I'm sure other little kids will like it too. this is the best movie  earth!  I can't wait till they re-realease this movie!,963532800,,421,4.225
80722,2,0788802194,"typically, whether i like to admit it or not, i enjoy the older disney animated features.  this film is definitely an exception to the rule.  the first 15-20 minutes are primarily devoted to the mice.  5 minutes of this  would've been more than enough.  in fact, the mice pretty much dominated  most of the action in this cartoon.  cinderella is an absolute pushover,  her character is silly and flat.
the film does however follow the story  closely:  the fairy godmother, the wicked stepmother, the glass slipper.  this does not save the film, and halfway through i found myself enduring it  just to see it through.",963187200,3,616,4.761904761904762

81075,4,0788802194,"I bought this version in case it wasn't computer-filled and not hand-colored. Of course, it wasn't...so I thought. I paused the video at one point to do something, and when I looked at it again, I saw that Jaq's foot didn't have one solid bright color in it, filled by the computer, but was darker in some places and lighter in others, seemingly hand-colored! Also, some of the sparkles on Cinderella's dress were as well! In the original that was done by hand, sparkles were little white spots, not the shape of a ""t"" or diamond. I found one or two of those. The disk played fine. It wasn't Blu-ray or in some other language. I purchased the one shown. About the story, I don't like that so much is focused on the animals and was almost dreading that part, but the story still has that beautiful and classic touch to it, which I wanted and was more than I expected. Ilene Woods (Cinderella) is actually an alto and sounds just as beautiful as Aurora, a soprano. It's worth watching and keeping.",1490054400,2,995,4.472527472527473

I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Cinderella (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a classic Disney movie with quotable lines that you will remember (and use!) years down the road. But underneath the memorability, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

81447,1,0788802194,"To begin with, I had great expectations from this movie since it's a disney movie. I know this is an old movie but I had exoected that they would age remade this one with some special effects to appeal to the children of this generation.
I got more irritated because Amazon did not give me the option to preview. If I would have previewed I would have never bought this movie.
My 5 year old who is totally hooked to 'Frozen' since a year now, did not even sit through the entire 'Cinderella' movie got over.
I am so disappointed that my money has gone down the drain. Also I strongly feel not all Disney movies should have the same pricing.. I have no regrets in buying frozen and spending 15$ for the same. But this one I am so disappointed and disheartened.. Amazon should keep the proving based on how old the move is OR atleast give the option of cancelling the purchase within first 30 mins or something.
I have been a Prime customer since 2 years, this is the first product with which I am completely disheartened...:(((",1470787200,,1026,4.405263157894737

While we didn't explain to her what happened with Cinderella parents, she took everything else in stride and didn't dwell on where are Cinderella's mommy & daddy. She quickly understood that step-mother was wicked, step-sisters ""mean, and silly, and not nice"" and that prince was bored with other girls until he saw Cinderella and that she was fun for him to be friends with! She has seen it 3 times during last weekend and I have a feeling that she'll be watching it over and over again.

Few thought that, but my granddaughter, just 4 did.  I don't know why people think it is about glass slippers and women depending on men. Not at all. It is about keeping a positive outlook and believing in yourself while overcoming adversity.  The songs are so beautiful, and hand animation is still so much finer and smoother than today's 3d.

81976,5,0788802194,"On a single, DVD-disc, this 75-minute, timeless, Disney, animated classic, centers on the fact that dreams, hopes and wishes, really do... come true! In vivid color, this digitally mastered CINDERELLA, depicts the beloved story of a beautiful girl who was confined to her house by way of needless, household chores... that were heaped upon her, by her cruel and jealous stepmother. And ironically, she was forced into domestic bondage within her own home, by her late, father. And, as if that were not enough, her two ugly stepsisters only added to her burdens, with their selfish, self-centeredness and obnoxious pettiness. As does Lucifer, the malicious and conniving Cat, who you love to hate. But, CINDERELLA has some loyal friends, as well. Bruno the Dog, Gus the Mouse along with the rest of the household mice and a goodly, Fairy Godmother. Who, with the wave of her wand, transforms CINDERELLA to look like the lovely, elegant, woman that she is, within. So, that like all the ladies in the land, she too..., can attend the royal ball and perhaps, meet and marry the handsome and eligible, Prince Charming. But, the royal ball for CINDERELLA ends at midnight and the wicked stepmother incorporates vicious, cruel and deceptive measures to ensure that CINDERELLA doesn't reunite with her Prince. But, not to fear. CINDERELLAS' animal friends are near... and Bruno the Dog, makes a point of getting back at Lucifer the Cat. And, the glass slipper which CINDERELLA lost at the ball which was found by a royal Stuart? Much to the horror of her evil, arrogant, stepmother and pompous, self-centered, selfish and very ugly, stepsister's, CINDERELLA has a little surprize of her own, to ensure that she gets the handsome, loving, Prince... that she so rightly, deserves. An animated Disney classic that is a favorite with each new generation. Treasure and enjoy... and don't for get the popcorn! Nina Kish",1448668800,,1906,5.0157728706624605

82553,1,0788802194,"This review is about the blu ray DVD authoring and not the content of the movie.  The movie cannot be stopped and then restarted from the same place.  It starts over each time.  Thus if one cannot watch the entire film in one sitting one has to write the place stopped on a piece of paper and then fast forward to that spot when watching it again.  Blu ray in many respects is a step backward since all standard DVD have a ""resume play"" feature.  Even with blu ray ""resume play"" can be activated but it requires some thoughtfulness on the part of the DVD creators.  To assume that people watch at home the same way they watch in a movie theater is short sighted.",1419552000,,662,4.256

82595,5,0788802194,"Naturally, there's an untimely death to begin with (this wouldn't be Disney if one or both parents weren't already dead).  Poor Cinderella, orphaned (but for her EVIL stepmother who quickly takes over and reduces Cinderella to a scullery maid.  The girl didn't need a fairy godmother, she needed a good lawyer!).  Thank goodness for her animal buddies who can sing and dance to cheer her up.  Even though she's in rags, they're very well dressed (because naked animals wouldn't do).  Meanwhile, in the castle on the hill, there plots an old geezer desperate to get his son married off so he can have grandchildren.  Basically, he just wants breeding stock.  Yes I know, I was shocked too, but that's the gist of it.  The manipulative bugger throws a ball to find a suitable wife for his son.  And by suitable he means capable of producing heirs.  Of course Cinderella is sort of invited too, providing she can get her work done AND make herself an appropriate grown for the event.  (It pays to have rodents on hand with sewing skills.)  No surprise, the dress is ripped to shreds leaving her a wreck, crying in some old lady's lap.  ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" she gets a replacement to wear, plus shoes that aren't shatter-proof, and before you know it, there's a bounty on her head.

This movie was a gamble for Disney to make.  His studio was over $4 million in debt following the disastrous box office bombs Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi.  They were on the verge of bankruptcy, desperately in need of a hit to pull them out of the hole they found themselves in.  Fortunately, Cinderella proved to be a big success.

Oddly enough, my favorite character is Lady Tremaine (Eleanor Audley).  She's perfectly sinister, abusive, and malicious; absolutely riveting.  Okay, Gus-gus is cute, as is Jaq (both voiced by Jimmy MacDonald).",1416441600,,1826,4.829032258064516

82597,5,0788802194,One of Disney's truly great animated movies that has withstood the passing of time and has been enjoyed by legions of children (as well as grown-ups alike) for decades and will surely continue to bring enjoyment to one and all for untold decades to come.  It is so sad that we apparantly won't ever be entertained by real Disney animation hand drawn by real and talented animators ever again what with the new computer generated junk we now get being cranked out.  Bet Mr. Disney spins in his grave every time the Disney Studio releases another computer generated product.  So sad that the real animation industry has been lost.,1416182400,2,628,4.743119266055046

Seller was prompt and DVD arrived in good condition, exactly as described which is more than I can say about the boot-leg Chinese copy of Beauty and the Beast I got from a different seller.

83269,5,0788802194,"I'm kinda surprised that people actually find Cinderella boring considering that Aurora doesn't do much in the movie besides sleeping and the movie itself doesn't really have an interesting plot to follow through. I personally think that Cinderella and the characters and the plot were far more interesting and engaging than the ones on Sleeping Beauty. Plus, Sleeping Beauty feels more forgettable while Cinderella has more iconic songs, an actual THEME that motivates people to live out their dreams, iconic scenes, and characters. Also, the villain in Sleeping Beauty doesn't even touch the evil stepmother in Cinderella. Beauty & the Beast and Cinderella have been always been a childhood favorites of mines. Everything about those films just stands out to me more than Sleeping Beauty. I find them to be much more timeless.

I actually find the the stepsisters and the stepmother to have far more developed, stronger personalities than the fairies in which really adds more excitement to the film. The characters in Sleeping Beauty were just pretty weak and less developed including Aurora herself. The fairies just don't have the personalities that nearly stand out like the stepsisters/stepmother. They pretty much reminded me of the mice in Cinderella. They were just pretty bland and basic in comparison. I think Cinderella did had some emotionally engaging scenes particularly the ones with the stepmother and the stepsisters. The way they treated and talk down to Cinderella. For that reason, I felt more sympathy for Cinderella. I didn't felt anything in Sleeping Beauty like it didn't gave me that same sympathizing effect like Cinderella's. Cinderella feels like a much more relatable character in that aspect because she was miserable inside and had dreams for a better life. She's a much more admirable character because of her strong work ethic and she suffered more hardships in life. She wasn't just some spoiled brat that was born into royalty. I just think Cinderella stands out more because it has more of a timeless feel to it. It has the theme, well developed characters, the songs, the villains, and iconic scenes that leaves an impressionable, lasting memory on me. Sleeping Beauty doesn't really have a theme or a great message you can really learn and reflect on. It's not really clear in the film. Not to mention it doesn't have the iconic catchphrases like 'bibidiboppityboo"". It was just an okay film.

As I mentioned before, the the movie shows more depth in theme, songs, scenes and its characters. I find it to be far more emotionally engaging than Sleeping Beauty. Cinderella seems more like a well admirable/relatable character with a strong work ethic. She is someone that I actually sympathizes because how she was treated. The stepsisters and stepmother were very well developed in character than the fairies and most of the characters in Sleeping Beauty. The movie and the songs overall just feel more timeless and iconic to me. Sleeping Beauty was good I guess, but it doesn't nearly have half of the things that Cinderella has to make it far more exceedingly, engaging film. SnowWhite was good too and had the iconic characters and songs, but the plot is too similar to Sleeping Beauty while Cinderella's heartwarming plot differentiates from both movies even more and has my heart. It completely won me as a fan. I don't think a villain necessarily has to have any special powers to be more effective. I think it's pretty cliche and redundant to have every villain made to be that way, but as long as there is a special motive behind it that makes them what they are in character. People rave about the animation in Sleeping Beauty, but I am far more interested in the plot than the superficial effects. I tend to favor movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame that have a more insightful approach rather than a superficial appeal. That's why I choose the songs and story from Cinderella because it has more depth and significance in theme. I love how it's about overcoming adversities and it basically relates to everything I have been through in life.",1388880000,,4120,4.969565217391304
83270,3,0788802194,"As others have mentioned, ""Cinderella"" was an attempt by Disney Studios to regain their former glory as an animation giant. There was, of course, ""The Three Caballeros"" and ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,"" but [possibly due in part to WWII] it had been eight years since Disney really made a serious and noteworthy animated film (""Bambi"" in 1942). While it contains some lovely artwork, fine animation, and a couple of memorable songs, personally I don't think it ranks with their best efforts. It tries very hard to be both cute and meaningful, and I enjoyed it a lot more as a kid. However, I don't think it was until ""Alice in Wonderland"" that Disney truly recaptured its old magic. It was then followed by ""Peter Pan,"" ""Lady and the Tramp"" and finally ""Sleeping Beauty,"" which brought the decade to a triumphant conclusion. Perhaps ""Cinderella"" was a good and necessary first step for Disney Studios to get itself back on track, and in that regard, it was an important film in their history.",1388880000,,1004,4.775862068965517

It still opens talking points for mothers and stepmothers to relate to their daughters.  Still just as visually stunning as more modern CGI movies, but with the softer hand drawn touch.

83418,4,0788802194,"CINDERELLA--2-Disc Special Edition, Released 10-4-05/Rated G/74-minute run-time

Walt Disney's 1950 animated classic, ""Cinderella,"" was originally inspired by Charles Perrault's fairy tale ""Cinderillon.""  As the twelfth edition in the series of Walt Disney Animated Classics, ""Cinderella"" became a saving-grace for the studio [which had previously suffered considerable losses on ""Pinocchio,"" ""Fantasia,"" and ""Bambi""]; the success of ""Cinderella"" put Disney back on track for the first time since the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" and allowed Disney to form its own distribution company.  ""Cinderella"" currently holds a rating of 97% from Rotten Tomatoes.  ""Cinderella"" joins ""Aladdin,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" and ""Mulan"" in my list of favorite Disney Princess-Movies; despite being a pretty independent female, I rewatch these movies often not only to reminisce with my childhood, but also because, for a moment, it can be very comforting to fantasize about living a fairy tale.  I hardly ever watch the `special features' from DVDs, but for this movie in particular, I thought they were extremely interesting; the behind-the-scenes clips provide insight on how many of the Disney Animated Classics came to be as well as describe the process of creating some of my favorite animated films.

DIRECTORS:  Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, and Wilfred Jackson.

SONG WRITERS:  Mark David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman.

CAST:  Ilene Woods as Cinderella, Eleanor Audley as Lady Tremaine, Lucille Bliss as Anastasia Tremaine, Don Barclay as Footman, June Foray as Lucifer, Betty Lou Gerson as Narrator, Luis Van Rooten as Grand Duke/King, Jimmy MacDonald as Jaq/Gus/Bruno, William Phippe as Prince Charming, Rhoda Williams as Drizella Tremaine, and Verna Felton as Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella's style and grace are credited to influences from both her live-action model, Helene Stanley, and her voice actor, Ilene Woods.  Prince Charming, modeled after Jeffrey Stone, initially played a larger role in the film; some of the cut scenes survive in the video game ""Kingdom Hearts:  Birth by Sleep.""

SUMMARY:

A widowed aristocrat wants his gentle and sweet daughter, Cinderella, to have all the fortunes life can offer, including a mother's care.  Hoping to fill this void, he marries the cunning Lady Tremaine--who also has two daughters, Anastasia and Drizella.  The stepsisters serve as foil characters to Cinderella; they are rude, annoying, and inherently jealous of Cinderella's grace and beauty.  When her father passes away, Cinderella is left as the mercy of her new step-family who, in turn, force Cinderella into servitude.  Over the years, Cinderella is treated like a slave by the Tremaines and their cat, Lucifer; Cinderella finds comfort in Bruno, her dog, and by befriending several mice that inhabit the estate.  The mice also provide much of the movie's comic relief as well as a voice for the frustration Cinderella must feel regarding her poor treatment.

Meanwhile, the King is determined to see his son marry.  Hoping the Prince will find love soon, the King tasks his Duke to plan a grand ball in which Prince Charming will be made to dance with every eligible maiden in the land.  Lady Tremaine is determined to see one of her daughters marry the Prince, so when Cinderella requests to attend the ball, her stepmother agrees on the condition that Cinderella first completes an impossibly long list of chores.  Resolved to see Cinderella to the ball, Jaq, Gus, and the other mice get to work on making a dress; they borrow an unwanted string of beads and sash from Drizella and Anastasia.  Somehow, Cinderella manages to complete her chores in time to leave for the ball; a surprised and fearful Lady Tremaine notices Cinderella is wearing her daughters' discarded beads and sash, allowing Drizella and Anastasia a reason to tear apart Cinderella's gown.  With nothing to wear to the ball, Cinderella is left behind and the Chateau while her stepsisters ride off to meet the Prince.

All of Cinderella's woes culminate as she weeps in the courtyard.  Suddenly, her Fairy Godmother appears to bestow on her a ball-gown, carriage, and glass slippers for her dainty feet; the only caveat is that the spell with end at the stroke of midnight, meaning Cinderella must hurry.  At the ball, the Prince is bored and unimpressed with the maidens--at least until he catches a glimpse of Cinderella.  Prince Charming sleeps Cinderella away into a dreamlike love.  Just before midnight, Cinderella remembers the spell and quickly runs away before her stagecoach and gown are turned back into a pumpkin and rags; the only clue the Prince has to his love's identity is a glass slipper left behind on the palace steps.

In order to find Prince Charming's mystery Princess, the Grand Duke takes the glass slipper to every home in the kingdom, attempting to find the lady it fits.  Suspecting the Cinderella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine locks her away in the attic bedroom.  Suspense peaks when the Duke arrives at the last home in the kingdom, the Tremaine Estate.  Jaq and Gus scramble to steal the bedroom's key and carry it up the steps to free Cinderella.  Drizella and Anastasia fail to cram their feet into the glass slipper; the Duke is just about to leave when Cinderella breaks free.  In a final stand, Lady Tremaine sees that the glass slipper shatters before it can be tried on Cinderella's foot--killing any chance of identifying her as the mystery Princess.

83472,5,0788802194,"Cinderella is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on February 15, 1950. Cinderella is the of a beautiful woman who has become a maid in her own home due to her stepmother squandering the family fortune own her own daughters. One day an invitation to the ball arrives and the wicked stepmother tells Cinderella that only ""if"" she gets her chores done then she can goes to the ball. It is late at night and her chores are done, but has little time to get her dress done. Unbeknown to her the mousses and birds have got her dress ready for her. Cinderella rushes down stairs to go to the ball but her stepsisters tear apart her dress. Cinderella runs to the garden and begins to cry. Cinderella's fairy godmother appears and gets her ready for the ball. The best part about this movie is the rescue scene where Jaq and Gus steal the key from the stepmother and get it all away to the top of the stairs to rescue Cinderella. This was Disney's first full length animated film in eight years. This was the first Disney movie that the famous Nine Old Men worked on together. Now the only thing that I dislike about this two DVD set is disc two. It is information overkill and half of this stuff can go. The movie Cinderella gets an AAAAA+++++.

83473,5,0788802194,Was shipped quickly and in brand new condition! My little girl LOVES the movie! We are happy to have this classic in our dvd collection.,1380931200,,136,4.48
83474,5,0788802194,"My mom was hoping to receive Cinderella on DVD since her older VHS copy had seen better days.  Of course I always turn to Amazon first to find good prices and sure enough they were the cheapest of any of the places I checked.  This is a really nice version of the movie with a bunch of special features (we didn't watch them yet though) and of course the picture quality is great.  This is a good addition to anyone's movie collection, especially for Disney fans.",1380931200,,463,4.3604651162790695
83475,5,0788802194,It the genuine Disney Cinderella (as opposed to some 2 bit knock off). The box contains two disks and they both play in the players that they are intended to play in.,1380672000,,166,4.21875
83476,5,0788802194,This is such a classic Disney movie. I loved this movie as a little girl and loved watching classic Disney movies when I would go stay at my grandparent's and can't wait for my little ones to watch it.,1380499200,,201,4.17948717948718
83477,4,0788802194,"So far I have Snow White, Peter Pan, Alice, Fantasia, The Princess And The Frog, and now Cinderella and the quality of Disney's transfers to Blu-Ray are astonishingly beautiful. I had not seen Cinderella since I was a kid seeing it at the movies when it was re-released in the 60s, and as a 54 year old man reviewing this most estrogen-rich of the ""Classic Disney"" offerings it is a treat of a story even if the animation is decidedly several notches below its contemporaries ""Alice"" and ""Peter Pan"". I had forgotten how funny the mice are, for example. The story moves right along, MUCH better than Peter Pan which does not really get going until the pirates show up. However, if your are a fan of Disney animation, Cindy is a bit of a letdown. The only real moment that will make you go ""WOW!"" is the bubbles scene at the beginning; it is simply brilliant but it lasts for only 15 seconds. The scenes at the palace are well done, but overall both Alice and Peter Pan are far superior in comparison. Overall, it is still a great movie, the Blu-Ray transfer is impeccable, the story is fun, the animation quality is decidedly inferior to the others from the ""Classic Disney"" era, but for $20 from Amazon vs $30 retail it is worth every penny and I will be enjoying it for years to come. Rating: 4 Stars",1380412800,,1302,4.429166666666666
83478,5,0788802194,This is a real hit with my granddaughter  My daughter said she has watched it no less than 30 times in 3 weeks,1379721600,,110,3.782608695652174
83479,2,0788802194,"I am very disappointed with the Spanish translation. Whoever is the voice of Cinderella speaks with the same flat tone of voice throughout the movie, not like e original translation! The voices are different, sometimes they skip scenes, the songs sound horrible, but worst of all is that sometimes you see the characters talking but there's no talking or it's out of sync. Overall I am very disappointed with this movie. Not to mention that even though the movie was prime eligible, it came a week later! Wish I had bought the VHS version instead.",1379462400,2,547,4.768421052631579
83480,3,0788802194,"I wasn't able to watch ""The Making of Cinderella"" on the second disc. But I did get to watch the actual movie. I got my Cinderella fix LOL. I do wish I was able to watch the second disc though. :(",1379462400,,196,3.8048780487804876
83481,5,0788802194,"I love to collect movies. Especially good movies!

This is the time old classic presented by Disney. The image is now crisper and clearer with better sound now that it is on Bluray.

As far as the movie itself, it is a great movie with a wonderful story.",1379030400,,254,4.270833333333333

83492,4,0788802194,My daughter is 2 years old and we cannot get her away from the TV screen when this movie is playing.  She likes all the regular cartoons available today.  It is nice to see her enjoy a great classic movie.  My wife loves it as well.,1378857600,,232,4.0

83494,4,0788802194,"Classic Disney.  A little too much unclear singing makes it difficult for modern children to appreciate.  The c;larity is acceptable, maybe they'll restore this print again.",1378512000,,173,5.615384615384615
83495,4,0788802194,My grandchildren love it and it wasn't too childish for me to watch with them. I recommend it for all children,1378339200,,110,4.285714285714286

83498,2,0788802194,Love the movie but the condition was not acceptable two places where the movie broke up into pixels and stopped. Had to restart it. I don't expect the containers to be perfect but i expect the movie to be ablr to be viewed.,1377907200,,223,4.209302325581396

83531,5,0788802194,"I bought this and watched it with my 4 year old granddaughter and it kept her attention for the whole film, which is saying a lot for her!  I let her take it home and they watch it all the time now.  I thought it was wide screen but it's not.  Apparently FULL SCREEN just means that it fills in the screen top to bottom, but not on the sides like a wide screen does.  But still very much enjoyed by all.",1376956800,,403,3.8780487804878048
83532,5,0788802194,"A classic Disney film. I had the movie on VHS. But recently got it for my kids on Blu-Ray, after our trip to Disney World. They wanted to see all of the classic films, they had not really seen.",1376956800,,193,3.9743589743589745

83534,1,0788802194,"The movie has a skip in it where it stops playing on the regular dvd, the bluray DVD works fine
The regular one is the one that plays in car DVD player",1376611200,,151,3.75
83535,5,0788802194,Thought my grand boys would think this movie is for girls.  They giggled with all the antics of the mice and the cat.  A true classic.,1376438400,,134,4.115384615384615
83536,5,0788802194,"Disney Studios return to the full length animated feature film comes with their 12th effort Cinderella. Disney probably would have quit making these film if this wasn't a success. Fortunately is was and for a very good reason, it is one of their most beloved and impressive works to date. The return to the grand old fairy tale was a smart one and even though Walt had this idea in his ever busy mind for a long time, it took him nearly 20 years to make it happen, at least the version were are referring to here.

Cinderella gets the grand treatment here and looks almost too good to believe. I know purest say that the drawings were altered, but I saw no such tampering on this Blu Ray. OK, it is quite clean and grain is barely seen if at all, but the animation appears to be right, no lines missing maybe just lightened up from cleaning. I can't believe what some will complain about, this film looks spectacular and if you can't handle change, stick to your old film projectors.

The extras are very good, but  of course we have the exclusions from previous releases yet again, overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple, the characters and songs are memorable. It's no wonder this is a fan favorite.

If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.",1376438400,,1300,4.404166666666667
83537,5,0788802194,It's always a great movie.  It's a great first Disney movie to watch for a 3 year old because it doesn't really have 'bad guys' or scary witches. It's pleasant and happy with adorable mice and lots of magic.  The Bibbity Bobbity Boo scene is THE BEST!,1376265600,,251,4.319148936170213

83683,3,0788802194,"I really did enjoy this movie when I was a child. It was great at such
a young idea to believe in love at first sight. I also enjoyed the
ideal that a girl who was worthless and nothing could become someone
amazing and marry the perfect man.

I didn't enjoy her singing voice, though. I thought the vocal actress
for singing was too high, my ears are sensitive and high soprano
doesn't float my boat.

I kind of enjoyed the second Cinderella more, it was probably because I
was overwhelmed by the original story.

When I was young I read the Grimms version, with the cut off of parts
of the step sister's feet to wear the shoes, and all the other gore,
but Disney did a good job of making it nice. I preferred Dark though :P",1372550400,,724,4.194244604316546

83723,1,0788802194,"According to the article, ""Children's Culture and Disney's Animated Films,"" Henry Giroux argues, along with Jane Gallop's ""Close Reading,"" that Disney films are not for little children.  Taking the movie Cinderella for example, Cinderella and Prince Charming represent the ideal male and female roles of the 1920s.  Cinderella is cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, whereas Prince is ruling a kingdom, and saving the damsel in distress.  Why do we always need a male to save a women?  Why couldn't Cinderella have grown independent? Diving deeper in the film, Cinderella provides the logic to little girls that if all she does is sits around pouting a fairy godmother will come and save the day.  How so?  Fairy Godmothers are NOT real.  This is the real world in which nothing gets handed to you, you need to earn your way through life.  Again, why are we letting little children watch this?",1371859200,,890,4.966216216216216

83729,1,0788802194,"There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.

If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?

I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.

So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?

Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.",1370822400,2,1208,4.355555555555555

It might be a decade or two before you get another chance.  Yes it's a marketing ploy, but it works.  That's why Disney continues to do it.

We here have been watching the video VHS version nearly daily for months as it is one of my youngest daughter's favorite and I can tell you completely confidently that the hair is the exact same color.  The other review indicated that she would be blonder as in more yellowish in color but her hair remains in orangey gold.  Thebwhole picture is just much brighter and clearer but the color is not changes just enhance and it looks really really beautiful- the whole movie was gorgeous.

85037,5,0788802194,"One of the many benefits of blu-ray movies is that studios, knowing these will be the most pristine versions of their films, make the effort to insure that they are of the highest quality when it comes to how they look. One studio that has done this in spades is Disney. Their blu-ray and Diamond Editions are well worth the cost. And now they're releasing one of the classics to the Diamond Edition fold, CINDERELLA.

Made in 1950, CINDERELLA became a Disney staple when it comes to fairy princesses. If you don't believe me check out their toy lines which have always included this character. It was also a return for Disney to the classic animated films he had been known for at the time. The artwork involved, the painstaking hand drawn detail and the beauty of the film are seen in every frame.

For those completely unaware the story revolves around a young girl named Cinderella whose widowed father marries to insure that his daughter will have a woman in the house to help raise her. In doing so she also finds two step sisters as well. Unfortunately her father passes away and the inheritance he left behind was squandered on the two step sisters. Cinderella has since become a handmaiden and work horse in the home she was raised in receiving nothing but grief from her hateful step-siblings and evil step-mother. Her only friends are the animals of the house: birds, mice and the loyal dog.

Word is sent out by the King that he intends to have a Ball to celebrate the Prince's return home. In truth, he's hoping the Prince will find a bride and marry. Everyone is invited and Cinderella even plans on going until her step-mother prevents her going. Fortunately her dreams carry the day and her Fairy Godmother steps in using magic to whip up a coach, coachmen, footman, carriage and a beautiful dress for her to wear. The only stipulation is that she returns home by midnight.

She meets the Prince, falls in love and at the stroke of midnight runs to return home. Smitten with her the only connection the Prince has is a glass slipper that fell from her foot as she ran away. With only that slipper it is now up to the Grand Duke to find the Prince's bride to be and for them all to live happily ever after. That is unless the evil step-mother prevents it from happening.

It's the classic fairy tale from days gone by given the Disney touch here. That means cute little animals that assist Cinderella in everything from cleaning to making her a gown to wear to the Ball. The birds even wake her in the morning before anyone can ruin her day yelling. All of them are as nice as can be and the mice are adorable with each one having their own particular characteristics.

What makes Disney films so spectacular and why they have lasted so long is that they stuck to a formula that worked and continued to do so while Walt Disney was alive. They took classic tales and just altered them enough to make them their own. They used amazing artistic abilities to bring to life on screen what was once just the written word. They combined sight and sound with the brightest and most colorful visuals and some of the best songwriting available at that time.

That was then and this is now though. What the studio has done with their use of blu-ray technology is offer the most fantastic looking version of the film that you will find. With each re-release of a Disney classic, they use the most current technology to bring forth the original vision offered when the film was released and in some cases make it even more colorful. There has never been a studio that has made animated films that can come close to rivaling Disney. It shows here.

For fans one of the best things about this release is that it's coming out just in time for Christmas. I know that I've routinely asked for their new releases each Christmas and this one would be no exception. The price is never outrageous and the costs will pay itself off with countless viewings between older fans and new ones discovering the magic for the first time.

The sentimentalist in each of us that grew up with these Disney films will be touched once again with a more current viewing. You'll marvel at the beauty of the film, you'll be touched by the story and you'll find yourself reliving memories of when you saw the film for the first time. This is a film you won't want to miss. One word of warning, like most Disney classics they only release them for a limited time period so don't hesitate, get it today.

Other Disney titles are making their way just in time for the holidays as well. Want to know which ones? Then make sure to check Digital Views online.",1352764800,3,4628,4.505363528009535

Cinderella was created a long time, the 1950's, a long time before there was computer assisted animation.  It is still a magical movie.  This is a great movie that follows the fairy tale exactly with some extras, e.g. the dialog scenes of her fairy godmother which adds to the charm of the movie that isn't included in the fairy tale.

This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy.  It is a movie that charms you & you are drawn into it because of its charm.  You can tell right away who the good characters are & who the bad characters are.

85105,5,0788802194,"Cinderella represented a major gamble for Walt Disney. After producing inexpensive package films for the majority of the 1940s, the studio needed a hit to be able to return to producing full length animated films. Fortunately, Cinderella not only was a major hit but has become one of Disney's top classics. With the perfect blend of comedy, catchy songs, drama and great characters, Cinderella is the perfect Disney formula.

Most of you already know the story but here's a brief synopsis: Cinderella is a girl that is forced to live as a servant in her own house after her father dead. Her evil stepmother and stepsisters forced her to do all type of hard chores and she hardly has time for anything. But, when the king announces that he will organize a ball in honor of his son the Prince so he can find a suitable wife, Cinderella and her stepsisters are eager to attend. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother does everything in her power to prevent her from going but with a little bit of help from her friends the mice and a kind fairy godmother, she meets the prince and he falls in love with her. Of course, the Fairy's spell only lasts until midnight and she escapes before the spell is broken. The only trace that she leaves behind is a glass slipper and the Prince begins a search throughout the whole kingdom to find her again.

As you can see, the plot is pretty straightforward but what makes Cinderella a classic is the execution. Walt was a master storyteller and this film is a testament of those skills. The story keeps you invested the whole time and every element falls into place to create a magical film that keeps being as delightful now as it was in 1950 when it premiered.

Video & Audio

Cinderella looks wonderful on BD. As part of the Diamond line, the movie was given a major overhaul and the results are pretty great. An element of contention is the fact that all the grain has been scrubbed out of the film. The final image is spotless but this fact might make some purists groan in discontent. Anyway, aside from that debatable point, everything else in the image, color, detail, contrast, etc is excellent. There are no signs of damage whatsoever. A stellar picture.

Audio comes in the form of a 7.1 DTS-HD MA which is absolutely wonderful and compliments the picture in a perfect way. For purists, the is a 1.0 DTS HD MA that delivers a more faithful but still excellent audio mix.

Bonus Material

Unfortunately, the new material created for this release is not very substantial but some pieces are nice and the carry overs from the previous DVD release are all excellent. Here's what's included:

""Diane Disney Miller Introduction"" is the now standard introduction by Walt's daughter. Is always nice to watch her introducing these classics.
""Cinderella Alternate Opening Sequence"" is a newly found deleted opening for the film. I have to say that the film's opening is better but the inclusion of this deleted scene is worthy.
Three new featurettes are housed under the ""Backstage Disney: Diamond Edition"" section. The first and the best is ""The Real Fairy Godmother"" which is a touching homage to Mary Alice, a woman that devoted her life to helping others and also served as the inspiration for Cinderella's fairy Godmother. The next featurette is ""Behind the Magic: A New Disney Princess Fantasyland"" which is hosted by Once Upon a Time's Ginnifer Goodwin and shows us the process of creation of the new ride in DisneyWorld. The third and most silly of the three is ""The Magic of a Glass Slipper: A Cinderella Story"" which is a french short featuring famed shoe designer Christian Louboutin.
""Tangled Ever After"" is a delightful short featuring the characters from 2010's Tangled.
""Personalized Digital Storybook: Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You"" is a Second Screen Application.
""DisneyView"" is the option to watch the film with side art.
""Classic DVD Bonus Features"" is where the majority and best bonus material is. Making-of documentaries, galleries, trailers, audio excerpts, retrospectives, deleted scenes and more makes this section an essential viewing.

A DVD copy is included.

Closing Thoughts

Cinderella may not seem as ambitious as other Disney classics but it can't be disputed is one. Is the perfect blend of Disney formula and the result is spectacular. This new BD release offers stellar picture & sound and while new better bonus material would have been appreciated, everything that's included is great and informative. Cinderella is a Disney classic and a must own release.",1351123200,,4518,4.877444589308996

85129,5,0788802194,"This digital restoration looks amazing, and the sound is great.  The special features were a very nice touch.  I highly recommend this for any Disney fan.",1350086400,,154,4.884615384615385
85130,4,0788802194,"The beginning narration accompanies charming water-color pictures: ""Once upon a time, in a far away land, there was a tiny kingdom, peaceful, prosperous and rich in romance and tradition. Here in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella. Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still, he felt she needed a mother's care. And so he married again.""

Poor Cinderella. When her father dies young, her Stepmother shows her true colors, and Cinderella becomes a servant in her own house.

""Cinderella"" is one of the stories that is truly ""Once upon a time"" and ""Happily Ever After"". It's also one where the males in the story are almost after-thoughts. The Prince is generic and forgettable. The King and Grand Duke are more interesting (and have more story-time), but they, too, are not central characters.

No, it's the sweet-natured heroine and the dastardly stepmother and imbecilic stepsisters who run the show. And Cinderella's animal friends are important to the plot, too. Or, at least they try to be. The first third of the movie is a little slow-going, made up of several scenes of Cinderella interacting with her animal friends.

There is plenty of humor, and not just with the animals. I particularly like this exchange between the King and the Grand Duke, the morning after the ball:
Grand Duke - ""The Prince, Sire, says he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper.""
King - ""Aha! We've GOT him!""
Grand Duke - ""But Sire, the shoe may fit any number of girls!""
King - ""That's his problem. He's given his word. We'll hold him to it!""

I am fond of Disney's 1950 ""Cinderella"", but it does not have as much striking graphic animation as earlier Disney movies. For example, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", 1937, had awesome scenes with the Huntsman and Snow White running through the woods. Or how about the ""Pinocchio"" scene where Pinocchio and other boys start turning into donkeys on Pleasure Island. And 1940 ""Fantasia"" had ""A Night on Bald Mountain"".

Except for the wonderful scene where Cinderella goes into her Stepmother's bedroom, and the dim morning light creates a shadow pattern on her, standing reluctantly against the bedroom doors, the ""Cinderella"" animation is more pedestrian, like storybook illustrations.

And except for the Fairy Godmother's ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" song, the music in ""Cinderella"" isn't as memorable as earlier movies, either. (Or later movies, for that matter.)

This is a review of the 2-disc Diamond Edition of ""Cinderella"". Both the DVD and Blu-Ray in this Diamond Edition feature Digitally restored picture and sound. The colors are great, but the animation spark isn't. The movie can be listened to in English, French and Spanish. Subtitles are available in French and Spanish.

Bonus Features are a little different for the Blu-Ray and DVD:
1. Both DVD and Blu-Ray - ""Tangled Ever After"" This animated short shows us how the preparations go (and don't go) for the wedding of Rapunzel and Flynn (first seen in the 2010 movie ""Tangled"").
2. Blu-Ray only - ""Never Before Seen Alternate Opening Sequence"" This sequence is in the form of draft drawings (no color), where Cinderella, in rhyme, tells her animal friends about her day.
3. Blu-Ray only - ""Personalized Digital Storybook: Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You - A Disney Second Screen Experience"". If you download an app, you can play short games and do simple activities (such as ""Create a Gown for Cinderella"") on an iphone, ipad or laptop. Geared for young children.
4. Both Blu-Ray and DVD - ""Behind the Magic: A New Disney Princess Fantasyland at Walt Disney World"". an ad
5. Blu-Ray only - ""The Real Fairygodmother"". A short about Mary O'Connor. She was the wife of long-time Disney artist, Ken O'Connor, and is remembered for her many acts of kindness and generosity.
6. Blu-Ray only - Two Deleted Scenes: ""The Cinderella Work Song"" and ""Dancing on a Cloud""
7. DVD only - ""Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go"" an ad
8. DVD only - ""Discover Blu-Ray 3D with Timon & Pumba"" an ad

This is a review of the 2-disc ""Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-Ray Packaging"". The amazon page when I purchased the set and currently clearly states: ""Format: Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen"". I rate the movie 4 stars, except that the inaccurate amazon page and the mediocre Bonus Features could take it down to 2.8 stars.

The Diamond Edition DVD of ""Cinderella"" is definitely not widescreen. After I watched my DVD, I looked around on-line. It appears that ""Cinderella"" has never been produced in widescreen for public purchase. Given that movie theater screens are NOT 1.37:1 or 1.33:1, and ""Cinderella"" was a theater release, maybe this means that Disney never kept a theatrical version of the movie. In any case, I've run into several problems with amazon page descriptions that are off the mark.

If you have a standard TV this will cause the video to playback in a small square in the middle of your tv. It won't even take up the whole screen. They didn't make it anamorphic fillscreen for some reason and I refuse to watch a tiny box that doesnt even take up half the TV screen.

First the disks are very cheeply made not like the previous versions with a nice label of the movie with a character and the aspect ratio is very confusing.  I want to watch this movie in either wide screen or full and not in a box.  It looks like the movie is being seen through a computer monitor.

Every thing else about this release is wonderful. It looks beautiful - works with my Panny 7.1 surround, and brings back memories from years ago when this was only available on VHS - we played our VHS out until the audio was weak and the picture was fuzzy.

However I was a bit disappointed with the new trend Disney is doing with their releases to blue ray. instead of giving bonus content that is new from this release, they are recycling bonus content from when it was released on DVD. I have the film on DVD and was surprised that they only chose to add 5 bonus features/documentaries. I have to say I was expecting a bit more out of the special edition.

The film was cleaned up and colors are more vibrant than ever.",1349740800,,538,4.37
85137,5,0788802194,"What's the most nightmarishly terrifying scene in movie history? The shower scene in Psycho? Sure. Tippi and those pesky birds? Maybe. Moviedom's got an endless parade of horrors, most of them supernatural, many of the inhuman sort.

But I would venture that few movie viilains can quite match the level of abject cruelty contained in what is also one of the most beloved family classics of all time. It's that scene in Cinderella, in which the stepmother incites the stepsisters into ripping Cinderella's dress to shreds -- while she's wearing it. Moments earlier, we saw her all happy in anticipation of going to the royal ball and perhaps being treated more as a peer by her family.

Am I overdramatizing? Perhaps. But the story of Cinderella is eternal because so many of us identify with her. We've been in situations that allow others to inflict cruelty on us. Call it bullying, call it abuse, physical or mental. What Walt Disney's Cinderella did was to take a bare bones story and make us worry that it might not end happily, even though we know full well that it does. Walt Disney and his amazing artists did it by making the characters seem so real, this familiar fairy tale becomes downright riveting.

As a character, Cinderella is extraordinarily likable, a feat that cannot be said of all Disney animated feature lead characters. Usually we identify with the sidekicks -- and the Disney version has lots of them in the form of compassionate mice -- but in this film, they only reinforce our kinship with the leading lady.

As a film, Cinderella was crucial in reviving the Disney studio's postwar doldrums, so much so that its creators did as much as possible to assure its success, even to cutting the live-action model footage to match exactly what the animators had to produce, with little wiggle room (except for Ward Kimball, who apparently had relatively free rein with the mice and Lucifer, the cat).

Speaking of Lucifer, the meows and shrieks were provided by the radiant June Foray in her feature film debut. She just turned 95 last month.

The voice cast benefits also from Lucille Bliss as Anastasia (she was also Smurfette on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon), and Rhoda Williams as the stepsisters, Eleanor Audley as the stepmother (who also played Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty and Madame Leota in The Haunted Mansion attraction), Verna Felton as the Fairy Godmother (also the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland and star of TV's December Bride among countless others) and even narration by Betty Lou Gerson (Cruella DeVil in 101 Dalmatians).

85148,5,0788802194,"Cinderella is one of the classics, and it's great that it's finally available on Blu-ray.

Ignore the reviews of those whining that this is not presented in 16 x 9.  That's because it wasn't made that way!  Go back to a ton of other moves of the era - they were also made in 1.33

Disney has been doing a GREAT job with restoring and presenting their classics on Blu-ray, and I for one am THRILLED that they preserve the original aspect ratio.  If I want to watch something in 16 x 9, I'll watch a current movie.  If I want to watch a beloved classic, I want to see it the way I remember it, and the way it was originally presented.

Very happy to have this in my collection alongside other great Disney classics on Blu-ray.",1349654400,8,724,4.202898550724638

Beyond disappointed.  If you are an audiofile, you'll be disappointed as well.  At least my DVD puts it into 16:9.

Have to give it 2 stars because it does look spectacular though.  The only positive.  Could care less about 7.1...it's not Jurassic Park.  7.1 on Cinderella is pointless.",1349654400,,496,4.362637362637362

85151,4,0788802194,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment brings their most famous princess to Blu-ray with the ""Cinderella"" Diamond Edition. When people talk about Disney Princesses, Cinderella is the first one that comes to mind. Although it's obviously targeted to a female audience, there's enough humor found in the antics of the mice, the cat Lucifer, the Prince's father, and his assistant to keep male audiences at least mildly entertained for the movie's 75-minute runtime. This is an exceptional fairy tale film, although a true element of evil like a witch or a sorceress who can turn herself into a dragon is sorely missed. Evil stepmothers just don't hold the same peril for me as something supernatural.

After her father dies, Cinderella is left to the mercy of her stepmother. The wicked lady puts her stepdaughter to work as a servant. She cooks and cleans after the vile stepmother and her two daughters with a constant fear of being cast out of her own home. The Prince of Cinderella's homeland puts on a ball to find a wife. He demands the attendance of all the maids in the kingdom and the poor girl sees an opportunity for a temporary escape from her miserable day-to-day routine. Unfortunately, the depraved stepmother and her daughters have plans to keep Cinderella from attending the ball and meeting the Prince.

The high definition transfer of ""Cinderella"" is dazzling. It appears as if every frame in the film was individually cleaned up and restored. You can see the difference between the hand-drawn animation quality of these early films from the 1950s and that of the ones from the 1970s. The movement of the characters appear smoother for one thing.

The restored original theatrical soundtrack is brought to the forefront as a result of the movie's 7.1 surround sound upgrade. You'd never know this movie is over 50-years old from experiencing it here. The audio is just as full and breathtaking as any movie made today.

Disney collectors will be delighted with the bonus material for this new edition. There's a never-before-seen alternate opening sequence and three deleted scenes included. It also contains the ""Tangled Ever After"" short, a personalized digital storybook entitled ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You,"" and three featurettes including ""Behind the Magic: A New Disney Princess Fairyland"" ""The Magic of a Glass Slipper: A Cinderella Story,"" and ""The Real Fairy Godmother."" Extra features from the 2005 Special Edition DVD are found as well.

The 2-Disc Blu-ray / DVD ""Cinderella"" Diamond Edition Combo Pack is what every Disney Princess enthusiast has been waiting for. It's the ultimate edition of the classic for those upgrading their home theater libraries to the latest high-definition format. Consumers won't be disappointed with its extraordinary enhanced picture and audio and abundance of engaging special features.",1349654400,,2833,5.190371991247265

TANGLED EVER AFTER is a must see and highly recommended",1349308800,,478,4.150537634408602
85155,5,0788802194,"I had forgotten what a gem ""Cinderella"" was until I watched it on the new Blu-ray disc that was just released. The restoration makes it look as if you can see the original art of the characters and the background...it's that clean! The backgrounds themselves are works of art, especially in the scene where Cinderella goes to the backyard garden and meets her fairy godmother. The talent of Mary Blair is evident in the styling, and I have never seen it with such clarity as on the new blu-ray release. The sound is crisp and clear, free of extraneous noise, and the voice of Ilene Woods (Cinderella) has never sounded so lovely. If you are unfamiliar with the story, here's the short version: the death of Cinderella's devoted father leaves her at the mercy of her wicked stepmother, Lady Tremaine. Forced to clean the mansion and dote on Tremaine's bratty daughters, Drizella & Anastasia, Cinderella keeps her spirits up with her positive attitude and the friendships she has developed with the mice that adore her. When the local Prince must find a wife at an upcoming Royal Ball, Cinderella sees an opportunity for happiness. However, the selfish Tremaine Trio has other ideas for her. You'll just have to watch this Disney animated classic to see how it all turns out.

Cinderella was a unique Disney heroine. Unlike Snow White, Cinderella seems more true-to-life. Thanks to the warmth of Ilene Woods' voice, Cinderella has a maturity and depth that Snow White was missing. Sure, Cinderella has a positive attitude, but you also sense her weariness with the situation of servitude that she is forced to endure with the Tremaines. When her stepsisters seemingly ruin all chances of her making it to the Royal Ball, her breakdown is so convincingly voiced and animated that it would be hard not to shed a tear or two and feel genuine sympathy for this model heroine. Just as effective are the vocals of Eleanor Audley, whose chilling restraint for Lady Tremaine makes her one of the best Disney villains.

Extras:

Tangled Ever After animated short: a short little piece of fluff, which shows the wedding of Rapunzel, but focuses on the mishap of how the ring is temporarily lost and must be retrieved for the ceremony. Cute.

Behind The Magic: A New Disney Princess Fantasyland: ""Once Upon A Time""'s Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White) leads a tour of the ""new"" Fantasyland construction at Walt Disney World. Still in progress, Goodwin walks around the construction site while viewers get to see computer renderings of what will eventually be there.

Diane Disney Miller intro: Very short, this basically amounts to a plug for the Disney Museum in San Francisco.

Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You! Personalized Digital Storybook  (A Disney Second Screen experience)

The Magic Of The Glass Slipper: A Cinderella Story: Another fun piece of fluff, it is a short that shows how Christian Louboutin designed a shoe that was his interpretation of the glass slipper. This short is more of a fantasy, and seems to have its visual styling based on Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" (even using the same typeface, Windsor, for its titles).

The Real Fairy Godmother ? The incredible true story of Mary Alice O'Connor: I loved this featurette! Disney layout artist Ken O'Connor used his wife as the inspiration for the look of Cinderella's Fairy Godmother. This short tells how Mary Alice was such a giving person, volunteering for so many worthwhile charities and being such an uplifting and caring soul to boot. You really get the sense of warmth that this woman left behind.

Alternate Opening Sequence: Storyboard sketches show an alternate opening. The one used in the final film is much better!

Plus classic DVD bonus features, which are pretty extensive! They include deleted musical numbers, a ""Making of"" (38:27 minutes long) feature (did you know talk host show legend Mike Douglas was the voice of Prince Charming?), and a fantastic short about the talented Mary Blair. This is one of the best (albeit short at 14:58) tributes to Mary Blair, who was greatly admired by Walt Disney. He had a hard time finding a place for her to display her talents until it came time for the ""it's a small world"" exhibit came to be for the New York World's Fair in 1965. There is also a 1922 Laugh-O-Gram Disney silent film version of ""Cinderella"" (which really shows how Walt's filmmaking abilities matured over the years!) as well as a Mickey Mouse Club Show excerpt with Helene Stanley, who was the model for the live-action reference footage shot for ""Cinderella."" 3 vintage radio programs with Ilene Woods are included as well as a featurette titled: ""From Walt's Table: A Tribute to the Nine Old Men."" Present day Disney animators talk about the 9 Old Men and what each one meant to them while they are at the Tam O'Shanter restaurant, a famous hangout for Disney animators. Hosted by the late Joel Siegel. You can also see a Storyboard-to-Film Comparison (6:59) of the opening sequence, plus the usual collection of theatrical trailers.

Not very well known today is that ""Cinderella"" was a crucial film to the future success of The Disney Studio. At that time, ""Snow White"" had been the only truly profitable feature that Disney has released; a lot was riding on the success of ""Cinderella."" Fortunately, ""Cinderella"" was a blockbuster hit and allowed the Disney Studio to continue creating animated classics.

85156,5,0788802194,"I had this title on my wish list but it so happened that it was released earlier in my country, and so I got it last week.

I must hand it to the Disney people: this is by far the best looking, well restored picture quality that I have seen in the last years in this hobby.

I have had Cinderella in various formats, including Laserdisc and DVD. The picture in the Blu-Ray disc is so good that one can perceive the original design with unprecedented precision. Colour rendition is also superb. In this regard, I met an American scientist from Varian a few years ago (sadly I do not recall his name) who was doing a colorimetric analysis for Disney, in order to restore their animation work. The analysis was necessary because the studio used hand made painting colours, manufactured with natural dyes. However, today the same analysis is done within the digital media, and it seems extremely accurate.

Sound wise, restoration is effective but not to a point to sustain full high fidelity. In fact, I noticed some audible distortion in the sound track at the beginning of the picture, luckily nothing that would offend anybody's ears. By the sound of it, I believe that optical recording was still being made at the studio, and that may very well explain the overall low quality sound of the entire movie. And since Cinderella was originally released in mono, the Blu-Ray includes a 7.1 soundtrack with sparse front stage stereo and one single surround effect that I could notice.

As for the movie, until today I rank Cinderella as one of the best animation features ever made. It has cinematic virtues, fantasy, beauty, and suspense, derived from a very short fairytale story. Suffice to say that some of the premises in Cinderella for the tale of a bullied heiress who was victimised by the death of her father and later succumbed by her stepmother wicked domination is greatly and competently extrapolated by pertinent sub-themes such as transformation and miracles, in order to release her from her emotional misery.

For fans of animation or Disney film in particular, I could not have any more words to recommend this disc. This is, in my opinion, a must have release of Cinderella, perhaps the one to keep as the definitive home video version.",1349222400,2,2251,4.7615384615384615

In watching this, I have to say that they have come so far since the VHS tape version of this movie that we still have. The digital quality on this Diamond edition was amazing, and the movie itself just explodes from the screen (let alone the sound that you get as well).

On top of this, you also get an amazing array of bonus features on this that allow you to go behind the scenes to see some things that have not been released in the past and some that have, but that were still great to view again. I loved the Tangled short that was included on this as it was definitely one that was worth watching over and over again.

All-in-all this was a definite upgrade for my family in regards to quality and my girls simply adored watching the movie again and even they reacted (at least my oldest did) about how great it sounded.

So we tried purchasing another one (from a different Amazon seller), but this one also turned out to be defective.  So we got rid of our Insignia player and purchased a new Panasonic player.  Both discs fail to play in the new player.  The video is garbled throughout substantial portions of each of the discs (though in different locations).  I give up. Where's the manufacturing quality control for these Disney discs?  It seems very odd for this to be a mere coincidence.  Can't blame the sellers.

85413,1,0788802194,"I purchased several movies from this vendor, last year when I was in the Army...big mistake. Each movie that I purchased claimed to be ""brand new"" and ""factory sealed"" bull...I got them, and noticed that the artwork on the box (as well as the pamphlet inside, and even the art on the discs) seemed a little...dark and grainy. Like it had been printed off of regular printer paper. I must've been right, because Cinderella won't even play. When I try to play it, it just has some wierd screen that i've never seen before, that to me looks like it was a copied disc that got messed up...I thoroughly believe that every disc this vendor sells (at least the ones I got) are bootleg copies. I do not suggest purchasing from them...spend a little more and buy from an honest vendor.

Some of the grainy feeling and undertone sounds that were there when I saw it as a child added to the magic of the movie, to the enchantment of it. It felt more alive, more dynamic -- which is part of that whole old Disney way of doing things. Now that it has been cleaned up and brightened, it is abrasive and boring. They made it look like that horrible for-video sequel, so modern and cold. It's a shame. Sometimes old movies need to be left with their own texture from their own time.

85458,4,0788802194,"With a story as familiar as this one, the challenge lies in expanding upon the original, adding exposition or new angles to make it memorable, and this Disney does.  Of course everyone knows the basic story (which, interestingly, is found in cultures ranging from China to Native America to Europe and back again): Cinderella's widowed father remarries, then dies, leaving her in the power of a tyrannical stepmother and two homely stepsisters who force her to become a servant in her own house; when the royal family invites all eligible young women of good family to a ball in honor of the prince, Cinderella's fairy godmother provides her with a coach, horses, driver, and gown, and she and the prince fall in love, only to be separated when the spell breaks at midnight; the prince searches for her using the only clue he has, a dainty glass slipper that fell off her foot as she fled; he finds her and ""they live happily ever after.""  The Disney genius here lies in humanizing the stepmother and -sisters and exposing the goodness of Cinderella's character by her interaction with the animals who love and trust her: her best (if not only) friends are an old horse and hound who probably served her father, the mice that live in the walls, and the birds that nest under the eaves of her bedroom.  They all come through for her too: when her stepmother schemes to keep her so overwhelmed with work that she can't finish modernizing her mother's old ball gown, the lady mice take over and do the job for her; later ""the men""--Bruno the hound, the old horse, Jacques the boss mouse and some of his friends--are transformed to horses, coachman, and footman by the Godmother's magic.  The stepmother (splendidly voiced by character actress Eleanor Audley) is both a ""fine lady"" and an ambitious tyrant, though her daughters Anastasia and Drusilla are almost caricatures.  The prince is something of a nonentity--he doesn't have more than a few dozen words of dialogue--which makes the ""love-at-first-sight"" motif a bit hard to swallow, but his father the King (a bluff old tyrant who's determined to see his grandchildren before he dies) and the King's trusted advisor the Grand Duke (who takes over the search for the girl whose foot will fit the slipper) are a delight.  And at the end Jacques and his friend Gus must race against time to release Cinderella from captivity in the tower before the Duke gives up on the house and leaves.  With trademark excellent animation and a pleasant musical score, this is a classic of its kind.",1292284800,,2534,4.771689497716895

There was no pay off for them in the end....no comeuppance.  Disappointing.  The prince was also incidental.  This is one of Disney's mediocre efforts because of the poor writing.  The animation and songs are lovely.  But if you want to watch Cinderella, watch Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1965 version starring Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon.

85559,3,0788802194,"For Me, The Disney companies great films were all made during Walt Disneys life, and the 7 finest of them all seemed to define a specific type of love. The first, for me, is Pinnochio, which is about a fathers love. Dumbo is about love between mother & child. Bambi is love of nature, Mother dies, Father takes over, but all of nature helps Bambi come of age,  I think this might have been Walt Disneys favorite, its mine). Peter Pan is about how an orphan gets love. Lady & the Tramp is romantic love, between boyfriend & girlfriend. !01 Dalmatians is love of the entire family, family love. Mary Poppins is the love a child feels for a guardian when the childs parents are too busy for it. All in all, those films cover all the bases pretty much. Any baby-boomer worth his salt couldn't help but be carried away by the feelings produced by any of those magic films.
  But then there were Disneys other movies, those annoying things where teapots sang, naughty housecats snickered & plotted evil deeds on the nice little mice, elderly fairy mothers came in threes & were not anything like the one we met in Pinnochio, it was all so cute it could make you barf, and it wasn't about love anymore, it was only an excuse to burst in to song about the joy of being like everyone else is, ordinary. Alice in wonderland was a vulgar tasteless joke beside the classic poetry of Lewis Carroll. Cinderrala, Sleeping Beauty- none of these came close to capturing the magic of those other timeless films. I find it difficult to believe even that Walt had much to do with those movies, he was busy with Disneyland & its construction at the time I think. And the anamated films that Disney has come out with since his death, Beauty & Beast, Little Mermaid, whetever, all feel like those films of the second type.",1275523200,,1799,4.478658536585366

It is absolutely sparkling, glittery, magical fun. This movie holds up so well... we enjoy it over and again and it never occurs to me (or my children) that it is well over 50 years old. The story is timeless, the music is charming and we're absolutely wild about Jaq and Gus!

Otherwise, I was unimprssed with the bonus music, etc. But then, bonus features for older movies are rarely terrific because the original cast / staff is typically unavailable for interview.",1222992000,,721,4.861788617886178

When my daughter actually got to meet Cinderella, to hug her and to talk to her, she was quite literally quivering.  I truly thought she might faint from the excitement.  It was her dream come true.

Disney's classic masterpiece brings Cinderella's story to life, in full, rich, beautiful color, with familiar, catchy, adored songs, and gorgeous, detailed, vivid animation.  This tale is endearing to princesses of all ages, young and old alike.  We watch Disney's CINDERELLA several times a week in our house, and every time, my daughter watches straight through from beginning to end, completely enchanted.  Heck, I am still completely enchanted, even after all these years.  It is lovely, charming, sweet, and happy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all princesses everywhere.",1219449600,3,1080,5.184971098265896

There's a mini documentary about the process Walt Disney went through developing Cinderella over a surprisingly long period of time. There are music videos made from storyboards for two deleted songs and demo recordings of half a dozen more. Random Disney Channel stars butcher ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"". There's a very Disney Princess music video made up clips from all the princess movies and that's pretty good.

She even pretends to tell Anastasia and Drizella that they are not nice for the way they treat Cinderella in her play.  (She used to adamantly tell that to them when they came on screen.)

85832,5,0788802194,"Cinderella is probably the most overdone fairytale in the history of the world.  It is the ultimate dream, a young destitute woman rises from the ashes of her existence (pun intended) to become a princess.  Every young girl dreams of becoming a princess of having a prince sweep her off of her feet, and that is what makes Cinderella stand the test of time.

  This story is of course about a young girl names Cinderella.  Her father dies and she is left behind with her cruel and jealous stepmother.  A woman who gets pleasure out of making Cinderella's life a living hell.  She makes her clean everything over and over even when it is already spotless.  She sleeps in the highest tower and her only friends are some precocious mice, a mopey dog, and cute birds. Of course Cinderella is perennially optimistic except when her chances of going to the princes ball is ruined, which of course is is saved by....  I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it.

  As far as stories goes, it is a classic, and this is a very well-done and well-executed version of the tale.  The only problem I have with this (the same problem I have with most Disney movies) is how vain it is.  Love is basically just ""Oh... He is so handsome... I love him!""  As far as depth goes, you are much better off watching ""Everafter"" or reading ""Ella Enchanted"" (do not watch the movie).  However, if you want a geourgeously adapted film and a fun family friendly movie, then hands down Disney's Cinderella wins every time.

  The animation in this film is amazing, and it transferred beautifully onto DVD.  It has to be one of Disney's prettiest movies along with ""Sleeping Beauty"".  If you are looking for depth, go elsewhere, but if you want a fun and enchanting film that you can watch over and over again with amazing music, then watch the Disney version  of Cinderella.

While the movie was a hit amongst its target audience in my estimation it didn't display any vast improvement over the earlier film. The animation was much the same, the characters continued to be one-dimensional, the villainess didn't match the intensity of evil as the previous and while the soundtrack was quite good the songs weren't as memorable as those in Snow White.

`Cinderella' does however have its moments, the best being those featuring her two little mouse friends and helpers Jaques and Gus. For me Gus-Gus saves this film and makes it enjoyable for an adult audience.

Not Disney's best but as all Disney features go, it has its own loyal audience which I'm sure runs in the millions.",1175817600,,900,4.953642384105961

Of course, my daughter loves Cinderella, and my son belly laughs at the mice and animal antics. One caveat -- every princess movie contains at least one scene where the princess runs to her room, throws herself down, and sobs. Be prepared for your little girls to reenact these scenes. :)",1175299200,,391,4.52112676056338
85869,5,0788802194,"When this first came out I hesitated to buy it - I didn't remember loving the movie when I was younger and didn't feel any particular need to have it. Having watched it now, however, as well as the entire second disc, I believe this is the most comprehensive and enjoyable Platinum Edition DVD Disney has ever released.

The movie itself was more engaging than I remembered, moving at a satisfying pace (a major concern for Walt, discussed in the Making Of bonus segment). Color and sound are improved - and yes, the aspect ratio is preserved in its original full-screen format.

Disc 2, though, is the real treasure - a rich collection of bonus features. One of the most enjoyable is a round-table discussion among current Disney artists and execs on Walt Disney's historical ""Nine Old Men,"" the team of animators largely responsible for such pioneering movies as Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, Bambi, and others. During the conversation we learn about the evolution of animation as an art form, the revolutionary techniques developed at Disney, as well as a personal glimpse at each artist's background as well as their classic characters and scenes (including, in Cinderella, who animated the great, sophisticated facial expression on Cinderella as she receives the invitation and laughingly says, ""perhaps I should interrupt the ... 'music' ... lesson""). We're also treated to some wonderful galleries, including concept art for the Cinderella-Prince dance sequence, which was originally envisioned as a dance in the stars.

This is a great presentation of a classic film which has aged gracefully, as well as some unique and insightful archival footage and storyboards. Recommended for anyone who enjoys Disney.",1174780800,,1737,5.174377224199288

As most Disney movies tend to do, it shows that goodness and caring about others prevails over vanity and meanness.

85902,5,0788802194,"Cinderella is the classic fairytale about a sweet and beautiful young girl who grows up like a servant in her own home after her kind father dies and her stepmother squanders his money on her own spoiled daughters. However, Cinderella does her best to keep everyone happy, toiling endlessly with only her animal friends to comfort and look out for her, and with unfaltering hope that someday her dreams of happiness will come true. Of course, this story has a handsome prince as well, and he has problems of his own. His father, the king, wants his son to be married immediately so that he can see his grandchildren before his time runs out. But the prince doesn't want to marry just anyone, so the king orders a ball to be held, and every eligible maiden in the kingdom is required to attend. Suddenly, Cinderella sees a chance for at least one night of happiness, but her wicked stepmother and ugly stepsisters keep her too busy to prepare for the event. Luckily, her mice friends help her out by fixing up her mother's old dress to be fit for the ball. Of course, that's not enough to thwart the vicious stepmother, and she craftily manipulates her daughters into destroying the dress. Enter the Fairy Godmother (where has she been for the past 10 years?), who, through one of Disney's most beloved and memorable songs (though this film has more than one), turns a pumpkin into a coach, mice into horses, a dog and a horse into a driver and footman, and Cinderella's rags into the most lovely gown there ever was, complete with slippers made of glass to fit Cinderella's remarkably tiny feet. Cinderella attends the ball and is too dolled up for her stepfamily to recognize, but she immediately catches the eye of the prince, and the two fall madly in love. When the clock strikes 12 though, the spell over Cinderella's dress, pumpkin, and friends is set to be broken, and she soon finds herself having to make a sudden run for her coach. Cinderella manages to escape the pursuing guards (she didn't even know it was the prince she had danced with), leaving only one of her glass slippers behind on the palace steps. With only that one clue to the woman of his dreams, the prince sends the Grand Duke on a search throughout the kingdom and promises to marry whomever the tiny glass slipper fits!

In 1950 (just before widescreen became the norm, hence the appropriate full-screen format on this DVD), Walt Disney Studios released one of their best loved animated features to this day, the romantic fairytale classic, ""Cinderella."" The film was a huge success, and it's well known that it single-handedly saved the studio after years of losing money making films for the war effort and entertaining but forgettable (to the non-Disney-fanatic, anyway) animated anthologies. One need only walk into a Disney Store, or almost any other store, to see how popular this 57 year old film still is. And it shouldn't be surprising, with it's wonderful characters, enchanting music, classic story, and some of Disney's greatest talents behind its production. Walt Disney backed his legendary group of animators, ""the 9 Old Men,"" with the whimsical style of artist Mary Blair and magical ""Tin Pan Alley"" songs to make an animated film that is often considered perfection. The animation, based at least in-part on live-action footage (almost the entire film was shot in live-action first, for reference), but with plenty of doses of imagination, is gorgeous, as is Cinderella herself; easily one of Disney's most beautiful and graceful princesses. Ilene Woods provides her heavenly voice, with Eleanor Audley voicing the sinister stepmother, Lady Tremaine, who is surely one of Disney's meanest baddies ever. In fact, I personally consider her far more intimidating than Cruella De Vil (who is wildly entertaining, but I always thought was more humorous than scary). Verna Felton is entirely lovable as the Fairy Godmother, and the rarely seen Prince Charming is voiced by William Phipps and Mike Douglas (singing voice). It's important to note that Prince Charming is rarely seen, as this film has been billed as ""The greatest love story ever told."" Yes, it's got that feeling, it definitely is a ""romantic"" picture, but the story itself is really more about perseverance, kindness, fortitude, loyalty, understanding, humility, hope, faith, courage, confidence, self-respect, determination, inner-beauty, and all those other character traits that make the Cinderella character popular folklore's ideal woman. The film doesn't go light on the comic relief, of course, not with the King and Grand Duke, Cinderella's bratty stepsisters, and some of the most memorable ""animal sidekicks"" in animation history, but the cat and mouse games usually do progress the story, as do the magical songs that are some of Disney's best, like ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi, Boo,"" ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Sing Sweet Nightingale,"" ""So This Is Love,"" and the lighthearted treat, ""The Work Song,"" sung by the mice as they work on Cinderella's dress. The power of this film is the way it draws out genuine feelings of sympathy, suspense, fear, wonder, and ultimately joy. On the whole, Cinderella is a masterpiece just as much because of the strong emotions each scene can invoke as the glorious art it is composed of.

Now, as a Platinum Edition, 2-disc Disney DVD with a startlingly brilliant restoration done to the film itself (it looks GORGEOUS!), this set has some real jewels in the bonus features arena. However, it also seems to have more shameless Disney self-promotion than usual too. Disc one is particularly bad about this. Rather than giving us an audio commentary of any kind, we are given 2 modern (and weak) music videos, and Cinderella Sports Stories, presented by ESPN and hosted by Joe Namath. Okay, the sports thing does not belong in this set. `Nuff said about that. It was a cheap attempt to promote ESPN. As for the two videos, one is a Disney Channel Circle of Stars video, but without Hilary Duff, who cares? This one has a more recent cast: folks from ""Phil of the Future"" and ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"" (okay, those two shows aren't bad), along with cast members from ""That's So Raven,"" and I forget if anyone else was in there. The group sings (some of them do at least) an upbeat version of ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" and we get to see Phil of the Future flirting shamelessly with the cutest one in the group, Ashley Tisdale. I suppose if you are a fan of these `tween celebs, you'll dig this, and I'm fine with having one or two extra features of this nature as long as there are plenty of ""real"" extras. Oh, there is also a ""Making of"" featurette for that video. The other video is ""Every Girl Can Be a Princess,"" which is a new song ""performed by Cinderella,"" though it only shows clips of Disney Princesses, no new animation. This is for even younger kids than the previous video.

Disc Two is where one would expect the real meat of the bonus features to be, and they'd be right, but they also might be disappointed, as there are far fewer than on previous Disney Platinum Editions and still more kiddie stuff taking up space there. There are four sections on Disc Two. Deleted Scenes is first, and it holds two very interesting musical numbers not used in the film. We get to see them presented as storyboards and concept art set to the intended music. Music and More is the next section, and it holds vintage broadcasts and song demos, all a real treat! I loved the excerpt from Perry Como's show with guest Ilene Woods and a cameo by Clarence ""Ducky"" Nash. There are 3 enjoyable radio show clips and 8 song demos in addition to the Como segment. Games and Activities is the section where we get more of that kids' stuff you expect on Disney direct-to-video sequels more than on Platinum Edition releases. The main bit is ""House of Royalty,"" a three part commercial to push the Disney Princesses marketing machine. It's hosted by Disney Channel's Sally of ""Mike's Super Short Show,"" actually actress Alyson Stoner, and follows her as she goes on a mission to learn how to look, live, and act like a princess with the help of designer Isaac Mizrahi, the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition people, and the lovely Yugoslavian Princess Catherine Oxenberg. If you like any of these people or their shows, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It is generally for kids and a big commercial, but it's watchable at least once. There's also a Royal Life DVD-Rom Design Studio in this section, but, naturally, you use this on your computer. Personally, I never bother with DVD-Rom extras. And then there's the ""Princess Pajama Jam,"" which is dumb. It's a little video for kids that teaches them a weak princess dance, and it's actually imported over from the Disney Princess Party Volume 2 DVD. The last, and most important section on Disc Two is Backstage Disney. Here is where you'll spend most of your time on Cinderella extras. First, there's ""From Rags to Riches: The Making of Cinderella,"" which is an excellent 4-part retrospective that even includes interviews with people who actually worked on the film. ""The Cinderella That Almost Was,"" hosted by Disney producer Dan Hahn, gives us some great insight into unused ideas. ""From Walt's Table: A Tribute to Disney's Nine Old Men"" is a touching look back at Disney's legendary group of animators from the days of classic Disney animation. We are given personal accounts of these unique individuals from a group of high-end, modern Disney artists who knew and worked with them. Sitting around the very table of a Burbank pub that Walt and the 9 Old Men often sat at, Leonard Maltin joins the group for a lively interview focusing on remembering the masters and their work on Cinderella. It's truly a highlight of this DVD for those who are obsessed with Disney animation, like myself. Equally fascinating is ""The Art of Mary Blair,"" a new featurette that profiles one of Walt's favorite art directors/color stylists who brought the art of whimsy to Disney animation from the early `40s to the early `50s and was the artistic mind behind ""It's a Small World's"" unique look. When one gets a sense of her unique visual style, one can easily see how prevalent it is in the look of ""Cinderella."" The next feature is the most interesting ""Storyboard to Film Comparison"" you're likely to see on a DVD, because along with art you will see stills of the live-action reference footage that was used so heavily in this particular Disney film. Galleries are plentiful in this set too. In fact, there are nearly 400 still images to look through, and the DVD thankfully includes a slideshow feature to view them. All DVDs should have that option with their galleries. ""Backstage Disney"" rounds out with four more features. For those of us who are Disney maniacs, there's a pleasantly surprising indulgence: Walt's first shot at Cinderella. It's one of his Laugh-O-Gram films from 1922, and it is an amazing joy to watch if you are enthralled by animation history as much as animation today. Then, there's an excerpt from the Mickey Mouse Club (though I don't like excerpts, I like WHOLE episodes...) which features Helene Stanley, the live-action model for Cinderella and Davy Crockett's wife Polly, acting out a scene from Cinderella with the help of a few of the Mouseketeers. Six Cinderella trailers that can be viewed individually or with a ""Play All"" feature are the next offering, and the final one is ""Dreams Come True,"" which is basically a public service announcement to spread the word about how charitable the Walt Disney Company is today.

So, overall, the ""Cinderella"" 2-disc Platinum Edition may be a little weak in the bonus features area, in comparison to past Platinums at least, but there are still some excellent inclusions, and the DVD is a ""Must Own"" on the merits of the film alone and the marvelous restoration job done on it. Based on probably the best known and loved fairytale of all time, Disney's ""Cinderella"" is a masterpiece and one of the studio's finest achievements to this day. Pick it up before it's gone! And, I also highly recommend ""Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time."" I know what you're thinking. ""Cinderella 2"" is highly regarded as one of the worst Disney direct-to-video releases ever. Well, regardless of how you feel about that one, ""Cinderella 3"" is a worthy sequel! It's got a few flaws, but anyone who loves the original should at least give ""Cinderella 3"" a chance and keep an eye out for my review on it, coming soon! Other recommendations for those who enjoy ""Cinderella"": ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story,"" ""The Slipper and the Rose,"" ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella,"" ""Cinderfella,"" ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""A Cinderella Story,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Anastasia,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" ""the Cannon Movie-Tale film series,"" ""The Swan Princess,"" ""The Nutcracker Prince,"" ""The Black Cauldron,"" ""Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre,"" ""The Sword in the Stone,"" and ""Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears.""",1172016000,2,13111,4.8543992853952656

This movie was made in the 50s, before the civil rights movement, so OF COURSE all of the characters would be white, that was the morality of the time, nothing surprising about it. A minority Cinderella wouldn't make much sense. The only downfall of the film is the cat and mouse game that takes up the good portion of the film and diverts its attention from Cinderella. THe prince's character is completele undeveloped, he has like 2 lines in it. The oscar winning song is rediculous. Overall, the movie does not go into the depth of the Cinderella story.

85931,5,0788802194,"It is interesting to compare the three original Disney fairytales (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella) with the three most recent ones (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin) as together they make up the most popular, the best beloved, and the most lucrative of the Disney cannon. It was only inevitable that the House of Mouse would eventually release a `Masterpiece Edition' of ""Cinderella"", and as a collector's edition it certainly doesn't disappoint in terms of restored sound and picture quality (though the special features are a mixed bag). Replacing this with my ancient VCR version of the movie was certainly satisfactorily; it is only when you compare the quality of a tape with a DVD that you really discover what you were missing.

As I mentioned earlier, it is interesting to compare the original fairytales with the more recent ones, especially in the portrayal of their young heroines. What made a woman desirable (and what an audience expected to see) was certainly different back then, as seen in the physical representations of Snow White, Princess Aurora and Cinderella (all dainty, feminine and graceful) as well as their opening shots: each woman is introduced with a scene of singing and domestic housework. This is in direct opposition with Ariel's rebellious adventures, Belle's love of reading and Jasmine's frustration at life in a gilded cage; as well as their determined attempts to take charge of their own lives. Snow White's one moment of  pro-activity is when she (sigh) cleans the cottage for the seven dwarfs and Aurora is almost dull in her passive allowance for life to guide her where it will (then she falls asleep for the rest of the movie).

But can the same be said for Cinderella? I've long since put up with criticism levelled against Disney's portrayal of Cinderella (not to mention the other two) that she not a good role model for young girls; that she is too weak-willed, too passive, too meek. I can only imagine that these people haven't seen the same movie as I have. Disney's Cinderella represents a different kind of strength; one of patience, forgiveness, kindness and hard-work, all traits that are ignored if not sneered at by today's standards. Despite her angelic nature, she is allowed to get angry at times, but even when she has reached her moment of despair, her fairy-godmother suggests that it is Cinderella's lingering hope in life that allows her to appear.

It's true that most of the time she is portrayed as slaving over her step-family. But there is a definite strength to her that cannot be denied: she stands up for herself when her stepsisters laugh at her. She makes every effort to do up her mother's old dress to wear to the ball. She comes up with an idea at a critical moment that gets her out of a locked room. And she has a sense of humour: when her sisters singing/playing the flute upstairs, Cinderella tells two of her mice friends that perhaps she should interrupt: ""the, er *music* lesson"", with an ironic raising of her eyebrows. And even taking into account the lack of actual action she has throughout the movie, we know that when it falls to the animals (to fix her dress/get her to the ball/get her downstairs to the Grand Duke and the glass slipper) they are doing it out of love for her. The length that these animals go to and the show of their devotion to her show us very clearly that she is someone worth going to so much trouble for.

In conclusion: Cinderella is not just an adequate, but a great role model for - not just girls - but anyone. Her kindness rewards her with friends that save her, her diligence helps her survive destitution, her faith allows a miracle to happen. It is a different kind of strength, but a strength nonetheless.

Also of interest is how Disney managed to tweak the well-known story into something familiar but fresh. Many of its features are now so well-known that people have forgotten how innovative they were at the time. For instance (to the best of my knowledge), this is the first time that the fairy godmother is presented as a grandmotherly figure rather than a youthful spirit; and the grand finale in which Cinderella replaces the broken glass slipper with the one she has been secretly carrying around in her pocket (come on, who doesn't cheer when that happens?) is a 100% Disney invention. Not everything works so well; with the exception of ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"", all of the songs are rather forgettable, and the Prince Charming remains a cipher throughout the entire movie, not even joining the Grand Duke on his kingdom-wide search to find his beloved. I can't help but feel that a little less of the animal-antics and a little more time on developing the Prince would have gone a long way.

There are some treats among the special features; particularly storyboards and demo-tapes for deleted scenes and songs, even the original recordings of radio-plays and television specials (even an expert from ""The Mickey Mouse Club!""), but also some duds: a series of shorts about sporting superstars. Huh? There's the usual ""Making Of"" featurette, which is half gushing about how wonderful the movie is and half legitimate information, and plenty of games and featurettes concerning how great it is to be a princess, which will appeal to little girls and bore everyone else. Best of all is a music video performed by ""Circle of Stars"", the latest Disney pre-teen sitcom stars - watching these guys prancing around the set, crooning, gyrating and power-fisting whilst singing a popified version of ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" is the funniest thing since the 1980's ""Phantom of the Opera"" music videos.",1166832000,5,5670,4.827160493827161

85935,5,0788802194,"Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, ""What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White."" That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella.

Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition ""extra."" In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau.

In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous ""Nine Old Men"" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural.

Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before (""Heigh Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" from Snow White, ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. ""Oh, we have a hit song, well, that's nice."" For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" from the movie's opening scene, ""The Work Song"" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene.

For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being ""the noisiest movie ever restored"" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists.

A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its ""Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)"". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is ""formatted to fit your television."" I just wish they hadn't lied about it.

Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed ""Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long."" Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better.",1153440000,105,5465,4.827107790821771
85946,4,0788802194,"A great story. Never happens in real life though. Great images, everything is very pretty. It's just one of those stories that we remember from our childhood. It's great to watch over and over again.",1150675200,2,199,4.714285714285714
85947,5,0788802194,"""Cinderella"" is an animated movie from Disney Studios that will be a family favorite to the end of civilization.  The 2-disc special edition DVD actually is an edition worth having.  The picture is sharp and clear and the multitude of extras has enough high spots to justify paying a bit more.

Walt Disney kept the story basic, which is where the beauty of this movie lies.  Cinderella lives with her step-mother, who is subtly wicked, and her two shallow, mean step-sisters.  Cinderella has to take care of the house, her step-sisters and her step-mother, while dressing in rags.  As we know, the house originally belonged to Cinderella's father.  In spite of Cinderella's oppression, she remains upbeat and manages to thrive; somehow keeping the treatment she receives from affecting her.

We also know that the king wants his son to marry because he hungers for the pitter-patter of little feet running about the castle.  The king conspires to have a ball in which all the eligible maidens of the kingdom are invited.

Cinderella sees a chance to have some joy in her life.  Cinderella really does not care if she meets the prince; she just wants to do something other than be a handmaiden, housekeeper and cook.  Cinderella's step-mother cleverly has her daughters destroy the dress made by Cinderella's animal friends, and Cinderella at last feels the despair that comes to a person held in slavery.

When all hope appears lost, Cinderella's fairy godmother appears, and with a bit of bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Cinderella is ready for the ball, glass slippers, carriage and all.  The ending of the story is all ready for to give us a good feeling.

The magic that Walt Disney gives this film comes from the colorful imagery and the comic relief provided by a host of critters.  Cinderella's main allies in this film are mice.  The continuing battle between the mice and Lucifer, a cat with a disposition much like that of Cinderella's step-mother and step-sisters, allows behavior that would have been inappropriate for the character of Cinderella.  The mice are permitted to voice the anguish that Cinderella usually is unable to.

The animation of this 1950 film is outstanding.  Remembering that each cell of this movie was hand-drawn and painted makes the achievement nothing less than incredible.  The scenes involving the castle and Cinderella's costume are superb examples of hand animation at its best.

This movie was nominated for seven significant awards and won four awards.  There are surprises in the awards.  One nomination was for the 1950 Hugo award for dramatic presentation.  The Hugo awards are for science fiction, and the nomination of ""Cinderella"" appears somewhat a field from the intent of the award.  The other surprises are that many of the nominations and awards came years and decades after the original 1950 release, including a 2005 nomination for a satellite award for this 2-disc special edition.

In addition to the Disney classic are dozens of features that extend for hours.  Some of the features are directly related to ""Cinderella.""  Some, such as those from ESPN, are more of a stretch.  Some of the features are interesting and enjoyable; others will be interesting to you depending on your tastes.

Once upon a time Walt Disney was the source for classy animated movies.  A few of these movies are timeless classics that will intrigue audiences and professionals alike.  This movie is one of those.  Enjoy!

85967,5,0788802194,"It's been years since I saw this film.  It used to be one of my favorites back when I was 6 or 7 due to the amazing animation and the catchiness of the songs that were being sung by cinderella and the fairy godmother.  But after elementary school, I gave up on disney films altogether for the new films being put out by disney didn't catch my attention anymore.

I am now 22 in college and I still don't watch disney movies much.  But that changed the other night.  Being bored, I was flipping through the TV channels and came across the disney channel and the beginning of cinderella happened to air.  I kept channel surfing but I couldn't find anything else so I flipped back to cinderella thinking that I was gonna just fall asleep or turn the tube off in frustration of not being entertained.

I was dead wrong.

While watching the opening scene where Cinderella wakes up and starts her chores of cleaning, dusting, washing and being the maid of her own house to her evil stepmother and stepsisters, I realized just good this movie is and I kept wondering why I gave up on such a classic disney film.  The film never ceases to entertain and it brings a positive message to people of any age whether male or female.

Never give up hope for your dreams cause they can come true.

Even though Cinderella had to do all the chores and endure all the obstacles thrown at her by her stepmother and stepsisters, she does it with a positive look of happiness and tenderness.  In every scene, you can just see all the good portrayed in her as she scrubs the floor or feeds the animals.  She does it all with a smile on her face and a song in her heart (literally) knowing that her dream of meeting that handsome prince would come true.  With the help of some mice, birds and a fairy godmother, her dream comes true and then some.

The animation in this film is excellent as well.  The moment as she scrubs the floors and bubbles pop up with her scrubing and singing is just beautiful.  Another moment is when her outfit is transformed by the fairy godmother into an elegant sparkling dress complete with the famous glass slippers.  Even other characters have their own little adventures such as the mice avoiding lucifer, the evil cat (A cat is just evil itself with a name like that).

After watching this film, I got out all my old disney movies (Aladdin, Peter Pan, etc.) and slowly started watching them again and recapturing the moments of when I was 6 or 7 watching them with fascination.  Yet out of all the disney films I had seen, this one stood out the most because it still applys to every human being with a dream or a drive.

Thank you Walt Disney for such an amazing film and for reminding us that no matter how much our heart is beating, if we keep on believing, the dreams that we wish will come true.",1139875200,3,2811,4.377649325626204
85968,4,0788802194,"There are two well known versions of Cinderella, the French version and the German Brothers Grimm.  Disney and Rodgers & Hammerstein used the more family friendly French version and Sondheim & Lapine used the more grisly Brothers Grimm.

The story is very simple.  A young girl's father remarries to vain and cruel woman with two daughters of her own.  Her father dies and the stepmother turns Cinderella into a servant.

The King wants his only child, the Prince to marry.  So he holds a ball with all the eligible maidens.  The evil stepmother and her two daughters attend but make sure that Cinderella does not.  Come to the rescue Fairy Godmother.  She does her magic and uses Cinderella's animal friend.  The Prince sees Cinderella and instantly falls in love.  But she has to leave before midnight and only leaves her glass slipper.

A search for true love begins!

This is a fun version of the fairy tale with the most violent villains of all three main versions of the story.  This is still a great movie but if you want the best get the Leslie Ann Warren version of the Rogers & Hammerstein TV special.

DVD EXTRAS:

Disc One -

Cinderella Stories presented by ESPN Classic: Joe Namath host 10 sports ""Cinderella Stories"" from teams like NY Jets in Superbowl III and 1980 US Hockey Team to individuals like Lance Armstrong and Mia Hamm. You can watch all ten or just the ones that you want. These are superficial but can be inspirational for young kids. (Total running time 34 minutes)

Music & More - Two music videos and a making of video (9 minutes total)  A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes is done by Disney Channel stars and shows that with today's technology anyone can be made to sound alright.  It also shows how you can take a great song and make it into drivel.  This is followed by making of video.  Every Girl Can be a Princess which uses clips from all the Disney ""Princess"" films.  The song was written for a Princess album.  It actually is very nice.

Disc Two -

Deleted Scenes - Two deleted scenes and an introduction by Don Hahn (Producer of Beauty and the Beast.  The Cinderella Work song is newly recorded and has the original storyboards.  Dancing on a Cloud is the original recording with the original storyboards. (10 Minutes)

Music & More -

Cinderella & Perry Como: A 7 minute excerpt of his show promoting the film.  Perry narrates with Ilene Woods (Cinderella) and the Fontaine Sisters as the mice singing the song live.  The end is a jazz version of Bibbidy Boobity Boo by Perry, Ilene and the sisters - this is great.

Cinderella Title Song: Original demo recording probably by the song writers (no storyboards). (2 minutes)

Unused Songs: 7 songs not used in the film - audio only (17 minutes).  Disney animated films always had unused songs.  Usually, the scene that it is used in was cut but sometimes it just didn't advance the story and this was the number one rule of songs.  They do not give singing credits on these.

Radio Programs: Three radio program excerpts promoting Ilene Woods (12 minutes) - Village Store introduces Ilene as Disney's choice for Cinderella and she sings When You Wish Upon a Star.  Gulf Oil Presents Ilene sings A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes.  Scouting the Star with no singing.

Games & Activities -

House of Royalty: Three six minute vignettes on Look - Live - Act Like a Princess.  These are for the youngsters only and they probably will not watch them more than once.  Although Act Like a Princess has some tips everyone could use.

The Royal Life - DVD ROM game in which you can point and click to make your dream castle, ball gown or bedroom.

Princess Pajama Jam - A really silly 3 minute game on dancing like a princess.  It would have been better if this lasted longer as a child's exercise program but it is really an advert for the Princess Party DVD.

Backstage Disney -

From Rags to Riches: The Making of Cinderella - Four featurettes totaling 39 minutes.  This is actually an indepth look at not only the film but Disney and has interviews (from 1995) with the original animators. The section on the voice casting is really interesting as many of the voices were well known character actresses. It is really great.

The Cinderella That Almost Was: This is a 14 minute featurette on the genesis of the story from a Silly Symphony to various early incarnations that were never used.  It is very interesting to see what didn't make it into the film.

From Walt's Table: A Tribute to Disney's Nine Old Men - This is a 22 minute round table discussion with today's top animated film makers discussing the original nine animators.  It is nice but nothing special.

The Art of Mary Blair - A fifteen minute tribute to the artist who helped conceive the style of many Disney animated features.

Storyboard to Film Comparison: Opening Sequence - A seven minute comparison of the film to the original story boards or live action reference shot.  These are always fun to watch.

Cinderella Still Galleries - Massive stills galleries from concept drawings to posters

1922 Laugh-o-Grams: Cinderella - An early animated short based on Cinderella set in current times.

Excerpt from The Mickey Mouse Club with Helene Stanley (1955): A four minute sequence with live action model Helene Stanley.",1139529600,21,5275,4.638918918918919

85970,3,0788802194,"My comments are concerning the film rather than the new DVD. As a child, Cinderella was my favourite fairytale, and therefore my favourite Disney movie. Nothing could compare with the magical moment when Cinderella's beautiful ballgown appears and she's off to the ball to meet her Prince Charming. Now my own daughter has fallen under the film's spell. As such, it must be said that it does the job Disney intended it to do - it enchants little girls and makes them believe in dreams.

I eagerly awaited seeing the film again with my daughter, after so many years, and I was struck by either how cynical I had become in the interim or how badly I was let down by my memories. To sum up, this is not one of Disney's finest hours.

The title character is supposed to be pure and good hearted, patiently waiting for her dreams to come true. Why then does she seem to be 'on the make'? She's a flirtatious vamp. She is only interested in herself and no-one else. The Prince appears incidental to her vision of herself as a perfect self-sacrificing angel.  This is typified in the awful 'torch' song, So This Is Love - which doesn't represent the ecstasy of first love at all but rather the self-satisfaction of a woman who has 'found' her mark. It is sung, like all Cinderella's other songs, in a 50s, Doris Day crooning style which completely detracts from the pure innocence Cinderella is supposed to represent. In contrast, the squeaky voice of Snow White and her obsession with cleanliness was at least believable and made you feel for her.

Not that Cinderella has much to congratulate herself over as the Prince, what little we see of him, is even more cardboard and stereotyped than his hapless counterpart in Snow White. Far more interesting are the characters of the bumbling King and Grand Duke, who should have been fleshed out more. Instead, this is a Disney movie, so we have interminable scenes of an 'evil' cat and 'good' mice (and the least said about the song sung by the mice, Cinderelly, the better).

The stepmother's character works well and in fact is more believable than Cinderella herself. The stepsisters are meant to be annoying but their antics take up far too much time. The fairy godmother has been turned into a scatterbrained old woman, whose song, the Oscar-winning Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo, must take the prize for the least 'magical' or 'fairylike' song of all time.  The transformation scene happens so quickly that you just feel 'is that it'? And if it's true, as others have said, that the beautiful sparkling silver dress is now blue, than Disney should be ashamed of itself and its marketing department.

It works for children and so it should, but sometimes children have to grow up. The magic I remember has long gone.",1138838400,2,2752,4.708939708939709
85971,5,0788802194,"I rate ""Cinderella"" with 5 stars because it's a wonderful story! The basic premise is about a young woman, who lives with her 2 step-sisters and step-mother. Sadly, the step-sisters and step-mother mistreat Cinderella and are extremely hateful to her. Despite Cinderella's problems at home with her wicked step-mother and step-sisters she keeps a positive attitude and learns to cope with the aid of her mice friends.

It's a wonderful fairy tale complete with a coach turned into a pumpkin, funny mice, who have a wonderful fondness for their freind Cinderella--and even comes complete with a fairy god-mother!

This is a wonderful & delightful story that little girls, especially, will find amusing, entertaining, and inspirational!

Highly recommended for children of all ages as there are no death themes like in other films and it has a wonderful message!

85997,4,0788802194,"Yes I am, I'm also a cynical little cow as well to believe in love at first sight anymore, but somehow, watching this after all these years, I was transported back to my childhood, practically crying when those evil sisters ruined her dress. And my mum, I swear, was thinking of her future (and at the moment, non-existent) grandchildren to watch this with. She's got a long wait.

The only quibble I have about Cinderella & Disney films in general was the character designs are so limited. Cinderella could have easily passed for Sleeping Beauty; Lucifer the cat is the exact same cat who is in Alice In Wonderland, and the prince (who's name is never revealed) is exactly the same as Prince Eric, in Little Mermaid. (Who yes, I did have the doll of, but I preferred my Ken doll.)

Cinderella is such a classic story, and there have been so many live action movies made since - Ever After, and The Cinderella Story for example. The film is also full of brilliant characters, the mice (""Cinderelly, Cinderelly""...""Gus Gus!"") are the only animals I've ever liked in a Disney movie, and the evil stepsisters are just fantastic! I actually hated them!!! Eleanor Audley is brilliantly icy as the voice of the evil stepmother, later went on to voice Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty.

I'm still not sure why ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" was Oscar nominated, as I cringed listening to it, and watching it - it's just one of those songs, which is just so *insert your own word here* that you can't bear to listen to it.

The film does however, lose it's magic after the ballroom scene, and seems obvious what is going to happen. However, not to your starry eyed youngster, who will straight after beg mummy for so much of the Disney merchandise that's aimed at kids now.

Cinderella is still as magical to me, as it was so many years ago (OK, not that long ago, I am still in my early 20s after all), but unfortunately, my love of the film is clouded by being simply too old to believe in being able to fall in love with someone within hours of meeting them. It's the whole Polar Express bell thing again. I'm too cynical now, and no longer believe in the standardised Prince Charming. He doesn't exist. (He was too clean cut anyway.)

There are plenty of extras to go with this special edition, but many are aimed at the youngsters, as that's where Disney DVDs are aimed at. Let's forget about the old ones, just looking to relive their childhood dreams.

Did nobody ever think that, heaven forbid, Cinderella had stubbed her toe in those glass slippers, there would have been blood everywhere?!",1137369600,2,2579,4.617903930131004
85998,3,0788802194,"My daughter loves the story of Cinderella and she has become very familiar with the Disney character designs so I decided to get this movie for her.  But this is no Rodgers and Hammerstein telling of the tale.  My daughter found it disappointing  and will stick with her other versions.

I was very surprised when I watched this with her.  Unlike many versions, this one does a good job of setting up the family dynamics and how Cinderella found herself with such unagreeable family.  But after that goes downhill.  Cinderella is very kind-hearted and tries to find the good in everybody.  She has made friends with mice and birds and even made clothes for them.  Unfortunately fully half, yes, half, of the movie is made up of mice trying to get away from a cat.  I couldn't believe it!  Here I am looking for a classic Cinderella story and I get a game of cat and mouse.

When the film is not busy showing us the cat and mice, it does attempt to tell the story.  The ending is handled in a slightly different way and there is no Queen (just the King and Prince).  When it was all over I felt that I had spent too much on the movie and had wished it had been a rental (I doubt it will get played again).  I also did not find myself humming or singing the music.  My advice is to stick with the Lesly Ann Warren version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic.",1136332800,16,1359,4.291338582677166

Although there may be other versions you enjoy and will have in your collection, this DVD version of Disney's classic 'Cinderella' is a 'must-have'!!!

Thank you, Disney, at last!!!

""...but you see, I have the other one!""

You go, girl---Cindy---you go!!!

86003,5,0788802194,"Cinderella is a dazzling fairy tale classic loved worldwide. Here in the 2-Disc Special Edition, we behold its picture and sound restored and a second bonus disc that Cinderella lovers of all ages should enjoy. My favorite section, ""Backstage Disney"" has Ilene Woods, the girl that when Walt Disney heard her voice for the first time said, ""That's my Cinderella.""  It's great to see the fair face and lovely personality that inspired Cinderella in Ilene.  Cinderella is the epitome of true beauty.  What really makes a ""princess?"" It isn't Cinderella's royal blood, as I believe most  view her as a princess in her rags, way before she ever marries the prince. Her kindness, purity and gentleness--these attributes are what is behind the lovely princess who is Cinderella. I think she is a superb role model for young girls everywhere that a good attitude/heart and kind, respectful words are what makes one truly lovely, not just the outward appearance. Having physical beauty without inner beauty just isn't beauty. I'm glad this movie inspires all the beautiful ""princesses"" out there to be both! And to remember, ""No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true.""

Cinderella is a timeless classic.  I can't imagine an era when it will not touch your heart, warm your smile, and make you thankful for the family you DO have, however dysfunctional.

This Gift Set also includes an animation cell; one which is not mentioned at the time of this writing, in the additional features section.  To own a Disney animation cell is, for me at least, a rare treat; one which I did not expect.

The color and sound is magnificient!  It brought me great joy to watch this beloved movie the way I remembered it from my early childhood.  This work, like Sleeping Beauty, was in desperate need of restoration, which was done in loving detail and unerring professionalism.

The Collector's booklet is wonderful, and the pages within a true treasure.

Enhanced with subtitles in English, Spanish, AND French, this work is truly a work of art once again!

Complete with making of featurettes, interviews, and hours of extras any fan of Disney and/or the Cinderella story will thoroughly enjoy, this Gift Set is a wonderful value for the price!",1134691200,2,1192,4.827586206896552

86016,4,0788802194,"The Platinum Edition of ""Cinderella"" is another excellent job by Disney of restoring one of the early classics and releasing it on DVD.  This is a 2 DVD package, with the first DVD containing the 1950 movie in its original format (which in this case is the same as a standard TV), a feature from ESPN on ""Cinderella"" stories, and a couple of music videos and a making of a music video feature.

The second DVD is simply packed with extras, including a making of feature; a ""Cinderella"" that almost was feature; deleted scenes; a feature on Disney's nine old men (the animators for many of Disney's classics); another feature on Mary Blair; excerpts from shows at the time which featured ""Cinderella"" such as Perry Como and the Mickey Mouse Club; and much more.  The most interesting parts for me were learning how this movie played a significant role in keeping Disney from closing, and the different storylines they had for Cinderella that they dropped in favor of the movie we now know.

The movie itself is the important piece though, and this is a very good Disney movie, but I don't think it is their best.  The weaknesses of the film to me are: the ball where nobody dances except the prince and Cinderella; The Prince's character is never fully developed, and what little we do see makes him appear rude (yawning at the introductions to guests and walking away from them); and lastly the inability of the Stepmother to recognize Cinderella at the ball.  The last one is not believable because they chose to keep Cinderella very clean and beautiful in her ordinary life, and so the transformation in no way makes her unrecognizable.

The strengths of the movie far outweigh these weaknesses though.  The Stepmother is one of their greatest villains.  There songs are great as well as important to the story.  The Fairy Godmother scene is certainly one of the most memorable ones from any Disney movie.  Also, I thought the decision to make the animation of Cinderella and the Stepmother (and to some extent The Prince) more realistic than the other characters was very effective in telling the story.

The movie was nominated for many awards.  In 1950 it was nominated for the Golden Lion and won a Special Prize which was the only award it has ever won.  In 1951 it was nominated for three Oscars:  Original Song (Mack David, Al Hoffman & Jerry Livingston), Scoring of a Musical Picture (Oliver Wallace & Paul J. Smith), and Sound Recording.  In 1960 it was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.  In 1999 at the Young Artist Awards, Lucille Bliss (who did the voice of Anastasia) was nominated for the Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award.  Lastly, in 2001 it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for Dramatic Presentations from the year 1950.",1133827200,,2796,4.753623188405797
86017,5,0788802194,"One of Disney's classic films, ""Cinderella"" is now available on this two-disc Platinum Edition DVD set. It's a tale of a girl who has a dream and finds that though she's been dealt a hard lot in life, her dream can still come true.

I think pretty much anyone that would be reading this would know this story, but just in case --- ""Cinderella"" features a girl, Cinderella (of course!), her two wicked stepsisters and her cruel and evil stepmother. Also living with her are a spoiled, mean-hearted cat, Lucifer and a group of cute little mice who can talk to her and she can talk to. Things weren't always like this for Cinderella. Her father was a kind man and things had always been nice for her, but when he passed away, her stepmother revealed her true colors. She took the family fortune for her and her daughters and made Cinderella a servant girl, forced to tend to their every whim. All of this has not made Cinderella bitter, though, and her heart and spirit remain as pure and beautiful as the day she was born.

Now, things are starting to look up for Cinderella. She's made a new friend, a new mouse in the house and a royal ball has been announced. She really wants to go and is told that she can, if she has a lovely dress to wear. But when the wicked stepsisters ruin the dress, even she can't help but begin to despair... until a little magic happens.

""Cindrella"" is a powerful tale from beginning to end. The viewer gets involved not just with the story, but with the characters as well, even the affairs of the smallest characters of all, the mice. The story is moved along by several great songs including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and ""So This is Love.""

This new Platinum Edition DVD set is a great way to rediscover the Disney ""Cinderella"" story. It features a digital presentation with enhanced picture and sound, 5.1 Surround Sound Theater Mix and French and Spanish Language tracks and subtitles.

Of course, this wouldn't be a Platinum Edition DVD if it didn't have great special features. My favorite is ""Cinderella and Perry Como,"" a black-and-white segment featuring the live-action Cinderella, the voices of the mice and Perry Como. They talk about the movie and Perry Como expertly performs ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" along with the voices of the mice. There are several deleted songs, my personal favorite being the ""Cinderella Work Song."" This is an alternate take on the song performed in the movie by the mice as they make their dress for Cinderella. Cinderella fantasizes about what it would be like if there are more of her.

Other bonuses include publicity pictures and characters sketches, a short segment from ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" a ""Laugh-o-Gram"" that's a simplified verison of the Cinderella story and the promos for the original theatrical release and subsequent video releases and theatrical rerelease. There are also games, including a Princess Pajama Party.

Perhaps the most unusual special feature is the ""Cinderella Stories."" Apparently hoping to lure sports fans, or get girls' fathers interested, these are ESPN segments about various sports teams that won great victories against tough odds.

All in all, a great package. I'm now interested to see the upcoming Cinderella III, for which a short trailer was included in this release. Apparently the Stepmother gains some sort of black magic power and takes Cinderella's happily-ever-after away. Harsh!",1133654400,,3435,4.829931972789115

86022,3,0788802194,"I looked forward to this DVD release for months and snagged a copy the first day it was available.  My excitement turned to dismay, however, as I began to watch it.  From the moment the birds open the curtains to reveal Cinderella in her bed, it became painfully obvious that Disney truly had ""enhanced"" the picture to within an inch of its life.  Instead of restoring this beloved classic film, the images have been changed; this is NOT Cinderella as she was first seen in 1950.  Just to make sure I wasn't mistaken, I did a comparison between my parents VHS tape (the original video release) and the DVD.  True, the picture on the DVD was much sharper and the sound was crystal clear, but Cinderella's hair was NEVER that color of yellow, and lines that were part of the original animators drawings, faithfully inked and painted onto the original cells, are no longer visible.  For instance, right at the beginning of the film, when Cinderella turns over in her bed to shut out the sun, there were originally clearly drawn/inked lines in her blanket to show the drapery of the fabric.  Those lines, obvious in the VHS version, are now only visible if you zoom in on them.  Similar editorial decisions on the part of the DVD authors are evident throughout the film, though they decrease in frequency as the film progresses.  It could be said these changes don't matter much, but they truly affect the look of the film.  I often found myself thinking it looked like a Scooby-Doo cartoon, a far cry from any Disney classic.  Although I understand that Disney owns this intellectual property in the legal sense, I don't understand why the've chosen to disrespect that very property, especially in light of their excellent work on Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Bambi, etc.  Hopefully, this is an anomaly and Disney won't continue to offer us disfigured films.",1132876800,396,1855,4.744548286604362
86023,5,0788802194,"Stunning new 2-disc `Platinum Edition' of Disney's 1950 fairytale confection CINDERELLA.  The story is as old as the hills: Cinderella is mistreated horribly by her cruel Stepmother and stepsisters Anastasia and Drisella.  Her only friends are some pet mice, the birds and her faithful dog and horse.  When the Prince invites all the eligible maidens in the land to his grand ball, Cinderella is heartbroken when her Stepmother forbids her to go.  Enter the magical Fairy Godmother, who, with a little ""Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo"" magic, enables Cinderella to live out her happily-ever-after dream.

From a historical perspective, the Disney studio was pinning it's future on the success of CINDERELLA.  World War II had virtually wiped out the studio's international market and films like PINOCCHIO, BAMBI and FANTASIA had lost a lot of money on their initial releases.

Disney has performed a complete restoration on the film, including an extensive frame-by-frame cleanup of the original camera negative and the result is eye-popping (almost alarmingly-so as every hint of speckle, dirt and debris has been removed).  The film looks showroom-new and it's hard to believe the thing was actually made over 50 years ago.  Likewise the soundtrack has been sweetened with Disney furnishing the film with an all-new ""Enhanced Home Theatre"" 5.1 mix.  But purists need not worry, as the original mono soundtrack is also included.

There are some fantastic extras on Disc Two including an all-new `Making-Of' documentary which features recent interviews with Ilene Woods (voice of Cinderella), Mike Douglas (the Prince) and Lucille Bliss (Anastasia).  ""The Art of Mary Blair"" is an invaluable look into the life of the revered Disney concept artist and designer; ""The Cinderella That Almost Was"" hosted by Don Hahn explores the scenes, songs and characters that were considered but eventually cut from the final film.  ""Disney's Nine Old Men"" is a charming segment hosted by Joel Siegel which has the leading Disney animators of today remembering the trailblazers who created the classic Disney animated masterpieces.

There is also a charming clip from Perry Como's television show which publicised the film with a performance from Ilene Woods.  A clip from ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" features Helene Stanley (the live-action reference model for the Cinderella character) enacting a scene with the help of the Mouseketeers.  There are also extensive galleries,  interactive games and DVD-ROM components.

There are however some needless (and downright questionable) extras like the ESPN Classic ""Cinderella Stories"" programme, which profiles sport celebrities and their rise to fame.  Just what exactly does all this have to do with Disney's Cinderella?  Plain boring old filler.  That said, the rest of the package is outstanding.

We like it because there are no scary villians or ""tense"" scenes like most Disney cartoons have. Of course, the stepmother is not nice to Cinderella, but our daughter just talks about how she is not being nice. It's also nice because it's not too long of a movie.",1131753600,22,516,4.375
86045,5,0788802194,"This is marvellous - this two disc set has some wonderful extras, but I have to admit I thought I would be more interested in them than I actually was, I looked at a few of them (the deleted songs, the opening sequence, the story of the making) just once, and really all that I ever play for my daughters is the actual movie.

I don't know what the difference with the undigitally remastered version is, but this is a beautiful movie. There is teh 'old fashioned' singing in it - Cinderella has a real 40's feel in her singing style, but they are lovely songs and nicely rendered. It compares much better with modern times than Snow White which has an extraodinarily unusual voice for the lead in that.....but I digress.

This is a great movie, the story is nicely and simply told for children, has great animation and secondary characters in the animal characters. I like the fact that Cinderella is beautiful without some of the 'sexiness' of later heroines (Princess Jasmine et al)

Cinderella is cruelly treated by her step-mother and her two step sisters - she is forced to char and scrub and serve them. However she is good and kind. Her nature and her hope mean that when she really needs help her fairy god-mother appears. She goes to the ball, the prince falls in love with her and it of course all ends happily ever after.

The only annoying thing (I found as an adult) was the chipmunk-style voices of the mice - but my kids didn't mind.

I nice movie to put on for a wet day - entertaining, sweet and with a positive message to it - that goodness and hope will overcome.",1131148800,3,1582,4.422680412371134
86046,3,0788802194,"This version of the Cinderella story is more about the critters (mice, cat, dog & birds) than it is the story which may have inspired the infamous ""cinderella complex"" in modern women.  Actually, this animated film would have been better served by making it a critters in the household film or a Cinderella-focussed story, so instead it tries to be both and fails.  There are now easily discernible anti-feminist statements: Not only the ""cinderella complex"" - how a prince will be the one to save the girl from any situation - but also how the animals work their assignments: the male rodents are active, adventurous, taking on all the treacherous assignments, while the female rodents are left sewing and Cinderella attires the rodents in clothing suited to little boys or girls, like the ""clothes make the man.""  Don't even get me started on the songbirds.  The original fairytale had the royal ball taking place over a series of three nights, rather than the one event usually portrayed in films, however if you really want a good film to watch focussing on the Cinderella story, the one I'd recommend is the Drew Barrymore EVER AFTER.  It's minus the cute cuddly animals, so that part of the traditional fairy tale is missing, but otherwise it's superior story-telling.",1131062400,4,1274,4.906976744186046

86049,5,0788802194,"I found myself completely transported back in time watching this excellent release of Cinderella on DVD. Within the first 30 seconds, I was able to relive parts of my childhood, and the excitement of seeing the story.

Of course, my adult eye also took over and caught so many things that I never noticed before. The King was much more manipulative and temper prone, where as a kid I thought he was just ""funny"". The step sisters, in my memory were much more of an archetype of evil and backstabbing, came off as being pathetic and powerless. The fairy godmother comes off as more fumbling, and not Glinda good witch of the north that memory portrays her to be. All three of these things change the overall tones and add a lot more irony to the dynamics between the characters.

Imagine my biggest surprise of Cinderella herself, who had much more 'backtalk' then my memory served. Even though she was in a subservient role (forced into it) she is portrayed so much more as being powerful and that she is allowing her step mother and step-sisters to have control.  It is so much fun to re-watch this film and really think about it.

On the DVD side, the film looks astonishingly good. Jaw on the floor kind of good. Even better than the Bambi release (which was spectacular). That plus the superb sound quality (totally takes advantage of the speakers) makes for a great high quality release.

The extra materials are high quality, and do a very good job of targeting both the adult and the child viewer. This DVD is something that I know I could share with a child or with a spouse. That is no easy task.

Overall, I would highly recommend adding this title to your collection. You won't be disappointed.",1129939200,5,1705,4.573770491803279

Extras ****

Disney has, once again, released a great DVD edition of one of their classics. These titles are what DVDs were meant to be; great editions of the film, tons of extras, a joy to watch. But haphazard organization of the extras, glaring examples of corporate synergy and a couple of minor glitches mar the overall presentation.

""Cinderella"" is one of the most celebrated classics created by the late filmmaker. A gentler reworking of the fairytale, the film remains extremely popular among young and old. The DVD edition features a restored picture bringing all of the brilliant pastel colors to life and a digital soundtrack allowing all of the memorable songs to be heard as though they were recorded yesterday.

Cinderella's (Ilene Woods) wicked stepmother and two step-sisters have taken over the house once owned by her beloved father who has died. Stepmother spends every cent on her two daughters, singing lessons, dresses, every luxury, leaving Cinderella to do all of the housework in the large chateau, an indentured servant in her own home. Cinderella's only friends are the mice, including Gus and Jacques, and other animals that help her through the day. The King decides to host a ball for his returning son, the Prince, insisting that every eligible woman in his kingdom attend. After working her to the bone, Stepmother leaves Cinderella behind and takes her daughters. Distraught Cinderella loses all hope until her Fairy Godmother (Verna Felton) appears.

Summarizing an animated film is difficult. So many different things contribute to the success that merely describing it, without giving everything away, doesn't seem to give the film its due, to capture the magic.

""Cinderella"" is a magical blend of great animation, fun songs and amusing animal characters. From the moment the book opens and the animation starts, you realize you are in for something special. Artist Mary Blair helped to create the look of the film, a blend of pastel colors perfectly evoking the period of storybook France in which the story is set. If anything, the restoration has made these colors a little too crisp, but they are bright and beautiful to look at.

The film is filled with classic Disney music. From ""Bippi Boppi Boo"" to ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes"", some of the most fondly remembered music in the Disney library included in this classic. Clearly, very fond of this story, Disney worked on it for a long time. When the finished product was released, and praised, it became a hallmark of his work, a template for many, many animated efforts. It isn't a coincidence that he chose to put Cinderella's castle smack dab in the middle of his first theme park. In 1955, with Disneyland about to open, he realized that this film was one of his best and would continue to endure. Now, every version of the Magic Kingdom has a Cinderella Castle.

After watching Cinderella's horrible life with her wicked stepmother and step sisters, the moment when the Fairy Godmother transforms her, complete with 1950s era gown and hairstyle, is truly magical. Watching Cinderella get a taste, no matter how small, of the life she truly deserves is a gratifying experience. Maybe it's just me, but does it confuse anyone else why the Fairy Godmother makes the mice into horses and the horse into the coach driver? It seems a bit like putting the cart before the horse.

All of this magic more than makes up for the rather simplistic view of love presented in the film. The prince falls in love with Cinderella because she looks beautiful. He wants to dance with her before they even speak. He shuns all of the other women, rolling his eyes, simply because they aren't beautiful. Also, don't forget to ""leave the sewing to the women"". Great lessons for the little girls watching. I guess this was appropriate for 1950.

As with most of the recent deluxe DVD sets, ""Cinderella"" is filled with extras. I haven't had a chance to go through them all, but a few are worth mentioning.

Unlike in the past, the extras aren't organized quite as well. The first disc features the restored film but also includes ""ESPN's Cinderella Stories"", short documentaries on Joe Namath's New York Jets' team, the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team, Mia Hamm and the Williams Sisters. This is taking corporate synergy to an all new, ugly level. Joe Namath on ""Cinderella""? There are also ""Coming Attractions"" for other Disney releases. I'm glad to see ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Lady and the Tramp"" will both get the Platinum treatment next year.

The second disc contains material for both young and old. In previous releases, Disney has included all of the kid related material on the first disc, along with the film, leaving the second disc for the archival material. For ""Cinderella"", almost everything is combined on disc number two.

Perhaps the most interesting extras are two songs which were recorded for the film, but ultimately deleted. They are included with original concept art. If you need any evidence about how important it was to restore the soundtrack, just listen to the ""Cinderella Work Song"" and ""Dancing on a Cloud"", both in their original recordings. It is fun to watch the art, and hear the music, but they sound like recordings made from old LPs. Also, there was a minor glitch with my DVD. I chose the PLAY ALL function. After a brief intro, it skipped the first song and went directly to the next.

An interesting side note: ""Dancing on a Cloud"" would later be adapted for ""Sleeping Beauty"".

There are also seven deleted songs. Again a glitch seems to be present; it skipped two of these offerings when I pressed PLAY ALL. Like most classics, deleted material was usually deleted for good reason and none of these songs is particularly memorable.

The most interesting extras are four short documentaries. ""The Cinderella That Almost Was"" tracks Disney's work with this project over the years.  ""From Rags to Riches"" is a more traditional ""making of"" documentary. ""The Art of Mary Blair"" explores her contribution to the look and feel of this project. As noted earlier, she was responsible for the beautiful pastel look so important to this film. Last but not least is ""From Walt's Table: A Tribute to Disney's Nine Old Men"". The nine old men are the guys who worked on most of Disney's best films, shaping the look, the characters, everything that helped to make them memorable today.

A variety of radio and television programs promoting the film are included, including bits with Perry Como and an excerpt from ""The Mickey Mouse Club"".

The least interesting extras involve more corporate synergy. ""House of Royalty"" is a featurette tied into ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" and features Sally, from the Disney Channel. Just the description scared me away.

The obligatory music videos featuring current popular acts singing the classic songs, games and CD Rom material are included, along with a preview of ""Cinderella III"" and a 1922 Laugh-o-Gram based on the same fairy tale.

Any time Disney releases one of these Platinum Edition DVDs or the super deluxe editions they did for ""The Lion King"" and ""Snow White"", I will eagerly plunk down my money for a copy. But I wish they would return to a format of putting the kids stuff on the same DVD as the movie and putting all of the historical, technical and encyclopedic extras on a separate disc. I don't want to have to wade through music videos with tween singers and games about dress-up in my quest to learn everything I can about the making of a classic.

""Cinderella"" is a full-fledged classic and a must for every library. Kids will love it. Adults will remember it fondly. Film buffs and historians will love the informative extras. Go. Buy it!",1129766400,10,7746,4.861153262518968
86051,5,0788802194,"Cinderella - Disney Special Platinum Edition (2005)

Yes, I'll admit I have never watched this show.  So I popped it in the day my wife picked it up and watched it with my son and father-in-law.  The fact that all three generations found it entertaining was worth the purchase price.  The picture and color are incredibly sharp, and the sound crystal clear.  In this Disney version of the Grimm fairy tale, the antics and expression of the supporting cast (the mice, the evil cat Lucifer, the King) do a good job of holding your attention throughout the movie.  My son (2.5 years) enjoyed the part where the King and his Duke was bouncing up and down the bed - guess what my son decided to do later that night?  As they say, it's the small things that count.

The songs, according to my wife, are what make this movie.  Sing Sweet Nightingale, Bippidy Bobbidy Boo, So This is love, etc.  It's hard not to sing along with songs that you grew up singing, and now the next generation can too.  I wasn't too happy with the bonus songs on Disc 1.  They were forgetable and souless.  However, Disc 2 does have a lot of Disney-Cinderella related information.  The bit on Mary Blair, and the roundtable discussion on the ""Nine Old men"" were quite informative.  There's enough material on Disc 2 to fill up one night.

""Cinderella Work Song"" was meant to have Cinderella all on her own, but the lyrics were changed so it would have the mice sing it.  When Cinderella and Prince Charming danced together, they sang, ""Dancing On A Cloud""...but that replaced with ""So This Is Love"".

86065,5,0788802194,"This has got to be one of my favorite Disney fairy tales of all time. I'm so glad this cam out on DVD, and I'm really looking forward to getting it for myself this weekend. The song ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"" basically sums out the entire story: A young girl named Cinderella (Illene Woods) dreams of a better life, and has the one opportunity to make it happen when an invitation from the palace comes to invite her to the ball. But, she nearly gives up on her dreams when her evil stepmother (Eleanor Audrey, ""Sleeping Beauty"") & 2 jealous stepsisters ruin her dress made by her animal friends. But with the help of a very motherly fairy godmother (Verna Felton, ""Dumbo"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""The Jungle Book""), Cinderella's dream of meeting Prince Charming (Mike Douglas, ""The Mike Douglas Show"") comes true. And the rest is history.

This timeless fairy tales reminds all of us that the work you do towards others can sometimes create its own rewards or its own punishments. And with a little bit of hope, dreams really can come true.

I especially love the Bonus Features they have to offer. OK. I admit that the music video by Disney Channel's Circle of Stars (Raven, Orlando Brown, Annaliese Van der Pol, Kyla Pratt, Ricky Ullman, etc.) is a little awkward to sing in a pop version instead of a ballad. It would of been nice to see the music videos of this or another song sung by either Michael Bolton, Linda Ronstadt, Kimberly Locke, or James Ingram. But other than that, it sounds really nice. I also liked the behind the scenes, deleted scenes & songs, and special showings of the cast & crew on television in the past & present. The ESPN Cinderella stories have a lot to do with fairy tales, because in a way, anyone, including athletes, can live a Cinderella story. And all stories are the same. ""And they lived happily ever after.""

The one thing I wouldn't recommend is the behind the scenes making of ""Cinderella III"". It's a way too scary for the stepmother to wind back the clock before the ball. Sorry Disney, but this was a bad idea.

Buy this magical DVD today. It doesn't last forever, so buy it before the stroke of 12:00 on the last day it's out!",1129075200,,2183,4.505050505050505
86066,5,0788802194,"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated ""Sleeping Beauty"" which made it's debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: ""Cinderella"" (1950). Of the three films, ""Cinderella"" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike ""Snow White"", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. ""Cinderella"" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like ""Snow White"", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting.

A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale"" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in ""Sleeping Beauty"", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"") her own show-stopper.

Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.

In conjunction with the film's 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) ""Cinderella"" has just been released on a special edition DVD. It simply has never looked better. The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, ""Cinderella"" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a ""Cinderella"" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a ""Dream Come True.""

86067,5,0788802194,"Disney has released 5 of there most popular movies of all time on prestigious platinum editions. They all have been totally remastered with superior digital Cinderella makes #6 in this spectacular series and it is no different then the first 5

The picture is dramatically enhanced just watch the trailers on the dvd and it shows how Cinderella originally looked with all the grain and scratches and off color.  Now compare it to the restored version and it looks a whole lot better not a single scratch or graininess.

Walt Disney continues to release great dvd's and Cinderella looks like a brand new movie despite being 55 years old.  The Sound has been remastered to rid of the hiss you find in old films.  If you have the VHS version which most of us Disney fans do the DVD is defintely worth a purchase plus dvd's last longer anyway as long as you take proper care of them.  So if you want to enjoy this for years to come i suggest getting this dvd.  Remember Limited Time Only you know the following January after the Platinum edition is released Disney slams it back in the vault for 5-10 years  they are leaning more towards 5 years though.

The Special Features are on the plain side more catered to girls it seems but the movie is great and that is what I look for not so much the special features.

86068,4,0788802194,"I'm not going to waste time on the story of Cinderella since it's probably the most famous story ever told.

As we have come to expect from Platinum Edition releases, Cinderella boasts a fantastic video and audio transfer. The video is devoid of all print flaws, grain, artifacts, dirt, etc. The audio is devoid of all hisses, pops, crackles, etc. Although I know all Platinums will recieve fantastic restoration jobs, I can't help but be shockingly impressed every time one comes out, especially of an older film, at the clarity and crispness of everything.

This time, bonus features are a little iffy, ranging from the vapid and shallow (Games, music videos) to the downright bizarre (What do sports stars have to do with fairy tales and princesses?) to the amazing and incredibly in-depth. (Making-of, deleted scenes, a large gallery of trailers, even radio programs and unused song demos!)

I can't not recommend this latest Platinum Edition release though. Cinderella is a charming film that hasn't lost any of its warmth, heart, beauty, and charm in the 55 years since its first theatrical release.

It is also worth noting to be on the lookout for Disney's next two Platinum Editions, both to be released in 2006 - Lady And The Tramp, releasing February 28, and The Little Mermaid, releasing October 3. If past precedent fortells the future, these will both also be bang-up Disney DVD jobs.

86069,3,0788802194,"A delightful richly artful animation piece, a true classic; gorgeous in sound and colours.

However, this was made in the 50's and be aware of the prejudices that really irk me:

(1) Depicts cats as evil: Why are cats depicted as evil??? Cats are NOT evil. In Disney's Cinderella, the cat is fat, sneaky, and personifies something demonic that deserves to die. In fact, he does;he's called ""Lucifer"", which is the name of Satan. This prejudice really disgusted me as cats are no more evil than other animals and cannot help being born a cat.

(2) All heroines are lilly white caucasians. What is this saying about people of other races?

(3) All good looking, handsome men and beautiful women are good with kind hearts; plain looking or ugly are evil. Nice depiction of Drucilla and Anastasia. Plain girls, but vain, selfish, and evil minded who just want to do stepsister in.

Truth of the matter is, good looking handsome men and beautiful women can be vain and manipulative too, and ""ugly"" or plain people can be quite nice individuals with beautiful hearts.

(4) This show was made before the age of women's liberation. In those days, the main job of a woman is to get married, have babies and live happily ever after. This is almost a joke these days: This simply does not work these days (countless women are divorced with children and deadbeat dads). The worst morale of the story--the only way a woman can be happy is get married to Prince Charming. He will magically transform her into a princess. For all of the multitudes ""Prince Charmings""--countless numbers cheated, ran away, and even evade their responsibilities like credit card payments and child support. So much for Prince Charming.  Women these days should marry with a considerable amount of caution. And be watchful of STDs. Rich guys are in short supply and generally already taken (or they are gay), and women these days have to be self sufficient and cannot count on anybody. If it happens....great!...but don't count on it.

It's a great animation, but I gave it three stars because these prejudices really got under my skin. Sure it's a kid's movie, but what is this teaching young people?

86072,4,0788802194,"I finally got around to picking up a copy of the newly released Cinderella DVD and I'll simply start out by stating that I am quite pleased with it.

Cinderella's never really been one of my favorite Disney classics, it just wasn't the fairy tale as I knew it and it featured too many boring scenes to keep my attention for long or ask for repeated viewings, however, the digital presentation is so fine and sharp that even the not-so-exciting scenes are amusing to watch.  I noticed a lot of color changes, being used to my old Black Diamond Classics VHS copy, but I trust Disney with their promise that these were the original colors.  The print looks flawless, crystal clear and I didn't notice any editings done to the movie.  Sound is near-perfect and much, much improved from previous releases.  French and Spanish language tracks are added, unfortunately, the Spanish one seems to be a rather mediocre Mexican re-dubbing which I'm not too content with.

Bonus features aren't expectacular, the most horrible one being the ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" music video by the Disney Channel Circle of ""Stars"" (Rather, a bunch of wannabee-cool&popular common teenagers).  Other bonus features are quite interesting, mainly the behind the scenes featurettes ""A Tribute to Disney's Nine Old Men"" and backstage material.  Theatrical trailers and art galleries are also a nice addition.  A number of added bonuses seem to be too child-friendly for me even if they are rather cute for a one-time viewing.

This DVD includes several sneak peeks at other upcoming Disney film releases, the greatest two being the long-awaited Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Little Mermaid (1989) Platinum 2 Disc Editions coming out February and October of next year.  Some disturbing ones include Cinderella III and Chicken Little (Which looks more horrifying everytime I watch it and that's bad).  Also included is a little metal Cinderella necklace which I'll be giving to one of my school galfriends.

Overall, this DVD debut of Walt Disney's Cinderella is highly recommended mainly for the new restored presentation and improved sound quality, bonus features I think you can live without. 4/5",1128902400,5,2183,4.997237569060774
86073,5,0788802194,"Walt Disney's animated CINDERELLA (1950) is such a magical and effortless blend of suspense, romance, and comedy that it is hard to believe thirty years went into the planning of it and that the fate of the studio in 1949 literally depended upon its success.  Fortunately, the resulting film is a masterpiece of animation that was both a critical and box office success when it opened in 1950; and it received three Oscar nominations, two for its wonderful song score.

Disney starts with the basic story, as always:  Cinderella and Prince Charming; the evil Stepmother and grotesque stepdaughters; a fancy ball and the importance of midnight.  But then he adds suspense with Lucifer the cat and great humor with the intrepid mice Gus and Jaq.  Watch when Cinderella is locked in the tower and the mice are trying to get the key out of Stepmother's pocket, then ascend the huge stairs that are seen from a mouse perspective.  And watch the scene with one mouse hiding under one of three coffee cups, but which cup?  This is suspense that Hitchcock would admire.  But it is also hilarious as Jaq and Gus keep outwitting Lucifer; and poignant when the stepdaughters do something awful to Cinderella, like ripping her dress, and the mice help out with ""The Work Song"" to make her a new dress.

The songs are fabulous and romantic and funny:  ""Sing Sweet Nightingale,"" ""So This Is Love,"" ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Bippidy-Bobbidy-Boo"".  They are by Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman.  The perfect character voices include Ilene Woods as Cinderella, Eleanor Audley as the terrifying Stepmother, and Verna Felton as the nice Fairy Godmother.

This CINDERELLA has always had a warm place in the Disney Studios' heart, and not just because it made it possible for the studio to stay open after 1950 and for the creation of Disneyland.  It is wonderful entertainment for all ages.  And the brand-new Technicolor re-creation looks like it was done frame by frame to remove every single speck of dust and scratch; the color just shimmers and the images are crystal-clear.  And the celebrated song score and soundtrack (the third Oscar nomination) sounds glorious and brand-new.

Disk 2 of the double disk has at least three hours (I didn't bother with Games & Activities) of bonus material.  Included are two wonderful deleted songs that I wish had not been deleted, a 1922 Cinderella Laugh-o-Gram, a portrait of the Nine Old Men (original animators), the story of stylish and colorful animator Mary Blair (who designed It's a Small World at Disneyland), making CINDERELLA and ""The CINDERELLA That Almost Was"", voice talents and just the right songs, Cinderella Ilene Woods on THE PERRY COMO SHOW in 1949 and doing radio spots.  I gave up when confronted with another 17 minutes of Unused Songs at 11:40 p.m.  Allot a whole evening for disk two.

The double disk CINDERELLA is a fabulous Technicolor sight and sound restoration, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen as a film scholar.  It belongs in every home with a child or a fairy tale lover.  Walt must be smiling down from Heaven in joy.  Whether you want the huge Collector's DVD Gift Set is a question of how much you adore CINDERELLA.  It includes a beautiful hardback book on the story and the making of the movie, step by step, which are on disk two of the movie set.  The gift set also includes eight lithograph character sketches and one piece of film in plastic.  Most people will be more than satisfied with the simple double disk of the movie, but you should at least know there is an elaborate DVD gift set.  Happy viewing!

86084,4,0788802194,"Disney's classic expansion of the well-known fairy tale still works, despite being a little on the bland side.  Cinderella and Prince Charming are generically beautiful, with little to distingish them visually.  Nevertheless, it's a joy to watch the seamlessly beautiful animation in this restored edition, done the traditional way--frame by frame--at a time when the smallest computers filled a room and were capable of only crude number-crunching.  This is one of the early examples of the Disney formula, which takes a fairy tale and populates it with songs and talking animals.  This basic template has worked time after time over the decades, and it works here as well.  No matter how aware I was of the shameless way in which the movie was manipulating me, I still found myself smiling throughout and genuinely involved in the climax, even though I knew how it would all turn out.",1128816000,3,886,5.0
86085,5,0788802194,"In an effort to revive his sagging animation department, Walt Disney turned once again to a fairy tale.  This time around, he chose one of the best known and oldest of them all, Cinderella.

The tale is familiar.  A beautiful girl is abused by her stepmother and stepsisters and forced to work as their slave.  When a ball is given for all the eligible maidens in the kingdom, Cinderella dreams of going too, only to have her hopes dashed at the last minute.  With a gift of magic, she is able to go, but only until the stroke of midnight.

The story is so well known, if fact, that any story about an underdog coming from behind and winning is called a Cinderella story.  Disney's job here was to make the story entertaining for 75 minutes.  The solution here was creating the animals.  Mice Jaq and Gus and their constant struggle against the evil cat Lucifer is funny and tying this sub-plot to the ultimate outcome is brilliant.  The other standout character is the stepmother who is frighteningly evil with no super powers.

As with any Disney movie, this one also has great songs.  Arguably the best known is ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.""  Right behind it is ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes.""  My favorite, however, is the often overlooked love song ""So This is Love.""

While not the best release in the Platinum series, it still stacks up well.  The movie has been restored, and it looks great to me.  I'm not a nitpicker, but I can't find any problems with the full frame picture, the original aspect ratio.  There is an enhanced 5.1 home theater mix, which doesn't seem quite as impressive as some other releases.  It seems more like the sound coming equally from all speakers.  Of course, given the age of the film, there probably isn't much more they could do.  For purists, there is an original soundtrack on the disc as well.

The extras in this set seem to be split between content for kids and adults, with the kids winning.  Disc one includes a new version of ""A Dream is a Wish"" with the stars of several Disney Channel series.  It also has several ""Cinderella stories"" in sports moments, a weird feature to me.  Disc two includes several features about living like a princess.

Also on disc two are the bonus features adult fans of this movie will want to watch.  There are two ""deleted scenes,"" which are really abandoned songs with the storyboards created for them.  In edition there are more abandoned songs with no storyboards on here.  It's pretty interesting watching how various ideas went from one form to another before finally making it into the movie.  Other extras include a thirty-eight minute documentary about the creation of the show, including achieved interviews with the animators behind the show.  We are also treated to an overview of how the movie progressed over the years it was in development, a tribute to the ""Nine Old Men,"" Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" version of the story from 1922, and radio promotion from the time.  I was thrilled to see trailers from the movie's multiple releases here.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary in sight.

This Platinum DVD release means that all of Disney's animated movies have been put on DVD at some point in the last few years.  While the Platinum series isn't quite as nice for adult fans as they used to be, this is still a release that fans of the movie will want to pick up.",1128729600,80,3358,4.633898305084746
86086,5,0788802194,I love this movie and was waiting for it to be released. Disney did a wonderful job restoring this movie. It reminded me of a simple time in my life where the most important thing on my mind was what to wear for school ( before the challenges of everyday life). Thank you Disney for bringing this movie back!,1128729600,,308,4.237288135593221
86087,4,0788802194,"First of all, I have to say the movie itself looks absolutely amazing. It was restored to perfection, and there's nothing about it that looks the slightest bit old. It was a pleasure to watch. I actually forgot how good that movie was because I only really remembered certain scenes and not quite in the correct order. The prince had way too small of a role, but other than that, Cinderella is such a kind and warm character it's impossible not to fall in love with her.

The Disney Channel sitcom stars' music video rendition of ""A Dream is a Wish"" was even worse than I expected, and that's pretty hard to do because I was expecting it to be terrible. Instead it was earpiercingly terrible. I don't think it's possible to destroy that song any more than they actually did. It literally made me feel like my ears were bleeding, and the way they sang it was just an insult to the elegant '50s style of the movie. The music video for ""Every Girl Can Be a Princess,"" however, was made exactly how I would have made it, using clips from all the Disney Princess movies. Of course, it would have been nice to see a little more since they did something I could have easily done myself, but you can't have everything.

The final feature on the first disk bored me to tears. It was an ESPN sports special about ""Cinderella stories"" in sports. They went through the biographies of various sports players and teams and fruitlessly attempted to compare them to Cinderella. It was just awful, and I think that disk space could have been put to much better use.

The second disk was mostly quality, but the 20-minute ""Living the Royal Life"" presentation and the 2-minute presentation from the Princess Party DVD also, in my opinion, could have been put to much better use. The first one was a special about Sally from Disney Channel's ""Mike's SuperShort Show"" trying on various ugly dresses, having professionals come make over her room, and being taught to curtsy by a real princess. It had absolutely nothing to do with Cinderella and was mostly pointless. I'd much rather have seen a 20-minute interview with Ilene Woods or more deleted storyboards to fill that space. The latter was a poorly made clip show of the Disney Princess movies with a singsongy voiceover aimed at 5-year-olds trying to get kids to mimic some of the qualities of the princesses. Pathetic.

I think my favorite part of this disk were the deleted songs, because there were just so many, and they were all terrific. I especially loved ""The Dress My Mother Wore,"" ""Dancing On a Cloud,"" and ""The Face I See at Night."" There were only two ""deleted scenes"" and I use the term loosely because they were both just deleted songs with storyboards to match. However, in ""The Cinderella that Almost Was,"" there are other deleted scenes and characters mentioned who did not appear in that section of the DVD. I would have liked to see the storyboards for those scenes in place of the two presentations mentioned in the above paragraph.

The galleries were nice, but there didn't seem to be much of a transition between the rough sketches and the final sketches of the characters. I guess they just knew what they wanted them to look like right away, though, which is fine. I also enjoyed ""The Art of Mary Blair"" featurette. It was very nice to hear about a female animation artist for a change.

It was also very nice to see that they put a little something together in tribue to the ""Nine Old Men,"" the nine men who did the most work in Disney's early classic animated features. I heard a lot about them in the Sleeping Beauty DVD, but they were only mentioned in passing and here there was a full 20-minute discussion about their lives and their work. They contributed a lot to Disney animation, so this tribute was very worthwhile and an excellent addition to the DVD.

The main feature on the DVD was the 40-minute ""Making of"" presentation, where they really got into the movie itself and the work that went into it. While it was a fascinating and well-made documentary, I do think it fell a bit short, and could have been longer if they had gotten rid of the ""Living the Royal Life"" feature. I did learn a lot about the movie from this, though, such as how they used live-action references for practically the entire film, and how it was the movie that saved Walt's company from going bankrupt. It did not, however, make up for the fact that there was no commentary on the movie itself. Come on! Even Snow White had a commentary and that was made in 1937!

Also, there were several ""vintage"" clips of television shows that were made in the 1950s to promote Cinderella. For some reason, watching these put a huge smile on my face. They just don't make TV specials like they did in the '50s any more and for better or worse, these are just incredibly amusing to watch. I don't know whether it's the cheesy old feel of it, or the genuine honesty and warmth that seemed to radiate from the hosts and the guests, but whatever it was, I really and truely loved watching the clips from ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" the Perry Como show, and the radio broadcasts with Ilene Woods.

Finally, there were three DVD-ROM games in which you can design your own princess castle, import your picture and design a gown, or design your dream room. Childish or not, these games were a lot of fun for me, and I think it offered enough options for the designs to not feel forced. I have to say that for the princess gown one, the hairstyles were all rather ugly, and the princess looks someone anorexic, but it was still a lot of fun because of all the options.

Overall, it was an excellent DVD, but it could have been even better. I think that if they had gotten rid of the sports special and added a commentary, and removed the ""Living the Royal Life"" and ""Princess Pajama Jam"" specials and replaced them with the deleted storyboards from ""The Cinderella that Almost Was"" and more interviews with Ilene Woods and some of the other people who worked on the film, it would be perfect. But hey, not everything ends happily ever after.",1128643200,,6065,4.54071363220494
86088,5,0788802194,"The DVD is great filled with stuff that they mentioned in the DVD features.

The one that's sold by Disney Store On-line contains one 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, mini-plush, character portraits, and frames. At the end, I chose the gift set although Amazon failed to mention what was included in the gift set. Today (10/07/05) the Disney Store also sells the gift set for 29.99. If you like Cinderella or want to find a gift for somebody, this is a great gift.",1128643200,,705,4.515625

The great Cinderella film, now available, is the l973 Czech version Theee Wishes For Cinderella. You won't find one singing or talking or silly animal -  only very real people with very real problems and a warm and wonderfully modren Cinderella. And is she a tomboy! At the outstanding conclusion, when the Prince w/slipper cannot find the heroine, Cinderella finds the Prince!!! And adults will love it as much as children.",1128556800,,587,5.051546391752577
86090,4,0788802194,"I love Cinderella and I think we can all agree it is a classic and the film is really grand in it's use of animation and of course the wonderful ideas presented by Mary Blair were a huge contribution to the film. I want to deal a little bit more on the Special Features side and stir up the suits at Disney a bit.

Collecting Disney animated films is a great hobby and I have been doing this even before DVD and I own many LaserDisc box sets that Disney has released over the years and we are talking 125.99 sets! (DVDs are far cheaper I don't want to hear from readers talking about how expensive some sets are on DVD. When you pay 125.99 for a DVD set of a SINGLE film then we will talk. These sets are not even have the cost. One of the best laserdisc sets that was released in 1995 was Cinderella,  housed in a elegant looking box. Most tasteful presentation! It really was a Special Edition with bonus features that were easy to dive into. Suddenly with DVD the executives at Disney I think have went through lengths thinking they are doing the great things by doing page to page artwork gallerys that I'm sorry to say is so badly executed. What happned to the SIMPLER WAY! Do a menu breakdown of what art work we will see backgrounds concept art etc and let us go through these images to our hearts content I don't care if there are 300 in that listing so be it. It is SO much easier than taking the time to look at say 10 of them then making the buyer have to go to the next ""gallery"" to see the next set. let us just forward to the next piece of art and let it flow. If you are older lovers of Disney you know what I am talking about. Every special edition uses this form of artwork presentation and it really is not fun and makes many just say forget it. Especially if they own the LaserDisc sets I would rather hang on to these sets to look at all the artwork it is 300 times easier.

Adding bonus features like Princess Pajama Jam parties or whatever is I have to say really REALLY cute but lets be really honest Who came up with that? Let us stick to the film and present it with special features that don't dumb it down. Take a Criterion type of approach better yet license them to Criterion and let them release a more adult Special Edition minus idiotic song rendetions of classic songs by Disney Channel artists. Include commentary tracks by worthy people like Canemaker and let them talk to us with all technical terms and not dumb things down. Let's hear about animation techniques and history. We don't even get any great secondary audio recordings hardly ever anymore of older Disney laser sets we were even given isolated score and sound effects tracks. Those days are gone.

It is all nice and fun to be very dramatic in the making of by saying it was the studios biggest gamble but come on I've been through it so much. It is fine to include that information but lets not push it you'd think the place was gonna explode back in 1949! Mention it but move on use some class.

Plus when you release a ""Gift Set"" it seems to want to cater to the more older Disney fan so why are you still including big but while I admit the artwork is wonderful lets add some great text not storybooks for children. Step up with some intellgence. When one pays SO MUCH MORE for a nice Box Set make it just that. They is no way the cost warrants the bargin bin goodies we recieve. The actual cover art on these sets like Cinderella - Lion King - and Aladdin are wonderful very nice job I'm sure Little Mermaid will be nice also. It seems these box sets feature a more refined cover art look like those great laserdisc box sets of before. Let's stick to that but give the buyer some goods! The film transfers are really great i would suggest not to rip out the original RKO Distribution title cards it sort of cuts the films and takes away form the presentation. Please include the Walt Disney Pictures log but then go into the films with the RKO intros. it is the correct presentation of the laserdisc release of 1995. I rate this film 5 statrs but I have to say the Special Gift Set Edition should only rate a 3 at most cause of lack of adult oriented bonus features and while they are included they seem to be more of a bother to access.

I hope people from Disney read this and take into consideration changes that would make their bonus features more worth while and not a waste of energy and time. and please stop degrading the original classics by releasing direct to video sequels that are only made to make a buck and cheapen the original films.",1128470400,9,4555,4.266203703703703
86091,5,0788802194,"Cinderella was originally released in 1950 by Disney. There have been at least 40 alternative versions of Cinderella released both before and since then, both animated and with live actors.

What sets Disney's version of 1950 apart?  It is the central role of the animated mice and birds, Lucifer the ever-scheming troublemaker of a cat, and Bruno, the loveable old hound who dreams of catching Lucifer. The mice and birds are constantly helping Cinderella compensate for the oppressive work overload assigned by her stepmother and two stepsisters. The mice have to overcome Lucifer's constant efforts to catch and eat them and to get Cinderella into horrendous trouble with her stepmother.

The basic Cinderella plot line serves merely as a frame holding a canvas on which these animal characters play out the main parts of the story line through their cat and mouse games.  It is these antics, communicated through short pidgin English phrases from the mice and deliciously evil facial expressions and body language of the cat, that endear the film so much to children and to the child in us all.

The setup menu offers 4 audio options:

-  English 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track

-  French 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track

-  Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track

-  Restored original monophonic sound track, which is Dolby Digital and includes both a center channel track and a sub-woofer track

To my ears, the new 5.1 channel English sound mix makes the mice's pidgin English conversations much shriller and much more muddied, so I found it harder to understand what the mice were saying than the restored original sound track, which is much clearer.

It's interesting that when the mice break out in song together, they sound much like the munchkins singing together in The Wizard of Oz, released 11 years earlier by MGM in 1939.

Cinderella was nominated for 3 Oscars in 1950, but lost to other films:

  Best Sound, Recording: lost to ""All About Eve"", 20th Century Fox Sound Dept.

  Best Music, Original Song; lost to ""Captain Carey, U.S.A."" song ""Mona Lisa"", Paramount

  (Cinderella was nominated for the song ""Bibbidy-Bobbidi-Boo"")

Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture: lost to ""Annie Get Your Gun"", MGM (starring Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley)

The only prize Cinderella won in 1950 was a special award at the Venice Film Festival in Italy. However, in the years since then Cinderella has won the hearts of children around the world for the special characters it brought to life, especially the mice Gus and Jacques and the cat Lucifer.

The mice Gus and Jacques as well as the dog Bruno were all voiced by James MacDonald, a Scot who was also the ""second voice"" of Mickey Mouse from 1946 to 1976 (Disney had several voice-over artists in its stable of Mickey Mouse voices).

Amazon.com's Editorial Review above of Disney's Cinderella mentions several other versions of this movie, such as the Rodgers & Hammerstein productions of 1957, 1965 and 1997, The Slipper and the Rose in 1976 starring Richard Chamberlain, Gemma Craven and Margaret Lockwood; Shelly Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre version in 1982 starring Jennifer Beals, Matthew Broderick, Jean Stapleton and Eve Arden; and Ever After in 1998 starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott.

Additional Cinderella films that one could mention include the 48-minute ""lite"" version from Goodtimes DVD (ASIN: B000069HPF), and the hilarious ""Cinderfella"" of 1960 (ASIN: B0002NY8SA) starring Jerry Lewis, in which he plays a persecuted stepbrother with an evil stepmother, and gets some help from his ""fairy godfather"" to meet a ""princess charming"" looking for a husband at a ball. The ""princess charming"" is played by the beautiful Anna Marie Alberghetti.

Among this funny film's special treats are a live jazz performance by Count Basie and his world renowned band, Jerry's inimitable jazz dancing, and a tremendous amount of physical comedy that is Jerry Lewis' trademark.

All these films serve to compliment, highlight and confirm the classic status of the one and only Disney Cinderella.",1128470400,7,4075,5.081203007518797
86092,5,0788802194,"Finally with this release, all of Disney's theatrical animated films have been released at some point on DVD.

86093,1,0788802194,"Why did Disney decide to change Cinderella's dress color from silver to blue?  The answer is $MARKETING$!!  They market Cinderella in a blue dress when the original color was a silver.  I turned back and forth from the VHS and the DVD.  Disney not only lost the original color of the dress during the ball and the escape from the ball scenes, but also lost the quality!  Her dress was more detailed and sparkled more in the original silver color.  The DVD makes her dress look like they painted by number!!!  I am very upset!!!!",1128384000,18,528,4.494736842105263
86104,3,0788802194,"Although this DVD is crisp and beautiful, it is a shame that Disney chose to alter the color of Cinderella's dress through out the ball scene. Her dress should be silver, as it is when her fairy godmother created it, and the color changes to blue in the moonlit scenes. But, in an effort to justify it's vast merchandising of a blue dressed Cinderella, Disney has chosen to alter the color in several indoor scenes, so that the dress is seen to be blue more often then silver. Why couldn't they just restore it correctly?",1128384000,7,521,4.494736842105263
86105,5,0788802194,"Disney has been getting big and Platinum lately, releasing movies than taking them quickly off the shelf. Due to lack of funds at the time, I missed out on Snow White and Beauty and the Beast. I got Cinderella first day, more for a sense of completion purposes but the film isn't bad of course, just to me isn't Bambi or the Lion King.

Cinderella is a beautiful woman with a very capable voice(just like Snow White and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty) who is basically the servant of her step-mother and step-sisters. Aided by furry pets(like Snow White), Cinderella tries to get to a ball where tons of unmarried maidens have to please a Prince just by appearing in front of him. Really weird message there. Don't even have to know the person, just beauty alone is enough.

Anyways, running away she runs into her Fairy Godmother and gets a fancy coach and shimmering dress and goes to the Ball only there's a catch: be back by midnight or everything will go back to normal. Realizing it's late, she runs home but loses one of her glass slippers. So it's trying to get her married while dealing with her evil women.

One problem I have as you might've noticed is the familiarity with past releases. The beautiful woman who can sing(the aforementioned women), her animal companions and someone jealous of their beauty(Snow White). Hell, there's even this bird whistle in the beginning that I swore I heard in Bambi and probably Snow White too.

The film is enduring though and the whole Cinderella belle of the ball idea is practically pop culture, along with the glass slipper. The animation of course is great with some nice detail although it does have that less sharp detail look like Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.

I'm just being critical of a film that really doesn't need to have flaws pointed out, it is a children's film after all. So get it, especially since Di$ney will take it off the shelves soon. FYI: the next 2 are Lady and the Tramp(February 2006) and The Little Mermaid(October 2006). Bring on Dumbo and Pinocchio.",1128384000,,2034,4.638888888888889

This new DVD Platinum Edition is outstanding. It is the best copy to be issued since the Laserdisc versions. The restoration is brilliant. The extras are truly extraordinary going far beyond some of the other recent Disney restored animated classics that have been issued. The Backstage material was very good. I liked the new digital 5.1 enhanced surround sound. It gave the film a whole new dimension of brilliance and emotional impact. I liked this new DVD immensely.,1128297600,8,635,4.834862385321101
86110,4,0788802194,"This story was originally animated during Disney's golden age. Absent trendy sidekicks, the storyline is fairly straight forward.

A young girl who is being abused by her cruel stepmother and stepsisters ultimately gets the chance to go to the ball through the aid of a fairy godmother. She quickly escapes the ball to avoid being recognized, but the prince tracks her down with a discarded glass slipper.

This version is packed with tons of interesting extras. There are two unused songs which never went into the film (I like Cinderella's work song) and two documentaries on the making of this classic. Perry Como himself summarizes the plot and there are some other related radio programs included.

Kids are going to prefer the music videos, and the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition featurrette where a young woman is turned into a princess. I understand this story has a very powerful impact for a certain generation, but think that a family film still ought to have more features for the kids to enjoy.

If you've seen the last VHS release, you'll be amazed by the brilliance of the colors in the opening credits alone. The difference is literally jaw-dropping, and it's a startling beauty carried through the rest of the film.

The Platinum Edition DVD is absolutely loaded with features, including some insights into the development process, and characters and songs that never made it to the silver screen. There are plenty of features geared toward the younger generation, including a music video by the Disney Channel's top stars and ""House of Royalty"" which will give girls a taste of how to live like a princess. (Parents note: If you have a young daughter, a trip to Home Depot and pink paint swatches may be in your future.) Showing a bit of whimsy, Disney also included ESPN's top list of ""Cinderella stories"". You can tell they had fun putting this edition together, and you'll have fun enjoying the result.

They crammed alot of information into the 15 minute documentary and it was GREAT!  The 9 OLD MEN segment was GREAT too.  GREAT to see BRAD BIRD (INCREDIBLES) talk about the guys who built Disney.  The film looks prestine and sounds GREAT too.  My only complaint is the cover.  This BAD Air brush art has to stop!  Why doesn't DISNEY use the original poster art that the DISNEY STUDIO took much care in creating...instead of using this CHEAP looking, badly airbrushed art that looks like a high school art student created?",1127779200,5,642,4.619469026548672
86113,5,0788802194,"(First off, thank you Amazon, that was very awesome of you!)

Cinderella is unique in its scope, and its all too obvious that Sir Walt was in love with it.

After watching the behind the scenes footage on Bambi, and listening to the archived audio footage of Disney himself having a round table discussion about the story, I hear ol' WD's voice when I watch any of his classic animations. ""Now Cinderella will be awakened by two chippery birds, but not before she has a little fun by thumping the nosey rascal on the tail... This flittery fellow pitches a fit..."" That's whats great about watching art created by a artist that love their work. Also imagine how the conversation about the character Gus must have been.

I don't care if you have been hiding under a rock for your entire life, you know what Cinderella is about, so I won't weigh you down with a synopsis.

What's important about Cinderella, is that she was a girl who in the end earned what she deserved. (Apparently, happily ever after awaits to be seen - Part III is coming in 2007) She wasn't a coward, and through even the worst of days with her extremely vile Stepmother and (fell off of the ugly/stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down - thanks m.d.) Stepsisters, she was respectful. It would be easy to think that she was just browbeaten, whipped into submission, but that is nowhere to be seen. Simply, she cares about those who despise her. And don't get me started on Lucifer.

Cinderella is a kids movie, yeah I know. The Anime fans I know believe anything Disney is the Devil, that's to be expected. (Miyazaki's titles are being released through Disney, think about it.) But there are some great lessons to be learned by all of us, kid or adult alike: Friendship, dreams, hope, never giving up (in Cinderlla's case until the Godmother gives her a pep talk, a pep song, and performs a few magic tricks) also the realities of goodness and plain ol' raunchy badness.

{SIDENOTE: Godmother = Deus Ex Machina for you students of film}

The Platinum Edition sparkles and is beyond reference material, its gorgeous. The sound couldn't be better. If you want a dts track, get a life. They started with Mono quality for Pete's sake! The new mix is all it should be. My only question: Why, or WHO rather, came up with the idea to put the Joe Namath feature on there. Not that its bad, not that it even makes sense, but man WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

As all movie trailers begin, ""In a World..."" where there is little to no clean entertainment for the children, this is a no-brainer. The only thing you will be disappointed about by purchasing this dvd is that you'll wish you could have had it when you were a kid.

The VHS, which until this ""first time ever"" DVD  release, was the only available format (out of print for some time) and pales in comparison. The restoration of both the Technicolor and sound is very apparent and beautifully done. The picture is sharp and the colors are vivid; they literally jump out at you. I was amazed. It's difficult to believe that this animated classic was made in 1950. I find it pointless to give a synopsis of this well-known story, but I'd rather commend the efforts of the Walt Disney Studio for producing a DVD which is worthy of a great Animation Studio. Earlier DVD efforts, such as ""Pinocchio"" and ""Dumbo"" were dismal. They were slapped together without the benefit of video/audio re-mastering or any extra materials. Disney has finally woke up and is giving their loyal consumers great DVDs by re-releasing their animated classics with Special Platinum Editions. ""Lady and the Tramp"" is scheduled for the Platinum treatment in February 2006, hope more will follow. The supplemental materials are plentiful and excellent, adding hours of further enjoyment.

An opportunity to sneak-preview the new Platinum Edition DVD of Disney's 1950 animated classic CINDERELLA recently presented itself, and this reviewer was so impressed with the quality and value that a critique seemed warranted.)

Who isn't already familiar with Disney's CINDERELLA (1950), the animated masterpiece that relates the tale of the pretty maid who, after suffering years of cruelty at the hands of her stepsisters and stepmother, goes to the Royal Ball and ends up marrying the Prince?  Yes, there's a lot of maudlin manipulation, saccharine storybook prettiness, and syrupy songs.  But the artwork and old-school animation are visually stunning, and before you know it--Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!--you're caught up in the fantasy of it all.

The new Platinum Edition 2-disc DVD--due for wide public release on October 4, 2005--makes it even harder to resist getting lost in this Disney classic.  The film itself has undergone a digital restoration that is, in a word, breathtaking!  No matter how many times you've seen CINDERLLA before, you'll feel like you're seeing it for the first time.  Imagery is sharper, colors are richer, and the virtual lack of filmic artifacts and other visual annoyances make the artistry of the film more aesthetically pleasing than ever.

In addition to the enhanced picture, the DVD also features a new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  (Purists, fret not--the option of viewing the film with the original theatrical soundtrack, beautifully restored, is available.)  There are also tons of bonus features, including a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, new music videos, games, and much more.  Whether you're seeking a restored piece of film history or looking for a night of family fun, this DVD set is well worth the price of admission.

In short, new Platinum Edition CINDERELLA 2-disc DVD is a five-star edition of a five-star animated classic.",1127692800,2,2018,5.4089456869009584

I bought Cinderella for me, myself! It's one of my Top 5 favorite movies, and has been at the top of my list since the first time I saw it at age five. OK! It's no ""Chinatown"" or ""Double Indemnity,"" but something happens to me when I hear, ""Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo - put them together and what have you got?"" A terrific feeling in your heart...a warmth deep down inside that spreads, and for a brief moment, actually for the length of the film - 76 minutes - the world is a beautiful, safe place filled with optimism and love and happily ever after! ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"" is not the Rolling Stones - but once I hear the tune, I go around singing it for days. Great cut! It doesn't drive me crazy. It makes me feel wonderful!

Walt Disney's adaptation of this glorious fairy tale, that as a feminist I should be dissing, is the best!

86153,5,0788802194,"We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right.

There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer.

There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying",1121731200,2,988,5.58
86154,5,0788802194,"Cinderella was a source of inspiration to me. She started off as a ""slave"" but ended up as a ""Princess"". Now how can you imagine people just turn like that?

I loved all the characters including the supporting characters who made so much contribution to the whole thing. The fairy Godmother made me think she was my own grandmother.

All the magic and love in this movie will really entertain families all over the world.

86158,5,0788802194,"Despite from what other reviews say, I am putting my 2 cents in here about this movie.

I loved this movie when I was young and I still love it and now since I have a 2 yr old child it makes it that much better for she LOVES the movie (have it on VHS)and it makes it more fun for a Mom and Daughter movie night together!!! For I wish it was Oct 4 so I can get it for her!  It is a fairy tale movie not an educational movie (as someone's review complained that it's not educational or giving the right message but I think they claim Shrek does)for it's kind of like what every little girl wants which is to find her Prince to live happily ever after.

This is one of the best Classic Animations that Disney has done along with Snow White.

 Also you expect for alittle girl wanting to have an ugly girl like one of the step sisters to marry the prince??? For girls love pretty Princesses not ugly ones.  They are Fairy tales for children to watch.  That's all and little girls are not watching it to find messgaes.  For what is a 2yr old like my daughter who loves this movie gonna pick up from it besides seeing a pretty Princess living happily ever after??",1117152000,6,1157,4.111111111111111

86161,5,0788802194,"This animated feature saved the Disney studio from almost cetain bankruptcy; there hadn't been a big hit since Snow White, and the studio was foundering, badly. Cinderella came along and put on the glass slipper and showed it to the world and the rest, as they say, is history. The songs from Cinderella have stayed with me all my life, and are a fixture I carry with me from many years ago when I saw this magical movie for the first time, my favorite being ""So This is Love..."" Cinderella contained a scene that Walt himself stated was his personal favorite of all from the wonderful features he created, and that is when Cinderella gets her dress from her Fairy Godmother. The dress, if you notice, is a color that literally defies description and really does seem to come from the magic wand of the FG; the entire scene is fantastic, the mice turned into beautiful, horses to pull the exquisite coach, created from a lowly pumpkin, that dances on it's vine over to the FG so she can transform it into the thing of splendor, the Fairy Coach. The stars and twinkles from the dress and the transformations are spectacular, and it is hard to imagine the meticulous detail the animators used to draw these fairy dust particles that add such enchantment to the scene. Cinderella's old horse becomes a buck-toothed coachman and is clearly delighted to be included in the excitement of the night. An actress/dancer named Ilene Woods was rotoscoped (a technique where the actors are filmed and then drawn over) for her part as Cinderella and it is her movements that became Cinderella's. The Wicked Stepmother is a great Disney Villain, voiced by Eleanor Audley, who later voiced Maleficent for Sleeping Beauty; her voice is fantastic, the perfect blend of sophistication and malevolence. When first seen in her vast bedroom, stroking the wretched cat Lucifer, she seems to be a real witch with her familiar, and her face remains in shadow for a time...The mice are wonderful little characters, the cutest, IMHO, is Gus-Gus, a tubby little guy Cinderella finds in a trap and rescues and gives him, as all her little mice friends have, tiny clothes including shoes. Lucifer the cat is dreadful, such a bad kitty you dislike him all the way, and Bruno, Cinderella's old hound dog saves the day and sends Lucifer to his just reward. Jacques, the lead mouse, is the real hero, and saves the day at a critical point toward the end. There is a wonderful scene of the King lamenting his son's lack of a suitable wife to the Grand Duke, another great and very amusing character, and yearns for grandchildren while looking at portraits of the Prince from childhood up until the present day, and as the Prince gets older, the portraits get bigger and bigger and the last one is so enormous it has to hang in a castle of truly magnificent and royal proportions.
This is the all-time classic fairy tale, originally written by Charles Perrault, who also wrote Sleeping Beauty, another of my favorite Disney classics in ever sense of the word. I have this on VHS, and have watched it too many times to count; and now I cannot even imagine how beautiful and rich the colors will be on DVD; I cannot wait to get my copy and look forward to many viewings of this wonder that saved the Disney stuido from disaster, for the unending benefit of all of us children, from infants to 100+ year olds.

Her only friends are the animals she takes care of, except for Lucifer, the mean old cat.
It is made known that the Prince is looking for a bride.  The animals help Cinderella by creating a beautiful gown from an old dress.  When the step-sisters become jealous of how beautiful Cinderella looks, they rip her dress to shreds and leave her to stay home while they attend the ball.  This is where Cinderella's Fairy Godmother steps in and creates a nite worth remembering for her.

Cinderella is pretty, graceful and easy to sympathize with , against her evil stepmother and revolting stepsisters, and her wonderful cute animal friends are done perfectly , in a way in which does Disney proud.
There is a lot of humor as well as the heartbreak of Cinderella, due to the evil step relatives who have usurped her home and fortune, and have subjected her to slavery.
For example, I won't forget the look of disgust on the Grand Dukes face when one of the hideous stepsisters wrinkles up her face and awkwardly greets him, in an attempt to ingratiate herself.
However the abrupt ending is indeed disappointing, as seeing the evil stepmother and step sisters punished is something we where all looking forward to, an integral part of the tale, which was left out.

Now, I don't expect a children's cartoon to follow the Grimm's fairytale version (where the stepmother and sisters are blinded by doves,) but to just let the bad guys off the hook does not make a very satisfying story.

This favorite Disney classic has enchanted generations of children. It has the message that if you dream, your dream can come true.

""A dream is a wish your heart makes."" --Cinderella sings

Cinderella lives in a run down house and sleeps up in the tower. The view of the king's castle is like a beacon of hope for her. Hope for something in the future gives children meaning in life and promotes optimism. They can also relate to the sibling rivalry between the sisters!  The cat is just so naughty and the mice adorable.

Cinderella also sees the good in life. Even though she has to clean, cook and is basically the maid in her own home, she still even finds good in life and even the evil cat, Lucifer. While she is washing the floor, she sings and bubbles float in the air. Each bubble carries an image of her scrubbing the floor and the harmony is just beautiful as you hear many voices (all hers) singing.

The pumpkin transformation is my favorite part and Cinderella's dress is just sparkling. I never noticed it before but there is sparkling everywhere like diamond dust. It really adds a touch of magic to this enchanting story. Perfect for October!  Even at 33, I still love this movie.
