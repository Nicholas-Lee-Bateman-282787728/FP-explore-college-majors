2467570,5,B000CO7I9A,"I haven't even seen this set and am primed to get it!! A great afternoon adventure series from the '50s finally comes to DVD!! There have been some cheap single episode DVDs circulating with questionable video/audio quality. If this set compares well with the Superman sets, it will definitely be worth the purchase. NOW!! When will the Rin Tin Tin series be released? (YOOO RINNYY!!!)",1146096000,11,385,4.938461538461539
2467571,5,B000CO7I9A,"I just thought I'd let everyone know that this set is available at deepdiscountdvd.com. From what I've read here and at tvshowsondvd.com, the audio and video is really great. It sounds like these episodes are uncut also (which is a big plus with me!). If you buy this set, please come back and let the rest of us know what you think.

UPDATE: Just got my DVD set in and I have but one word to say ---- WWWOOOOWWW! The audio and video quality is amazingly good!! The only complaint I have is that the disc holders are cheap and flimsy. When I first opened the set, I pulled out disc 1 and the disc itself was already loose in the plastic case so be careful. The case centers don't seem to hold the disc in place very well. I will probably have to replace them with better ones. After seeing (and owning) previous discs of this show that looked horrible, this set is a very welcome addition. The picture quality is excellent. The colors are fantastic, especially Preston's bright red uniform. If you are a fan of this show or know someone who is, don't hesitate to buy this set!",1137628800,26,1076,4.353233830845771
2467572,5,B000CO7I9A,"Great video and sound quality, much better than I had dared to hope for.  This is the holy grail for Sergeant Preston fans.  Just buy it!",1136851200,23,137,4.230769230769231
2467573,5,B000CO7I9A,"Like The Lone Ranger, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon has been of special interest to me.  This is one of the few earlier TV series to be filmed all in color and was done or produced first class.  Their production values were several steps higher than most other production companies.  The writers and producers put together a series that taught the younger generation about morals, respect and ritht from wrong.  The company that brought back this series on DVD did a magnificent job in restoring these to a DVD format as the audio and video view like this is newly produced series.",1215820800,3,581,4.666666666666667
2467574,4,B000CO7I9A,It brings me back to a time when there were a lot of fun and wholesome series on Saturday morning TV that appealed to youngsters.,1209945600,2,129,4.2

2467576,4,B000CO7I9A,"1950s TV series about a Mountie and his beloved dog, set in the late 1890s Yukon Gold Rush. Think wild woolly western travelling lawman with plenty of snow (the cold and wet kind) and no female companionship whatsoever. Richard Simmons stars as the requisite handsome mustachioed Mountie, derivative of the 1930-1950 Challenge of the Yukon Radio series. Small parts were actually filmed outdoors. There are dogsleds, steamships, telegraphs, Eskimoes, Indians, plus French and English speaking Canadians. Not quite the usual Classic Western, but produced by the same people who did The Lone Ranger. Fun series.",1178928000,,609,5.421052631578948
2467577,5,B000CO7I9A,It was very entertaining and the quality was good. It brought back memories from when I was a kid. It was one of the best christmas presents!,1169164800,3,141,4.2592592592592595
2467578,5,B000CO7I9A,"Yes, this is a fantastic set. I give Critics Choice Video 5 stars for this and other sets they have released. The quality is excellent and it is so nice to see a company release so much of the older television shows like they are doing. I've bought lots of there DVD's and have not been disappointed with any of them. Just check out the 2nd season of Sgt. Preston also and both volumes of the Hopalong Cassidy television shows. These are all classic stuff and the quality of all is Excellent.",1168992000,4,492,4.358695652173913
2467579,5,B000CO7I9A,"Sargent Preston of the Yukon is a show I remembered from my many hour of tv sitting! I spent to many hour in front of tv watching nearly everything tthat was on!

  I remember Sargent Preston with great fondness! The actor who played the part of Sargent Preston just looked the part and played the role very streight! Not like some other kiddie shows!

  Even now this show hold up very well! The company that is putting the show out on DVD, did a ooutstanding job of cleaning up the image! The colors ar3e great as well as the sound! Ther might be a very few scratch marks that pass quickly but over all the quality is graaand!

  To put it simply athe show is just plain fun!

  Relive your childhood and order these shows!",1166313600,2,725,4.288888888888889
2467580,5,B000CO7I9A,"It was with much trepidation I ordered this box set of Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Previous purchases on the Critics Choice label, who specialise in cheap public domain releases of mostly poor quality material had made me very wary.

My misgivings however turned to delight when I viewed this. It appears Critics Choice have actually obtained rights to the original master prints & the quality is really superb for a 50 year old series. Both colours & sound are crisp & clear & the nature of the program (being outdoors with a lot of greenery or snow)emphasises this. Preston in his bright red coat looks superb.

The stories are pretty simple with good triumphing over evil & few shades of grey. Nevertheless they are enjoyable & would have had a lot of appeal to kids growing up in the 50's. Even if the plots are a little thin at times your eye is constantly taken by the bright colour & scenery.

The episodes are grouped on 5 discs each in a slimline case,the only minor criticism being the rather dull box & photo but this won't detract from your enoyment of the series.

Critics Choice have already released Season 2 with Season 3 to come so you can collect the whole run.

They have also released the 52 Hopalong Cassidy TV episodes & though in monochrome the quality here is excellent also.

Hopefully they may become a major source of old hard to find series in good quality !",1158019200,7,1389,4.536
2467581,5,B000CO7I9A,"This is a excellent series that is in color,which is unusual for

early Television. The stories are excellent. I can't wait for season two and three to be availiable.",1156809600,2,166,4.724137931034483
2467582,5,B000CO7I9A,"I had several episodes of this tv series with horrible picture quality, so I was elated when I got this set.  Picture and color are pristine!

Anyone who loved the radio show will love the tv series. Richard Simmons WAS Sgt. Preston and the tv show is as much fun as the radio show.  The producers had the foresight to film the show in color (in 1955 color tv was virtualy nonexistent) and the scenery (filmed in Colorado) is gorgeous.",1150070400,17,435,4.4125

8099833,5,B000CO7I9A,"Brilliant TV series that brings back fond memories from my childhood days. I had been hunting for this show for many years and even though this package is Spanish it is easy to select the original english spoken version and go on to all the episodes. When I watched this on Australian television we only had B&W TV's back then, and it has been a super treat for me to actually see this in glorious and brilliant colour. My wife is ten years my junior and she has never seen this show before, and it didn't take long for her to get hooked. She loves King the dog and Rex the thoroughbred horse that Sergeant Preston rides on the first three discs. The episodes on the last two discs are all set in winter, and there are a lot of actual Yukon country shown in those episodes, with loads of dog sled team action and chases...Love it.",1449792000,,830,4.292993630573249
8099834,5,B000CO7I9A,My husband and I enjoy this show immensely.  It's great to be able to watch it when we want.  Works well.,1413072000,,105,3.9523809523809526
8099835,4,B000CO7I9A,"The quality of this set is revelation compared to other DVD sources. If you haven't viewed the Critics Choice (or the same by Infinity) collections of this series you are sorely missing out.

However, the episode names on several discs are in the wrong order, and/or mislabeled. Does anyone have a correct running order (for both season 1 and season 2)?",1396396800,,353,4.786885245901639
8099836,4,B000CO7I9A,Unfortunately not every episode is a pristine copy but highly enjoyable.  Season divides into a summer and winter sections.  Richard Simmons in excellent in the role.,1369180800,,166,5.346153846153846
8099837,5,B000CO7I9A,"On German TV there was ""Rin Tin Tin"" followed by ""Cheyenne"" and ""Bronco"", then came ""Sergeant Preston"" which I liked even more.
I'm very happy that the entire series is available on DVD!!!

I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,,1031,5.0588235294117645

8099839,5,B000CO7I9A,"We couldn't be more pleased with this great series from the Golden Age of Television, what's not to like?, we have the hero Sergeant Preston in his glorious red uniform traveling the wild trails of the 1890's Yukon Territory with his trusty and loyal pal, Yukon King, tracking down and capturing the gold robbers in each episode. Also most enjoyable are the wonderful winter epsiodes with Sergeant Preston leading a team of sled dogs( On you Huskies!!!) led by King. Although all the story plots are very simple, this nonetheless makes for great family entertainment for kids from ages 3-90.

Sergeant Preston is also the ultimate role model, especially for the young boys who were probably glued to their TV sets each week when this series aired in the 1950's. He is loyal , trustworthy, honest and a man with high moral character. (What a shame we have today's generation of children growing up with no role models such as Sergeant Preston to look up to).

Anyone who likes good old fashioned( and clean) family entertainment should not hesitate to buy this series.",1244851200,6,1067,4.825136612021858

If you remember watching this on tv way back when, or are just a fan of tv Western series, this Sergeant Preston set is the mother-lode! Beautiful transfers of exciting B-Western fare! You really need this, Super-highly recommended!!!!",1237680000,3,346,5.3090909090909095
