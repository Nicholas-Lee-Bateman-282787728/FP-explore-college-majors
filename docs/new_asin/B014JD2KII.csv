8730958,5,B014JD2KII,"One has to love a concert that opens up new music vistas.  I was totally unaware of the Beaux Arts Trio or Menahem Pressler.  After hearing this concert and watching the documentary on Pressler's life I went out and bought a number of the Beaux Arts CDs.  Wow -- a new world of music -- the piano trio format is new to me but lovely to listen to.  The New Year's Eve Program was fun to watch -- clearly Simon Rattle, the orchestra and the audience were having a great time.  Many of the pieces were unfamiliar to me but enjoyable.  The video was clear with good color saturation.  The sound was fine.",1500768000,,600,4.256637168141593

8730960,4,B014JD2KII,"The emphasis of this disc is firmly centred on Menahem Pressler, the nonagenarian now embarking upon a solo career having previously disbanded the famous and highly respected Beaux Arts Trio after a normal lifetime of music making at a high level.

The bonus feature of the disc therefore is a 45 minute documentary, The Life I Love. In this Menahem Pressler describes his life in both an historical context and as a performing and teaching musician. Importantly to himself he lays great stress is laid upon his performance criteria and how that has affected, and continues to inform, every note that he plays. Essentially his key belief is that one must love everything that one plays and that this love must be found in and realised from the music being played at any one time.

This priority has a considerable effect upon his interpretive results as witnessed within this disc. The performances of the Mozart concerto and the Chopin Nocturne have very little to do with currently perceived ideas of authentic performing considerations. The music is constantly inflected with rubatoes and small hesitations that make the interpretation very individual and personal and it is that personal element which so obviously connects with the audience and musicians in the Philharmonie. This then is music making that has no real parallel and it is on those terms that it must be accepted and enjoyed.

The remainder of the disc completes a popular program as befits the occasion. The one item that will be unfamiliar to many listeners is Rameaus suite from Les Indes Galantes. This 5 movement set of dances is presented on modern instruments within a reduced orchestra but the whole effect with burnished modern trumpets is clearly some distance from an authentic sound. This is a very enjoyable experience regardless. The Dvorak and Brahms orchestral dances are played with customary Berlin panache as is the reduced Hary Janos suite, which inexplicably lacks the Battle and Defeat of Napoleon.

The absolute orchestral highlight of the disc though is the Lezginka dance from Khatchaturians Gayaneh which is the encore to end the occasion. It is in this piece that Rattle and his orchestra really let their hair down figuratively and the piece lifts so far off the ground as to almost stratospheric!

Overall therefore this is a joyous occasion with sterling, if somewhat idiomatic performances of the solo items, and which is delivered with excellent HD imaging with crisp detail and realistic colour depth. The visuals are complemented with equally fine HD master Audio in 5.0 as well as a stereo option. Sub-titles in English, German and French are provided for the documentary which is essentially in German.

This disc will appeal greatly to those who warm to Menahem Presslers deeply felt playing as the centre piece of an enjoyable occasion.",1447459200,2,2844,5.053304904051172
