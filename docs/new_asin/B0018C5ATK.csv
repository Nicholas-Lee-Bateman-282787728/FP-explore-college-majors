8269368,5,B0018C5ATK,"I just saw this video a few minutes ago and it brought tears to my eyes. My family didn't come on the ship; we flew in and arrived at Camp Kilmer on Christmas Eve 1956. It was a historical and positive experience. Since then I have grown to become an American and love this country. It's sad how the current generation of immigrants is not as humble as the refugees of the past. For those that want a little taste of their Hungarian American heritage or perhaps were actually there, this video is a sentimental journey. My good friend Cornel is the teenager playing the piano on the ship. If you're a Hungarian American then this is worth having and passing on to your children. God Bless America!",1299196800,,697,4.453125
