8370491,3,B002HREYSS,"This is not what I had expected.  I thought I was receiving a performance video, this was a biography, sort of, about Yasmina Ramzy and her dance school in Toronto.  I would have liked to see more performances, instead of little snippets, or more on her class techniques than was included.  If you are thinking of taking classes from her, I recommend watching this dvd first, otherwise I would skip it and try to find some performance dvds of her and her ensemble.",1254873600,,464,4.566265060240964
