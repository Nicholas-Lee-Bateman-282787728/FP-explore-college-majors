7295428,5,B00ZVC2R0S,"""I Knew it was You"" is a touching, informative, and inspiring doco. I'm an acting student and watched it in a class at school and bought it for a friend as a birthday present but I will definitely have to buy another copy for myself to own!!!",1320105600,,242,4.170212765957447
7295429,5,B00ZVC2R0S,"I loved this documentary. It was well done and the extended interviews are the real meat of this production which runs about 45 minutes, with extras it is over an hour. The amount of information about this wonderful actor is enlightening and shows the tragedy of this man's short life.  Given that Pacino and Gene Hackman and other younger actors who didn't work with him speak so highly of the actor who played Sal in Dog Day Afternoon and Fredo in The Godfather movies, makes a very real life case that this was a genius who was taken from us. I cannot think of a better documentary about the insights into great acting. My only hope is that this brief piece of film inspires filmgoers to really see fine acting not just in the movies, but in the avant garde where Cazale lived, as shown by the delightful film shot by Fluxus artist Peter Moore, The American Way (also included in full in this package). Bravo to the makers of this work!",1292198400,11,939,4.459302325581396
7295430,4,B00ZVC2R0S,"I was very excited about this documentary and looked forward to it...but was immediately sad when it loaded into my player today to note that it is NOT 105 minutes but a few seconds under 40 minutes.  The other hour is taken up with bonus features of varying quality, interest and unless you are a super fan hard to sit through and doubtful to watch a second time. A rambling extended interview with Al Pacino ..another with Israel Horovitz, an obscure black and white short he acted in and another he manned the camera on...

What we have is a 40 minute documentary that features clips from 5 legendary films we are all familiar with and loads of talking heads...which is interesting but at 20 bucks I can't rate this a five star DVD given what you can buy for $20 in DVDs these days....at $10 I would rate this a 5 star DVD.  Even at only 40 minutes the talking heads kind of get repetitive in their praise for his ability to hit that one note he did so well , pathetic,tragic and sad.  It is a lovely (albeit short) tribute to a very beloved and often forgotten actor.  This would make a terrific bonus feature on one of the movies he acted in but as a stand alone its over priced.",1289260800,10,1184,4.291479820627803
7295431,5,B00ZVC2R0S,"Is there another actor that so completely defines a generation of great filmmaking ? When one considers the art of film and acting its impossible not to be moved in someway by the brilliant work of John Casale .
This documentary examines the life of an actor who completely takes his audience by the hand and makes the journey possible . Casale provided a subtle and complete counter balance to the fine acting of more histrionic players like De Niro ,Streep,Hackman ,Brando , Duvall and of course Pacino .

A remarkable career that included six of the greatest movies of all time Casale portrayed moody and often unlikable characters but with such elegance and range that one cannot help but feel his journey .

John Cazale stands with the elite character actors like Lee J. Cobb and John Gielgud and this fine documentary shares memories of his costars and fellow filmakers who apprieciate the nuance of such work .

A fitting tribute and celebration of one of the finest and tragically short careers in film .",1282348800,31,1012,4.738636363636363

7295441,5,B00ZVC2R0S,"Without getting very into depth, I am just very happy when easily forgotten faces get the credit their due. There are the superstars, and then there are unassuming masters of nuance. John Cazale was just that.",1448755200,,209,4.833333333333333
7295442,4,B00ZVC2R0S,"**BE AWARE that if you rent or buy the digital version of this, you will not get to see the extras that some of the reviewers here referred to (such as extended interviews and a short film). Those are only included on the DVD. The documentary that is streamed here from Amazon is only 40 min.

With that being said, I did enjoy the film but felt that it should've been longer. It feels like an abridged portrait of his life and work. Perhaps I would've been satisfied with the extra features that come with the DVD, but without seeing them, I can't say. Because of it's short length and not being the most in depth of documentaries, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I've been in love with John Cazale since I was a teenager and first saw him in Dog Day Afternoon, so I was really excited when I recently heard about this movie. I've been a huge movie fanatic since my teens and he has been in my top favorite actors ever since.  I remember fervently seeking out every movie John Cazale had ever done and how shocked and saddened I was when I learned that his life had been cut short at such a young age. The 5 films he was in are all films that I've watched dozens of times (except for The Deer Hunter... I've only seen that a few times as it's pretty long and brings with it a hefty emotional load).

There is some great commentary from some of the actors and directors who worked with Cazale: Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman, Robert De Niro John Savage and Meryl Streep (of whom was in, what seemed to be, a very loving relationship w/Cazale all the way until his untimely demise of lung cancer at 42). It stands to reason that he was hugely influential to, not just his colleagues and contemporaries, but probably also countless actors to come after him. Also interviewed are a few of those who most likely have taken a page from the Cazale school of acting book and who are also immensely talented in their own right  (Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Rockwell). They've become some of the best actors of my generation and it's wonderful to hear them talk about Cazale's influence. For obvious reasons, it's also very bittersweet to see and listen to Philip Seymour Hoffman, an equally brilliant actor who's life and, hence, career, was cut all too short.

I wish that all of the interviews had been longer, especially from his friends and family and those who worked with him.
You don't get a very thorough picture of his personal life, his background and what possibly shaped him. It just made me sad that his life and work are pared down to just 40 minutes. Just like his life, this film was much, much too short But, again, perhaps more depth is revealed in the extended interviews...
""Cut short"" seems to be a running theme to this review!
Anyway, all in all, I'm happy that someone took the time to honor John Cazale's life and his brilliance as an actor and whether or not you're a fan or have just discovered him, this movie is worth the time.",1446163200,7,2996,4.418478260869565

He started out with frosting, but pretty soon he was using custard, jelly, and creme.  Thank you John Cazale for making my morning more fulFILLing!!!  Great, totally recommend!",1437091200,,299,4.6923076923076925
7295446,4,B00ZVC2R0S,"Great in-depth documentary about this singular actor's actor who appeared in some of the most important movies of the late 20th Century. His untimely demise robbed the movie going public of who knows how many great performances.  Featuring great interviews with Cazale's heavyweight co stars and early Broadway / Hollywood friends such as Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro which are as much an insight into them as the subject.  Great for hard core movie buffs (such as myself) or students of acting.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  Excellent extra features  (more interviews and Cazale's early short films), and terrific packaging too.",1420156800,,634,5.3
7295447,5,B00ZVC2R0S,"John Cazale, a brilliant actor, died much too soon.  He made six films & ALL of them were nominated for the academy award.  This documentary explores his career & his personal life.  It's sharp, it's witty, it gives wonderful insight into what made him a legend in such a short time.  There are many interviews with those who knew him best & worshiped him as a man & as a giant of stage & screen.  It gives one pause, wondering what he could have done if he had only lived a longer life.  See this film",1396742400,2,502,4.177083333333333

Just shy of 40 minutes, it doesn't fill a feature-film slot, but it's the right length for the material.  Not sure why Amazon lists the running time as 104 minutes, it's actually 39.
