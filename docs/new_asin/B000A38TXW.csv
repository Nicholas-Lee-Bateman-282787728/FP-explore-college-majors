8073879,4,B000A38TXW,"After watching the film ""Lumpia"", I had to give the DVD ""Lumpiapalooza"" a chance.

  From the creators of ""Lumpia"", a concert in San Francisco on April 16, 2004 featured many Filipino and Asian American artists in a one night only event that features a lot of suspense with the attempt to reunite 90's Filipino artist, Buffy with her dance group, the Kandee Girls.

  I have to admit that the reunion segment (or the attempted reunion) was one of the major considerations of buying this DVD because Buffy was the girl, that I listened to back in my college days.  Yeah, Jocelyn Enriquez was hot but Buffy and the Kandee Girls, oh that was so much hotter.

  That was until Buffy mysteriously called it quits from the music industry.

  With an e-mail to her her label and a goodbye, Buffy was hot and all of a sudden, she removes herself from the radar.

  Heck, no one knows why they broke up or what happened and to see Patricio, Francesca and friends do what they can to unite Buffy and the Kandee girls together was just fun to watch.

  The DVD is split up into different parts.  Focusing on the concert, music videos by several artists and of course, ""A Band Reunited"" (The Search for Buffy and the Kandee Girls"".

  What I enjoyed about ""Lumpiapalooza"" was the diversity of music presented.

  As a Pinoy, there was a time when the majority of the bands I would see performing were girl and boy bands.

  I have no problem with that but I definitely want to see a variety of Filipino talent and on this DVD you will see a combination of dance and rock groups.

  The DVD features performances by StereoStaR FM, Lyrikal Beatz, Natalise, DJ Swift Rock, The Outsiders, Alaja, IF, 6th Day, Golda Supanova, marQue, PHUZ and Next Phaze.

  Music videos shown were by TheSpeaks, titofelix, Knowa Lazarus, the Skyflakes and InnerVoices.

  As for special features, the DVD features multi-angle performances of 6th Day and Golda Supanova.  A music video jukebox and more.

  Again, for me, the most exciting part of this DVD was to see the attempt of getting Buffy together with the Kandee Girls.

  But if there was any disappointment, it was that we see the label have their say.  We see most of the Kandee girls (one of the members had to go to the Philippines for a family emergency) but unfortunately, no Buffy.

  I wonder if we will ever find out why she left music behind.

  But nevertheless, I give the Lumpiapalooza crew an applause for attempting this VH1-esque type of adventure.

  All in all, I'm supportive of seeing more events promoting Filipino talent, especially talent from the US.

  I'm not sure if Lumpiapalooza was a one time event but I really liked the vibe of this event.  Very different from what we would see at the Filipino festivals or a Filipino club's college performance at Asian week.

  I just feel that an event spotlighting a multitude of diverse bands is just awesome.

  I think for many Filipinos, we have been quite fixated on what's on The Filipino Channel that a few tend to forget that we have a good number of talent here in the US and ""Lumpiapalooza"" does a great job in bringing them all together.  Definitely, check out the DVD!",1218585600,,3176,4.595323741007194
