5926391,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"WOW! If you like jazz, swing and 30s-40s style you should love this concert. Video is excellent and the sound is mixed well. Also, just a great show and concert. Check it out, she's going to be huge when she gets promoted in the US.",1398297600,,232,4.177777777777778
5926392,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"I am in the American military and discovered Caro Emerald here on the local German radio.  I love her jazz style and her songs.  Her material is so good and sounds just like old Jazz standards, even though they are not.",1391385600,,219,4.317073170731708
5926393,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"My husband heard one of Caro's songs playing in a hotel on our recent trip to the UK. He went on U tube and listened to more of her music.
He asked Santa for one of her albums for Christmas.  We are both hooked on her music now.  Such talent!",1389744000,,242,3.82
5926394,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"Enthusiastic Performance

This lady makes it look like she is having a good time and as much fun as the audience.  Great performance and looks more like play than it does hard work which I'm sure is required to pull off a great concert.  Musicians are terrific!",1389744000,2,261,4.51063829787234
5926395,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"5 stars for sound quality.  5 stars for video quality.  5 stars for performance.  Regardless of type of music, I'm always looking for recordings that make my sound system sound good.  This Blu-ray excels in all categories.  Plus, the performance is very enjoyable.  I had never heard of Caro Emerald until I watched this concert at a local home theater installer's studio through a state-of the-art sound system.  I immediately ordered the disc and enjoyed it just as much on my much less expensive home sound system.  The style of music is different, but it left me anxiously awaiting the next song.  If I were the recording engineer, I would have brought Caro's vocals into better focus in a few of the tracks, but in most cases, her vocals are just about perfect.  Whatever style of music you prefer, I think you will enjoy this performance.",1388534400,3,844,4.719178082191781
5926396,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"Great recording, very entertaining. Caro is fantastic and surely on her way to become a worldwide superstar.
Very highly recommended!",1388275200,,133,5.7
5926397,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"Brilliant photography, the sound - wow. . Overwhelmed.  Have ordered many videos from amazon, but this one has been the best overall for sound quality and visual. Wow.  Thanks. W. Bentley. Oregon",1385510400,6,195,5.0625
5926398,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"Let's start this by saying I prefer rock and this is NOT rock.  It is hard to categorize (Retro JazzSwing?).  There are jazz influences, some swing influences with a retro 40's feel, but very contemporary (the band contains a DJ).  Caro has a great voice backed with a tight band and singing fun songs.  I think she will be huge if she ever makes it to this side of the pond and gets exposure on the talk show/SNL circuit.",1381104000,12,422,4.30379746835443

5926400,5,B00EKGX7ZK,"What a treat this is.  If you are already a fan of Caro Emerald and her music, then you need this video of a concert she performed in London not too many years ago.  The sound quality is excellent and the video work professionally done.  Watching this, I got caught up in the excitement that evidently ran through the crowd in the hall.  Ms. Emerald and her band put on such a great show that evening -- it's nice to be able to share in the experience now.  And, of course, Caro Emerald herself looks so beautiful on stage.  If you are not yet a Caro Emerald fan, check out her many videos on YouTube.  You will even find cuts from this London concert.  Enjoy those, then buy this DVD to see the entire thing anytime.",1432944000,2,717,4.220588235294118
5926401,5,B00EKGX7ZK,Having recently discovered Caro Emerald I was more than pleasantly surprised at how talented she is. This Bluray is absolutely great. i.e. performance and audio/video quality.  Her blend of jazz with a slight hip-hop flair is flawless. If you're feeling a little down this will pick you up.,1427760000,,290,5.041666666666667

5926403,4,B00EKGX7ZK,I mistakenly ordered the BlueRay version and cannot play it because I do not have a BlueRay player. But I love Caro Emerald - great jazzy caberet type music and a great clear voice.,1423008000,,181,4.352941176470588
5926404,4,B00EKGX7ZK,The audio is a bit funky on this dvd. The band is just a little louder then her :( She's amazing live so I don't know what happened.,1420848000,,132,3.75
5926405,5,B00EKGX7ZK,Amazing DVD!,1420761600,,12,5.5
5926406,4,B00EKGX7ZK,"I love Caro Emerald, and this is a great performance. It sounds lovely, and the video is great too. A couple of nitpicks though. It's a video DVD, not a DVDA, so you'll need to use the on-screen menu to navigate to audio options, and then play the disc. A little annoying if you just want to pop it in and play.  The 5.1 mix is... pretty worthless. The rear channels are low volume and just muddy. There is no discrete audio, it's just a quad-stereo effect in the rear channels. Which is a shame, because they could have put instruments where they're supposed to be, or at the very least put the audience clapping in the rear channels.

That being said, the selection and quality of the DVD is exceptional.",1418601600,3,706,4.3816793893129775

8606372,3,B00EKGX7ZK,"As usual, Caro Emerald's performance is top notch. The sound, however, is not good. The surround mix is just horrible. The two channel mix is better, but is bested by dozens of YouTube clips.",1482364800,,191,4.647058823529412
