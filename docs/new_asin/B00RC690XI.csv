Also, as this DVD only contains the intros, station breaks, etc., not the films, it becomes a bit dull to watch back to back. BUT, I have such fond memories of Dr. Paul Bearer & Channel 44's Creature Feature, it was still worth the money.  I'm a huge horror & sci-fi fan, so I love the old horror hosts, and wouldn't miss a Saturday night with Svengoolie! If you're a die-hard fan, or grew up with Creature Feature, it's worth adding to your library. If you're not & just want to be entertained, this probably isn't for you.",1482796800,,590,4.267857142857143
