8451999,3,B0050WLWVO,"I am a big fan of cooking videos and I feel like I often learn something or get some good ideas when watching them. That was the case here. Tom Small, the presenter on this disk, is head chef at what looks like a suburban Italian restaurant. He shows you how to make some very tasty Italian dishes at home. Nothing is complicated and the ingredients will all be found at your local supermarket. Inside the disk case there is a removable list of ingredients for all the recipes so that you can take it along to shop for them without having to first play the disk and write them down yourself.

This is one disk in a series of four,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dare-To-Cook-Seasonal-Italian-Cuisine-4-Disc/dp/B008DKHOFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dare To Cook, Seasonal Italian Cuisine (4-Disc)</a>, and this one focuses on winter dishes. I liked several things presented here, but found it especially interesting when he made a sort of small porchetta from a pork tenderloin with garlic and sage.

As to what else is included, there are choices for each of several courses in a full Italian meal. There is a goat cheese appetizer. There are a couple of salads, including one with mussels and olives. As to pasta there is a bolognese and a vegetable lasagna. Along with the pork tenderloin, there is a nice lemon chicken as  main course.

I was lucky enough to find this at my local library. I enjoyed watching it and will probably make some of the dishes presented. It's the first time I've seen someone prepare giardiniera, a sort of Italian pickle mixture, though I have seen it in the international section of my supermarket. His flourless chocolate cake was also very interesting and looked quite tasty.

There is a fairly short list of recipes here but everything presented was done very well. Still, including a few dishes more would have been nice, and it would have also been nice to have printable recipes included along with the videos.",1341273600,,1992,5.006042296072508
