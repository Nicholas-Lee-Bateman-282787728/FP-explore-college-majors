I must admit, that I figured that I would've liked to check this out, for no other reason than to see the pilot action figure come flying out of the cockpit and then crash, falling, Not floating, to the floor. lol",1320537600,,380,4.442857142857143
4855407,5,B005OZJE8K,"I really loved watching every episode in the 80's and I have to say they were incredible. Having watched Captain Power since the very first episode and loved every moment of it, the more shocked I was when the show was cancelled. If you like science fiction with a touch of end time feeling you will love the show as well.

4855408,5,B005OZJE8K,"First things first, lets get the most important point out of the way. Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future was NOT a childrens program. The producers never entended nor claimed otherwise. Unfortunately, like all sci-fi/genre TV programming of the '80's, it was treated as one no matter the content. In all fairness, having a title like ""Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future,"" being bankrolled mostly by money from Mattel, and being saddled with a Saturday AM timeslot in most markets didn't help the situation.

Having said that, if your looking at this as some kind of prehistoric ""Power Rangers"" for the kids, look elsewhere. Though more than tame by todays family viewing standards, it's important to note their is blood, violence, character death, four-letter language, and even some implied sex. I'm not saying this is sci-fi Sopranos here, but it is very much a product of the syndication market of the time.

Now if your looking for an engrossing series with a backstory that brings to mind the works of Asimov and Ellison, with a writing staff including the legendary J. Michael Straczynski (listen for a clever reference to Straczynski's Babylon 5), and Larry DiTillio you're in the right place.

There are also stellar performances by a predominately Canadian cast of (then)relative unknowns including Tim Dunigan (who originated the role of Timpleton ""Faceman"" Peck in the pilot of the legendary ""A-Team"" television series) as Captain Jonathan Power, 19 year-old Jessica Steen (years before Armageddon and Earth-2) as the tragic Jennifer ""Pilot"" Chase, and Sven Thorsen (close friend, fellow body-builder and frequent collaborator with Arnold Schwarzenegger) as Michael ""Tank"" Ellis, a genetically engineered killing-machine who has abandoned his violent past for a life of peace.

Great cast, great writers, great story. In my opinion, some of the best science-fiction to come out of the late 80's.",1318291200,55,1926,5.223300970873787

4855411,4,B005OZJE8K,"Great nostalgia. I enjoyed the show all over again, even saw a couple of episodes that I'd missed in the original run. While the special effects are a little dated, one has to take into account this show was made on a TV budget when digital effects were in their infancy. The acting still holds up over time as does the overall story arc. As an adult, I was able to see much deeper into the story that was being told.

4855416,3,B005OZJE8K,"I can still remember being 17 and watching the final episode of this show.  In those final moments when I thought it would have the Hollywood happy ending, I kind of screamed, ""No way!  You can't do that!""  Well, they did, and it stuck with me the rest of my life that things do not always work out in the end.  I did not even know the series was cancelled until the next week when it started over.  Back then we didn't have the Internet to break it to us gently before it happened.  Of course 27 years later and being much older, I now understand that killing off main characters is just a way to leave the series, even if the series dies abruptly.

As for the set itself, I was disappointed in the case right from the beginning.  The double-wide, left side holds one disc.  There is an overlapping double disc flip tray in the middle and another double disc tray on the right.  I learned the hard way that the distributor took the cheap, eco-friendly approach with hollowed out trays so that when I throw my collection in the garbage, it will not impact the environment as much.  Really?  How many of my collectible sets have I thrown away to this day?  None.  Except for the eco-friendly ones which I replaced with solid cases to protect my investment.  Needless to say, flipping the tray over the first time put fingerprints on the reading side of the disc when my fingers went through the holes in the back.  Good job.  Although the disc tabs holding the discs in place are solid enough to keep the discs from coming loose in transit, they are even harder to remove the disc later without fear of damage to the disc.

It does come with a nice printed booklet with behind the scenes info from the producer.  Each episode is listed with a description, and the cast is included.  Discs one through three contain the entire season one episodes at eight episodes per disc.  Video and audio were okay, but there were no subtitles.  Over the years, I have expected subtitles by default for those late night viewings when I don't want to wake everyone in the house.  It also helps so I don't have to keep rewinding to catch a piece of soft dialog.

Disc 4, the bonus disc, is a bit of a mystery.  It is supposed to contain a TV movie and a documentary.  Alas, my disc made loud noises and would not play in any of the three players I tried.  Obviously it has some kind of a defect, so back the set goes.  I hope I can get one that plays, however, I really do not want to watch the other three discs at this time just to make sure they still work.  I'll update this when I get my replacement set.",1418428800,2,2592,4.28659793814433

4855420,3,B005OZJE8K,"This is a series I remember watching back in 1987, along side Star Trek: The Next Generation.  For those who don't know, Captain Power was developed in conjunction with a toy line that was ground breaking in that it allowed you to ""interact"" with what was going on the screen.  You could use a good guy or bad guy jet, or a hover craft artillery piece (that one never featured in the show itself) to ""shoot"" targets on the screen that were painted on the robot troops and ships to score points.  The shots fired on screen by the robots could ""hit"" your ship too, deducting points.  If you lost all your points a motor ejected the cockpit and any action figure you had inside.  The ships could also interact with and ""shoot"" each other in play duels.  It was really cutting edge stuff back then.  It also generated a little bit of controversy in the press.

As for the TV program itself, it was also way ahead of its time.  It was expensive to make, used cutting edge (at the time) CGI that, while it may seem laughable by today's standards, was strangely appropriate and added a kind of odd otherworldly aspect to the two ""Warlord"" class Biodread machines.  The only other way to create such characters would have been through puppetry or hand-drawn animation, so it was a bold experiment which, for better or worse, paved the way for modern photo-realistic CGI that we're all used to seeing now.  Beyond the technical aspects, the story was pretty dark for a TV show built around a kid's toy line.  Watching some of the interviews with the writers makes it a bit more clear as to why - they were writing the show for adults, but their funding was through Mattel, so it was a rather odd marriage of Terminatoresque post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror and shoot-em-up hero action aimed squarely at adolescent boys.  People actually die, and the process of being ""digitized"" is portrayed as pretty much the most torturous thing you could ever go through.  Heavy stuff for a ""kid's"" show!  The names do sound campy and corny straight from a kid's toy line - ""Captain Power"", ""Lord Dread"", etc, but how the characters obtained their names is explained in back story itself and actually makes sense.  The hero's name is actually Johnathan Power, and he holds a military rank of Captain (all his comrades also have ranks or Lieutenant, Major, Corporal, etc), and Lord Dread obtained his name after his original persona suffered an accident that permanently disfigured him.  It was rather clever in how they worked this in, and unlike a lot of ""hero"" type program of the day, the characters have depth and the program takes itself completely seriously.  If you're into sci-fi for sci-fi's sake it's worth a look.

Now as for the product itself... this is where I have to take some points off and why I can't give it 4 stars.  There's some quality problems with the actual DVD's themselves, and reading through other reviews, I'm not the only one that's encountered this problem.  Disk 2 would break up on ""A Summoning of Thunder:  Part 2"", about halfway through the episode.  My computer's DVD drive read the disk without errors, but my Blu Ray player hates it.  I requested a return, and when I got the new copy, the same issue was present, but worse.  Both disks had a cloudy appearance to the actual media, so it appears to be a defective run on that particular disk.  I did not feel like playing a crap shoot of returning copy after copy to try to get a ""good"" copy, so I sent the ""replacement"" back and kept the first set, and I resorted to making a copy of Disk 2 on my computer so I can play it in my Blu Ray player.  That in itself was difficult since they used copy protection on the discs, so I had to do some research and find the right tools to do this.  It is 100% LEGAL to copy A DVD for archival or personal use in this manner, but the industry still insists on using copy protection that was broken a decade ago to frustrate the user.  I now have a playable Disk 2 that works on my Blu Ray player, but I should not have had to do this.

I did not encounter the sound quality problems that others have mentioned.  I was able to understand the dialogue perfectly, and the sound and music seemed balanced out.  That was with my TV speakers and a set of high quality headphones, and also my computer's no-so-high quality speakers.  I do have my speakers adjusted to keep bass low and treble a bit higher though, as I do not like high bass, so that may have something to do with it?  The picture quality does leave quite a bit to be desired.  It makes me wonder what condition the masters were in.  You will not get an HD-quality picture from this.  Watching it on a smaller screen helps with the fidelity a bit, but if you're watching it on a huge high-def display, the picture is definitely going to suffer.

I am glad they put the series on disk as anything's better than VHS, and while the picture isn't as good as it could be I am happy to be able to watch the shows again.  If you liked the series it's a definite must, but beware the quality control on the disks themselves.  If you've never heard of Captain Power, it's holds a rather unique place in sci-fi history.",1407801600,2,5173,4.4443266171792155

It was Saturday morning and you'd have just washed your uniforms and you ironed them while watching CAPTAIN POWER on Armed Forces Network. This was a clever series that made the most of its budget and tried to frontier an interesting connection between the TV program itself and kids who owned the toys. I enjoyed how both Captain Power and Lord Dread would yearly go to the grave site of Captain Jonathan Power's father and pay their respects on hallowed ground. They both knew one another was in the vicinity. But neither fired on the other. It was in this one place where civility won out over savagery. That scene stays in your head 25 years later.

4855432,4,B005OZJE8K,"Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future is best remembered as the TV show with interactive toys. Anybody who grew up in the 80s has unfortunately learned by now that most of our Saturday morning childhood favorites were really just toy commercials disguised as entertaining cartoons, but Captain Power was a bit different. It has the distinction of having been live-action and having more mature writing than an average episode of Transformers. It was a post apocalyptic series set in the far future, with a complex central villain and heroes who died. Of course, by now the early CGI effects used in the show look dated (although they probably didn't look all that great back in 1987 either), and the show is not without its moments of ""cheesiness"", but it's held up much better than most Saturday morning favorites.

 A few words on the packaging: Terrible, horrible, awful, no good.  The four discs are stacked in pairs, one on top of the other. I fortunately didn't have much difficulty getting the discs out or putting them back in the case, but it's definitely not the best way to contain DVDs.  The case was also slightly cracked, so it doesn't close completely. A sleeve with each disc in a separate case would have made for much better packaging. As many other reviews have also noted, the video quality is not spectacular, and there are moments (usually in the action sequences) when the sound editing renders dialogue nearly inaudible. But it's great to have this series on DVD, and the quality of the extras are enough to make the series worth it.",1375833600,,1564,4.760147601476015
4855433,3,B005OZJE8K,"Ohh, I'd wanted to see this again for so long, based on happy, fuzzy childhood memories of this show. Used to watch it religiously as a kid.

Sadly, it simply doesn't quite stand the test of time. It's really campy, very 80's. The CGI  simply wasn't there yet in the 80's/90's and it looks pretty terrible / blocky / jerky / repetitive.

On the plus side there are one or two featurettes that make the set worthwhile and give some of the history of why / who it got produced. The perils and pitfalls of TV production, toy design, etc. The features were interesting.

The show itself was actually pretty bad. For a kids' show, okay, it was cool for dealing with adult themes and not ""pandering"" or ""talking down"" to kids. Things that perhaps wouldn't fly today? But it was pretty campy and over-wrought... The stuff better left to fuzzy childhood memories. The first few episodes, especially, were almost painful to watch (in the featurettes they do kind of explain a little about the first few episodes). They eventually got slightly better, but overall it was still pretty silly stuff.",1370390400,2,1086,4.670157068062827

4855436,5,B005OZJE8K,"I still have the pilot episode recorded on VHS with Portuguese subtitles. Since I live 160 miles from the TV station it was always a problem receiving TV transmissions without grain, ""rain"" or interferences from RF transmission.

Nowadays with the techology we have those old shows seem a bit outdated and they are but sure make our tears come out whenever we put the DVD on the player and start hearing the theme song. Soaron was my favorite character and Lord Dredd reminded me of Darth Vader.

Two series which should have been given a proper and more thorough treatment was Captain Power and Sledge Hammer. It's unfortunate the studios/ realising companies couldn't restore the original picture quality from the film itself and not the video masters whether they are in Betacam or U-Matic or other medium.

Since I have to see NTSC video on a PAL Plasma screen, the vertical lines are stretched to fill the 1,33:1 image and therefore the quality loses a bit of quality when taken from old tapes. Just like the 7th season of MacGyver for example or the video they took out of the Mission Impossible 80's series.

Nevertheless if you like science fiction and The Terminator movies and CGI characters, you'll love this series set on a post-apocalyptic (yet again) Earth. Enjoy.",1365552000,,1278,4.821917808219178

In the foreward to these DVDs they mention the guns and it makes me wonder if they did test them......obviously not.

A somewhat derivative science fiction series that blended live action with (state-of-the-art at the time, especially for TV) CG effects along with interactivity at home, delivering a positive message through an action-packed post-apocalyptic war each week before it was prematurely cancelled after only one season over complaints about manipulative marketing and perceived concerns over violent content (in that area, this show seemed a lot more appropriate for kids than another popular sci fi show of the time, ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" which regularly featured sexual themes, gore, violence, etc).

Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future was one of the first amercan sci-fi serials to make it on Russian television. Even with our VCR and saving the broadcast episodes on the tape I was unable to fully experience the show later on due to both failings of the tape cassetes and missed episodes. Than internet happened and I learned that unlike more well known stuff, like Knight Rider or The A Team, it would be pretty much impossible for me to be able to download it anywhere. thoug that eventually happened.

And now, somewhat accidentally I stumbled upon captainpowerreturns.com and learned of the DVD release. Ordered immediately.

As complete series editions go, this one is rather simple - a clamshell with four discs, small booklet with episode guide, some concept art and foreword from the creator of the series and a cardboard sleeve with nice foil applications on the phoenix logo and Power himself.

Video quality is decent, even excellent considering the age of the source material.
Audio is of good quality but a bit too quiet - I had to dial the volume all the way up.
Bonus features are very extensive, author commentary tracks for multiple episodes on each disc, extensive documentary on the creation of the series, a TV movie serving as abridged version of the series and more.

And yes, the Borg were copied from the Big Bad of the series - lord Dredd.",1339027200,,1471,4.624521072796935

4855451,5,B005OZJE8K,"OMG, I thought this day would never come.

Firstly, I'd like to say when I got this boxed set, Parts 1 and 2 of ""The Summoning of Thunder"" absolutely refused to play. Amazon had already sent out my replacement copy before I had my mailing label printed out to return the poorly functioning set back. The replacement set works fine, big kudos for a trouble free exchange with amazon.

Now back to the series...

When this series first came out, like a lot of other sci-fi fans, I was chased away by the title. Then I heard reviews and decided I had to watch for myself,...and was I ever glad I did. The storytelling was amazing and created a Nazi era style world of machines bent on the destruction of all flesh and emotion.

In the distant future, wars were fought by robots called bio-mechs. Human casualties became virtually non-existent which made war commonplace and easy. Enter Captain Power's Father, Dr Stuart Gordon Power and Dr Power's friend and colleague Dr Lyman Taggart. Their plan was to create a supercomputer named Overmind that could override and take control of all the warring biomechs on the planet, thus ending all war once and for all. But where Dr Power felt more testing was necessary, Taggart impatiently went behind his back and hooked himself up to Overmind. The experience changed both Taggart and Overmind, and the next day bio-mechs were marching into cities worldwide.

The series was the first to have CGI characters. For those used to the Digital age with smoother looking integrations of computer animation with real life, this is the series that started it all. Younger impatient types might call it cheap or even primitive, but they weren't generating the CGI characters of this series with the small hand held devices we have today. It took hard work, multiple camera angles, and multiple, slower, computers.

The fight scenes were also not the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon kind of today. It was the 80's afterall. But the storytelling came from the likes of J Michael Straczynski (Babylon Five), Gerry Davis (the original 1963 Dr Who), Larry Ditillio (He-Man, Shera, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, B5, Bionic 6...take your pick), Christy Marx (JEM, B5, GI Joe, and the 1978 Fantastic Four), and Gary Goddard (Star Trek...the ORIGINAL Star Trek).

These same writers would go on to write the (at the time) new Star Trek: The Next Generation and Babylon 5 series. And you see hints of Captain Power in those series. People look at Lord Dread and comment on how he looks exactly like a Borg. Why did they copy from Star Trek, is what is often asked. They didn't. Dread came first, the Borg second. People were digitized in Captain Power first, assimilated by the Borg later on. When Tank talks about his escape from the genetic engineering lab, the name of the lab is Babylon 5.

And then there are storylines with horror taken from history...mass genocide of humanity, a Dread Youth, much like the Hitler Youth, people being taken to places they don't come back from...in the episode ""Pariah"", Mitch talks about being in a lab where he was experimented on with others, and where he saw lifeless bodies being carried out, never to be seen again. In the episode ""Judgment"", Pilot confronts her former life as a member of the Dread Youth and the uniform she used to wear. She is put on trial by a group of townspeople who survived the fiery destruction of her first outing with her Dread Unit. Like Holocaust survivors pointing out Nazi oppressors, ""It was you...It was you."" There was an unaired, unproduced episode that had Dread ordering the burning of all books, destroying human culture. Historical memories with a very personal, emotional touch. That is what made this series great.

This packet does have some equally nice gems in it. The Making of Captain Power (Out of the Ashes) had fantastic info of behind the scenes of the first season and what was contemplated if a second season were produced.

There is also an original, unaired (in the US) TV movie called ""The Legend Begins."" Essentially it is the entire first season compressed into a movie format. It's very rough editting, and Soaron has a different sounding voice, but it has some interesting moments. There are two in particular:

1. In Retribution Pt II, after giving false info to the Power team on orders of Lord Dread, Locke strikes the Overunit Commander. Locke's obviously disgusted with the betrayal he just committed but we don't know why. In the unaired movie, Locke asks the Overunit commander, ""What about my kids?"" It's a bit hard envisioning Locke married, never mind with kids, but interesting none the less.

2. At the very end of Retribution Pt II, we see Pilot finally confess her love to Jon Power as she presses the self destruct blowing up the Power base, destroying Blastarr, and keeping resistance info out of Dread's hands. What we don't see in that episode, but do in the unaired movie, is Jon Power responding to Pilot over the com silently mouthing the words ""I love you"" just as Pilot blows up the Power Base.

Gary Goddard has hinted that one day Captain Power might return as a TV series or movie...half of me is excited at the prospect, the other half leary given some of the horrible remakes I have seen. But I have also seen the proposed storylines if the second season were produced, and I would love to see this series return, if it lives up to the original.

The Legacy of the Metal Wars ...

I walk into Waterloo Records in Austin TX and on the front counter is this beautiful DVD of my all time favorite show CAPTAIN POWER and The Soldiers Of The Future.  The first time I have ever seen this show in a legit non fan made format.  Complete with bonus features and commentaries.  I could not wait, I placed it on the counter and simply said NOW!  I didn't even care that it would be more expensive than on Amazon... I had to have it NOW!  (I bought another copy for friends Amazon you're welcome) This show, is by far, a true founding brick of my life. I watched it as a little boy in Lansing MI religiously, not He-Man, not GI JOE, not Transformers, but Captan Power.

Gary Goddard, visionary behind Captain Power, set off on a journey to make a profound science fiction show for both adults and children to entertain and educate while at the same time with help from MATTEL pushed the television medium to heights never seen at the time from interactive jets that were affected by the lazer blasts coming from the screen, to the first ever all CGI characters interacting with human beings.  Captain Power is one of those gems, one of those rare jewels that elevated the world of entertainment and took no credit.  Let's strip away for a moment the costumes, the technology, the toys and all the other fluff that goes with it.  This show was about HUMANITY!  How humanity even when faced with annihilation, slavery, digitization will hold strong and persist.  Lord Dread with all of his vast armies of Dread Heads, BioDreads and flock of other humans ""Dread Youth"" who had lost their way on their journey in life ... could still not end the goal of a small band of rebels dedicated to their creed ""to protect all life"" ... their name was Captain Power and The Soldiers of the Future.

I have had life long friendships that began with a simple question ""Have you seen Captain Power?"" ... ""yes"" .... I owe Captain Power that.  My imagination and love for science fiction I owe to Captain Power. My art and music has been inspired by Captain Power ([...]) my song ""Lament for Jennifer Chase"".  I even have the BioDread logo tattooed on my arm out of adoration and respect.  Thank You Gary Goddard for bringing this into my life and thank you for this DVD release.  The documentary alone had me almost in tears realizing that some of the core values I have learned I learned from Captain Power.  I never stopped watching this show and never stopped loving it.  To hear from Tim Duggan, Jessica Steen and Peter MacNeill recount their days on set with never before seen production shots, tales of visiting children at Toys R Us and hanging onto a picture with a fan and their excitement of being immortalized as action figures truly enhanced my appreciation for the depth of this show.  I can watch this show now and see where the roots of amazing shows like Star Trek TNG, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica came from.

 I can not say enough good things about this show!  Sure the special effects look dated, the DVD menus don't blow my mind, the conversion isn't Blu Ray awesome quality, but you know what ... I DON'T CARE! why? because this little gem is like finding a dinosaur fossil to me ... sure its old and past its time but its history and our way of life or at least the way we view it on tv was molded and shaped by shows like Captain Power.  And now I finally have an official digital copy to hold and cherish for all time. Now maybe you're reading this review and asking questions like ""Is the show coming back"" or ""is Jessica Steen still hot?"" or ""Are the Training videos on the discs""....  Let me finish the answers are ""maybe"", ""smokin'"" and ""no! buy em on VHS""

now can I finish?

CAN I FINISH?

Ok I'm Finished

ps. Gary Goddard rules! Have JJ Abrams remake Captain Power and let me write the music .... POWER ON!!!!!

4855453,4,B005OZJE8K,"This DVD set receives 4 stars because of the strength of the quality of the scripts, from such writers as contributors to Babylon 5, Beast Wars, Real Ghostbusters, and He-Man.  I deducted 1 star for some quality control issues in the official release of the DVD set.

The video quality is okay, although there are places where the occasional artifact pops up.  It looks like the producers just fed the masters into encoding software and didn't check the results afterwards to manually clean up any effects left behind.

The audio is a disappointment, too.  The music and sound effects drown out the dialogue on many occasions.

Some episodes are missing title, writer, and director credits.

I had difficulty removing and then reinserting the 3rd and 4th discs into the packaging.  They could have come up with a better way to package the DVD's so you don't risk damaging them.  In fact, after some attempts to reinsert the discs where they belong, the case would not fit back inside its slip cover.

In many ways, the unofficial fan made DVD sets that came out before VSC's official DVD release are better in this aspect.  What this set has going for it though is a fine collection of bonus features that only an official studio release can obtain.  There's a 90 minute documentary about the making of Captain Power.  There's actor, writer, and creator commentary on 6 selected episodes.  There's The Legend Begins, the compilation TV movie shown in markets mostly outside of the US around 1989.  There's a bonus that offers glimpses into the future of Captain Power had it continued on to a 2nd season, with many previous only before hinted at revelations about what that 2nd season would have been like.

Bottom line is, the package isn't the best it could be, but, it could be a lot worse.  The main strength of this DVD release is the fine quality of the writing from such authors as J. Michael Straczynski.",1324339200,8,1912,4.72809667673716
4855454,3,B005OZJE8K,"I am disappointed with a few things about this set.  The case design is pretty bad.  The discs overlap each other inside the case.  The two top overlapping discs of the set were really hard to remove.  I was afraid I was going to break them and they gave me such trouble that I won't be putting them back in the original case.  Also, beware of the flipper that two of the discs are housed on because it has some large holes on the bottom and if you aren't careful, you will be touching the bottom of your discs.

The audio in the episodes leaves something to be desired.  The sound effects/background music can drain out the dialogue a bit much at times and you are left straining to hear what they said.  The picture quality is about what can be expected for a show from the 80s.

As for the show itself, I still enjoy watching these episodes.  The storylines were pretty good for a kids show.",1323907200,5,894,4.267857142857143

I am returning this set to AMAZON for a replacement.  Hopefully all 4 disks will play this time.",1323648000,2,436,4.216867469879518
4855456,1,B005OZJE8K,"This review is of the DVD set itself, not of the series.

I am extremely disappointed with the DVD set.  I watched the series as a child and as I got older and watched again recorded episodes, the quality of the writing and acting only became more apparent.  So when I learned of this DVD set, I was very excited.

I got it in the mail and put the first disk into my DVD player...  No closed captions, no subtitles...  Bad, very bad.  Having lost my hearing in the intervening twenty-five years, not having captions or subtitles for one of my favorite childhood series was depressing, especially given my VHS tapes don't have captions either, so I've been holding out hope for years for a DVD release.

I can't recommend this DVD set at all.",1323561600,20,741,4.437037037037037

The video quality is about what I expected, but I have to admit that I'm more than a little surprised (and disappointed) about the audio mix. I've watched two episodes thus far, and the music/sound effects are SERIOUSLY drowning out the dialogue.  And without any subtitles or closed captions available on the disc, it's sometimes impossible to tell what the actors are saying.  There don't seem to be any audio options on the set, so I can't really modify the sound setup.  I'm quite curious if anyone else is experiencing the same problems as I am.

8482222,3,B005OZJE8K,"Really surprised that the video quality wasn't better. I have old VHS recordings with somewhat better quality at times.

Captain Power was originally intended to be a toy tie-in series marketed to kids. But, the combination of live action (instead of animation), quality production, and interesting concepts appealed to a wider age group.

It's pointed out by the series creators that Star Trek's famous ""Borg"" characters came AFTER Lord Dread and other such similar characters and ideas in Captain Power. For a simple 30 minute ""morning kids program"" it really did manage to entertain and come up with some interesting concepts.

Because the series was supposed to directly interact with the toys (via flashing pulses on screen) you'll notice a tendency for battle scenes to be directed in a peculiar manner. The toy line was not the success that Mattel had hoped for, so the series seemed to exhibit less ""interactive"" qualities as it progressed.

The CGI effects are very low quality compared to today's standard, but at the time it was very unusual to have such effects in ANY series. The costumes and set designs are suprisingly good.

If you're buying this as a nostalgia item, then you'll know what to expect. Only the video quality may disappoint. Viewers who are new to this series shouldn't expect too much, but it's fairly good for what it is. I'd suggest that you search for a few previews and trailers online before committing to a purchase.

This DVD collection is packaged nicely with a cardboard slip cover and very nice 10 page booklet that contains series info, episode guide, and pictures.

watching this 'exciting show' from my youth.  It is very well written especially for its day,
but looking at it again, it was not well done when it was filmed and had poorly-acted
scenes.  It was, for its time, a relatively high-budget TV project, however rewatching
it now as an adult, I see no magic.  Sometimes 'nostalgia' really is a word that makes
us believe a less-than-ordinary thing or event was far better or more important than it ever truly was.
Perhaps its not the shows of our youth that we embrace with such fondness, as a chance to relive our
younger days and know then what we think we know now.  Hindsight is NOT always 20/20 and 'Nostalgia'
only fools us into believing hindsight is clearer than looking forward.
It is still a classic show from the mid-1980s and was adequate for its time.
