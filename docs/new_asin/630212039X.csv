Rhino Home Video makes this as a compilation/Documentary narrated by a monotone,Ted Newsom who made many such documentaries on monsters. This was one of three that Rhino released including Dracula and the Wolf Man,which I also own.

The history included is informative,which traces the film history of the Frankenstein Monster from the 1931 version through the 70s.
There's trailers for the following Frankenstein flicks:
Frankenstein(1931)
Bride of Frankenstein(1935)
Son of Frankenstein(1939)
Ghost of Frankenstein(1942)
Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man(1943)
House of Frankenstein(1944)
House of Dracula(1945)
Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein(1948)
Curse of Frankenstein(1957)
Frankenstein's Daughter(1958)
Frankenstein 1970(1958)
Revenge of Frankenstein(1958)
I Was a Teenage Frankenstein(1958)
Evil of Frankenstein(1962)
Frankenstein Created Woman(1966)
Frankenstein Conquers the World(1965)
Jesse James meets Frankenstein's Daughter/Billy the Kid Vs. Dracula(1965)
Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster(1966)
Frankenstein Must be Destroyed(1969)
Horror of Frankenstein(1970)
Lady Frankenstein(1972)
Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell(1973)
Young Frankenstein(1974)

There are also many rare clips and photos from various other movies including karloff as Monster at a celebrity Baseball game in 1940 and Karloff as Monster in an episode of Route 66.
The doctored up photo that shows what Bela Lugosi was supposed to look like as Frankenstein's Monster confused me for years. Nowadays,It's clearly a still from Dracula(1931) with Lugosi's Monster from Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man wearing the wig from the Golem(1920)!

This is a great starting place to set young Horror fans on the right foot and is fun viewing for fans of the films and theatrical Trailers.

The documentary's final line still reads true:
""When the sharp blades of Freddy,Jason and Leatherface finally grow dull,someone will experiment again. As We can see it's a VERY big family,and undoubtably Frankenstein will live forever"".",1234483200,3,2127,5.937908496732026
