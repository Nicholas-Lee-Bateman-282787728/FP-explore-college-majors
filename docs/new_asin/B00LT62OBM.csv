8667903,5,B00LT62OBM,"This is a documentary about a film that was truly a lost masterpiece.  ""Stark Love"" is a silent movie that's a story of love, conflict, and family that captures the characteristics, customs, and conventions from a bygone era in Appalachia. Any film buff, historian, cultural anthropologist, or simply a lover of a good story will really enjoy this documentary about ""Stark Love"" and watch it again and again.",1407974400,,408,5.0
