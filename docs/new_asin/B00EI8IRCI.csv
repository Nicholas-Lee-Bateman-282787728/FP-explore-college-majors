Andrews Blu-ray Review: Director Guy Ritchie's version of the great fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, is first and foremost an action hero. Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' films aren't anything like the new the British BBC TV shows, 'Sherlock,' where Sherlock Holmes usually sticks to observing rather than fighting. That's not to say this Sherlock Holmes, played superbly by Robert Downey, Jr., is any slouch when it comes to figuring out complicated dastardly deeds, but he is a Holmes for a newer generation of film goers who are used to frantic, helter-skelter action instead of methodical pacing.

Part of the fun with the Sherlock Holmes films is the coy way it plays with the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. These two men are oddly close and Sherlock Holmes usually casts Dr. Watson's, especially in the Sherlock Holmes: A Games of Shadows the new bride is out of the picture whenever he finds the time.

The first 'Sherlock Holmes' film from Guy Ritchie cantered around a one-off villain named Lord Blackwood [Mark Strong]. The presence of one James Moriarty [Jared Harris] in the second film was only hinted at in that film. Here the rivalry is front and centre, and the two foes whose conflict has spanned the test of time, find themselves once again facing off against each other, both of them keenly aware of the other's intellect. James Moriarty is a dangerous sociopath, but so is Sherlock Holmes. The only difference is James Moriarty doesn't mind if he kills people to get what he wants, Sherlock Holmes isn't homicidal.

Robert Downey, Jr. picks up right where he left off with the first film, with the second film entitled Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and maybe even making him slightly more manic this time around. Sherlock Holme isn't dealing with the situation at hand very well. In the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Dr. John Watson [Jude Law] is finally getting married, and Sherlock Holmes doesn't like it one bit. He has a deep love for his friend, one that he'd never admit, so he can't really get over the fact that his one and only true friend is leaving him. For a woman!

Much like the first 'Sherlock Holmes' film, in the second film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is just as fast-paced and just as action-packed. Even the flashbacks, as Sherlock Holmes works problems out in his mind at lightning-fast speed, are edited in a semi-nauseating way that will remind you of the cut scenes from Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' and complete with sound effects for camera movements.

The fight scenes in both films, while nicely choreographed, are edited like every other modern action film, but with a lot of panache. There are nearly incoherent bursts of flailing limbs crashing into each other as Sherlock Holmes takes on one attacker after another. I think that since the fight was already shown in slow-motion inside Sherlock Holmes' mind that Guy Ritchie doesn't feel the need for us to watch the entire thing again in regular motion. Instead we get a rapid-fire succession of action shots.

However, like the first film Sherlock Holmes, in the second film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow is carried this time solely on the back of Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma as a manic sociopath who may or may not be going completely delusional. He delivers his lines as fast as Guy Ritchie delivers the action. Sherlock Holmes' mood in this film seems much more agitated most likely due to his best friend getting married and leaving him. Downey is a treat to watch. There are certain things he must retain to make it a believable Sherlock Holmes, but he adds something else to the part that makes him so watchable. He's made the character his own. I hope sometime in 2015 they will release a third Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes film, as they are fantastic entertainment.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Both Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a very shadowy video presentation that features great detail even though much of the films are spent lurking in dark places. Warner has offered a 1080p encoded transfer that looks, well, perfect. These are both demo-quality transfer throughout. When you can have films of this calibre as dark as this, honestly, I'm pretty sure that there are only a handful of well-lit scenes, especially with the wedding being one of them, the rest of the scenes play out in lots of darkened clubs, alleyways, balconies, parties, and forests. This is a very dark film with a colour palette dominated by greys and blacks. It could've easily been a movie fraught with crushing and banding, but it isn't. Blacks are some of the inkiest you'll ever see on this format. Shadows are perfectly delineated. Just check out the close-ups during the scene in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sneak into the weapons factory. Even though it's under thick darkness, shadows still accentuate facial features like lines, pores, and stubble. These are easy features to lose in a really dark film, but they aren't lost here. The same holds for textures as well. The woven texture of Dr. Watson's suits stand out no matter what lighting situation the guys find themselves in. To sum up both films, they are well-lit scenes sparkle with clarity. Skin tones appear to be genuinely natural. This is just a great presentation all around. There wasn't one instance of source noise, not one instance of banding that I saw and both Blu-ray discs look one of the best looking Blu-rays to come out in years.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Both film's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation is just as impressive as the 1080p video image. Seriously, this is a heavy, thundering audio mix that will grab your eardrums. Booming bass rolls through the soundtrack during many of both film's intense scenes. Especially like the towering structure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows that comes crashing down in a weapons factory you'll notice the entire room shake like something is falling down on your house. Sound effects are used with great frequency, especially during the slow-motion action scenes in the Sherlock Holmes' films flashback scenes. Whenever Guy Ritchie's signature ""wham, bam,"" sound effects take over they are localised perfectly in the speakers that they need to be in. The slow-motion scene with Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes, and others running away from the weapons factory in the Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, being fired upon, features some wonderful directionality. Bullets whiz by, the camera stops and watches a bullet splinter a tree trunk as the sound is produced with perfect clarity in the front channels. Explosions happen in front of, to the side of, and behind the characters, each time with the heft of the sound coming from the necessary place in the sound field. The audio in both films will easily impress. Guy Ritchie's soundtracks have always been chock full of special sound effects and there's no difference here. The entire track, from front to rear, is alive with action and doesn't stop until the credits have finished rolling.

Finally, Guy Ritchie the director and Robert Downey Jr. actor interpretation is certainly not in adherence with the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle original. In this version, Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. put emphasis on Sherlock Holmes as action hero as much as his deductive reasoning capabilities. As a result, both films are somewhat convoluted script-wise, but definitely provides a lot of popcorn film action, including a great slow-motion effects chase and battle scenes. No matter which Blu-ray disc release you opt for, both the video and audio elements of the get high marks for it transfer to Blu-ray, making for great demo material for your family, friends, and neighbours. That is why I am so honoured to have this 2 Film Blu-ray package, as it is total entertainment and will keep you well occupied throughout the two Blu-ray discs and is well worth dipping in now and again, as the first time you view these Blu-ray discs, you miss so much the first time round. Highly Recommended!
