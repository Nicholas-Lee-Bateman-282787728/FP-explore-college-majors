8494761,4,B003FNQDMS,"I gave this DVD a 4.0 because it is one of the few programs made about the air war in Afghanistan and its footage is very recent and of good quality. A lot of the footage is shot from the cockpit and is of other F-16s flying in formation and performing attack missions. Also much of the footage is 'gun camera' footage from the weapon sensors right before they impact on the target. most of the footage is of good quality color with some black & white (from the weapons). There are descriptions of the F-16, LANTIRN pods, laser guided bombs, Maverick missiles and 'dumb bombs'. The documentary is narrated by a retired F-16 pilot and he does a good overall of narrating.

The content is mostly of bombing and missile strikes of the air war in Afghanistan. It focuses on its subject, the F-16, very well and does not have hardly any footage of other aircraft. The main documentary is about 74 minutes long with a 10 minute show of the F-16 performing aerial maneuvers at an air show, for a total length of about 85 minutes. The negatives are that this documentary is in my opinion one level down from a Discovery or History Channel documentary in terms its overall quality, though the editing and production of the program is good. That said I have seen much worse documentaries than this one. It is also kind of long/lengthy and repetitive with a 'LOT' of strike missions being showcased.

Overall this is a good value because of its low price, large amount of programming and current footage of the F-16 in combat over Afghanistan. I am an aviation enthusiast and I loved the footage of the F-16 in flight! I think this is a good documentary on the F-16's role in the air war over Afghanistan, despite it not having the quality of a Discovery Channel episode and shows the magnificent job all of the Air Force personnel are doing in Afghanistan to protect us. I would recommend this program to an aviation enthusiast, anyone interested in the F-16 and anyone who has served in Afghanistan looking for a program on the air war over that country. It has been difficult to find any kind of documentary on Afghanistan's air war and this program does a good job documenting it!",1393027200,,2173,4.554987212276215
