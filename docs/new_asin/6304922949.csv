7880407,3,6304922949,"Not really a comedy, not really a horror movie. To be fair, I'm not sure that the director or actors even knew what kind of movie they were trying to make. Still, the acting and story is pleasant enough and moves alon at a nice pace. And I love the fact that the female lead is a really strong woman who knows what she does and does not want from a guy.",1486166400,,353,3.9166666666666665
7880408,2,6304922949,"This actually had potential, but whoever wrote the script missed some of the basic elements of plot. When there are actually chances to heighten the tension or flesh out the characters, they don't happen, leaving you, as a viewer, grasping for air as a would be tackler feels on the football field.  The interaction between the three ""teenagers"" is interesting, as it is quite misogynistic.",1411862400,,390,5.0
7880409,5,6304922949,"I saw this movie in the 50s.  It scared me senseless yet over the years I often thought about it.  I ordered it as an adult and enjoyed it so much, while laughing at my younger self for being afraid.  The movie is not frightening at all, now!",1389744000,2,242,4.0

7880411,4,6304922949,She is always looking for newly released but old horror/scifi movies.  She was happy to add this one to her collection.  She said it was a good movie.,1229212800,5,150,4.321428571428571
7880412,3,6304922949,"The Headless Ghost, now on DVD brings back so many memories of watching this classic ""Teenage Horror"" flick even better.  With remastered digital quality, I had to add this to my ghost collection.  I remember watching this campy movie on Sunday mornings in my PJ's.  Fun, and pretty good special effects for its time, it also is a blast watching it again on a rainy Sunday/Saturday morning.",1226534400,5,390,4.791044776119403
7880413,3,6304922949,"The Headless Ghost was just ""cute"" horror.  ""Cute"" in the sense that there wasn't much that was scary about it.  But it is a fun family-type Halloween movie.  If you are looking for something really frightful, this is not the movie for you.",1225756800,3,240,4.534883720930233
7880414,3,6304922949,Anybody interested in buying this should know that this is actually the 2.35 widescreen version of The Headless Ghost. It doesn't mention this anywhere on the box or on the Cheezy Flicks website. Two stars for the movie (which is just so-so) and an extra star for widescreen.,1213747200,5,275,4.75
7880415,2,6304922949,"For those who enjoy their ghostly chills mixed with comedy, this movie is a disappointment.  The classic comedy ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" does a much better job of providing laughs among the  ghouls.  On the plus side, the authentic British locations help set the  gloomy atmosphere.  The three ""college kids"" who decide to spend  the night in the haunted castle are tiresome. We can make an exception for  Ingrid, the delighfully blonde exchange student who tours the castle in  spiked heels. The ghosts are dull rather than menacing; just a bunch of  English actors dressed in Renaissance costumes.  There are no gauzy special  effects, worth mentioning. There are some mild chuckles along the way, but  not enough to matter.  This movie may have some  appeal for the  ""so-bad-it's-good"" crowd, but others should beware. Even the East  Side Kids did better than this when they kept bumping into Bela Lugosi.",940809600,5,922,5.046666666666667
