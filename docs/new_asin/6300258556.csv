8541768,2,6300258556,"Much of the art presented in this video is actually quite well chosen (for this ""genre""), and it is interesting to think about the cultural/historical context of the pieces. But don't expect -too- much exploration of social themes in this video. The art is showcased by two creeps who, throughout the video, create inane banter to ""compliment"" the pieces. While the woman does bring up a bit of the cultural context of some of the pieces, the man mainly smiles creepily, giggles and makes childish jokes. I'm not sure if this video is intended as a serious (although brief) discourse on the legitimacy of erotic themes in fine and pop art, but it seems to fall short of it's mark, if such was truely intended. Expect a lot of terrible graphics and music, and get ready to feel nauseous whenever your hosts smile and say ""I love you.""",1255392000,,833,4.635135135135135
