the film is visually quite beautiful, and the fact that it was created by a japanese director with polish actors and bits of english thrown in here and there in the futuristic (?) environment makes it all the more fascinating.  i never realized how beautiful the polish language is until i saw this film.

Oshii Mamoru, the guy who gave us the innovative anime, ""Ghost In The Shell: Koukaku Kidoutai,"" has translated that vision to a ""live action"" production, filmed entirely in Poland and in the Polish language.

The story revolves around an ""illegal"" Virtual Reality war game which attracts the disheartened and disfranchised young people in a drab, depressing, uninspiring 'monochrome' world.

The game, called ""Avalon,"" offers its players a brief escape from the harsh realities of their world. (For some-- those who are particularly skilled and experienced at it --the game has also become a means to earning a living.)

But is it possible that there is another world 'beyond' the one they know and experience everyday-- a world 'within' Avalon --that is more desirable and more ""real"" than the one in which they exist? That is exactly what Kusanagi Motoko... uh... I mean ""Ash"" hopes to find out.

Motoko... umm... sorry... I meant ""Ash"" is a solo player who formerly belonged to a team of raiders which called itself ""Wizard."" Their team was the best of the best, considered 'invincible' amongst other players of the game, until something goes wrong during one of their VR campaigns which would later result in the group being disbanded and the decision of several of the former members to go solo.

Going solo exposed the player to greater and more difficult challenges, but the rewards reaped through greater experience points, etc., not only proved an attractive lure but also advanced the player closer to the game's ultimate goal much quicker. Motok... ""Ash"" decides to use her experience to advance through the levels until she reaches the point to where the former leader of ""Wizard"" became trapped in a permanent vegetative state. Oh, yeah... that's the part that got left out -- SOME of the players who advance through to the highest levels never 'snap out of it' ... a condition described as ""unreturned."" And Mot... ""Ash"" wants to know what her former teammate experienced there and what's keeping him there. But in order to do that she's going to need the help of someone she's been observing closely in the game ... the same 'someone' who has likewise been observing her very closely.

The film opens with a scene taken right out of ""Ghost In The Shell,"" carries us through a landscape & mood similar to a cross between a 'Big Brotherless' ""1984"" and ""The Thirteenth Floor"" on Ritalin, culminating in an ending which will surely inspire yet another philosophical discussion about ""real"" and ""virtual"" existences.

No real or easy answers are given at the end of the film, and perhaps that's just as well. Sometimes maybe we do need to just take what's presented to us and write our own ending, as it were. I can just see the tag line already:

 A low budget Polish (with awful acting) flick intended for 'street audience'.

First of all it's desperately trying to be ""Matrix"" in style. The acting is dull and the main character - an Easter European styled femme fatal does nothing but stare from underneath heavy black make up. Due to poor script, a lot of 'action' consists of people staring at something or, what looks like, still shots of nothing in particular (sky, wall, corridor...etc).
The ending is - Nothing. The plot suggests that there is More to the Game, and it is revealed as the 'easter egg' - a ghostly girl is killed (why killed - unclear... basically everything here is solved by shooting at it ).

There is NOTHING more to the game. The character just decides to keep playing because ... 'she choses' to. She claims their lives feel dull and the game is addictive - but the game looks even more painfully dull than their 'life'. Which seems to consist of staring and occasionally chewing noisily in sepia tones.

There is nothing more to the movie than the cover picture. If you saw it - That's IT! This is the most exciting shot in the whole film. I Am glad it's not available on Amazon any more - they probably got sick if complaints.",1414540800,,1221,4.561643835616438

1922447,5,B0000D9PNY,"I had decided to grab up every Cyberpunk movie I could find, and this was one of the true gems of the bunch.

The movie was created by Mamoru Oshii of Ghost in the Shell fame. So the Cyberpunk in my opinion is up to that caliber, or possibly even better.

The film revolves around our main character Ash who is a woman that is one of the stars of this illegal underground gaming community. The game inside the film is sort of like a sci-fi first person shooter. But my description is not doing it justice at all.

The story leaves some things up for interpretation, and can be a little confusing in that regard. It's worth more than a watch or two to try and get a handle on things. But overall it's about this top tier gaming group who disbands and go their separate ways. All the while one of the members has become a vegetable, and another we come across who seems to have taken up odd jobs and/or panhandling.

There is also some kind of strange rumor going on that within the game there is some sort of secret level and elite group known as The Nine Sisters. The movie hinges on the story line of what is truly real, and what is just part of the game type of story telling. Again, another reason it deserves repeat viewings.

Sadly this has only been released on DVD in the U.S. and even though it looks stunning. I would LOVE to see a Blu-Ray release. A blu-ray was released in a limited run in Asia, but it's about $100 U.S. to import it, which is way above my price line =) .

Video Quality: A (Amazing for a DVD and I am crossing my fingers on a Blu-Ray release in the future. )

Storyline: B+ ( You will mull it over well after the movie is off, and it's worth repeat viewings purely for the beautiful visuals, let alone the excellent story.)

Audio Quality :A (Great, booms, shots, vocals all fine. The movie was made in Poland and had a half Asian production team so if you watch it in English, obviously the voices won't match up =) )

Aesthetics: C- (The cover art is alright, but for such a beautiful film could have been SO much better.)

Price: A (Used shipped, you can grab this title for about $4 and it's worth every penny)

Extras: B (There is a 20 minute interview with the creator and a special fx video that runs about an hour. Not too shabby.)

Overall: A ( Great visuals, excellent thought provoking story, and a great package for any Sci-Fi or Cyberpunk fan. You owe it to yourself to see this if you enjoy this genre. )",1347840000,,2447,4.227467811158799
1922448,5,B0000D9PNY,"SPOILERS BIG TIME!!!!!!

As thoughful reviewers have already stated, this film can be interpreted in many ways, and all valid, for it inspires us to take an interior journey, a journey peculiar to who each one of us is uniquely, what many great artists intend, and this film is, in my view, a masterpiece. Here is my interpretation for those interested:

In the opening sequence of Mamoru Oshii's film Avalon we see the protagonist Ash involved in a virtual reality war game mission that she successfully completes. Only a select number of persons can play this game called Avalon, and an even more select number who get paid to play after they have demonstrated exceptional skill, almost always persons who join a ""Party"" of other players to combine forces to reach the highest level, but Ash is a preeminent solo player.

Players go to an assigned room at what is called a terminal branch, where large numbers of spectators gather in an open club-like room to view a large holographic projection of the war game. These clubs are run by a ""Terminal Manager"" appointed by state functionaries called Bishops. Later in the film it is discovered that these terminal managers can, like the bishops, enter the game at will without using the terminal access technology that players have to use. The terminal manager that Ash uses tells her at one point that ""Avalon is just a game [that can be cleared]"" but that a program inside the game called Special Class A, where Ash wants to go to find Murphy, a player who disappeared in Special Class A and whom Ash obsesses on (I would say loves) exists independent of the game and where a player cannot ""reset"" the game. Special Class A is a hidden-away, forbidden field outside of what can be controlled in the game.

The game is the exclusive form of entertainment for disillusioned youth and young adults trapped in a desolate, totalitarian wasteland, much like what was portrayed in Radford's ""1984"" and Gilliam's ""Brazil"". Passive participation as spectators in the game is their only escape from their misery, and it is the best device the state has to control the minds of this group most prone to rebel.
We never see any ruler in this society, only two state functionaries, a terminal manager and a bishop. The latter is a person who had early on mastered the game and was then offered a job at controlling the game for the State.

The problem for the State, however, is that the game was originally designed by a radical, even subversive, computer programmer who goes by the name Nine Sisters for reasons that become obvious: the game was designed to mirror the Legend of King Arthur and how heroic warriors are eventually led to Avalon, a realm of eternal reward, free from the repetitive horror stories that we humans devise. This seems to have been the plan of Nine Sisters from the beginning: she/he took on the entire State, providing a path in virtual reality for those heroic enough to escape from the absolute and everlasting tyranny of the State.

The State has no choice. At first it outlaws the game, but soon realizes that the illegality of the game only inspires the youth even more to pursue it, the only form of rebellion available to them. So the State opts to keep the game as well as its illegality as a continued attraction under the guise of its being dangerous (a player could become brain-dead playing it) while simultaneously infiltrating it to take control of it and hopefully catch up with and destroy Nine Sisters' hidden program--the ultimate escape from the totalitarian state into a life more abundantly.

The state functionaries make great headway in taking control of the game itself, but fail miserably at getting to Class Real, the heart of Avalon's hidden program, although, at great expense to the State, the bishops have been able to gain partial access to the door to Class Real called Special Class A, but even this partial access is granted by Nine Sisters in his/her effort to get the heroes to Class Real. For example, Ash after entering Special Class A becomes more real than she ever has as a digital representation and extension of her self, but the bishop can only enter that realm on a digitally constructed monitor in his digital connection to Ash, not in his digitally represented self independent of his digital relationship to Ash. Nine Sisters is simply a genius that never met his/her match (we never discover who she/he actually is, but the implication is that he/she is immortal in the virtual reality landscape, her/his flesh having totally coalesced with his/her digital representation/extension).

The best way to advance in the game, becoming more powerful and making lots more money, is by joining a ""Party"" of persons with different skills like analyzing data, scouting and warring. It is almost impossible to reach the highest realm without joining a Party. Ash had belonged to a party called Wizard, the most renowned and seemingly invincible Party the game ever had (which made me suspect that Ash, Murphy and Stunner had become a series of clones through a century or more of State control). But during a particular battle one of the members pushes a ""reset"" button when in the face of danger, which can have dire consequences, and in this case it left them all brain-dead (it's possible no one hit reset--this being a cover story to hide the real occurrence--that they were simply defeated because of a cowardly action on the part of Stunner, their scout-guide: it's left up in the air of speculation). The three main members of Wizard--Ash, Stunner and Murphy, the leader--all become brain-dead (""Unreturned"") and become trapped in their digital selves inside the game, for the longer you play the game the more your physical (bio-chemical-neurological) existence coalesces with your digital self. But Murphy is the first to analyze the data and discern that this being trapped in the game is not a bad thing, but a plan by Nine Sisters to liberate him from the totalitarian regime, and that is what he begins to pursue and succeeds.

Once Ash is trapped in the game, the state functionaries create a program inside the game constituting her habitual ""real life"" environment that just keeps looping. But Nine Sisters is able to move into any part of the game at will, and always appears as a ghost--not just directly outside Special Class A, but in places like the hospital where the Unreturned reside in comas. Nine Sisters also provides a singular clue to what life is like in the hidden program of Avalon with the presence of dogs in the environments of digitally constructed persons who occupy space in the game, not only Ash's dog, but all dogs (these pets have a hyper-reality in the game, in my view, because in the beginning Nine Sisters had used real dogs that over time, like humans, continually in degrees coalesce with their digital representations, and because they coalesced the longest, from the beginning, their digital selves are more real than the human digital selves, especially persons created not by a digital representation of real persons, but from data used to construct them within the game). It wasn't the state functionaries that provided Ash with a pet (they are too cold and distant to accomplish that) but Nine Sisters, and the first clue that Nine Sisters is leading Ash to the hidden program of Avalon is when her dog disappears--the only creature that is ""real"" to her--and she is moved subconsciously to go after it.

The State's functionaries called Bishops work tirelessly at great cost to find a way to destroy the hidden program because their employers, like all tyrants, despise any semblance of freedom (O'Brien, the interrogator in ""1984"" tells Winston when he's stretched out on the torture rack, ""Winston...if you want to see a picture of the future, picture a big black boot stepping into the face of humanity into eternity."")

We only get to see one bishop in the film, one of the ""successors to the Apostles"", the original group formed by the oligarchs to control the game and find a way to destroy Nine Sister's hidden program. The bishop we see, in trying to convince Ash to strive to become a bishop for the State, explains to her what her purpose would be: ""Ash...you know which is the better game: One you think you can clear but can't...or one that looks impossible but isn't...Finding that subtle balance...and maintaining it up through all the levels...is our side's job."" In other words, the State now knows after possibly centuries that the immortal Nine Sisters will always be nine steps ahead of the State, but that is no reason not to fight. But whereas the tyrants cling to hope for success, much like governmental leaders of our time cling to the hope of war as a means toward some good, the functionaries have learned to just enjoy the fight itself--the meaning is in playing the game the best you can and nothing else, and because Ash is a master game-player, the bishop is confident that this is the best enticement to have her come over to their side and work for the State, fulfilling her deepest longing: The fight itself IS THE GAME which is the only meaning in the life of a warrior.

To get a better sense of all this one can consult the writings of Marshall McCluan, the 20th century Canadian philosopher who got the ball rolling in understanding technology as the extension of man. Or consult that memorable scene in Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey where our ape-like ancestor discovers a weapon. He becomes so enthralled after using it successfully in battle, that he flings it high into the air, and the scene shifts in that instant to the future, the weapon now appearing as a spacecraft in flight. And with the digital age the monitor is now the ultimate extension of man, first explored in Cronenberg's Videodrome, and then The Matrix, and then the ultimate artistic expression in Avalon.

With the death of God, or, more accurately, the death of a glut of misrepresentations of God, especially by Christians, comes the death of transcendence, and something must replace it, for it is a natural program in our nature required for our fulfillment as persons, and the analogous digital realms of high abstraction dominate in this field. What was once promised by Judaic-Christian prophets is now promised by technocrats.

Oshii's masterpiece, although combining all the ""data"" of mystical traditions East and West, including that of the highly advanced Greek pagan culture, analogously, it is Christian symbolism that dominates in cluing us in on the death of transcendence, even though the Catholic Church hierarchy is specifically used analogously to denote the corruption of functionaries in religious institutions and what is inherently evil in how they can so easily abuse their power, even seek to abuse it in a deliberate heightening of their sense of power, and in light of the child abuse scandal the evidence is in. But the Church's main opposition for over two thousand years has been the gnostic impulse that reaches for higher spiritual ground by separating from the body and living in pure spirit; but Oshii does not succumb to this kind of spiritual quest. Like Jews and Catholics, he wants to have his cake and eat it to, to have spirit coalesce with flesh, made visible in Avalon when Murphy bleeds at the end.",1347321600,3,11315,4.834796076406815
1922449,3,B0000D9PNY,"Most films these days are expected to be meant for entertainment.  But truth is, just as in music, some were meant for art and strictly raise questions and propose messages.

CONTENT ISSUES:
There is no sex or nudity involved and the violence is very conservative.  Not even close to ""Saving Private Ryan"" status.  Though, it's pretty clean in those regards, I will say this, I would not recommend this to kids and early teens because this is a heavily thematic/intellectual film...an art film.  It's very heavy and intellectual.  It requires active thought and is not a film you can just ""pop in while munching on popcorn"". Philosophy majors could get a kick out of it though, unless they were more focused on Virtue Ethics.

MOVING ON:
This is by no means an action flick...even with it's few action sequences, those are even tame...but perhaps it's to help capture more of the mundaneness of a video game addicted society.  Anyways, I'm sure you've got enough of the plot from other reviews and the product synopsis.  It's pretty accurate.  The film is beautifully rendered and the cinematics are stunning and awe-inspiring.  The symbolisms and how they are executed are also beautiful.  So, why do I rate it a 3 star?

The simple answer is that this film was not to my taste.  It's definitely worth a watch and discussion over, but as a film I do not think it's Mamoru Oshi's strongest.  Ultimately, it didn't seem very captivating.  There is a plot, but again, the plot is not what it's about...more of the symbolisms used.  I'm a narrative driven film viewer.  I have a stronger affinity to music, and thus music meant more as ""art pieces"" (such as John Cage's work) I can appreciate and find engaging...though not always agree, albeit even dislike haha.  So I do have a little parallel understanding about what draws people to ""art films"" and the non-mainstream...albeit some I do like, such as ""Linda Linda Linda"".  But anyways, Mamoru Oshi is known for his other works such as Patlabor, Ghost in a Shell, and Jin Roh.

(from this point on, I'm using ""Art"" very specifically to mean something intellectually heavy and not meant particularly to be a mainstream entertainment vehicle...i know this is not the best definition, but it's the best place to start.)

The ""Patlabor"" tv series was a set that focused more on entertaining with hints and injections of heavier and serious themes.  The ""Patlabor"" movies were more artistic/intellectually focused with hints of entertainment.  ""Ghost in a Shell"" had a balance between what can entertain and what is artistic...and it's a strong balance, not a compromised balance.  And Jin-Roh was a brilliant artistic/intellectual take on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood...that had such a strong narrative behind it you sometimes forgot it was more an art piece than anything else.  ""Avalon"", to me seemed  lacking in substance...maybe it's bleek atmosphere was part of the message.

ALL IN ALL:
Again, I am no film connoisseur and therefore am probably missing some of the finer points of ""Avalon"" that other people find tantalizing.  I prefer watching a powerful narrative or a beautifully rendered slice-of-life with good character development...but I didn't find either one here.  I apologize that I'm not really helpful in the content department of this this film.  But one thing I can say is that this film does raise interesting questions, but is open ended.  It is beautiful, but you are more watching a painting than a film.  It's symbolisms are profound, and yet subtle.  But it didn't do much for me.  I believe that art and entertainment can be blended...after all, it is said that one of the best ways to teach is through story and example (which is still narrative)...this was too much pure art and hopeless mundanity for me.",1330992000,,3788,4.884012539184953
1922450,4,B0000D9PNY,"""Avalon"" takes risks.  It doesn't have enough action to be an action flick, it has a sci-fi theme and some violence so it can't be considered a ""relationship"" movie, and it has a logical and accessible story so it isn't a ""real"" art film.

Set in Poland of a near future, ""Avalon"" is an illegal, virtual reality game where first rate players are real world, underground heroes, and losers are ostracized, if not hospitalized.  Ash is a lady gamer, and was a member of one of the best Avalon teams ever, until someone lost their nerve and lost the title for them.  Now, she solos trying to find the hidden level, where only the best players can go.

The story is about Ash and her relationships, the nature of an underground game controlled by an unknown elite, and trying to figure out which realm matters more.  Not for everyone, but I liked it.

The connection between Avalon and the later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-Girls/dp/B003V5OO9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault Girls</a>&nbsp;by the same director is obvious.  The two films have separate lives, but explore different themes within the same general framework.  I think the two should be seen as complimentary rather than an original and a remake.

Avalon fights genres, and tells an engaging story in a world close to this one and a world clearly removed from this one.  The different layers, the relationships, the action all work together to make this one worth while.

1922451,2,B0000D9PNY,"Ridiculously over-hyped, overblown and thankfully - over there.

Basically, I'm over it.

I'm not sure I'm watching the same film as so many of the reviewers here.

Have a strong suspicion I'm dealing with drooling fanboys slobbering over their manga and anime discs next to a film guide thesaurus to bolster their unrequited love.

I get that this is supposed to be a dystopian drama - dark, ugly, claustrophobic, a populace faced with hopelessness in a dingy monochromatic world. And I guess this Japanese/Russian film does convey that appropriately.

But it's the tired retread of a screenplay itself that does it in, at least in my opinion.

The story of a 'young star' that will rock the staid establishment - someone who will go farther than any other person ever has - is far from an original plot. I can think of a dozen films that has that as the main storyline. So it's on shoulders of the writers/director to find a unique angle to accommodate their vision. Avalon fails in this most important and basic requirement.

She hears a rumor that the interactive online gaming system she has mastered, Avalon, has a secret level - a level guarded by something so bizarre that the few players that have faced it are invariably left brain dead. This includes her former teammate and team leader, who now resides in a hospital bed, lost in a permanent vegetative state.

Her goal: Locate the secret level, defeat it and move into a world that can't be imagined.

Unoriginal and decidedly bland. And the ending is oh-so-predictable it borders on satire.

It has an interesting look to it. Sort of a diseased yellow-brown tone, similar to Lars Von Trier's ""The Element of Crime."" The effects are good, but that's really about it. The storytelling is really clunky. It's a decent enough idea where some people in a run down world play an illegal virtual reality game called Avalon. Our heroine is good at it and struggles whether to get to the top going solo or enlist the help of her old team.

The script just isn't smooth and the fact that the game is illegal is not really dealt with at all. I thought it would have been a lot more interesting if the authorities were ready to bring the hammer down on the whole thing just as the final destination were being reached but somehow the film makers never thought of that.

2) Didn't understand the connection between the dog disappearing and the setup of the mission. Where did it go .. how did it get out of the apartment?

3) For the final part, I got the impression that the producers ran out of ideas and money. No great visuals, just a woman walking around a city trying to find someone who is an intruder. Does she find him .. we never find out? Plus the music score from the first part is repeated and takes up a large part of the 3rd part .. nothing new here.

An interesting story that has just enough clues to make it possible to follow, but with a few surprises and a few unanswered questions. But the best part of this movie is the music of Kenji Kawai that has a life of its own and will keep you rewinding the credits to hear it again and again. It appears that the Warsaw Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra played much of the background music, and the quality is stunning. There is much to criticize in this film too, as there are too many unanswered questions left to the imagination of the viewer. When do we leave the game and reenter reality, or is reality the game, and Avalon is the only way to find a world worth exploring. And how can the main character go on for days without eating? Welcome to Avalon.

The DVD of the movie is cheaper than the CD of the movie music.  Cant quite figure that out, but if you get it just for the music, it is well worth it.  This is Kawai's best work and for me it makes the movie.",1206921600,5,1157,4.347222222222222
1922470,4,B0000D9PNY,"Avalon is a tough movie to review.  On the one hand its a slow, methodical sci-fi movie that is visually stunning, but seems to be overly long and unnecessarily obtuse.  On the flip side its measured pace and ability to present themes and questions but no answers make is a intriguing movie, one that can provide a viewer with multiple viewings.

Even someone who is bored or confused by the film will agree that it is visually unique and leaning toward beautiful.  Oshii's ability to capture images, and create moods with his visuals is in full force here.  As others have noted, this film captures the visual coolness of Oshii's animation.  The use of color is clever and delivers a solid (but not unexpected) punch at the end of the movie.  In addition to some interesting effects work for the game world, the movie also creates an intricate real world that Ash inhabits.  The location filming in Poland adds to the overall feel of the film.

The acting is a mixed bag.  Foremniak plays Ash as supercool ice goddess.  She's tough, silent and stone faced.  However this makes her difficult to read and can pose a problem for an audience looking for clues in her acting.  On the flip side Gudejko as Murphy seems a bit over the top in most of his scenes.  Sometimes it works, other times, it misses.  I'm sure that most of this is intentional, but as I mentioned it might put more viewers off than draw them in.

Sound and music work hand in hand to create mood and deliver some great moments.  I think the music impressed me the most.  It seems to be given quite a focus in this film (especially in the final third of the movie).  Kenji Kawai does a great job with the score and uses his minimal approach and combines it with some excellent work by the Warsaw Philharmonic.  The result is a score that fits the movie pretty well, but I think would work wonderfully on it's own.

As for the script it's a difficult beast.  Dialogue (in the Polish version) is streamlined to the point that confusion will occur for any viewer not paying attention.  On top of that  is Oshii's tendency to layer theme after theme in his movie.  Those looking for easy answer to ""what it all means"" are going to be disappointed.  This is a movie to viewed, absorbed and reviewed.  It's not an action movie.  It's more of a pure sci-fi movie, full of ideas and questions, but leaving it up to the audience to come up with answers if they need them.

I recommend the movie.  It's not as dense and visual as ""Innocence: Ghost in the Shell 2"" and it's not as streamlined as the original ""Ghost in the Shell"".  It falls somewhere in between.  But fans of Oshii's work and fans of unique sci-fi films should check this one out.

**A Note**

I hear that the region 1 version of this film has been altered.  Mostly it's in the color scheme of the film and the English Dub (which goes to great lengths to explain what doesn't or shouldn't be explained).  These are minor irritations, but valid ones for people who insist on pure version of their movies.  I enjoyed the region 1 (at least they gave you the option of watching it in Polish), but would like to know for certain if it was tampered with in the color department.",1180915200,2,3195,4.437177280550775

1922472,4,B0000D9PNY,"A woman is addicted to an illegal war game.  She's one of the top warriors of the game and even makes her living by playing it.  Her goal is to be the first to complete it.  Along the way she learns of a secret level that can only be accessed by top players.  Unlike the rest of the game, once you enter this level there is no going back.  If you die - you die in real life, but if you win....

I thought the premise of the movie was pretty interesting, but I had read a couple of bad reviews about it.  After seeing it, I have to disagree.  I thought this was a VERY interesting movie.

The movie itself is slow moving and ""arty"" by nature, which is probably where it received the poor reviews.  Because the game is a war game, I can see where some people would get the notion that it would have more action and thrills.  However, the point of the movie is not the game.  The focus is her and how her life is wrapped up in the game - not the game itself.  So please keep that in mind before deciding to purchase/view the movie.

One of the best features is that the movie starts off with dull shades and once Ash proceeds to the secret level, everything is flooded with rich colors.  It really helps to set the theme.  Also the slower pace helps create the atmosphere that she lives in.  It has a quicker pace during the game and very slow in the real world.  Another interesting aspect is that the movie was by a Japanese crew, but the actors were Polish, which only adds to the unique style of the film.

The cons of the flick were character development and special effects.  It would have enhanced the movie a bit more if they went into better detail of what happened to Ash when she was in team ""Wizard.""  (They give the basics, but not enough to help the audience identify with her.)  This would give more credit to her loner-style.  As for special effects - given that they probably didn't have a high budget to start and the year it was made they did a decent job, but having a faster paced game with more intense explosions (and not quite so much dust) it might have made it a bit more suspenseful.

Overall I'd give it a 4.  Although this movie is good already, it has mass potential in a remake.",1152576000,,2206,4.170616113744076

This movie does have a neat premise....and that's where it ends.  There is no character development to speak of, and the movie suffers for it.  So even if you don't give a hoot about the characters, you at least want to see the execution of the premise.

The beautiful soundtrack alone should be enough to entice a person to watch it, yet Avalon's story, ideas, visuals, and all the other perfectly balanced elements make this entire film near perfect.

The lovely blend of quirky visuals, perfectly implemented music, and very strong characters and story make Avalon no less than a stunning experience.

Though science fiction or action fans will not be dissapointed, Avanlon is a nicely paced story about life, about people, and about their escapes from reality - perhaps even coming to show that reality is no more than interpreted fantasy.

1922475,4,B0000D9PNY,"There are thousands of films with a similar premise, but I would like to mention how very much I enjoy director Mamoru Osh's (also known as Oshii) work. Recently I had the privilege of watching Avalon (2001 also named ""Gate to Avalon""), a Japanese film by the mastermind behind Ghost in the Shell and Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.

While the original Ghost in the Shell and Innocence (its sequel) were both about the subjective nature of reality, Avalon differs from them in that its live action instead of animated. With possible nihilistic implications as well as being jam packed with countless other philosophical and literary references (both symbolic as well as obvious), his films - especially Avalon - touch upon important issues while being quite enjoyable works of art.

The themes discussed in Ghost in the Shell as well as its implications were profound - the same themes yet applied differently

in Innocence were presented in a cinematically beautiful way (the art and animation was remarkable): while the themes were more obvious throughout Avalon, the film manages to fit the director's ""style"" perfectly. While the themes of nihilism were present in bleak scenes which were sparsely furnished as well as vanishing objects and individuals, the subjective ontological references were often mentioned by the films character to provide clarity to the average viewer.

I didn't care... it actually managed to make the film even more enjoyable - I didn't have the brain power at the moment to sit there and think about the film, I simply wanted something to entertain me.

Cinematically the film fares well too - as mentioned sparsely populated areas throughout the film contribute to the film's overall

affect, as does the film's coloration (the film is almost entirely filmed in what appears to be sepia, which is in actuality a deep orange color contributing to the themes present as one finds out toward the films ending). From futuristic at times (barren for the most part and devoid of people), to more modern settings are explored thoughout the movie.

The soundtrack of the film lacks somewhat in substance in comparison with Ghost in the Shell and Innocence - to be honest I can only

remember one song from the entire movie! The song I remember was actually an opera-orchestral piece put together strictly for Avalon and it did well to contribute to the film's emotional undertones. For any fan of music found within Osh's films I would highly recommend purchasing the imported soundtrack from Innocence.

I recently read a review online which stated that the English dubbed version (the one I had seen), had words added to the voice soundtrack to help the American viewer understand the story. Amusing and somewhat disappointing - I should very much like to see the Japanese version, but I think it's safe to say the majority of viewers would understand the film without such ""hand-holding"" insertions (as one individual referred to them as, which sounds quite offensive and I doubt the validity of such a claim).

As most of his work goes, this movie is great food for thought! Looking for a sci-fiaction picture with a ""deeper"" storyline than most? Feel free to give this movie a try as well, you won't be disappointed... anyway you look at it, this is a creative masterpiece.",1134000000,2,3302,4.954792043399638
1922476,5,B0000D9PNY,"This is a cool film but it doesn't tell you what it's about and thus can only be fully appreciated if the viewer deduces it for themselve-and most havn't.......Rest of review contains spoiler:

 It's a ""bladerunner"" for BOTS i believe, Ash, and all the characters in the film are BOTS. Their real world is part of the game, avalon, designed so that the bots think they are real and therefore when they play the game, they act more realisticly for the real players.
 Some of the bots in the game who are getting destoyed are probably the real players of the game, but from the bots perspective they are bots.  The whole thing makes perfect sense from this angle, explains the oddities, characteristics and cold nature of the characters and their askewed ""real"" world. This is why they are drawn to the reality of the game and also the hidden reality level that 'Murphy' is in; this extra-class A world is in fact an ""upgraded"" world or ""mod"", mayby still in development as the newest installment of the game world.
 So it's a moral question of the more realistic BOTS get in a game the more they want to be real According to this film, they do, as they are all searching and playing for a more real experience, the better the simulation the more real they feel. That is why Murphy won't go back but he seems to think that the new level is his real home, when Ash kills him i think she realises that she is a bot.
 So fascinating to watch when you are clued into the real story but can an edgy 5 as hard to enjoy the film off the bat as much as it should be, since story is presented as an un-answered brainteaser. I really like the subtle/atmospheric story telling syle, is like anime in that way, but would of been good if there was some kind of extra that explained the story properly.",1132963200,,1786,4.364457831325301
1922486,5,B0000D9PNY,"Okay, first things first. AVALON is NOT a slam-bang shoot 'em up bullet-time orgy of destruction, so if that's what you're expecting, please skip a couple DVD's to the right and grab James Cameron's ALIENS instead.  What AVALON may lack in high-testosterone thrills it more than makes up in mood, atmosphere and thought-provoking reflection which in my humble opinion makes this film (not I didn't call it a ""movie"") an absolute masterpiece.  Don't get me wrong, I like seeing things blow up good every now and again, but AVALON doesn't strive to be a pyrotechnic wire-fu spectacle. Instead, AVALON is a successful mesh of darkly dreamlike cyberpunk aesthetic and European arthouse Noir. It's sense of style lends it an immediate and powerful legitimacy, and the ambiguous nature of the story from start to non-conclusion demands repeat viewings, none of which ever get old.

Malgorzata Foremniak is pitch perfect (and absolutely mesmerizing) as Ash, the coldly reclusive central character through who's eyes we experience a morose, near-Orwellian future where an illegal VR game called Avalon seems to be the only way to break the monotony of bleak existence, as well as rake in a modest living.

The few action sequences within the game are thrilling and imaginative, but it's the quieter moments that really grab your attention. That, coupled with the overall sense of displaced reality, is the magic of AVALON.

Much has been made of AVALON's thematic similarities to The Matrix, but it's important to remember that the Wachowski's ripped off Ghost In The Shell first, a fact which Mamoru Oshii is well aware of and puts to good use in AVALON.

Also, regarding the so-called ""subtitle timing"" issue following the in-game opening sequence, it's Ash's THOUGHTS that are subtitled, which is why they appear when she isn't talking. A very clever approach.

The lush orchestral score provided by Kenji Kawai (Ghost In The Shell 1 and 2) adds a further layer of respectability to AVALON, enhancing the emotions while at the same time strengthening the dreamlike nature of the narrative.

Skip the rental and make AVALON a permanent addition to your DVD library. It's as perfect as they come.",1130284800,10,2189,5.061111111111111
1922487,5,B0000D9PNY,"Ash is the central character. She lives her life in the game, Avalon, and spends all those non-game moments building up the paycheck to pay for it. The special effects are unworldly, the kind you'd expect if you weren't real and your mainframe glitched. That's where Ash lives, though, in the world where experience points are all that matters. It's just a game, right? You play, and lose or win, and play again.

Then it all changes. Nothing changed, really, except that everything changed. The game turns real, maybe. Or maybe it did a long time ago. Or maybe it didn't.

Watch for color in this movie. Reality, or something like it, has color. Everything else is yellow, like that acid sodium lamp in the parking lot, but with a brimstone tinge. Almost everything is yellow - but not the meat or rice. Color, in this movie, is real. Or something like it.

1922488,4,B0000D9PNY,"Avalon is sci-fi in the same vein as Ghost in the Shell (also by the same director), but without the political intrigue of that movie.  It's not as heady and confusing as Existenz, so don't expect a lot of plot twists.  The plot is pretty straightforward: people in the future play a virtual reality video game for fun and (some) for profit.  It's illegal, but no one seems to care; in fact, there are no police around or any mention of the government at all.  The story follows the exploits of Ash, one of the best players of the game ""Avalon"", and her efforts to reach the ultimate level (coincidentally also called ""Avalon"").  Don't expect a lot of action here; the fighting is very confusing and mostly serves as a backdrop for the movie's main theme, which could be interpreted as ""How does one define one's reality?""  The main thrust of the story is that the real world is boring, explored through many drawn-out shots of Ash doing normal day-to-day activities over and over, and the game is not exactly real, but more exciting.

There are a few annoying things about the movie: the game world (except at the end) is rendered in a yellowish-tint monochrome, which diminishes the action scenes quite a bit.  Many scenes are repeated over and over, to establish the monotony of everyday life, but this gets old pretty fast.  On the plus side, the plot is very easy to follow and interesting.  The music is excellent, and even though it's in Polish, you'll be humming it later.  If you're a war buff (especially post-WWII), expect to see a lot of military hardware from that era.  The sheer variety of weapons used is impressive in it's own right.

Even though this review seems very negative, the movie overall is very good, but not great.  It's worth buying though, especially if you're a fan of Oshii.

On a technical note, there was a timing issue with the english subtitles in some of the scenes near the beginning of the movie.  This issue made it difficult to understand what was going on, but in subsequent viewings, you can piece things together.",1128384000,,2058,4.628099173553719

After reading other comments here, it does not take long to note that reviewers are either full of praise or downright critical, with little in between. Not many movies are so provocative. I stumbled onto this film late one night at the local video rental and it was like my last option, so I had little or no expectations to be deflated. I was pleasantly surprised. The sombre ambiance of the surroundings (Poland) enchanted me, and the sepia black & white film stock simply added to the mystique of the setting. Indeed I have not experienced such a rich atmosphere in a sci-fi film since Blade Runner!!! The SLIGHTLY low-tech special effects were incredible in that they seemed to add authenticity to the fact that this was a ""video game"" NOT ""reality"", unlike a lot of sci-fi where the special effects are merely another prop. The insular existence of the lead character due to her obsession with her virtual world is perhaps very poignant today more than ever with the advent of cyber space, computer games etc and their potential for social alienation. Perhaps the films shortcoming is that it may not appeal to the younger set who have grown up on a heavy diet of Hollywood Blockbusters where there has to be the mandatory car chase and subsequent sex followed by a gratuitous helping of ultra violence, but for me that was part of this very artistic films charm.",1117238400,5,1434,4.67193675889328
1922490,2,B0000D9PNY,"The near future: Some young people deal with their disillusionment by participating in an illegal virtual reality war game.  Its simulated thrills and deaths are compulsive and addictive.  Some players, working in teams called &#8220;parties&#8221; even earn their living from the game.  The game is named after the legendary island where the souls of departed heroes come to rest: Avalon.  For Ash, an expert player, only 3 levels are left in order for her to conquer the game.  She usually plays solo but this time she knows she will need a partner because the levels are bound to get harder and harder...

Sounds like a blast right?  A wet dream come true for sci-fi and cyberpunk fans?  So I thought but Avalon is nothing but one big snooze, a movie deceivingly packaged as something it's not.  It started off on the right foot, with an intense 10-minute action sequence showing Ash blasting her way through one of the levels of the game.  After that it's all downhill.  Between the first 10 minutes of action and the final 10 minutes of action, the movie veers towards emotionalism and existentialism that is not in the least interesting, the whole film moving at a snail's pace.  Ok, so maybe Avalon was intentionally not meant to be a fast-paced action film but rather a character study about one of its players.  Problem is, Ash is not in the least bit an interesting character.  She is a withdrawn person who spends the whole time moping, feeling depressed and feeling sorry for herself.  We are never really told why she is such an unhappy person or where her single-minded obsession for the game originated from.

It's too bad because if it had been done right, Avalon could have succeeded, it does have a few good things going for it.  In true cyberpunk fashion, the city is presented to us, convincingly, as a bleak and fascist place.  When Ash does strap on to that reclining chair and puts on her game helmet (in a scene directly lifted out of The Matrix, which itself lifted the scene directly off Ghost in the Shell) the images are striking.  The game levels are a dream-like visual feast of decayed walled cities and those sets just brim with desolation and atmosphere.  But as I mentioned previously the first 10 minutes are like that, the last 10 minutes are like that and the rest is an insomnia cure about poor old pouting Ash.

Don't let the plot summary or box packaging fool you.  This film is not a virtual reality adventure.  It's a joke. It's such a shame too because I really love this type of movie.

1922492,4,B0000D9PNY,"Avalon, not to be confused with a couple of unrelated though very good films with the same name, is a deeply haunting and powerful film, set in urban Poland, and directed by anime legend, director Mamoru Oshii. This is a landmark achievement in film-making, but admittedly its story and message are dated.

Avalon the film is about life centered around Avalon, a virtual reality combat game. The game parallels the MUDs and MMORPGs we know today. Sadly, one darker aspect of Avalon (addiction and the possibility of ending up comatose) reflects unfortunate realities some have faced playing MMORPGs. The central character in Avalon is Ashe, a female player of the game. Ashe is a legend in her own right, a warrior-class player and member of a legendary but fallen team, Team Wizard. She now plays Avalon Solo. After a chance encounter with a former teammate that leads to her discovery that their former team captain and friend had been ""lost"" while trying to reach the end of the game, Ashe becomes focused on reaching the game's highest (and most personally dangerous) levels.

Avalon is a slow paced film. Do not expect fast-paced action from start to finish. I would say that this film is even slower than the The Matrix sequals and Blade Runner. Unless you truly love cinema and are not adverse to anything other than action flicks, you will likely find this movie boring. What may stand out to viewers is the apparent connection between this film, The Matrix, and Bladerunner. The latter film influenced Avalon just as it did every feature film within the Cyperpunk subgenre. This isn't surprising. What is notable is that Avalon shares a common ancestry with The Matrix. Oshii's Ghost in the Shell served as a central influence for The Matrix. Avalon, in turn, has borrowed some of its special effects and concepts from The Matrix.

The CG work is done in a style that intentionally depicts a virtual world where things are only semi-realistic contrasting a real world that is lifeless. This is important to note as the CG used in the film might lead some viewers to erroneously compare this movie by today's CG standards. The urban Eastern European settings is perfect at depicting a miserable real-world existence, making it easy to understand why people flock in droves to the Avalon game.

Oshii, a master of anime, uses his anime roots to emphasize emotion and reveal some of Avalon's backstory through subtle details. For example, posters in the fashion of anti-drug ads line walls calling for people to stop playing Avalon. The most apparent detail will be use of color in this film. Without giving too much of the story away, the film has a constant muted half-tone color wash. Miramax's DVD release adds a heavier shade of orange over the original. This may be comfortable for some viewers. I didn't feel any eye strain myself watching this movie in the dark though. My only complaint about this movie is that, occasionally, scenes go on without advancing the plot, a typical complaint I have of Oshii's work in anime.

The extras on this DVD are worthwhile. There is a documentary discussing the story and special effects used. The picture is presented in Widescreen 1.85 format, enhanced for widescreen TVs. The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround in the original Polish, English, and French tracks.",1098057600,8,3331,4.888495575221239
1922493,3,B0000D9PNY,"The genre is its big problem. The setting and proposition of the movie have been done so many times before that the beauty and subtlety of its work gets lost in the influence of other movies. We suppose that if a viewer were seeing this movie for the first time without ever seeing any of its ancestors it would become a lot more important to them. Sadly, because it itself is so heavily influenced, it will become merely interesting in the minds of the viewing public. And that's a shame because it's really more important than that.

They will find it a deeply satisfying experience vindicating what they've always suspected: anim is doing some of the best and most original work and there's no reason it couldn't choose a live-action presentation if it so desired. Viewers who are interested in reality bending work like The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor et. al. will also find a lot of satisfaction in this film. It might resonate best of all with those people who are or have been addicted to virtual gaming experiences where friends and enemies are made and personalities both assumed and real leap to the fore. On an oddly related note, people who love older mystery films in the mold of Hitchcock and To Catch a Thief may also find this film very satisfying since the pacing and characterization are very similar though with a certain Japanese minimalism.

WHO SHOULD AVOID:

The aforementioned ""smash mouth"" viewer who is interested in lots of action, lots of bullets, lots of marshal arts, sex, and special effects will likely be very disappointed. There is some action but its very ancillary to the movie and done so only to create the character--for it is the game that creates the character rather than their words or the settings of their homes. And don't expect the surfeit of blood and sex that came with Ghost in a Shell--it's not here. We're sort of baffled by the R-rating, actually. This movie requires that a viewer be well-versed in either gaming or science-fiction or, preferably--both. If you have no interest in these subjects then this is not a good learning experience for you. You'll be puzzled and sort of annoyed at what is really a very good movie.

1922494,5,B0000D9PNY,"Nice to see Oshii putting out this great film. As others have stated, it is a slow paced cyberpunk fantasy though done wonderfully. I would like to see the original directors version after reading here that MIRAMAX changed it. English dubbing is very good. Watch it with subtitles for full effect though. If you like Anime, cyberpunk, or other such films as Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Tron (one of the only GREAT disney movies) then you'll love this one.",1093305600,,461,4.703703703703703
1922495,5,B0000D9PNY,"I am writing this only to help counteract some of the idiocy in other reviews. This movie is not for everyone: no movie is. It is a beautifully shot, wonderfully sculpted, slow-paced, and thought-provoking movie. It does not hand the answers to you on a plate, and that may bother some people, particularly those lazy viewers who rely on Hollywood films to tell them what to think with no room for imagination.

 It is not a rip-off of The Matrix. If anything, it's derivative of Oshii's earlier films and thought, which heavily influenced The Matrix. I also loved Ghost in the Shell for many of the same reasons that I liked Avalon. It has some of the pacing of Taste of Cherry. It allows a person to settle in, relax, and absorb all of the deliciousness of the style of the movie and to get inside Ash, the heroine.

 The special features are worth seeing. The director is very clear in his interview what his thoughts and intent are in the film. This film is a piece of art, and as such it allows each person to take from it what they want. I can understand people not liking it, but it cannot be denied that this film was done with care and passion and expresses the vision of an interesting person.

 There are so many movies out there that are merely eye candy, like the recent Star Wars films, that are so bad otherwise. And so many movies that rely on violence or special effects and are wholly unoriginal but satisfy the kind of viewer who laments how his girlfriend fell asleep and who calls the director, ""pretentious."" There are few people in the world with the creativity, passion, and artistic sense of this director.

 Avalon is not the greatest movie ever made, or even in the top 100, but it is far better than most of the dreck released each week, and it is a movie that makes you think and stays with you. It is worth seeing by anyone who enjoys something a little different and has the patience and courage to use their own brain and not have a movie that's spoon-fed to them.

 And then there's the wonderful basset hound.",1090540800,32,2043,4.424
1922505,1,B0000D9PNY,"I got my hands on this DVD after catching the first five minutes of the movie being projected on a warehouse wall with a backdrop of thumping industrial techno. The opening scenes were rather impressive - an illegal, potentially lethal video game in which people get online, strap on military hardware and set about killing each other. Although I'm not a fan of online gaming (I'm crap at first person shooters), I thought it looked and sounded like a cool premise. So I went home and found a copy.
The first five minutes, again, were fantastic. A moderately fast-paced battle scene with awesome tech and lots of things blowing up. Fun. But then 'reality' struck.
I've long been annoyed by the sort of pseudo-symbolism that Japanese movie makers seem to like drowning their creations in. Usually it's pretentious and annoying, but it does serve to cover up the incredibly shallow plots of most Japanese animes and movies. For instance, want to have giant robots that exist for no real reason fighting monsters that continuously show up for no real reason in a post-apocalyptic world that has no reason to exist? Add a faux-Biblical subtext and you have Evangelion (which I thought was otherwise very cool).
Avalon is different. Instead of taking a shallow, unworkable pretext and slaps in a half carried-through set of (cool and ominous sounding) mythical symbolisms from another culture to add some depth, Avalon takes a monumentally workable and interesting idea and adds a crappy mythological overtone to completely deprive the movie of depth.
So many things could have been covered - why the world was so miserable, why the game killed some people and under what conditions, how laws banning the game were supposedly enforced, how the clans interacted in the game, and even how the unbelievably cool idea of preserving Dungeons and Dragons style character classes in a modern warfare game would work. These are all completely ignored in favour 90-something minutes of sepia-toned still scenes emphasising how dreary the world and city is, and cryptic but ultimately pointless references to some aspects of Arthurian legend.
The protagonists are wooden, stereotypical and unlikeable. Character development is nil. The battle scenes are few and far between, and the first one is the only good one. For the most part, even the most powerful machines lack weight and aren't particularly threatening, and even if they were, it is hard to bring yourself to care about what happens to any of the characters anyway. To top it off, the soundtrack (or lack thereof) is minimalist to the point of non-existence.
The movie ends, leaving a bad taste in your mouth. That bad taste is the taste of having had an hour and a half of your life taken away from you by a horribly pretentious Japanese gentleman. My girlfriend was put to sleep by the slow pace and dreary setting of this movie, and even after I returned the DVD to the store the next day she didn't trust me to chose another movie for weeks.
Avalon is truly awful. While some people seem to like it for some sort of artistic value, I found it to be pretentious and ultimately devoid of value. It takes some great ideas and ignores them entirely. Any movie which wanted to subsequently explore those ideas which Avalon discarded would be decried as a rip off and probably sued. That's probably the worst thing about Avalon. Do not watch it.",1087430400,14,3389,4.865051903114187
1922506,3,B0000D9PNY,"Here we go again. MIRAMAX basterdizes another movie. MIRAMAX tends to buy the rights to these great movies & then changes them. I've seen the original AVALON so I can comment on what's been changed. First, the original washed out color of the film is replaced with an deep orange. This really ruins some of the original scenes. At least some colors in the original movie came out. MIRAMAX has ruined the directors vision. If you have this DVD see the extras on the cinamatography & SFX. At least there you'll see the original color that was intended by director Mamoru Oshii. The 2nd thing that's been added is the additoinal dialogue. The main chracter explains the game after her 1st victory. This has been added by MIRAMAX. And lastly at the end or character explains it all or tries to. All this was added to the movie. The directors intention is to make you guess & ponder this wonderful story. But MIRAMAX has decided for you. About the only thing I'll give them credit is the great English dub. I also enjoyed the extras. I have to give this 3 stars. If you can write a protest letter to MIRAMAX. It's so sad how a american Distributor can tamper & ruin a directors vision. I'd recommend getting a foreign version of this movie if you can.",1082246400,85,1246,4.493392070484582

1922508,4,B0000D9PNY,"I will not go into the details of the plot since they have been covered by others. I will just say that as weird as this movie ""noir"" was, I actually liked it. What tilted the scale in its' favor was featuring Ash's Bassett Hound. My favorite type dog, that old hound made the movie for me! At first I thought the dog was either kidnapped or dead, but when Ash goes to the ""real"" world, you see the dog flopping his chops out the window of a car going by. Too cool! My biggest criticism is that whoever did the subtitles needs a few grammar lessons. Ouch! But overall, if you are looking for a weird trip, and do not expect to see a Matrix clone (which it is not), and do not mind reading through sometimes rapidly changing subtitles, it is a good movie. And that dog is icing on the cake!",1079913600,,789,4.12987012987013
1922509,5,B0000D9PNY,"I am shocked to see the review which says that Oshiisan has copied the concept of Avalon from Matrix .The whole concept of plugging in,  right down to the plug points on the neck of the characters, has been ripped off in Matrix from Oshiisans Ghost in the shell,he does not have to steal what is his,second please, Trinity is a human clone of major Kusanagi of Ghost  right down to the way she fights, and the lobby shootout is clearly inspired by the
shootout in the last shootout in Ghost ""bits of concrete flying everywhere"" etc, and even the poses when characters land after making a leap are copied from ghost ""on one knee"".Avalon is for people who like Japanese Anime which over the years has inspired the likes of Matrix. And this is something the Wachowski's themselves admit. And a good movie can be in any language for one to appreciate ,I couldn't care if it was russian or polish. I think
people should refrain from tearing down something which they don't know much about.",1077667200,20,984,4.553672316384181
1922510,5,B0000D9PNY,"The five star rating is really only for people who don't just sit down and ""watch"" a movie.  If your like most people, who need every thing spelled out for them word for word, who needs to see someone getting shot to death from every possible angle, who needs to see body parts better left covered, and who needs a quick shot of entertainment that doesen't even require brain stimulation, then this movie isn't for you.  If you do not fall under this catagorization, then enjoy, it's a five star for sure!
What I mean by ""a person who doesen't just 'watch' a movie"" is someone who isn't done rolling the concept around in their head the moment the ending credits start.  If a movie doesen't stick with you, and doesen't make you think, then whats the point?  While your sitting there doing nothing you may as well be at least using your brain.  If you just want to sit down and zone out when you watch movies, then fine, don't watch this film.  I hope I never turn into one of you.",1077321600,2,981,4.333333333333333
1922511,4,B0000D9PNY,"It is unfortunate that we've been so jaded by the Hollywood version of what a film should be that we would pass up the nuances that can make an otherwise mediocre film into a great film, albeit if mainly for its cinematographic value.  Some appear to have judged Avalon, and the efforts of its director (Oshii), within this context--even presuming that the film is nothing more than a bad Matrix wannabe.  This is not the case, in my view.
I much prefer to be enticed by subtle details and given an opportunity to become immersed in mood than bombarded with a lot of special effects and high-flying acrobatics.  This is what I found to be so refreshing about this movie.
As for providing explanations to everything, well, I don't know that that is always needed in a film in order for it to be entertaining.  So is it that I find it interesting that our Western mindset cannot deal with finding deeper meanings, through our own interpretations, in most anything that we encounter.  It's as if we expect to pause our brains and be entertained through mere visual stimulation.  Of course, I know that this is not really what others have described.  Still, this is the type of movie that I believe deserves better than what I've read in these reviews.  It's funny that I say all this and it was precisely the visuals that made the film so endearing.  There's nothing passe about achieving a high level of beauty in a film, and we are fortunate to have ""some"" directors still mindful of this growingly archaic attention to detail.",1076976000,11,1526,4.622222222222222

Avalon is a completely different take on a similar theme, anomie.  It has less to do with artificial intelligence and more to do with the dreams and hopes of youth.  How detached the youth of today feel from the modern world and the false ethics of the ruling class is a subtle undertone in this exploration of what is ""real"" and what control we have over our own lives.
""Why does our hero only feel alive when she is in Avalon?"" is the question we are asking ourselves when we are viewing this thoughtful film.  Why do we only feel alive when we vicariously experience the seductive lives of our science fiction heroes...",1076112000,3,795,4.545454545454546

One, I'm a gamer and I've often marveled at how the virtual reality offered by games offer a total, complete escape from real life.  Good or bad - this movie really makes us consider this.  For a movie that was done on a lower budget, I've seen very few that are as interesting as this.  As some have said, it's made for artistic or philosophical reasons rather than for entertainment.  I would agree, with the addendum that if you are a gamer AND a thinker, this will be particularly entertaining.  The plot is great but is developed slowly - on purpose.  The acting is not bad, as some have said.  Instead, I find that the director did so many thing intensionally.  I get kicks out of that.  There are a great many things to notice in this film.
