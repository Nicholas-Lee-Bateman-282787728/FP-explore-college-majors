8713143,5,B00WFHU2EK,"The future of the world as defined & controlled by 0.01% of the worlds wealthiest people!!

This documentary outlines how 0.01% of the worlds people control 99.9% of the worlds people!!!

The members of this group operate in total secrecy andvtheirvsafety and secrecy are protected by groups like the US Secret Service!!

These people do not have the best interest of 99.9% of the worlds people as a concern, or even a consideration.

They have only the best interest of themselves and their financial gain as their consideration!!!

Bildererg Group, and Trilateral Commission are just two of the groups.

One of their main goals is perpetual war, because war feeds the profits of many, many industries which they control and profit from.

Bill & Hillary Clinton are Bilderberg Group Golden Children, as is Barrack Obama!!! These three are known to have been invited to the summits in which all of the major deisions of the world are made.
It is through the power and financial support of the Blderberg Group that Barrack Obama was elected and where Barrack Obama received the direction he was required to follow for this country during his entire Presidency, and it is also where Hillary Clintons recent political windfall in her run for the US President has come from.

If Hillary Clinton is elected as President this November this 0.01% of the worlds wealthiest and most powerful people will once again continue to have total control of the United States of America!!!

The rich will get richer, and the Middle Class in America will continue to see a decline of their income and future potential as more MILLIONS of jobs will be sent permanently overseas.
The TPP will take effect and the wealthiest people and corporations will have even more power. This power will include the power to sue, in a rigged court system controlled by the very people that these decisions will benefit, the US government and US companies if they do anything that takes away from the profit of the wealthiest people and corporations in the world.",1467676800,,2028,4.872093023255814
