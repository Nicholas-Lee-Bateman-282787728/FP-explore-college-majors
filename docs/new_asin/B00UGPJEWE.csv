It begins with a comic western movie based on a magazine story. Should the stories be up to date? They made the author rich. A letter invites the author to visit her Mystery Ranch to see the real West. This will give that ranch an economic boost. What if that writer doesnt like this Mystery Ranch? That write and his secretary detrain to a noisy greeting. The secretary puts his wrong foot in the stirrup! The writer sees an apparent hanging. Next Morris the writer halts the horses. Robert Morris sees two men shooting at each other. Can it be stopped? Its a free country. They put a burr under Morris saddle as a trick. [A long shot for a stunt double.] I cant imagine how that happened. Theres a report on stolen steers, they ride after them.

Did they put it over on him? Morris catches the two rustlers and gives on a spanking! Robert and Percy see a hold up; another gag? Two men have car trouble and start walking. Robert overhears a conversation. Those two men ask for help with their car. Robert and Percy plan a trick of their own, but a man overhears them and reverses the gold and iron. Percy stages a hold up and leaves. But another man suggests a joke. The Sheriff arrives and arrests those two men, then Robert as the gold is gone! After they leave the two robbers overpower their guard and escape. Percy tells Robert about the joke, so he goes after them. The Sheriffs posse rides up after Robert knocked those two men down. Mary asks Robert if she will be in the story. Only if the hero gets the heroine.

It is rare to see a movie that parodies the Western movies of that era, but the comedy makes it worth viewing. Its still entertaining today.",1506211200,,1690,4.375796178343949
