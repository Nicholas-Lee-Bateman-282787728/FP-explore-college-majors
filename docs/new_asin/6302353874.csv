7824670,3,6302353874,"Here's the 3rd scanner movie, where scanners want to form a syndicate and take over first the city, then maybe the world. New tallents are developed here and is very interesting if it ever becomes a reality. Sort of spooky if you think about it.",1339200000,,245,4.466666666666667
7824671,4,6302353874,"""Scanners 3: The Takeover"" sees two adopted scanner siblings trying to live a normal life until the brother accidentally kills a friend, and moves to Thailand to run from his problems. His sister exposes herself to an experimental drug created to halt the headaches and voices that come with being a scanner. Unfortunately, side-affects include growing sadism and megalomania, and when brother gets back home, an inevitable conflict will ensue.

This is an odd but overall entertaining entry to the series. While not as brutal or thought-provoking as the first film or as action-packed as the second, it excels in one thing: this is the funny ""Scanners"" movie, intentional or otherwise. We the audience are exposed to one-liners, an exploding pigeon, gun-toting gangster scanners, and mugging galore. Seriously, it looks like if Jim Varney was a scanner. Add that up with the EXTREMELY sexy Liliana Komorowska and a number of always sweet gore FX, this one will blow your mind...away!",1295568000,3,984,5.15
7824672,2,6302353874,"Filled to the gullet with trepidation, I took out the third in the Canadian series about telekinetics and exploding heads.
The film makers this time try something new. A brother and sister team of scanners (but not the siblings from the second film) live a life of luxury. Their daddy is a scientist still trying to get that latest scanner drug right. The brother accidentally kills his best friend at a party by scanning him right out an open balcony door, and he leaves for a Buddhist monastery in Thailand (as all scanners are won't to do). Sis back home starts taking daddy's very experimental drug, and suddenly turns evil. She gets nekkid in a hot tub and scans daddy to death, taking over his position and starting, everybody now, ""AN EVIL CORPORATION."" What is with this series and capitalism? Anyway, bro comes back, he and sis argue all scanner like, and good triumphs over evil...again.
Surprisingly, the basic plot was not too bad. However, the whole evil corporation schtick is getting really old. Also unexplained is why the sister has a Polish accent, and the brother has a Canadian accent. Once again, there are lots of stunt people getting jerk roped through walls and windows and doors, and lots of blood and gore as heads and bodies explode. The love interest for the brother here is one of those smart and beautiful research scientists at the evil corporation whose character is completely naive as to the sister's goings-on. The scanners in this film do not just stare googly-eyed at their prey, they whip their heads at them like a groupie at a B-52's concert. I guess scanners do not get dizzy.
The Scanners series is like an exploding head: painful to watch but you cannot look away. ""Scanners III: The Takeover"" is underwhelming.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, and sexual content.",1022630400,4,1901,4.8343558282208585
