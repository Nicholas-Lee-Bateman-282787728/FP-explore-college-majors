3964969,2,B002PLMJ74,"Ok, I love dolphins, I loved Flipper, have watched hundreds of documentary films and am very independent in my social and political views.  That being said, this film is pure one-sided Hollywood crap.  Rather than rant endlessly about it, I'll just make the major points here:

1. The film is propaganda.  A viewer has no idea if the viewpoint is an honest depiction of the subject because it endlessly hits you over the head with a single perspective of the controversy.
2. When the dolphin trainer of Flipper starts talking about when Flipper committed suicide in his arms with the painting of a dolphin in the background was there some reason why the director didn't question his motives and mental state?
3. There is beautiful dolphin swimming footage.
4. The Industrial, Light and Magic team of Star Wars fame constructs elaborate fake blimps and rocks with super high tech HD cameras for a film on dolphins?  Where is this money coming from?  Didn't they stop to think that this money could be better spent on saving human lives in one of the many wars in the world or maybe stopping starvation/human traffiking/etc.?
5. This film is a great example of why there should be the same journalistic standards for documentaries as there are for any newspaper/online reporter.  This story wouldn't get past a high school journalism teacher.
6. It got into Sundance with its ""Flipper Trainer Wants To Save the Dolphins"" headline.  It made them money just like every other gimmicky film.  Sundance is dead.",1259366400,28,1504,4.866666666666666
3964970,5,B002PLMJ74,"The Cove was powerful, bold and informative. It totally changed me- I now have a ""cause"", I care about something and am passionate to put an end to this horrific slaughter. Watch this movie - it will move you.",1258588800,9,209,4.384615384615385
3964971,5,B002PLMJ74,"This is so much more than a documentary. You are drawn into the action of brining this important issue to light. A cause too few know about, the slaughter of dolphins in Japan, you get a true understanding of what goes on in that part of the world and what needs to be done to stop it. It does not get preachy or make you feel like you are being talked down to about ""not doing enough"". It has a true action movie feel with suspense but it is REAL! It makes you think about trips to SeaWorld or other marine parks and what really is going on there. A remarkable film and a cause that needs more attention.",1257465600,12,605,4.092436974789916
3964972,5,B002PLMJ74,"I'm a huge fan of documentary cinema and was excited but not necessarily expecting great things going into this one. After having left the theater I can honestly say that out of the hundreds of documentaries I have watched in my life this is by far the best filmed, the most engaging, and the most inspiring one I have ever seen. I knew and cared little about the Japanese dolphin slaughters before watching and left considering myself well informed and fairly passionate about the issue. If the ability to inspire is your criteria for a great documentary than I submit you can find no better documentary to purchase than this one.",1256515200,14,631,4.693693693693693

3964974,5,B002PLMJ74,"Perfect. With a mix of sadness and a bit of humor, this creative documentary delivers a strong message. I was surprised that not many people were in the theater. This is a must see movie for all ocean lovers and fans of Whale Wars. Highly recommended! (although not for the faint hearted as there are some very depressing scenes)",1250467200,13,329,4.593220338983051
3964975,4,B002PLMJ74,"The new documentary ""The Cove"" tells a story the Japanese government would rather not be made public.

Richard O'Barry, the principal subject of the film, wrestles with almost constant feelings of remorse. In the mid 60s, he served as the technical advisor for the successful television show ""Flipper""; he helped find, train and care for the dolphins who played the title character. The success of the series is viewed as the catalyst to the creation of ""Ocean Parks"" around the world, places like the various ""Sea World"" parks, where thousands of people visit every year to watch dolphins, whales and other sea creatures perform tricks. O'Barry learns of a small fishing village in Japan, Taijii, where the main business is to capture dolphins and herd them into captivity. They sell the best dolphins to parks, exhibits, ""swimming with dolphins"" type businesses and more, earning as much as $150,000 for the best of the best. But what do they do with the rest of these creatures? The ones that don't sell? O'Barry knows and he wants to expose the truth to the world in an effort to put a stop to it.

He enlists the aid of Louie Psihoyos, a documentary filmmaker, who assembles a team of people. They begin to gather all of the equipment they will need for the project and make many plans on how to infiltrate the secret areas before they set off for Japan. As soon as they arrive, the sheer amount of baggage (all of their equipment) catches the attention of the authorities and they are quickly under surveillance. The police visit O'Barry many times, each time trying to get him to admit his guilt. He doesn't trust them and they don't believe him.

As soon as they arrive in Taijii, O'Barry gives them a tour, always wearing a face mask, afraid some of the fishermen will kill him if they could get their hands on him. They pass a Dolphin Museum, complete with a happy, smiling dolphin painted on the side. O'Barry quickly explains how ironic this is.

Using techniques that are probably more common to a ""Mission Impossible"" sequel, they come up with a plan to infiltrate this heavily guarded area, place some hidden cameras and get some proof on film.

As we watch them go through these incredibly over the top security measures, the story slowly comes into focus. This is one of the most interesting elements of the story, of the film. Initially, O'Barry appears as though he could be a crackpot, the type of guy who probably smoked too many illegal substances once and now sees conspiracies around every corner. But as the story progresses, we start to see what he is talking about and realize he is right, just extremely passionate about the cause.

As he and the other volunteers work their way through the plan, we pick up more pieces of the puzzle until we learn the full truth.

And the truth is shocking. And watching video of this is only more disturbing.

Naturally, these fishermen have gone through the trouble of capturing these dolphins. The dolphins that aren't purchased by a ""Sea World"" like organization must be put to good use. And the use these fishermen come up with is pretty unsettling.

This is a film we should all see, to help spread the word. If we spread the word, we can put a stop to what is happening in Taijii, Japan.",1250380800,147,3257,4.650434782608696
3964976,5,B002PLMJ74,"This is an excellent documentary. The film has the tactics of a covert operations task force, the watchability of a fiction action flick, and a desire to inform the public on a tragedy that is unlawfully being ignored. A must see for anyone interested in the environment, health, and the preservation of an intelligent, phenomenal mammal.",1250121600,44,338,5.053571428571429
3964977,5,B002PLMJ74,"Eye opening and shocking. Hard to watch some parts because of the raw truth but an absolute must watch for everyone. Along the lines of Blackfish, The Cove takes you where no one's gone before to see the devastating side of animal captivity and the act of capturing these beautiful  and intelligent creatures for profit and greed. It makes you want to take action, and thankfully we all can. After watching the movie I donated my birthday to raise money for the Cove and to help protect and rehabilitate captured dolphins.",1506556800,,522,4.736263736263736
3964978,1,B002PLMJ74,Racist piece of work. Norway kills 2x more whales than Japan and Europe as a whole still kills almost 4x more whales annually than Japan does whales or dolphins. Where are those documentaries?,1505520000,,192,4.848484848484849
3964979,1,B002PLMJ74,"This move is full of lies and misrepresentations. It is a bunch of ethnocentric people that eat fat steaks, pork roasts, and plump chickens telling proud Japanese what not to eat. I looked at data (what a concept !), and all hunting done by Japan is completely sustainable, and has been for centuries.

I have started to look for Whale meat, so I can eat it as a sign of solidarity with the Japanese people.

This movie is pure rubbish.

3964984,1,B002PLMJ74,"Emotionally based documentary. It plays on the viewers emotions rather than on a reasonable argument as to *why* the conclusions stated are such. Over and over again, it is stated that because the particular trainer ""feels"" that the dolphins are ""self aware"" that they must indeed be so. ""Feelings"" are substituted over argument. The film presupposes many points that have not been proven. For instance:

1. Killing Dolphins (as opposed to other animal) is wrong.
2. Certain nations have the authority to prescribe to other nations what particular food ought be allowed to eat.
3. Dolphins are somehow different than other sea animals that are consumed.
4. The view of the film maker (Richard O'Barry) is correct.
5. That because people find Dolphins cute, they should not be eaten.
6. That even though the Earth is mainly covered in Ocean, the actions of ONE particular fishing town in Japan is affecting Dolphin populations worldwide.
7. That Dolphins are different to Humans only in ""Degree"" and not in ""Kind"".

In other nations Cows are seen as Sacred, and not killed for beef. In the West, Beef is held in high regard as a meal. Ought other nations impose their beliefs on the West? Is the West obligated to oblige by a belief system that is foreign? Why?

Of course, it could be argued that Cows are stupid, and Dolphins are intelligent. So? Do we assign an IQ test to animals we are considering as a meal? Or, it could be argued that certain animals are becoming extinct, and cows are plentiful. Keep in mind, what is being proclaimed by this documentary is that killing certain animals is morally wrong...regardless of how many exist. Over and over we are told that killing Whales and Dolphins is ""wrong"". But NEVER, is it stated in a rational manner WHY it is wrong. Emotions are appealed to, not reason. If killing an animal for food is morally correct, then at what point does it become morally wrong? When it is close to becoming extinct? This is an arbitrary distinction and cannot rationally be supported....perhaps that is why EMOTION is appealed to as reason has been left behind by the film makers.

For ANY claim regarding what OUGHT to be the proper action to have weight, it must be supported by a Moral framework as its grounding. Not ONCE, is ANY Moral framework argued for in this film.

This is a must see film. NOT because of its accuracy and reasonableness, but as an example of how to persuade the general populace by using emotion rather than argument.  Please take note: I have not ONCE, stated that I either agree or disagree with the films conclusion. I am solely stating that the film provides no appeal for its conclusions other than emotion. Human emotions are individualistic by nature. One person may ""feel"" strongly about a certain issue and another person may ""feel"" indifferent or even contrary to the first. How ought we decide whose ""emotion"" is correct? Majority?

If we choose the majority as a means by which to decide what is correct, keep in mind that there are other nations with bigger populations than the U..S. My emotions change...sometimes from one minute to the next. Ought emotions be our sole source of grounding for our decisions?

If killing Dolphins for food is wrong, then tell us WHY it is wrong. MY emotions may not agree with yours, but if we use reason then those that are REASONABLE will always agree.

Documentary? No. More like a Tear Jerker Drama.",1488153600,5,3414,4.743676222596965

Same goes for dolphins and this movie is a great awareness to the cause.

It is truly unfathomable that in this day and age, countries and special interests, are allowed to brutally kill tens of thousands of animals all in the name of money. Almost as disturbing as the dolphin kill footage, is the smug and abhorrent manner that the Japanese delegation displays during the international meetings.

3965053,5,B002PLMJ74,"This film is an eye opening adventure that should be watched by anyone with the ability to feel emotion. In my view, ""The Cove"" sheds light onto a major moral issue that too few people know about. The director, Louie Psihoyos, and his team of trained and ready men and women embark on a journey that will test their limits and put their lives on the line to give a voice to an animal, thought to be one of the smartest on the planet, that has been silenced by the country committing these atrocious acts.

  Through appalling visuals and exposed secrets, the team informs and shocks us with what is going on and just how little is being done to stop it. To the community in Taiji, this may be somewhat normal and justifiable because of the belief that dolphins are causing a shortage in the one resource that this town is known for, but the fact is, it's them. They refuse to believe that it's the people of Taiji over fishing the waters around them and the easiest way to avoid the blame is to place it on something that cannot defend itself. The visuals of slaughter and struggle are very effective in getting the audience to react and that is more important than anything. This small team may not be able to stop this from happening on their own, but they easily get us on their side by viewing this film.",1449532800,,1308,4.374485596707819

The film depicts the effort to obtain evidence that Dolphins were actually being slaughtered en mass in a small remote cove in Japan. It is awesome to see how many people from different walks of life with varying skills help to achieve this goal.
And
***SPOILER ALERT***
It is such a ""take that!"" moment when they do achieve it. Seriously, knowing they do will not diminish the impact of how it is depicted in this film.

We are still learning about the incredible intellect of Dolphins as mammals, but no one can deny that there is no evil or cruelty in them, as there is in mankind, and this movie proves just that. I can personally accept dolphins in captivity for limited entertainment and study, but not a senseless slaughter such as this. Thanks to the filmakers and producers for their countless hours, dollars, and personal risk of arrest and physical harm in the making of this film, so that we may see this abhorrent tragedy for ourselves. Difficult to watch at times, but a must see for anyone who does not already know about the practices depicted in ""The Cove.""

Watching this film makes the viewers want to support the cause and expose the corrupt systems happening in Japan with dolphin slaughterings. Money is the major factor for this business, it's not normal to want to sell toxic dolphin meat to consumers. The market they have makes it easier to gain the product cheap and in abundance.

3965112,2,B002PLMJ74,i recently watched this in class though i have seen it before then i have to say i believe this Documentary was well made but i can not say i enjoyed it the first complaint which i have is the fact that the people in this Documentary did not speak Japaneses and were in a different country were they had no businesses jugging the people there and if they are going to to the least they could do was learn the Language. One more thing is they openly lie to the police showing even more disrespect for the people of the country they were staying in. Further more they often spoke of animal abuse when in fact i see no difference between this and any other slaughter house. i give this 2 stars for its effect on people and take away 3 for disrespect,1430092800,,746,4.1875

Before I watched this movie I had no knowledge whatsoever on the mistreatment of dolphins in Japan and all around the globe. They explained that although dolphins look like they are smiling, it does not necessarily mean they are happy. I found this interesting because I went to sea world and perceived the dolphins as happy creatures when the truth is that they have no business being in captivity.

Yet the world fish supply  including  Cetaceans contain high levels of mercury which is not only poisoning the Japanese people but those who regularly consume any kind of so-called sea food as well.

NOTE: Mercury released into the environment becomes a serious threat when it settles into oceans and waterways, where it builds up in fish. Exposure to mercury may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.

If you're like me, there are movies you want to see, you know you should see, but don't get around to (for a while) because you know they're going to be sad and depressing and it's hard to get in the mood for. Often they end up being my favorites, but I'll put them off in favor of more fun entertainment.

3965135,1,B002PLMJ74,"This is one of the most racist movies made int he last decade. It's more racist than Mickey Rooney pretending to be Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's and it is way more problematic than Memoirs of a Geisha or whitewashed Ghost in the Shell. Yet it won an Academy Award because white people don't really notice racism when their rich white compatriots are crying over dolphins.

Taking a cue from the National Alliance that uses religious slaughter methods in order to hate Jews and Muslims, this movie is full of ""activists"" who have decided that the worst thing in the world is the fact that Japanese people eat dolphins. They don't care about octopi, crab, squid or tuna fish but those pretty little dolphins are so adorable that we have to stop everything to save them. I have never seen a movie where Japanese filmmakers run over to Wisconsin to harass chicken and dairy farmers, but apparently it's perfectly fine for white people to go over to Japan and harass them.

There are several scenes in this movie that require you to LOVE dolphins to the point of psychosis in order to agree with the filmmakers. When Japanese schools want to put dolphins on the menu, you are supposed to be horrified. When dolphins are being killed for food you are supposed to hate the people who are doing the killing and not the people filming them.

Even worse are the ""activists"" who are the kind of wealthy privileged white people who shop at Whole Foods and wonder why people hate them. One of the most disgusting scenes is when one of the ""activists"" waxes poetic about the experience of swimming with the dolphins. This is one of those vacations that costs thousands of dollars and this person is recommending it as if it's a mere trip to the ATM. The movie doesn't criticize this privileged position. In fact it celebrates his myopic selfishness.

There are rumors that the director is openly a racist against Japanese people. Whether or not these rumors are true, he made a disgustingly racist movie.",1424822400,,1996,4.694285714285714

And yes, while all life should be protected, humans prioritize intelligence. So people don't eat their cousins, or their dogs. It's something that most people follow as an unspoken rule. It has nothing to do with ""cuteness"". I am concerned by the comments that read ""it's their fish, they must protect them"". Their fish? As in, humans own the ocean? Laughable. Dolphins, at least, give back somewhat to the oceanic food chain... A food chain that all people, Japan being a major seafood consumer, throw out of balance via over fishing. This documentary brings many things to light. The intelligence and beauty of dolphins, human ego and cruelty, and the dangers of over fishing and greed. That being said, it can be a bit preachy. It would have been more effective with more subtlety. Form your own opinion on both the entertainment value and the message, but for goodness sake, at least recognize that human ego does not grant ownership and dominion over all of nature. The message is, I think, that we must find harmony and balance. That comes from respect for nature and life, and implementing sustainable and ethical practices.

3965169,4,B002PLMJ74,"Richard O'Barry (famous trainer of Flipper) and a number of divers and concerned citizens go undercover to film the horrible slaughter of dolphins in a remote village of Japan.  These dolphins are rapidly declining in the world population but that isn't the key reason for their actions.

Dolphins like whales are mammals.  They have a highly advanced communication system and they are capable of emotions.  The recordings that are captured during they massacre is appalling.  It is very intense.  It is bloody.

Their meat which is high in mercury is being sold in fish markets as something else in order to get rid of it.  In the 50's, high consumption of dolphin meat caused a generation of deformed children due to their exposure in utero, there is a concern this result will be repeated because of the complicity of the Japanese government.  There is a big cover-up that this video successfully reveals.

I wanted to compare it to ""Blackfish"" and while the two films focus on the cover-ups of the slaughter of dolphins or sale for profit; this shows the brutality done to the dolphins whereas ""Blackfish"" shows the dolphins reactions to captivity and profiteering done by corporations.  This film was done in 2009 and it was the first to expose the agenda's of those involved in the capture of dolphins.  As a result of the video and the efforts of this team, dolphin meat is no longer being fed to school children in at least on area of Japan, which had been going on for some time.

All in all, I do prefer ""Blackfish"" because it spotlights the long-term impact captivity has on dolphins and the dangers posed by their ""imprisonment"" additionally, living in Orlando, this was a major story when Dawn Brancheau, the SeaWorld trainer who was crushed, dismembered, and partially swallowed in 2010 took place (the area public had no idea the extent of her injuries nor that she was ingested).

A town on the coast of Japan, called Taiji, hunts dolphins from Sept to May. Herding them by banging metal pipes, into an inlet called ""The Cove"", the deadly vibrations echoing.....

  After these beautiful creatures are cornered the fishermen close off the opening with nets so they can't escape. As their families on the other side cried & watched in horror. First the selected few, i.e.the ""prettiest"" ones, are netted & later sold to the highest bidders (places like Sea World). The rest are slaughtered, the water & beach forever stained with blood of over 20,000 dolphins, porpoises, and small whales each year. You can hear & see these dolphins being killed in the most inhumane ways possible. Afterwards, the carcasses  are taken to a secret slaughterhouse & later sold to supermarkets. Dolphins, because of years of pollution, have toxic levels of Mercury.

  Most of the Japanese public is unaware of the carnage that goes on in The Cove.

As difficult as it may be to watch, or pay attention, to the end I believe that anyone who claims to be a conservationist must see this.  Not only are we overfishing our seas, or oceans, but we are not taking care of our lands and airways. We are not the only beings who are entitled to live our lives in relative contentment and freedom.  I suppose Richard OBarry believes he need to explain himself, or atone for past sins committed, but I found myself feeling a bit impatient to learn of what he discovered in the end.

If the majority of Japanese citizens do not know about their fellow citizen fishermen, they should be made aware of what is being done to feed them.  In my opinion what these fishermen are doing is horrific and I feel a bit like if there is a god I hope they are taken care of accordingly.

Japanese are so full of dirt, corrupted no less that any other country! I can see that now! Dolphins are multi-million / billion dollars industry, giving the crazy amount of money every year to those who slaughter dolphins, and those who protect those murderers for a fairly huge amount of money!

I had a NUCLEAR BLAST OF EMOTIONS!

This is a MUST WATCH documentary! Do not miss it because it may sound depressing! You must OPEN YOUR EYES TO THESE JAPANESE SCUMBAGS POISONING THIS WORLD! For the record I'll never visit a dolphinarium and look the same way at what seemed to be happy, dolphins.

3965328,5,B002PLMJ74,"""The Cove"" can only be described in one way - riveting.  It tells the story of a secret slaughter of innocent dolphins in a small town in Japan.  The trainer who worked with the original Flipper, Ric O'Barry, is now firmly against the captivity of any marine life, and the documentary shows his efforts to document the silent slaughter of thousands of dolphins each year in a small lagoon called 'the cove'.  He and his crew meet resistance on many fronts, and to their credit they persevere so the world sees the atrocity that is occurring there.

Parts of the documentary are very hard to watch - notably the sections when the slaughter occurs.  If you think of dolphins as similar to fish since they share the same environment, you will think again when you see these magnificent creatures suffer as they are killed.  Part of the film shows the extent of the slaughter with no dialogue and this is the hardest part to watch - the water in the cove changes to bright red and you have to turn away for a second.

If you have any inclination of feelings towards the majestic dolphin and other marine mammals, you will enjoy this film, if only for the fact that it shows the successful exposing of an atrocity by the Japanese.  In this day and age, it is difficult to accept that such a slaughter is cultural - so was slavery in the American past, and look how far we've come.

This one is a keeper.  Watch it and get involved in saving these beautiful creatures.",1373846400,3,1462,4.462406015037594

3965331,5,B002PLMJ74,"""A dolphin's smile is nature's greatest deception.""

- Ric O'Barry/The Cove

For O'Barry, the struggle began in 1960, when he ventured to train Kathy, the dolphin, which starred in the movie Flipper. As he states it in the award winning full-length documentary, The Cove, he spent ten years creating a multimillionaire industry and the rest of his life-time trying to dismantle what he could have never imagined would've happened: dolphin slaughters. If not killed by man, a dolphin can actually commit suicide.

This documentary was exceptional in solving my ignorance on dolphin slaughtering/baby-dolphin-pillaging. It also informed me on how organizations and governments are willing to risk for a bucket of extra-cash: both from the active and the passive parties.

So now eating sea fish or any other fish for that matter will be quite difficult in seeing that you could be basically eating almost anything: like dolphins! Cash in exchange for a country intoxicated by Mercury: it's such a tragedy  (dolphin meat is very high in mercury); and in the middle, the dolphin suffers the constant beat of the hammer.

If you are ignorant, like I was, about what dolphins endure, then you must see this documentary. Get informed and know the truth.

The mission: I truly admire what O'Barry's team did in Japan. The mission was a success and if it were not for their effort, some hundreds of dolphin and this documentary would've been impossible to set free/create.

Save a dolphin! There are many ways to become an activist in saving these amazing mammals; and that's another great reason why you should watch this very well-made movie: understand that other creatures are as smart as we humans are.",1370908800,4,1698,5.039285714285715

On top of that, almost all of the towns people outside of the fishermen, have no clue what is going on in the cove. Louie Psihoyos created the documentary in a fantastic way which talked about everything from the dolphin and whale killing to mercury poisoning. Also, the mercury contaminated meat was being served to children for their school lunches. i would give this video five stars becasue it was an awesome way to raise awareness and make an impact on the issue.

3965356,4,B002PLMJ74,"The motion picture entitled ""The Cove"" can be called many things; bold, defiant, proactive. However of all these attributes the most prominent is its informative nature. ""The Cove"" is a film that addresses the dolphin killings currently taking place in Taiji, Japan. It includes not only graphic images  that help bring to attention and illustrate the disturbing and gruesome nature of said dolphin killings, but also mentions the impact that these killings have on all relevant societies and explains why it is such a pressing social problem. Allow me to illustrate a point taken from the film that will help in the confirmation of these killings being a social problem. The film stated that dolphin meat is highly laced with mercury which happens to be the most poisonous non-radioactive chemical that has been discovered to date. Under normal circumstances this would present no relevant meaning, However due to the slaughter of the the dolphins the meat is subsequently sold to the general populace which unbeknownst to them contains high levels of toxicity. The film stated that the toxicity level of mercury for the average human is .4 PPM (parts per million), dolphin meat is said to contain 2000 PPM of mercury. The concentration of mercury in dolphin meat has caused many epidemics and illnesses to break out in Japan. Through this example it can be seen how a pre-existing problem can lead to another and the film explains this in a clear, concise and understandable way that effectively brings up its relevance. In summary ""The Cove"" had the objective of raising awareness and instigating action which it achieved. I would recommend this film to anybody, It is not only informative but it sends a powerful enough of a message to inspire people to take action and for that it deserves to be commended. Thank you for taking the time to read my discourse on this given subject.",1369008000,,1885,4.946372239747634

It tells how often they are being killed and how endangered they are. But it also tells about the dolphins themselves. They are actually not healthy to eat. You learn a lot about dolphins that you normally wouldn't. It's horrendous the amount of killings that go on and people need to be aware of it. Dophins are abused everyday. The shocking killings of these magestic animals is nauseating. The government in Japan is hiding the abuse of these animals from the world for selfish and greedy things. Money is the only thing on his governments mind. Morals are nonexistent.

It started off a little weird with you trying to figure out who the narrator was and why is he one of the subjects.  After that settles and you see who's who, this film just takes off.  I felt a little stupid thinking I was aware of most of the issues concerning animals in captivity and their journey from the wild to the cages but this film taught me a great deal more.

Don't want to put spoilers in my review but this film was good.  That whole Black Ops Japan stunt they pulled was phenomenal. I'm glad they put some behind-the-scenes footage to show us to what lengths they went to make it all happen.

A film you can watch with the whole family.  Public high schools should be showing films like these instead of boring us with 1950's public service announcement classroom videos.

Great film (by ""great"" I mean ten times better than Searching for Sugarman).",1366502400,5,1033,4.452127659574468
3965390,5,B002PLMJ74,"I gave this documentary five stars because I felt it was a issue that everyone should watch and be aware of. As described, this film is about a place in Japan called ""The Cove"" where thousand of dolphins are caught every year for use in dolphin shows and for food. A group of activisits, headed by the trainer of the ""Flipper"" dolphins back in the 60's., go to this cove and plant surveillance cameras in this heavily guarded area so the world can see this horrific spectacle of blood shed. It is a very brutal scene as the fisherman catch these dolphins using barbaric methods of slaughter.

I felt this documentary shows what a small group of individuals can accomplish when they put their minds and their hearts together. I was aware of this massacre of dolphins before I watched this film but I wasn't aware of how truly inhumane it really was. The scenes of the footage are almost impossible to watch they are so cruel. The film also brings up the facts about how much mercury these dolphins have in their meat which the Japanese government was allowing to be given to children in poorer areas to eat for their school lunches.

I think it is so important these days to keep informed about the atrocities that are occurring all over the world with people and animals. Dolphins are highly intelligent, some would say super-intelligent mammals, maybe even smarter than humans. To see them slaughtered and captured for human consumption and amusement is something everyone should see before they go to their next dolphin show.

here these activists have taken a unique stance to be the, 'mission-impossible' agents of protection and change
alerting us all of the tragedy occurring every 6 months to the dolphin and small whales traveling their migratory path during their breeding seasons and with their new young - who are mercilessly slaughtered for no-good-reason as usual with the humans vs life on this planet - to the tune of 30 thousand a season dead - is to rouse us to unanimously condemn such inhumanity  -  all the beings that travel this route will become extinct as has happened in a neighboring cove in japan that did in fact create the extinction of all the species of cetaceans that migrated upon it's path of slaughter years earlier

the film educates us that at the current rate of fishing (mainly by Asia) and exploitation the earth's oceans will be completely 'fished-out' within 40 years  - do you realise the impact of this is something we must work to correct immediately

this will lead to a devastation of our main oceanic Eco-systems, barely understood by science, weather systems,  and could conceivably crash our bio-sphere as we wipe-out  the oceanic life in the great chain of biodiversity in our oceanic Eco-system

i am not an alarmist, but as a smart person the effects of such a global disaster in real time is worse than any Hollywood disaster film could ever construe

a wonderful film which had everyone is our house-hold including the intellectual rationalists moving and acting to do something about this senseless slaughter and taking actions to insuring protections of our earth's oceanic life

lucky for us there are many groups dedicated and in place to make international pleas for such protections and changes in how the international communities interact with our earth's oceans and oceanic life - but your voice is needed - it is still all too old-fashioned and not yet working to effect a quick and timely change

3965431,4,B002PLMJ74,"""The Cove"" (2009 release; 90 min.) is a documentary that focuses on the unsavory (and that's being mild) practices going on in the Japanese village of Taiji. As the movie opens, we meet Ric O'Barry, whom we learn became a dolphin training expert on the ""Flipper"" 1960s TV series. It shows some clips from that era, and then O'Barry explains why he became an activitst to stop dolphin captivity (he claims that one of the dolphins portraying Flipper, died in his arms, deeply depressed and committing suicide by stopping to breathe). O'Barry teams up with the Ocean Preservation Society (the director of this documentary is part of OPS) to expose the Taiji massacres of dolphins. At that point, the documentary becomes a cat-and-mouse spy thriller of sorts, showing how they try and evade local Japanese authorities in their quest to expose what is going on. I say 'thriller' but not in the sense of exciting-thriller, as what is happening is infinately sad. The last 20 min. of the movie, when all is revealed, are shocking and sickening.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is NOT a film for young children, despite its PG-13 rating. Second, kudos to the filmmakers for exposing this brutality to the world. Third, since the movie was released in 2009 (and winning the 2010 Oscar for Best Documentary), this had obviously created a lot of controversy and debate, but apparently the Taiji massacres sadly have not been stopped and continue to this day.

There are a number of interesting ""bonus"" materials on the DVD, the best of them being a 20 min. mini-documentary called ""The Cove: Mercury Rising"", on the issue of the dangerous levels of mercury found in not just dolphins, but many other sea fish, and the devastating effects of mercury poisosing on humans. It appears the Japanese have not learnt their lesson from the 1950s Minamata incident (the movie shows some historical footage from that, and it will make your stomach sick). In all, this is quite the DVD. All that aside, ""The Cove"" is a MUST-SEE documentary on so many levels.",1353456000,2,2049,4.868194842406877

Indeed, not only is this parasite possessed of a strong will to kill but he's also possessed with extreme stupidity, for this species is alone on the planet in blindly committing mass suicide. How? By supporting factory farming which does a great job of using up valuable resources while contributing methane gas that accelerates global warming(scientifically proven by U.N. scientists and others)and our demise.

3965451,4,B002PLMJ74,"Excellent documentary that brought to light a then-little-known issue. Credit to Ric O'Barry and the filmakers for their courage and tenacity despite incredible resistance. As the film states, they just touched the tip of the iceberg and we must look to grass roots movements to affect any positive change. Governments and large organizations are not only ineffective, oftentimes they are part of the problem - with coverups and allowing harmful and brutal practices to continue. Aside from the horrendous dolphin slaughter, this film also points to an even larger problem that affects many of us and our childen: mercury toxicity.  There are toxic levels of mercury in some of the most popular the fish we eat - tuna, halibut, sea bass. This issue of mercury toxicity was well-covered in the Special Features section under Mercury Rising.  RFK, Jr - an environmental attorney who focuses on water pollutants and is founder of Water Alliance - addresses the issue, its link to thimerosol in vaccines and the increase in childhood diseases since 1989 and makes some  compelling points.

The various types of cameras used in the film added to its impact.  Thermal cameras gave it a more ""covert ops"" feel. The aerial shots showing a demarcation line between the bloody red water in the cove and the otherwise blue water was powerful in showing the immensity of this brutal slaughter.

The film suggests that we all have a part as cause of both predicaments.  Our public demand spurs both problems.  Sea World, and similar aquarium parks with shows highlighting performing dolphins and Orcas, is a multi-billion industry and a primary reason for these creatures to be hunted and captured/slaughtered.  Our coal burning plants spew tons of mercury-containing pollutants into the air which then fall to the waterways and oceans contaminating the sealife, and eventually ourselves.  As we continue with our Homo-centric value system, callous to making other species extinct, are we gradually killing ourselves off?

As a prologue, the year after this DVD's release, the worldwide attention resulted in a delay to the start of the Cove killing season and even the release of captured dolphins who were not sold into captivity.  Unfortunately, as the attention died down, the killing resumed.  In January 2011, Sea Shepherd Conservation reported about 540 dolphins had been killed during the season, and another 140 were captured.",1332633600,,2422,5.17948717948718

On a side note, my wife brought up a good point. Why don't we protest the animals that are being abused and killed all for the sake of a quick meal too?: chickens and cows being mass produced and manufactured, restrictive, stressful, growth sped-up lives to feed our need for fast food while this poison results in a marked increase over the last 30 years in tumors and cancer; food of NO nutritional value whatsoever (hormones and antibiotics mostly, and stress). Back to the topic; yes, we all need to get involved. That's the key. Watch The Cove, but 90% of what's needed is action. Please do your part. We have. Peace!

3965453,5,B002PLMJ74,"After watching this, I can't help but love and even admire dolphins. I later found out that dolphins possess many more amazing features except the merits mentioned in the movie.

1,Dolphins value their friends very much. They even treasure their friends' dead body! They don't allow other animals to eat their friend who died. So dozens or even hundreds of them will cluster around the dead one for more than ten days till its body gets rotten!

2,Dolphins will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism is limited to their own species. That expalins why they would rescue human lifes, just out of instinct!

3,They have great maternal love. If a dolphind kid dies, the dolphin mother will try her very best to bring her dead child back to life, which could probably cost their own life. Therefore, workers of aquarium have to make great efforts to fish up it, though it is very hard as the dolphin mother will fight tooth and nail to against it.

4, Each dolphin in a herd has his or her own name, so they can distinguish their friends not just by the voice but by a complex combination of sound.

5CAlthough dolphins are pugnacious, they also like to reconciliate. A study conducted in an American zoo has shonw that after a fight, they would rub each other lightly or one would drag another one to swim across the swiming pool.

6,Most dolphins have acute eyesight, both in and out of the water, and they can hear frequencies ten times or more above the upper limit of adult human hearing.

3965460,5,B002PLMJ74,"Irrespective of your politics, animal preferences, religion, country/race bias, etc, the fact is that the slaughtering of dolphins in Japan is criminal insanity at its worst.

The cause to stop the slaughter is no more or less worthy than any others that address man's inhumanity to man (and beast). As the old saying goes, (whichever version you prefer), ""All that is required for the triumph of evil, is for good men to say nothing."" These film-makers are saying something, at risk to themselves, so kudos and congratulations to them. Thank goodness someone is prepared to speak out.

Many of the Japanese population have no idea what is happening in their own country. Even if the killing of the dolphins was as humane as possible (an oxymoron surely), it remains pointless as these poor animals are tainted by man-made pollution and their meat not fit for consumption.  The Japanese behind the slaughter are so devoid of values/ethics, that they are prepared to poison schoolchildren (via the provision of dolphin meat in compulsory school lunches) and their fellow countrymen and women in pursuit of the almighty Yen.  Even when considered from an entirely pragmatic viewpoint, the slaughter is insane.

Whether you love dolphins (as I do) or not, is beside the point ... this practice is outrageous and shameful.  It MUST stop.",1319760000,,1333,5.036363636363636
3965461,5,B002PLMJ74,"I rated this film 5-stars for the time it took to profile the always-beautiful Dolphin. We get to see Dolphins in their natural environment as individuals, as members of large social groups and as family members.

Most tragically, we also get to see the kill-happy Japanese repeatedly stabbing these precious animals with daggers attached to poles. They trap hundreds upon hundreds of Dolphins in a tiny bay they cannot swim out of, and from their little boats go on to carry out a mass slaughter like few people have ever witnessed. Incredibly, up to the time this film was released, even the Japanese people had no idea this was happening right under their noses!!! Like most animal slaughter aparatus, this has been kept very hush hush for a long time. Regrettably, even after learning of what's happening to these creatures, the Japanese government has done nothing to stop it. So much of the meat ""harvested"" in these mass slaughters goes to waste because of how high the level of Mercury is in Dolphin meat.

Leave it to people in the far east to destroy every living creature imaginable if only they can get a shiny U.S. nickel for it. These people have zero regard for how endangered any species may be. Very simply, if the animal can fetch one shiny nickel, it's worth destroying (in their sick, demented rationale). No matter what it may be, how beautiful, how rare, how protected the species may be, i.e. Whales, Dolphins, Tuna, Tigers, Dogs, Cats, etc., etc., etc., to infinity!

3965462,4,B002PLMJ74,"Every sailor and fisherman knows of stories where many of their brethren have owed their survival at sea to the protection and help from dolphins and porpoises. How can modern Japan turn its gaze in the opposite direction while these same creatures are savagely slaughtered en masse by so-called fishermen? A nation that bows so low to industry and masquerades such brutality with 'national pride' is in desperate want of deep soul-searching. And I will touch the third rail and say what professional film critics can't: the behaviour and attitude of the Taiji fishermen, in conjunction with the Japanese government's acceptance of their savagery for the sake of industry, is an exposure of the underbelly of the same Japanese cultural arrogance that resulted in the horrors of the Bataan Death March, the barbarity of Unit 731 in Northern China, and other historical acts of inhumane monstrosity. Shame on the people of Taiji and shame on the government of Japan. It doesn't take that much scratching of the surface to see the ugliness that still dwells beneath. (And it is poetic justice and perhaps Karmic payback that the gem of Japanese industry, Toyota, became embroiled in a multi-escalating scandal (2010) resulting from dangerous and deadly engineering defects.) A thousand accolades would still not be enough recognition of the bravery and the determination of the filmmakers -- in front and behind the camera -- to bring evidence of this annual slaughter to the public.",1319068800,2,1480,5.119834710743802

3965464,5,B002PLMJ74,I recommend this movie to everybody. It is a great movie and exposes Japan for what they are doing to innocent dolphins. A must see.,1312156800,,132,4.32
3965465,4,B002PLMJ74,"Look, I'm not an enviroweenie so this is not a review that will gush over how important it is that we save the cute animals of the world. So, given that my POV is not one of the converted, I will say this film mostly hits all the right notes.

I was expecting ranting, raving and railing against the poor dolphins being slaughtered but it's the exact opposite. It's a very well-done flick. In fact it runs more like an espionage novel than anything else. The actual slaughter of the dolphins only shows up onscreen in the last 15 minutes. It's the buildup that makes this one of the best documentaries of the year.

Even so I felt they left out a lot. When they devise these fantastic hidden cameras disguised as rocks, I wanted to know how they got them through Customs in Japan. I also wondered why these Westerners had this military style operation to film the dolphin slaughter yet we never see any Japanese helping them. Surely, they needed translators at times. Even if locals we're reluctant to get involved for fear of persecution at home, you'd think some Japanese Americans would be involved. There are definitely Japanese listed in the credits and, even if they could not show them onscreen, I'd like to have at least have them acknowledged during the film.

Then the police know they are in the village of Taiji (the dolphin murder capital of the world) and yet they never seem to knock on their hotel room doors. One step into their room, and they'd find all this equipment. Having lived in Japan where police have far greater powers than in the West, you'd figure they'd get a visit. As it was the police basically just tailed them and really other than some innocuous questions in the hotel lobby, do nothing at all.

Worse though are the dopey surfers who do this ""pray for the dolphins"" circle in the water that seems the typical lefty thing to do where those with their hearts in the right place can feel good about themselves but it accomplishes zip. This is why the guerrilla filmmakers really accomplish a lot. They realize the way to accomplish the same goal is to expose the whole insane process via this documentary.

Having said all that, the film is sold by the measured tones of the main protagonist, Richard O'Barry, the original trainer of Flipper the famous dolphin from the TV series that ran in the '60s, who changed his tune to that of a man who regrets ever capturing dolphins and putting them into captivity.

The strange thing is we found the ""Mercury Rising"" extra a far scarier tale. In that there is an examination of the levels of mercury in the seafood we eat. the scariest line in that short is the scientists who test mercury levels for the Japanese government do not eat sushi or sashimi at all. You have to watch this special feature and I guarantee you'll have second thoughts about eating tuna. I'm torn as my 103-year-old grandma-in-law has eaten sushi or sashimi every day of her life . . . and who doesn't love negitoro?

Anyway, the movie and the extras are food for thought in more ways than one and do expose the typical Japanese way of justifying things (don't even get me started on the high price of rice in Japan and the politics behind that).

Just take some of the stuff in here with a grain of salt. Yes, the dolphin hunt is cruel and stupid, but this claim throughout the movie about the intelligence of dolphins seems misguided. If they are such smart evolved animals especially their so-called sonar skills, why can't they differentiate between a bunch of fisherman banging on long sticks and the danger that lies ahead of them? I just felt that was thrown in there to make us feel sympathy rather than to sell us on why killing dolphins is wrong. I think it's enough to say--dolphin meat is so loaded with mercury that why eat poison. That's enough for me to avoid dolphin not because they are so cute and supposedly ""intelligent.""",1311984000,4,3895,4.562231759656652

I've wanted to see this film for a long time after hearing so much about it. I watched it practically right away. All I can say is it left me heartbroken for these animals of which I have grown to love-even before this film was made. I am very saddened to know this truth. I will never attend any marine park which puts these loving, peaceful animals into the no-choice position of our entertainment or pleasure for money. The money that comes out of our own pockets. This is a mental torture for these animals. Dolphins in general are very sensitive to sound-especially loud noise. You can imagine what they go through in thise shows. Thousands of people screaming in a stadium is unthinkable for them. Many of them die shortly after being held captive in these tanks due to the noise-they are suffering. The have been ripped away from not only their ocean environment but also their own families and pods. The animals become depressed, they may stop eating and as Rick O Barry explains in the film how the actor Dolphin named, ""Cathy"" committed a suicide in his arms. He tells us that dolphins are unlike humans in this way that us humans automatically breath for air. But dolphins and whales literally have to make a concious effort to breath.

In this film it is also explained how overfishing is effecting this entire planet. Most of our fish comes from Japan. The Japanese are fishing too much, and estimated in 40 years we may see a collapse in the fishery departments. Not just overfishing, but almost every fish in this world right now, salt water or fresh water, contains high toxins of murcury. This murcury is extremely high in Dolphin and Whale. In Taiji, Japan they are killing 23,000 dolphins per year (whales included)from September until March. This is what I call, Red Season. Killing them for food. I call it ""Red Season"" because of the color of the bay due to all the killings.

I think Rick O Barry is doing a great job at what he beleives in-and what I believe in. He is making up for his past and I praise and respect him for that. I honor him and those who help him.

If you have a heart, You really should see this film. You'll be glad you did. You will never go to ""SeaWorld"" again, you may think twice about eating Sushi or your Tuna/Swordfish steak, and will see the world quite differently.

It is one of those movies that everyone has to watch, it isn't an easy documentary to watch, that's for sure.  It's not lighthearted, and it is a tear jerker, even so, I do believe that everyone should watch this.  Why?  Because the issue that it is discussing is so horrendous and something needs to be done know, and really, what can be done if we don't have people to help?

Thousands upon thousands of dolphins are being killed every September in Taji Japan.  The meat from the dolphins, before the movie was produced, was often sold in markets that announced they were an entirely different type of meat than dolphin.  The meat was also beginning to be in school cafeterias.  Now, you might be thinking ""that's not so bad...is it?  We eat cows right?""  It is bad.  It is bad because dolphin meat contains inhumane amounts of mercury, and eating a large amount of dolphin meat is terrible for your health and cause a lot of health problems.

In the obscenely horror-filled world in which we live, be careful that you don't allow this subject to become just another ""Outrage of the Week"".

He may or may not be principally responsible for the upsurge in dolphin slaughters (an offshoot of the lucrative commercial demand for performance-quality dolphins for marine parks) but his conscience believes he just might be, and the lengths he goes to to try to put the genie back in the bottle can only be described as heroic, though he may refute that.

Upsetting bit of trivia:  Dolphins in captivity are sometimes fed Maalox to treat their ulcers, the ulcers they get from being in captivity and having to deal with the cacophony of sounds that are so naturally disturbing to them.

3965485,5,B002PLMJ74,"Yes I am another Japanese here and I'd like to make some points here. Eating dolphins is not our tradition at all. It is very disturbing to me to find them  always use the word of ""tradition"" to justify dolphin harvesting, but the fact is this kind of massive commercial dolphin hunting started only in late 50's. They claim dolphin harvesting has 400 year history there, but everybody knows that  was not that big business as it is today until some decades ago. And the majority of us have never eaten dolphin meat. Many of us even did not know people in certain regions kill dolphins for meat until this movie became a hot topic. In fact, in Shizuoka, one town alone harvested nearly 10,000 dolphins every year since '60s until recent years. A result is they now can't continue harvesting  anymore in such large numbers, since the population of the species they hunted was decimated. How many of us know that? Plus, thousands of dolphins were killed in years just because they competed with fishermen. Think twice. Think the way we drove many animals to near extinction. Many opponents to the movie claim the movie does not depict what is really happening. I watched news, read articles and comments left on internet forums about this. They all say the movie was edited too much emphasizing cruelty. I saw many of them trying to make an impression that the movie was totally fake because of the edits. But which edits they were talking about? To me, there is nothing wrong with editing films to make efficient presentation. As far as I saw, I did not see anything that intentionally tweaks the fact. Overall, I believe this movie was good in that the move shed light on many things we all should have known earlier and made (hopefully many of) us think the importance of not only dolphins but also all wild life and also the urgency of better nature education to the next generation.",1286409600,13,1885,4.637724550898204

3965491,5,B002PLMJ74,"I'm not really that into documentaries.  They have a tendency to bore me and generally pertain to subjects I'm not passionate about or really have no interest in whatsoever.  I enjoy the hilarity that comes from a good BBC documentary, but that's mostly because they are so bizarre and thus extremely entertaining.  That said; when `The Cove' was released I was intrigued.  The way it was promoted, and the onslaught of accolades and praise it received, got me excited.  I really wanted to see this movie.  I finally did this past weekend, and I must say that it was beyond words.  The impact that this film has is extraordinary, and it moved me in ways I didn't expect.

Just be prepared.

For a documentary, `The Cove' really plays out like a harshly realistic espionage thriller complete with heart tugging moments of brutality that will make even the manliest of men cry (I'm a softy, so waterworks were indeed in play).  The film follows a small group of activists, lead by former dolphin trainer Richard O'Barry, as they attempt to expose a terrible ritual being practiced in the town of Taiji.  In a small and somewhat secluded cove, large amounts of bottlenose dolphins are being slaughtered for ungainly purposes and in disgustingly brutal manors.  Secluded from the minds of many locals, this practice isn't acknowledged by those outside of the know, and so O'Barry is determined to bring this to the forefront, where it belongs, so that the world as a whole can make a conscious decision as to how to stop this atrocity from taking place.

I'm just warning you, the footage that is uncovered at the films conclusion is enough to make you want to vomit.

Life is fragile, and `The Cove' makes you very aware of that reality.  Knowledge is power, and `The Cove' hopes to make that fact aware to the public as well.  What we don't know will secretly destroy us (the fact that these fisherman are selling these slaughtered dolphin meat off, disguised as whale meat, is extremely harmful when you consider the toxic levels of mercury found in the meat itself) and so O'Barry and his team work hard to make us very aware of what we are dealing with.  Regardless of the effect these atrocities have on humankind, the fact still remains that these are Gods creatures, and they deserve far more respect than they are given by the greedy governmental authorities who would rather selfishly gain from their death than learn from their existence.

If you don't know, now you will.  It is films like this that can make a difference.  I am one who is hoping that it really will!",1284336000,2,2575,4.692650334075724

This documentary tells the story of the man who helped popularize dolphins in mainstream culture--Richard O'Barry, who trained the animals in the ""Flipper"" TV series. After learning of how dolphins were being ruthlessly slaughtered around the world (especially in Japan, where most of the film takes place), he became an activist. As this film documents, a political, economic, and international conspiracy condones and promotes this awful practice, which has dire consequences for oceanic ecosystems and Japanese public health.

As a Japanese, I can not rate this movie as 5 stars.
This movie is a kind of propaganda like the movie ""Bowling for Columbine"".
Selling dolphin meat as whale is wrong.
And covering mercury poisoning up is wrong if it is true.
But please think about killing cows, pigs, chickens for meat.
I think killing animals for meat could be cruel if killing dolphins is cruel.
and they didn't mention the history of dolphin and whale hunting in Japan.
In 19th century, Western whale hunter used to kill whales to get its oil just for fuel for the lamp, they threw whale meats and bones into sea while Japanese hunted them for food.
The dolphine is not a endangered species like the bird Toki which is in the verge of its extinction. Dolphines are braking the Ikesu where fishes are feeded by fishermen, they eat fishes fishermen feed to sell for their living.
And the dolphin population in the world's oceans continue to increase every year.
More dolphins, less fishes in Ikesu.
I think fishermen of Taiji,Japan have the right to protect their property.
If you were fishermen of Taiji, would you let dolphins eat your fishes as many as they want?
And, as described in the movie, how can dolphines commit suicide?
Is it a kind of joke?

If you watch this movie, please think of what I said.
And I think forcing Japanese to stop slaughtering dolphines is like forcing American people to stop owing guns.
As American people needs guns for protection, fishermen of Taiji must hunt dolphins to protect their property.",1281916800,27,1543,4.610909090909091

3965501,5,B002PLMJ74,"A friend highly recommended ""The Cove"" to me many months ago, and I knew it would be good because I trust my friend's judgement, but...do I really want to distract myself from my already too stressed and depressing life with a documentary about the mass murder of baby dolphins?

""The Cove"" is a brilliant documentary:  a compelling character and story, stunning visuals, and expert direction.  Ric O'Barry rose to fame and fortune as Flipper's trainer, and the day after Flipper ""committed suicide"" (dolphins can choose whether to breathe, and one day Flipper decided not to) in his arms Ric O'Barry was arrested for trying to free dolphins from captivity.  Ever since then Ric O'Barry has launched a one-man crusade to free all dolphins, and his particular Moby Dick is Taiji, Japan a sleepy fishing village which specializes in capturing and killing dolphins.

The documentary has an overt political purpose -- to garner world support to stop the killing of dolphins in Japan.  It makes a convincing point that Japan itself is not benefiting from the killing of dolphins.  Because it's really the only nation that refuses to heed by the whaling ban it's become a political pariah of sorts (although judging by the silly speeches and antics of Japan's representative, it's more like a political jester).  And there are the economic consequences:  Japan spends millions every year bribing Caribbean countries more known as tax havens into supporting Japan.  Morever, Japan subsidizes the whaling trade.  And what do Japanese consumers get in return?  Mercury -- lots and lots of mercury.  Ric O'Barry even once told the fishermen of Taiji that he would pay them not to kill dolphins, and the fishermen replied that killing dolphins was about pest control (the Japanese government had apparently brainwashed them into believing that dolphins were a plight on Japan's fishing stock).  So why is Japan so recalcitrant in defending its whaling tradition?  Nationalism, says the film -- the Japanese just don't want to be told what to do by the world.  That also explains why the Taiji fishermen are so violent and rude against foreigners -- Japanese are supposed to welcome guests, but not rude and overbearing guests.

So how would the Taiji fishermen, who use dinky fishing vessels, feel upon seeing an armada of wealthy Western do-gooders armed with military-grade surveillance technology descend upon them?  The cove is a dark and beautiful place where Japanese fishermen harpoon dolphins until it turns from a serene blue into a cold red, and Ric O'Barry's crack team (there are two free-divers, a one-man stunt team, a one-man rock show logistics support system, and unknown number of cameraman, translators, and production assistants) manages to capture it all on tape.  But really was this a fair match-up?  Ignorant fishermen versus defenseless dolphins isn't really a fair match, but neither is ignorant fishermen versus Hollywood producers who with an unlimited budget procure underwater cameras, cameras with microwave technology, a blimp, and HD cameras camouflaged as rocks.

The problem with ""The Cove"" is that it's really preaching to the choir (I mean, who honestly outside Taiji, Japan believes that capturing migrating dolphins and killing them en mass is a good thing?), and its heavy handedness only serves to further alienate and anger the only constituency that matters in this film -- the Taiji fishermen.

But the startling visuals of ""The Cove"" alone make the film worth seeing.",1280448000,3,3501,5.148409893992933
3965502,2,B002PLMJ74,"My title says it all. Theres nothing in this DVD but activists trying to free dolphins and spread propaganda (SAVE FLIPPER). Showing dolphins getting slaughtered is just to shock the audience and its probably what got them the win at the Oscars. Others have stated this as well but we slaughter all sorts of animals for food and its not a pretty sight. Thats why they come in prepared packages all sliced up with out the head, guts and blood. Peoples emotional attachment is whats make one animal fine to eat while another a horrific thought. There are plenty of """"pet"""" animals that are eaten all over the world like horses (4 million a year) dogs (3 million a year) cats (2 million a year) rabbits (millions) birds ... etc. There probably isn't an animal on this earth that hasn't been consumed in big or small quantities. I just hope all the 5 star reviewers are vegetarians because it pretty ridiculous to root for this film and then chow down a 1/4 lb burger. Im all for rooting for ones cause but please don't be a hypocrite. The film jump the shark when Richard stated that the dolphin commited suicide in his arms....ROFL....im sorry I couldn't help it. Again its ones attachment that makes them think their animal is special. Another thing that bothered me about these documentaries is that their all white and their all wealthy individuals.

3965505,5,B002PLMJ74,"Other reviewers here have described this film so well that I just want to add the thought that even folks who don't usually take in documentaries may find this one compulsively watchable.

That's because ""The Cove"" isn't merely an expose about the tragic and entirely unnecessary slaughter of dolphins in Japan, but it's also a Mission-Impossible-style thriller in which a team of experts employ state-of-the-art technology and cloak-and-dagger bravado to capture on film the truth of what the fishing industry and local government in a Japanese town are trying so hard to conceal.

That truth is very hard to take -- you have never seen an entire ocean inlet saturated as red with blood as this secluded cove after each killing session.

The saddest fact of all is that there seems to be no reason why the Japanese continue to slaughter these magnificent creatures.  The fishermen are offered the same amount of money they now make to STOP their killing, and yet they persist, even knowing that dolphin meat is loaded with poisonous mercury that makes it unfit for human consumption.

Even the good guys in the film are shown to do injustice to the dolphins, like the scientists who employ hand signals to communicate with the species, knowing full-well that the finned creatures can't communicate in kind.

The DVD also contains some excellent extras, including one featurette on the ingenious cameras the team developed to reveal the secrets of the cove and another on the increasing prevalence of mercury in seafood and the environment.

In short, ""The Cove"" is a thrilling and compassionate work that should be seen by all, in the hope that the resulting outcry will at last shame the Japanese into finding better means of employment.",1278720000,2,1739,4.975862068965517

They clearly know dolphin meat is high in mercury, which is pretty poisonous to human, and sell it as whale meat (though dolphin is part of whales family).

This outstanding tale of an attempt to expose needless animal cruelty not only convincingly gained the support of environmentalists, but also the academy voters in winning the Best Documentary Oscar. Importantly it gained the support of the Japanese government in shutting down the slaughter of thousands of dolphins.

We can control the food manufacturing process, and as Food Inc dramatically demonstrates, we need to do more of that. Japan (and others around the world) can control the dumping of toxic wastes into their waters. This is a major cause of crippling illness to countless numbers of school children who are fed the dolphin meat through government controlled lunch programs. It's one thing to feed our children unnutritous food, its another to feed them ""poison"".

3965530,5,B002PLMJ74,"For those who have not seen THE COVE, allow me to give a brief synopsis:

A large, dark, cylindrical object arrives in outer space near Earth emitting a strange, groaning like sound which wreaks havoc on Earth's cities. Power outages ensue, as well as rising sea levels. Meanwhile, back on Vulcan... Kirk, Spock, Scotty and the gang are licking their wounds after destroying the USS Enterprise and narrowly escaping in a stolen bird of prey warship. They intercept the signal being emitted from the strange object hovering menacingly over a terrified Earth, and miraculously discover that the sound is that of whales! Of course, said whales have been extinct from Earth's oceans for hundreds of years due to the thoughtless actions of a small fishing village in Japan. The crew of the (former) USS Enterprise embark on a dangerous mission in their ""borrowed"" spaceship, in which they ""slingshot"" themselves around the sun - without, mind you, winding up looking like George Hamilton in the process - and find themselves back on Earth circa 1987. They arrive just in time to rescue two whales from a San Francisco aquarium before they are dumped into the lagoon of said Japanese fishing village and thumped into a bloody pulp. Hilarity ensues as the intrepid crew meanders around town seeking enough fuel for the return trip. Spock wears a robe. Curses a few times. Raises his eyebrow here and there. Kirk falls in love. Eats pizza. Woes girl. Finds whales. Rescues them. Steals girl and brings her back to the future where Marty McFly is waiting for him to arrive. ""Great Scott!"" The whales are saved! All is well!! Then Hayden Panties-In-An-Uproar shows up and starts shouting: ""SAVE THE CHEERLEADER, SAVE THE DOLPHINS, SAVE THE WORLD!""

3965532,2,B002PLMJ74,"The trailer and introductory portion of this film grabbed me emotionally. However, the dramatization and lack of alternate viewpoints lost me as the film continued. My thoughts are:

Are 23,000 dolphins slaughtered per year significant in comparison to other animal slaughter? Per USDA statistics, US commercial cattle slaughter was 34,400,000 head in 2008. Additionally, cows are significantly larger than dolphins and consume more resources in their production (feed, water, land).

Is Taiji or Japan really trying to cover this up? Although presented as a ""secret mission"", I was not convinced that access was difficult, and the local ""guards"" did not appear intimidating. The questioning by ""authorities"" appeared mildly stressful, and the large focus on the ""No Photos"" signage contrasted with reality since the crew obtained tremendous video footage of these signs.

Mercury is an issue in many areas, including the treasured SF Bay I live near. Might we (US citizens) be hypocritical on this dolphin mercury issue since we cannot eat the fish from some of our own waters?

Japan has 4% of the landmass of the US, has 10 times the population density, and is surrounded by water: doesn't it seem reasonable they should eat seafood instead of the poultry, pigs, sheep, and cattle we consume in the US?

Might shark fin production be a better animal rights target since it appears much more wasteful than the fairly complete dolphin consumption depicted in the film?

In summary, I believe the purpose of this film was to raise awareness based on sincere personal feelings for another mammal, but I was left doubtful of the severity of the issue in comparison to other current issues, like we all need to consume less.",1269475200,32,1721,5.106761565836299

3965534,4,B002PLMJ74,"I delayed seeing this film because when I first heard about it I was sure it was the latest left-wing claptrap documentary. The left-wing documentary has become its own sub-genre of the larger more general pool of documentary films. At the forefront of this genre is Micheal Moore, who makes very entertaining films (I have seen and enjoyed them all) but nevertheless extremely staged, misleading, and one-sided films. Unfortunately, many left-wing documentaries have followed this formula. They have done so partly in the pursuit of guaranteed profits, and partly out of journalistic laziness. These profits have come, but they have come at the price of credibility. So, unfortunately every time a left-wing documentary comes out I reflexively keep it at arm's length--and unfortunately I did so with this film as well. As it turns out, this film is one of the exceptions. This is a powerful and moving film; a solid 8/10.

Since watching the film, I have read a lot of online discussion about it. The film has been positively received for the most part, but one of the chief criticisms--and one I saw repeatedly in negative reviews--is that it is ""one-sided."" I could not disagree more with that assessment. The filmmakers asked for and sought out the dolphin killers (and dolphin killer's apologists) side of the story, and the few times they did get it--mostly indirectly--they were given lies, propaganda, and legalistic mumbo-jumbo. The filmmakers even go so far at times to present the other side's arguments for them in absentia and then explain why they disagree with them in a rational and well-thought out way.

The people involved in the killing and the killing industry seem to know deep down that they are wrong as evidenced by their massive clandestine and conspiratorial operation. The defense that they are doing so only because if the truth gets out it will be ""misunderstood"" rings hollow. If they genuine believed they were doing nothing wrong then they would not go to such great pains to hide it. Would a soy farmer hide his fields if someone told him it was morally wrong to farm soy, and he knew it was morally acceptable? No he would not. The complex and clandestine conspiracy to carry out the killings proves that even the killing industry knows they are in the wrong, they just choose not to stop for economic and pride-based reasons.

If there was any weakness to the film I would say that Ric O'Barry comes immediately to mind. Unfortunately he does live up to the stereotype of the left-wing activist ""true believer."" I don't doubt that his concerns are genuine--and after watching the film I share them--but he does seem to exist somewhere outside of reality. There are a lot of things that I admire about him but in other ways he seems to be too ""out there."" Overall, however, I found the film to be very captivating, well-edited, objective and moving. The film makes a powerful case for the value of dolphin lives and the film makes a powerful case that the antagonists are on the wrong side of the ethical argument. This is a very disturbing film so PLEASE don't even think about watching this with your (young) children and think carefully before watching it yourself! Some of the images and scenes in the film are etched onto my retinas and into my brain. So far this film has not resulted in the end of the dolphin killing but hopefully the more people who see this film the closer we will get to successfully pressuring Japan to stop this unnecessary behavior.",1269216000,5,3499,4.808970099667774

3965536,5,B002PLMJ74,"""The Cove"" won the Oscar for documentaries this year as well as 24 other awards. It was directed by Louie Psihoyos and written by Mark Monroe. I just finished watching this movie....and bawling my eyes out. Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard by now about the documentary revealing the senseless murder of dolphins in Taiji, Japan. I highly recommend watching this and spreading the word to others you know, but maybe not showing it to children until you feel they are old enough to handle it because it is so heart breaking.

I am a girl, so in accordance with a stereotype of my gender, I do love dolphins. I love most animals, but dolphins are special because one of my fondest childhood memories was visiting a Marine Land show where I was a lucky child picked from the audience to ""shake hands"" with (touch briefly) a dolphin and afterward the happy little dolphin fetched me an little inflatable dolphin to take home as a prize. I cried the day it finally got a hole in it and wouldn't inflate anymore.

Bias aside, I tried to watch this documentary with an open mind to judge its information and presentation on merit alone. One of the main interviewees is Ric O'Barry, a renowned trainer for dolphins on the TV Show ""Flipper"" in the 1960s. ""Flipper"" brought dolphins into the hearts and minds of people everywhere and gave them fame and demand around the world. O'Barry got to know these creatures and lived with them for many years before realizing how much captivity was causing them emotional and physical pain. Dolphins would actually get depressed and die. I have my doubts about the dolphin death of Cathy that he called a ""suicide"" but regardless of what you believe, there are more than enough dolphinariums in the world. This documentary really shows how the capture of dolphins for shows and zoos enables a greater crime going on.

In Taiji, dolphins are herded into a number of restricted areas like coves and nets are put into place to trap them there. After some buyers come by and pick out dolphins for their exhibits at a whopping $150,000 a dolphin, the rest are slaughtered for meat at the price of around $600 a dolphin. Dolphin meat is undesirable and filled with mercury and during the making of this documentary was being fed to children for a mandatory school lunch. There is also a misconception among the lawmakers in the Japanese culture that the whales and dolphins are depleting their country's main resource: fish instead of the concept that people might be the actual culprit. It is claimed by this movie that approximately 23,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in Japan each year. The Japanese people themselves appear unaware of what is going on.

The film alleges that Japan attempts to ""buy"" votes from small struggling island countries in the International Whaling Commission to push forward their agenda of repealing the ban on commercial whaling. It shows useless fishery buildings paid for by Japan with their flags on them that house chickens or nothing at all.

There is a bit of reality show element with setting up of cameras, dealing with Japanese trying to stop the filming, uncomfortable interviews, but the numbers and footage really speaks for itself. There are allogations that the film is propaganda and it surely is. People ask why should dolphins be any different than Westerners cows and chickens, but the film pushes forth the facts about dolphin intelligence and similarities to human nature. Beyond that, I think the dolphin's permanent smile has a way of gaining empathy. They are beautiful, smart creatures and their plight is so cruel and meaningless. It really opens the door for why not save other creatures as well, why just these ones? In any case this should stop.

O'Barry now makes it his life's work to free captive dolphins, but from what I'm seeing, dolphins he succeeds in freeing might someday be at risk for a worse fate at the hands of a Japanese fisherman. The most important thing now is getting the word out and getting conversations going about these atrocities so that they can be stopped.

If anyone has seen the South Park episode from Season 13 about Whale Wars and The Cove, it seems funny how ridiculously violent the cartoons are and the reasons for exterminating the ""pests"" of dolphins and whales. After you see the footage though, Trey Parker and Matt Stone really did not exaggerate in the cruelty of the actual killings.

But I just want to let people know that you should so some research and try to understand the subject from Japanese's point of view, and not get too emotionally worked up by their sensationalized view point. I find the film highly ethnocentric and anthropocentric. The only constructive and objective argument is the high mercury content of dolphin meat, which I agree shouldn't be served in school lunches. Everything else is sensationalized. Yes I know, dolphins are cute - it hurts to see them get slaughtered like that, but they are not endangered and if this small town in Japan have been doing it for long time then it is probably sustainable and built into the ecosystem. I'm also slightly offended by how disrespectful they portray the fishermen and local residence. I mean, at least give that guy a name... Private Space? c'mon. It's quite amazing that Japan is willing to even play this film in their theaters.

We all need to watch this film and learn from it.  Buy a DVD.  Then, watch it again and again.  There are couple of scenes that I will never forget for the rest of my life.

Dolphins are intelligent mammals that communicate and interact with human beings in a way no other mammals do.  They are wild and free.  We must leave them as they are.  I hear some arguments, ""this is our way of life.  this is our culture,"" etc.  This is not a strong argument.  All civilized people know how to write the wrongs as they learn.  The killings could have been the tradition in Taiji, Japan.  But the slaughtering of these beautiful and  intelligent creature cannot sustain to be a tradition forever.

Dolphins are not farmed animals.  The slaughtering of dolphins in Taiji, Japan is like people round up wild wolfs in a corral and slaughter them one by one by spear.  They do this almost everyday during the season.  Imagine 20,000+ of them a year.  It is staggering and horrifying.

3965544,5,B002PLMJ74,"What do you do when politicians, unions, the news media, environmentalists and others know about a big social problem, but refuse to do anything about it? Why, you gather together some high-tech equipment, assemble a crack team of techies, activists and divers, infiltrate the hidden secret and then present the documented evidence to the world. That is exactly what director Louie Psihoyos has done with this film, ""The Cove"", taking guerrilla filmmaking to a higher level and earning all the accolades that this film has been getting.

In this case, the ""hidden secret"" is the capturing and slaughtering of thousands of dolphins each year in the small fishing town of Taiji, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. The lead protagonist in the film is dolphin trainer Ric O'Barry of ""Flipper"" fame, who is public enemy No. 1 in Taiji for his open opposition to the dolphin killing. He's also not real popular among the aquarium-type theme parks (called the ""captivity industry"") worldwide that do big business buying dolphins directly from Taiji.

So to document the slaughter, the use of hidden cameras in the nearby woods, a sound recorder in the cove of Taiji and a remote-controlled helicopter are creatively employed. To pull it off, of course, you need experts in their craft to carry out the missions and avoid getting busted by the Japanese police. In fact, looking at the documentary as a whole, it's amazing how the filmmaking team even managed to get it all done and get the movie into theaters and onto DVD in the first place.

To help balance things out in ""The Cove"" there is also coverage of the International Whaling Commission gatherings (useless though they are) as well as an interview with a Japanese government official in Tokyo. Two local politicians in Taiji, at great risk to themselves, also offer a few comments on camera about toxic dolphin meat in Japanese school lunches.

Two issues come up in this film: the brutal treatment of dolphins (in Taiji and elsewhere), and the high rate of mercury found in dolphin meat in Japan that people are eating. In other words, animal rights and human welfare. The film does a good job of presenting those two issues as equally important and worthy of our attention and action.

For me, ""The Cove"" represents guerrilla filmmaking at its best and shows us the future possibilities for broadening even more this Renaissance of documentary filmmaking that we see happening around the world these days. The excellent editing of various dolphin footage and a top-notch musical soundtrack also help to make this a movie that should not be missed.

3965546,5,B002PLMJ74,"Well I rented this one and didn't even know it was a documentary, I heard something about stealth and dolphins and a mysterious cove and rapidly discovered that the cove is in Taiji, Japan where they routinely herd hundreds of dolphins into a secret enclosure and massacre them.  A few dolphins are taken alive and sold off to institutions such as Seaworld; as they say in the documentary, a ""good"" dolphin can sell a million dollars in tickets.  One of the most interesting aspects of the documentary is Richard O'Barry who was the original dolphin trainer for the tv show Flipper and is somewhat responsible for their popularity as trick performers in tanks.  Unfortunately any dolphin in captivity can be regarded as clinically insane.  O'Barry goes a long way toward redeeming himself by freeing and saving dolphins all over the world, and unmasking the regularly scheduled horror in Taiji that is also a scam perpetrated against the Japanese public.  Much of the dophin meat is sold as whale meat and contains extremely high levels of mercury, several hundred times what is recommended as safe, and this in itself attests to the impact of humans on the planet, as mercury is produced in the atmosphere primarily by coal fired power plants.
The documentarians gather a team of individuals willing to take risks to plant cameras in Taiji, and there are tense moments as fishermen and police tail O'Barry and his team.  There are huge amounts of money and Japanese pride at stake here; let's not forget that at least two cetacean activists have been murdered.  Live dolphins command $150 000 on the ""open"" market, and the rest of the kill commands relatively high prices as ""whale meat.""  O'Barry takes a DNA specialist with him to test products in Japanese supermarkets that are sold as whale, and he also tests for mercury.  Much of the whale is dolphin and it is very toxic.
 I personally cannot watch slaughter and fast forwarded through the scene the documentary built toward; but this is the type of film that can change things, that pierces the veil and affords us a long hard look at our own species and how the environment is suffering, some of it from indifference, much of it from ignorance, and some of it is just wanton greed and cruelty.",1266883200,11,2253,4.783505154639175
3965547,5,B002PLMJ74,"About 3/4 of the way through THE COVE, I nearly turned it off. Not because it was a bad film, but because it was almost too painful to keep watching. I grew up, like many my age, watching the hit TV show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flipper/dp/B00000F61N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flipper</a>. It was a great adventure going along with Bud, Sandy, their dad and, of course, Flipper the dolphin. I used to pretend to swim with him (Flipper) and thought it would be the coolest thing to be able to feed and play with a dolphin. So it was doubly troubling to see Ric O'Barry (the man who helped capture and train Flipper) as the centerpiece for this film. After watching the original Flipper die in captivity, Ric learned a hard lesson: that creatures with this kind of intelligence should never be kept in captivity, nor should they be harmed.

Fast forward to today, and we find Ric in Taijii, Japan near a small cove where, every September, the unthinkable happens. A mass slaughter of hundreds or even thousands of dolphins turns the water (literally) red. The local government and fisherman don't want anyone to see this event, nor even get too close to the cove. Ric and his friends, who simply try to film here, are harassed, pushed away (physically) or arrested on ""pending"" charges. So, in order to get the footage they need, Ric and friends hire specialized cameras and camera operators to hide digital recorders around the cove (including an underwater microphone) so that this atrocity can be witnessed.

They go in like a Navy Seal team, with night-vision and under the cover of darkness. It is an act of incredibly risk because it has become all too apparent that the locals will do anything (including act violently) to protect their secret slaughter. When the recordings come back, and we get to see them, it is ....how to even put it into justifiable words ...it's so painful to watch that I actually got choked up. There's no music playing; nothing to add to the pulling of your heartstrings. The repeated stabbing of the dolphins is ...beyond cruel. They literally bleed to death. But if it weren't tough enough watching that, we get to see the response of the other dolphins while they await their turn. A baby dolphin, probably no more than two feet long, tries to jump out of the water in order to save itself, only to fall back into the red sea and be slashed across the throat. It is this brutal act that will stun most viewers and will undoubtedly spur some into action against Japan's ocean policies.

Not surprising, Japan has been battling to keep it's commercial whaling and fisheries open. And in these tough economic times, it has even found friends in the IWC (International Whaling Commission).

The great thing about the film is that it isn't anti-fishing. It simply asks that this type of senseless slaughter stop. No one eats dolphin (knowingly), and most shouldn't because of the high levels of mercury present in the meat (even sushi-grade tuna has high levels). So why does this slaughter happen? The real answer is individuality and not wanting to be told what to do by outsiders. A few of the dolphins are singled out for ""saving."" They'll become trained dolphins at Seaworld and the like. But the rest become additive fish meat wrapped in plastic in the fresh fish section.

The only downside to the film is that it doesn't address what would happen to the small city of Taijii if the dolphin slaughter were stopped. Would the city survive? What would happen to the fisherman who's livelihood relies on this? If those who really want to affect change are interested in procuring that change, they should make a plan that involves the Taijii fisherman and their future livelihoods if the dolphin slaughter were halted. That would be a great way to succeed in stopping this annual ""event.""

Still, this story was amazingly told and was so tough to watch, that it will linger with me for a very long time.",1266451200,87,3989,4.833089311859443

Ric O'Barry may be the world's premier lover of dolphins, but the one place you'll never find him at is Sea World taking in a show. That's because he'd much rather expend his time and energy in freeing those marvelous creatures from captivity - an act for which he has been arrested numerous times and which has earned him the status of persona non grata in many quarters.  Yet, although O'Barry may be an ""environmental whacko"" (maybe even a ""dangerous criminal"") in the eyes of some, to others - and certainly to the dolphins whose freedom and well-being he champions - O'Barry is a real life hero.

The remarkable, consciousness-raising documentary ""The Cove"" chronicles O'Barry's efforts to make a clandestine video record of a dolphin slaughter that takes place regularly in a secluded cove in Taiji, Japan, far away from public view.  Here thousands of dolphins are trapped, some to be captured and sold to dolphinariums, but most to be brutally massacred for food.  To get his video, O'Barry enlisted the aid of various friends and colleagues, who formed a kind of ""Ocean's Eleven"" special ops team of high-tech video and sound engineers, to pull off the scheme.

Why, some might wonder, should animals like dolphins and whales be protected from such ritualized slaughter when other mammals like cows and sheep are not?  O'Barry would posit that it is because, alone among all God's creatures, the dolphin has a uniquely symbiotic relationship with mankind, as evidenced by tales told from time immemorial of dolphins rescuing humans stranded at sea and even of protecting them from underwater predators such as sharks.  And scientists have certainly shown that the dolphin is second to none among the animal kingdom when it comes to ""intelligence"" and the ability to communicate with one another.  O'Barry goes so far as to argue that dolphins are so self-aware that they even have a sense of their own mortality.

The movie points out the irony that this obsession with training dolphins and whales for show purposes began in the early 1960s with the immense popularity of the TV series ""Flipper.""  In other words, it was people's sudden intense interest in and love for the dolphin that became largely responsible for the desperate plight they're in today.  O'Barry acknowledges his own culpability in this regard since it was he himself who helped to capture and train the five female dolphins that were used in the show.  In the time since that program aired, dolphin-capturing has become a multi-million-dollar-a-year industry, primarily in Japan, and has resulted in ""the largest slaughter of dolphins on the planet"" (to the tune of 23,000 per year in that country alone). But after seeing the harm inflicted on these magnificent creatures by their captivity - dolphins normally swim 40 miles a day in the open waters - O'Barry's views quickly evolved to the point where he became a hardcore activist tirelessly fighting for their liberation.  As he himself states, ""I spent ten years building that industry up, and I spent the last thirty-five years trying to tear it down.""  If nothing else, ""The Cove"" is a story of one man's search for personal redemption.

But ""The Cove"" is much more than simply an informative documentary designed to do good in the world.  It possesses all the drama and suspense of a real-life cloak-and-dagger espionage thriller as we go along with the team as they sneak their video and audio equipment past the authorities and plant it where it will do the most good.  The movie also has all the emotional pull of a classic David and Goliath story, though in this case, there are actually two Goliaths, one, the Japanese fishing industry that is green-lighting the slaughter, and, the other, the farcically impotent International Whaling Commission (an admittedly weaker giant) whose job it ostensibly is to see that the slaughter doesn't happen.  Quite a bit of the movie's running time, in fact, is devoted to showing the rampant corruption of that organization, as we see Japan overtly bribing smaller countries for their votes.

""The Cove"" is definitely hard to watch at times, and the slaughter scene itself is certainly not for the faint-of-heart.  But it is something that cries out to be seen - and acted upon (the movie appropriately ends with contact information for all those interested in helping out the cause).  And director Louie Psihoyos counterbalances the ugliness with gorgeous shots of dolphins swimming freely in the open ocean - objects of matchless grace and beauty in the natural world.  Moreover, the visuals are richly complemented by a lyrical, haunting score by J. Ralph.

No matter your view on the environment, after seeing ""The Cove,"" you will never be able to look at Flipper or Sea World in the same way again.",1265241600,122,4794,4.96375
3965556,5,B002PLMJ74,"I think that all animals in captivity (I will insert wild and not too sick or too old to survive) should be released back into the wild.

  Paul said, ""Why don't they say that ALL ANIMALS should be taken out of captivity?""  Well Paul, making a movie like that would be like writing your PhD thesis paper on the ""history of the world""...much too broad of a topic and therefore ineffective.

  The reason why the main character focuses on dolphins is because due to his role in making the TV show ""Flipper"" so popular,  and the susbsequent popularity of live dolphin-trainer shows, he feels personally responsible for what is happening.  A large number of the dolphins are being sold to dolphin trainers because it is so profitable and he believes it would be less profitable if people understood how unhappy the animals were...something that most people don't understand because they have a perma-smile built into their anatomy.  The dolphin-trainer shows are the cash cow motivator for the people in Taiji.  The cove killings are just a side business that could not survive without their cash cow.

  The film crew felt that the dolphin killing was the most dramatic story, so they used it to push the 'dolphins in captivity' story along.  Understanding the effects of mercury on the human body and seeing how much of it is in dolphin and whale meat paired with the consumers of the meat not knowing what was in the meat or even that they were eating it as it was packaged as something else is a third outrage.  The Japanese consumers have a right to know that their government is allowing the sale of mis-labeled meat and that this meat is toxic.  I lived in Japan for many years.  The government often puts 'saving face' over the welfare of its people, and people speaking out like this is often the only way to get them to 'do the right thing'.

  Many people are not concerned about the welfare of the dolphins, and I might argue that they are somewhat uninformed about how the food chain works and how the mass killings and worse, the mercury poisoning of these animals affects humans.  There is a  'special featurette' available on the disc explaining the issue with mercury poisoning much better and I think they should have included the scientific study by local Japanese scientists on mercury poisoning in the actual movie. Other than that, it was a very well-done documentary that was both fun (to see the 'Mission Impossible' ways they got their footage) and informative to watch.

Greeks punished by death anybody harming a dolphin. People anywhere in the world like dolphins.  Dolphins also like humans.  They accompany us on our boat trips.  They are so nice to see, and also like to play with people in the ocean.  They are famous for saving people's lives.  So I never, ever could imagine that some people, anywhere in the world, would really consider catching and killing this wonderful animal.  Let alone : eat the meat.  I had no clue.

The people doing this excellent documentary are very brave activists.  All the filming was done illegally, because it was impossible to get any footage in a normal way.  Japanese don't want the world to find out, because they know they could be shut down in the end if that happens.  Let's hope their fear will become true.

This documentary is well done.  It took a lot of preparation and you'll see all the ""action"" of putting up the cameras, etc., so that finally footage can be obtained how the trapped dolphins are slaughtered, in images of true horror, filling the sea with blood.  Every year, 23.000 dolphins are killed in Taiji.  The irony is that this dolphin slaughter takes place in a NATIONAL PARK !

Why does Japan support and even subsidize their whaling industry ?

In the International Whaling Commission Japans came up with a presentation that was supposed to demonstrate that dwindling fish populations in oceans were due to increasing number of whales.  Happily, the commission of Brazil was also there to say - on the record - that this power point presentation was ""biological nonsense"".

Richard O'Barry says he even tried to negotiate directly with the dolphin fishermen, offering them the same paycheck for *not* catching dolphins.  But they refused.  They said he didn't understand, that this is all about... ""pest control""...  So, the same argument that Japan uses in the Whaling Commission is repeated by the fishermen !

""The Cove"" is a thought provoking film that captures the horrendous act of slaying dolphins for their meat.

Who would of thought that a small town in Japan, would be killing on average 23,000 dolpins a year?

I've always enjoyed a good documentary, that brings to light things that in which you would normally have no idea about.

The activists in ""The Cove"" not only want to stop the dolphin slayings in Taiga, they want to keep all dolphins out of captivity. Which is a obviously unrealistic task.

In ""The Cove"", they throw together several experts and resources to uncover this story by covert means.

In the movie you realize that they aren't harvesting the dolphin meat for necessity and according to the activists in the film, the dolpin meat is dangerously full of mercury. The majority of the population in Japan, has no idea about the dolphin harvest in Taiga.

This is an eye opening film, mentally stimulating and highly recommended!

The reviewers who are trashing this film are obviously bitter about something, the film isn't propaganda and it isn't a poor documentary as one reviewer says, its actually a very well put together documentary.

While I have my own opinions on whaling and dolphin hunting, I thought it was a bit unfair that the entire movie kept screaming things along the lines of ""We must release all the dolphins from captivity. If you can you must free any dolphin you see. These animals are not meant to be taken out of their environment."" Why don't they say that ALL ANIMALS should be taken out of captivity?

The dolphin blew the ring in front of him and followed it then, like a magician, sliced off a piece to make a new air ring. And he did it again. And again. Then the ring broke into bubbles and floated away.

The other image is of the aftermath of the dolphin slaughter. I would describe it but stealing its thunder would be as criminal as the act it portrays.
