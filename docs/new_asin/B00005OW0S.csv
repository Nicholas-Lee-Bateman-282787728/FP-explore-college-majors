7949293,2,B00005OW0S,"Pride FCs are great, but this one is a bit lacking.  It has only 6 fights and is much shorter than the other Pride FCs I've seen.  Most of the fights were mismatches and overall there was very little excitement.  The biggest reason I bought this disc was because I love both Sakuraba and Belfort as fighters and I wanted to see them fight each other.  Huge disappointment.  I won't say who won, but one of the fighters refuses to fight and just sits down the whole match.  This can actually be an effective defense as Allen Goes proved.  However, in this case is was absolutely disasterous for the fans and for anyone watching.  The fighter was even warned, but went right back down to the ground.  I had heard later it was because he had a broken hand before the fight started.  Regardless, it made for a bad match and poor viewing.  Also included on the disc was an ""exhibition"" with Royler and Rickson Gracie where they displayed some of their techniques.  I was not very interested in this and would much rather have seen either of them fight someone in the tournament.  If you want your Pride fix, go for Pride 8 or Pride GP Finals.",1017014400,3,1137,4.408653846153846
