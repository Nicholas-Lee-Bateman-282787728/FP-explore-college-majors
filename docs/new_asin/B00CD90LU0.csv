5716027,4,B00CD90LU0,My wife & I are new parents and wanted to read and watch as much information that we could get our hands on. I read an article about these DVDs and decided give them a shot. Drs. Birnbaumer and McCollough were pleasant to watch and explained everything in great detail.  The quality and amount of information presented was by far the best compared to other newborn care DVDs on Amazon.. which we also bought.,1369353600,,408,4.513513513513513
5716028,4,B00CD90LU0,"Surviving Infancy is a godsend!!!  I received this DVD set as a gift at my baby shower and I don't know what I would have done without it.  This has so many topics that cover just about everything under the sun. I especially enjoyed watching the hands on CPR and choking demonstrations. It is my biggest fear not knowing what to do if my baby stops breathing and after watching these demonstrations, I feel much more confident that I can effectively save my child's life. Drs. Birnbaumer and McCollough are very knowledgeable and enjoyable to watch.  Oh! and the DVD menu is the best...they made the menus so that you can watch an entire section or single topic easily - a great feature that I had not been able to do in other parenting DVD videos.  I have been given other parenting DVDs and books and they don't even compare. I encourage every new parent to have Surviving Infancy close by when the unexpected happens as it has come in handy countless times for me.",1368576000,,967,4.508571428571429
5716029,5,B00CD90LU0,"As a first time mom, I read everything I could get my hands on and had a lot of unsolicited advice from friends. After watching these videos I received as a gift, I felt they answered any questions I had better then all of the other content I put together. Better, I watched them at home on my own schedule versus having to make it to a class.
These are a must for any baby shower gift you give, or for any mom as there is a lot of information that was surprising and I still use today and my baby is 2.",1367798400,,503,3.8932038834951457
5716030,5,B00CD90LU0,"We have a 20 month old, and since this is a new experience for my wife and I, we were worried we weren't baby proofed or prepared for an emergency.  After watching these DVD's we were ready! We had talked to friends and read stuff online, even got ""advice"" from our parents, but it was a great experience sitting down and watching this and finding out that while we were prepared in many areas, there were some sneaky ones we didn't even think about. I was amazed at how thorough these videos are.

I also liked the way it was presented. I was worried there would be a lot of ""doctor talk"" but the presenters were very good at making sure you understood the topics.

My sister is planning on having a baby this year and I've already bought her a copy. I'd give her mine, but its nice to have a reference around.",1366675200,,811,4.253246753246753

8580454,3,B00CD90LU0,"not what i expected. this has very general, almost common sense information. i was expecting a little more about how to prevent injuries (more on baby proofing) instead of just how to treat and when to go to the ER. it has some good info and a lot that's just common sense. also the hosts talk over each other a lot. worth a watch but nothing groundbreaking.",1411171200,,358,4.358208955223881
8580455,5,B00CD90LU0,"This is a great video to add to any parents' collection, as there are a variety of topics that range from safe-proofing your home to choking.  Everything is so informative and I love the fact that it's all in one place. As a first time parent, it definitely eases a lot of the anxiety that comes when you have no idea what you're doing!",1404950400,,336,4.25

8580460,1,B00CD90LU0,"this video contains inaccurate and incomplete information.  The information in the car seat section is not correct.  In the video it states that children should ride rear facing until the age of 2 which is the current best practice recommendation.  HOWEVER the video states that around 'two-ish' the child gets out of their big car seat but has a harness.  HUH?  This is not accurate information.

The resource they list and talk about in the video and show on the screen is for organic toys.. Healthychild.org.

I think maybe they were trying to instead refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics website Healthychildren.org.  The website they refer to has no car seat information.

All fire departments DO NOT have trained personnel that can help with your car seat.  There is however an entire program and network of trained specialists in car seat safety- at the national level where the training curriculum comes from- nhtsa.gov.  The authors of the video should have consulted a specialist in car seats.  They are out there and there are some very good videos done by InJoy, Living Legacy, CarSeat.org..

This dvd totally misses the mark on car seat safety. Trained Child Passenger Safety Technicians and Instructors do not recommend the use of after market mirrors in the vehicle.  These products are not regulated for safety the way car seats and vehicles are.  There are a lot of unknowns with after market products. Often people are injured from flying debris in crashes, sharp turns and swerves.

Find a certified child passenger technician in your area at nhtsa.gov or safekids.org.  These ladies are probably fine doctors and mention how long they have been in practice many times, however they are not so good as educators.

A lot of time in the video is spent going over leaving children in the vehicle and overheating.  Of course this is a concern but car crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury and death for children, more than all the childhood diseases combined.. far and above overheating injuries.  These topics should be together and the time spent should reflect the actual risk to children.",1383264000,,2130,4.963276836158192
