8431520,4,B004J23KZ2,"I finally got an opportunity to see a Bernard Allison show this summer, at the Bourbon Street Blues Festival in Hackettstown NJ. I was fortunate enough to meet him prior to (and after) his set. He is a great guy, very unassuming. I purchased this because it was his latest live effort; I thought it would capture the essence of what I saw at the show. I was correct. Fine singing and playing by Bernard as well as his band. If you are familiar with his father, Luther, you already have an idea of Bernard's sound, although Bernard is a little more rock while his dad was a touch more R&B. Excellent.",1503360000,,599,4.357142857142857

8431522,5,B004J23KZ2,"Although I didn't purchase this through Amazon, I picked it up at his live show at Chan's in Woonsocket, RI, on Friday, June 8, 2012, I felt compelled to let everyone know that this is one of the best videoes of a concert that I have seen/heard. The musicianship is outstanding, the videography is great and it sounds great. Good job by the production crew. Just buy this video if you're thinking about one of Bernard's performances to witness. I can't imagine you'd be disappointed in any way.",1339286400,2,494,4.625
