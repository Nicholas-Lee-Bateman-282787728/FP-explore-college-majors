8252851,3,B0013TN70C,"Nice Hollywood movie, too bad that it didn't show the effort a soldier went through to become parachutist, nor the joy's of jumping out of a C-47.  Also no mention of Glider troopers.  No PLF's; no 250 tower, no PT - Nice Hollywood movie with Harry Carry, Robert Preston....",1420761600,,274,4.571428571428571
8252852,3,B0013TN70C,"About what I expected.  Like 'Buck Privates' with out Abbot & Costello and the Andrews Sisters.  I got it as the closest  thing to a documentary of the first US Paratrooper Battalion ( the 501st).  Which at the time the movie was made, that's all there was.  Just the one.  Seeing Buddy Epson do a solo dance was a bonus.",1420588800,,321,4.266666666666667

8252854,4,B0013TN70C,"quite entertaining story interwoven with real parachuting
preston and obrien seem suited together as rivals
in the courting of thunderheads daughter
and ebsens dancing and backwoods nature quite amusing
could have been longer with war footage included",1341360000,2,251,5.8108108108108105
8252855,5,B0013TN70C,"In 1941 the government needed to start gearing people up for the way that was on the horizon, so they started encouraging hollywood to come up with ""feature films"" that were often little more than military recruitment exercises.

Parachute Battalion is a good example of this genre. On it's face it's a story, not unlike Officer and a Gentleman, about new recruits at a military training center.

Of course, the real purpose of the movie was to make becoming a parachute soldier look fun and exciting so that they could recruit more troops.

This film, in my view, works on both levels and is much less ham  handed than many similar propoganda films of the era.",1146528000,6,661,4.672413793103448
