8436463,5,B004N741FQ,I was very happy to find these DVD's. Happy with service and quality of the product! Always love Guy any time we can. The show never gets boring and always makes me laugh! He's a natural!,1355011200,,187,4.222222222222222
8436464,5,B004N741FQ,"Someone else reviewing this show called it ""food porn."" And that's about right. After I watch one of these shows I want to run out and have a slab of ribs or a gigantic burger or eggs benedict or... But sensibly, I don't. Well, maybe once a month. Guy is a total character who's incredibly passionate and fun to watch. This is the most entertaining food show I've seen since the Two Fat Ladies were roaming the UK on their old motorcycle. Really a food show, though, and not a cooking show. I was very lucky to score this two season set for only $5 at Target.",1333929600,,559,4.233644859813084
8436465,5,B004N741FQ,"I'm a foodie, so I always enjoy it when I get recommendations to check out. Guy Fieri's recommendations comprise what is probably the perfect family-friendly list of places where you can take your wife & kids for good food without breaking the bank. While I may still be waiting for him to find places to go in all 50 states (he DOES know the Black HIlls are in the Dakotas, right?), DDD tops the Zagat guide in my never-humble opinion.",1306454400,,436,4.4625
