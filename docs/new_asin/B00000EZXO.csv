All I can tell you is that all your favorite characters are here for the final installment, and it is just as funny and gorgeous as the others.  If you liked the previous videos, you will enjoy this.",980208000,,331,4.32258064516129
7906158,4,B00000EZXO,"The second OAV isn't something you can pass up if you're a fan of El Hazard.  It picks right up as if it were an extension of the first, rather than an independent sequel movie.  All your favorite characters are there (pretty much) just the way you remember them, and the animation is just as extraordinary. However, I strongly reccomend watching the first OAV before this one, as newcomers to El Hazard will be completly lost.  If you are only familiar with the TV series, be aware that there are substantial differences and you probably won't get into it until episode 2.  There is no expository information, and episode one is mostly a romantic comedy, which will be lost on those not familiar with the OAV characters.  The plot and action pick up after that, and overall the movie is a worthy sucessor to the first.
The characters are engaging and their strength is well tempered with shortcomings that endear them to the viewer. Miz, Fatora, and Jinnai are especially entertaining in the sequel.  The battles are fast paced and smoothly animated, and after episode 1 the plot progresses without any major hitches, though it is less robust than the first OAV.  I was dissapointed also by the lack of development of Ifurita's character.  Reasonably minor complaints for a great show, and if you haven't seen the first OAV this series one of my absolute favorites, I definitely reccomened it.",971913600,2,1394,4.779166666666667
