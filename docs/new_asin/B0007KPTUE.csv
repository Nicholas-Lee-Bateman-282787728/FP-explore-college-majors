8047783,5,B0007KPTUE,"I saw this film when it was released in 1970. It is the best depiction on the Battle of Waterloo ever produced without question. The sheer scope of this production is unbeleivable. The Yugolslavian army is basically the cast who portray the Allied and French armies. Steiger is excellent in this role of Napoleon appearing quixotic and manic. Wellington played by Christopher Plummer is the best for the role supported by Jack Hawkins as the feisty General Picton. The calvary charge by the Scots Greys was surreal and awesome in its effect and who could forget the ""squares"" formed by the Allied troops to fend off the massive and misguided calvary charge led by Marshal Ney (Dan O'Herlihy). The achievement is monumental and could never be repeated and the cost would be staggering. Totally underated and appreciated but if you a student of the Napeolonic Wars this is a must see!",1247788800,,882,4.847682119205298

It was sadly unappreciated when it was first released, but I could not understand why Paramount still never released it on DVD, considering all the trash that's constantly being produced. I have a VHS copy, but finally ordered this DVD version. This was made by the very prominent Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk, and it is magnificent. My rating for this review is for a combination of the film, one of my all time favorites, and for the distributor which delivered it to my home in 4 days, in very neat bubble wrap envelope. I highly recommend this version. Despite the box print, the menus are in English, as is the film language. Unfortunately, I don't recommend watching it in Russian, because they simply 'speak' over the film, without correctly replacing the English track and dubbing the voices properly. Nonetheless, I am happy with this DVD, which appears to have additional scenes or moments that do not appear in the VHS version, the better to enjoy.

8047785,4,B0007KPTUE,"While some errors and ommisions exist, and a bit of poetic licence, this is still a grand scale portrayal of that famous battle. With a cast of thousands ( a substantial part of the Russian army ) this s a never to be repeated demonstration of a Napoleonic battle. At times you feel you must duck for cover

If you are interested in napoleonic warefare, this is your chance.",1145318400,2,374,4.420289855072464
8047786,5,B0007KPTUE,"This re-creation of the battle of Waterloo will never be surpassed. The advent of special effects means that it will never again be possible for such a massive array of manpower to be assembled in order to make a motion picture, and therefore the portrayal of this mighty conflict will never be equalled for realism. The scenes are stupendous and awe-inspiring, and make one constantly marvel at the sheer magnitude of the achievement and control of this gigantic cast. It is probably necessary to have some prior knowledge of the course of the battle, but repeated viewings will eventually make everything clear. The performances of Plummer and Steiger are absolutely top-notch: both truly give superlative impersonations of the two major protagonists. Since they were so different in character and personality it is impossible to say which is the better. The unfolding of the events, and the contextualization of this epic encounter, are also extremely well-written and directed. Of course, all the classic incidents and quotes are retained, which may sometimes strike one as a touch over-familiar: but how could they be omitted? An excellent balance is maintained throughout, and the overall effect is nothing short of astonishing. It is extremely difficult to understand why this film has not been more widely recognized and appreciated.",1127174400,8,1341,5.271028037383178
