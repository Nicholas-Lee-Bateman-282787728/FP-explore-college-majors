8318023,5,B001LGC2N0,"They don't make shows like this anymore, mores the pity. There are so many great stars that appear in his tv show,it's hard to say who's the best, but one of the high lights was the one and only Judy Garland, always the best even when she wasn't on best form she still sang better than anyone then and now. Also Pearl Baily was wonderful with Mr Williams. Worth every penny.
