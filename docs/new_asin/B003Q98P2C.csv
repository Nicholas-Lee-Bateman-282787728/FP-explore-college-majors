Passionate Motive

Mvil pasional (1993)

First of all, the audio is horrible and very difficult to hear, add to that, a Venezuelan 'slang' that is spoken very fast. Still, if you speak Spanish at a basic level, you can understand most of it.

The film looks like something from the 80's, but it was 1993. It's odd in some ways, with drab colorless shots of sleazy people and the sleazy city at night.

At the start of Movil pasional, some man is knifed by a man wearing a stocking on his head.  He goes into the house and up the stairs and finds a woman on the bed, whom he touches and later hits.  Next, the interrogation room of a police precinct where some cop is interrogating a couple.  I guess the place is some Venezuelan city, but the Spanish sounds a lot like Cuban Spanish.  The cop later picks up some street walker and takes her to his apartment where he has a cat.  The cop smokes in every scene and he's a real slimy creep, at least that's what I thought.  All the cops in this film are thoroughly unlikeable, corrupt and real sleazy.

The street walker is in love with the cop, but he doesn't respond.  He uses her for sex and as an informant.  He's on the case of the man who was knifed by the man who was wearing a stocking on his head.  Some insurance agent talks to the cop, telling him that he suspects the wife of the man who was knifed.  The cop follows leads, smoking a lot and finds that the wife of the man who was knifed had some lover who was in prison.

The cop tries to break the wife, but her lover who was in prison covers for her.  The street walker also has an affair with the lover who was in prison.  The cop doesn't care much, but wants to crack the murder case.  It turns out the lover of the wife did kill her husband, because he was jealous of him.  Yet, he never implicates the wife.  The street walker comments that that is ""true love"".  The film ended quite abruptly with the street walker walking in the street.

My DVD was censored, so there is no nudity or expletives in any of the film.

I kept thinking they would end it with a another tragedy, but I was wrong. Nonetheless, it's a somewhat interesting film.  Don't be fooled, it isn't profound, very good or even grand, but just a snapshot of low budget Latin American filmmaking.

It seems to be a remake of Locura pasional (1956) with Silvia Pinal and Carlos Lopez Moctezuma.

If you like low budget foreign films that concentrate on slow characterization, then you might like this one.

8402204,4,B003Q98P2C,"I am very grateful to Tallinnfilm for making movies like this available with English subtitles. Pilot Pirx's Inquest is a Polish/Soviet production from 1979, based around the Pirx short stories of Polish SF author Stanislaw Lem. As the movie begins, it doesn't look like anything special. It pretty much seems to take place in the present (except for some slightly more advanced video facilities). The interesting stuff starts one third into it, when Pirx meets the crew that is going to accompany him on a test flight to Saturn. This crew consists of both humans and humanoid androids, and neither Pirx nor the audience know which are which. The purpose of the test flight is to determine how well the androids will perform compared to their human counterparts, and for this Commander Pirx needs to evaluate them without prejudice, i.e. without knowing which are androids. Pirx sees it as his first duty, however, to figure out which ones are androids, and he starts by asking them Turing test questions, like ""do you believe in conscience"" and ""how much X-ray radiation can you tolerate"". His intuition tells him that knowing the difference between the androids and the humans will also turn out to be the difference between life and death, and this of course turns out to be true.

The space flight to Saturn is very well made for an east-European 1979 movie. It is generally convincing, and you never start groaning because of low-budget cheesiness. Considering the rather pedestrian look of the first third of the movie, I didn't expect that the space flight would look like much, but I think they managed to make it look very good. There were a few obvious plot points that I thought they would use, and which would have helped the clarity of the story, but they didn't quite do it that way. So as a whole the movie is not super-brilliant and among the best sci-fi movies ever, but neither is it among the bad ones. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'll give it a 7 or an 8.

On first viewing I didn't think the motivation of the bad android made any sense, but in retrospect I guess it does. It's a good movie that raises interesting (and still current) questions about artificial intelligence, and generally contains ""hard SF"" elements, i.e. elements that are within scientific realism. The movie doesn't seem to me to be terribly well-rounded, but I have a feeling I just need to watch it once or twice more in order for the whole picture to gel properly in my mind. Definitely a rare gem of a sci-fi movie that deserves a place in any sci-fi fan's movie collection.",1289001600,9,2567,4.664459161147903
