4219186,5,B003Y5H57E,"Looks like I'm just another of several to give this romantic comedy 5-stars. Crazy, Stupid, Love isn't your traditional romantic comedy. You can tell this when Julianne Moore tells Steve Carrell, her husband of almost 25 years, that she wants a divorce. From there, the movie breaks off into parts, following Carrell as he hits the singles scene and fails miserably until being aided by hilarious ladies man Ryan Gosling. This movie is more about finding lost love again after losing it.

Gosling spends weeks tutoring Carrell on how to pick up women, while his ex-wife is struggling with her own choice to break up her marriage by having an affair with a coworker played by Kevin Bacon. Meanwhile, Carrell and Moore's 13 year old son has a crush on his cute 17-year old baby sitter. She however, isn't returning his love, because she has a crush on an older man. Emma Stone plays a young law student about to pass the bar exam, and being wooed by a nerdy boyfriend (Josh Groban) and ignoring the advances of Gosling. Sounds complicated? Well its really quite simple as the movie follows how crazy and stupid love can be as the characters try and find their one true soul mate.

The movie is really good because of the strong cast. Each plays their part perfectly and there are lot of laughs, especially at the few twists at the end. The climax at the 8th grade graduation could have been handled better, but overall I really liked this movie. The triangle between the babysitter, the older man and the kid had a few moments that I believed cross the line (issues involving sexting) but this is a movie for adults, so kids shouldn't be seeing it anyway.

As Steve Carrell moves past his successful stint on THE OFFICE, I hope he will make more movies like this.",1313193600,35,1761,4.601910828025478
4219187,5,B003Y5H57E,"I had lost faith in romantic comedies for a while now--always the same plot, the same clich&eacute;s, and the chemistry between the characters was not very believable. And while I can't guarantee you that this is the perfect movie, it was a refreshing, funny, and original story.

You'll find out what the movie's about in the first ten minutes: Emily (Julianne Moore) announces she hasn't been faithful and wants a divorce. This leaves Cal (Steve Carell) in a downwinding spiral. He's never been single since he was 15, and he's never been with anyone else...that leaves a lot of room for him to make mistakes with all sorts of new women as he tries to cope with the anguish of losing his soul mate. Enmeshed in this movie are also subplots about the romantic interests of his children's babysitter, his son, and his new friend from the bar, a confident young bachelor who helps Cal refine and redefine himself.

You'll get practically everything in this film that a great movie is supposed to have: believable relationships, excellent popular culture references, and the kind of wry humor Steve Carell is famous for (as seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinner-for-Schmucks/dp/B004AV5GX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinner for Schmucks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001GMAVGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>).

4219188,5,B003Y5H57E,"A lot of laughs, shenanigans, and some actual drama.

I was fortunate enough to see this last year during a special screening of the movie. A simple romantic comedy with some drama adding to make it real.

Steve plays a guy whose wife Emily is having an affair. Steve has lost confidence in himself as the marriage is crumbling.

Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who is gonna help Cal get his mojo back and his wife.

Steve Carell plays Cal as good as you'd expect. With Carell's comedy background, he makes the role very lovable and entertaining. Julianne Moore is a good actress, so she's able to portray the guilty wife pretty well.

Gosling has already played bad boys pretty well, so this role is not a stretch for him. Nevertheless, he and Carell have great chemistry on screen.

There's also a side story with Cal's kid in love with the teenage babysitter who has a very adult crush on Cal.

Emma Stone also does good as Hannah, the girl about to be married to a guy who may or may be the one for her.

All in all it's a nice little comedy. You come away pretty satisfied, and movie does give you a lasting impression.",1312675200,,1119,4.398058252427185
4219189,5,B003Y5H57E,"Sometimes I go to the movies expecting something great and the movie turns out to be less than and sometimes I go to the movies expecting little or nothing and the movie turns out to be wildly better than I had expected. The latter is the case with ""Crazy Stupid Love"".

 A romantic comedy as you might expect. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore sit in a restaurant after a large meal. They were married right out of high school, always together, now with three kids. They say, ""I can't decide what I want. Let's say what we want on the count of three, one, two three."" Carell says ""Crme Brule""; Moore says ""I want a divorce"". That sets the stage for what comes next. Moore wants more. She is cheating on him with Kevin Bacon's character.

 Carell gets kicked out of his home, no wife and children. Drunk in a bar he bemoans his fate to anyone listening, he says he is a ""cuckold"", he bemoans the fact that women don't like him. The young stud womanizer Ryan Gosling hears this raving, feels sorry, offers him a fashion makeover and his favorite stud pickup lines to help him with women. I will not give away more plot but the movie is well worth your time, with lots of commentary on current relationship etiquette.

There is a great scene where Carell's date, played by Marisa Tomei, stands on top of a table in a short blue dress and four inch spike heels and proceeds to do a wild, drunken belly flop on top of Carell (see box cover). Pretty, wide blue-eyed Emma Stone plays a smart young lawyer who has heard all the pickup lines. Carell's tween son as a crush on his teen babysitter who is a head taller than him.

Emma Stone has come out of nowhere to have three movies out at the same time, this one, ""The Help"" and a bit part in ""Friends with Benefits""! Pretty, attractive and an actress I predict great things from her. She was the high school temptress in the movie ""Easy A"" .

The revelation here is Carell, he can act! He has played a buffoon in ""The Office"" for years, he slows great depth and emotional sensitivity here.. Very funny situations and touching!.

 Amidst all the plethera of predictable super-hero movies this summer, this is a breath of fresh air. A funny movie with good acting, clever dialog, based in reality, with commentary on the nature of Love. The surprise hit of the season. Out of nowhere!",1312675200,5,2325,4.426229508196721
4219190,5,B003Y5H57E,"I was totally expecting to be bored watching this movie and that it would be a waste of money.  Boy was I wrong.  I never laughed so much at a movie in a long long time.  Steve Carell is absolutely awesome.  Ryan Gosling is more than just a pretty face in this, but it's a plus.  So can't wait to get it on DVD so I can laugh some more.  LOVE IT!!!",1312588800,6,348,3.763888888888889
4219191,5,B003Y5H57E,"I thought this movie was fabulously funny and warm-hearted, poignant and tender, bitter and sweet. In other words, just like our real relationship(s) in life. Steve Carell was brilliant as the cuckolded husband who had to find his groove (again) after slipping into the humdrum of benign neglect, Ryan Gosling couldn't have been better in the role of the dazzling womanizer who surprised himself by falling in love, Julianne Moore nailed it as the wife who couldn't quite figure out what she wanted now that she'd up-ended everything and everyone. Every one of the youngsters in the film had such sweetness to them, and yet were so real, just like any kid of their various ages. Emma Stone was just the right balance of vulnerable woman and strong.

When we finally see how all the pieces of this seemingly random puzzle come together, it's brilliant. Couldn't be better, or more touching-while-funny. In fact, I was in a full theater of mostly 50's and 60's age adults, and the place rocked with laughter from the start of the film to the finish.

This is a movie NOT to be missed!",1312502400,192,1082,4.71957671957672
4219192,5,B003Y5H57E,"My mom and I went to see this movie.  We both like Steve Carell.  I was not sure the type of movie this would be.  I could have been like 40 year old virgin and had sexual things through out, or it could have been a romantic type movie like Dan in real life.  Luckily it was like the second.  In the movie Carells character is shocked to hear his wife wants a divorce.  In fact, it is all he can think about.  He goes to a club and talks about it day after day.  This is what catches the eye of a man who has no trouble getting ladies.  The mans name is Jacob.  He sees carells character moping and realizes he needs help.  So, he goes over to him and they become friends.  He tells him what he has to do in order to get more woman.  Be then just to sleep with, he wants to help him.  While this is going on, Carells son is in love with a girl who man be in love with his dad, while at the same time the man who is teaching Carells character how to play women may be about to fall in love with someone Carells character is close to!

The movie was great.  It told you just enough about the characters for you to care what happened.  You wanted Carells character to be happy, but you probably will not be sure if you would rather him be with other women or his wife.  The story is kind of 60/40.  60% is about Carells character trying to figure out what love really is and means to him and the other 40% has to do with another girl and Jacob who is played by Ryan Gosling.  As I said earlier, the movie could have went on the sexual humor track and had things through out talking about sex and showing the men having sex.  But, as luck would have it they stayed away from that type of story.  This movie will make you laugh, feel sad and make you care about the characters.  Also, there are some romantic movies that try to make you feel sorry for or like one of the people in the couple more than the other.  I didn't feel that in this movie.  While Carell and his wife are apart, you never feel like either one really likes it.  You get the feeling that they themselves are wondering if it is the right thing to do.  One or both of them may at times be with other people.  But, they just seem numb after.  Also, the end of the movie is great because it may leave a question as to wither or not Carells character and his wife like, hate or still love one another.  I am so happy this was a great movie.  I look forward to adding it to my collection when it comes out on blu ray!",1312416000,,2478,3.9554655870445345
4219193,5,B003Y5H57E,"This film centers on love and the problems in relationships, as well as human cravings, failings, growth, and successes in heterosexual companionship. It is well acted, funny, and moving.

All the actors are great, starting with Ryan Gosling (who is always fantastic), and also Steve Carell, Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and the child actors, Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton.

Gosling as the cool guy who can pick up and bed almost any beautiful woman he wants is amazing. In addition, he tutors Carell (a self-described ""cuckolded husband"") to successfully wind up with women in bars. Tomei is also terrific as a horny schoolteacher, as is Stone as a young lawyer who resists Gosling's advances, Moore as Carell's wife and Bacon as the guy at work with whom she has an affair.

The script is intricate and surprising at times, as the characters turn up unexpectedly here and there.

The film not only has many humorous lines, but also makes you care about the characters--a winning combination for a romantic comedy.",1312070400,3,1042,4.971264367816092
4219194,5,B003Y5H57E,"Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a sweet romantic-comedy about sweet people from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the duo behind last year's overlooked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-You-Phillip-Morris/dp/B002ZG9800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love You Phillip Morris</a>. This is a film with genuine characters that follows the conventions of a Hollywood romantic-comedy but succeeds on the strengths of the well-written script by Dan Fogelman. Maturely written, it handles the romantic exploits of adults and children and puts equal emphasis on both. This is one of the few films of late that has a sub-plot about adolescent love that takes the character seriously rather than needlessly padding out the story. Emotions are allowed to naturally unfold instead of being dictated by what is required of the plot. This is written by someone who knows what he's doing and directed by two men who know how to lead their actors through the story to maximum effect.

Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is having dinner with his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) when she abruptly announces that she wants a divorce. Cal is stunned, especially by her admission that she has slept with her co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Almost overnight, Cal moves into his own apartment and spends his nights moping at a local bar. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a smooth-talking womanizer with a remarkable gift of getting beautiful women to accompany him home every night, sees Cal and offers to help him become irresistible to women. This comes after Jacob has just met Hannah (Emma Stone), whom he can't seem to shake from his mind. Meanwhile, Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has fallen for his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to harbor a crush on Cal. Parallel plot threads like this tend to bring trouble for writers, who tend to push one thread to the side in favor of another. Not here. Everyone is given equal attention and is fleshed-out appropriately. The way the plot threads eventually come together in a surprising and hilarious confrontation is easily one of the film's highlights.

The characters are very believable and extremely likable. Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a comedy, but the humor comes from the way characters handle their emotions. The characters never seem to be consciously attempting humor and the film only rarely does. Directors Ficarra and Requa know comedy and actors, which is likely why both are so well utilized. There are some great actors, some well-known and some not, who appear to be enjoying themselves while perfectly capturing the essence of their characters.

This is a film that gets far with a talented screenwriter and some talented directors, but the overall quality rests on the shoulders of the ensemble that bring the story to life and, for this film, they can't be overlooked or ignored. Carell is the everyman, cynical and hurt over his divorce. Gosling, who after massive success with The Notebook seemed to retreat from the mainstream for more personal roles, is so suave and electrifyingly charming, it's easy to accept some of the dialogue he gets away with. Stone, who seems to get better with every new film, has an uncanny ability to light up the screen and the chemistry she and Gosling share is absolutely smoldering. Marisa Tomei also has this light up the screen ability and still does even with a small role. Moore makes the adulterous Emily such a sympathetic character that it's impossible to harbor any ill-will towards her. Finally, for the third time in 2011, Kevin Bacon appears as the ""bad guy,"" David Lindhagen, a sweet man who feels guilt about his role in the dissolution of a marriage but also feels strongly about Emily. I question whether Bacon is intent on playing every variation of a villain he can. Even the younger actors do good work and the sub-plot about Robbie trying to woo Jessica is convincingly written and poignantly acted.

Crazy, Stupid, Love. does not alter the foundation of Hollywood romantic-comedies, but even at its most formulaic, it's done right. It maintains such a positive tone that even Robbie's graduation, the film's most generic scene, is warm and adorable. The film is equal amounts comedy and drama, but the genre elements blend splendidly to create a surprisingly wonderful movie. It's not a great film, but it works so well that there's very little to criticize. It's just so...sweet.

GRADE: A-",1312070400,6,4459,5.170360110803324
4219195,5,B003Y5H57E,"Has any genre fallen further into formulaic drivel than the studio romantic comedy?  Hollywood churns these out, year and after year, becoming less and less distinct as they go along.  The romantic comedy has consumed more potentially promising young actresses than I care to count (remember the late 1990s, when Jennifer Lopez was hot off ""Selena"" and ""Out of Sight"" and looked to be a young actress worth following?).  ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" comes from co-directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa, previously responsible for the entertainingly oddball Jim Carrey film ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" (seen by not nearly enough people, incidentally), who, while not exactly breaking all the conventions, are making a determined effort to do things differently.  The result is a big success, and I imagine that, much like their previous film, it will not attract nearly the initial audience that it deserves.  I can't recall a studio romantic comedy in recent times that has entertained me as much as this one.  Spoilers follow.

""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" falls into a largely discontinued subgenre, the 'comedy of remarriage' - it fell out of style with the explosion of the divorce rate (or actually before that), but was very popular in the age of screwball comedy (""The Philadelphia Story"", for instance).  We open with Cal (Steve Carell, playing it fairly straight) and Emily (Julianne Moore, who I used to think couldn't do comedy very well, but she's done a few recently that worked), married for 25 years when Emily blurts out that she has had an affair and wants a divorce.  Cal grants this with unseemly equanimity, and settles into the life of a bitter divorcee hanging out in a bar and regaling everyone with his story.  This eventually prompts the intervention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling, straying outside the indie drama for the first time in a while), a ladies man who vows to help Cal recover his masculinity.  Cal gets a makeover, and tries his hand at womanizing, starting with Kate (Marisa Tomei).  Jacob, meanwhile, is flirting with articling law student Hannah (rising star Emma Stone, enjoyable as always).  And Cal and Emily's only son, 13-year-old Robbie (Jonah Bobo), has a crush on the sitter, 17-year-old Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who in turn secretly crushes on Cal.

The handling of the ensemble cast is not completely perfect; some of the supporting characters go away for decent stretches of the running time (Jessica, especially).  Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, as the married couple's significant flings, are both underused, especially Bacon.  However, there's a wonderful depth to things.  Carell and Moore have lovely chemistry as a couple that has been together for a quarter-century and is now at odds (Moore has played the cheating spouse a number of times in the last few years, I must say).  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the somewhat caddish Jacob, and plays very well off both Carell and Stone.  The kids are also well-done, with Tipton making a believably awkward teenage girl.  Tomei, for all her limited screentime, has a lot of the most purely comedic stuff in the script, and does very well with it.  While there is the aforementioned issue of juggling all the characters, the script is otherwise very smart, and incorporates a number of surprise reveals that are almost impossible to guess while also playing very fair with the audience (the big one near the end is, on reflection, really well-done; I had earlier thought that it seemed odd that a couple married for 25 years had a 13-year-old as their eldest child).

Highly recommended.  Hollywood really should try to make more like this.",1311984000,,3623,4.9916805324459235

I am not a fan of romantic comedies, and this one does make me cringe toward the end as all loose ends move toward being neatly tied off. However, it is chock full of great scenes, three or four of which I watch  obsessively. Ryan Gosling is OMG sexy. Analeigh Tipton and Emma Stone model the kind of young adult women I hope my daughters grow into.

I ended up losing 2 hours of my life before it was over. This movie truly s..ks. I should do everyone a favor and sneak in a spoiler so people won't watch this. I'll sneak this in..visualize things you would even think of being so stupid as to let happen as a 13 year old boy. Think about things you couldn't dream of your 17 year old daughter doing or yourself if your 17. I mean really. I could go on and on and on..implausible, shallow and stupid....

I'm not sure why I like it so much; it's a good story, with great actors doing great acting, but it's not Oscar-movie material. Still, I find myself wanting to see it again about once a year - and I seem to find some new perspective on life, or some new insight into the ups & downs of human relationships, every time I do watch it. What brings people together, what keeps them together, what tears them apart, what they learn when their hearts get broken - because it seems to take pain and heartbreak to teach us the lessons of life and love - how they learn to forgive (or not!), where and who they learn the best lessons from - it seems that all of that is continually changing, yet somehow remains the same. I feel the same roller coaster of emotions every time I watch it; and I always see some lesson I think I probably need to learn - or re-learn - about myself and my relationships. I cringe at the word ""Stupid"" used next to ""Love"", but it seems to work in the title.
I bought a used copy, which arrived in excellent condition and MUCH sooner than expected! Made for a great movie night at home.",1489795200,6,1255,4.1687242798353905

This is one of them. Check it out the next time you browse the $5.99 DVD dump in Best Buy.  Think of it as the online-versus-retail version of the Hatfields-versus-McCoys battle.  And I wouldn't bet against Amazon.com.

The best part of this movie is the interaction between ""La La Land"" and ""Gangster"" co-stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. They have established a rare screen chemistry in three films now, with ""La La Land"" their best to date, for which Stone deservedly won the best actress Oscar.

4220912,1,B003Y5H57E,"I'll start off by saying Joyce's most celebrated work featured a pathetic cuck as the main character so perhaps this could have merit - it doesn't. Truly creepy and pathetic behavior from Steve Carell's character trying to ""win"" his wife back when she asserts that its his fault she banged another guy because he wouldn't take her dancing or to play mini golf. Truly disheartening because The Cuck then proceeds to do a bunch of awful things including building a mini golf type thing in the back yard as a romantic gesture instead of continuing to pick up 10's at the bar. Cuck behavior must be genetic because a sub plot of the movie is that his son is in love with a girl who wants to bang our titular Cuck Carell. Though I do love Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is so beautiful, don't you think? This movie sucks.",1479945600,,813,4.426666666666667

What I wasn't impressed with was all the fact that it was only rated PG-13.

There was a lot of sexual undertones and even some sexting (nothing was actually shown but you know what was there or what was meant to be there)

This film represents a watershed, a return to side-splitting, off-beat romantic comedy film making we should be proud of, a comedy to rival ""About A Boy,"" or ""Love Actually"" done by the Brits. It starts off wonderfully with teenage lust and then enters the amoral dating scene including the divorce angst with the gathering opportunists, real and imagined. Steve Carell gets to carry the ball opposite Julianne Moore (his maybe ex) and their 3 kids. At the craziest moment when the playboy (Ryan Gosling) the temptress (Emma Stone) and the teacher (victim) all seem to be heading for a crash something happens:reason and Cupid cast their spell, the characters reflect on their stupidity, weakness etc. and a wonderful moment of courageous self-awareness occurs that heals all, very close to Shakespeare and that is worth celebrating.

Ok, I am done with the negative part.  The positive part was Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  Ryan Gosling nailed his part and it was interesting and fun...as well as he is very hot!  Emma also played her role well and you could feel the chemistry between the two.  So, it obviously wasn't the actors as they are all very good.  The writing left a lot to be desired...a lot!

Marisa Tomei is terrific as Carell's love interest especially when things go awry. Analeigh Tipton is weirdly good as the babysitter who secretly wants Carell while being stalked by Jonah Bobo in the role of Carell's son. Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone, & Julianne Moore all add to the entertainment as this movie climaxes in a satisfying if not so surprising comedic ending.

4222832,5,B003Y5H57E,"Keeping it short and sweet here. This is an outstanding Romantic Comedy with terrific actors who are perfectly cast. The writing doesn't spoon feed you any backstory and expertly puts the pieces together all in good time leaving no loose threads. There's a fun twist that I did not see coming and I urge you not to read any spoilers so you can enjoy its full impact.

The PG-13 rating is accurate but note that while I am comfortable with my 11 & 12 year olds watching many PG-13 movies, this is not one of them because so much of the content is about sex.

Again, every actor is truly wonderful and share excellent chemistry but want to give a shout out to Marisa Tomei who takes a role that could have been cliche and grounds it with truth giving hilarious performance.",1449964800,,771,4.422535211267606

Some of it really stuck w/ me, so I rented it and managed to sit through the whole thing w/ no interruptions.  This isn't the best film ever by any means, but it is a well thought out, well executed film.  The pacing is spot-on, the story is engrossing, with sprinkles of humor thrown in that don't overpower the romantic aspects of the film.  Also, the characters decisions (with the exception of one midway through the film) make sense, even if they are more emotion driven than bulletproof in their logic...This probably won't go down in history as ""a great film"", but it is a 4 star film all the way.",1444608000,,746,4.188811188811189

4223501,5,B003Y5H57E,"CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is a comedy involving young and middle aged urban professionals, and children of the middle aged urban professionals.  Although the film is just a ""throw away"" B-movie, it did make me laugh out loud on five or six occasions, which is something that no other movie has accomplished fir me, during the past several decades.  Despite its length (2 hours and 58 minutes), the movie held my interest from start to finish.  Thus, I give the movie FIVE stars.  The movie is distinguished by the presence of simultaneous and unlikely love triangles.  Perhaps that is why the main characters, Steve Carell and Julianne Moore (the married couple) are named Mr. and Mrs. Weaver, that is, because of the simultaneously woven love triangles.  What is unique about the storyline, is that various people are busily having love affairs with each other (or are at least trying to engage in a love affair), but where they are unaware of the fact that they (the two of them) are already connected to each other in some way.  Don't worry, I do not give away more details on this.

PLOT ELEMENTS.  In short, the story begins when Mrs. Weaver abruptly announces to Mr. Weaver that she wants a divorce.  Mr. Weaver passively accepts this, and he consoles himself by becoming a regular at a watering hole for upscale young professionals.  The plot develops when a likeable smooth operator ( an independently wealthy Ryan Gosling) befriends him, and states that he would like to revise Mr. Weaver's personality, his way of dress, and to teach him how to seduce beautiful women.  The film actually devotes some time to this teaching process, that is, to the makeover of Mr. Weaver.  I very much enjoyed that aspect of the movie, since my former self ( during my teens and early twenties ) could have benefited from a similar teacher.  Actually, I will give away one of the love triangles.  Eventually, Mr. Weaver has been trained enough, so that he is a success, and he succeeds in seducing a lucious young woman.  But at a much later part of this lengthy movie, Mr. Weaver learns that the woman is his 13 year old son's middle school teacher, and the lucious woman learns that Mr. Weaver is the father of the nuisance studenr in her class.  The movie is actually a sex comedy, to some extent, but nothing explicit is disclosed.  The main premise and strength of this movie, is the existence of friendships between pairs of friends, but where one friend remains unaware of an incompatible aspect of the other friend.

COMPARISON WITH 13 GOING ON 30.  Only one movie is remotely similar to this one, and it is 13 Going On 30.  From 13 Going On 30, Sean Marquette (obese boy) and Christa Allen (slender teen girl) have counterparts in two characters in Crazy, Stupid, Love, namely Jonah Bobo (obese boy) and Analeigh Tipton (slender teen girl).  Both movies have the theme of a teen girl falling in love with a man over twice her age.  (That's all I have to say about why the two movies are similar to each other.). In my opinion, 13 Going On 30 was more artfully done, but in contrast, Crazy, Stupid, Love, is too frequently over-the-top to be of lasting interest once the movie is over.

NOSE ISSUE.  As is self evident, the actors include Steve Carell and Kevin Bacon.  I don't know how either one of them ever got a job as an actor.  Carell's nose is too big.  In many scenes in this movie, there is one or another pretty girl, to catch the eye.  But in scenes where there is not any pretty girl, Mr. Carell's freakishly big nose draws the viewer's attention.  Then, there is Mr. Bacon's nose.  What can I say that is not already known, discussed, and published regarding this nose?

CONCLUSION.  FIVE stars because it kept me laughing, and held my interest despite being almost two hours long.",1438732800,,3790,4.625748502994012

4224146,5,B003Y5H57E,I wasn't looking for a comedy but this was rated so highly I decided to watch it anyway. It was just what I needed even though it wasn't what I thought I wanted. It was hilarious and I laughed from the beginning to the end. Steve Carell is a comic genius and one should never pass up an opportunity to watch him at work. And Ryan Gosling? Come on! Seriously. Every movie should have a shirtless Ryan Gosling. Every. Movie. I may have never seen a more a beautiful sight than the one of Ryan in this movie. My heart started racing and it was like I thirsty or hungry or scared or running for my life while on fire all at the same time the way I felt when he took off that shirt. In short- don't rent this movie. Buy it. Seriously. Or else you'll be sitting there with your camera phone taking pictures of Ryan with his shirt off lest your mental image fade away the glory that is the bronzed six pack perfection of this godman.,1425945600,2,926,4.15

4224412,4,B003Y5H57E,"I wouldn't classify this as a comedy in the same way I wouldn't call Spanglish with Adam Sandler a comedy either.  This may be why a lot of people didn't like it.

The movie itself has a lot of real life stuff where the main character Cal (Steve Carell) realizes he is partly to blame for the break up of his marriage - even though she cheated on him with David (Kevin Bacon).  While Cal becomes a protege to Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a womanizer, he really just wants to be with his wife Emily (Julianne Moore).  As he tries to move on, Emily discovers that she kind of misses him too.

The movie is full of plot twists and turns.  I won't say anymore, or it will spoil the movie. Overall, I think the movie would be a great movie to watch on a date night with your significant other or with a girlfriend (since it is a chick flick).  Despite some of the negative reviews I read, I didn't feel like they were justified (unless they were wanting something along the lines of The 40-yr-old Virgin comedy).",1422230400,,1000,4.287234042553192

Read the review: ""Crazy, Stupid Love is arguably evil in its wanton misogyny and low view of women. And it is arguably quite harmful in that its 'insights' about relationships and romance have been given approval by so many adult critics and pundits purely because the lead characters aren't teenagers. ""

I am so sorry I spent $2.99 on this-- it is not worth watching even if it were free. Please save your time and money-- unless you are stupid, you will thank me and the HP

4224776,5,B003Y5H57E,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy with a big heart. That is it is a refreshing change and almost a throwback to a golden era of romance. It's not that the plot is ground-breaking but it is maybe the fact, the appeal of it is that it's all too easy to relate to the characters and the story.

At forty-something,straight-laced Cal Weaver is living a perfect life with the dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his life quickly unravels. Worse, in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of being uncomfortable as a single person. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wing man and protge to handsome, thirty-something player Jacob Palmer.

This is not the ultimate romantic comedy. It is one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction. Also,it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the movies released out there. It gets better and funnier after a labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of most Hollywood comedies. It's the interplay between the characters, the true humanity of their emotions that is long missing from many contemporary romcoms that set this film in a class of its own.",1416960000,,1413,4.693548387096774

4224972,4,B003Y5H57E,"This was a good movie.  My husband saw while we were staying at a hotel.  We missed the beginning of the movie and parts of it during the movie but saw most of it at the end.  It was VERY funny at the end.  We knew we were missing a lot in order to understand a lot of what was going on at the end so we decided we would have to get the movie on Netflix when we got home.  It wasn't available so we bought it on Amazon.com.  It starts out a little slow and drags at times but is a pretty ""cute"" movie.  I have to admit it wasn't as good as what I thought it was going to be after watching the hilarious ending while a the hotel.  It is about a middle aged couple, when the wife asks for a divorce because she has a one-time fling with a co-worker.  All hell breaks from there.  The middle aged man meets a very suave single man who re-makes him so that he then starts having lots of one-night stands.  Meanwhile there is his young son who is crazy about the babysitter who is crazy about the middle-aged man.  Then the suave single man falls in love with a young one who has a surprising ""fit"" into all of this mess.  I know.  This is all very hard to follow but is very entertaining and hilarious in the one scene where it all comes together.

4225289,4,B003Y5H57E,"In real life, love can be messy and irrational, but in the end it's still worth fighting for. At its heart, I believe that is the message that this film tries, and mostly succeeds, at conveying. Romantic comedies have never really been my cup of tea, but few have managed to keep me rapt like this one managed to do. This film was filled with lifelike characters told a compelling, relatable story that, while messy and overstuffed at times, still wrangled the many threads and brought them together in an interesting and completely unexpected way.

 The story is centered around Cal Weaver (Steve Carell, playing his usual schlubb character), whose wife just asked him for a divorce. Completely blindsided by this development, he descends into self-pity, starts frequenting bars and venting out loud to anyone within earshot. This desperation eventually attracts the attention of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a suave ladies' man who helps Cal recapture his manhood and sense of self. This leads to all sorts of misadventures and awkward situations, but where the story ends up is both expected and unexpected at the same time. Rounding out the cast is Julianne Moore as Cal's wife Emily, Kevin Bacon as the man who Emily cheats on her husband with, John Carroll Lynch as a family friend and Emma Stone as Hannah, an up-and-coming lawyer who gets involved with Jacob. Despite having such a large cast, they do end up spending enough time with each character, although the movie's pacing suffers at times and ends up feeling a little disjointed. They all give great, naturalistic performances, even the younger actors. On a more technical note, the film was well-shot, even though comedies tend not to have distinctive filming styles or cinematography. The eclectic soundtrack is also worth mentioning, even though a few cuts were a little too ""on-the-nose.""

 Stepping back a little bit, at first the movie felt like it was trying to accomplish too much. It starts off where a lot of movies start to end, so I thought to myself where it could possibly go from there. The answer is pretty far. It took a rather labored premise and did something fresh with it, and the chemistry and likeability of the cast only made things that much better. My feelings might have been mixed towards the beginning, but as the film progressed I only grew to appreciate it more. Sure, it might not quite live up to its title, but it put forth such a great effort that I have to applaud it for that. It's proof that there is some life in the romantic comedy genre yet. I highly encourage you to see this, if only for the pleasure of seeing its incredible cast at work, but hopefully also for the intimate and honest exploration of love and the human condition.",1406505600,,2739,4.772151898734177

4225397,5,B003Y5H57E,"Intriguing, Heartfelt Storyline In CRAZY STUPID LOVE, With A Surprising Twist To The Plot!!  A Lot More Than What May, At First, Appear To Be Fluff, CRAZY STUPID LOVE Quite Deftly Probes Deeply Into Romantic And Familial Relationships, Rather Than Skimming The Surface.  Superior Cast...All Exellent At Their Craft, Easily Believable In Their Roles With Writers Who Know Just How Far To Go.

I, Myself, Tend To Prefer Steve Carell In Romantic ""Dramadies"" Over Wacky Comedies.  Entire Cast Wonderful!!!  Julianne Moore Is One Of The Best Actresses Over The Past Few Decades.  And, What Female Doesn't Like Ryan Gosling??!!  Handsome Good Looks & Ability...Winning Combination!!!  My First Introduction To The Winsome Emma Stone!! (Who Also Appears With Ryan Gosling In The Film ""Gangster Squad""; Also Well Worth Your Time).  Can't Leave Out Kevin Bacon, Who's Always Up To The Task, Whatever Role He's Playing, Along With Marisa Tomei, Who Has Grown Into A Remarkable Actress!!

CRAZY STUPID LOVE Takes A Fresh Look At All Types Of Intimate Relationships, With Nothing Trite About It.  It's An Emotionally Stirring, Touching Movie, Without Being Saccahrine.  The Comedic Touches Keep That In Check.  Along The Lines Of ""Dan In Real Life"", Also Starring Steve Carell & Also A Hit With Me!!  You Will Find Yourself Laughing & It Will Leave You Smiling With A Lightened Heart...CRAZY STUPID LOVE'S A WINNER!!!",1402704000,,1405,5.15929203539823
4225398,3,B003Y5H57E,"This was a nice date night movie, it was pretty funny and had some good points but all in all it wasn't great. I won't be buying it for my personal collection.",1402531200,,159,4.0
4225399,4,B003Y5H57E,"This film hit the ground running...seriously, we were immersed in its main plot within about twenty seconds.  I'm just fine with that.  It gave us more time to enjoy that, and it was time mostly well spent.  The cast was all great and properly chosen for their respective roles, something that doesn't always happen.  Though I am wondering a few things...does Steve Carell play the middle-aged man whose life is falling apart a bit too convincingly?  Is it weird that Ryan Gosling has just as much chemistry with Steve Carell as he does with Emma Stone?  Seriously, they're all at their best when at least two out of three of them share a scene.  Julianne Moore was great as a woman who was unsure about what she wanted out of life, though I sometimes felt she didn't have enough to do in this film and was just there because the role was needed for the plot.  Same goes for Kevin Bacon, who played the new man in her life.  The opposite goes for Marisa Tomei, playing a school teacher who meets up with Steve Carell's character after his wife leaves him.  She was lively, energetic, and had plenty to do...she just didn't have enough scenes to do it in.  Meanwhile, The interactions between Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton were amusing, though I wonder if any thirteen-year-old boy would be that honest, even to the girl he's majorly crushing on.  Nevertheless, I really liked the ending to their subplot...I'm sure the look on the kid's face was priceless.
  Okay, now as to why, despite my praise for this film, I only gave it four stars.  Well, there are two glaring problems that Hollywood just needs to be made aware of so they can learn from their mistakes.  Number one...while I stand behind my earlier very positive opinion of the entire cast, some of the ways they all come together seem a bit too contrived.  I don't want to give anything away but a suspension of disbelief is required at multiple points in the plot.  Despite that criticism, I did find the multi-confrontational get-together in the backyard very amusing and Ryan Gosling had the best confrontation of them all when he defended Steve Carell.  My second problem is the kid's graduation speech at the end...my problem is so glaring that I want those forty or so seconds of my life back!  It was corny, weird, awkward (that's saying something for this kid), and I just didn't like it or the audience's ultimate reaction.  Also, a huge suspension of disbelief would be required as the school would have surely screened for something like that, especially since it's the 8th grade and considering everything that's already happened with this kid.  From the way he recited the speech, he'd obviously written something down and rehearsed it, so where were the teachers on that one.  His father's part wasn't needed and the audience shouldn't have reacted the way they did.  It should have been done much differently and I still want those forty or so seconds of my life back!  Everything that happened after the speech was just fine.
  But despite those problems, it's still a film worth watching...just go get yourself a candy bar during those forty or so seconds and suspend your disbelief for everything else.  Enjoy.",1402444800,,3190,4.719710669077758
4225400,5,B003Y5H57E,"Not an academy award winner but pretty and pleasant and surprisingly surprising plot twists.  With Steve Carell there is, of course, a little bit of silliness going on but he is funny and there were many more authentic moments than is usually served up in this type of film.  No political preaching and what I consider a pretty happy ending.  Despite the silliness, a comforting film somehow.  I will watch it again and again.",1402358400,,426,4.716216216216216

Ryan Gossling's performance is  outstanding as Cal's ""tutor"" and Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon and Emma Stone also turn in excellant performances.

Altogether they (and the others) bring together a sweet and fun romantic comedy that is enjoyable to watch. The screenwriting is well done and all the little things in terms of plot twists and turns (who is dating who, who said what) are pull together well.

4225750,3,B003Y5H57E,"it's sometimes useful to reduce a film to its basic premises. in ""crazy, stupid love"" the premises are that men are fundamentally little boys, or should be if they are not; women are all indecisive, inept, or inappropriate. all the comedy in this movie is spun from those few principles.

the wife asks for a divorce (indecisively) because she has (ineptly) slept with an office colleague. husband spins into childish despair (loud pity monologs in a bar), then (with infantile naivete) accepts demeaning advice (including face slaps) from a lady's man who is (childishly) acting on erotic impulses. through all this his barely teenage son believes in true love (childishly, and the way a stalker would understand it, as unrelenting harassment until successful possession) while the object of his love, the female babysitter, cannot have what she (inappropriately) wants -- the husband. the wife (indecisively) dates her lover but is (ineptly) ashamed of him in the presence of the babysitter; the lover (childishly) tolerates rebuke from the son. meanwhile the husband's adult age daughter, who has been (ineptly and inappropriately) smitten with a (childishly) vain and shallow lawyer, falls in love (inappropriately) with the lady's man, which causes the lady's man (in a childlike reversal of character) to believe in true love. the unraveling comes in a backyard free for all, launched in part by the babysitter (ineptly) leaving nude pictures of herself, addressed to the husband, where her parents can find them; mending comes in a high school speech where the husband (childishly) celebrates his simplistic emotional universe; the babysitter (inappropriately) gives the son those nude pictures of herself (how did she get them back from her parents?), and the last scene in the film is a cameo of the son, smirking with a knowing look at his parents, who may or may not repair the damage done by the wife's inept indecision and the husband's childlike simplicity.

the three stars are entirely for the enjoyment of watching the performers perform -- even marissa tomei in an otherwise throwaway buffoon role as a high school teacher who (inappropriately) sleeps with a student's father and (ineptly) expects him to call her. carell, gosling and stone work well together, but the teenage son becomes annoying and the other roles (mostly female) are dispensable in their ineptness or indecision. this isn't a smart comedy (the characters are too clueless), and it isn't a dumb comedy (no pie in the face, no clowns with honking noses). it is a congenial comedy, a lite comedy, a canap comedy. if you accept the first principles blithely, and don't mind some implausibly inappropriate, inept or childlike behavior on the part of adults in order to move the plot forward, then you'll probably enjoy it.",1391385600,,2806,5.1244541484716155

However, the crudeness of a teenage girl taking nude pictures of herself for a middle-aged man and then offering a copy to his 13 year old son was really disappointing and  unnecessary!!

But how come Jullian Moore, who cheats on her husband, is made out to be a victim somehow because Steve Carrell sleeps with other women after she leaves him. Like, hello!? You left him. He's free to do whatever he wants. He was perfectly happy to stay married and faithful to you, ya cheatin' whore. You cheated on him with Kevin Bacon and filed for divorces. You have no right whatsoever to act like a whiny victim because he moved on and slept with other people. You broke up the marriage, you deal with it.

Why is Steve Carell the bad guy in that scenario? He didn't have an affair behind his loving spouse's back.

It would have earned 5 stars in my book, if only the final scene between the teenage babysitter and her younger teenage charge (involving a gift of photgraphs) weren't so gag-inducing.

We sometimes get so warped up in our daily routines that we forget what really makes us happy and how in any relationship we should always make time to stop and  rediscover the passion and connection that brought us together.  I love my husband and he is such a good man and I really want to never stop trying to make him happy for he is truly my soulmate and my best friend of 20 years as of July 2, 1994..",1388707200,,515,3.9902912621359223

All centering around seeing how a middle aged man copes with his divorce, which according to his new friend revolves around getting women to go home with him. Using his credit card as if his funds were endless, including a $800+ bar tab for one night. I don't go to bars, so is that even realistic? To much focus on sex. Too much of not enough to keep me interested.

4225965,4,B003Y5H57E,"(Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars, Spoiler Alert) This movie was rare in that I started to lose some hope about midway through, but it recovered in time for a nice finish.  Spoiler Alert! Let's start with some minor negatives.  There are questionable extramarital relationships by both spouses (played by the surprisingly dramatic, and funny, Steve Carell and the always dependable Julianne Moore); whether that was justifiable is up to the viewer.  Also, Oscar winner Marisa Tomei (Supporting Actress, ""My Cousin Vinny"") is good and cute here, but I'm not sure why she'd take such a small, seemingly insignificant supporting role (she's a big enough star to ""carry"" movies in starring roles).  The positives, however, are the rest of the supporting cast, including I-can't-help-it-if-I'm-good-looking-but-I-can-act-too Ryan Gosling, Kevin Bacon (1984's ""Footloose""), and Emma Stone, all representing some of life's complex relationships with appealing performances, with the generally original script also being a strength (at least, it's not the same, tired story you see in most comedy-dramas).  There's also a special surprise for fans of ""Dirty Dancing.""  Recommended and, rest assured, worth your time.",1386201600,,1203,5.6187845303867405

He was so vulnerable and adorable and sexy all wrapped up into one.

Emma Stone is as adorable as always!

I'm not a big reviewer here, but this movie really touched me. It had a few love stories going on at once and each character was so endearing (even Kevin Bacon) that I was rooting for all of them, even though they couldn't all win in the end.",1383955200,,716,4.507692307692308

I told my sisters about it, and we all watched it together, laughing our heads off and relating to the whole thing. (And of course we all murmured a collective ""OOooooo"" when Ryan Gosling took off his shirt!) The dialogue is just clever without trying to be too cute or hip, and both Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling put in a stellar performance. If I had one tiny complaint, it would be that there is a bit too much of the ""babysitter"" plot going on. Perhaps the people who gave this movie negative reviews don't enjoy witty dialogue, fast pacing, sexy abs, and the characters being put in hilariously awkward situations? Maybe they should take their grumpy selves somewhere quiet and read some Nietzsche.",1380499200,,852,4.6118421052631575

There are poignant touching moments as well as classic farce rivaling Blake Edwards at his best.  No matter the size of the role everyone shines in this movie. My wife and I have watched it several times and it never fails to leave us with a smile on our face and in our hearts.

It seems all one has to do in a film anymore is come up with a ""perfect"" ending, and ignore everything that comes before.  Most of the stuff before is about sex, which, in this case for the two lead males, has really nothing to do with love.  Then, at the end, they both discover and rediscover love and that excuses all the irresponsible behavior that comes before.  Sleeping with nine women because you want to get back at your wife is a joke in movie.  In real life, not so funny.  I do realize that some movies are simply meant to entertain, and have no redeeming value.  But this was really dumb.  I think I gave it too many stars.",1377561600,,700,4.156716417910448

The characters are just real and transparent enough to give the movie some substance.  This movie only tries to be what it is, a light movie that let's you laugh at some of the awkward parts of romance and enjoy the parts that work, be those fantasy or reality.",1375747200,,428,4.51948051948052

It's about a lonely depressed man who is so pathetic after his wife leaves him that a stud in his local bar (Gosling) takes pity on him and helps him reinvent himself. There are sub-currents to the characters which are nice. These characters are interspersed throughout the film and it has a really nice reveal about 3/4 thru it

I did NOT enjoy the message to young men and boys that was delivered through Steve Carell's 'son' about persistence (and stalking) being what you need to do in order to 'win' the love of your life - especially if the she in question is totally not on board with the idea. It was creepy and inappropriate.

4226799,4,B003Y5H57E,"As some here have noted, this is almost a great movie.  But it's marred by far too much in the way of crude or simply stupid dialog or events.  The good: most of the interaction between the adults. Cal (Steve Carell) has had only one girlfriend ever (now his wife), whom he met early in high school.  When his marriage hits the skids, Cal has no idea what to do; so he basically hangs out at a bar to drink and complain about his life.  Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a successful bar-scene ""player"" who tells Cal that he wants to help him ""reclaim his manhood"".  Most of the  interaction between Cal and Jacob, as well as their interaction with other adults, is very well done, and if the movie centered exclusively on this it would be worthy of a 5 star rating.  Now there are some parts of the movie where Jacob takes the ""manhood"" thing too far; this straddles the line between humor and poor taste but it doesn't badly harm the movie.  For the most part, the principal actors (Carell, Gosling, Moore, Stone) do an outstanding job; I mainly was interested in this because I enjoy Steve Carell's comic acting, but I must say that Ryan Gosling gives the standout performance here.  The one disappointment among the adults are some of the scenes with Marisa Tomei.  Not her fault, she's great, and still looks fantastic (she's in her late 40's).  But a lot of the lines she's given to say, too vulgar and juvenile for what many would view as a romantic comedy.  It's a shame that her talents are somewhat wasted here.  Kevin Bacon does a decent job, but it's a very small role.

Unfortunately, the film tries to cover more bases than adult bar/dating-scene interaction, and a subplot involving Cal's son and babysitter is almost entirely creepy, vulgar, unrealistic, and is not what I would consider to be humorous.  So when the action moves away from the adults to the teenagers, this becomes a far lesser movie than it could have been.  Which is too bad, because the young actors playing those roles seem very talented, they just have bad material to work with.  There's one scene that Cal's son has with his mother's ""boyfriend"" (Kevin Bacon) that was well done, and a little of his dialog with Cal is fine too.  But other than that, pretty much every time the son does anything it's a cringe-inducing, vulgar embarrassment.  And not at all realistic; the son is supposed to be one of the smartest in his class, yet he's got a creepy, stalkerish obsession with his babysitter, and he freely and proudly states and/or implies all sorts of vulgarities to various authority figures, who do very little to discipline him.  It doesn't help that Cal's son is short and young-looking even for 13, and the object of his affection is quite a tall (17 year old) girl; this only heightens the creepiness quotient, as it looks more like a young boy relentlessly pursuing an adult woman than one teen being interested in another. And as the movie continues, the babysitter even seems to be caught up in some unrealistic, misguided actions herself (mainly involving nude photos, which are not actually seen by the viewer).  So if you have kids, better make sure they either don't watch the movie or else explain to them that these actions are not only unacceptable, but could make them a major embarrassment to their family and community, and in any event would not succeed as intended.

The movie also breaks down toward the end, as perhaps the writer decided to throw in several silly, semi-slapstick, stock plot devices - in order to make this fit the Hollywood ""comedy forumula"".  [MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]. Toward the end we have, in rapid succession: several misunderstandings, a big chase related to the misunderstandings, a bunch of people wanting to do violence to each other (because of the misunderstandings), punches being thrown around, the police arriving on the scene, etc.  Somehow, someone in Hollywood got the idea that violence is funny; it never is, nor should it be.  Then there's the Hollywood cliche' of things going terribly wrong, only to be redeemed by a ""great speech"" that makes everyone stand up and cheer.  Yet it's not a great speech here, not a great message or a great ending.  The speech and ending does not ring true to me (yes I realize it's a movie, but still, there has to be some believability), and only compounds the unrealistic vision of ""romance"" held by Cal's son.

So why four stars?  This is a movie with generous 5 star portions marred by seriously bad/disturbing 1 star elements.  Average those out, and it's a solid 3 star movie.  However, because the good parts here are so strong, I'll assume that the viewer can do their best to ignore the bad parts.  The good parts are definitely worth seeing, so I'm adding a star to the average - to make it 4 stars.  Definitely see this if the main plot interests you, and try to delete the bad parts from your brain as you watch.",1363305600,5,4904,4.638888888888889

both liked how  Carell was funny but yet caring. the blunders seemed to be honest and could almost happen to anyone.

it wasn't too long or too short (their words). they have lent this thing to all kinds of friends.

Even was one of the women and wine night movies.",1361750400,,379,4.295774647887324
4226817,4,B003Y5H57E,"Overall this movie really surprised me, with it's depth of story, romance, and comedy.  I had no idea when I started watching it, that it would turn out to be so good.  Plus they snunk a cute love story in there when I wasn't looking! What was up with that! :)
The story follows a middle aged man, during the crisis and aftermath of his marriage falling apart, and how he picks up the pieces to try and build and new life that includes dating.  He gets hooked by a real ladies man, younger guy, who ends up showing him ""the ropes"" so to speak on how to talk to women, helps him with a make-over, etc.
It was a unique story, that had me totally buying on the homely attitude of the main character.  I felt for him, and wanted to see him get his life back, rise again from the ashes of emotional despair.  And the young ladies man's character, was perfect, just the right amount of honesty and supportive to kick the main character's butt into gear.  Their relationship turns from a mentoring position, to more of friendship, and then back to a mentoring relationship when their roles switch towards the end.
Really good cast, fun and believable characters, cute dialogue that had me laughing, and overall a really good story where you see the character's grow and evolve, with a twist of ending!",1361577600,,1294,4.438818565400844

Crazy Stupid Love feels a little like those ensemble films that came out a while ago [He's Just Not That Into You, Valentine's Day, New Years Eve] that all play off of interesting character relationships and funny revelations about how characters are connected. The film is a great effort with expert casting and is amazingly acted and worth your time, but unfortunately once you see it, I don't know if you'll want to watch it all the time.

And oh yeah Ryan Gosling is super hot as a womanizer and shirtless that alone should make you want to buy the movie. Emma Stone is a great actress and she and Ryan Gosling have great onscreen chemistry which is very obvious since they are starring in another movie together. In this movie every girl wants to be Emma stones character. Sometimes the movie gets slow but don't worry it all makes sense in the end.

4226965,5,B003Y5H57E,"Crazy, Stupid, Love's premise sounds so familiar when I read the synopsis, but it turned out to be one of the funniest and freshest romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Yeah sure,  it's the same old thing, but the clichd old story hasn't been told so witty and revealing since the masterpiece Tootsie!. The perfectly casted ensemble, is pitch perfect here and even though many of the plot twists have been seen time and time again, I have never been so surprised at their revealing!

Carell show's once again he has the acting chops to be both funny and sincere, Gosling one of this generations finest actors gives a fun performance that is both hilarious and endearing. The girls (Moore and Stone) give insightful and believable performances as well.

While so many romantic comedies are considered ""chick flicks"" Crazy, Stupid, Love is entertaining for both men and women.

I own the Blu Ray and found the transfer to be very appealing with no problems. Extras on a film like this are not all that important to me, but I found what was here to be interesting.",1355270400,3,1068,4.664893617021277

Emma Stone on the other hand is 'kinda cute' at best and even her personality in this movie is just 'average' for a typical scattered, clueless, annoying girl with some previous boyfriend PTSD.  She almost derailed this otherwise very funny and smart (for a romantic comedy) movie for me.

Ok now despite my previous point I really enjoyed this movie when I had expected to hate it.  The cast, Emma Stone aside, was excellent, the soundtrack was cool, and the movie was funny and entertaining.

The first time I watched this movie, I was alone at a matinee. And I was so disppointed that I had no one with me to laugh and share the moments! There are things in this movie that hit home with me. I think many men sometimes get to that point in their lives where they stop seeing the use in trying. And sometimes the results aren't pretty. But in this movie, the comedy and the timing are well done. The best parts of the movie are those moments when you aren't really sure what else could go wrong for the main character and then he does something else to show you there's plenty more. And yet, somehow the hope is never completely lost. Emma Stone does an amazing job, as always. I was crying at some points and cheering in others. Without giving away spoilers, I have to say Jonah Bobo steals this film with his chubby pre-adolescent adorkableness! He does a fantastic job with his role. As do the others with more experience under their belts, but this young actor's perfect portrayal of almost inappropriate weirdness really sells his part!

4227004,2,B003Y5H57E,"Somehow the makers of this movie took two of my favorite actors - Julianne Moore and Ryan Gosling - and made them so phony and annoying that I could barely watch; and they magnified all of Steve Carell's most annoying traits so that he was even more obnoxious than usual. I don't think it was supposed to be that way, based on other people's reviews, but that's how it hit me.

I guess Carell fans love anything he does; gasp with amazement any time he manages to cry or to read a line without making a funny face or a funny noise, and tell themselves what a great dramatic actor he is in addition to being the funniest man in the world; and they probably don't care or even notice how anybody else comes across. That's the only way I can account for the vast multitudes who rave about how profound (huh?) this silly, irritating movie is and how phenomenal (awesome, anybody?) Carell is in it. I don't get it, but then I'm obviously not a fan.

And I'm sick of movies that get laughs from pubescent boys getting caught doing what they all do in their rooms any time they're alone and of angst-ridden teenage crushes on older men/women. Those two dumb themes have been done to death.

To summarize this review: this is a stupid, boring, obnoxious and annoying movie that wastes at least two great talents in a stupid, clichd story about stupid, totally obnoxious and unbelievable characters.",1347840000,,1390,4.52988047808765

4227018,4,B003Y5H57E,"The battle of the sexes is over and we won, Ryan Gosling's character, Jacob, tells Cal (Steve Carell from The Office) at the beginning of the serious comedy (and that is an oxymoron, I know) Crazy, Stupid, Love.
Jacob, a cad in his thirties, is quite successful at picking up women at bars and likes it that way.
Forty something years old Cal, on the other hand, is a mess after his wife of 25 years confesses to him of having an affair and asks for a divorce.

When the two meet in a singles bar, Jacob offers unsolicited advice to fashion Cal after Jacob's ideal man (mainly himself).

Twenty something Hannah (Emma Stone) is studying for her bar exam. She is also hoping her boring, self-centered boyfriend will propose to her, to the dismay of her girl friend who worries that if Hannah is content to marry such a loser, what kind of man would she have to settle with? (Because, according to Hollywood, looks is all that matters in the mating game).

At the same time, Cal's fourteen year old son, Robbie, is insanely in love with his babysitter, Jessica, who is seventeen and has a huge crush on Cal. Cal, of course, is totally oblivious to the fact.

So the movie starts.

It gets more complicated as Cal becomes a cad himself and has his pick of women at the bar. One of them will get him in trouble later in one of the implausible plot twists, while Jacob falls for a woman. And Hannah's boyfriend does not propose, and Robbie pursues his love undaunted by multiple rejections and Jessica makes a bold move.

And so the movie goes, with twists and turns unpredictable and not so much, to a final confrontations that worked for me and an epilogue of sorts, Hollywood style, that didn't work at all.

4227019,5,B003Y5H57E,"Warning: Opening scene:

The movie starts out funny. Steve Carrol and his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) are sitting at a restaurant. Steve asks his wife what she wants. She blurts out, "" A divorce."" On the way home Steve jumps out of the car. When they get home, the babysitter asks, ""What happened to you?"" Steve very dryly says, ""Emily said she wanted a divorce and I jumped out of the car."" Meanwhile Emily is discussing with the sitter about her child and broccoli. The sitter had walked in on the 13 year old boy while he was choking his chicken. He in turn tells the babysitter he was thinking of her. This beginning scene had me hooked...then Emma Stone comes on the screen as icing on the cake. 5 star opening scene. Oh and the 17 year old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) has taken a liking to Steve.

Steve does not take the divorce very well. He goes to a bar and pours out his grief to anyone who will listen and sometimes he talks to the thin air. He is taken in under the tutoring of pick-up artist Ryan Gosling who guarantees to make this sad sack into a lady killer. Steve does very well until he opens his mouth. When he talks he makes women want to leave the bar....with Ryan Gosling. Eventually Steve becomes a master Jedi. Kevin Bacon plays David Lindhagen, the ""other man.""

The movie has many laugh out loud moments, great characters and great actors with a wonderful climax scene. From the title you should be able to figure out this is a chick flick.",1344988800,3,1468,4.409594095940959

4227021,3,B003Y5H57E,"Crazy, Stupid, Love starts off on a promising note with several hilarious segments that hold the story together pretty well, but halfway through the comedy falls by the wayside as the romance takes over.  Steve Carell and Julianne Moore play the role of a married couple... for about a minute, and then they get divorced and spend the rest of the movie wondering if they made the right decision.  For a while I was laughing pretty hard- their son finds himself so to speak and tells the babysitter that he was thinking about her while doing it, and a ""relationship"" between the two of them occurs.  The other side story involves Emma Stone having her own romance which is a tacked on, unnecessary and uninteresting waste of movie time.

Seriously, the teenage son having a romance with the babysitter was actually the most interesting part of the movie.  The only other interesting segment involves Steve Carell's character rocking the cradle with a woman he meets at a bar, and when Steve and Julianne Moore's character visit their sons teacher, surprise surprise- the woman from the bar was the teacher!  Keep in mind Steve Carell had no idea she was actually his sons teacher, and Julianne Moore didn't realize the two of them were involved (at least sexually).

Other than the babysitter and the teenage son trying to impress her, I was totally bored with this one.  More romance than comedy is a recipe for failure.  I suppose the babysitter falling for Steve Carell was interesting, but was never developed enough to feel like you're watching an accomplished piece of movie writing.  Alright, I suppose the part when everything came to a head and the men were wrestling and fighting in the yard was good.  This is when the cat is finally out of the bag and the entire family finds out who's been having a relationship/affair with who.  Skip it.",1343865600,,1850,4.746875

4227023,4,B003Y5H57E,"CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is a dynamic and heartfelt comedy--a comedy with real laugh-out-loud moments and scenes where the viewers' heads are nodding because we've all felt the way the characters on screen are feeling.  It's warm, readily identifiable, poignant, substantially charming, and for the most part, totally believable.  It holds together and flows remarkably well--with an hysterical scene when four men go rogue--until it unravels during a surreal and bizarre junior high graduation.  And the air comes out of the balloon with a gaseous hiss, an ending this outstanding comedy doesn't deserve.

Emily and Cal (Julianne Moore and Steve Carell) have been married over twenty years and look and act the part--until Emily announces she wants a divorce, as she's had an affair with a coworker (Kevin Bacon).  Stunned and confused, Cal is suddenly a middle-aged single man, practically wearing the 'D' word on his brow as he attends the local watering hole on a nightly basis, catching the attention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a suave babe magnet who effortlessly picks up any woman he wants, with no strings attached.  Jacob becomes Cal's wing man, teaching him how to dress, how to act, and particularly how to interact.  Although not nearly as successful as Jacob, Cal does periodically ""score"", particularly with perky Kate (Marisa Tomei), who, unbeknownst to both of them, is the teacher of Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo).  Yet despite his conquests Cal feels strangely empty, and still drawn to Emily.  Meanwhile Robbie has a crush on Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the babysitter, and if that's not complicated enough Jessica has a crush on Cal.  And the icing on this neopolitan cake is when ladies' man Jacob falls head over heels for Emily and Cal's elder daughter Hannah (Emma Stone); and the stage is set for some crazy, stupid comedy.

Character actor John Caroll Lynch rounds out the main players as Jessica's father, with Lynch, Bacon, Gosling, and Carell in a tag team foursome that had me donkey braying with glee.  It's all grand fun until Robbie, his eighth grade class valedictorian, gives a grim, existential speech at junior high graduation, with Cal interrupting to wax philosophical on true love, with me squirming uncomfortably, wondering if screenwriter Dan Fogelman had suddenly lapsed into a Jack Daniels funk.  The only persons who might enjoy this scene are therapists, and based on the bizarre utterings there's plenty of work to be done here.  Thus CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is good, often very good, in spite of an almost fatal ending.  I suggest you have some Jack yourself before tackling it.

4227024,1,B003Y5H57E,"I had high expectations for this movie, but it ended up being a major failure. It was also boring. Seeing boring and Steve Carell in the same sentence is not something you see everyday. He has a proven track record of enjoyable movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Over The Hedge, Little Miss Sunshine, Dan In Real Life, Get Smart, Evan Almighty, Horton Hears A Who!, Despicable Me, and Dinner For Schmucks. I was expecting this movie to be on that same level. But it failed to accomplish that. The speech during the graduation by Cal (Carell) seemed forced and awkward. Other than that, Carell's performance wasn't bad. But his best dramedy character is Dan Burns in the movie Dan In Real Life. Julianne Moore's character is easily forgettable. For a memorable Julianne Moore character, check out Freedomland. Emma Stone is also a forgettable character here. Ryan Goseling is the latest one to strike while the iron is hot, being in 3 awful or easy to forget movies that came out in 2011. Those movies being this, Drive, and The Ides Of March. Goseling gets somewhat of a pass because he's in Remember The Titans and I like that movie. I love Marissa Tomei and I was disappointed that her role was a bit part. She's clearly the stand out character of this movie. Kevin Bacon as the romantic antagonist David Lindhagen, is rather light weight. He's not sinister enough in his role. The whole boy and baby sitter subplot was really awkward and creepy. His public displays of love were way over the top, the babysitter's crush on Cal is creepy, the pics the babysitter sends Cal are creepy, and the boy's speech is very unrealistic. And to ask the same question another reviewer asked: why does a 13 year old need a baby sitter? I could see him needing a baby sitter if he were 10. But not at 13. Nothing but a stupid incoherent plot point. The title of this movie is only 1/3 accurate, with that 1/3 being STUPID!",1343001600,4,1914,4.550724637681159

4227047,4,B003Y5H57E,"I remember when the trailer for `Crazy, Stupid, Love' was released and the internet went abuzz because it looked so sweet and charming and adorable and just plain fun.  Then the reviews filtered in, mixed as they were, but general consensus was that the familiarity of the plot and likable nostalgic building of themes was enough to set this film apart and make it feel fresh and new despite recycling thoughts and sentiments from years past.

I feel the same way.

`Crazy, Stupid, Love', despite the obvious influx of sex jokes and promiscuous themes really is from another era.  The way in which the film is developed and the character's fleshed feels oddly nostalgic, as if it is from the golden age of romantic comedies and could have easily starred the likes of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  Instead, we get Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, and they serve as wonderful hosts for Dan Fogelman's story.  Here we have a story of Cal and Emily Weaver.  They have what appears to be a good marriage and nice life until Emily drops a bombshell with the words divorce and affair and Cal's life starts to spin out of control.  Alone and desperate, he is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer, a dedicated Casanova who swoons and lays whoever he pleases and he makes it his mission to turn the uncoordinated and geekish Cal into a middle aged version of himself.  It works, sort of, but Cal cannot shake the idea that Emily is where he belongs.  Trouble also starts to brew for Jacob once he meets Hannah and starts to form feelings that go beyond his shallow bedroom eyes.  In fact, love looms over the entire Weaver clan as young Robbie tries his hand at wooing his babysitter who happens to be harboring a crush on Cal.

It's complicated.

With inspired performances by Carell, Moore, Gosling and Stone not to mention a slew of memorable supporting performances by Marisa Tomei and America's Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, `Crazy, Stupid, Love' is sharp, funny and charming.  It isn't perfect, but what film is these days (actually, there are a few).  The jokes don't always work and there were some moments where it felt like it was either trying too hard, or not trying hard enough.  Alas, when it hits those marks, it hits them just right.  This isn't a particularly smart film, for the silliness of a lot of the scenes is what makes is so endearing, but then again, when is love ever anything but stupid?",1342483200,3,2417,4.622950819672131

The kids' love story is the worst and the babysitter's part where she's obsessed with the ancient Steve Carell is plain creepy. I get what the screenwriter was trying for but it still came across as weird especially as the babysitter overplayed the awkward teen persona.

The movie is also completely disjointed. It seems the edits from scene to scene at times are completely abrupt.
Plus, sorry, but Kevin's Bacon and Julianne Fries Moore just did zip for me in this. They just seemed to be acting as if they were comatose.
Also, Marisa ""the screaming banshee"" Tomei makes a gratuitous appearance that adds nothing but the audience wondering why she gets movie roles given her acting range consisting of looking at things with those deer in headlight eyes and shrieking.

It is beyond contrived and has a VERY large ""Ick"" factor, regarding a barely-teenaged boy and his older teenaged babysitter.  Ugh.

Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling appear to be acting in 2 different movies.  Carell reprises his Michael Scott role from ""The Office"" (as always) and Gosling is channeling a 1950's Frank Sinatra. We never know why Gosling's character would have even addressed Carell's in the bar--other than to tell him to shut up.  Why would he invest his time trying to make this douche into a ""player""? Julianne Moore's character is whiny and immature.  But she's right at home with the rest of this crew.  The most mature person in the movie is the 13-year-old puppet who is spouting words of wisdom that would require more perspective than any teenager has. (""You have to fight for her, Dad!"") He is completely unconcerned--and addresses the issue--when the babysitter walks in on him at an inopportune moment.  The final scene between these two is completely unbelievable--right out of the fantasy of someone incarcerated for a sex crime.

""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" takes us down the rabbit hole along with Cal (Steve Carrell) a man married for over twenty years who finds his ""perfect"" marriage fraying at the edges when his wife (Juliana Moore)takes up with one of her co-workers (Kevin Bacon)telling Cal she wants a divorce. Cal suddenly single and clueless turns to a ladykiller named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who enables him to become like him. Jacob, in turn, doesn't know that HE is truly looking for something of what Cal HAD in his marriage until he meets Hannah (Emma Stone)who also seems adrift in her own relationship. Throw in a teenage babysitter(Annaleigh Tipton) who has a crush on Cal, Cal's son (Jonah Bobo) who has a crush on the babysitter and you have the receipe for a series of mad, intersecting romantic triangles.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" focuses on the quest for true love and how we can be led astray by our own misleading impulses. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is one of those rare, intelligent and genuinely funny comedies that also manages to be surprising and (at least in my opinion) honest.

The script by Dan Fogelman (""Tangled"")is enhanced by marvelous performances by a top notch cast and sharp direction by Glenn Ficarra (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") and John Requa (""Bad Santa"").

The image quality for the DVD is very good with a nice, crisp, colorful presentation.

The special features on the DVD are somewhat limited (especially compared to the Blu-ray)including deleted scenes, an alternate ending as well as a scene where Steve Carell and Moore attempt the ""Dirty Dancing"" lift (it plays a part in the movie, too).

The blu-ray, on the other hand although it also has slim pickings when it comes to the special features, has more including two featurettes ""Steve and Ryan Walk Into a Bar"" and ""The Player Meets His Match"".",1341100800,,1837,4.853035143769968

4227075,1,B003Y5H57E,"This was on HBO, rated three stars, so I thought I'd watch. Who ranks these? Where do I start?

First the dialog. Completely unbelievable. None of it sounded real. Zero. I'm also getting really tired of seeing middle-school aged children be the wise soothsayers, making all the adults nod sagely. I was creeped out by the borderline unnerving stalking of the son character of the babysitter, and the similarly creepy (and completely unbelievable) stalking her character did of the father. The single-mindedness the son had about the babysitter was entirely ridiculous. Doesn't the kid own an X-box?? Thirteen year old boys have the attention spans of gnats, and I would be a little weirded out if I was an adult around a kid who was that obsessed. The youngest daughter was a paper-thin throwaway character, mindlessly flitting around the movie, dancing like an autistic mental patient in her dad's new apartment, after her parent's marital separation. Oh, how funny! I'm surprised they didn't put her in an omnipresent tutu to really hammer home just how unaffected and breezy she is about--let me repeat it--her parent's marital separation. Was anyone else skeeved out seeing Steve Carell trying to get his groove on at a lounge catering to twenty-somethings, aka his daughter's age? Maybe this is commonplace in LA, but in the rest of the country, there's something really gross about it as well as tired. Barring the baffling attraction the rest of the country has for Ryan Gosling, as well as the boring one-note Emma Stone (who basically plays the same character over and over and over and over), I guess no other women who frequent the only bar apparently in town had any personality whatsoever. Kevin Bacon was supposed to be a reviled character, but I was like ""thank God, someone interesting"" every time he came onscreen.

Melissa Tome has a ridiculous role, way beneath her. How did anyone get these good actors to make this film?
The script is uneven at best. The best scenes are with Gosling; he lights up the screen. The climax of the movie is embarrassing, so hokey, Steve Carrell delivers a speech, literally, about love to a gymnasium filled with high school kids and their parents.

Steve Carell definitely does the ""cuckhold"" husband part well with this super uncomfortably awkward moments back into the dating scene, and his genuine believability as a decent husband and even better father. Julianne Moore was outshined fairly well by the entire cast, lol, even the son. Ryan Gosling could NOT have played his part better. In fact I wish there had been more of him in the film, he was fantastic as the ""Hot Guy Who Hit on Me at the Bar."" He played the player with such elegance and finesse that you were on his side the entire time. Not to mention he obviously had a sweet side to take Steve Carell's character under his wing and show him the playboy ropes, if you will, even if just for a short time. The movie was funny, sappy, heartwarming, the whole 9 yards. Don't expect unending laughter because it is more like ""Dan in Real Life"" or ""The Story of Us"" that just incorporate more of a realistic tone into the scope of things.

He befriends Cal Weaver (Steve) and becomes a mentor, of sorts, to his newly separated friend, and shows him how to manuever through the single man's world.  Emmy Stone comes into the movie (in her best comedic performance to date), as a woman who sets Jacob's world on it's ear.  They had such great chemistry; it really comes across on screen and makes the movie that much more enjoyable.

4227194,4,B003Y5H57E,"It appears that Ryan Gosling is going to take over the world - or at least your living room - because the guy is 'everywhere'. And like Bradley Cooper about six months ago - everyone wants Ryan. And I mean everyone. And on the strength of ""Drive"", ""The Ides Of March"" and this - it's easy to see why. Women are drooling over him - and guys want to be his drinking buddy.

Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling play Cal Weaver and Jacob Palmer - two polar-opposites in the cool stakes. Cal has only ever had one woman and wife - the beautiful but slightly wayward Emily (Julianne Moore). Jacob has had more women in an hour that politicians have had billable brunches. His prey is sophisticated but loose business types that frequent the bar Jacob hangs out in - women with the corporate finesse of a piranha that hasn't eaten in a week. When Cal stumbles into an ill-advised divorce because of one mistake on the part of Emily - he enters Jacob's world - and with advice that appeals to a man's ego - enters into way too many easy lays. His journey back to his true love makes up the rest of the movie...

Clearly relishing the witty and smartly written script  - the two wildly different male leads spar off each other very convincingly. Julianne Moore is her usual classy self as always (such a great actress). There's even a tremendously clever and funny pairing of young love in the 13-year old Robbie (Cal's son) who is besotted with his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (great work by both Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton). On the bumbling adult front - Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei bump up the cringe and laugh count too.

But for me it's the fabulous Emma Stone who brings the whole macho proceedings to life - and like her breakthrough performance in ""Easy A"" - she injects some badly needed reality into the picture. Her character's bubbly nature is infectious and her palatable vulnerability fills her love scenes with Gosling with a sense of danger and thrill. Stone's Hannah wants her heart fulfilled - not used - not shattered by some smarmy barfly out to chalk up another notch on the headboard of his waterbed. Stone's Hannah is nervous, giddy, talkative, loving, trusting - she gives Hannah a 'this-is-how-a-real-woman-is' set of reactions - and the movie is so much the better for it - warm even.

""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not pretending to be ""War And Peace"" - but it's a hugely enjoyable romp when those sort of things seem to be in short supply these days. Besides - it passed the ultimate litmus test - my missus and teenage daughter gobbled up every moment of it and could not be tempted away - even by morsels of Cadbury's Twirl...

Do my girls want to discover the true meaning of love? Find out the joys of marital bliss? Bath in the wisdom of enlightened relationships? Do they bo**ox! They want to lick strawberry Haagen Daz off the Gozzer's rippling abs and YouTube the experience afterwards to make all their friends jealous. It's enough to make me go back to the gym (well now - let's not be too hasty my dears...).

In fact - now that I think of it - forget the review. Can somebody please slip some soluble ugly tablets into Ryan Gosling's Spritzer...and do all of us mere mortals a favour!

Guys don't usually change their bad boy ways that quickly! Steve Carell wasn't very relatable as well. Marisa Tomei tries too hard to be outrageous, it just comes off as bad acting.

He is befriended by a young mentor ( Ryan Gosling) who is determined to teach him a thing or two about becoming a ladies man. In a way, this film could have been very cliched but it survives on the chemistry of the two leads, Gosling and Carrell.

Indeed the humor involving  Moore's character or any of the teenagers falls flat.

Gosling does a surprisingly great job fleshing out what is essentially a stereotype of a gigolo.  And Steve Carrel is also good -- though he's already done this exact role 5 times before

Enter a player (played by Ryan Gosling of THE NOTEBOOK) at a club the husband attends who takes pity on him and teaches him how to get it on with attractive women. There are clearly some good laughs in this film but it has a lot to say about not only gender roles but also how the genders treat each other in the courtship/mating phases. There's clearly a theme running through this film that the man has to toil to make the woman happy and that sometimes he'll be happy as well and other times he will not. It would also seem that if a single man cheats with a married woman that it's okay to punch said single guy but not the married woman who had a vow going yet she's a woman so you can't do that. A true love theme also permeates the movie but what puts this film up a few notches in comparison to other romantic comedies are the overlapping subplots. The player falls in love near the end of the picture, the 13 year old son is already in love with the babysitter but she loves somebody else and, well, you get the idea. Women will love the ""dance"" scene with Gosling and Stone. Supporing roles by Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone and John Carroll Lynch (Norm from FARGO).  The ending sort of dumbed itself down to what people wanted to hear and detracted from some of the unanswered questions of love and how it sometimes makes us do stupid things and also how people who love each other in a marriage don't always work things out. Anyway, the sappy ending detracted from the overall tale and sold out. If not for that the story part of the film would have been higher. The budget for this film was roughly $50M and it made over $142M at the Box Office.

The story centers around a series of characters at different stages in their lives, but all are looking for the same thing: someone to love and be loved by.

This is Stevel Carell at his best.  We all know he can be funny from his Daily Show roots, but my favorite Steve Carell is when his humor shines through a performance of deeper meaning.  This is that movie.  If you enjoyed him in the movie Dan in Real Life, this is the same Steve.  The Steve that is so honest you laugh and cry all at once.

Emma Stone also has a notable performance.  I haven't loved all of her most recent work but this performance is true to her roots.  Quirky but definitely showing a sexy side.

And whoa, where has Ryan Gosling been all my life?  He very convincingly played the ladies man - the guy who plays every moment so well, but you just don't care because he is just yummy.  Definitely A+ eye candy.

The script and story are what truly makes the film special.  It has the thoughtful composition of Magnolia, it depicts a slightly darker more ""R rated"" suburbia reminiscent of American Beauty, and the dialogue is sharp and witty.

One can watch Gosling and tell that if he continues to take the roles he does, he's going to be a great actor with a great career.

Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is dedicated to the pursuit of one-night stands with beautiful women. And Hannah (Emma Stone) is a soon-to-be lawyer in love with a man who her best friend believes is beneath her but who Hannah (Stone) is genuinely hoping will propose. But Weaver (Carrell) is blindsided when his wife of more than 20 years, (played by Julianne Moore) confesses she's been unfaithful and wants a divorce.

  We soon find Cal Weaver living in an apartment spending an inordinate amount of time at a local pickup joint drinking heavily and repeatedly stating the particulars of his wife's infidelity to the establishment's clientele. This puts a serious crimp in Jacob's evening and so he offers his advice and services as a life coach, of sorts. Meanwhile, he's made several overtures to Hannah only to be rejected every time.

  I'll admit, there are few moments where the characters find themselves in situations so embarrassing, that I can't bear to watch. That said, this is easily the best comedy I've seen this summer, and perhaps this year. Good premise, great characters, and amazing twists you do not see coming.

4227264,5,B003Y5H57E,"Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver, who has just discovered his wife Emily of twenty odd years (played by Julianne Moore) has been cheating on him with a smarmy co-worker played by Kevin Bacon.  The couple has two children living at home, sometimes minded by cute babysitter Jessica (played by Analeigh Tipton,) who has an unrequited crush on Cal. Cal and Emily's thirteen year-old son Robbie (Johan Bobo), in turn, has an unrequited crush on older woman (four years older, to be exact) Jessica.

The most difficult circumstance of this breakup, at least from my point of view, is that fact that Cal and Emily have been together since the tender age of fifteen--making the now ousted Cal seem incredibly vulnerable and helpless now that he is out on his own for the first time in his life.  Without any experience in meeting women beyond having asked young Emily out for an ice cream cone twenty some years ago, poor Cal is completely adrift without a clue where to begin this new phase of his personal life.  An unlikely Good Samaritan comes to his aid, however, in the person of Ryan Gosling's Jacob, a lady's man who takes it upon himself to remake Cal in his own image.  With Jacob's help, Cal soon finds himself bedding one babe after another, including a woman (played by the always appealing Marisa Tomei) who he later (and embarrassingly) discovers to be his son's teacher!

The various love polygons left in the wake of Cal's newfound persona and romantic conquests adds to the dilemma that he still loves his estranged wife and would dearly wish to return to his pre-breakup life--as evidenced by the secret nocturnal gardening that he indulges in around his old house.  Complications duly ensue that complicate this quest, leaving the viewer wondering, like Cal, how life's complex problems can ever be sorted out!",1326326400,3,1820,4.814102564102564

The writing is sharp, and the cast is excellent. It centers around Julianne Moore and Steve Carroll as a long-married couple for whom the flame has died. She has a brief affair and asks for a divorce, and this plunges Carroll's character (Cal) into his own search for a new persona. Ryan Gosling is fantastic as a younger womanizer who tutors Steve Carroll in seduction, but then is himself changed by a relationship with Emma Stone's character.

The movie is somewhat predictable, although it does have some twists that surprised me. It gets a little cliche in the way it resolves everything in the end, but I didn't mind that because the by then I was invested in the characters. I think the standout here is Ryan Gosling who is believable, touching, and sexy in his role. A good couple's movie!",1326240000,2,965,4.676470588235294

Going into it I thought 2 hours would take forever to arrive, but this movie was so fast paced it felt like it was done way too soon.  Steve Carell was amazing.  He plays the typical WASP suburbanite perfectly.  He was that guy that most men in America have turned into.  They get up, go to work, wear clothes that suck, don't ever have sex with their wife b/c they bore her, etc,.  He ends up moving out after his wife asks for a divorce, and hits the bar scene pretty hard to drink away his woes.  There, he runs into Ryan Gosling who plays a ""Super Stud"" bedding women left and right, who then takes Steve's character under his wing.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this movie accompanied with a lot of unexpected funny moments.

4227279,4,B003Y5H57E,"I just finished watching this movie a few minutes ago. I had been putting off watching it for quite sometime, fearing it would not be good. But, Marisa Tomei is in the film, (in a supporting role).. I like her a lot.. I have since the '80's when she was on the tv show ""A Different World."" Also, in previous films, Emma Stone has been charming, and Steve Carell is funny at least some of the time.. so finally I gave in and watched this movie.

Yes, there have been other films before with a suave younger guy helping a hapless older guy.. or something like that. I was concerned this would be entirely formulaic and so forth, but it was better than I'd hoped.

The casting and acting were rather good, and the story had enough little turns in it and fun moments to stay interesting. The cast worked well together, and there were many likeable people in this film. Julianne Moore is one of my least favorite actresses, but even she did fairly well.

The kids were great, especially Analeigh Tipton as Jessica, the babysitter, and Jonah Bobo, who played Robbie Weaver, son of Cal Weaver (Carell's character). They both played their roles with a lot of heart, and Bobo was quite funny.

I liked how the film showed that young people, even though they are young, can have very strong emotions and deep thoughts about life, and that they should be taken seriously. I remember how things felt when I was 13 (which was a looong time ago), and I am glad this film delved into the emotional lives of teens in an honest way.

The movie was also good about showing what an utter mess and ruin infidelity and divorce can cause. And that the hook-up culture and lifestyle can leave people feeling empty. This movie came out with a strong message about the importance of family, and genuine love.

Even the music was good. I'm going to try to purchase several songs from the soundtrack. Right now, at the time I am writing this review, here on Amazon, all the mp3's are listed as ""album only,"" so what I am going to do is try to track down some of these songs on other legitimate pay-per-song download sites (if a song is worth listening to, it is worth paying for).. some of the songs may have been previously released on earlier albums by the various artists. Some of these songs might already be found in the Amazon mp3 store, as part of other albums. This happens sometimes. Also, as is usually the case with most movies, some of the songs in this film are not on the soundtrack. But, if you do some looking online, you'll be able to find a complete list. I typed in ""all the songs from crazy stupid love"" into google, and found a list.

Anyway.. Not a family film.. some of the parts were pretty strong for a PG-13 movie, so I suggest not watching this with the kids..

But.. overall a good movie, worth watching, and I am glad I rented it.",1325980800,2,2832,4.401529636711281

It brings the romantic comedy to a mature and modern age with wit, heartfelt humor and characters that are believable and superbly cast.  Steve Carell and Julianne Moore are excellent as a married couple on the rocks.  Marisa Tomei pops in with a role that makes one remember how talented she really is.  But for me the true strength and heart of the film comes from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  Ryan Gosling gives a highly entertaining comedic performance that is so multi-dimensional it will certainly take viewers by surprise as his character goes through many changes.  And Emma Stone is also hilarious.  She is proving herself to be an added asset to any film and here her humor is performed with a new intelligence and maturity.  The film is 2 hours and the beauty and heart of the film unfolds slowly from the rather abrupt beginning to the poignant and superb ending.  This is a film for true romantics.  The laughs here come from identifying with the characters and their lives.  Many subplots blend together in perfect harmony.

The blu ray presentation is quite remarkable.  The video is spot on with a clarity that truly pops.  Colors are vibrant and bright with flesh tones realistic and true.  The black/white ratio is excellent and the overall crispness of the picture is that one may not expect from a romantic comedy.  And the audio matches it.  Dialogue is strong and present with the surround speakers used perfectly for ambience and club scenes.  The overall presentation is a perfect example of blu ray at its best.

I honestly loved this film.  I did not see it in the theater and after purchasing it here at Amazon have watched it 3 times already and each time it makes me laugh more while also touching me more with its heartfelt and realistic message.  And with each viewing I am struck again by how great Ryan Gosling is here.  Who knew he had such great comedic chops.  Add to that his always superb character development and it becomes one of his best roles so far.  Highly recommend this film.

Usually, it's the man dumping the wife because of his illicit affair or need to look elsewhere.  Why she strayed to begin with isn't delved into deeply.  You sort of never see it coming either, just like the husband, Cal.

However, shocked and broken over the revelation, he heads to the bar he's passed many times and bemoans his unfaithful wife who wants a divorce.  He meets the womanizing man, who is going to turn him into a man his wife will want back.  The tables are turned.  He's the one who has let himself go, and suddenly he's turned into a well-dressed dude ready and able to woo the women in the bar like his teacher.

Of course, he still loves his wife, who struggles with her decision.  One child goes through struggles of adolescence and divorce, while the other dances through apparently unscathed.  And a side story brews over another young girl, who surprisingly is related to Cal in a level you've never guessed.

The theme of soul mates and fighting for love seem cliche in this day and age.  It's a notion that has passed on by, as well as fighting for a marriage on the brink of divorce.  If we were all truly soul mates, would we fight to keep it together?  If you haven't married your soul mate, is your marriage doomed?  The theme is idealistic; but reality is much different.

A few laughs are here and there.  A lot of sap is in the message.  It was a mildly entertaining, but irritating as well if you've suffered through adultery, divorce, and themes that are contrary to the movie's message.  Let's be honest.  Life doesn't always turn out like a movie's happy ending.",1325116800,,1992,4.487465181058496

4227303,3,B003Y5H57E,"At first glance I thought this was going to be another Hitch movie - man can't get girl so ""Rico Suave"" comes along and teaches geek/nerd to be a lady's man.

Boy was I wrong.

Steve Carell plays Cal, a man whose wife has just told him she wants a divorce and that she slept with another man.

In his depressed stupor, Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) a lady's man who goes home with a different girl every night. Jacob makes it his mission to get Cal back in the dating scene.

Meanwhile, there's a girl who brings out a new side of Jacob that makes him awkward. He begins to feel like he's in a real relationship.

Carell saves this movie as he does with every film he's in. There are some truly awesome comedy moments in this game, but they are always marred by taking the crude humor/language too far.

A case-in-point is at the cliched ""speech"" moment at the end of the film. It could have ended with the cheese but the son just has to add one more sentence which pretty much ruined it.

This is not exactly a romantic comedy in the traditional sense. Yes, it deals with the foibles of romance and fleeting love but it also touches on some darker aspects of married love that looks to have failed.

I was surprised with the twist in this film. It was great and created a wonderful collision mid-climax for an awkward-paced movie.

Steve Carell seems to be a fantastic actor who gets cast in some crude movies.",1325116800,8,1412,4.338403041825095

I was thinking that because Evan Almighty and Get Smart the most recent Steve Carell movies that I can think of that isn't The Office (I know a tv show) or 40 Year Old Virgin was terrible.  I LOVE The Office, and thought he played Michael Scott amazing and the lines in 40 Year Old Virgin still make me laugh no matter how many times I can watch it. However, this movie is now one of my favorite movies. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling friendship is what makes this story so funny. As their relationship progresses when Ryan Gosling's character helps Steve get his ""manhood"" back after his wife cheats on him and ask for a divorce. It makes the events that unfold at the end so much better. They are the perfect duo for this movie. However, I have seen Drive this year too and Ryan Gosling really can't do any wrong with films lately! Emma Stone is in the movie too. She must have had some of the best one liners in this movie. She delivered them so well that they were believable and hilarious. I love Steve Carells son's character in the movie too and what 13 year old isn't in love with their gorgeous 17 year old baby sitter. They are at that age. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Julianne Moore as the wife. She didn't seem to me to be as well at comedic roles as the others. She did have the P-zaz that I thought she would. She was believable but she just didn't do it for me. I could picture other actresses instead. So with that being said I really can't express how much I loved this movie. I wish I could remember the characters names better but I was never good with that unless I watched a movie 20x and that hasn't happened YET.",1325116800,,1763,4.215976331360947

True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love--and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his ""soulmate"" and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway--except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know--and ""click"" with--another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place.

4227340,2,B003Y5H57E,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is billed as a romantic comedy but ends up much more as a sentimental romance. The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.

  After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.

  Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?

  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.

  While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.

  Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film--and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.

  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending.

Both movies are smarter than most comedies and say a lot about family dynamics. Both are also flawed in a lot of little ways that lessen your enjoyment. So much in ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is funny and entertaining, particularly the Carrell and Gosling scenes and the Gosling and Emma Stone scenes. Where it doesn't always work is with the babysitter and Carrell's son who is 13 to her 17. After a film that's heavy on realism, the babysitter does something not only illegal but also unlikely at the end of the film that felt like something you'd find in a regular ""American Pie"" movie instead of the decent one they'd created here.

The casting for this movie is superb. The plot is realistic. The screenplay is smart. I laughed a lot. I cried a little. I loved all the characters.

this review is about the false advertising that came with the movie.  the advertising says digital copy but this is not the digital copy that we are used to that is a stand alone copy that can be installed into iTunes and played on any of the compatible players.  it is rather the new and useless ""ultraviolet"" version that the studios are pushing.  to use this you need to sign up on the studio web site.  yes you are going to be asked to give your name, birthday and email to yet another spam generator.  you are going to be asked to do this by every studio that pushes this format.  might not be entirely bad if it actually produced a digital copy that works like ALL the other digital copies before it, i.e. easily installed into iTunes.  But it does not.  worse than that it requires multiple steps to even get it on your device, you have to install new software and then you have an internet connection.  what a waste.

If it's not written and filmed in NY then the only other spawning ground, in all the filming locations of the world, for a bar-hopping, rom-com, chick flick would be LA. So, if a viewer finds the script and storyline humorous then they're in the marketable demographic that's stuck (and studios are honed into) in the same fantasy rut as our actors.

He's the jilted husband unsure of what went wrong. Enter sexy hunk and notorious lady man Ryan Gosling who offers to teach his older friend the ways of the world. Gosling's character is an over the top, somewhat sleazy, ladies man who spends his evenings in the bars picking up woman. It's not hard to guess who he ends up with.

There are a few gems here: Ryan Gosling is perfect as a cool narcissist with a thin veneer covering a vulnerable human being and there is a genuinely touching scene with his new found love when he begins to open that shell.

Marisa Tomei is just over the top one-step-away-from-Fatal-Attraction-but-funny.  Liza Lapira is fantastic but under-utilized as the candid and raunchy-mouthed friend of Hannah, the soon-to-be attorney.

The side plots are kind of Malcolm in the Middle uncomfortable, Cal's son having a meant-to-be-funny but kind of disturbing obsession with his babysitter, the babysitter having an equally disturbing obsession with Cal. And did I mention that an affable KEVIN BACON is in the movie for no particular reason I think except that it's another way to tie Kevin Bacon to everything in the universe.

Bottom line, this is a movie that is meant to be funny, but doesn't ring true for the main plot (true love between Cal and his wife) and with a number of itchy subplots that are just shy of having the police and a SWAT team of psychologists being called in to take the characters away.  That being said, there are Great, and I mean Really Great performances by Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei and Liza Lapira.  See it, but it's a mixture of laughs and ""eeuuws""",1323216000,7,1551,4.739776951672862

While this has all of that, there was much less of the squirming moments --- there were a lot of moments that could have been but the plot set up for them so well, you could understand why they went there and was not awkward or forced so you asked ""why are they doing this? Is it just for lame laughs?""--- and a mercifully shorter downturn at the end than other comedies.  The plot managed to surprise me at times and made me laugh a lot more at the just plain funny moments than I had in a long time with a movie.

While I could understand Julianne's character being conflicted and facing a mid-life crisis, at the same time, she was hard to like since wishy-washy is just plain hard to sympathise with no matter how justified.  The romance of the film was largely Steve and Ryan's characters' bro-mance and helped carry a story where romantic love has been shown to be an uncertain thing.

I'll admit, we only watched about half of the movie before we turned it off. I'm sure the movie ended fine with everyone finding a stable relationship, but up to the point I watched, I didn't like the message. And that message was that it's cool and all right to be a player.

Let's not mention the disturbing crush the babysitter has on Steve Carrell's character and the disturbing position the babysitter finds the son of Steve Carrell's character. Both deal with minor children and it made me uncomfortable.

The worst part comes later in the movie when the teenage babysitter develops a crush on Carrell's character. I suppose the filmmakers thought this was funny, but I don't find it remotely humorous when an underage character sends nude photos to a grown man. It's not even believable, because let's face it, Carrell is a minus ten in looks.

On the bright side, Gosling did a great job in the secondary romance. Too bad the main story was awful. I highly recommend viewers skip this if they are sensitive to issues dealing with inappropriate relationships with minors.",1322265600,12,911,4.69375

4227556,2,B003Y5H57E,"I confess that I'm not much of a Steve Carell fan, but I approached this film with higher expectations because of the overall cast and the generally upbeat reviews. A romantic comedy that is virtually laugh-free,  about a dull, straight-laced man (Carell) who, faced with divorce from his neglected wife (Juianne Moore) hooks up with a successful swinger (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to pick up women in a local bar. And that is the sum and substance of the film, which after over an hour of tedium and unconvincing situations, we suddenly have a deeply felt scene between the amazing Ryan Gosling and the equally interesting Emma Stone that seems to have wandered in from another film. Sadly, the feeling doesn't last, and the film loses its footing very quickly. There are several other subplots, and they all collide during the very frantic, not very funny penultimate scene, followed by a finale that features Carell and is squirm-inducing.
For the record I had rented this film, and was so depressed when it was over, I watched ""The Americanization of Emily,"" the 1964 satire with the wonderful pairing of James Garner and Julie Andrews, written by the brilliant Paddy Chayefsky, and once again found it funny, touching and altogether brilliant...in other words, all the things that ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not.",1321056000,6,1323,4.95945945945946

This was a pretty good movie, nice twist for a romantic comedy, some more updated dialog than many of the films in this genre. It may also be comfortable watching as a couple or a first date, as there is a sub-plot that seems tailor made for guys. It had its issues with the script after the surprise toward the late middle. But it gets back on its feet and gives us a pretty good ending. It's also a bit cross-generational. I'm turning 40 soon and I'd be comfortable watching this with my younger cousins in their 20s.",1321056000,,679,4.223076923076923
4227559,1,B003Y5H57E,"This movie features a stellar cast of accomplished actors, but I found it incredibly disappointing. The script is terrible, and there is a whole sub-plot involving a character's son that should have been deleted. And the ending reminded me of an ABC After School Special: Groan-worthy; the kid standing at the podium in the school gym, and dear-old-dad grabs the mike and starts blithering on about how much he loves his wife. Hollywood loves the public display of emotion, as if it somehow holds more weight becuase there is an audience.
The problem is this film doesn't know what it wants to be: if it's a fantasy/comedy, then it should not try to pull at your heartstrings at the same time. That would require a decent script and a certain amount of realism. Divorces are not done in 1 day, there are issues around money/custody, etc. that need to be worked out, etc. That none of this happens - instead, we see the supposedly brokenhearted husband hanging out in the bar - made me not care about the characters. It is just a silly plot; middle-aged man receives dating advice from super-cool younger guy. Husband works in an office cubicle but somehow makes enough money to buy a massively expensive new wardrobe and pay for bar tabs that amount to $800. It was just dumb, not believable at all. And I cannot understand why Marisa Tomei would agree to take on a puny role, portraying a ridiculous, hysterical school teacher. Kevin Bacon is also wasted here. In fact, all the actors are wasted here. The best performance was by Emma Stone; she was the only reason to watch this dud til the very end.",1321056000,28,1602,4.644366197183099

Soon, however, Jacob himself begins to earnestly fall for Hannah, and both he and Cal must lean on each other for support through their tumultuous love lives. With a supporting cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, Crazy, Stupid, Love. charmed me, it's unabashedly sweet even if it doesn't quite live up to the ""crazy"" part of its title.

4227564,4,B003Y5H57E,"Crushed upon learning that his wife of many years has cheated on him, 44 year old Cal (Steve Carell) immediately moves out of their house.  At this point, Cal isn't really interested in why Emily (Julianne Moore) cheated.  After all, they've been together since middle school and have never been with anyone else.  Cal decides to get back out there (there being where he's never been) and bumps into Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a playa' of the first magnitude.  Jacob agrees to coach Cal and eventually he has some success.  But Cal is never comfortable in the role of seducer-in-chief.  He's still in love with his wife.

This is only one relationship interwoven in this nice romantic dramedy.  Jacob, not looking for anything other than nooky, finds a girl (Emma Stone) who 'can' resist him.  Naturally, he's more interested.  Then we have Cal and Emily's 13 year old son who has a major crush on his 17 year old babysitter, who in turn has a crush on Cal.  And of course there's Emily trying to figure out if there's anything of value between her and her work romance with David (Kevin Bacon) other than ""banging"" (Cal's favorite word).

What appears to be complicated, in reality comes across very clear as the film unwinds. The directors (Glenn Ficarra, John Requa) do a good job walking the fine line between raunchy comedy, heartfelt romance and eventually a true love story.  It is also a rare movie that has a twist at the end that caught me by surprise.

4227577,5,B003Y5H57E,"Brief Overview:

Cal Weaver (Carell) has the perfect life, good job, nice house, great kids and is married to his high school sweetheart and then he learns his wife cheated on him with a co-worker and wants a divorce. Now his life's been turned upside down and he has a lot to learn about being single, dating, women and style. Weaver begins frequenting a bar night after night talking about his divorce until he's noticed by Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and their friendship develops. Palmer's a womanizer and takes Cal under his wing teaching him how to seduce women, how to dress and what to drink.

Cal and Emily aren't the only ones looking for love in what might be all the wrong places: Cal's 13-year-old son, Robbie (Bobo), is in love with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica (Tipton), who harbors a major crush of her own... on Cal. And even Jacob's game is challenged when he tries his best lines on Hannah (Stone), a girl he just can't seem to get out of his mind, maybe because she's the first woman he's ever met not impressed with his advances.

My boyfriend and I watched this movie last night and I have to say, its one of the few movies that we BOTH actually laughed out loud in.  Several times. We love Steve Carell and expected hilarity from him, but I was pleasantly surprised by how stinking funny (and handsome!) Ryan Gosling is.  The two play off each other really well and it's easy to get engrossed in the story.

Without ruining anything for you guys that haven't seen it yet - there was a plot twist towards the end that *totally* caught me off guard. I was not expecting it in the slightest and I'm usually that person that will ""call it"" 10 minutes into the movie.  I normally don't watch too many movies more than once, but I'm definitely keeping this one in the line-up for when I need a good laugh!

Loved this movie. I would call it a deep drama/ deep dramatic romance filled with bursts of comedy. This movie definiltey made us (wife and i) laugh hard. Steve Carrell definitely mad eus laugh. My wife loves Ryan Gosling! I thought the script was for the most part well written. I don't really have anything bad to say about the film other than they could have edited the edning a little for a more clear ending. Just felt like the movie had a quality that deserved a better ending, not that the ending was bad though !

In his wry understated way, Carell represents the Everyman in us we can sympathize with.  In this film he's surrounded by a talented cast consisting of Julianne Moore as his guilt-ridden wife, Ryan Gosling as the stud who teaches him how to handle women, Emma Stone as the woman who tames Gosling and Kevin Bacon as the office worker caught with his pants down.  They're all fine and aided by a fine script, this is one of the best comedy-dramas to come around in awhile--totally recommended!!",1320624000,,667,4.6440677966101696

Crazy, Stupid, Love is basically as the title says. It is about many characters and family members who are in love or confused about their relationships. The story focuses on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, who were high school sweethearts and have been married for 20 years. She quickly announces that she wants a divorce and Steve needs to start over again as he has never been without her. He meets and is guided by Ryan Gosling to have more confidence and attract women.

There are a lot of huge laughs and some plot twists, which make for a very fun movie. If you are not a fan of any of the cast members, still give this movie a chance as many of them step out of their usual roles.

Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled, Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up from his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.

Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable. The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh. The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages. The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.

It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up.

It examines the nature of love through a number of relationships.  What it is, and what it isn't.

Steve Carrell plays his amusing goofball, clueless dad self.  Ryan Gossling ignites every scene he's in, and is illuminating as the slick romancinator/seducer until he falls for love. Emma Stone is great counterpoint and foil to Gossling's slickness and gives a textured performance.

Everyone knows what happens, Steve's wife leaves him because their marriage is falling apart and because she slept with someone else. Of course, AFTER they separate and Steve sleeps with someone, she's offended because apparently only Julianne is allowed to do that.

All the kids in the movie were little nutcases who will probably spend time in jail at some point. I didn't find the son's obsessive relationship with the babysitter cute, nor did I find her sick obsession with Steve to be heartwarming, either. Besides that, it didn't really drive the plot, and it wasn't funny. So the point was...? Oh and the speech at the end was so ridiculously cheesy I felt uncomfortable watching it.

The only time I laughed out loud was once during a line spoken by Ryan Gosling, but he was also an implausible character because of this sudden altruistic act where he decides to help Steve. Even the trailer showed a scene that sort of explained this (when they're in the bathroom and Steve asks for help) but the movie makes no such effort. Also, his story with Emma Stone was completely ridiculous. When is Hollywood going to stop telling the story of a cute girl who is just so different that she's able to reform a womanizing man without even realizing it? Oh, Hollywood, you are so in touch with real relationships, I applaud you.

My husband and I are in our twenties so there's no issue that we didn't understand it or that it was too racy for us. We just didn't like it. I feel like it had so many big names that they didn't feel they needed to try with silly things like a plot and dialogue.",1320278400,10,1841,4.502994011976048

My husband and I went to see it on a date night, thinking this would be one of the few romantic comedy type movies that we could tolerate, and we were so wrong. There were chunks of the movie that could have been part of a movie I loved, but they were overshadowed by the boring, cheesy, skeevy, superficial parts.

Steve Carrel's relationship with Julianne Moore was interesting, they had some great scenes together, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's chemistry was great. However, the rest of the movie (with a few exceptions) was terrible. It felt like three movies spliced into one. It seemed disjointed and way too long. I have never wondered more about the skill-level and decisions of a movie's editor. Several scenes seemed unnecessary to the story and/or were so long that they sucked the life out of scenes that could have been okay. There were also many scenes where I was aware of the actors acting out the scene instead of believing them as characters.

The storyline with the kids was contrived and boring and includes a scene at the end that was truly disturbing, although it was presented as something endearing, which makes it even more disturbing. There were scenes that were so bad that I felt uncomfortable even sitting in the theater watching it. The ""makeover"" part with Gosling and Carell was way too long and gross. I wanted to walk out, but I felt like I had already invested so much time that I might as well stick it out. It was worth it, the movie did get better. The best scenes are between the ""makeover"" part and the very end. I wish that section were its own movie with Emma Stone as the main character. She was a hundred times more interesting than nearly all of the other characters.

This movie just made me feel depressed and/or like I had missed something. I don't understand how this two-dimensional, rambly movie is receiving so much acclaim. I guess I was expecting something with more depth, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-s-Just-Not-That-Into-You-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0035G7WP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He's Just Not That Into You : Widescreen Edition</a>. It's still a romantic comedy, but its intelligence transcends the genre. It digs into deeper issues and makes you think, and has characters who are relatable. I think Crazy Stupid Love wanted to do this. I think it was supposed to examine the different facets and complications of our relationships with each other, but in the end it just felt soulless and brainless. Yes there were some really good scenes that I loved (yes, loved), but the bad parts were so bad that I can't help but think of the good parts as anything beside aberrations.",1320019200,2,2789,4.9297872340425535

The movie starts out funny. Steve Carrol and his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) are sitting at a restaurant. Steve asks his wife what she wants. She blurts out, "" A divorce."" On the way home Steve jumps out of the car. When they get home, the babysitter asks, ""What happened to you?"" Steve very dryly says, ""Emily said she wanted a divorce and I jumped out of the car."" Meanwhile Emily is discussing with the sitter about her child and broccoli. The sitter had walked in on the 13 year old boy while he was choking his chicken. He in turn tells the babysitter he was thinking of her. This beginning scene had me hooked...then Emma Stone comes on the screen as icing on the cake. 5 star opening scene. Oh and the 17 year old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) has taken a liking to Steve.

Steve does not take the divorce very well. He goes to a bar and pours out his grief to anyone who will listen and sometimes he talks to the thin air. He is taken in under the tutoring of pick-up artist Ryan Gosling who guarantees to make this sad sack into a lady killer. Steve does very well until he opens his mouth. When he talks he makes women want to leave the bar....with Ryan Gosling. Eventually Steve becomes a master Jedi. Kevin Bacon plays David Lindhagen, the ""other man.""

The movie has many LOL moments, great characters and great actors with a wonderful climax scene. From the title you should be able to figure out this is a chick flick.",1318723200,2,1457,4.408921933085502
4227640,4,B003Y5H57E,"Perhaps the best pairing is of Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling. They are both big talents with Gosling coming up very strong on the outside. He picks his roles better than Carrell across the board and that could be because he's been in the business since he was a kid with the Mickey Mouse Club. He's paid his dues. The two men have many excellent scenes together with Gosling having the harder role as a womanizer whom you grow to like, a real feat. The film is both a comedy and a drama since it tries to stay close to real life.

This is an ensemble piece, however, which may have prevented the two men from being really great. We had many other characters including many women, two kids, Julianne Moore as the wife, and Marisa Tomei in a smaller role as a teacher. So they all have their fallings in and out of love too and, even Kevin Bacon has a small role as Carrell's wife's love interest, which causes her to open the movie with asking for a divorce.

Emma Stone as the divorcing couple's lawyer daughter who begins dating Gosling without her father knowing also shows a great deal of promise.  She was probably the best woman in the film, followed closely by Tomei.

I think why so many people like this movie is because of the sincere vulnerability of Steve Carell's character. His wife is the only woman he loved and he is honest about it.
Is this suitable for a 13 year old? A teen age boy jerking off, a teenage girl taking nude pictures of herself, a wife cheating on her husband, a man sleeping with a different woman every night, a boy who thinks his dad is a rival for a teenage girl's affections, a man having sex with his son's teacher?

This movie is at times touching and at other hilarious.  I was completely convinced these people were more than just who they initially appeared to be.

Like many modern films and television shows, CSL is a ""dramedy."" When the genre is at its best, like in CSL, it really works, reaching the audience on many levels. The whole theatre laughed uproariously at the goofy parts and seemed moved by the story, which was insightful and sweet. Using Steve Carrell, Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone made a big difference to the dramatic parts of the story. Because they aren't known for being in tons of puffy rom-coms, they came off as sincere and likable (except for maybe Moore, but I think that was a conscious choice on her part.) The plot devices seemed less formulaic in their capable hands.

Yes, I said formulaic, but I still found it well-written, sometimes the clique is the right choice. I appreciated the cultural references which were mainstream and fun. More daring was the soundtrack, but it fit the film well. The cinematography also aided the storytelling of the film, there was a good amount of grain and handheld shooting that gave it a more organic quality.

Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.

The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.

Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's ""It"" girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check.

4227652,4,B003Y5H57E,"As comedies go, I think this is probably one of the better ones you will see this year.

Steve Carell plays Cal, a husband who splits from his high school sweetheart, played by Julianne Moore, after she cheats.  Hanging out in single bars every nights he sees this ladies man played by Ryan Gosling successfully pick up numerous women, while he says out loud to anyone who will listen, 'my wife cheated on me with xxxx.'

Meanwhile his teenage son has the hots for his babysitter, while the babysitter crushes on Cal. We have 4 romantic triangles between the main characters, that are developed to great comic effect.

So, Ryan Gosling's character takes him under his wing, as his wing man, and shows him how to score with the ladies, which leads to many interesting twists and turns.

There were several parts of this movie that made me cringe, one was the patheticness of the character played by Steve Carell.  The teenage crush made me cringe a little, especially with the absurd things this kid did to get her attention.

In fairness this was more than balanced with some high quality scenes and interactions, particularly the scenes with Marisa Tomei, who I thought was absolutely brilliant, especially when her simmering emotions boil over at the parent teacher meeting.

The Dirty Dancing routine between  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was simply movie magic, and one of the best scenes I have seen all year, two quality actors, chemistry, everything, perfect.

I have a sneaking suspicion that Ryan Gosling may be one the best actors on the planet.  You probably know him from The Notebook, a perennial top 100 rental on leading dvd rental sites.  He has studously avoided the mainstream doing indie and art house movies.  Watching his performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Valentine/dp/B004R170M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Valentine</a>&nbsp;with Michelle Williams convinced me of his greatness, with some reminders of a young DeNiro, without the psychotic overtones, or even perhaps Sean Penn, the most respected actor among his peers.

The proof may not be out there yet, and I am so glad to see him to see him in a mainstream movie.  I hope that he will continue to make critically acclaimed movies and also more widely seen movies, and that he will get both the recognition, and ultimately the accolades he deserves.

Emma Stone, what can you say, she is the best of the young actresses who has emerged over the last two years, outstanding in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-A/dp/B0036TGSIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy A</a>, and now the lead in The Help, for which she may get an Oscar nom.

4227653,5,B003Y5H57E,"""Crazy Stupid Love"" is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying.

Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to ""stop talking."" When she keeps talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene.

I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that made me look twice. ""The Notebook"" was one of the blandest and most forgettable movies I've ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too hard.

Gosling's Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest, subtlest performances I've ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, ""Do you want to get out of here?"" Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha male, as if he were a silverback gorilla - or Frank Sinatra - even while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He's Buddy Love on steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film - and I did not - I'd watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it.

Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie's love, but it never did - in fact it got a little weird - and I liked that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love.

There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams and plans smashed - and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside of participants' hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers.

""Crazy Stupid Love"" includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light. This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its best. Steve Carrel could not be better in this scene.",1313539200,,2632,4.589361702127659
4227654,5,B003Y5H57E,"Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.

Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided to check out ""Crazy Stupid Love"", because it had decent critical and audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by surprise.

One of the reasons for this, is because ""Crazy Stupid Love"" works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is going. While the ending itself is alot like I predicted it, there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.

However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grown-up way.

It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily (Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter, who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.

And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that guy from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.

Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the audience.

While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role in ""The Help"", she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character is instantly lovable, and I can't wait to see what she does next.

This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as Emily's co-worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.

What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out, and occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot. And while it could have been a bit longer, and given its characters some more room to grow, it was a satisfying overall package that I would recommend to someone who's trying to escape the summer of superhero flicks and sequels.",1313280000,7,4300,4.610457516339869

Although I love this movie, the picture is too small and dark.",1528848000,,164,3.823529411764706

8408715,3,B003Y5H57E,"Good movie, horrible sound track/songs. Julianne Moore great in this, Steve Carell good, Ryan Gosling and Emma were excellent, the son was terrific, loved seeing Marisa Tomei in this. The last seconds of the film were a song which began with the words 'and the cancer spread all over her body'... What??? There was nothing like that in the entire film. I hate that kind of subliminal brainwashing stuff which subtly said that even if it all worked and they look like they're again in love, that cancer will spread all over her body and ruin their lives anyway. There was another subliminal 'got ya' song in the film also. Total ruination of a good movie. What are you thinking???? That we don't hear the words? Stupid movie industry, always being destructive, always fueling the insanity or infusing fear even in the most subtle ways, even in an otherwise good movie like this. Steve Carell, you directed or produced this film, it said. You also lost my 'liking you' if you okayed that music and that song at the end. Feel forced to boycott and say 'we're not as dumb as you think' and again, what were you trying to say by putting that at the end of the film and ruining the entire movie for us? The film only gets 3 stars due to that alone.",1526774400,,1242,4.475770925110132
8408716,3,B003Y5H57E,I am a huge Ryan Gosling fan; also enjoy Julianne Moore which is why I purchased the movie.  Guess my expectations were a bit high with those 2 actors; it was just okay.  I gave it 3 stars because of Ryan Gosling.,1525564800,,213,4.0476190476190474
