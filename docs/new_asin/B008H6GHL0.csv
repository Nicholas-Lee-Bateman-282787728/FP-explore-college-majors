5162516,5,B008H6GHL0,"For those of you that don't know, this movie is on PSN and i got to watch it early :D. Anyways, this movie is everything degeneration wasn't. The characters look better this time around and the story is super interesting! I don't want to spoil much but, let's just say that the last 40 min of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat as Leon has the fight of his life with some scary dudes. Lickers are in this movie and they are brutal! This movie has lot's of gore, action, and a bad@zz Leon. Ada also shines in this movie, so the spot light isn't always on Leon. Voice acting is awesome, action is amazing, sound, explosions, some humor, tear jerking moments, overall A MUST SEE!",1348185600,3,690,4.2748091603053435
5162517,5,B008H6GHL0,"Ordered this for my son who's a fan of Resident Evil series.
Great CGI, storyline. Not my style, But he says its awesome!!
Great transaction!",1348185600,,141,4.68
5162518,5,B008H6GHL0,"Resident Evil: Damnation improves upon the first Resident Evil CG movie, Degeneration, by leaps and bounds! Not only did Capcom tweak the appearances of the characters (and for the better!) when in comparison to the last movie, they also took many demands of the fans to heart. A good part of the appeal of the Resident Evil franchise is its trademark monsters, in which case this feature film does not fail to resurrect some of the most notorious creatures from the more classic games of the series. That does not go to say that they have done away with the new, either. With an interesting blending of creatures, Damnation takes that next step into the future of Resident Evil, teasing you with what is to come a few weeks down the line with Resident Evil 6.

The plot at first may seem difficult to follow, but with Leon Scott Kennedy holding the reigns and Ada Wong throwing him a bone here and there, the story definitely does not disappoint. Between all of the monsters, fighting, and oh yeah... more monsters... You really appreciate the effort that was placed in the finer details that truly connect this movie with the rest of the series. Whereas Degeneration felt slightly more disjointed, Damnation is much better woven into the framework of the global threat of Bio-Terror looming on the horizon. The world really is turning into a mess and it's only a matter of time before it spins horribly out of control. This gives the film the intricacies and polish that its predecessor was lacking.

If you're new to the series, the gore and rather flavorful action scenes may be enough to hook you. However, for loyal fans this is a breath of fresh air and you will feel entrenched in Leon's cause and perplexed by all of the questions the ending scenes present.",1347667200,67,1766,4.67524115755627
5162519,1,B008H6GHL0,"I run a mobile babysitting service from my van.
I was at the local Mexican grocery store picking up some treats for the kids. As I was exiting the store, I passed a folding table setup where they sell the latest movies in the theather or about to be in the theather.
When I saw the Resident Evil cartoon I was pretty excited (I almost dropped my groceries.) Cash only transaction, I immediately bought a copy. To be honest, most teenagers and young adults know who or what 'Resident Evil' is, but not kids. In a brilliant moves by the powers involved, this animated movie seemed like a great introduction to a younger audience.
Locking the van doors in a dark and abandonded parking-lot, we planned on having a fun summer spook fest watching the movie.
This did not play out exactly as I had hoped.
The animation was good, but it just wasn't a kid-friendly movie in hindsight.
In fact, most of the kids had soiled themselves and damaged the door of the van trying to get out. A couple of them threw up ruining the carpeted walls and floor (guess I know who won't be coming back after I send their parents the cleaning bill.)",1346025600,26,1124,4.434782608695652
5162520,5,B008H6GHL0,"Didn't see this movie yet - but am looking forward to it. If you are also looking forward to it maybe you should see it, get the DVD, it could be a really good film as i saw the first one.",1345507200,4,188,3.6097560975609757

A lot of fun.  I wish more games had these sorts of movies for those of us who don't have the video game controller reflexes we used to have in our youth.",1504483200,,322,4.015625

5162575,2,B008H6GHL0,I have watched other CGI films before and have enjoyed them. I consider them to be more cartoon than film. Having said that this was awful and even more awful. Some pointless story about an American being dropped into some Eastern European hot zone and them told to leave? he stays of course and has to get to the bottom of the mystery. He is held prisoner by everyone so I would certainly just say screw it and leave. the CGI wasn't the best and the story and dialog was terrible. I recommend this to no one. Not even the die hard Resident Evil fans.,1493942400,,551,4.257142857142857
5162576,5,B008H6GHL0,Got here early in the day. Packaged very nicely. And came with the UV code. Can't ask for more. The RE animated series is so great and in my opinion better than the movies (even though I am a fan of the movies).

5162612,5,B008H6GHL0,an awesome follow up to the last CGI movie. I like the live action but it doesn't compair to the CGI movies. leon and ada make a  return in this film this film also contians a digital copy of UltraViolet for download. so its two for the price of one (very nice) not really a fan of ultra violent but i like the actress Mila Jovavitch.,1489449600,,334,4.0606060606060606
5162613,5,B008H6GHL0,"A great movie related to the game. Surprised to Leon at it again and in the other side of US. Still a badass series made from Capcom.

5162813,3,B008H6GHL0,"I should start by saying I don't play any of these video games but have watched all of the films.  So it does not matter to me how close the films are to a game's ""plot"".  The 2 media are so different they should be treated as separate entities I think.  This is an animated feature in a storied sci-fi series.  Resident Evil started out for me as a too-violent zombie/sci-fi hybrid film, which got quite a bit more interesting in the first and second sequels, but then took an abrupt turn downhill.  Out of the sticky black tarpit that the Resident Evil series had become arisesthis sticky black creature of the lagoon called Damnation.  Yes, its very loosely in the Resident Evil universe.  At least it depicts creatures much like those seen in the other movies.  But it has no obvious plot connection to the other films which at least had a sort of time-continuity to them.  Upside: it is set in some post-USSR Soviet satellite country [with a pseudonym] and resonates with some very modern post-cold-war realpolitiks.  Downside: characterization is juvenile.  Scripting is juvenile.  Plot is juvenile.  Interestingly it was actually produced in Japan, not in East Europe, which is nominally the setting.  Apart from some brief interest in how real-world politics inserts itself into a sci-fi film, I did not feel theres much of interest here.  But if you want to watch a video game without the effort of PLAYING it...enjoy.",1439683200,,1427,4.790983606557377

5162850,5,B008H6GHL0,"this is a first class animated film that is part of the resident evil series. Which is called biohazard in japan.  This is out only in 2d in the u.s.  which completely is LAME. As this was made to be seen in 3d. It was filmed that way and many shots are designed for a 3d effect, or animated that way!  This story is decent too.  It's  a shame that few will ever know that there is a 3d edition of this movie , and that the 2d version is not the real version that was released to movie theaters in japan.  It's very expensive because of it being a limited edition 3d blu ray.  Which is not a good thing. We should have had the opportunity to get this one over here. but at least this is a region a 3d blu ray , it has the 2d version too, which means that you can watch it on your blu ray player  without a all region blu ray player.  Because JAPAN and the u.s. are in the same region.  This is much better in 3d , and it's a decent animated resident evil story. without the main female lead in it though.  I don't know if they will ever make a live action 'resident evil' movie again.  But at least you have two animated films and this one is in true 3d.",1426896000,,1154,3.9055793991416308

Leon's running around pretty much by himself. He doesn't really have a steady partner throughout this, which kind of took away from the traditional Resident Evil feel.

There are some hilarious one-liners that are meant to be funny, but they're campy-funny. It was something fun to watch with my fiance, my partner-in-crime, especially since we've played through RE5 and RE6 together recently. (Neither were all that great, but the cutscenes were fun? I enjoyed RE5 a lot more than RE6.) Anyhow. Storyline-wise, who isn't looking for a little more Leon? Could do without Ada, though. But.. wherever he goes, she must follow. *sigh*

The writing is... a bit too obvious. Weak dialogue. Slightly choppy voice acting but still professional. (I can chalk it up to directing because I can't imagine real VA's taking the initiative to deliver lines like that.) Overall: I'd watch this over the newest live-action ""Resident Evil movies"" any day. Even if one-liner Leon is a bit out of character.",1417305600,,1139,5.053191489361702

The scene between the agent and the ex-spec ops trainer was definitely something worth watching.

5163525,4,B008H6GHL0,"Great addition to the games - sticks closer to the existing mythology that was created prior to the live action movies (seemingly ignoring the live action movies altogether, actually) and presents a better, more engaging, and better acted movie than its live action counterparts (especially the latter ones).

Animation and quality is top notch, although some of the characters have the distinct feeling of being animated to look like they exist in the game (too many superfluous movement, awkward stances, frantic arm and have waving but little finger movement, etc.) - not sure if this was intentional or not.  In fact, the character this occurred most with (the soldier with the green hair) also happened to have the worst lines and ended up being the one thing I think that brought the movie down.

Overall, the story itself was interesting, and I like seeing Leon return (big fan of Resident Evil 2 and 4) as the protagonist and the return of some old monsters.  It took a few turns I wasn't expecting and keep me curious to the final outcome.  Highly recommend for any fan of the series or the genre in general.",1414368000,,1117,4.766839378238342

5163595,3,B008H6GHL0,"I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series. I've watched nearly all of the movies, played several of the games across many different platforms (starting with RE 2), and read many of the novels.

I was super excited to learn about this movie when it first came out. I loved the first CG animated flim and watched it at least 5 times. This movie had a high expectations to meet.

Graphics/visuals- Simply astounding. Many of the scenes were so lifelike that you could easily forgot you were watching a computer animated film! The level of detail went as far as having each individual strand of hair doing its own thing. Talk about painstaking for the developers, I'm sure. I cannot fathom a way they could have improved on this aspect of the movie, unless they went 3d and somehow had the licker tongue actually come out and graze your cheek. That is to say, the visuals were superb.

Story- Decent, not great. Leon Kennedy joins up with a revolution of people trying to overthrow the Government of a smaller country. Thing is, they are using umbrella created monsters to achieve this goal. As you can probably guess, Leon doesn't approve of this at all. Through a twist of fate, he ends up joining their ranks to take down an even worse foe. I'll try not to spoil anything. As I was watching this movie, I kept thinking it was over during the scene breaks. Never a good sign when a movie that lasts just over an hour and a half seems like it is 3 hours long. Maybe some of the non-fight sequences should have been shortened.

Dialogue- Overall good, but there were a few lines that made me laugh because they were so cheesy. I can't remember the exact phrase, but near the end of the movie Leon tries to convince the leader of the rebellion that he has a reason to live. Even though this was meant to be a very dramatic, heartfelt moment the line he said made me chuckle, totally killing the climax of the scene. There were other cases like this, but that one sticks out most in my mind.

Overall, it was very well animated but probably should have been further developed story-wise with more attention given to dialogue. Maybe I'll devote the time to watch it again, but the fact that I'm hesitant suggests it wasn't nearly as great as it should have been.",1384819200,,2256,4.466019417475728

I've been waiting for this movie to come out since early 2011 and when it finally came out last year 2012 I ran to best buy and brought it with no hesitation. When I came home that day I immediately poped this in my PS3 hoping for the best and I sat in my chair amazed by how intense this movie really was. Degeneration has nothing on this I said while watching the movie. If you haven't seen this movie GO out to best buy or whatever store sells dvd's and get this.

5163668,4,B008H6GHL0,"Resident Evil: Degeneration and Damnation both average 4 stars on Amazon and Degeneration is cheaper so you might as well get Degeneration, correct? Wrong. Regardless of the Amazon ratings Damnation is a significant improvement over Capcom's previous effort and one of the best movie translations of a video game ever. It's certainly better than the live action movies which have almost nothing to do with the video games they claim to be based off of

Damnation feels more like the natural successor to RE 4 than Degeneration with the viral infection being Plagas rather than the G/T-Virus. Leon Kennedy finds himself embroiled in an uprising in an eastern European country. In a desperate move the insurgents have resorted to using BOW's in their fight having managed to gain technology that allows them to control the usually uncontrollable horrors. After nearly being killed by a Licker, Leon is captured by a trio of insurgents who believe him to be a CIA agent. At the same time the Plagas is starting to spread and things are quickly going to Hell.

The CGI is much better in Damnation, in particular the facial modeling. Degeneration had this weird plastic look to the faces but here they are much more expressive. Leon still has a perpetual glare, unlike in the video games, but at least he's shown to be capable of other expressions. The backgrounds are gorgeous bordering on photorealistic. The CGI still lags behind the top American studios particularly in character movement. There is a fight between Ada Wong and one of the main antagonists that is very stiff and robotic. American studios have done an amazing job of making movements feel natural and organic and there is definitely room for improvement here but for a movie that didn't even get a theatrical release in the U.S. this is very good stuff and a huge improvement over Degeneration.

One of my big issues with Degeneration was the lack of variety in BOW's (bio-organic weapons). I counted two including zombies and the inevitable G-Virus final boss. Damnation ups the count with a whopping three BOW types including the Licker, Plagas zombies and Tyrant. Seriously Capcom, there are dozens and dozens of BOW's and all you include are three? Another thing is that although the tyrants look visually stunning they don't really look like Tyrants or even organisms from Resident Evil. They look more like giant blue aliens. Another problem I have is with Leon Kennedy's bizarre lack of inner monologue. At one point he comes across a CIA contact named Scarecrow who's been beaten near death. Initially Scarecrow can only utter a gurgle prompting Leon to turn his head and mutter, `I guess scarecrows aren't known for their rousing conversation'. Seriously? You say that to a man near death who's seconds away from being ripped to shreds? In another instance Leon is flung by a Tyrant 30 feet into a marble pillar (a move that should have killed or permanently incapacitated Leon). Leon drags himself up saying, `You really shouldn't have done that' Leon had nothing to back up his boast and looks silly with his empty hubris. These goofy lines are all though the movie and I'm not sure if this is an accurate translation or just some weak dubbing.

Lastly the ending here is pretty cheap but in the end Damnation has better characterization, a better storyline and better CGI than Degeneration. Let me also add that many of the scene backgrounds look like they were ripped right from the games so it really feels like the movie is in the same universe as the games. I have seen so many game translations that felt like the creators wanted to make anything other than a video game movie. I'm not sure why it's so hard to set a movie in the same universe as the game but Capcom pulls it off. Hopefully this is just the next installment in a long line of movies that continue to improve.",1359331200,,3857,4.795488721804511

If you are a big fan of the RE video games as I am, these CG movies are much better, add to the real story from the games and use the same voice actors from the games.  When you're watching Claire or Leon, you are watching the same characters from the games, not some live actor's interpretation of the character.  And it's (almost) always disappointing when, for example, the live actor of Claire Redfield is just not like the Claire from the games, in looks or mannerisms.",1357430400,,595,4.333333333333333

Enough action, great animation, and lots of classic, slightly out-of-place one-liners from Leon that we've grown to love. My sister enjoyed it too even though she's less familiar with the games' storylines. Some slow and overly dramatic parts, but worth it overall, especially for the bigger fighting scenes. Decent voice-acting, despite the forced accents. Even if you are too distracted by the CG to pay close attention to the story, it's still easy enough to follow, and the characters are the important part of the story anyway.

5163709,4,B008H6GHL0,"I generally prefer the Milla Jovovich live action flicks. but, if you like the CGI flicks, you'll probably think this one is okay. Not ""great,"" just okay. Seems some country or another in Europe is using Bio-Organic Weapons, as are the rebels in that country. In the end, it's a reasonably fun flick as long as you don't expect anything too deep.

If you're looking for heavy duty zombie action, you'll probably prefer the first 3-4 Resident Evil live action movies. This one focuses more on the Bio-Organic Weapons. Toward the end of the movie, some of the BOWs, being controlled by one of the rebels become almost empathetic / heroic creatures as they're used against and get thrashed by even more powerful, nearly indestructible BOWs. I say nearly, 'cause apparently a tank shell to the face or an airstrike can take them out, but not much short of that. One wonders, where do you go from there?? Completely indestructible BOWs? There wouldn't be much of a story there...

Kinda' mindless entertainment.

I didn't find it particularly 'scary.' 'Cause, I mean, it's just computer animated and doesn't ""look"" real. So there's that uncanny valley that keeps you from completely suspending disbelief.

5163712,3,B008H6GHL0,"Resident Evil-Damnation(released Sept/12)is another computer generated animated Resident Evil entry,which I thought had a lot of potential,but just didn't come up to snuff in so far as the executing of its plot in an efficient and timely manner,was concerned.
This time around we find an American agent,Leon,dropped into the eastern Slav republic to verify the presence of BOWS or bio organic weaponry against its citizens. This section of Europe has been under siege for years. First its citizenry were uprising against the government. Then the government,backed by big business(the Umbrella Corp),has decided to take back what the rebels gained. Umbrella is playing both sides against each other by supplying bio weaponry to all. The rebels gain access to Las Plagas,which can enhance the energy of its user and can also be used to control the Lickers,the ones who crawl on all fours and have long tongues. The government also has that capability but also have the use of a super-soldier of sorts,that they hold off using until the time is right.
The female leader of the Slav republic wants desperately to become a member of the UN but cannot get that sanction until the on going hostilities are resolved satisfactorily. Ada Wong appears acting as an emissary to the president,but she is really working for herself and is there to retrieve a Las Plagas sample for people unknown. When her cover is blown Ada will battle the president and her aide and flee,running into Leon and assisting him sporadically throughout. Leon,in the meantime will join up with the rebels in their battles with the government and learn more about what and who controls Las Plagas. At one point Leon tries to beat and recover the injecting fluid and needles of Las Plagas,but will be beaten there by the rebel leader who will inject himself with it.
Leon will witness the up close and personal placing of a large Las Plagas entity,down the throat of an unfortunate soldier,he will battle The Lickers,then he,with the rebel leaders help and control of the Lickers,do the final battle with large Tyrants,who are large super soldiers,about 10-12 ft.tall,and impervious to most regular forms of deterrents. In fact as two Tyrants rush Leon,an American jet appears overhead and takes them both out with smart missiles.
The film ends as Leon watches the news about the Russian-American take over of the Slav Republic. We also see Ada holding a large Las Plagas creature in a tube,and talking about whether or not she will in fact hand the creature over.
I found the plot poorly executed,and as much as I delighted in seeing all these new creatures and methods of infections,it wasn't enough to offset the boredom created. The film is certainly true to its game roots though,in look and feel. Leon moves cautiously through empty garages,warehouses etc.,while you get the feel that you should have a game controller in your hand as his flashlight pierces the darkness. The CG graphics are also excellent. Some may find this a bit absurd,but I found the lips sometimes out of sync with the voices. I know this is animation,but RE-Degeneration was much more realistic in that respect. If there hadn't been so much slow time,and it had moved more like its predecessor RE-Regeneration,this film would have been a winner.
The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a gag reel,commentaries and featurettes.
All in all a disappointing CG animated entry in the Resident Evil canon. It had great potential but its' meandering and stop and go plot,hindered it greatly. It's graphics are excellent but its not enough to give this film any better than a mediocre mark.",1356480000,,3661,4.954471544715447

If you took the love of the whole zombie genre and the love of action horror in general, then this movie would be its love child. If this game was in jail for committing a serious crime, the other video game inmates would be its ... well, you know. :) Gotta keep it classy for the massy. Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled programming: ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" came out at the right time when the gapping in the franchise was widening.

When I finally sat down and watched this animated version I was truly impressed with the graphics, music, and story.  This is well worth viewing, not only if you are a fan of the game, Resident Evil movies, or Science Fiction/Horror in general.  Based on the movies and/or game, this feature follows intrepid US undercover agent and Umbrella agent in Russia dealing with the political turmoil escalating to a war between the government and a rebel faction.  When the use of Bio Organic Weapons (BOW)s - (Umbrella Monsters), is deemed acceptable, the war gets ugly.  What was the biggest surprise to me was the comedy, it had several ""quotable"" lines that I enjoyed.

5163751,4,B008H6GHL0,"It's a month of ""Resident Evil"" as the live action film ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" was just released in theaters nationwide and the video game ""Resident Evil 6 is slated for release on October 2, 2012.  So, why not add another CG film to the mix with the release of ""Resident Evil: Damnation"", the second full-length motion capture CG animation feature based on CAPCOM's ""Resident Evil"" game series.

While the film will be released in theaters in Japan in October 2012, the Blu-ray and DVD was released on Sept. 25, 2012.

VIDEO:

""Resident Evil: Damnation"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  And the first thing you will notice is how much more detailed the CG animation is with ""Damnation"" compared to the ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" released back in 2008.  The motion capture is fantastic as the expressions and mannerisms of a character is well-captured.  But the detail of facial characteristics on Leon S. Kennedy's, Ada Wong and the President's face is remarkable.  There is a lot of detail that can be seen with the characters, as well as the monstrous beasts.  Overall, the CG for ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" looks fantastic in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Resident Evil: Damnation"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For an action-intense film such as ""Resident Evil: Damnation"", I was expecting an immersive soundtrack.  While the dialogue and sound effects did sound good, coming from the front channel, I was hoping to hear more LFE and the surround channels.  To have a more immersive soundtrack, because there is so much action.  The lossless soundtrack is good but I was expecting much more ambiance, good directional use of bullets being shot and explosions to be much more immersive.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Resident Evil: Damnation"" comes with the following special features:

  Conceptual Art Gallery - Using your remote, you can cycle through the various art throughout the film. (a Blu-ray exclusive)
  Las Plagas: Organisms of War  - (6:59) A short feature about the parasites that can be used for biological warfare.
  The DNA of Damnation -  (30:05) Interviews with the Japanese creators of ""Resident Evil: Damnation"".
  Gag Reel - (6:03) English voice dub outtakes.
  Resident Evil 6 Trailer - (3:54) The video game trailer for ""Resident Evil 6.
  Devil May Cry Trailer - (2:14) The video game trailer for the upcoming ""Devil May Cry"" game.
  Dragon's Dogma Trailer - (2:06) The video game trailer for Dragon's Dogma.

EXTRAS:

""Resident Evil: Damnation"" comes with a UltraViolet redemption code.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Since the release of the first ""Resident Evil"" game for the Sony Playstation back in 1996, I have been a fan of the series purchasing the many games that have been released on various consoles, portable consoles and have also enjoyed the live-action films, despite the differences with the video game series.  As well, as enjoying the first CG film, ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"".

With the release of ""Resident Evil: Redemption"" in theaters and the exciting trailer for ""Resident Evil 6 having been unveiled this past summer and wowing video gamers for its incredible detail and amount of characters being featured, when I found out that ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" was coming out, I was happy because it featured the reunion of Leon and Ada, two characters who were fantastic together in the hit video game ""Resident Evil 4.

Watching ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" and seeing these two characters once again, I'm a little torn of how I feel for the CG animated film.  In one sense, I felt the CG animation, the motion capture effects and the detail of Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong in this film were fantastic.

In fact, there are times where I felt this film was more ""visual eye-candy"" as it not only showcased the sexiness of Ada Wong's character but also showing us why she is an exciting character that can kick a lot of butt but also why she is also a dangerous character that can't be trusted.

And of course, Leon is the ultimate hero but also becoming more of an unstoppable character in the ""Resident Evil"" series.  Awesome with weaponry, great at fighting and both he and Ada were popular characters that no doubt were showcased because people want to see more of them.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the details featured in ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" have some tie-in with ""Resident Evil 6 and seen with the trailer, Leon and possibly Ada have an important role in the upcoming game and it looks as if Leon is the protagonist once again.

So, while CG animation and the action sequences were magnificent, the storyline was not as OK.  If anything, this CG animated film is pretty much a popcorn action film to showcase both Leon and Ada kicking butt.  Nothing more, nothing less.

I don' t think there was anything related to the story that captured my attention.  If anything, those moments to see Ada taking on the president in hand-to-hand combat was impressive, seeing Leon taking on these hulking monolith army was reminiscent of the older ""Terminator"" films.  And that is what impressed me the most about this film.  Primarily the action sequences, rather than the storyline which was forgettable and if it was to be important, the writing surely didn't make us care at all.

The Blu-ray release showcases the amazing CG animation of this film.  Details on HD are impressive, especially the closeups.  The lossless soundtrack was not as great as I was hoping.  I was hoping for more immersiveness, because this film featured so much action.  But while dialogue and action were crystal clear from the front channels, I was hoping more noticeable uses of the surround and rear surround channels and LFE.  There are a few special features that were included and it was cool to hear from the Japanese creators of the challenges that went into making this film.

""Resident Evil: Damnation"" will excite ""Resident Evil"" fans who loved seeing Leon and Ada kick butt in ""Resident Evil 4.  The two are reunited again and it's their action sequences that will no less excite fans who are eagerly awaiting the video game release of ""Resident Evil 6.  This is the best I have seen of Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong and I'm sure fans will appreciate that.  But as far as the story is concerned, those who have never played the ""Resident Evil"" games can easily watch this film without knowing the background of the video game series or knowledge of its characters.

Exciting, action-packed and featuring fantastic CG animation and use of motion capture, ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" is a popcorn action film that focuses a little too much on the action, while the storyline feels as if it is not important nor does it have any affect on the actual video game series storyline involving Umbrella.  But if you are a ""Resident Evil 4 fan and want to see Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong together again, then ""Resident Evil: Damnation"" is for you!",1354320000,,6989,4.887755102040816
5163752,4,B008H6GHL0,"I didn't care for the first Resident Evil CGI film ""Degeneration"". I thought it was very boring, with uninteresting new characters, and a forgettable plot.

This sequel ""Damnation"" is a lot more entertaining. Way more action, and a lot of scenes feel like you're watching someone play Resident Evil! Very fun.

My biggest gripe with the film is an annoying comedic character that follows Leon around. With a very, horrible, 'Russian accent'. The voice actor for this guy somehow forgot and got lost in the accent because eventually the character goes from a generic faux Russian accent to sounding like Triumph the Insult Dog from the Conan O'Brien show.

Seriously, if it wasn't for that idiotic character I would have given the movie all five stars on this review.",1354147200,,766,4.922480620155039

5163766,4,B008H6GHL0,I thought this was a sequel to the other CGI Resident Evil? It feels like a stand- alone movie... which I guess is what the producers want anyway. My comment is that this is so short,1353715200,,182,4.083333333333333
5163767,3,B008H6GHL0,As a resident evil fan I collect the series......as far as CGI goes it is very good...but don't expect it to align itself well with the episodes with real humans in them.....its like they took a side trip with this one....,1353628800,,222,4.439024390243903

5163769,3,B008H6GHL0,"I really really love Animated films and I'm even going to college for this, so for me the CGI was amazing, however, not so much the actual animation as sometimes characters do the weirdest movements. It does not ruin the movie experience at any point but sometimes audio seems a bit off. The biggest issue that I have personally as far as character design is Ada Wong, I don't think anyone else will have a problem with this but Ada to me in this movie looks bad in terms of design. I really hated how dried her lips were and how her cheeks were a little bulky giving her more of an american look rather than asian look. I know she's just has a chinese decent but she didn't look chinese at all to me. Just saying...

So the biggest problem that I think this movie has and as well as most Japanese Animated films is story line.. I guess the Animation must take up so much time they sacrifice story because just like Tekken, RE: Degeneration, and other ones.. The story lacks in so many ways and sometimes you cant really take anything serious. You cant really Compare them to Pixar/Disney, or Dreamworks as these films are more CGI heavy compared to the american comapanies. I love Japanese animation more for this but I am still waiting for that one movie to really blow my mind.

This movie as an overall is okay for those Resident Evil fans and as well for those who just want entertainment..
Pretty good for those who love Animated films such as myself..
Terrible for those are looking for good quality films with amazing story line and amazing CGI",1353110400,,1552,4.442105263157894
5163770,3,B008H6GHL0,"The film was beautiful in a visual since and the big boys in black were more scary than any of the zombie or licker characters... Although it was a great way spend an evening the story (unless your a Resident Evil fan from the beginning) lost me. The gorgeous chic in the heels was a character I have never seen before but the story went on as though she was a character from back in the day. The president and her awesome back scar even showed a little skin and on top of that did some great CQB with the formentioned chic in heels... that was... GREAT! But we keep coming back to leon and his little rebel group... I don't know if I got up to get a beer or went to take a leak and missed some vital plot points or what but I found my understanding of the plot missing some key points. Leon crying about his vacation (get a haircut and get over it, douche bag) the lickers were so formidable in the past CGI's of the franchise but the big boys in black treated them as though they were roaches under foot. SO, who was the old man? Who was the school teacher turned rebel leader turned crippled school teaher? What happened to the dumb bimbo from the other films? If it were not for the giant SS storm troopers completly crushing everything and everyone at the climax I would have come away with alot of questions but it was still a fun dive into the genra even if it left me feeling as though I came into the conversation late. The relationship between America and Russia? Who was the hotty talking to at the end about the cheesy organism in the jar? Just so many questions... Not all that many zombies now that I think about it. Do any of these CGI productions fall in line with either the movie story lines or the video game's story? I suspect this film would blow your mind if you smoked some good grass or took some bad s%#t and sat there watched it on an empty stomach. Perhaps it would all make since then.",1352937600,,1913,4.201086956521739

5163773,4,B008H6GHL0,"Let me confess and say that I have never played any of the Resident Evil games.  But, I have watched all of the live-action Resident Evil movies.  And, I am a fan of the movie franchise!  So, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.

The story follows U.S. agent Leon Kennedy as he makes his way through the war-torn parts of the former Soviet Union.  For many years after the break up of the state, rebels have been waging war against the government in order to gain their independence.  At one point, a truce was agreed on, but the discovery of valuable natural resources within the territory occupied by the rebels brought back conflict.  The government is now reluctant to allow the rebels to carve out their own territory.  Not now that oil has been discovered there!  Meanwhile, the current head of the government, Svetlana Belikova, has worked out a way to get rid of the rebels once and for all.  As Leon carries out his independent investigation (the U.S. government has called back its agents), he meets  up with two members of the rebel group.  Sasha and JD are both leaders within the rebel army.

And it would not be a Resident Evil movie without those menacing ""Bio-Hazards"", right?  Don't you worry.  There's plenty here.  It seems both sides are using them as weapons.  Using the Plaga organism, both sides can now control the bioweapons.  A method has been found to control the bio-weapons because there are subordinate types and dominant types of this parasite.  Basically, the same principle that works in the relationship between a queen bee and her worker bees.  Using the same principle, engineered at the genetic level, the government has found a way to control the bio-weapons by infecting them with the Plaga parasite.  Eager to use this technology against the government, Sasha steals a sample of the parasite.  Sasha injects himself with the mutation agent so that he can transform into the equivalent of the ""queen bee"", or what is known as the ""Dominant Plaga"".

Sasha and Leon infiltrate the Presidential palace.  With the help of an old friend (Ada Wong), Leon makes his way down to the underground research facility.  Sasha brings along his bioweapons, overpowers the government soldiers and leads a raid on the research facility.  President Svetlana, who is also underground, waits until the rebels are all underground.  And then she initiates a lock-down, trapping the rebels underground.  But, not before she releases two of the most fearsome creatures ever to appear in the Resident Evil franchise!  Sasha's bio-weapons (the lickers, basically) are no match for the government's latest bio-engineered weapons.  Basically, these new government weapons are a highly-advanced, re-engineered  versions of the Tyrant T-103.

This is a very, very good movie.  Those bio-engineered weapons are the scariest, baddest adversaries ever to appear in the franchise.  The voice-acting is nothing short of superb.  Veteran voice actors such as Dave Wittenberg, Michael McConnohie, Wendee Lee, and Michael Mercer play the parts of the main characters.  You may recognize some of these voice actors.  They have appeared in many of Namco-Bandai's video games.  Dave Wittenberg, for example, played Allen Ridgeley in the Xenosaga franchise.  And Michael McConnohie played Commander Margulis in the same franchise.  I highly recommend this movie.  And those bio-engineered weapons will really put chills in your spine!  The movie does a very good job of bringing the game's survival-horror atmosphere to the movie audience.",1352505600,,3553,5.086655112651647
5163774,5,B008H6GHL0,"Based on my experience with previous RE Degeneration movie and other CG films, I was expecting this to be a decent film at the most, but when I watched the whole film, I couldn't help but to love it.

Pros.

-Great Animation/Graphics: This is a must for CG films and like the last version Animation is wonderful and the city and scenes in the movie look great.

-Marvelous Character Design: Leon, Ada and other main characters are very well designed and the voice acting is decent.

-Amazing Action Sequences: This what I loved/surprised by the most. Fighting choreography is just mind-blowing. I was expecting some action but not this much. To me more the better. I would love to describe this in more, but can't do without spoiling.

-Acceptable Story: The plot for most part made sense. This is no Avatar, but is engaging enough to be entertaining.

Cons.

-The Ending: I truly wish they would have gone a step further and showed one more fight (won't spoil but if you see, you will know what I am talking about). The story feels incomplete because they don't show this one more fight and what happens to a mysterious character introduced in this film. I haven't played Resident Evil 6, so may be this has something to do with the movie leading into the game????

Contrary to the con I described the movie is enjoyable enough to be worth owning. I hope they make at least one more with Leon and Ada.",1352419200,,1402,4.557768924302789

5163777,5,B008H6GHL0,"This movie is a total fan-gasm for RE lovers. ""Damnation"" stars Leon S. Kennedy as he investigates a brewing bioterrorist attack in a small eastern European republic. And where you've got Leon, you've naturally gotta have Ada. Mirroring the video games, she surfaces every once in a while to provide Leon with some much-needed assistance. Hunnigan makes an appearance, too, but that's about it for canon characters.

The characters in ""Damnation"" are all very fleshed-out and easy to sympathize/empathize with. Leon's European allies, especially, are extremely likeable and genuine, *SPOILER ALERT* making it almost heartbreaking when a certain few of them succumb to the virus *END SPOILER ALERT*. Without a doubt, the multidimensional characters are brought to life by superb writing and voice acting.

""Damnation"" looks great. What more is there to say? Movements look fluid, facial expressions look natural, and textures look almost real.

If you're an RE fan (especially one with a bias toward Leon and Ada), then you won't regret seeing this film. At the very least, it will hold you over until Capcom releases more DLC for RE6.",1351987200,,1134,5.21978021978022

5163779,5,B008H6GHL0,"As someone who saw Resident Evil: Degeneration, this was a great continuation of the series.  The plot and characters were interesting, there was plenty of action, and the CGI was outstanding.  I highly recommend this movie to fans of anime and the Resident Evil franchise!",1351987200,,273,5.044444444444444
5163780,1,B008H6GHL0,the story line is very VERY!!!!! boring you will hate this movie bigtime im a fan and the only thing thats good is when the lickers fight the tyraunt,1351900800,,149,4.172413793103448
5163781,4,B008H6GHL0,"I didn't like so much the first movie, RE:Denegeneration. (see the other review)

But this movie redemeed that.

The plot is simple, but yet it fits in R.Evil universe. As a matter of fact, I prefer Svetlana than Saddler or Salazar (REvil 4). She does not that ""let's capture and make a mortal and complex device to kill to Batman""... I mean Leon!

(She is very much straighforward: just kill him! Although her soldiers are very much incompetente and could not manage to hit a single bullet in Leon.)

For boys, you will be pleased by two hot strong female characters in a ""cat fight"": the knife fight is better than Leon and Krauser.

If you are a girl - like me - you would be delighted to see Leon like he should be. Not a robot, but a human being with even a streak of sense of humour. Oh, and a scene that is meant for fangirls to fantasy about having him in their hands.

The mocap (motion capture) is really awesome. In Degeneration, only Claire was decently worked out - the rest, including Leon, seemed like Barbie dolls!

But now, the characters eyes are looking at the right plaece. Sometimes, I forgot they are virtual, not real people.

Even though, it is not perfect. But I guess it was an important experiment in order to make an even better mocap for the new game R.Evil 6.",1351728000,,1289,4.38655462184874
5163782,5,B008H6GHL0,I love this movie it's so awesome and Leon is so funny and awesome. Ada is as usually an awesome spy as much as I don't like her. It's an amazing movie it made Degeneration look like a kid's movie,1351641600,,196,3.925
5163783,3,B008H6GHL0,"Since Resident Evil: Damnation achieved a moderate success, the fellas at Capcom decided to do another fully-CGI movie. This one also ties into the continuity of the Resident Evil video games, and totally void of the Paul W.S. Anderson live-action franchise(thankfully!). It was animated by Capcom studios, and Digital Frontier which handles several Japanese live-action and anime movies.

Taking place sometime after the Resident Evil 5 game, zombie survivalist Leon Kennedy is sent into an unnamed Soviet country which is in the middle of a civil war to see if either side is using BOWs(Bio-Organic Weapons)such as the T-Virus. Leon is captured by the resistance and discover that they are using a new form Plaga that allows them to mentally control the wall-crawling Lickers. Meanwhile, RE femme fatale Ada Wong is posing as UN liasion to the country's female president Svetlana, but Ada is really working for a unknown source(more than likely to be revealed in Resident Evil 6. Leon's rebel buddies get taken down by the Plaga-infested zombies, and their remaining leader Alexander uses a Plaga to launch a Licker attack on the capitol. Svetlana's forces are unable to repel them, until she unleashes several of the giant Tyrant monsters on them. Leon and Alexander are ultimately saved by the combined American and Russian forces, which almost seems to make everything Leon went through entirely pointless if they were going to step in and take control of the country in the first place.

Damnation is a definate upgrade from Degeneration in as far as the action and animation, plus this one is actually Rated R so there's alot more blood for your buck. Storywise though, this doesn't have much of an impact on the given series, sorta like an anime movie based on an TV series like Naruto that acts an an outside filler arc. There's still very few actual ""zombies"" in this, although the showdown between the Tyrants and Lickers is a seriously cool fight. I'd recommend this for fans of the video games, or people who are just damn tired of Milla Jovovich and her Matrix bullcrap.",1351641600,5,2084,4.951428571428571
5163784,5,B008H6GHL0,"Comparing to the Resident Evil movies, the comics are definitely closer to the stories in the games, although it's still pretty different. The graphic in damnation is awesome. Honestly the last one (degeneration) had already surprised me but this easily beats it. Tyrants are great. Actually that's the correct way to put Tyrants as the final boss in anything related to Resident Evil.",1351555200,,385,5.126984126984127

8528021,5,B008H6GHL0,"If you love the Resident Evil games, lives up to expectations and more.

If you haven't played any RE games, I'd recommend playing through, at the very least, RE2 and RE4 at least: otherwise, the little moments that appeal to the fans will be lost on you, but it's not so easy to get into if you aren't familiar with the world.

The animation is better than the first movie with better looking models, a variety of environments, and awesome cinematography and action. Not only that, but the writing improved to with many witty retorts scattered throughout Leon's dialogue, great character to character interaction, and a caste of familiar faces and likable new characters.

To Resident Evil fans, I can't recommend this movie enough.",1517356800,,733,4.895161290322581

8528023,5,B008H6GHL0,pretty much better than 80% of re games it follow the traditional plots and honor the characters more than RE live action films but the story feel dragged out after awhile,1511740800,,171,4.548387096774194

8528025,4,B008H6GHL0,"I started my RE journey back in the day with RE2. I have played every game since.  When a resident evil movie was going to be made I was super excited.  When I actually saw the live action I was beyond disappointed.  Hollywood screwed up yet another game based movie.

This movie and its counterparts however do not dissapoint for a REAL RE\BH fan.  It continues the story from the game universe,  in a style that fits it, with actual characters from the games.

The animation is great and improved from RE: Degeneration, the film is dubbed in English so the lips look a tad off at times however they use the voice actors that you already know from the games.

This one takes place after RE4, so yeah Leon is a badass. There are familiar monsters from games and the evil corporations  you love to hate are here as well. Its an actual expansion of the established game universe.

After reading a few other reviews,  I am sure others probably didn't even know RE was a game.  If you are looking for the some garbage that Hollywood slapped together and threw Mila Jovovich in... This is not for you.",1508889600,,1096,4.425
