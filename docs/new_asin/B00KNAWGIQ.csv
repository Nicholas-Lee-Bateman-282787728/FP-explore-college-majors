8660267,4,B00KNAWGIQ,"Pretty good movie about a young German guy who meets a young Cambodian girl on holiday. I don't want to spoil any plot points, but I will say the acting is good throughout. It does a decent job of capturing life in Cambodia, with the exception of not showing the intense heat, which anyone from Germany would certainly be taken aback by. There are a few scenes that ring kind of hollow, as the movie stumbles a little in its third act. Kind of similar to the movie HOLLY, though nowhere near as good. I would highly recommend that movie, too.",1369094400,,542,4.376237623762377
