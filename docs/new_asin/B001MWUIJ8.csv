8322339,5,B001MWUIJ8,"best spent $19! It is not new, but still sickening to see how laws get written beyond our borders to protect corporate greed... We are used to corporate greed within our borders and playing with regulations to accommodate corporate abuse.. But one can never become used to seeing how far they are willing to go and how low they sink for that additional buck...  If they paid just half the attention to humans, the world would be a better place. But being poor today equates to being stripped of any rights.. dogs have more rights in some homes than these garment workers do... Still, I am glad that there are people in the federal system that would spend years to make these workers whole again.... We simply need more of them... because this is also happening right here in California and in NY... Consumers need to ask tough questions, that's what really scares corporations, certainly not the government.",1426291200,,907,4.7405063291139244
8322340,5,B001MWUIJ8,"I purchased this video to show my 9th grade World History students after discussing the Industrial Revolution. They were shocked to see that many of the abuses of workers that occurred during the I.R. still occur today. It's informative, interesting, and eye-opening. For a bunch of 13-14 year olds, it kept their attention and served as a great way to help connect our curriculum to today.",1329696000,4,390,4.924242424242424
8322341,5,B001MWUIJ8,This film was perfect for the classroom!  I was teaching a unit on the Industrial Revolution and my students did not seem to think that horrible working conditions still existed today. The video was just the right length to keep my students' interest.  I would recommend the film for everyone and for the classroom.  You will certainly shop differently after watching this film!,1322265600,2,378,4.968253968253968
8322342,5,B001MWUIJ8,"Behind the Labels is an outstanding piece of investigative reporting, revealing the dark secret of labor and immigration abuses in Saipan, United States Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  This is a story of unbridled corporate greed and the inhuman treatment of garment workers imported from Asia to Saipan to work in sweatshop garment factories.  The workers, principally from China and the Philippines, paid thousands of dollars for the chance to work in ""America"" -- not knowing that they would be sent to an island ghetto and deprived of dignity and the most basic freedoms.  Their compensation?  Less than one-half the minimum wage under United States law.  They were threatened with deportation if they disagreed with the whims of overseers and they experienced ""payless pay-days"" and loss of pay for the most minor of ""infractions,"" such as getting pregnant or taking one too many bathroom breaks.  They were subjected to piecework quotas under the most onerous working conditions.  They were forced to work off the clock if arbitrarily imposed quotas were not met and were routinely cheated out of overtime compensation mandated by U.S. labor laws.  Because of Saipan's unique status, U.S. immigration and labor laws did not apply on this U.S. territory.  Attempts at unionization were met with termination, deportation and threats of both, along with physical violence.  But this story is not without heroes.  Some brave garment workers stood up and demanded to be treated fairly and with a modicum of dignity.  Although things have changed for the better in Saipan since the making of this film in 2002, the evils that were allowed to exist there present a stunning picture of globalization and the anything-for-corporate-profit mentality that has marked its progression.  It is a story that repeats itself in poor countries around the world.  The difference here is that garments manufactured in Saipan sweatshops were permitted to be imported to the U.S. with a ""Made in the USA"" label.  Tia Lessin, the producer and director of this documentary, looked behind the labels and exposed a nightmare and an American disgrace.",1262649600,2,2145,5.2128279883381925
