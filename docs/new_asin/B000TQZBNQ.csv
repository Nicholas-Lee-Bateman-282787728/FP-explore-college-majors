2908838,5,B000TQZBNQ,"Hurray!  Warner Brothers is finally going to release season two of Cheyenne. I realize that the market for this western series may be limited, but has anyone noticed that there were close to 70 positive reviews of the first season?  That is more than a whole lot of recent, supposedly more popular television shows, of more recent vintage.  There is a large ""over 50"" market for this show and the WB people need to take advantage of it!

2908839,5,B000TQZBNQ,"I enjoyed the first season of Cheyenne on DVD. It brought back many memories of my youth.  I think that Clint Walker is a great cowboy actor and made the series very realistic in its portrayal of the old west.  I really look forward to the second season being released.  I hope it will be soon.  Pat S, USA",1191110400,19,306,4.135593220338983
2908840,5,B000TQZBNQ,"After the tremendous success of the first season's sales, Warner Brothers should not wait any longer and release the second season of this great Western series. Those of us who are old enough to have watched Cheyenne  are not getting any younger. Let's hope that season 2 has another interview with the great Clint Walker.

2908843,5,B000TQZBNQ,"The Cheyenne show is a fabulous trip to the Golden Age of television, to the days when the western genre was simple and pure, when manicheism was well established, good guys versus bad guys. We must urge Warner Bros. to release the second season of Cheyenne as soon as possible. The previous one was released on June 6, 06, so now it is the right time for a new release. The first season of Cheyenne was indeed very good, but the second one is much, much better in all aspects. Season one had only 15 episodes and each ran about 40 minutes each. Season two has 20 episodes running about 50 minutes each. The writing is much better for season two. The famous Cheyenne logo (Cheyenne's bust and the mountainous background)and the familiar theme song by William Lana & Stan Jones, both lacking in the first season, are largely featured starting with season two. The episodes also carry beautiful designs for the initial and final credits.
And finally a word about Clint Walker. He is a better actor in this season, proving that he was one of best western stars for television.
The second and third seasons of Cheyenne are the outstanding years of the show, a must to everybody that loved the great TV westerns of the 50s and 60s, and also a must to people that never had the opportunity to watch those fantastic and innocent shows of yesterday.
The episodes of the second season (1956/57)are as follow:
1  - The Dark Rider (guests: Diane Brewster, Myron Healey)
2  - The Long Winter
3  - Death Deals the Hand (guests: Leo Gordon, Arthur Hunnicut)
4  - The Bounty Killer (guest: Andrew Duggan)
5  - The Law Man
6  - The Mustang Trail (guest: Diane Brewster)
7  - Lone Gun (guests: Nancy Hale, Bob Steele)
8  - The Trap
9  - The Iron Trail (guest: Dennis Hopper)
10 - Land Beyond the Law (guest: Andrew Duggan)

14 - Big Ghost Basin (guest: Merry Anders)
15 - Born Bad

If you were entertained by season one of Cheyenne, the second season will cement your enjoyment of the show even more. Humor, romance, and mystery are delivered up with a myriad cast of characters revolving around Cheyenne Bodie, played with huge heart by the huge Clint Walker. This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Some of the standout episodes in my opinion are The Dark Rider, The Long Winter, Deadline, Big Ghost Basin and Decision at Gunsight.

2908911,1,B000TQZBNQ,"While I enjoyed season one, and liked Clint Walker, I am not a fan of DVD-R's.  The few I have purchased have had problems playing. Also, companies that produce this type of product have a bad habit of cutting episodes and sound tracks to cut their costs.  The second reason is the overwhelming price.  This is a 50year old series,  $40-$50 a season is ridiculous!  I won't pay that for a new series, why would I pay that for an old season?  As consumers, quality and price are paramount in any purchase.  Hopefully someone will read this and figure out that cheating consumers is not how to run a business.

2908929,5,B000TQZBNQ,"Cheyenne Bodie (Clint Walker) continues his travels and adventures in 20 Second-Season episodes (1956-7).  Cheyenne, he says, is the only first name I can remember having; his parents were killed in a wagon-train massacre, but apparently not by that tribe, which found him and took him in.  He has scouted for the Army during the Dakota campaign, been several times over the El-Paso-to-Yuma route, served as a deputy in Leadville and in Salmon City, Idaho, even done some mining, and at one point it's revealed that five years ago he was a greenhorn deputy in Tombstone.  He roams from Mexico (where he hunts mustangs) through Texas (he  has made four drives up the trail from there) to Montana (whence he takes a riverboat to St. Louis) and the Dakota Territory, and along the way clashes with crooked gamblers out to skin a friend of his, a ruthless woman who's out to get control of a silver mine, and a gang of vicious young train robbers who've decided to move a step up and kidnap the President, finds himself deputized by a lawman who turns out not to be of the bring-'em-back-alive persuasion,  struggles to clear his name after being accused of murder, does counterintelligence for the Army, comes to the aid of a couple working a gold claim in Sioux country, works as a stock detective for a Colorado Cattlemen's Protective Association and a special agent for the Indian Bureau, traps fur, and tries to avert an Indian war when a gold-miner accuses the Sioux of killing one of his partnersan attempt complicated by an Eastern newspaperwoman determined to get a story.

Most of the stories carry no specific date, but those that do tend to be slightly confusing: in The Iron Road Grant is President and Custer's Last Stand is spoken of in past tense, yet Cheyenne says he once saw Billy Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid in action (Billy, who lived 1859-81, didn't really gain a name until August of '77, when he killed his first man, and by that time Grant was out of office); Test of Courage likewise mentions the Custer fight as a recent occurrence, but The Broken Pledge (the final episode of the season) finds Custer still alive and Little Big Horn not yet fought.  One of the best segments in the set is Born Bad, featuring Robert F. Simon as a veteran sheriff who has spent six of the last 20 years hiding a terrible secret: his only son, the twin of his beloved daughter, is an outlaw.  It's Cheyenne who serves as the catalyst: when the youngster rifles his trapping cabin, he pursues him, wounds him from a distance, and drives him to seek sanctuary from his father.  This results in Cheyenne being appointed temporary sheriff when the distraught father decides he has no option but to resign his officeand staying on for three months, during which time he and the daughter seem to be, at least, on the very edge of falling in love.  (Interestingly, he mentions in an earlier segment that he was in love oncewhich, given the data above, suggests that the stories of his adventures are being told out of sequence.  This is supported by his line in Pledge that he's never seen a woman rigged out man-fashion (i.e., in pants)but in fact he does in Hard Bargain, broadcast just before.)  In The Brand, while trying to track down a missing friend, Cheyenne encounters the three children of a notorious outlaw, whose oldest son seems bent on following in his footsteps all the way to the gallowswhich, in turn, has inspired a case of terminal hero-worship in his kid brother.  Big Ghost Basin turns on a mysterious thingit leaves tracks even the Indian-trained Bodie can't recognizethat roams the basin of the title, killing anyone it finds out after dark.  Then there's The Long Winter, in which we have the treat of seeing Cheyenne riding a mule about two sizes too small for him, and The Spanish Grant, with Anthony George thoroughly charming as the Mexican ranchero/bandidio with whom Cheyenne makes common cause to regain an infant's rightful inheritance.

Guest stars include such stalwarts of the era as Myron Healey, Fay Spain, Hayden Rorke, Stacy Keach, Arthur Hunnicutt, Dan Blocker, Dennis Hopper, Sheb Woolley, Eddie Little Sky (billed as Eddie Little), James Griffith, Rhodes Reason, Paul Brinegar, Bob Steele, Angie Dickinson, James Garner (in a heavy role), Michael Pate, Slim Pickens, Arrthur Kennedy, Peggie Castle, Frank Ferguson, John Carradine, Marie Windsor, Richard Crenna, Regis Toomey, Frank deKova, Whit Bissell (as General Custer!), Iron Eyes Cody (uncredited), Stuart Randall (playing a sheriff, as usual), several who fill two different roles (Diane Brewster, Andrew Duggan, Hal Baylor, Robert J. Wilkie, William Fawcett), Peggie Castle making a return appearance from the previous season, and Edward Byrnes (later Edd, and best known as Kookie, the cult heartthrob on 77 Sunset Strip).  Some of the scripts are credited as being from stories by Bennett Foster, Steve Frazee, Noel M. Loomis, and Harry Sinclair Dragoall well-known Western novelists of the day, which gives you some idea of their quality.",1420156800,6,5049,4.880841121495327

2908961,5,B000TQZBNQ,"I have the ""Cheyenne"" collection series of the first, second, third and fourth season and I must say that in my opinion, the second season is by far the best season. I admit that I have not seen the fifth or six season but by then most of the storylines start to decline in quality and originality due to the fact that the writers have to keep churning out future episodes for upcoming seasons and fresh ideas, material and new storylines start to wear thin. The writing, the directing, the storylines, the panoramic scenes of the old west as well as the superb acting by the supporting actors has made this the best season. Guest stars who appear on this DVD set as well as appearing on the other seasons, are a staple to the TV western genre, and do a great job as supporting cast. Robert J. Wilke was a great character actor who appeared frequently on the Cheyenne series, sometimes as a villain but other times as a ""good guy."" The price for this collection is not bad considering that it contains 22 episodes, and many of the episodes are as good in quality as many of those 70 to 80 minute black-and-white movie westerns abundant in the 40s and 50s. When I was a boy about seven or eight years of age, I remember watching the ""Monster of the Basin"" episode which I remember was the title of this episode then, but watching this episode almost 50 years later it was probably renamed or the original title was probably the ""Ghost of the Basin."" Those two glaring shining eyes watching at you in the dark surely scared my brother and me! In fact, when I bought this season 2 the first episode that I watched was the ""Ghost of the basin.""

The only seasons *without* scratched DVDs was the first season, but those are proper pressed DVDs that evidently come from a different sort of manufacturing/packaging line than these crappy MOD DVD-Rs that Warner loves so much.

The same thing occurred with the first season of Maverick. The episodes are in sharp black and white and seem more carefully made then some of todays TV productions. Clint Walker gives an effective mix of toughness and gentleness and makes an impressive hero. Cheyenne was always my favourite of the Warner Brothers TV westerns and seems just as entertaining today. One particularly unusual episode is ""Big Ghost Basin"" in which a monstrous beast is at large. It reminded me of the plot of a monster movie, even thought the creature turns out to be conventional. There is a good variety of stories in this second season with Cheyenne in different jobs and settings and of course early appearances from familiar faces such as Dennis Hopper and James Garner. So Cheyenne as your song says, ""Where will you be camping tonight?""",1366502400,,964,4.813253012048193

For instance, Sugarfoot, why hasn't this program been included. There are some episodes of Maverick, but I'm not sure if that program has been produced in its entirety. There is one episode of Sugarfoot available which is included in a compilation of  TV westerns, but it is the only one.

The series' of that time period did not have gratuitous sex, graphic violence, and generally had a moral.  Cheyenne had principles, not the all too typical anti-hero, live for today, get what you can for yourself now, attitude of many TV characters of today. And don't get me started on what passes for comedy. Cheyennes' storylines were varied, though western themed, and evidenced much better writing than many today, suitable for whole-family viewing, with more actual minutes in an ""hour"" show that today's constant interruptions for commercials.  This in spite of many more episodes in one season than today's with their many reruns after a month or more into a new season.  A different era.",1302825600,4,839,4.921985815602837

While it's fun to see well known actors at the starts of their careers, it's great to see the three great villains of western cinema (Jack Elam, Lee van Cleef, and Robert J. Wilke) on this and other Warner Brothers westerns.

Just remember that some companies have discontinued publishing DVD format of a TV series without warning! I didn't know if they were going to continue to bring forth any further Cheyenne episodes! The quality of the format is really good. I also enjoyed finally hearing the song ""Cheyenne"" and seeing the Cheyenne famous drawing that I remember the series by when I was a kid.

It is in 2 volumes (5 discs each), but both parts are currently available and all 20 episodes of the season are reproduced in high quality. This is the best season of Cheyenne (season 3 is also in the same level) and it is a must to all western fans and to people who watched television in the 50s and 60s. It was originally aired from September 11, 56 thru June 4, 57. These episodes have many important guest stars, people now retired or deceased: James Garner, Angie Dickinson, Peggie Castle, Ruchard Crenna, Merry Anders, Dennis Hoppe, Edward Byrnes, John Carradine, etc.
Hollywood was really unfair to Clint Walker. He was underestimated as an actor. Today, when we watch the Cheyenne series, or Fort Dobbs, or Yellowstone Kelly, or Gold of the Seven Saints, we can see how good he was when portraing a westerner. I don't think he could have done well in soap operas or in any Shakespearean drama, but in western movies he was perfect, as good as John Wayne, Gary Cooper or Randolph Scott. Clint certainly deserved a better chance in Hollywood in the old days, when the western genre was still alive.

And Clint Walker makes it work because he is an honest actor that always gave us our money's worth. Cheyenne was an adult western that any age group could watch be entertained and has many lessons about doing the right thing that a man would do. I love to watch it with my 11 and 13 year old boys for that reason. We really have no good role models on Tv anymore except for perhaps Jack Bauer. Anyway may long live Clint Walker and please bring on Cheyenne 2nd season in time for Christmas 08.

The man deserved so much more than Hollywood offered !!  He was ""too good"" for them and we have been deprived of one of the most beautiful voices created...that's my take on Mr. Norman Eugene Walker, aka Clint Walker/Cheyenne'......",1481068800,6,557,4.914893617021277
