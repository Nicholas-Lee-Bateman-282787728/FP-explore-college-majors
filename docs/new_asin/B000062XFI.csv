1685206,5,B000062XFI,"Oops!  I got edited... I chose that subject heading because that was the title that the director guy in the book of this movie wanted to call the movie that the character in the book wrote the script for. Confused? Sorry, there's no need to be. Just watch the movie and read Ben Elton's 'Inconceivable' like I did and it will all make sense!!
This movie displayed fantastic English humour as well as touching romance. Not to mention tackling the sensitive subject of Infertility. You find yourself laughing at the fact that Hugh Laurie's Sam has to shove a container of man juice up his bottom to keep it warm, yet at the same time, you feel sad because no matter what they put themselves through, Sam and Lucy just can't seem to get pregnant. And to make matters worse, ignorant old Sam isn't giving Lucy the attention she deserves!!
Hugh Laurie was absolutely gorgeous and Joely Richardson was stunning. It was funny yet sad, and seemed to present both a bloke's and a woman's point of view in the most honest of ways. I felt all fuzzy and lovey towards my partner afterwards, and I think it would probably have that effect mainly on people who are in a long-term relationship.
The one-liners are brilliant and there are cameos from a few great English actors that we all know and love.
What can I say? I love it! I had a tear and a giggle.",1044489600,12,1342,4.455284552845528
1685207,5,B000062XFI,I ordered this movie on Pay Per View cable tv. because of the fact that James Purefoy was in it...never expecting it to be so well done and...Funny! It was one of ny first experiences with British comedy and I was extremely pleased not only with Mr. Purefoy's performance but also the entire cast. if you are looking for an off the wall comedy..this is it!,1026691200,9,356,4.409090909090909
1685208,3,B000062XFI,"The performances are good...I liked Ewan Proclaimer.  The jokes in the movie are sometimes oddly placed and sometimes the flow of the movie gets interrupted, like the bit about the dog turd in the park.  It also contains one of those lines I never thought I would ever hear.  Rowan Atkinson is probably the best in the film, even though his performance reeks of Blackadder.  I suppose that is acceptable here, since this was written by Ben Elton and stars the Honourable Lieutenant George Colthurst St. Barleigh himself.",1026259200,10,520,4.875
1685209,5,B000062XFI,"My wife and I watched this film last night and were in tears a number of times, laughing the rest. The reason? This is the absolute best depiction of infertility we've ever seen on the screen or on television, and, seeing as we have the same problems, it struck a chord with us.
The IMDB reviews on this film are horrid, as most people don't seem to understand that the infertility issue does to people exactly what this film depicts.
I can't recommend this film highly enough, especially if you are having the same difficulties conceiving a child. You'll laugh at the bittersweet humor and cry at all the appropriate places, as you see yourselves on the screen.",1024012800,4,662,4.61864406779661
1685210,1,B000062XFI,"Okay, I like British rom-coms as much as the next person, but this one was just tasteless and stupid.  I like Joelly Richardson, but she was just annoying here.  I like Hugh Laurie, but he couldn't save it.  And if I ever walked into a clinic that contained such scary staff as Rowan Atkinson's gyneacologist or Dawn French's deranged nurse, I would walk right out again immediately.
We are not spared the tiniest detail of Hugh and Joelly's bid for a baby, and in some cases, a little information goes a long way.  Besides, Joelly's character would make a horrible mother; she's so  paranoid and possesive.  Also, she constantly whines to her husband that he'd rather be having sex with Cameran Diaz, which is a stupid thing to say given that she has more than a passing resemblance to Diaz herself.  The best thing about this lame and squirmy movie is the ever-watchable Tom Hollander, who hams it up nicely with a preposterous Scottish accent as Ewan Proclaimer, a hilarious director.",1023667200,7,987,4.7368421052631575
1685211,5,B000062XFI,"I brought this video when it first came out in the shops in the UK (last year) and every time I see it I laugh.
The acting is so real, emotions streaming.
Well, all it is about really is a couple trying for a baby. They try to conceive but don't know why the wife (Lucy) is not pregnant.
Sam (husband) works for the BBC and is in desperate attempt to write a film to show his boss that he is an artist.
He gets the idea of writing a film on their problems trying to conceive. But this doesn't go down too well with Lucy.
But guess what?
He does it anyway.
This video is a brillint comedy and it is great for a laugh. Rated a Certificate 15 in UK.
Have fun watching.",1014681600,3,665,3.933333333333333
1685212,4,B000062XFI,"I actually saw this film last year in Australia, and the reason for watching it was a radio interview I heard with the author, Ben Elton. He's a british Stand-Up comedian, a writer, an actor and producer. And he's FUNNY! The story of the film has many autobiographical elements, because Elton and his wife went through the pains of infertility, after discovering that the effort of using contraceptives for years and years was completely useless! Hugh Laurie and Joley Richardson play the couple in an extraordinarily funny way, the story is good and it's told good. I definitely liked the movie, and when it's shown in the US eventually, I will go and see it again.",994204800,6,666,4.75
1685213,5,B000062XFI,I bought this movie because I love Hugh Laurie on House. He is the most talented actor I have ever seen. He is so funny in this movie. I think he is the most talented actor and gives every thing to the role that his does. He is also very hot and sexy!,1278028800,,251,3.7547169811320753

1685215,5,B000062XFI,"I laughed, I cried it was better than Cats!

Seriously, these characters were made for each other.  You felt for them both through every aspect of the movie.  Hugh Laurie was brilliant, and Joely Richardson was stunning.  I'm glad I got the British version, I laughed myself silly and found myself yelling at the tv.... silly American, they can't HEAR YOU!!!

I highly recommend this movie!  Fantastically made!",1239062400,,411,4.970588235294118
1685216,3,B000062XFI,"The movie was ok, but I had really expected more out of it because it starred two actors from two of my favorite TV shows (Nip/Tuck & House.",1229385600,,140,4.035714285714286
1685217,1,B000062XFI,"I adore Hugh Laurie. House is one of my favorite TV shows and I loved his portrayal of Bertie Wooster. So I ordered this sight unseen. HL's in it, it's gotta be great, right? Wrong. The ""humor"" is grotesque and unfunny and the story is totally unsatisfying. What a waste of Emma Thompson, too. I think this is the worst British movie I've ever seen.",1217894400,5,349,4.384615384615385
1685218,3,B000062XFI,"Somewhat good comedy/drama, with the drama part being unable to deliver, about a couple trying to conceive. Hugh Laurie is really good playing the husband Sam. He is funny, entertaining, and delivers on all his comedy scenes. The husband decides to write a script about the couple's ordeal of going through the process of conceiving. Joely Richardson is...well, delivering lines. Her acting felt more like she was reading lines rather than acting. Anyways, her character has to deal with the temptation of being with another man and also the process of trying to conceive. The movie was somewhat entertaining until my roommate asked me: ""If this is a comedy, why are you not laughing?"". Why indeed? The movie is actually not that funny with exception of Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson playing a very funny new age character. Rowan Atchinson (Mr. Bean) also appears.",1211846400,,864,5.006944444444445
1685219,3,B000062XFI,"I loved this movie when I first saw it, and I was so excited when I got the DVD that I watched it immediately. And it was good, but I started to feel like I was missing chunks of the movie, like parts had been taken out. Turns  out there were.

In the original cut, there is a lot more humor, a lot more sex, and a lot more Britishness. The 104 minute movie has been scaled down to a 93 minute knock off that glosses over the difficult and complex ending with a shoddy voice over, cuts out the entire subplot of Lucy's affair, and removes the sex not suited for American audiences. I was disappointed with this film.

The original is stellar if you can find it, just be forewarned that you will be missing out if you get this version.",1203379200,10,734,4.118881118881119
1685220,1,B000062XFI,"In most civilized countries, Maybe Baby would be banned as cruel and unusual punishment. Disproving the old adage about writing what you know, Ben Elton's horrendously arch comedy about infertility shows that only works when what you know is remotely interesting or convincing. Long before the half hour mark you'll be praying that these people be prevented from ever breeding. A string of DOA one-liners delivered by hideously OTT Britcom TV stars, Elton's direction is even worse than his script - he seems to think that because the screen is bigger than his usual sitcom turf the performances have to be too. Hugh Laurie, Adrian Lester and James Purefoy aside, it's a parade of excruciatingly unconvincing media stereotypes delivered at full volume for maximum pain, whether it's Joely Richardson proving that talent is not hereditary and demonstrating the comic timing of a whelk (and this is one of her better performances) or Rachel Stirling continuing her quest to prove herself as Britain's worst actress. There is one good tirade against bad British movies, but it falls somewhat flat in something that is, on its own terms, even worse than what it supposedly rails against.

Although this US version is cut by 10 minutes from the original UK cut, it's hard to get upset when the film was so poor to begin with.",1202515200,,1320,4.945945945945946
1685221,2,B000062XFI,"Reviewers who have watched the Region 2 DVD version of this film insist that the 10 additional minutes in that version make all the difference. This version misses the mark. How could it miss with Ben Elton writing and directing and Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson in the lead roles? Answer: it skips the process that the couple needs to go through to come to some peace with their situation. One scene ""all is lost"" and ""presto chango"" in the next is all resolved. This leaves the main characters as card board cutouts for a comic plot. Still its worth watching for the stylish send ups of the BBC, modern London, and some very funny scenes. Richardson is dazzlingly georgeous and Laurie is charming and wonderful. Laurie's sperm-test song is a keeper. Just don't expect that touching moment that make every thing work--someone, somewhere, somehow forgot to write, shoot, or include it in this version. But, oh would I love to see the Region 2 version! Explain to me why in the world Amazon doesn't sell it on the U.S. website???",1198022400,3,1031,4.701657458563536
1685222,5,B000062XFI,"This well-written, well-acted movie is sure to please.  Hugh Laurie is endearing as a bumbling but genuinely loving husband of a wife who desperately wants a baby but can't get pregnant.  You need not to have experienced fertility problems to understand the humor created by the pretty Joely Richardson visiting the hysterically offensive OB-GYN played by the outrageous Rowan Atkinson.  The real star of the film, however, is the gifted and gorgeous James Purefoy. His character takes a shine to Richardson's, tempting her to escape marital and reproductive misery in favor of sexual bliss.  The highlight of the film truly is Purefoy's recitation of Shakespeare's 18th sonnet, which reveals the actor's classic training.  The average female viewer is left wondering about the decision making skills of Richardson's character.  After all, a woman can always pregnant, but how many times in her life does she get the chance to sleep with James Purefoy?",1192406400,2,952,5.230263157894737
1685223,5,B000062XFI,this is a very funny and sweet movie with a bit of drama in the mix. Ben Elton wrote it very well and Hugh Laurie's performance is brilliant! oh and that body is not bad either lol,1190419200,3,180,3.891891891891892
1685224,3,B000062XFI,"If you are deciding to buy this... the advice I can give you is buy it if you are truly a fan of Hugh Laurie, it's a nice movie to add to your collection. Despite the fact that this movie is not Ben Elton's best work, but, I think you will get the kicks out of seeing Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, and not to mention, Rowan Atkinson, because these people are the reason why the movie is so alive and entertaining. Otherwise, the movie is so-so. Now to the DVD itself; this DVD version is highly-edited, I know that some scenes in the beginning of the movie are left out. I'm, somewhat disappointed with it. I guess you buyers can decide for yourself if it's worth buying, I hope this helps",1187222400,4,687,4.251908396946565
1685225,1,B000062XFI,"I love British comedy.  I, in fact, was having a conversation with a friend yesterday mentioning that the big difference between American comedy and British is the fact that they believe in more wit than physical humor.  I love the humor of  the BBC version of ""The Office"" as well as ""Black Books"" or ""Vicar of Dibley"" because instead of body humor or slapstick, they use their minds and command of the language.  Rowan Atkinson is an exception, but his humor defies all boundaries.  This is the reason I find myself enjoying less and less of what the major networks release, and focusing on what the BBC has to offer.  I just finished watching a great series called ""Clatterford"", which is as dry as many martinis, but still a breath of fresh air compared to things like, ""Notes from the Underbelly"", Everybody Loves Raymond"", or ""The Real Wedding Crashers"" (I realize the last doesn't quite fit, but I still need to include it among America's finest).  So, when it was presented to me to watch a BBC film release staring some of Britain's finest like Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, Dawn French, and, my favorite, Rowan Atkinson - I jumped at the chance.  I had seen through ""Nine Months"" how America took over pregnancy, now I wanted to see how the BBC would do it.  Alas, folks, all I can mention is how I wish some form of contraceptive, coupled with pain killers, were used to foil the plot and dull the pain.

""Maybe Baby"" had quite a bit of potential - let me quickly list them off - a cast that is dynamite when it comes to comedy; a story that had the potential to be quite humorous, hysterical in fact; the parody of Danny Boyle could have been blown up considerably - adding to the goofiness of the plot; and finally, let me add, the cast again - Emma Thompson, Rowan Atkinson, Dawn French, and Hugh Laurie are some of the best that Britain has to offer and are typically guaranteed to make anyone in their right mind laugh.  This said, why did this film hit the ground at the fastest speed possible thoroughly, and painfully, hurting everyone in it's path.  ""Maybe Baby"" is quite possibly one of the worst films that I have seen this year because it is the biggest disappointment with such potential that I have ever witnessed.  Our story is simple to write down, but on screen it is utterly disastrous.  The BBC wants to be more cutting edge, Sam and Lucy want children but cannot conceive (does anyone see the humor yet), so we combine the pair.  Sam begins writing about his life with his wife, the trials and tribulations of medically attempting to conceive, mixed with funny jokes that somehow only make the cast members laugh.  Lucy finds out the truth, Sam grows a beard, and the end - well, is everything one would expect from an American romantic comedy.  No surprises.  No laughter.  No excitement.  Overall, I have discovered an American Hollywood film trying to pass as British intelligence.  I call it The ""Maybe Baby"" Conspiracy.

I would like to begin this very negative review by saying Joely Richardson is by far one of the worst actresses I have witnessed in film.  Maybe I haven't seen enough of her work to make that sort of comment, but after seeing ""Maybe Baby"", I feel confident in my response.  Every scene was nothing but script reading and comic mis-timing.  Nothing coming from her mouth seemed worth repeating or re-watching.  She played the role of dumb blonde very, embarrassing, well.  The scenes in which she has to show emotion was like watching cardboard try to cry, and that is not an over exaggeration.  She attempts to show us a relationship with Sam (Hugh Laurie), but instead of a chemical romance, they seem to be enjoying the role of two actors playing a role.  There is nothing to evoke emotion between the two of them.  I didn't even think they were in ""love"" by the end of the film, they were a relationship of convenience and comfort.  BEWARE!  I need to add this about the remainder of the acting because this film may be misleading - Emma Thompson is in it for about three minutes, adding nothing of value or humor to the overall twist of the plot.  Rowan Atkinson is a refreshing snack, but like everyone else, adds no meat to the film (it reminded me of Robin Williams in ""Nine Months"").  Then there is Dawn French - don't get me started here because it remains pitiful and a waste of talent.  Coupled with the stagnet portrayals from the surrounding cast it just becomes a very painful moment in cinema as each minute passes.

The plot is devastating.  With a clich storyline we already know how it will end and what the characters will be doing/reacting before they probably do, I would hope the typical British wit would resonate strongly with the actor's dialogue.  That, alas, is missing from this film.  We are bombarded with characters that care nothing about money, are emotionless unless forced to be, and driven by no inner motivation outside of the paycheck.  The lyrics to this film are even painful.  There were no funny, punny, or laughable moments throughout the course of this film, which irritated me to no end.  With such a bold cast, I wanted to be rolling on the floor with hysterics, but alas, nothing happened.  The stale emotion translated well into the stale voice being heard from each of the voided characters.  I wanted charm, wit, talent, and appeal with this film.  I wanted to prove that American dictatorship over film hadn't leaked into the BBC mainstream, but again - I couldn't believe that I was that wrong.

""Trainspotting"" is a film that defined a nation and brought a new wave of cinema into our theaters.  I don't think a horrid film like ""Maybe Baby"" has the right to poke fun at it.  I don't mind intelligent hobnobbery, but with this film it was just plain rude to Danny Boyle.

Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone even the most bland of comedy fans.  Remember, if you choose to pick up this vile cinematic sludge, this is pre- ""House"" days, so do not see Laurie as what we Americans have come to expect from him.  ""Maybe Baby"" is too big for its britches, as it tries to pack too much comedy into a nothingless film - thus transforming the comedy into a forgettable piece of garbage.  There was nothing of value in this film, and while director Ben Elton has made his name in ""Blackadder"", I don't believe he has remembered much of his upbringing.  After seeing this film, I would have to advise Elton to avoid working behind the cameras ever again.  This was a very big disappointment for me as I had big hopes for this little film with big names.

The subtitle for this film should be: Never Judge A DVD By Its Cover.

1685226,4,B000062XFI,"I've become a Hugh Laurie fan since I started watching House, and I was interested in his earlier work.  My disappoinment comes from finding out the extent of the editing from the British version to the American version.  Right now, I couldn't have played the Region 2 version because I have a standard DVR, but I do plan to upgrade soon, and I resent the fact that if I want to see the ""complete"" movie (with features, which were NOT included in the Region 1 version) I'll have to buy the other version.  It's as though the House DVD's sold in Britain were missing an episode for each season.  In other words, a truly stupid idea.  As far as the actual content of the movie, it is cute, and some of it is downright funny (especially Dawn French and Rowan Atkinson).  The ""dramatic"" parts are a little overwrought (the Hugh Laurie character supposedly ""betrays"" the Joely Richardson character by secretly making a movie about the couple's fertility struggles, but she is so obssessive in her child quest that you wind up feeling sorry for HIM).  Who knows?  Maybe the less edited (i.e., British) version makes more dramatic sense, but I won't know unless I buy it, will I?!?",1179792000,2,1174,4.610576923076923

1685230,5,B000062XFI,"Okay, I'll admit it.  I bought this movie mainly because it starred Hugh Laurie.  I am a major Hugh Laurie fan which only happened after I discovered him in the TV series ""House"".  Now I can't get enough of this trememdously talented and very sexy actor/comedian.  I honestly wasn't even expecting much from this movie since I'd never heard of it, and I figured it was going to be a bomb that would, if nothing else, give me a couple of hours of seeing Hugh Laurie.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Not only did this movie keep me laughing throughout, but the entire cast is wonderful.  Laurie gives an outstanding performance as the insecure script writer desperately trying to conceive a baby with his wife, played by Joely Richardson who also deserves much praise for her performance.  Their relationship, though strained at times, is one of total love and devotion that is put to the test more than once by both partners.  The clever and often hysterical banter between the two is laugh out loud funny.  Rowan Atkinson, a/k/a Mr. Bean, plays Richardson's gynecologist with his usual quirky, off-the-wall style.  The actor who plays the director of Laurie's movie about their baby-making experiences (which he is having made without his wife's knowledge) will have you rolling on the floor laughing.  And, of course, there are a few tear-jerking moments here and there, but overall the movie is just plain funny.  I'm glad I discovered Hugh Laurie or I may never have seen this wonderful movie.  I highly recommend it, especially for anyone who just wants to see a fun movie or for any Hugh Laurie fan because you will see a lot of him and his piercing blue eyes in this film.",1124582400,67,1686,4.709897610921502

I loved the way Sam and Lucy's marriage is depicted in this film. There's something instantly endearing about these two, and you just want to follow along in their (at times hilarious, at times gut-wrenchingly-sad) attempts to conceive a child. This movie is written in a way that really allows you to become (perhaps reluctantly) emotionally invested in the two main characters (perfectly captured by Richardson and Laurie). I also found myself completely enamored by Hugh Laurie, not because I thought he blatantly good looking or something, but because I really felt for him as the devoted but imperfect husband. I later stumbled on to the fact that Laurie played the equally haughty and attractive Mr. Palmer in another one of my favorite films -- Sense and Sensibility.
