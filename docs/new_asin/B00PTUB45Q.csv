6821651,5,B00PTUB45Q,Interesting concept and great animation style,1425600000,,45,6.666666666666667
6821652,5,B00PTUB45Q,"I won't deny that, going into Outbreak Company during its original Japanese television broadcast, I expected the worst. Everything about the available synopses online pointed towards this being a one-dimensional, self-insert anime with stereotypical leads and grating harem nonsense. Boy howdy, did I get proven wrong. I can still taste toe jam.

While certainly not devoid of some mild harem silliness and brief fanservice, this show goes about its overcooked boilerplate concept with surprising intelligence, with much time spent on the political and social intricacies inherent in Eldant culture. The characters are also great, with each one being their presented stereotype in appearance only. Shinichi (the supposed ""plain Jane protagonist"") shows himself to be quite intelligent and resourceful, Petralka (the supposed ""abrasive tsundere"") is more than willing to listen to people and come to understandings without resorting to violence, and Myucel (the supposed ""shrinking violet maid girl"") -- bizarre as it sounds -- is a war veteran with adept learning skills and powerful magical capabilities. Each of these fleshed out characters work in tandem with their situations and each other to really bring this show to being great.

If you're not a fan of anime prior, though, I can't say you'll find much to enjoy right off. This show is very reference-heavy, so a mild familiarity with anime culture is required for full enjoyment. But if that doesn't deter you, then you should definitely pick this up.",1423094400,30,1510,5.367088607594937
6821653,3,B00PTUB45Q,"Shinichi Kanou is an otaku in search of a job. And he thinks he might have found one when he takes an interview test that tests his knowledge of anime, video games, and manga. But just after meeting with his new employer, he is drugged, kidnapped, and taken to another world. He awakens to find himself in an otakus dream - laying in large four poster bed with a lovely young maid standing by ready to serve him. Then he learns he has been chosen - chosen to bring otaku culture to this world were elves and magic and moe maids all exist. How could he say no to that?

This was a surprisingly entertaining show. There are a bunch of anime stereotypes, the loyal maid, the loli tsundere empress, the large breasted beast girl, but they all fit here, because this is a story about otaku after all. And Kanou seems to recognize this. Even better, he recognizes this but realizes that despite similarities, he isn't really in an anime (but he is. oh well). The scene where he finds out Myuseru is a half elf and is totally ecstatic, then she tells him that half elves are discriminated against, shows this pretty well. He may think it awesome, but the world doesnt share his opinion and he decides to change that.

It is interesting to see how they try to handle bringing otaku culture to a world that has technology on par with the Middle Ages. And even if they rig up a projector with the translated subtitles, how are they going to handle the literacy problem?

Outbreak Company juggles actual thoughtful concerns and problems, with totally ridiculous and wacky events (mostly the latter). A soccer match between elves and dwarfs? A school that actually holds classes to teach about otaku culture? A lesson on yaoi terms given to 10 year olds?

This is really a show designed for anime fans and anime fans are the ones who will enjoy it the most. The ending plot was something I saw coming a mile away and hoped wouldnt get any closer, but yes, they did it anyway. It ended the show on a sour note for me. It isn't a horrible ending, just kind of disappointing. For me it dropped the show from 4 stars to 3.

Still, it was fun.",1416355200,13,2126,4.413265306122449
6821654,4,B00PTUB45Q,"This is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand this short series will surprise you in a number of ways; on the other hand some of those surprises just don't work, especially in the very limited time (just 12 episodes) offered them.

The hero, Shinichi Kano, is a classic otaku hikikomori who in a desperate attempt to escape the dismal shut-in lifestyle he has fallen into, applies for a job he appears perfectly suited for, is hired, drugged, and kidnapped to the Eldant Empire where he learns that his true employer is the Japanese government and that his true job is the spreading of otaku culture into a tolkienesque, medieval land that looks like it belongs in an anime/manga.

In other words it is the perfect, dream job for him, and what follows is an intriguing mixture of fanboy lunacy and expertise crossed with some surprisingly serious political commentary and deadly intrigue.  One of the things I've had to get used to in anime and manga is the surprisingly wide gap between silly and serious contained within the same story, and in this series it is carried to such extremes that it will shock you.  To take just a few examples his JSDF bodyguard Minori Koganuma alternates clothing and antiperspirant spray accidents and fujoshi extremes with the deadly serious determination to keep this idiot alive through anything (unless she chooses to kill him herself), almost embarrassingly subservient half-elf maid Myucel Foaran is a former soldier who takes self-sacrificing courage to life ending levels, Empress Petralka Anne Eldant III displays an almost comical tsundere nature based upon one of the most gruesome succession histories I've ever heard of, and Erbia Hanaiman is a werewolf character played mostly for laughs who is introduced as a possible spy for a neighboring kingdom, which she may well be, and it falls to Shinichi to find someway to save her because the Eldant Kingdom's normal procedure would be to torture and execute her, whether she's guilty of anything or not!

What follows are ""friendly"" sporting and swimsuit episodes alternating with terrorist attack and climactic surprise episodes that will jerk you back and forth before the prolific otaku references to parodies and other things the Japanese director and voice actors worked on have you rerunning the numerous subtitles in order to understand what most of the jokes are about.  (True Otakus who already know without reading the subtitles may wish to add a star.)

Note: Intriguing similarities to ""Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There!"" are more than obvious, though from the opposite political POV, making me wonder if there was any action/reaction in the original novels.",1473811200,,2670,5.024886877828054
6821655,4,B00PTUB45Q,I can say this series was great with a whole lot of potential and episode 8 of this series got to me and shows what it's like when dealing with a hikikomori.  Raal life version is way worse especially in this day and age..,1470182400,,222,4.045454545454546
6821656,5,B00PTUB45Q,"So there is some ecchi and a little bit of fan service (always used in a comedic way), but what will surprise you about this anime is the amazing story! You really care about the characters by the end. Oh and you don't have to be a hardcore anime fan to enjoy this. Subtitles tell you where the obscure anime references come from. I'm a huge anime fan and I didn't know all the references and that in NO WAY took anything away from the show. Also this mess is funny, warm and positive, the show makes fun of itself constantly. The series is 12 episodes long and each episode really moves the story along so it is defiantly the right length. I really recommend this easy to watch and enjoyable anime (that doesn't have a crap ending LOL! :D

P.S. The animation is great and if you want to know the story? Read the summary on this page. :) The trailer (on youtube.com) doesn't tell you anything about the show.",1464739200,,908,4.309941520467836

6821659,3,B00PTUB45Q,"Good comedy, meh romance, and terrible action, are what I have taken away from this. The series is about a boy from Japan introducing anime and manga to a parallel fantasy world. An issue that I have are there being too many jokes explained with translation notes. These notes sometimes pop-up before the joke is even said, it's like the translation notes are the heckler at a comedy club that finishes a comedians joke before he has the chance to even set it up.  The dub cast for the most part are fine, however the ear grating voice talent of Kira Vincent as Petralka makes the dub nearly impossible to watch. She has done good voice work in other series, but from what I have watched young female characters should not be in her range.

The episode setup on the discs are somewhat of a conundrum. It has nine episodes on one disc and four on the other... Six and Six would make much more sense, but that is just me.",1448668800,2,919,4.368421052631579

6821669,5,B00PTUB45Q,"This anime was awesome. I do have one caveat to that though, this is not an anime for beginners. There are a lot of references and jokes that you would have had to have seen a lot of different kinds and just straight up shows to know what was going on.

6821672,4,B00PTUB45Q,"Take a pinch of preachiness about race and class hierarchies, a dash of outrage about cultural assimilation, a couple of cups (heh, heh) of fan service, and a quart of, let's call it, Otaku Service, mix it together and you have Outbreak Company.

The Japanese government has discovered a portal to another dimension where magic exists and there is a feudalistic society governed by an empress.  A guy named Shinichi who is like the king of Otakus takes an online test and as a result is recruited to go to this other land and spread Otaku culture there.  There are some subplots going on, but the main idea is to throw in as many references to anime, manga, and games as possible.  Explanative text pops up onscreen every few minutes describing what the current scene was referring to.

It's kind of a lightweight breezy show, but it was fun.  Hey, I actually caught a few of the references!",1435881600,2,891,4.6075949367088604

6821680,4,B00PTUB45Q,"Without Giving away any spoilers Outlook Company is a fairly interesting concept of a total fan boy otaku winding up in a magical world with the responsibility of spreading his fandom to this new world. The art is vivid and clean, the English dub sound is clear. I personally enjoyed the series for the most part as it pokes fun and recognizes how much anime and manga can mean to a person and how even if one person believes in you, you can be something much more. Now the negatives I see in the series is much the same as lots of these 11 to 13 episode series I have seen, character development is very limited to the top few characters, there is little time to develop very much back story and even worse there was two episodes I skipped the second time I watched as they did little for the overall story. Maybe some of the left off plot lines would be picked up if a second season is every made. I recommend this series if you want a change of the norm big robot ect. If only interested in the memorable series I would say to rent it",1428192000,5,1037,4.19

6821683,4,B00PTUB45Q,"One of my favorite shows from that season. Full of great in-jokes and obscure references aimed at hardcore anime fans, which makes sense given the plot of the show. The only thing causing the loss of a star is The show is aimed at relatively hardcore anime fans, and those fans are the ones who don't need them. They take up a pretty good chunk of screen real-estate at the top of the screen, and can go by too quickly to even read alongside the subtitles at the bottom. This is the type of thing that should be either it's own subtitle track to be turned on or off, or condense all of them in to a single relatively short supercut as a special feature, another thing Sentai releases tend to lack.

8689165,5,B00PTUB45Q,"Outbreak Company is a wonderful story about love and friendship, differences in cultures, and doing the right thing.

Meet Shinichi, a shut-in otaku who is well-versed in every aspect of otaku culture. While surfing the Internet one day, he applies to join Amu Tech, a company that is looking for someone that fits his description to a ""T"". He lands the job, but wakes up the next day in a different world. He is given the job of General Manager (with a huge salary) and is tasked with introducing and spreading otaku culture to a world with hardly any entertainment and living in a Medieval-like society straight out of fantasy fiction. Shinichi must establish friendly relations with the locals, including the young empress, if he has any hopes of getting the job done. Making friends along the way, Shinichi learns more about cultural differences and the repercussions of his and Japan's actions get him into some the occasionally dangerous situation. Outbreak Company is also filled with references to MANY anime, manga, light novels, and visual novels, which will satisfy any otaku.

If you like ecchi (happens every so often), harem, fantasy stories, taken to another world stories, bits of romance, lots of comedy, the occasional fourth wall break, and otaku culture in general, you'll most likely love this anime. The OP, ED, and OST are all very good and fit the mood well. The voice actors/actresses (Japanese dub) help make the characters enjoyable and match their looks and personalities. The story has a mix of a traditional progressing storyline and slice of life elements that I believe doesn't detract from the enjoyment (some people don't prefer SoL stories, so I feel it's necessary to point this out).

In the end, Outbreak Company is a great anime and I highly recommend it to ecchi and harem lovers, fantasy lovers, and seasoned anime fans who will recognize and love many of the references and general otaku culture theme.",1474416000,,1944,4.957055214723926
