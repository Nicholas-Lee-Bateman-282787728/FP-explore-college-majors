2637012,3,B000HEZ7MK,"I absolutely loved the first series, but was a ""wee"" bit disappointed midway through the second when a key character dies under poorly explained circumstances, it felt melodramatic in an American TV way, and I don't mean that in a good way (saying this as an American, btw), what had compelled you to keep watching prior to this was the relationships, not the contrived drama.  Having said that, there's still plenty of humor and quirkiness to stick with it and I look forward to series three, hope it doesn't lose its way too much!",1199836800,8,532,4.659574468085107
2637013,5,B000HEZ7MK,"I was totally surprised by the quality of the series. Robert Carlyle fits the role of Police Constable Hamish Macbeth. This is one of those series that eclipses its original book series, being M.C. Beatons classic Hamish Macbeth. Though not faithful to the book series, the BBC Scotland production pulls you into the wonderful world of Lochdubh, Scotland. The cast draws from some of the best of British/Scottish actors and actresses. What Doc Martin does for England, Ballykissangel for Ireland, Hamish Macbeth gives you a look Scotland from a Highlander point of view. I highly recommend the series to anyone that loves romantic drama and comedy outside the norm. Cheers",1199664000,11,672,5.118181818181818
2637014,5,B000HEZ7MK,"I am so very very glad that this series was finally released on DVD in North America.  And while I've just ordered the 3-series set, I've seen many of the episodes courtesy of a friend in Canada who sent me VHS tapes recorded off TV.

The Hamish Macbeth series is not about a law enforcement officer in a small Scottish town.  Rather, it's a series about a person who lives in a small Scottish town who ""happens"" to be a law enforcement officer.  In short, the series endeavors to explore Macbeth as a man who lives in a small town and wants to continue living there ... with the ever-present knowledge that his accomplishments as a law enforcement officer, if noticed by ""upper"" authorities, could lead to a transfer elsewhere.

The series, therefore, does not dwell so much on the mysteries he has to solve (though he does solve them) as much as it does on the eccentricities of small town living and the effect of these eccentricities on the man assigned to keep order there (as well as those he calls his friends and neighbors).  It is a rare police-related series that is highly character driven ... with one of the characters being the fictional village, Lochdubh, where the action takes place.

Sadly, it only lasted for 3 seasons ... and even then, encompassed only 20 episodes total.  But they are 20 episodes worth seeing over and over again.",1199404800,11,1352,4.604166666666667
2637015,4,B000HEZ7MK,"A true gem. Robert Carlyle shines as the unassuming constable of Lochdubh village, surrounded by an unknown (at least on this side of the pond) yet very capable cast of richly developed and surprising characters. Quality entertainment with a charming Scottish twist of British humor.

The series is LOOSELY based upon the mystery books by MC Beaton, a few parallels can be drawn but its not a series of sleuthing police mysteries. Quite the opposite: Hamish is well aware of how competent police work brings the wrong sort of attention to his comfortable corner of western Scotland. The sort that would mean notice from the big city departments, promotions, and moving back to the hustle and bustle of urban policing.

And the townsfolk are quite anxious to ensure Hamish gets to stay exactly where he is, they remember too well The Man Before The Man Before MacBeth with the endless nuisances committed upon their fair village, they would much prefer to keep things as they are just now, thank you very much.

From the curious theft of almost a hundred-weight of table salt at the local grocery (and not a drop of whiskey was stolen, how odd) to the football match that empties the entire town (will the last person leaving Lochdubh please switch off the lights) every show is a delightful and  smart spotlight on life in a small isolated community at its best.",1190160000,99,1362,4.782978723404256

2637019,5,B000HEZ7MK,"Hamish MacWho??  Being a fan of Scottish television, I purchased this and find that Robert Carlysle is the star, couldn't remember where I knew the name until I popped into player. It is Mr Gold/Rumplestiltskin from OUAT!  And he is my favorite in that series. Shirley Henderson, who plays the journalist, you'll recognize as Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter as well as Brigit Jones close friend.  She has a very distinctive voice & face.  Also in Hamish, you see Dominic Minghella's name a few times. You'll know him from Doc Martin fame.

Have seasons 1-3 and won't give spoilers, but they are ruthless when pursuing a plot line, insofar as a character's survival. The series was filmed 1995 - 1997 and is as fresh today as I expect it was 20 years ago.",1485216000,4,755,4.646616541353383

2637026,5,B000HEZ7MK,I was introduced to Hamish Macbeth through a friend. The series doesn't match the books but if you only start with the series it is fine. It is a bit hard for me to make out the dialogue but that is because I am not use to listening to the Scottish accent and that is why I purchased the series so I could replay and use closed caption. There are some very funny social satire episodes. Good acting and a group of characters I would like to know in real life,1470787200,,458,4.043956043956044

Sorry but it is not even closely related to her books other than the location and the names of a few of the characters. This is little more than a soap opera with a bit of crime thrown in every now and then.

2637062,1,B000HEZ7MK,"As an admirer of M C Beaton and her series of sleuthing novels featuring Hamish MacBeth set in Lochdubh Scotland, I purchased these videos.  When comparing the videos to the books, I was very disappointed.  The characters VERY vaguely resemble the characters in the books.  We made it through Series ! and Series 2, but disliked the videos enough to not even attempt to put the third Series in our cd player.  These videos do NOT rate the moniker of mystery stories.  They are more in the realm of humorous soap opera stories.  Unfortunately the humor is such that it does not laugh along with the characters portrayed, but pokes fun at the characters portrayed.  Yes, there are humorous characters in the books, but the humor is not directed at the character, but with the character.  Each episode seems to have a different writer, so it appears that this is a series in search of an author.  The episodes do follow somewhat of a timeline, but are quite disjointed.  My initial impression of this series is that they were written by authors who are city folk and that they neither understand nor like country folk.

On the positive side, the setting of these videos is in a drop dead gorgeous location.  Lochdubh is in northern Scotland in the county of Sutherland.  The ocean, lake, and stream views are simply unique considering the population density of Great Britain.",1428969600,2,1372,4.738396624472574

2637080,5,B000HEZ7MK,"Great show! We were introduced to the series last year, right before we went traveling around the UK. We visited quaint Lochdubh (Plockton), walked around town and chatted with friendly locals, then drove down to Kyle of Lochalsh for a nice dinner at the Stag Bar (Balmacara Hotel). The interior looks pretty much the same as it did on the show 20 years ago! After that adventure, we just had to buy our own Hamish MacBeth DVD set. Slightly disappointing that one of the episodes has been omitted, but I suppose it's nothing that upgrading to region-free DVD player and purchasing  DVDs from overseas wouldn't fix. The quality of these DVDs is reasonable, given the pre-HD era this was filmed in.",1421712000,2,696,4.75206611570248

The characters and scenery -- and storylines that are hokey, hilarious, and heartbreaking by turns -- add up to a fabulous series that's worth the purchase. The missing episode aside, you really get the full meal with buying the complete series. (And if you're a hammer-handed clod like be & you crack a dvd, just re-order the series you messed up & *poof*! Replaced!)

We are fans of British mysteries, not hard to understand if you've grown up on the American offerings of mysteries, we feel ties to our Scottish ancestry, and we enjoy the quirky characters to be met on this series.  When in Britain about 4 years ago, we made a point of visiting Plockton and Kyle of Lochalsch (? spelling).  Spent a couple of nights on the Isle of Skye, to get a feel for life in a small town on the shores of Scotland.  My wife and I both wish this series had continued, just to find out what happened to some of the characters.  There were many elements which appealed to us:  Even the tiny bit of romance necessary for some viewers was there, the ""quietly acceptable drug use"" by one of the main characters, the ""equally acceptable larceny"" found in others, the hills and valleys (from a bit farther afield) were lovely to see (and feel when we visited.)  There are, sadly, few series to come close to this one.

2637140,5,B000HEZ7MK,"This is an excellent series set in the Highlands of Scotland in a fictional village called Lochdubh (pronounced loch-du). Don't expect this to be another British detective series a la Frost or Inspector Morse/Lewis genre. Think more the US show Northern Exposure transplanted to the Highlands with eccentric characters centering on the local constable and beautiful scenery. There are a few mysteries, but that's not the point of the show. Just outstanding and highly recommended. We watched a season a night straight through and didn't tire of it.

Now a word about closed captioning. I hesitated on buying this DVD series for over a year under the impression there was no closed captioning or it wasn't possible to get it working. (Subtitles are turned on with the DVD player, but this series does not have subtitles.)

I finally figured out the issue, got the DVDs and the closed captioning works perfectly. But you have to connect your DVD player in a particular way. Let me elaborate:

1. Your DVD player MUST be connected via component video or composite video (including audio) (see for example, component cable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mediabridge-RCA-Component-Video-Cable-with-Audio-6-Feet/dp/B001ID829O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mediabridge RCA Component Video Cable with Audio - (6 Feet)</a>. (At least I know these will work. There may be other possibilities.) You CANNOT use an HDMI connection to view it. (It can have the HDMI connection in place as well as one of the videos, but you must use the video connection to view the closed captioning.) (HDMI works fine with subtitles since they come from the DVD player itself.)

2. You must put your DVD player on normal or interlaced mode if you have a choice. You cannot use progressive mode in any fashion. If you cannot turn off progressive mode, you won't be able to see the captions. Some DVD players have a button, others have to use the setup menus. Read the manual for your player.

3. Turn on closed captioning on your TV (CC1 works fine). It must be on, not just when sound is muted.

This procedure works fine for me, but until I had everything in line, nothing was visible. Turning off progressive mode was the final key to getting captions visible. This will work for any DVDs that have closed captions (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen-Complete-Series-1/dp/B004FUKLL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen: Complete Series 1</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-of-the-Sun-Boxed-Set-Private-Lives-Hide-in-Plain-Sight-The-Sport-of-Kings/dp/B0001WTUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)</a>).",1379980800,6,2826,5.931203931203931

2637142,3,B000HEZ7MK,"As an AVID M.C. Beaton reader, I was really disappointed in this version of Hamish.  I did not read most of the stories in this collection, but Beaton's Hamish was a tall person with really red hair, so as much as I love Robert Carlyle in everything else I've seen him in, he physically was no match for Hamish.  Also, the book Hamish appears somewhat oafish, yet has a strong sense of justice and cares deeply for each of the town's inhabitants (well, most of them anyway).  I did not get any of this from the film Hamish.  The films are interesting and of course, Beaton's storylines are always fun and invite the reader to try to figure out who the villain is, but this collection just simply did not have the warmth, familiarity between characters, or the overall pizzazz I expected after reading so many of the MacBeth books.

My hope is that someone will make a BBC series out of the Agatha Raisin and the newer Hamish books and do a better job.  I would be one of their best audience members.",1373587200,5,999,4.4021739130434785

2637152,4,B000HEZ7MK,"Like many, I became a fan of Robert Carlyle by watching Once Upon A Time. I had seen him years ago in The Full Monty and loved it, but I didn't keep up with his career until more recently. I first saw Hamish Macbeth when I rented it from my local library and it did not disappoint. The story is about a police constable in the small Scottish village of Lochdubh. The town is filled with quirky unusual characters and Hamish is quite laid back in his law enforcement role. There is usually a mystery element to each episode and Hamish finds himself romantically linked to two women during the course of the series. The love triangle eventually resolves itself when he finally makes his choice and that leads to some unexpected consequences. To be perfectly honest, there were a couple of episodes where the plot was a bit slow but overall very enjoyable. I really liked seeing Robert Carlyle in this softer, more laid back role as opposed to the 'crazy' characters he's known for like Begbie in Trainspotting. I would recommend Hamish Macbeth to any Robert Carlyle fan or anyone else who enjoys British television shows like ' Doc Martin'.",1359676800,,1138,4.638613861386139

It was fun to recognize some characters from the books, and of course to feel at home in the cozy village of Lochdubh, but also interesting to try and figure out which plot elements were borrowed from the books and which were newly created.

This is a DVD set that I will watch again and again, I'm sure. Robert Carlyle is one of my favorite actors, so seeing him in anything is a treat. The beautiful scenery and soothing accents are good for escaping reality, one hour at a time.",1357689600,,746,4.20979020979021

2637179,5,B000HEZ7MK,"Robert Carlyle bears no physical resemblance to the Hamish MacBeth characters of the M.C. Beaton books, but is wonderfully suited to the role.  The quirky, lazy character of the books is brought to the screen by Carlyle in his best role.  If you liked ""The Full Monty"", you'll like this uncoplike policeman of the tiny village of Loch Dubh.  MacBeth doesn't like to arrest people (it just causes more work for him), preferring unorthodox solutions to minor infractions of the law.  He loves his dog more than a lot of people, and is always willing to give villagers the benefit of the doubt.  But he will stop at nothing to find perpetrators of violent crime.

The spectacular scenery of the Scottish Highlands is an added bonus to the enjoyment of these totally unpredictable tales.  When MacBeth gets upset, his pronunciations become slurred, making understanding a little difficult for those not used to Scottish idiom.  This doesn't, in any way, detract from the stories.  MacBeth, who is more committed to animals than to personal relationships has girlfriend problems.

It's a shame that Hamish MacBeth was only produced for 3 seasons. That is my only complaint about the series.  If you want more, there are many books, and they are still being written.",1325030400,2,1260,4.924170616113744

2637181,4,B000HEZ7MK,"I can't remember how I stumbled across this series, but am VERY glad that I did.  It is comedy; it is drama.  It is thoroughly enjoyable, having great humor, excellent characters and character development.

A small town policeman Hamish Macbeth (Police Constable, or ""P.C. Macbeth"" in the Scottish vernacular) is set in a small Highland town of fierce loyalties.  As capable of bending a law as he is of enforcing it, Hamish is actually quite a sharp detective, but busily hides it because he ardently desires to avoid ANY notice from the higher ups.  Credit for his crime-solving abilities would mean unwanted attention.  That would eventually mean a transfer out of the BEAUTIFUL Highland community where he has become an essential part of the close-knit fabric of this small town.  The antics with which he manages to solve local crimes and do justice for his community--without garnering any credit--is an integral part of this series' humor, though plenty of comedy is also mined elsewhere throughout.

Hamish is also a flawed character, making him seem much more real, more down to earth.  He is capable of deeply feeling guilt when his actions, though well intentioned, cause harm.  On the whole, his flaws make him much more likeable.  These flaws are not overdone, and certainly make him more realistic than the portrayal of an unflawed palladin would have done.  We get an intimate look at the eccentricities, integrity and honor of the title character throughout the series, and he measures up as a man of character and honor despite his flaws.

I also loved the townsfolk.  This show, like the Canadian series, ""Corner Gas,"" exhibits wonderful local color that is characteristic of ANY small town, regardless of continent and culture.  In both of these series, despite having grown up on another continent or in another country--I KNOW and grew up with these people!

I loved pretty much everything in ""Hamish Macbeth.""  I loved the Scottish accents and customs that come through in the Series.  I loved the humor and the characters.  I loved the strong loyalties of the characters for their town and for each other--especially the steadfast loyalty of Hamish's right-hand man.  Of keen interest through the series is a love triangle with a dramatic resolution and double climax.  I appreciated the character development, which was pretty good for a short-lived series of only 3 seasons.  (Perhaps the best compliment is that I DEARLY wish it could have been longer, but Robert Carlyle, the actor playing the title character, was clearly off to bigger and better things.)

In fact, my ONLY criticisms are for what was left OUT of the DVD set.  There is no way to turn captions on from the DVD.  The Scottish accents are pretty thick to unaccustomed American ears, and those who have trouble hearing accents will miss large amounts of dialogue.  However, if your TV has a Closed Captioning setting, there ARE CC codes within the signal itself, so this defect can be gotten around by turning on Closed Captioning from your TV's settings.  My only MAJOR criticism though, is of the DISC SET and NOT of the series itself.  An episode, ""West Coast Story,"" which should have been Season 1, episode 4, was left out of the first season's discs. (What were they THINKING?!!)  I would normally have wanted to deduct about 1/2 a star for the CC difficulty and TWO stars for the missing episode but I couldn't bear to give it less than 4 stars because I enjoyed the series SO much.  The series itself would get a solid 5 stars from me.

I heartily recommend this series.  As soon as I am able, I plan to dive into M.C. Beaton's books which inspired it.",1315008000,12,3652,4.821543408360129

2637195,4,B000HEZ7MK,"I came across this series by accident, while watching a ""Monarch of the Glen"" DVD. I was intrigued enough not only to invest in the disks, but to read the books as well. I am pleased I did both. Marion Chesney, the Scottish born writer behind the M.C. Beaton pseudonym, has been delighting her readers with the highly addictive Hamish MacBeth mysteries since 1985. Hamish is the likable, but lazy and devoid of ambition bobby in the village of Lochdubh (pron: loch-doo). His keen mind and vast knowledge of local characters make him an effective crime fighter. However, he goes into much trouble hiding the fact from his superiors, in fear he'd be promoted out of the village he loves and considers his home. Whenever I recommend this series to someone, I am often asked these two questions:

-How does the series compare to the books?
Because of time restraints a series puts on a script, it is natural that some adjustments must be made. So, do not expect this to be a faithful adaptation. The huge advantage of the series is the generous inclusion of beautiful Scottish scenery. There is very little prose in the books that refers directly to nature, whereas in the series nature has been elevated almost to a status of a lead character. Smart (and satisfying to the viewer) move! You might find however, that a favourite human character of yours has been eliminated. But, there are a few delightful additions that I think adequately make up for the loss. The treatment of the character of Hamish MacBeth does pain me though. I find him not at all as likable in the series as he is in the books. For that reason alone, I give the series 3.5 stars.

-How does the series compare to ""Midsomer Murders""?
Well, for one, it takes place entirely in Scotland, rather then England. It is much more ""brow"", then ""high""; there are no fiscally wealthy characters here. However, when it comes to the wealth of their feelings for their village, Scotland, and one another, the eccentric Lochdubh bunch can give Midsomer inhabitants a run for their money. ""Hamish MacBeth"" is not only a mytery drama, but a romance as well. There is a lot of attention paid to the love lives of Hamish and the supporting characters. Last, but not least, the body count is decidedly lesser. Sometimes, there are no bodies at all and murders are prevented all together, or are solved before they happen (yep...).

Whether you view the series as a stand alone work, or as a companion to the books, you are bound to appreciate the light entertainment value it provides!

Enjoy!",1256428800,4,2544,4.684563758389261
2637196,5,B000HEZ7MK,"The legendary Stone of Destiny crowns this series, amidst Highlanders running around crags in kilts. This series and cast is so good that even the Westie terrier ""Wee Jock"" can't steal the show. The deft Robert Carlyle is one of the best actors out there, real and subtle, too excellent for Hollywood. Shirley Henderson of Harry Potter's ""Moaning Myrtle"" fame is always great, but so is all the talented cast. Billy Riddoch as Lachlan Sr. ""Daddy"" is a portly treat, and Stuart Davids as Lachie Jr. is superb. Davids would be a fantastic Doctor Who, capable of portraying every nuance of emotion, like David Tennant. Ralph Riach as the psychic T.V. John is pitch-perfect. Season Three features a cameo by the writer Daniel Boyle in his ""Deferred Sentence"" as the Handsome Sailor. This episode was beautifully filmed on the Isle of Skye, where Boyle's delightful Father McPhail says, ""Religion is irrational de facto, thus it should have some magic in it.""

The main character is the northern Scottish landscape itself, spectacular, cloudy, rife with ghosts and legends, fog, bogs, peat, and single-malt whisky. Each story-line evolves, while Hamish MacBeth's personal and professional challenges make for a complex story. The Celtic imagination woven throughout is quite gratifying. You can't miss the last two episodes featuring the Stone of Destiny. We wish the ghosts of Scotland had graced the last scene as well, and that the series had continued for more seasons. Viewers want more long after the last disk is done.

This series is just wonderful, all the ensemble cast characters totally and gloriously support the main character.  Hamish, or Carlyle, is a Scottish constable who is assisted by all the kooky village people even when they themselves are the ""culprits"".  The stories are well written and the Scottish Highlands are beautiful,  The only problem, for me, is the Scottish accent which sometimes gets difficult to understand.  I wish they had included English subtitles!!! Despite the ""language barrier"", Hamish manages to resolve all the mysteries the village has to offer.  This series is not the conventional, dark, ""who dunnit"", type of mystery story.

2637200,5,B000HEZ7MK,"I have read each one of the Hamish Macbeth mysteries by M.C. Beaton, and just finished the last of the television series.  It's true that the books are quite different from the show (to start with, Hamish is tall and red-haired in the books, whereas on television he is played by short and dark-haired Robert Carlyle), but trying to say which is better is like comparing apples and oranges.  You just have to accept that each portrays a somewhat quite different fictional universe with its own cast of characters, and then you should have no trouble enjoying both.  I just LOVED this television series and wish it had lasted longer.  That said, they wrapped it up in a very satisfying way.  The best parts for me involved the ongoing love triangle between the title character and the two rivals for his affection, Alex and Isobel.  Alex is clearly based on Priscilla in the books, and Isobel shares an occupation, at least, with Elspeth Grant the journalist.  They're both played by strikingly lovely actresses, but Shirley Henderson played Isobel Sutherland with such tender vulnerability and depth of feeling that I could not help but root for her throughout.  This series deserves a much wider audience and I hope that one day the BBC will re-release it, this time with subtitles.  The accents aren't as thick as they might have been, but there were key moments when I simply could not understand what the characters were saying, and with dialogue and characterizations this good I did not want to miss a drop!  It is an odd yet thorougly pleasing blend of comedy and drama, with elements of surrealism and most of all, a terrific love story!

2637201,3,B000HEZ7MK,"M.C. Beaton has written a series of books that make Lochbubh, Scotland, look like the murder capital of the world, almost like Cabbot Cove, Maine (another series on TV). However, this video series is a nice replica of the main character, Hamish MacBeth, and that is about all. In the books he has given up smoking, in the video, he smokes. In the books, his superior, Inspector Blair, is a fat, alchoholic. In the video he is a chubby non-drinker. In the books, the dog is a mutt named Lugs, in the video it is a Westy named Jock. You do see some spectacular northern Scotland scenery in the video,  which is only lightly described in the books.
We thought this video series would be a better replica of the books, much like the video series of Hercule Periot, from the Agatha Christie books. If you are looking for the M.C. Beaton type of mystery, these videos are not for you.",1240704000,7,878,4.453416149068323
2637202,4,B000HEZ7MK,"This series is fantastic. Robert Carlyle nails the role of a village constable who knows when to look the other way. And the villagers strictly mind their own business as they gossip constantly about each other.

As the series progresses, some key characters evolve and become more interesting. The romantic arc that spans the three seasons is quite moving, but be warned that along the way there are some tragedies.

I'm not sure how I stumbled upon the series, but once I saw the first episode, I had to see them all. That still wasn't enough, so I picked up Ms. Beaton's DEATH OF A GOSSIP, her first Hamish novel. Yes, Hamish has redder hair and he's taller and lankier in the books, but the series enhanced the delight I'm experiencing as I read the books and find elements in them that were used here and there in the series.

Shakespeare often took written works (fiction and history) and rearranged them to suit dramatized renderings. This series is intensely character driven, and the ""mysteries"" seem to exist merely so we can enjoy Hamish and his beloved townsfolk. It's his Zen-like, easy going way of dealing with life and death and the beauty of nature mixed with a razor sharp sense of humor that make him so magnetic to viewers and readers.

Yes, the TV episodes mix up the novels' supporting characters and plots, but they play out well and are thoroughly enjoyable. Addictive, almost!

I'm on book 5 now. I'll read more, and some day come back to enjoy Robert Carlyle bringing his take on Hamish to life again.

2637203,3,B000HEZ7MK,"Book or drama reviews are always dependent upon the reviewer and his or her world view and expectations.  I purchased this set because among other things I am a fan of British mysteries and in particular of the village-rural genre.  I also own and am reading the Hamish McBeth series and enjoy each book enormously.  As all readers do, I visualize each character, their emotions, the physical setting and place.

The TV series is somewhat of a disappointment to me.  On the positive side, the setting, the acting, the casting, filming, and most technical aspects of the production are well done.  But if your standard is authenticity to the author's written text and to the finer nuances of character motivation, the TV series is not as satisfying. The element of mystery is often missing.  The descriptor ""bad soap opera"" comes to mind in some of the episodes.  The producer and the screen writers often miss the mark.  I almost feel the TV series was written by persons who may be ignorant of and hold an animus to small town or rural life.  The books on the other hand positively portray and celebrate the unique characters that are part of non-urban places.

Beaton's (Chesney's) Hamish is motivated by authentic justice and fairness.  If the ""criminal justice system"" fails,  Hamish often finds a means to ""adjust"" reality. In the Beaton's background, there are always elements of humor and ultimate justice.  The TV series sometimes closes off with a brutish tone leaving me with an underlying unease.

Would I buy the DVDs if I had known of these variances with the literary version?  Probably but you might want to wait for a sale and then buy only one disk.

""Hamish"" is different though. For instance, there's usually a mystery that needs to be solved by the main character, and while often humerous and lighthearted, it takes a few darker turns than the other two series I mentioned.  If you're expecting the main character to be something of a Barney Fife because of the small town setting, you'll be disappointed. He's actually complex and flawed, which for me adds to the interest.  The main characters are very engaging and it's fun watching them evolve.  The scenary is beautiful as you'd imagine, but it's really the characters that sucked us in.  We had a hard time taking breaks between episodes, always finding an excuse to watch just one more.  Even our nine-year old son loves them.  It's a shame the series was relatively short-lived, but they did a nice job with character development over the course of three short seasons.  A word of caution though - keep the remote handy to play scenes back as the dialogue can be difficult to follow at times due to the accents, and the often complex story lines can be tough to follow if you don't understand some key exchanges.  Robert Carlyle fans will enjoy seeing this example of his work prior to his starring roles on the big screen.",1206489600,126,1379,4.7364016736401675
2637211,1,B000HEZ7MK,"Having very much enjoyed reading the ""Death of a ______"" series by M. C. Beaton, and having viewed the Hamish Macbeth BBC TV series, I thought I might venture into the review area and offer my opinions.
 I understand that the BBC series of Hamish Macbeth uses similar person and place names and as the book, but frankly, the similarity ends there.  The TV series characters are so different than those in the book that I didn't really enjoy any of the episodes that I watched, which included all of season one, and some of season 2.  I love the intelligent, sensitive, personable, and caring Hamish represented so well in the books.  Macbeth in the TV series seems more like a petty criminal, who is selfish, unprincipled, bumbling, short tempered, and irresponsible.  I found nothing in him to like, and couldn't bring myself to finish watching the series although the DVDs for all three seasons were available to me.
 I have sometimes wondered whether the 14th book in the series, titled ""Death of a Scriptwriter"" might have been the authors way of expressing her disapproval about the way the TV series [miss-]portrayed her beloved characters.  I will not say much about that book's story line, but the book did discuss the way TV scripts often end up taking literature and turning it into popular tripe.  I can not help but wonder if it is purely coincidence that the series ran from 1995-1997, and this book came out in 1998.
 I have loved the books, and have especially enjoyed listening to the series in audio book format. There have been two primary narrators in the audio series, Davina Porter in earlier books, and Graeme Malcolm in the later set.  Both readers were excellent, bringing strong talent and individual strengths and insights to their narrations.  I have especially enjoyed hearing the feminine and masculine perspectives given by Davina and Graeme respectively as they read the separate books.  Of course the insights were written into the book by the author, Marion Chesney (M. C. Beaton), but I think I can better understand how Priscilla Halliburton Smythe feels about her situation hearing Davina read, and I have likewise always felt that Graeme seems to capture Hamish particularly well, giving life and voice to the lovable Highland Constable.
 I can heartily recommend the series to the reader, or listener, but be forewarned--  You will not be able to enjoy the BBC TV series of the same name after reading the books, because it has none of the charm and wholesome appeal that so much fill the pages of every book.
