I practice with these dvds a little each day, (excellence is a habit right), and thoruoughly enjoy sofranek's no-nonsense approach to self-defense. He won't have you memorizing kata's or contemplating your navel, what he teaches is simple to understand and can be quickly learned. I especially enjoyed his knife-fighting instructional. I normally carry a knife for work and was fascinated to learn his quick and easy techniques in how to actually use the thing for more than cutting open boxes. While I hope that I never have to use the skills I've learned from him, I am all the more confident in my day to day life because of him.",1347840000,,685,4.863247863247863
8046366,5,B00079WKZM,"It appears that in the Martial Arts world, everyone is an expert, and if a particular style isn't a given reviewer's own particular form, it's no good. So, there will be people out there who will adversely criticize this approach as wrong in all sorts of ways because it's not their own system.  Be that as it may, this seems a reasonable, well thought out and carefully taught system proceeding step by step from first principles.  While no system can be learned by just watching tapes, there is enough here for even a beginner who will get out and practice alone and with a partner to learn enough to be useful.",1203897600,5,613,4.513513513513513
