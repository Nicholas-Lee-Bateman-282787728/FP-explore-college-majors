The Batman Beyond series is about when the original Batman,Bruce, is too old to continue and finds a new person to become batman named Terry,a teenage boy. I enjoy watching this series over and over again. Batman Beyond is a new batman for the new age. It's great!!",1072224000,3,367,4.492537313432836
1244596,5,B00000K4ZC,"This is an excellent video.  It relies on realistic (however sometimes ...) depictions of high school life.  It shows the lives of those who were picked on in school, the drug problems with teenagers and the ever-wonderful, tragic love story.",997056000,,242,5.025
1244597,4,B00000K4ZC,"These three episodes of Batman Beyond show how Terry McGuiness handles life as Batman, a life that not only offers opportunity, but also exacts a price in terms of his relationships with others, at school and at  home.
Golem is an episode that illustrates a fantasy most every kid who's  ever been bullied dreams of - acquiring possession of a powerful force (in  this case a construction robot) with which the bullies can be humiliated.  The best part of the episode is in McGuiness' reaction - he battles the  robot, and makes clear he'd like to do the same to the bullies under  attack.  This is best illustrated in his comment to Bruce Wayne about the  bully being targeted - ""Anyone have a grudge against him?""  ""The list starts with me and extends around the block  twice.""
Next up is a drug story in which Terry, upon stumbling  across a cache of dangerous (and thus illegal) steroidal drugs, finds  himself wrongfully accused by his mother and thus grounded.  The episode  features a genuinely horrifying scene when Terry meets up with Bruce's old  enemy Bane - now little more than a corpse kept (barely) alive by vast  machinery.
But my favorite of this set comes at the end, when Terry  crosses swords with The Royal Flush Gang - featuring George Lazenby (James  Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service).  The Gang is a crime family, the  Walkers, that dresses up as playing cards and possesses a strict familial  code of honor - which causes a meltdown when the youngest, Melanie (Olivia  D'Abo) falls in love with Terry.  For his part Terry experiences his own  meltdown; after breaking up with sometime girlfriend Dana Tan - who  throughout the series comes off as rather snooty and not worth concerning  oneself with - he meets Melanie and in the process has a falling out with  Bruce.
The action and animation shine throughout these three episodes.",952128000,14,1864,4.725856697819315
7914425,3,B00000K4ZC,"Batman beyond is possibly my favorite Batman ever. To me it mixes Spiderman personality with Batman's tools and money. This new Batman isn't wealthy, but he is tied to Bruce Wayne who supplies both resources and intelligence.

I won't spend too much time here, because you're better off just buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-one/dp/B000CSTK42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season one</a>. This was one of a set of two DVDs which was released by Warner Bros. prior to releasing the whole first season. In my opinion, it was a cash grab. I ended up with two of these as a gift because I didn't know they'd ever put the whole season out and I'd rather have the whole season.

If you get this DVD and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tech-Wars/dp/B00016XOBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tech Wars</a>, then you have almost every first season episode, except the pilot, Mr. freeze, and the one where Blight ends up bottom of the ocean. You also end up with a couple episodes of season two. I give this a decent score because the episodes are still great, but in just about every way, you're better off buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-one/dp/B000CSTK42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season one</a>&nbsp;instead.",1329177600,,1352,6.382513661202186
7914426,4,B00000K4ZC,It contains great episodes of the newest Batman and love the characters and am glad I got it.,1246233600,,93,4.222222222222222
7914427,1,B00000K4ZC,Let me start out by saying I love the series Batman Beyond. This DVD is crap six random episodes are on this thing churned out by Warner Bros to make a quick buck. For less than twice the price of this DVD you can buy the whole 1st season of Batman Beyond. Save your money and boycott these quick cash garbage DVDs.,1237334400,,315,4.096774193548387
7914428,1,B00000K4ZC,It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available.,1110412800,4,568,4.69
7914429,2,B00000K4ZC,"I think its wonderful that Warner Bros has decided to release on DVD School Dayz/Spellbound and Tech Wars/Disappearing Inque to each contain 6 episodes and priced with a reasonable price. However, I am extremely disapointed at the fact that the first 3 episodes of School Dayz/Spellbound HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED as the ""bonus episodes"" in the Batman Beyond Movie DVD. This is irritating the heck out of me. I was so looking forward to 6 wonderful episodes I do not yet own, only to get 3 new episodes.",1080345600,5,504,4.738636363636363
7914430,5,B00000K4ZC,"I loved this series, and was always disappointed when they were pre-empted by ""Pokemon"". ""Batman Beyond"" is for adults, and perhaps that is why the WB is marketing ""Justice League"" differently.
For some reason, the geniuses in the WB marketing department think that consumers will be more inclined to buy ""features"" instead of episodic cartoons. PLEASE NOTE that there are 6 episodes of the cartoon on this dvd, not two features, and that several of these episodes were previously released on the ""Batman Beyond: The Movie"" dvd..
Darwyn Cooke is GAWD. Check out ""dc: the new frontier"".",1078531200,6,585,5.041237113402062
7914431,4,B00000K4ZC,"For the sake of clarification, the two ""titles"" on this DVD (School Daze and Spellbound) were previously released separately on video, and are combined together on one DVD.  Each video contained 3 episodes of the original Batman Beyond show.  As such, this DVD contains 6 episodes :  SPELLBOUND / HOOKED UP / A TOUCH OF CURARE / GOLEM / THE WINNING EDGE / DEAD MAN'S HAND.
I think this DVD is aimed at two audiences - as a low priced DVD for the kids, as well as for adults who enjoyed the show.  I personally would prefer a box set containing every episode, but how many parents would buy that for their kids?  Putting the episodes out this way gets both audiences to buy the DVD.
This disc contains no extras, but there is a ""play all"" feature.
Picture looks great, but no subtitles, and only one audio choice.  Still, I give it 4 stars as I feel 6 episodes for the low price is fair.",1078358400,4,886,4.307228915662651
7914432,3,B00000K4ZC,"I was excited when I saw that this DVD was going to be released. Just got my copy.
I thought that all should know that there are 6 episodes on
the disc. Great! Here is the reason for the three stars.
3 of the episodes were previously released on the Batman Beyond the Movie DVD as follows:
Golem
Deadmans Hand
The Winning Edge.
I do recommend the disc to anyone, but wanted to forwarn all
consumers that if they already have the movie, you are really
only getting 3 more episodes.",1078272000,,480,4.285714285714286
7914433,4,B00000K4ZC,A friend works at WB and gave me an early copy. It was OK but it had horible extras.,1077062400,,84,3.473684210526316
