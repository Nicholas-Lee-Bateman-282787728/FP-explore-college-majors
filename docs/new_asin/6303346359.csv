630311,4,6303346359,"SECRET AGENT was Hitchcock's follow-up to the hugely successful THE 39 STEPS, and continues that film's explorations of moral ambiguity and instability of identity.  A very young John Gielgud portrays Edgar Brodie, an English soldier whose identity is deliberately eliminated by the government so his talents may be put to use as a professional spy under the name of Richard Ashenden.  His mission: travel to Switzerland and execute a German spy before he crosses the Swiss border.  Ashenden's accomplices in this state-sanctioned murder are the bizarre and campy bisexual ""General"" (Peter Lorre), who claims to be Spanish but is obviously nothing of the sort, and Elsa (Madeleine Carroll) a rather bloodthirsty woman assigned to play Mrs. Ashenden, who seems to have become an agent just to get a few thrills.  Elsa's gung-ho mindset changes rapidly when the little group deceives and assassinates the wrong man.  Elsa distracts the man's wife by asking for German lessons while Ashenden and the General take him on a mountain trek from which he will not return.  Although the General actually does the killing, Ashenden is complicit in the unwitting crime, and seems to accept it as a matter of course.  This murder sequence is extremely suspenseful, cross-cutting the male plot with the gradual realization of the doomed man's wife that something has happened to her husband because of the increasing agitation of the man's faithful dog.  At the moment of the killing, the dog breaks out into eerie, unforgettable howls.  After this event, Elsa realizes that what she thought was a game was actually in deadly earnest, and she tries to stop Ashenden from going through with the actual muder of the real agent, whose identity is uncovered almost by accident.  The final sequences, including a fire alarm in a chocolate factory and a stunning train wreck, result in the deaths of the German agent and the General, leaving Elsa and Ashenden free to marry and quit the spy business.  As another reviewer has noted, there is a strange and disquieting undercurrent of homosexuality among all the major male characters, who seem to be more interested in each other than any of them is in Elsa.  Indeed, Madeleine Carroll has almost nothing to do in the last half of the film, and the usual sexualized banter between Hollywood lovers is actually given to Ashenden and the General!  Indeed, Ashenden seems oddly reluctant to touch Elsa throughout the film and their love scenes are awkward at best.  I can't say whether any of this was deliberate on Hitchcock's part, or whether was simply the result of casting a trio of homosexual or bisexual actors as the male leads, but the function of this choice undercuts the usual romance angle that we find in this type of story and renders the conclusion quite unbelievable, which perhaps makese sense, considering that no one in the world of this film is what he or she seems to be on the surface.  Still, this is a surprisingly accomplished film which, despite some jarring shifts in tone, is watchable throughout.  By the way, the film is supposedly set in 1916 and the events it chronicles deal with WW I, but don't you believe it for a second!  The costumes and decors are strictly mid-30's, as is the language!  Hitchcock obviously wished to comment on the moral choices forced on people by the deteriorating international situation of the times, and it isn't much of a stretch to relate these people to choices present only in the 1930's!",985910400,8,3483,4.914675767918089
630312,3,6303346359,"Another one of Hitchcock's early British films. Made just one year after Hitchcock's classic 'The 39 Steps'. Hitchcock's trademarks and usual  suspense are greatly tampered making a more comic (?) film with some tense  sexual undercurrents. John Gielgud, who is a master in stage acting and one  of the most respected performers since Olivier stars as the secret agent  who is sent to knock off an assassin. There are some surprising homosexual  undercurrents to his character, he has the opportunity with Madeline  Carroll but never does anything about it. Peter Lorre is also memorable as  the Spanish (?) assassin, a bit too over the top at times but still  delivers. The accents are extremely thick and lots of close-ups of letters  and messages make the plot hard to follow at times. Madeleine Carroll also  stars, Hitchcock had used her as the icy blonde who charms Robert Donat in  'The 39 Steps' just one year earlier. Less suspenseful than most of  Hitchcock's other films and has a lot less to offer. One of the master of  suspense's lesser efforts.

I liked the film because of the way Hitchcock builds the suspense in a viewer up to the climax of the incident  at the Langen Alp. The carachter of Brodie, who has to go on a misson  although he doesn't care much for espionage, and is really cold in some  situations, is very interesting, along with the General and Elsa. Although  his later work is much better in the ways of charachters and effects this  is a good film, and I would recomend it not just to Hitchcock fans, but  anyone who enjoys a good film.",960595200,2,610,4.307017543859649

John Gielgud, from the Shakespearean stage, makes a worthy effort as does  Madelline Carrol, who was in The 39 Steps as well.  Peter Lorre, while a  tad over-the-top and at some times irritating, is a joy to watch.  The main  villain is very smooth and a treat to watch as well.

He travels to Switzerland to discover a German spy and to ensure he is killed by another British agent.  He meets a third British agent who plays his wife in the game.  Today the movie looks dated technologically and plot wise because of all that has happened.  The scenery is painted.
  The tropes are familiar from countless spy movies thereafter.  Some don't find it suspenseful, but I found the train scene suspenseful despite this.
  But this is very much a send-up of the secret agent genre and secret agents with only a necessary fan dance at the end to pass the censors or to appeal to the patriotism of the British audiences, or so I interpret it.  It is very funny in disingenuous and satiric ways.

630551,4,6303346359,"Gracious these reviews! Clearly a lot of people are reviewing this expecting it to be another Birds or Psycho. If that's what you're looking for, then keep looking for another movie and don't bother, because you won't find any more of those. The quintessential Hitchcock is not about one subject alone. In fact, many of his early films were spy related. Did you know that he was asked to direct Ian Fleming books being made into films? When you watch Sean Connery in his Bond films, do you talk about how inaccurate it is?

Circling back around to the subject. This isn't one of his best, but it's still good. If you're a serious Hitchcock fan, then you'll watch it and see the genius in it. If you're not a serious Hitchcock fan, then I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabotage/dp/B002SJ7VS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabotage</a>&nbsp;instead.

There are a few problems with this one and the video quality is only so-so. Still, it's your typical Hitchcock fan. I read where someone said they were surprised by the humor. All of Hitchcock's films have humor in them. He had an incredible sense of it. Sometimes it's either more dry or subtle than others, but it's always there. Always.

John Gielgud was miserable on set and it shows in his performance. He was an elite stage actor and this was his first film. He hated it so much that he went back to stage and didn't make another movie for 20 years. It wasn't Hitchcock necessarily that bothered him. It was the whole filming set up. He liked the preciseness and timing of stage work, which he would never get in film.

This was one of Lorre's earliest Western films. This and his other Hitchcock film, the first version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/dp/B00C9V21C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>. Lorre is, as always, brilliant. One of the funniest lines in the film comes from him and I quote it all the time.

Remember that Hitchcock's worst film was a 'deviational experiment,' so to speak.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamaica-Inn/dp/B00BZB461W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamaica Inn</a>&nbsp;starring Maureen O'Hara is simply terrible. Before you call this the worst, be sure to watch that one. You'll see what I mean.

If you do watch this one, keep these things in mind.

* Hitchcock was very patriotic and liked spy plots. They were his early suspense and I think he came to realize that suspense was what he liked about them, so he later explored other avenues in suspense with mostly murder films.
* He liked adding humor to what was a dark theme. In a sense, you can say he is the progenitor of 'black comedy.'
* His early films were not American and as such had very low budgets. If you're expecting a budget like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/San-Francisco/dp/B004KB8P1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">San Francisco</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Man-Godfrey/dp/B007HJ8G58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Man Godfrey</a>&nbsp;then you'll be disappointed. So what if it's a low-budget-and-you-can-tell movie?

All in all, I still give it 4-stars because you can see Hitchcock's genius rising. It's still funny and for a true Hitchcock fan, essential as are all his movies, except the horrible one I mentioned above.",1431993600,,3484,5.777777777777778

630556,2,6303346359,"This dvd contains two movies from the period before Hitchcock came to work in America. Many of the films from this period are in the public domain, and as a result they're available on many different dvd's from many different companies, usually in pretty poor quality. This dvd is no exception when it comes to that last point. While the version of Sabotage presented here is halfway decent, Secret Agent looks and sounds absolutely HORRIBLE. There are constant loud pops and clicks on the soundtrack and the image is positively ghastly: faded, almost completely black during any scenes that take place in low lighting.

I guess only a genius can ruin a Somerset Maugham plot, and Hitchcock manages to do it.  For starters, everyone except Madeleine Carroll is miscast.  I'm sorry, but there's no way Peter Lorre can convince me he's a homicidal Latin.  And brilliant character actor John Gielgud really has no flare for the role of leading man.  Even Robert Young's gifted artlessness is squandered on a part that makes him seem merely petty.  But more crucial than casting mistakes is a script that  amounts to loose confetti:  it shifts tone unpredictably and fails to maintain narrative continuity.  By the end of the film, it is impossible to determine why anything in the story is occurring.  All that saves SECRET AGENT from complete nullity is the action's rapid pace, Madeleine Carroll's ravishing beauty, and her riveting performance as a reckless adventuress who learns that some invitations are best declined.",1422403200,,1004,5.048780487804878
630559,3,6303346359,"This film is a combination romantic comedy and spy thriller.  Unfortunately it is not a good romantic comedy and is not a good spy thriller. It is not one of Alfred Hitchcocks best films, despite the fact that it was based on a novel by W Somerset Maugham. The film is set during World War I and thus Turkey is enemy territory.  This 1936 film is flawed yet there are specific characteristics that reveal Hitchcocks talents which I will mention below. John Gielgud pays the role of a man returning from the war who is declared dead by the British secret service so that he can take on a new identity, with fake British and American passports. He is sent to Switzerland to locate and eliminate a German spy. He is given this assignment with virtually no training but he is given the assistance of an odd character, The General, played by Peter Lorre. The General is a Mexican assassin working with the British secret service. His behavior is so outlandish that the viewer realizes this is supposed to be a comic character yet he is given deadly assignments and he is actually more astute than Gielguds character at recognizing the underhanded activities that surround them in Switzerland. Gielgud is also provided with another British spy who is supposed to play his wife. She is played by the beautiful Madeleine Carroll. Unfortunately she is totally unprepared to be a spy. She falls in love with Gielgud from the first scene and she is highly disturbed by violence and seems at odds with their mission to kill the German spy once they locate him. She is never convincing as a spy but she is stunning in her beautiful white gown in a Swiss casino. Robert Young plays the American rich boy running around Switzerland during wartime trying to seduce Elsa, the spy-wife.

There is considerable dissonance for the viewer with this cast. The female spy is absolutely unprepared and emotionally inappropriate to be a spy. Gielgud plays a rather cool man and it seems impossible that Elsa would fall in love with him, especially upon first meeting him. Lorre plays a deadly clown role, which is interesting. However when he clowns around, he overacts to the extreme. Robert Young, as the handsome young American playboy would have made a better lead man than the stiff and cool Gielgud.

There were interesting scenes of contrast which shows Hitchcocks art.  Gielgud and Lorre go to a Swiss church to find the organist who is a double agent willing to give the British information. However upon entering the church there is the background sound of one organ note. This had a eerie sensation since it hints at some diabolical discovery to be made, yet this murder scene if followed by a scene where Gielgud and Lorre are hiding in the Church tower while the bells ring and deafen them.  The scenes on the train from Switzerland to Constantinople increase the tensions and are some of best photographed in the film. There is a nice surprise ending with a twist that even takes a contemporary viewer by surprise. The film is not terrible, it just has major flaws.",1420934400,,3054,4.720450281425891

It isn't the Statue of Liberty, a bank of apartments or windmills in Holland but, it does the trick nicely. Like American films that I have seen from this time that take place in the early part of the 20th century, this one has costumes and hairstyles, etc., from the 1930's. Perhaps because of budgets or something, the players do not resemble anything from the WW1 era or seem to be even trying to in the slightest way. Women hardly wore slinky gowns or had short haircuts. Men certainly didn't wear wrist watches or have suits with such a modern cut in those times. This is  disconcerting and distracting. Almost as much as Peter Lorre playing a Spaniard. He is, however, entertaining. He always was, whether funny or creepy. In this movie, he is the former. I have seen every Hitchcock film and this one was a new surprise. Solid, but hardly his best. It looks like his wife Alma also edited this movie early in her career.

Our war spies end up getting credit for a job they couldn't/didn't even do - they were pathetic and so was the whole setup which makes the USA look foolish and incompetent.

630710,3,6303346359,"Made in 1936 as the Nazi's were gearing up, it is about 1916. That allowed director Alfred Hitchcock to depict Germans as enemies without trying to tell the current story. You know, ""Don't worry; it's only fiction.""

A British author's funeral is held, so that he can resurface under another name, Ashendon. He's now a secret agent sent to the Swiss Alps to assassinate a double agent. His assistant is a crazy man known mostly as The General (Peter Lorre), the actual assassin. When he checks into his hotel, Ashendon discovers he is a married man, and that his wife Elsa (Madeleine Carroll) has gotten there before him. She's a spy, too, that has been sent to make him look harmless: a married man with a different name instead of the well-known bachelor that had been his previous identity.

Robert Young plays a dashing young man named Marvin who flirts outrageously with Mrs. Ashendon.

The details are sufficiently complex that I don't want to spoil it. There's a wire-haired dachshund that figures in the story. And all the girls the General is forever chasing. And an expert mountain-climber, a chocolate factory, and trains. Several trains.

My only real complaint with the film is that it's in black and white and fairly dark, so that much of the time I could not really tell what was happening. My impression is this was partly the way Alfred Hitchcock made it, and partly the way time made it. It has been a long, long time, after all, and the original film is probably long since gone. This is probably a copy of a copy of who knows how many generations.

Good story, on the whole, but not so easy to follow. As in proper mysteries, I didn't guess the end until it was nearly there",1336780800,2,1694,4.596026490066225
630711,4,6303346359,"An early Hitchcock yarn where people pretend in what's labeled as a spy thriller, during or soon before World War I.  The film is confusing at times, and I think that's mainly due to the poor quality of the DVD.  Even though the case proclaims clean master and special features, my DVD contained only the film, no special features and the black & white was full of specks and dark patches.  The audio was quite poor and the British accents made it hard to hear.

Despite these difficulties, Hitchcock's early films reflect what he would later incorporate into his successful American films for Hollywood.  A man is made to appear to have  been killed when he in fact goes undercover.  He meets a woman who is to be his ""wife"", a philanderer (Peter Lorre) who pretends to be Mexican but is in fact a ruthless killer (he cackles when he kills, even if it is the wrong man), and tends to overact the part.  This is supposed to be for humorous effect but came across forced and silly.

There is a love affair of sorts where the woman spy who is pretending to be a wife actually falls for the guy.  Meantime the guy wants out of the spy business but decides to go at it one more time with deadly results.  John Gielgud pulls off an understated performance that is charming as well as sincere.

The American actor Robert Young (way too much eye make-up there, Bob!) makes an early appearance as the flirtatious ""ugly American"" who vies for the woman spy's affections (to little effect).  But there is much more to Robert's character than it appears.  Hitchcock brings off the big reveal in the last 20 minutes of the film in some pretty horrific train crash scenes.

The film's production values are top-notch - use of crowds in moving the story along, the unusual camera angles and close-ups keep the viewer interested, and the excellent tool of light and shadow Hitch learned from his silent movie-making days makes for a technically excellent film, if a somewhat fair story.

There are a few plot holes in the story too, though I may have missed the tie-up due to poor quality - the beginning of the film has a one-armed man who fakes the spy's death (novelist Nolan) but it's hard to figure out how he fits into the story.  We never see him again!

Bottom Line:  Would have liked to have gotten a better quality copy.  Even so, the film is not hard to follow if you can put up with Lorre's silliness!  Recommended for Hitch fans only.",1332633600,3,2432,4.494305239179955

To begin with, what was the point of faking Edgar Brodie's (John Gielgud) death so he could be sent out as a spy for England? Supposedly his death was faked because he was well known. After his funeral, he was given a fake name and passport and sent off on his mission. Why not just simply give him the fake name and passport without the fake death? There was no point to it. Furthermore, would British intelligence really send out someone like the character Madeleine Carroll played (Else) to do a dangerous spy mission? (She had no stomach for the dark arts of espionage, and even questioned that the German spy was a spy because he was so ""nice."") Would British Intelligence really send out the fake couple Mr. and Mrs. Ashenden (Gielgud and Carroll) without any training?

What I saw was excellent The best advice I can give a viewer is to ignore any of we reviewers and see the film regardless of what any of us may say. It is a manual of screen style, a fascinating look at common attitudes toward war, in the period between WW1 and WW2, and a chance to see a great stage actor, one of the top names in character acting of his day, and one of the most glamorous blondes of the period. There is nothing high-tech about it, but Hitchcock displays his maturing skills with his evocation of The Railroad and many of the scenic encounters developed in the silent era, but now accompanied by a complementary sound track. Lilli Palmer, one of the truly beautiful actresses of her day, shows no sign of it in her billed, but easily overlooked, bit role. Robert Young does a good job in one of his earliest roles, one of the rare ones that allowed him a few minutes of serious acting
The story, based on a very popular novel by Somerset Maugham, is trimmed to a neat central plot: a German agent is on his way to the Middle East to make a deal with the Arabs without whose help, the Allies could not effectively combat Germany's ally, Turkey, which controlled the area. The British have sent two agents and a professional killer to stop him.

John Gielgud is excellent in this role, and is complimented by the lovely Madeleine Carroll, a thrill seeking agent who stars as his ""wife"". Robert Young, more known for his roles in musicals and a few crime dramas, plays the part of an American, and the ""third man"" in this movie, invoking more than a passing interest in Carroll.

Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer.  All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young.  Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film.  He makes the film his own!

630798,3,6303346359,"Literary 'Types' can make for long-lived cinenma characters, which make for what are called nowadays, Franchises, like the James Bond series.  Just yesterday I was lookiing over the first filmed CASINO ROYALE -- that black/white demi-feature/part movie production for TV -- and was reminded yet again of something I'd seen in an old Hitchcck movie, this one called SECRET AGENT.  It was mostly the black and whie character of the picture that caught me; it seemed to exagerate certain macabre qualities in the background players.  The had the look of marionnettes.  This New Look post-war drama was supposed to take place in a gambling casino on the French Riviera.  The costumes the actors wore were from a time half a century past, and there, in the center of the assembly, was a face I couldn't forget, Peter Lorre, the Vienese actor, playing the part of a Russian villain, LeChiffre, as he'd played countless villains in dozens of films, from his celebrated debut in 'M' down to any pot-boiler you care to name.  And then it hit me:  He's playing or almost camping, his role as the General from SECRET AGENBT.

I don't believe I ever saw the original broadcast of the Fleming story; if I had I'd almost certainly have remembered it.  Live Television broadcasts of dramatizations were sensational and absolutely thrilling to a degree difficult to imagine nowadays.

What's particularly interesting about that is that the role of the General was adapted from one of W. Somorset Maugham's stories, THE MEXICAN ASSASSIN from his unusual novel THE ASHENDEN STORIES; a novel in the form of several interrelated but independent stories.  Hitchcock chose two of those stories, THE MEXICAN ASSASSIN and another one the title of which I can't remember, to make THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.

Now, Lorre made 'M' when he was very young and plump.  That added to the excitement of the story of a psychoathic pedophile murderer.  For decades Lorre remained caught in what would have been a deadly, limiting Monster career rut, pedophile as swish homo.  That he's seen here in earrings with curled hair and mouthing a camp Spanish is part of the same pseudo-sexual angle he used to play Joel Cairo in THE MALTESE FALCON.  Type.  It was all type, then.  And that hack work fed him and his happy Hollywood family well for years, through his MISTER MOTO (Japanese) period, and virtually until the day he died.  Echoes of all that false sexual persona rang out in CASINO ROYALE, in the un-manly slights and slurs this (blonde, Nordic) American James Bond of the 50s hurled at him.

Be all that as it may have been, what interests me, here -- and what I hope may interest you -- is the role young John Gielgud plays; Ashenden, the British Agent.  Now, there had been English detectives before, in silents, and in talkies -- there was always Conan doyle, after all, as well as many others -- but this was the first time a certain, new kind of detective stuck in the public's sub-conscious.  Imagine:  A reluctant detective and agent moving seamlessly through the ranks of international society folks?  The rich and idle at play?  We know if we examine the fiction and film (THE RICH ARE ALWAYS WITH US) and (DODSWORTH) of the thirties, that after the Financial Crash the rich left their countries -- to avoid the possibility of public unpleasantnesses and/or revolutions -- and travelled the globe on ships, trains and planes, going from one remote watering place to another remote watering place and spa, often ingognito and biding their time.  Maugham will be seen travelling with them in fact, and through art will  become the fictional James Bond.

And now, this Ashenden.  Who is he?  He was, a real man, and his name was William Somorset Maugham.  Maugham wrote about himself at a remove.  This movie which was released in 1936, was a transmutation of various incidents in his career nearly twenty years before; things that happened to him during WW I.  You see, Maugham had been inducted into the English Secret Service and actually was in fact, a working spy.  He describes the incident in one of the ASHENDEN stories, and gives the name of the head of the Service as 'C.'  It's 'M' in the Bond stories, but to check Maugham, you might want to read 'THE LIFE OF SIR STEWART MENZIES, SPYMASTER TO CHURCHILL, by Anthony Cane Brown.'  'C' was real.  Maugham was real too.

But, why Maugham?  Maugham's first language was French.  He was born in Paris where his diplomat father was stationed.  He spoke English with an impediment all his life, though he spoke both French and German without any impediment of any kind.  He had been trained as a doctor, but never practiced, and had steady nerves, no fear of blood, and was not squeamish.  As a young man he made his debut as a novelist and had some success, but he changed and became a playwright and enjoyed enormous popular success.  He became the toast of London and New York, knew everybody and socialized widely and at the highest levels.  'C' therefore, thought he would not be out of place in high society, everywhere.  Maugham married an attractive,  stylish woman he did not love -- a society interior decorator with connections in aristocratic circles -- and they were seen everywhere together.  She presented him with a daughter he did not recognizr for more than two decades, and they maintained the appearance of a socially acceptable domesticity, with little or no intimacy.  'C' thought that because he was an artist and possibly an homosexual, he would be accustomed to dealing with criminals as well as other low types.

Maugham proved to be dependable and brave.  He was one of the last people to live British Headquarters, Moscow, after the Bolsheviks began taking over the city and it became apparent that the English incursion (or invasoin) into Russia would come to nothing.

THE MEXICAN ASSASSIN tells the story of an assignment he was given by 'C', in which he was to hire and then to direct a professional killer from another country -- who it turns out, does not perfectly understand English or reconize Agency protocol -- to do a job in yet a third country.  The man does his murder, and is paid off.  Then, Ashenden finds the wrong man has been murdered.  Well, two or possibly three of these ASHENDEN stories were turned into Hitchcock movies.

I have seen all the Fleming-BOND derived movies over and over, and pre-BOND templates as well.  Except for the gadgets, none of them have any surprises for me.  The best of the BOND stories are pale indeed, beside the ASHANDEN ones.  However, I love them all because I love Maugham's original conception; his style.  I think we all do, though we may not understand it.

Anyway, to me the real interest in the old movie here, SECRET AGENT, is knowing its origin and watching actors play out their parts in what became, over time, internationally recognizable faux-lovers and Types in Cinema; the smartly dressed, dangerous yet diffident man, and the clinging, neurotic and perhaps fatally compromised woman.  They appear in all the BOND movies in various forms and permutations, but here they have a particular appeal when one contrasts the chaming and outgoing Madelaine Caroll with the cold, diffident John Gielgud.  In a true marriage of convenience, they are friendly, but flawed.  Like the lovers in some E.T.A. Hoffmann ballet, they are held in a glittering web of evil -- able to gesture, but not to connect.  And we, because we are in the dark and pity thier beautiful unhapppiness, we love them because they cannot love themselves.

Turn off the sound and watch them move across those strange, beautiful rooms, filled with those over-dressed people.  Danger!  Cold, pale, restless, they don't know who they are.",1254355200,3,7728,4.803787878787879

630800,5,6303346359,"""But your wife, she'll wonder what happened to her poor little General."" -- Peter Lorre to John Gielgud

This most enjoyable film made in Britain before Hitchcock came to Hollywood certainly deserves more accolades than it has gotten over the years. It really isn't that far behind 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, and Young and Innocent in either quality or entertainment. Set during the first world war, Somerset Maugham's novel of spies sent to ferret out and eliminate another spy has romance and humor and some real excitement in Hitchcock's hands.

John Gielgud comes home from the war and discovers he's been reported dead. He discovers it was intentional, his cover so he can become Ashenden, and eliminate a very dangerous German spy causing the good guys a lot of trouble. While it's deadly serious business, it gets a bit more pleasant when he discovers in Switzerland that the beautiful and elegant Elsa Carrington (Madeleine Carroll) is to pose as his wife and help him in his mission.

Hitchcock counters the more serious business with a likable Robert Young as Marvin, pursuing romance with Elsa despite her marital status. It is handled with great charm and a sense of fun. Ashenden's other partner is General, played in an over-the-top manner by Peter Lorre. He is more comical than sinister, spending most of his time trying to romance anything in a dress, and quite upset that Ashenden has the fake wife while he has nada.

Elsa falls for her pretend husband, of course, and when the amoral General mistakingly kills the wrong man, a crisis of conscience occurs for both she and Ashenden, who decide to break off this ugly business and go back. But when he and General discover who the real spy is, they must pursue him because Elsa is in danger. The train station scene and everything that follows is classic Hitchcock. While it doesn't have quite the tension of 39 Steps, or the charm of Young and Innocent, it has a blend between the two which is very enjoyable.

Perhaps because it is set during WW I it doesn't connect as much as it should for some viewers. It is quite fabulous in its own way, however, and fans of Hitchcock's early British films will certainly find it appealing. Fans of the lovely Madeleine Carroll will be pleased to discover she is much more in the center of things from the very beginning than in 39 Steps, in which she is also marvelous. The Westlake print is both decent and watchable if unspectacular. A real winner.",1225584000,4,2462,4.729603729603729

Still..one night scene on a lake briefly becomes hard to watch.
However, the copy is still acceptable in quality until a restored release, if it ever happens, is released.
The DVD appears full in length.
The movie has all the early Hitchcock touches:
the crafted use of sound in pivotal scenes, (as his teacher, Lang, did, most notably in his Testament of Dr. Mabuse),
the use of minature models, (which I enjoy, especially when obvious but still well done. It is sooo much better then mismatched stock footage insertions),
and the use of excellent and interesting actors. Here we have a young pre-Sir John Guilguld, as well as a young Peter Lorre in his second role for Hitchcock (having just flown in from America after doing the remake of the Hands of Dr. Orlac in Hollywood), to play a cartoon skirt chasing mustachioed Mexican contract killer working for the government character...really. Presumably, this time Lorre understood the actual meaning of his script, (unlike two years earlier in The Man Who Knew Too Much). Dialogue is weak and a major flaw of the movie.  A must for both Lorre fans, and Hitchcock fans.
  I remain, frustrated from waiting for an American DVD copy of Young and Innocent with the full 90 minutes.

Elsa is patriotic & the carnage going on at the front does not bother her. But she has a problem with killing one person face to face as they must do.

The tried-and-true Hitchcock touches are here: the man-woman antagonism in the main characters, the staged bigger-than-life settings (a huge chocolate factory), and the audience knowing the facts about the killer and chase before the actors do.

630838,3,6303346359,"For some reason I just don't enjoy the British Hitchcock films as much as I enjoy the American ones. I find the British films a bit smug, I don't think the humor and suspense jells correctly. It wasn't until his American films that he started to get it right. Movies such as ""The Lady Vanishes"", ""The 39 Steps"" and this one are entertaining but lack something that Hitchcock's later films would offer.

 John Gielgud plays Edgar Brodie a novelist who has been reported dead by the government so he can go undercover to track down a German spy during WW1 in Switzerland. He he arrives there he finds out that a partner has been sent to help him; a woman (Madeleine Carroll) who is posing as his wife.

 All of this sounds quite good. There is a lot of promise in the plot. But I felt the movie never really knows what to do with it. The tone of the movie is at time boring. There is no real suspense.

 While at the hotel Elsa Carrington (Carroll) meets a man, Robert Marvin (Robert Young, of TV's ""Father Knows Best""). Marvin is attracted to Elsa even after he finds out that she is married.

 As the two try to find the unknown spy they are lead on the wrong trail and kill an innocent man. After this Elsa doesn't want to continue their work and demand to go back home. She can not live with these actions on her conscious. At this point in the movie one wonders what is Hitchcock trying to tell us? Is he making a passivist war movie? Is he trying to say that even if you kill a person in a time of war, murder is still murder?

 Some could argue this is the movie the recent ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" should have been. Both movies deal with a phony marriage, murder, and spies. But the different with this movie is these characters are smart.

 Peter Lorre co-stars, in believe it or not, a comic relief role. He brought the movie down in my opinion. First of all I've never thought of Lorre as a great actor, secondly I never thought of him as a comic actor. When Lorre is on screen the movie struggles with the correct tone. When we see him we are getting comedy, but the movie seems too serious for that so it balances both. This hurts the movie. And what about that accent Lorre uses? It sounds awful.

 Also the Robert Young character gives the movie a screwball comedy appeal along the lines of ""The Awful Truth"" or ""My Favorite Wife"". With Young we are getting a love triangle that is played for comedy.

 ""Secret Agent"" is quite predictable but I suppose it doesn't matter, Hitchcock fans are going to watch this movie anyway. It is a harmless movie that shows how much he imroved when he came to America. Some of the performances are good, especially Gielgud, who always has a straight face on. Many may remember him in his Oscar winning role as the butler in ""Arthur"". And Madeleine Carroll appeared in Hitchcock's better film ""The 39 Steps"" and co-starred with Bob Hope (is there any woman he didn't act with?) in ""My Favorite Blonde"".

 Bottom-line: Enjoyable if slight early Hitchcock film that touches on some big topics like war. Not very suspenseful but the acting is good and in Robert Young's case the movie can be funny. Has of the master will want to see it and will probably enjoy it.",1120003200,2,3204,4.3743676222596966
630839,3,6303346359,"Ostensibly a spy thriller set during World War I, this 1936 Hitchcock film is filled with some over-the-top scenes which (unfortunately) may bring smiles rather than chills to the modern audience. Edgar Brodie (John Gielgud), a novelist returning from the war, is declared dead by his own government, given a new identity (Richard Ashenden) and passport, and ultimately sent back to Europe to find an enemy spy. With the charming Madeleine Carroll as his ""wife"" Elsa, Peter Lorre as a foreign general (with a Latin accent), and Robert Young as Robert Marvin, an American who flirts with Elsa, he arrives in Switzerland to discover his contact, a Swiss organist, dead. As he, Elsa, and the General travel from the mountains to the casino, a chocolate factory, and eventually by train toward Constantinople, looking for the enemy agent, Hitchcock keeps the viewer entertained with snappy scenes and dialogue but little real suspense.

Gielgud is cold and elegant as Brodie/Ashenden but lacks the heart which makes spies intriguing to an audience. Madeleine Carroll is warm and funny, Robert Young is charming (and would have made a great leading man here), and Peter Lorre is hilarious (perhaps unintentionally), stealing scene after scene. Lorre plays his part with a Spanish accent, an earring, curly dark hair, and rolling eyes, and it's hard, if not impossible, to believe that he's an assassin. The outdoor scenes are obviously painted, especially in a mountain climbing scene, and the action is melodramatic. The best and most natural scenes are the scenes in which Young flirts with Carroll, while Gielgud stews or looks confused. These scenes provide contrast with those in which Lorre, in real life a German, looks like a chubby assassin trying to sound ""Spanish.""

Hitchcock balances his serious scenes with scenes which offer some dark comic relief--Brodie's ""wake"" contrasting with a scene in which the butler casually carts off his empty casket, Gielgud and Lorre discovering a church organist's body and then having the church bells ring while they are hiding beside them in the bell tower, and Madeleine Carroll visiting politely with the wife of a man being assassinated while the wife's psychic dog howls loudly at the door. In major scenes the major characters wear clothing with sharp black and white contrasts, while lesser characters wear grays, and a constant prop throughout the film is the cigarette--even inside a sauna. Not very suspenseful, the film nevertheless has a surprise ending, and modern viewers will enjoy seeing this cast at work in this early Hitchcock film.

630840,3,6303346359,"A curious combination of actors and actresses make this pre-WW2 Hitchcock spy flick a B-level film.
The homely and genteel John Gielgud plays an English author whose death is faked during WW1 to set him up as a reluctant spy under an assumed name.  His mission is to proceed to Switzerland to uncover and thwart a German agent.  The beautiful and enthusiastic Madeleine Carroll is playing his wife.  Gielgud meets her in a hotel where she is conversing with a very youthful looking Robert Young.  Gielgud and Young eventually will vie for her affections.  Gielgud is aided by a horribly miscast Peter Lorre.  Lorre pays a phony Mexican general complete with curly black hair, a gold earring, prosthetic teeth and a terrible accent.
After killing the wrong man, Gielgud and Carroll show remorse and attempt to give up the spy game.  The unsympathetic Lorre coaxes Gielgud to continue to pursue the real villain in a memorable scene in a chocolate factory.
In summation, Hitchcock has done a far better job with similar subject matter in 39 Steps, Saboteur and Foreign Correspondent.",1038873600,7,1081,4.939226519337017

I found there to be very little chemistry between Gielgud and Carrol, and Peter Lorre seems determined to steal every scene he is in. The story was a bit thin as well.",1037923200,4,279,4.490196078431373
630842,3,6303346359,"This Laserlight edition of ""Secret Agent"" includes a short introduction by Tony Curtis.  Many Laserlight classics have an intro like this.  Mr. Curtis speaks for about 3 or 4 minutes, a few still photos and publicity shots are shown; its a welcome addition to a budget release.  Curtis' intros are sometimes very funny because he delivers his lines so awkwardly.
As for the movie itself... For a 1936 suspense thriller, it holds up pretty well.  Hitchcock fans won't want to miss it.  There is a lot of humor in this film, most of it courtesy of Peter Lorre, who steals the film as the General.
This edition of the film runs about 86 minutes.  I have seen video guides list the film as having a 93 minute running time.  I do not know if this version is incomplete, or if there is in fact a longer version available somewhere.  It wouldn't be the first time Laserlight has released a cut version (Hitchcock's ""Jamaica Inn"" was released with several minutes missing).  Maybe a future reviewer can shed some light on this mystery.",1005004800,17,1027,4.629834254143646

I was never a fan of Robert Young and he is particularly annoying in his role. The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5. I won't go into plot as has been done before. Based on Maugham's wartime service. Suggest buying the more inclusive book which I did. So, in effect, a quite good Hitchcock offering from his early British days.",1501372800,,600,4.3097345132743365
7844328,3,6303346359,"I have seen this film many times and I find it quite entertaining. In my opinion it is not as good as 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew too Much, A Lady Vanishes, and Young and Innocent, and yet, it is worth watching. Every scene is Hitchcockian, mixing humor with a little suspense and irony. It is also good to know that Robert Young plays the charming villain and Peter Lorre an assassin with a twisted sense of humor.

This Cobra Entertainment film makes a slight video and audio improvement above a previous alpha edition. One problem I had with the Alpha version was that a lot of the dialogue went too fast. This time I could hear and understand everything. Why is there an introduction by Tony Curtis? This is a mystery to me since there isn't much he can say about Hitchcock; he never worked with him in any movie that I recall. Nevertheless, given the fact that there is no other better copy of this movie out there (for example, Criterion), this Cobra Entertainment copy does a pretty good job.",1497830400,3,998,4.453551912568306

Honestly, this movie may be more like how real life spy work was during WWII, where agents were blundering around in foreign countries not really knowing what they were doing...but I don't really watch movies for reality. I want to see a movie where the hero/heroine are exceptional at what they do, I want them to be impressive and to be proud of the good things they do and the sacrifices they make for their country. I guess I want to be inspired. Call me a sap but there you have it. I don't say this very often, but when we were finished with the film we both wanted that part of our lives back. LOL.

7844331,3,6303346359,"Secret Agent, 1936 film

This is based on a play taken from the book ""Ashenden"" by Somerset Maugham. Maugham's book was a fictionalized story of his work as a British agent during the Great War; it was first censored and banned from publication. A British officer is sent to Switzerland to prevent a German agent from traveling to Arabia and getting them to revolt against British rule. We hear bombs from the German air force over London. Ashenden will take the place of the last British agent who died suddenly. His job is to find that German agent and stop his mission. Ashenden will be helped by the ""hairless Mexican"" (who has curly hair and isn't a Mexican), a mercenary called The General. Ashenden was given a wife to better hide his status in Switzerland.

An old man visits a store to buy chocolate. Outside he discards the candy to read a secret message telling him the British agent has arrived. Ashenden finds the contact has been silenced. We see scenes at the casino, where a man claims a lost button found by the dead organist. Ashenden figures him for the German agent, as this Englishman has a German wife. They arrange to go on a mountain climb. Back at the hotel Mrs. Ashenden spends time with the suspect's wife. Their dog senses something is wrong. Later they find they eliminated the wrong man. (Was it too easy?)

The General has discovered a secret German spy post, and they can now discover the German agent by visiting this chocolate factory. Their presence is reported to the police, but a fire alarm allows an escape. Their payoff allows them to get the name of the German agent. Now they must intercept Robert Marvin at the railroad station, or get on the train going to enemy territory. There is a dramatic confrontation, then an explosive ending to the train trip. The happy ending follows the moral conventions. [Was this echoed in ""From Russia With Love""?] This story illustrates why a secret agent needs a cover name and a low profile. A real spy would never be as well known as ""James Bond"".",1487721600,,2027,4.625
