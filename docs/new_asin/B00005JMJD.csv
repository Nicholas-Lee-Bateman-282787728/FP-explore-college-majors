1506847,5,B00005JMJD,"For starters, I'm a pretty big Plath-a-holic.  I saw this film at the sold out Cineworld Film Festival back in November and every time I've seen it since then, I've been blown away.
I liked the fact that the directors didn't make Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes to be wonderfully nice people, but they seemed to tone down all of the characters' worst qualities. Plath wasn't as rude as many biographers have made her out to be, and in the movie, Hughes had only one bona fide affair. Aurelia Plath, Sylvia's mother, was quite brash, but not portrayed as brashly as in most Plath biographies. Another Plath habit that wasn't included in the movie is that of Plath's dying her hair different colors when she was going through phases. Seeing that and maybe having a line or two of Hughes asking Plath why she dyed her hair would have been helpful in understanding Plath's transitions in mood.
As far as casting goes, I've long held the belief that Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect Sylvia Plath. The guy playing Ted Hughes was a bit too old for the beginning. The actress playing Aurelia Plath really confused me. She said things Aurelia Plath might have said, and mingled with the neighbors the way Aurelia Plath would have, but there was something missing.
Something I absolutely loved about this movie were little references to Plath. For instance, her license plate read ""AOK [and then some number]."" When she tried to make up with Hughes, they drank a bottle of Nuits St. Georges wine (referred to in The Bell Jar) in the vintage year 1959, the year when Plath really began to make poetic breakthroughs.
There were also camera shots here and there that I really liked. One shot featured Plath crying, and a teardrop was stuck at the tip of her nose. Another was of Plath in her bathtub, her pale face looking almost ghostly in the murky green water.
In general, I was pleased with Sylvia. If you know a lot about Plath, you'll probably be very happy with it. If you don't know too much about her real life, you'll probably just think it's okay.",1077408000,,2039,4.601648351648351
1506848,2,B00005JMJD,"Everyone knew going in that this was a weepy, which is fine, but there were not enough good qualities here to save this film. The script and direction was one-note and the result was boredom. A heaping helping of dreary melancholy. Not delicious.
The way this kind of movie usually works is to hint at great depth and beauty that cannot be reached in only 2 hours, thereby letting the audience's imagination fill in the details.
But the conversations here are too short and there's just not enough context to really care about these people.  There's no romantic joy in this film. Only struggle - to marry, to work, to write, to stay together.  So later when things go downhill all that one sees are these grim, morose figures, looking into oblivion.  I was looking at my watch.
In a dark forshadowing, so to speak, the Hughes/Plath estate refused to allow the producers to use any of their poems in the film. There goes the substance.. They really should have pulled the plug, but I guess they were too far along.",1077321600,4,1013,4.585635359116022
1506849,5,B00005JMJD,"SYLVIA is a film that appears to have disparate factions: those who are disappointed that the story is not about poetry and those who find the biography of a woman possessed of a progressively disintegrating mind sufficient.  Sylvia Plath is a poet who come into her own after her famous suicide - an act that was a reflection of her troubled life and failed previous childhood suicide attempt. Now her novel ""The Bell Jar"" and her most famous collection of poems ""Ariel"" have earned her a seat in the high echelon of American poets.  Would she have achieved that status were it not for her life as wife of the enigmatic poet Ted Hughes, with all the highs and lows that marriage afforded is a question that will never be answered.  But at least in SYLVIA we have a beautifully and lovingly rendered version of what happens in the poet's mind as directed by Christine Jeffs.
The entire cast is well selected and the performances are subtle, quality ones.  Gweneth Paltrow captures the fragility and paranoia/depression mind state of Plath as well as any actress could.  Her mother in the film is played to perfection by Blythe Danner, Paltrow's real life mother.  Ted Hughes is portrayed by Daniel Craig who manages to maintain our empathy despite the acts that on screen are seen as contributory to Plath's demise.  Those acts just happen to likewise have contributed to the content and flavor and message of her poems.
The cinematography is wondrous, illuminating not only the exteriors of London and Devon, England, but also exploring the interiors of the dark places Sylvia and Ted had lived. These dark places are wonderful metaphors for the spaces within the mind that comes unwound.  Yes, there may be other versions of Plath's life, especially now that Ted Hughes ""Birthday Letters"" were published recently just before Hughes dies.  But for the present SYLVIA  is a tribute, fair and dark and gentle, of a fine American poet.  Recommended.",1076716800,2,1947,4.851963746223565
1506850,5,B00005JMJD,"[...]
In this brilliant film about the life and death of one of America's most poignant poets, Sylvia Plath, the film takes a turn and looks at the triumph of suicide. In today's society suicide is often labeled with negative conations; but to poet Sylvia Plath, her death was a success. Sylvia Plath suffered with mental illness for years and as the days continued for her, daily life was harder to face. Death to her was salvation. Sylvia took her own life to save the lives of her children. For people to understand this concept, they must understand the destruction of a mental illness. By using her poetry this film tells the story of Sylvia's life. The film is an excellent depiction of the life of Sylvia Plath. Not only does this film brilliantly show her life, but it also looks deep inside the heartache of psychological sickness. This film shows the oppressiveness of Sylvia Plath's most important companion, Ted Hughes. The film illustrates Ted Hughes as a man who was filled with broken promises, which is a beautiful representation of the truth that is often not explained to followers of Sylvia Plath. This film is a story that should been seen and discussed especially by those who suffer mental illness. The film makes a person wonder about their own lives, yet at the same time gives a bit of hope and the strength to continue.",1076630400,,1345,4.703389830508475
1506851,4,B00005JMJD,"There was a point early on when I was struck by the thought of the degree to which the 2003 film ""Sylvia"" is burdened with our knowledge that in the end Sylvia Plath is going to stick her head in an oven in one of the most famous suicides of the 20th century.  The next thing I know Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig) is telling Sylvia (Gwyneth Paltrow) that to write poetry she just needs to pick a subject ""and stick her head in it.""  Ouch.
Of course the great irony is that Ted Hughes' infidelity inspired Plath's best work and her suicide made her immortal.  However, I would be inclined to think the admirers of Plath's poetry are going to be disappointed for two major reasons.  First, the screenplay by John Brownlow establishes from the beginning of the film the idea that Plath was a suicide waiting to happen.  A suicide attempt that almost succeeded before she went to college in England becomes the key to everything that happens follows and for those who have blame Hughes for Plath's death there is considerably less support for that idea than they might expect to see.  The precipitous event, if you would put your finger on one thing in the film, ends up being the pregnancy of the woman with whom he was having an affair.  The argument been that Plath killed herself because her husband had left her for another woman (a fellow poet named Assia Wevill, who was also married), but there is a certain ambiguity to the scene where Hughes speaks more of not being able to return.  You can see that in the film if you want to find it, but objectively the film puts most of the responsibility on Plath.  Nor does it point out that Wevill would eventually kill herself and the daughter she had by Hughes, using gas, just as Plath did, which certainly strike you as an additional condemnation as well.
Second, and this point applies more to those of us who are not really familiar with the poetry of either Plath or Hughes, the film is pretty much devoid of their work.  Frieda Hughes, Plath's daughter and literary executor, refused to cooperate with the producers of this film, specifically refusing to allow them access to her mother's poetry, and also publicly denounced the film in a published poem of her own: ""They think/ I should give them my mother's words/ To fill the mouth of their monster/ Their Sylvia suicide doll.""  Granted, it is difficult to make a film that captures the literary experience of writing, but it is certainly easier if you are dealing with poetry or drama (i.e., ""Shakespeare in Love"") than a novel.  I have to believe that this would have been a powerful film that celebrated Plath's creativity at the same time it depicts her hurtling towards death.
Plath's poems were passionate about death and I can well imagine those who have committed some of her poems to memory inserting them at the right points in the film.  Despite solid performances by Paltrow and Craig the end result is that ""Slyvia"" is an incomplete performance, smacking of voyeurism rather than an attempt at understanding.  This would be akin to watching ""Amadeus"" without the music of ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" without the paintings.",1076544000,5,3138,4.640794223826715

1507191,5,B00005JMJD,"Competent photographers and cinematographers take care that the light sources for their photography do not bounce from highly reflective surfaces into the camera lens. If, for example, a studio light reflects from a wall painted with high-gloss paint, it will be recorded on film as an annoying and distracting mass of glaring white behind the subject being photographed. It will overwhelm and disturb the balance, between foreground and background, that everyone expects in a good photographyand, as a result, make the viewer uneasy. The film director, Christine Jeffs, violates the convention again and again, especially in the rooms occupied by Plath and Hughes. It always reminds us, subliminally or otherwise, that things are out of kilter between these two principal characters. Such techniques are extremely effective at establishing this feeling. Some of the walls almost appear to be oiled. In addition to that, the walls are of the colors we associate with comic book art: garish but somber shades of green, blue, gray or yellow. It is an externalizing of an internal state: the descent, by Plath, into madnessor alternately, during Plath's manic moments of ecstasy, an ascent into it. If Ted Hughes goal in the movie is success, Sylvia Plaths goal seems to be death and the peaceful annihilation she believes it will bring. The rooms they inhabit are cramped, claustrophobic, and maze-like. They are abodes dreamed up in a nightmare. Even the sunniest outdoor scenes, and even the most optimistic encounters in their relationship, always present a sense of foreboding, peril and grief. The fine musical score contributes greatly to the effect, and it supplements the visuals perfectly.

However well or poorly the film conveys the actual life story of Plath, it is a brilliant piece of art. All the performances are engagingly convincing. Scenes in which Gwyneth Paltrows mother plays Plaths mother are fascinating. How a young, driven artist would interact with a highly cultured and sensitive mother is captured magnificently. Some Amazon reviewers have complained that Paltrows performance is shallow or flat. On the contrary, it is delivered with subtlety, nuance, and multiple layers of depth. Plath was a person torn by doubt and uncertainty, fluctuating between manic highs and desperately depressing lows. That one cant easily get a handle on the complexities of Plaths character may lead one to believe that she is not adequately revealed. But the important thing is that her inadequacies are sublimely well revealed. And that is the point of the movie.

This work of brilliance is intended to raise more questions than can be answered. It does not satisfy in the way nearly all movies do. Indeed, it is as unsatisfying and puzzling as real life so often tends to be. This film was designed to haunt the viewers consciousness, and it does. An anguished soul struggles for light, finds it (though still immersed in darkness), and loses it in death. That theres nothing neat about this story or its resolution is for many viewers unsatisfactory. For this viewer, this is cinematic art at its profoundest.",1395273600,2,3122,5.16798418972332

One must dig deep and really work arduously to find the perfect word and phrasing that touch the mind and penetrate the soul to create the artistry of every successful poem. Thinking and breathing metaphorically are absolutes. The dialogue in this film demonstrates this but much more than these spoken words is the unspoken, the raw guts of these phenomenal actors in this film. The difficult nearly painful task of writing from one's gut, from one's heart, is very evident in this film. At its core, the film is a love story of tragic proportion, a true story with a horrible end. The music in this film is mesmerizing as well.

However, I never knew this side to Plath. Never. And I studied literature in one of my undergraduate degrees. So I looked it up and realized it was true. . . people even hated Ted Hughes for his treatment of her. It showed me a new facet to Plath. I guess the literary world portrays her as a semi-feminist with a strong side. Yeah who can be classified as strong when they try to end their lives so many times right? But her writings had a strong tone. And to see that she was just another co-dependent mentally abused woman by a cheating spouse shocked me. Anyway it is worth your time. I guess I just missed this in the theatres as Paltrow seemed to have too many good movies for a while there that her performances all seemed to be the same (even though they were not) and I think the obsession with Plath's misery gets old . . . the glamorizing of it does . . . for me.

A horrible depressing life she led and sometimes even though he cheated, I cannot fault Ted for what he did. I think other things could have driven her to something as extreme as suicide. She needed things such as depression and horribleness in order to write ... as the movie seem to portray.

I wish they had gone into more of her past instead of just starting off when she had met Ted. The movie really didn't even explain why in detail or more ""show"" of how she decided to really make an effort to meet him or where had that brazen woman he met that night went.

And then she started smoking? Why? Why did she want to try new things and then she still killed herself?

Why couldn't she get herself off the ground? Maybe I want to understand too much about her and this movie certainly didn't answer enough questions about her, but made me more confused about the poet.

I really don't think it was affair or affairs that drove her to do what she did as the movie seemed to make it seem. I believe that had been inside of her long before she met Ted.

But it could've been me.

Yet, I believe Paltrow did a good job in portraying a lost tired soul gone before life could really begin and Craig did a good job portraying a man wanting to love a genius of a woman, who came and went emotionally, mentally and physically. Scary, but good.",1321660800,,1465,4.248201438848921
1507341,3,B00005JMJD,"The ambience created by Christine Jeffs in her 2003 film ""Sylvia"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig as married poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes uncomfortably cocoons the viewer within the darker recesses of the creative process gone wrong.  Through the use of shadowy lighting and stark locales, she invites the audience into a world where the feel of artistic angst associated with the uncertainty of breaking with the mainstream flow of life can become a tangible and destructive force.  Here, the paradox of finding the necessary solitude required to devote to one's art becomes equated with a paranoid sense of alienation that defeats all purposes.  With this in mind, realize from the get-go that ""Sylvia"" is not a happy film, but a biopic filled with the frustration of wasted life.

The soundtrack by Gabriel Yared emphasizes the film's overwhelming melancholy and dire, already known, outcome to the extreme; as the music uncomfortably meanders and soars, taking on a life of its own, it sets up the fatalistic mood so well that this reviewer and anyone else who isn't familiar with Plath's eventual suicide will indeed wince each time the tragedy motif begins to play. So effectively does it signal the quickening momentum of the pain to come for this member of the Dead Poet's Society.

After graduating from Smith College in 1955 and receiving a Fulbright Scholarship to Cambridge, Plath, eventual author of the novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bell-Jar/dp/0061148512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bell Jar</a>"" and two collections of poems ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Colossus-and-Other-Poems/dp/0375704469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Colossus and Other Poems</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ariel-Poems-by-Sylvia-Plath/dp/B000MPQ3F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ariel Poems by Sylvia Plath</a>,"" meets fellow poet Ted Hughes and falls madly in love.  The two passionately discuss poetry, unabashedly spout Shakespeare, and deliberately move forward into their lives together as married academics.  Nonetheless, despite the romantic rebelliousness of their intellectual pursuits, a bleak unhealthiness invades what could have been an idyllic partnership.

We get an inkling of the impending doom as Sylvia confides in Ted of a suicide attempt while in college where she crawled under her house after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The ""why"" of this is never explored within the content of the film.  Perhaps the expectations of her time force her spirit into a plummeting downward spiral. She is not alone in her pre-feminist 60's dilemma--being comfortable with the itch and angst associated with the artistic voice and yet desiring the conventional track of domestic happiness and contentment does not necessarily align well.

Already contemplating death before her meeting with Hughes, Plath suffers from the internal stress of not being quite good enough.  When compared to her husband she considers herself an amateur, immature poet where her inability to craft automatic gifted verse results in an obsessive bout of cake baking and many hours of introspective nothingness. Perhaps, Ted symbolizes some intrinsic struggle with being a member of the `second sex.'  Perhaps Plath as a fledgling poetess wanting to compete with her male counterparts succeeds only over time as she cultivates a rage and anger sufficient enough to measure with words. Maybe her real world accountability where the day-to-day moments of juggling teaching and raising children while managing her inner desires simply becomes too meaningless. Enjoying herself and life ventures into territory that is unknown when compared to the more complex desires of expressing a self she could not fully define.

Jeffs suggests all these images of Plath's shadow universe with dimly lit interiors, moody music and infinitely nuanced moments where Paltrow as Plath measures herself against Hughes in terms of her worthiness in different venues and social engagements with a wary arch of her neck and an angry pair of pressed-together lips.

Paltrow shines with the translucent insouciance of someone with great promise that is unaware of her possibilities.  As the character sinks into depression, Paltrow becomes more ethereal, a creature like Shakespeare's Ariel of whom Plath writes. Paltrow's maternal-automaton portrayal of Plath's last act of putting bread and milk out as breakfast for her children before she kills herself, as well as the slow motion blurring of the film death and discovery-of-the-body sequence suggests an ultimate `poetry in motion' that screams of Plath's defiance for that last tumultuous line of verse fleshing out a situation of which only she could irreparably control like no pen and ink poem ever could.  Clearly Hughes and his children were forever scarred.

John Brownlow's screenplay focuses on Hughes' infidelity with Assia Wevill (who became Hughes second wife and ironically also committed suicide) and Plath's almost paranoid concern that Hughes' popularity as a poet and an attractive man with a ""come-hither"" accent made him a magnet for women of all shapes and sizes.  But as Plath already struggled with her self-worth or the seemingly meaninglessness of the world, the trigger of Hughes' popularity and subsequent flirtations seems only a surface diagnosis to the real problem at hand which is never really explored within the film.

Why Plath felt the way she did will never be fully understood.  Her repeated attempts at suicide as depicted in her novel ""The Bell Jar"" are not touched upon in this film.  Perhaps flashbacks depicting her life as a child with her parents, her mental state during her guest editorship at Mademoiselle magazine, her overdose of pills and her commitment to a mental facility prior to meeting Hughes would have rounded out her story and not put the sole blame of her melancholy on Hughes, his celebrity, his philandering and her dissatisfaction with her marital life.

As there is a lot of emotional ground to cover in the two hour running time of this film, much emphasis is placed on the dysfunctional relationship between Hughes and Plath.  Nonetheless as this is a story about literary figures, it seems strange that the only time either of the pair waxes poetic in the film is to recite some other poet's work.  The audience gets to hear some of ""Daddy,"" but otherwise hears nothing of the works of either Plath or Hughes.  On that purely literary level, hearing some of Hughes ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birthday-Letters-Poems/dp/0374525811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birthday Letters: Poems</a>"" verse or Plath's posthumous ""Ariel"" would have placed the audience in their mindspace where from individual perspectives would have come better understanding of the whole angst-ridden tale.

Bottom line?  ""Sylvia,"" directed by Christine Jeffs, deals with a somber theme that is sure to depress even lovers of the poetry of Sylvia Plath and poet Laureate Ted Hughes.  Melancholy music and dimly lit spaces create an ambiance of overwhelmingly ill-fated disaster that portrays the dark side of genius in an extreme albeit ethereal way that suggests rather than defines Plath's ultimate motive.  The dialogue of the film severely lacks recitation of either of the poets' works but good performances by Gwyneth Paltrow, Daniel Craig and Blythe Danner convince the audience to remain seated until the film's bleak climax.  Recommended only to those who want to wallow inside Plath's complex mindset.

1507342,2,B00005JMJD,"I was really looking forward to seeing a movie about the life and death of the famous Sylvia Plath, but I found this movie to be ultimately unsatisfying.  I guess one major problem I have with it is that it does not show her life in New York City which ultimately became the basis for THE BELL JAR, her most compelling work.  Although I liked the reading of her poems throughout the movie, the focus on her life with Ted Hughes I didn't like.  Ted Hughes was the last influence in her life; she had many major influences before she met him.",1279843200,,540,4.2745098039215685
1507472,4,B00005JMJD,"The film Sylvia deals with the second half of poet Sylvia Plath's life, primarily on her marriage and motherhood and final great creative efforts. It is a tragic tale. It is tragic for within the wonderful creative person is growing depression, anxiety, and suspicion.  The film reminds us that the human condition is fragile despite the strength and brilliance of creativity and genius. Of course there has been much back and forth around who was right and who was wrong in the Ted Hughes-Sylvia Plath marriage. I must say that the film is extremely fair and even-handed, never fully taking the part of Hughes over Plath or Plath over Hughes.

It is extremely difficult to make an interesting movie about a depressed creative genius and at least this film attempts to explore the untreated clinical depression that plagued Plath and made her life miserable and drove her husband away.  What a complete tragedy that the artist found that the very quality within her that was making her miserable also drove away the person she loved most and thus even made her more miserable.  Is there any character in mythology who found that the more they approached the beloved, the more the very act of approach drove the beloved away?  This was the dilemma that Plath faced.

I was also touched by the struggle that Plath underwent being pulled into the world of the living by her children, her guilt about leaving them motherless, and yet the depressed undercurrent continually pulling her into the land of the dead.  There is a scene of almost unspeakable pain where Plath puts her children in a car and drives to the ocean where she plans to drown herself. She looks back at the car before walking into the rough surf and sees the tiny innocent eyes of her children watching her every move.  She just could not kill herself at that point and reluctantly and defeated she returns to the world of the living.

Yet there is a flaw in the film that is difficult to address. For basically we see a terrible tragedy of a depressed woman lose her husband through jealousy and insecurity and then finally commit suicide and yet we only get a few glimpses of her brilliance. What a struggle her life must have been and yet there were periods of great creativity as evidenced by her life's work
Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job and is perfectly matched by Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes.  The photography and art direction are a concert in gray and black, moody colors to match the brooding depression in Sylvia's mind.",1251676800,2,2498,4.695652173913044

1507474,3,B00005JMJD,"I was concerned when I saw that Paltrow had been cast as Plath, so I avoided seeing this movie for years because I was sure she alone would derail the movie. How wrong of me - it's not that Paltrow isn't miscast, it's that the Plath she's playing isn't quite true to life. Paltrow actually does an excellent job with what she's given.

What's missing? Well, Plath's breezy, bright qualities are almost completely absent, save for some quick scenes at the beginning of the movie that only serve as a quick opportunity to show us how smitten she was with Hughes.

The movie also implies that, during her marriage, she was unable to write and when separated from Ted, she's seen scribbling furiously as though she's finally able to work on the poetry she was destined to unleash. It's clear that her later poems are her strongest because she's tapped into an energy she had not yet realized she possessed, but to imply that her married years weren't fruitful is to be unfair both to Plath and to Ted Hughes. Whether Plath fans like it or not, Sylvia looked to her husband as a mentor (even when she might have been jealous of her success) and he at least played a part in helping her to shape her voice as a writer.

This is a movie that would be critiqued widely no matter how accurate or carefully put together, but it feels like the script focuses on the great hurts inflicted upon Plath both by her mind and by her husband. Her life wasn't easy, but turning it into a spurned-wife melodrama simplifies a woman who was much deeper than that. It's possible to portray Hughes as the villain that he was while also making a movie that glosses over what draws us to Plath the most: her wonderful creative energy.",1215216000,,1708,4.485530546623794

Many incidents were confusing.  It leaned on the tragic and pathetic version of Plath's life.  For a movie about Sylvia Plath there seemed to be a lot about her association with Hughes, little about her as an individual.  The film, without prior knowledge of her life could be misleading at times.  Plath was explosive (artistically, as well as emotionally) well before she ever met Hughes.

But Gwenyth Paltrow did such a great job trying to capture a complex person that seeing it once would not hurt. Just remember it is a Hollywood movie trying to titilate with a skewed story of a ""mad"" woman.",1209081600,,785,4.4475524475524475
1507477,4,B00005JMJD,"I'd have given this movie 3 stars if it weren't for the brilliant performances of its cast. Despite an unforgettable portrayal from Gwyneth Paltrow of a haunted, tormented soul in a performance that is almost disturbing, the film glossed over Sylvia Plath's relationship to her art while focusing mainly on her relationship to her husband, poet Ted Hughes.

The movie version showed collaboration between the two poets only during their courtship phase, with Sylvia losing touch with her art shortly after her marriage. However, biographies of Sylvia stress how, for several years during her marriage, and before its collapse, there had been a period of productivity and fruitful collaboration between her and her poet husband, where they both helped, encouraged and inspired one another. The relationship the-movie-Sylvia had with her poetry seemed marginal, and after her marriage, nearly non-existent.

Was it that the film-makers, with eyes on the box-office, feared to ""alienate"" their average customers with any emphasis on poetry, so they decided to flatten out the story, believing that focusing on her mental disturbance and putting ""that bit about art"" on the backburner would sell better? Or was it simply that Hollywood is completely out of its depth whenever there is any depth to be dealt with?

So, the-movie-Sylvia was this deeply disturbed woman, jealous of nearly everything her husband did, and her own relationship with poetry and her work was skimmed over and presented in a most superficial manner. Daniel Craig's performance was sophisticated, leaning more towards the portrait of an estranged husband rather than a womanizing scoundrel. Other supporting cast were excellent.

If viewers didn't know much about Sylvia Plath, the impression they would get from this movie would be that she was a mentally disturbed soul, but not a serious artist. A sad distortion, with the performance of its cast as its only saving grace.",1206489600,2,1945,5.284789644012945
1507478,3,B00005JMJD,"In her effort to avoid blaming the much-maligned Ted Hughes for Sylvia Plath's 1963 suicide, the director of ""Sylvia"" reduces the period covering Plath's graduate studies at Cambridge University, her marriage to Hughes, the birth of their two children, and Plath's descent into morbid depression and suicide, to a series of rapid brushstrokes.  These brushstrokes, unfortunately, are too shallow to convey the complexity of Plath's relationship with Hughes, let alone her relationship with the emotional demons that had haunted Plath since puberty.  The problem is, this shallowness not only doesn't tell the whole truth, it alters it.

Absent from the film is Sylvia's tortured psychological relationship with the father she lost at the age of eight; her equally complex relationship with her emotionally repressed mother is barely referenced (the scene in which the beautiful Blythe Danner, as Sylvia' mother, tells Hughes that Sylvia loves him because he's the only man she's ever been afraid of, as all other men have been afraid of her, is totally out of character given even a passing knowledge of Aurelia Plath); Sylvia's unrealistic yearnings toward men and marriage as expressed through her dogged search for the perfect Uber-Mate who was part Great Hunter/part Great Poet; Hughes's complex relationship with his sister, Olwyn, with whom Plath felt intensely competitive; Hughes's propensity to occasional violence; and, lastly, Hughes's willingness to allow Plath's more overt ambition to serve his work as well, while he posed as the purer spirit who didn't care whether his work was published or not.  It is a great irony that Hughes went on to become Poet Laureate of England, because Plath devoted herself as much to circulating his work as hers in the early years of their marriage, in a way that he either was not willing or organized enough to do.  It is doubtful that Hughes would have gotten as well known as he did, as early as he did, without her efforts.  Sylvia, in her unabashed ambition, was as quintessentially American as Hughes was quintessentially English in his public demurral of ambition.  Because of her ambition, her obvious desire to marry Hughes, and the intense emotional persona that many had observed, Hughes's friends were stunned at his choice.  This reviewer has always suspected that Hughes found Plath so attractive because her ambition served as a shield behind which he could hide his own.

The bottom line is that neither of these two intense, gifted, and unusual people was a bed of roses to live with.  Yet we see in the film only that Sylvia is riddled with suspicion about her husband's fidelity, that she suffered from some writer's block at one point that caused her to be jealous of his steady output, and that suddenly her fears re his infidelity materialized.  The film doesn't make clear which came first: her increasingly bizarre behavior, or his increasing loss of interest in the marriage and in sustaining an emotionally unstable partner.  In an extraordinarily bitchy memoir, Dido Merwin, who got to know the couple when they moved permanently to England, places the blame for Hughes's defection from the marriage with Asia Wevill squarely on Plath's suspicions, which Merwin clearly felt drove Hughes to shrug his shoulders and act on those suspicions - a monstrously oversimplified view that absolves Hughes of any responsibility for how he handled the mounting tensions in his marriage.

In addition to searching for the Uber-Mate, Plath was obsessed with being one.  By all accounts she was an attentive mother and an accomplished cook and housewife.  When she wasn't parenting, laundering, cleaning, and cooking, Plath found time to write some more than respectable poetry, her one novel (""The Bell Jar"", published first under the pen name Victoria Lucas), and keep her own work and that of her husband's (she retyped all his manuscripts) in constant circulation.  And, while Hughes's adoration of their first child, Frieda, is included in the film, his peculiar resentment and emotional distance from their second child, Nick, is not.

By the time the Hughes's moved to the countryside in Devon, Plath had gone from a striking and vibrant, if troubled blonde, to a dowdy, harried mother with long brown braids, trying to keep bees, grow flowers and vegetables, run a large house with few modern conveniences, care for two small children, and, in the few hours before dawn she could call her own, write.  The house was nearly impossible to heat - in winter the indoor temperature settled in the mid-40 degrees and Plath was constantly sick.

The film does not illustrate Plath's lifelong penchant for unrealistic idealizations - she plunges eagerly into the idea of English country life without weighing the intellectual consequences of isolation from the cultural stimulation of London and its literary life, or the cost to her writing in time spent running the large, old country house, its kitchen gardens, etc. - much as Plath did not stop to think about the consequences of marrying a stunningly charismatic (ask any woman who heard Hughes read in his prime), gifted, equally complex, husband with a surprisingly old-fashioned view of marriage.  The realities of the move to Devon, in my opinion, dealt a crushing blow to the Hughes marriage, from which it never recovered.

Gwyneth Paltrow, bland and fashionably anorexic looking as ever, is woefully miscast as the statuesque, fiery, and deeply disturbed Sylvia. She just doesn't have the candlepower to be plausible as the woman who wrote ""Ariel"".  Daniel Craig, a better and more charismatic actor than Paltrow, does well as far as he's allowed to as Ted Hughes, it's just that he isn't allowed to go too far.  But Craig is also somewhat miscast - with all due respect, despite the dyed dark hair, Craig is fair and on the short side.  Most of the time I am not wedded to exact verisimilitude in these matters.  But those who have read widely about her know that the 5'9"" Plath was nearly obsessed with finding a tall, rugged man as her mate, and that the very tall, dark Hughes seemed tailor-made to her eyes (""And then I saw him, that big, dark, hunky boy, the only one there huge enough for me"" as she excitedly described him in her journal after seeing Hughes for the first time at that fatal party in Cambridge).  To ignore these portions of Plath's psyche is to eliminate crucial pieces of the puzzle of why she chose who she did, and why things turned out the way they did.  Craig is intense and intelligent, and not exactly lacking in erotic appeal, but, nevertheless, he was the wrong actor for this part.  The more you know about these two writers, the less these two actors fit the bill.

There are, finally, simply too many unaccounted-for gaps in ""Sylvia"" between what happened and why.  In order to fill in those gaps, Jeffs would have had to make a different, more complex film, one in which Plath and Hughes are each shown as much less sympathetic, but far more dimensional.  All we have here is a rushed cartoon that adds up to the ""Cliff Notes On The Last Years Of Sylvia Plath.""",1206316800,5,7123,4.950503355704698

From that standpoint it accomplishes it's mission. After all isn't that the goal of a film (or book)?  I thought Gwyneth Paltrow did a steller job of communicating the small amount of joy and great dispair in Ms. Plath's life. IF the film is ""spot on"" with the facts of their life together there is NO QUESTION that Mr. Hughes CAN be blamed for Sylvia's demise. She wanted to go back to Devon and start over, and was in fact excited with the prospect of doing so. Mr. Hughes was not. Mr. Hughes KNEW he had deeply hurt her, and knew of her past attempts, so WHY DID HE LEAVE HER?  If I loved someone like that I would NOT leave them this way.

1507480,5,B00005JMJD,"There have always been the pro-Plath and pro-Hughes groups stemming from their complex relationship and the evolving feminist movement; but 'Sylvia' breaks free from this divide, and tells the story of frustrated artists and their complex, emotion-laden relationships.

The film evolves or devolves brilliantly: from the sun filled and idealist Sylvia, to the love-damaged and obsessive Sylvia, taking her own life. The characters are beautifully portrayed without bias, and paves the road for one of Gwyneth Platrow's best performances in her career: almost embodying Plath's descent into despair. There are  moments in 'Sylvia' - portrayed so delicately by Paltrow - which are almost unbearable to watch. Daniel Craig supports well with his three-dimensional portayal of Hughes, and the cinematographer appropriately paints the tones from warm and sunny, to cold and monotonous with her eventual suicide.

Not a feel good film, I must confess (suicide is after all a grim affair); but the film is well directed by Christine Jeffs, and Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is simply astonishing. Well worth watching.",1198108800,3,1110,5.556213017751479
1507578,4,B00005JMJD,"Sylvia is a movie about the last 1/3 or so, of iconic American poet Sylvia Plath's life.  The movie begins when Sylvia is studying in Britain on a scholarship.  In the beginning, we watch as Sylvia Plath encounters harsh reviews of her writing and then the man whom would play a huge role in her demise, famed British poet Ted Hughes.  The rest of the movie depicts the married life of Ted and Sylvia, which I think would have been a more appropriate title for this movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow does a fantastic job of portraying the volatile emotions of Sylvia Plath.  On one hand loving her man with a burning intensity not very often displayed by women.  On the other hand, she is extremely jealous and has outbursts when she feels unloved or disrespected by Ted.  Finally, we see the demise of Sylvia when Ted leaves her, and how she struggles with inner demons in the last days of her life, culminating in her suicide.

I don't agree with a previous reviewer that this movie is only meant for Plath fans.  There is fantastic acting and quite a bit of depth to each of the characters.  I personally would have liked to see a more well-rounded portrayal of Sylvia and ALL of her relationships during this time, including her strenous relationship with her mother, and her near affair with publisher Alvarez.  All in all, I thought the movie was good, but it left me longing for a more wholistic view of the great, late Sylvia Plath.",1187827200,,1430,4.546875
1507579,5,B00005JMJD,"A powerful and well-intentioned film, with a great cast.

If I have a problem, it is that the portrayal of Hughes is a little generous, and there was no real attempt to get inside Plath's head. We know the what and the how, but there was no real attempt to explain the why.

Nor was there any mention of the fact that, in 1969, Assia gassed herself and her daughter to death - even as a footnote.

Plath was one of the finest poets of all time, yet all we ever hear in the movie are tiny fragments of her genius.

""The Hours"", featuring an inspired Nicole Kidman, did a far better job on the life of Virginia Woolf, but that is no fault of a superb Paltrow and Craig, who did everything they could with what they had to work with.

Great performances throughout, but the film could have been way deeper.",1184976000,,803,4.222222222222222
1507580,4,B00005JMJD,"""Sylvia"" does a solid job of communicating the tragedy of Plath's life to devoted readers and the average viewer alike: Gwyneth Paltrow gives a notable performance as the disturbed, intense, and tragically flawed poetess who, with only two collections of verse, changed the face of modern poetry and never lived to bask in the fruits of her own greatness.

Since Plath's suicide a lot of baseless assumptions have been made from her work and certain aspects of her tumultuous, but very accomplished, life: the most absurd of which is that husband and poet Ted Hughes was somehow responsible for her self-immolation.  If only it were that simple.

As shown very candidly in this film, Sylvia Plath was a woman with the ambition of a Caesar and the ego of Alexander the Great.  The unrelenting pressure she put on herself to produce poetry (without which we might not have ""Daddy"", ""Ariel""?) may have accelerated whatever imbalance she had to begin with.  Before she even met Hughes a serious suicide attempt had been made.  Her intensity was painful and frightening.

Not that the marriage helped--Hughes was a womanizing alcoholic who was more than willing to set aside ethical qualms to satisfy his slightest whims.  In later life this all caught up to him and he developed something of a conscience, but by then it was far too late and he had left two dead women and one murdered child in his wake.

This movie gets very dark very fast, as you might expect.  At the beginning, though, we are treated to a realistic and vivid portrayal of two great poets meeting one another in the heat of the muse's grip: reciting poetry with the speed of a computer, obsessing over every second that passes without a word written, and flinging verses at each other, some of them medieval and archaic.

Another reviewer said there ""wasn't much of the writing"" in the film.  I'd have to disagree.  While Hughes poems and Plath's poems aren't given exclusive attention, we hear Chaucer, Yeats, Lowell, and hosts of other poets referenced and quoted continually.

Even with the contagious romanticism of the film and of the poet's lives,
Plath and figures like her (Anne Sexton, Virginia Woolf, and similar male poets) have left some very dangerous and negative stereotypes as a result of their self-destruction.  Decadence is miserable and not creative in the slightest.  Poetry is particularly prone to this myth.  After the movie I wondered: what if Plath had thought about her poetry before she stuck her head in that oven?  Or her children?  Imagine what poetry we would have today.  All that aside, this is definitely a worthwhile film for anyone interested in the life of a real poet.",1182470400,3,2674,4.848017621145375
1507581,2,B00005JMJD,"The facts of the matter of Ted and Sylvia are well known, this movie presents them soberly, there are no cranky theories on offer (she may be the only American celebrity the CIA did not murder). On the surface what happened is banal, a marriage which went quickly wrong, and her left with two little kids. If we glance back through time 40 years we will find ""Poor Cow"" tells the same story. That was fiction, this story is not. But the genre known as the biopic tends towards the cartoon (Ah, Wilde, let me introduce you to my friend Whistler. I'm sure you'll find him most amusing... So, Oliver Cromwell, we meet at last.) and this portrait of Sylvia Plath in pre-feminist, pre-swinging 60s, pre-rock, pre-nearly everything late 1950s England, trapped like a bird in a house flying bang into the windows time and again trying painfully to escape, veers close to pure caricature.

Sample dialogue :

Sylvia : How was your walk?

Ted: Good. I got a poem. A good one.

Sylvia: I'm dried up.

Ted: Cause you've got nothing to say.

Sylvia: I'm no good.

Ted: You make great cakes.

Cue great offstage feminist moaning and gnashing. Then Ted says some useful blokeish things - ""There's no secret to it (writing poetry - they never talk about anything else), you just have to pick a subject and stick your head into it."" Sylvia retorts : ""You go out for a bike ride and come back with an epic in hexameters - I sit down to write, I get a bake sale."" A little later, on their honeymoon, they're in a dinghy rowing in the sea when Ted suddenly realises - he's out of his depth! (""the tide's dragging us out - I can't get us back in... people drown like this..."") Heavy handed metaphor? Yes, I think so! And so under waves of risible dialogue like that, the movie slowly sinks whilst the captain stands bravely on deck saluting to the last - that would be Gwyneth Paltrow, who gives a fine performance, but what can even she do?

Middle aged woman to Ted after his lecture : Mr Hughes, your voice is so.... powerful.

Ted : But what did you think of the words?

Middle-aged woman (blankly) : ....the words?

Cue Sylvia smiling ironically. Cue audience rolling eyes and nudging each other - ""I reckon there's Trouble Ahead!"" Yes, we get it. Ted's a wow with the ladies. So it seems that these big name high toned poets have relationships which turn on exactly the same thing as Den and Angie - the tedious negotiations of sexual fidelity, or as Leonard Cohen gracefully put it, ""the homicidal bitching that goes down in every kitchen to determine who shall serve and who shall eat"". And this justifiable sexual and creative jealousy is given to us as the whole cause of Sylvia's misery. Her extremely disturbed adolescence is alluded to twice but never examined.

Sylvia Plath was a prisoner - of the 1950s and its common or garden sexism, of Ted Hughes, of her own ambition, of her marriage, of her children, and she was in an almost permanent rage. The only time she captured and channelled this rage was in the six month burst of energy in late 62 and early 63 when she wrote the Ariel poems, which collectively form one of the essential documents of the 20th century. This really unnecessary film cannot illuminate what happened. It peers at the photogenic surfaces. What was Ted thinking? What about Sylvia's friends - we only see one, Al Alvarez - had she scared them off? Why did she become suicidal? Was she born like that, as some people are born junkies? What the hell was she thinking, with her two little kids in the next room? This was no ordinary despair. Is this movie for those who haven't read Sylvia or those who have? Either group would have many complaints. They'd be better off reading Ariel and Janet Malcolm's book ""The Silent Woman"".",1163289600,10,3749,4.52810650887574

Unfortunately I think that in order to show more complex real-life characters, film makers *must* frame them in the context of their romantic relationships primarily. A film just draws more attention that way.

That is where where I was left wanting in this...that I didn't believe that it was jealousy that unravelled her, or that had he ""made her happy"" she would not have killed herself. The illness was there, and the death of her father brought it to the surface for the first time. It was a disease.

The fascinating thing about the disease of mental illness, is that the same thing that disconnects a person from the world around them, seems to be the thing that enables them to be extra sensitive to other sensations, and maybe to their own inner workings as well. My favorite line of the movie is when she says that the truth loves her. She sees more.

I think that we're learning more and more that it is a myth to think that a person cannot be creative or tap into genius without continually slipping into insanity, or risking it. I'd like to see more exploration of the topic in film though.",1158624000,10,1295,4.545064377682404

This movie acted as if Sylvia Plath was just another talented but frustrated, abused or not terribly abused,-- housewife who would be a fine poster girl for all the politically correct clichs that dull academics could spout about how it is such a pity, endemic to our sexist and corrupted society, that such a talented, attractive young woman should have suffered so severely from society's blindness....blah blah

Millions of women fit that description but Sylvia Plath did not belong in that category since she was that terrible angel or terrifying beast which no one can comprehend and who scares the hell out of people for her sheer brillance: a true genius,

a person who makes the average mediocre bystander or reader feel small just by her sheer presence,brilliance and especially through her poems which are the pearls or the rubies or the diamonds --(it's hard to say which stones since diamonds are discredited these days)-- but let's just say the most ideal gem that we can imagine.

Now, each time I see another of her films or watch one of her older films again, I have more respect for Glynneth P. as an actress--(that's one more thing that really bothers me: why on earth can't we say 'actress' any more?

Anyone with eyes can see that most actresses,and especially Glynneth, are very beautiful and feminine women so why not say actress?  Does everyone have to hate them because they are so much more attractive than their ""fans?"")

Finally (almost),so that this does not go on any longer, I would have given this film 5 stars or more for the acting and for many technical things like the directing, camera work, sound, etc.  But since the movie missed the point, I can only give it a 4 since it lost most of the impact it should have had but it was a worthy attempt at an impossible project: to get people to look clearly at her life, a terrifying prospect for most people.

Now, the question is: why didn't people like it?  Obviously few people are ready to really confront the horror of her life as I just said.

We like everything to be romanticized so it makes sense that most would like to turn her life into a little tale with a convenient moral.  I

t would be more interesting to face the fact that although she did try to kill herself and came quite close many times (no one realizes how difficult it really is to kill oneself or another (unless you use some means which puts a lot of distance between yourself and the victim or use something which seems less shocking like slow poison.  Old time wars and attacks took men with both strong arms and very strong stomachs.))

To close without going into too many gory details, why did she suffer so?  And by what miracle did she produce those poems (not all of them but many) which have such power to produce powerful positive effects in her readers?

What genius did she have and, above all, more importantly, what type of amazing inner strength and drive to express herself did she develop which enabled her to leave us her gems of limitless worth before her tragic end?",1153180800,2,3538,4.5664556962025316
1507587,5,B00005JMJD,"Sylvia is a powerful and haunting film by director Christine Jeffs. Poet Sylvia Plath portrayed by the always great Gwyneth Paltrow struggles with suicides, depression, her insecuirty as a writer and a wife is all discussed here. This movie touches me to the core and i am not sure why. Something about it is so auhtentic and disturbing. Plath meets and falls in love with another poet Ted Hughes, after a 4-month courtship they decide to marry and continue working on their individual writings. Hughes exceles greatly as a poet while Plath struggles with poem after poem trying to find a ""theme."" Although much of the film's focus doesn't focus heavily on Plath's gorgeous poems, it focuses more on Plath's self-destructive marriage to Hughes. Their love for eachother is evident but eventually becomes strained by Plath's ever-growing worry that Hughes is unfaithful to her, which ultimately becomes a ironic reality. I am a huge fan of Sylvia Plath, she was gifted, torturted by the death her beloved father at nine, and still her loneliness and self-doubt could not be overcomed with her genius and her love for her two young children. Paltrow is perfect as always in her fragile portrayal of Plath. Plath would go on to sell million copies of her best volume of poetry ""Ariel"" but Plath would not be witness to any of this success, she killed herself on February 11, 1963 by lighting the oven and inhaling the fumes. If you are a fan of Plath, i highly recommend watching this film, great cinematography, great acting, and great story. Enjoy!",1145404800,2,1547,4.863636363636363
1507727,4,B00005JMJD,"Not a bad movie, though, like Plath's life as well, it is very depressing, however it is good that such a movie was made, despite protests from Frieda Hughes and the overall opinions of critics. Personally, I feel that Paltrow, who had fought to get the movie made, had made a good decision in taking on such a project, and, although some may argue otherwise, she did accurately portray Plath. (If you do not believe me then I strongly suggest you pick up her UNABRIDGED journals)

However, I was disappointed that this movie was more concerned with her relationship with Hughes than her entire life. Possibly it would be better if a screen adaptation of The Bell Jar was made, since it is not only a great piece of literature, but was also widely received in America during it's publication and, if anything (not to sound redundant), but America is probably fairly more willing to view psychotic breaks and suicide today and would be well received by many.

I was very surprised to find that Paltrow's portrayal of Sylvia Plath was, for the most part, somewhat one-dimensional.  One does not really see the depth of emotion in Paltrow's performance that one would get from reading Plath's poetry.  The show really belongs to Daniel Craig, who, in most of his movies, achieves a sense of being the ""mystery man.""  His Ted Hughes is fantastic, but the film tries to work around taking sides here.  Many have blamed Hughes for Plath's eventual suicide, but the film tries to remain neutral, only making things a bit confusing.  Are we supposed to like Hughes?  Are we supposed to believe that he was the cause of her death?  Remember, too, that Plath had already tried to commit suicide twice before.  This seems to be one of the faults in John Brownlow's writing.  Everyone but the actors seem new to film; Christine Jeffs has only directed one other film, and Brownlow has written for television, but not for film.  One of the other faults to this film is bringing in actors like Blythe Danner and Michael Gambon and not giving them a worthwhile part.  Danner does work hard at her small role as Plath's mother, as does Gambon as the downstairs neighbor, but anyone could really have done these jobs.  When I see extremely talented actors like Gambon and Danner, I expect to see greatness, not small bit parts.  Other than these problems, the story was decent, and Craig's acting carried the movie.  I wish Focus Features could have delivered something a bit better, but all I have seen is a decent, so-so adaptation of the life of Sylvia Plath.",1142294400,7,1768,4.639871382636656
1507729,4,B00005JMJD,"Nietszche stated once: ""The age of marriage arrives before the age of loving each other."" Perhaps we may find the clues to intend to comprehend and even approximate us to the horrid existence of a generous, sensitive and sensible personality of this brilliant poetry, whom love definitively did not take into account. Maybe such prodigious talent must pay a prize: to shine and illuminate other touching sensibilities gratifying excessively what that soul lacked: affection and love.

The blackness of the night; the horror of despair, of loving and not being corresponded, the dark brumes of the solitude, the hell of living inside a decreasing circle, struggled by disillusion and all kind of humiliations in live flesh with all the cruel intensity a sensitive soul can bear. Day after day  Sylvia Plath walked to that flame, with fears but with lucid resolution, until a day the living will was defeated.

Gwyneth Paltrow made a very exquisite performance around this demanding role; the varied gamut of emotional features was shown with admirable realism, facial grimace, illumination, hairdressing and expressive close ups that accented that dramatic anima state.

When you love and (she or he) does not, you will understand the desert at just three steps of water.",1137715200,,1270,5.180487804878049
1507730,4,B00005JMJD,"The fudemental truth about Sylvia Plath was that her life almost constantly balanced between creation and destruction. Paltrow gets a sense of this across but only to the degree that we see how this ingrained trait destroyed her relationship with Hughes and ultimatey her. Paltrow gives a credible performance as I feel the sense of lacking derives from a ""phase"" focussed script, that is that the script looks solely at the struggles of the Hughes/Plath relationship and their need to both achieve in the literary world and steer a smooth personal course which gave both what they needed. The film pays lip service to Sylvia's sense of early loss and the damage this inflicted on her adult personality, which in my estimation, left her feeling half a soul and half a bleak and empty vessel filled only with pain and pointlessness. In this sense the potrayal, intense as it is, displays a woman who is desperately needy and at times intensely irritating and fickle, for no apparant reason.

 A woman who seemingly sows the seeds of her own destruction, with little sense of the root of her desperate and highly damaged sense of self, to add this dimension would have done Plath more credit.

 The portayal from script, of Hughes is infinitely more sympathetic and one feels a truer sense of his attempt to provide Plath with all she her needs, and the growing realisation that this is impossible and that he will fall foul of her focussed destruction and seemingly powerless to change it, it seems here his affair was almost inevitable. An interesting point which would have displayed the toxicity of Plaths inner most destruction is that the woman Hughes left her for killed herself and her daughter just three years after Sylvia died.

 As good as Paltrow is I could not help feel an older actress may have brought the sense of who and why Sylvia was rahter just give us a one dimesional portrayal of her destruction and creation. But I imagine her in lies the quandry since Plath was just 31 when she died so to give the role to say a Meryl Streep just would not work chronologically. Craig's performance was the better of the two for me, so intensley studied as to get both the accent and sound of Hughes absolutely perfect.

 A worthy attempt all round, nonetheless, to convey some of what was an enormously interesting and tortured life.",1137283200,,2343,4.73955773955774

There is some discussion of a previous suicide attempt, but no reasons for her behavior were discussed.  One can only assume that she had a bi-polar personality, but perhaps it was something else.

There should have been more depth to the characters in the movie.

Paltrow went way overboard, in my opinion, in a classic example of overacting in practically every scene.  On top of that, the music was so loud most of the time that the dialog could not be heard above the din.

A bad production, and a poor screenplay.  Don't waste your time on this one.",1132704000,2,651,4.560344827586207

I disagree with most reviewers, however, as regards Gwyneth Paltrow's acting.  I just don't see her doing any.  She is simply being Gwyneth Paltrow, a little strung out.  Her Sylvia is glamorous, willowy, beautiful in a contemporary way that the real Plath was not.  The film constantly changes facts slightly to support this portrayal.  In real life, for instance, Plath and her children were staying with friends until the night before her suicide.  The film shows her calling people frantically asking if she can come around and visit and being turned down.  I guess the image of lovely Gwyneth crying in a phone booth is more arresting than that of Sylvia Plath surrounded by concerned friends, which she was.

1507734,5,B00005JMJD,"Making films based on actual persons' lives, particularly about someone as fragile and self-destructive as Sylvia Plath, is often extremely difficult. For starters, the viewer often knows the story line. Anyone who knows the name Sylvia Plath is aware that she committed suicide so there are few surprises for the audience. What this movie does so well is make the downward spiraling of Plath interesting without stooping to cheap sentiment or sensationalism. Much of the credit for this film's success must go to Gwyneth Paltrow who is quite mesmerizing as the tragic poet. She literally becomes Sylvia Plath. Conventional wisdom is that Ted Hughes, played here by Daniel Craig, was basically a cad and treated Plath badly. That may in fact be true, but this film portays him as someone who for a long time worked hard to save a relationship that was doomed from the beginning. In her increasing paranoia, Plath accused him of having affairs with almost everyone he met, practically driving him into the arms of other women-- at least according to this film version.

Certainly these two extremely talented poets join the ranks of other famous couples who though passionately in love cannot live together. One of the best films of 2004, SYLVIA is not to be missed.",1119312000,,1265,4.966981132075472
1507735,3,B00005JMJD,"I almost shut this movie off, and wrote it off as a loss. I don't pretend to be a very understanding person when it comes to poetry. However, it seemed to me that Ted and Sylvia Hughes didn't know how to present the communicated word to each other in thier marriage. There were 2 rather good performances in here with Gwynnth Paltrow as Sylvia, and Daniel Cage as Ted. Thrusted together by thier love of poetry, and cut down by the real world of ""Hey you 2 are married; be a team, and not two separate players."" I feel that's what had happened. The marriage seemed rather good in the beginning, and you could see that as inspiration ran on both Ted and Sylvia, but the realization of being a family instead of a couple just didn't sit too well, and Sylvia went on a trip to post partum depression, and Ted went on a trip to drive Sylvia what seemed to be crazy. With Sylvia's depression running rampant he should've been trying to help her, and not going off to tend to business. Sylvia's welfare should've been his business. However, Sylvia's behavior seemed to just falter more and more as she'd suspect Ted cheating on her, and finally he does so with another female poet. The last few moments of this movie focused on the possibility that Ted and Sylvia getting back together, and this is what Sylvia is hoping, but Ted says that the other woman is pregnant, and he can't leave her. This finally pushes Sylvia over the edge, and she commits suicide on Feb. 11, 1963. She was very young, and to me she died way too early. She had more to offer the world, but when depression kicks into high gear the only thing you can think of is death. I know that's how it was with my late wife I did, or so I thought everything I knew how to to keep my wife happy, but in the end it still wasn't enough. She wanted to die, and she died in a hot parking lot on June 11, 2003. This movie was, or so I thought rather slow moving, and at many times not an upbeat movie.

""Ariel"" may be the finest book of poems by a woman EVER, vivid, dark, trilling, grisly, and gorgeous.  That book, her last, is available in a lovely new hardbound with previous drafts and interesting information.

Get that, rather than this film, because the filmmakers were barred from quoting very much of her poetry or excerpting lines from her best novel ""The Bell Jar,"" and without her powers of the written word on display, we don't know why a movie about Sylvia Plath would even be made.

All we have is a dysfunctional woman succumbing to suicidal depression.  Poets' lives are seldom impressive; it's their work we remember!  See ""As Night Falls"" for a much better example of a poet bio-pic; it has a far more interesting plot and is soaked in the man's vibrant poetry.",1113436800,14,942,4.783950617283951
1507901,4,B00005JMJD,"Gwyneth Paltrow is at her most powerful and persuasive in this portrayal of troubled American poet and author Sylvia Plath. The principal actor in this drama -- who appears in every scene -- gives a subtle, textured and three dimensional portrait of the young wife, mother and author of poetry about death, despair and foreboding. Her work parallels her life in the drama.

All the players in this biopic turn in fine work including Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes, the noted poet and Plath's husband who loved his wife and children, yet typically found answers to family conflict at the bottom of a liquor bottle or in another woman's bed. Other players -- including a sympathetic neighbor and Paltrow's real life mother, Blythe Danner, who played her mother in the movie -- turn in equally believable work.

Director Christine Jeffs deserves credit for the uniformly outstanding work by the actors. Each fills a niche in this somewhat naive and transparent look at a famous person's life, and each does fine work in their own right, supporting the best work of Paltrow's career.

This film is less electric and less kaleidoscopic than another depressing life story, ""Hilary and Jackie"", that covers much of the same ground. Still, the film painting of the principal character by Paltrow is credible and absorbing at every turn. Many performances with less guile and technique have won Oscars.

If you enjoy films about famous artists and can look past the shortcomings of describing a lifetime in 100 minutes, you will enjoy this movie. Fans of Paltrow should rush to it if they've not yet experienced it, for she shows another side of her estimable self under Jeffs' direction.",1112659200,3,1675,4.929078014184397
1507902,3,B00005JMJD,"Sylvia Plath was a woman living a relatively normal life as a poet. Her husband, fellow poet Ted Hughes, eventually maintained an affair and left her. Sylvia was devastated and later killed herself. The story is a simple one; in fact, some suggest that had Plath not been famous most would consider it a tale not worth telling on screen at all. Though I agreed in my initial reaction to the film, as I think about it more the film is not simply a feminist accusation against men and how their actions drive women to ""the edge,"" but it is a quiet, minor study of depression and its effects.

With poetic camera work and Gwyneth Paltrow's subtle but shattering turn, Christine Jeffs has much to work with. Though the story rolls along much too slowly and without anything new to add to infidelity in cinema, what she shows us about depression is interesting. Some say Hughes was to blame for Plath's suicide, but isn't it really Plath's depression that would eventually lead her to take such action? I'm not saying that Jeffs intends to shed positive light on Hughes' actions as a husband. What I'm saying is that the depression exhibited in ""Sylvia"" is the self-destructive sort; it throws away rationality and causes one to make impulsive, unwise decisions one would not necessarily make otherwise. Thus, Plath's suicide becomes all the more devastating and relevant. Though the film certainly does not represent all aspects of her suicide, I would like to take note of its correct decision in making depression almost a character in itself, directing Plath in most of what she did in her later life, even inspiring some of what are considered her masterworks.

Depression numbs the mind and soul of human beings. In Plath's piece ""Lady Lazarus,"" her attempted suicides are spoken of with nonchalance, as if she were simply playing some game at a fair over and over till she won a teddy bear for her lover. While these facts revealed themselves throughout the film, all I could think was of the utter malignancy of intense depression; though Jeffs was not successful in pacing, she provokes an appropriate amount of thought.

Though the film is titled 'Sylvia,' it is mainly about the relations between her and Ted Hughes.  Probably you are a kind of movie fan who want to see this 'high-brow' drama, so you don't need any further explanations about them.  I only add that it starts with their Cambridge days, and ends with the fatal day and the gas oven.

Now, the problem is this; 'Sylvia' sidesteps many questions about her complicated life, concentrating too much on the turbulent relations with Ted Hughes.  However, take away the fact that the film is based on the life of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, and what will remain after that?  And where is her 'daddy'?

'Sylvia' or its director Christine Jeffs is not kind to Ted Hughes.  I admit that they can view things this way if they like, but the film seems to attribute most of her incredible anguish to Ted Hughes's womanizing habits (which the film claims), and still dilutes his behaviors.  Sylvia's life thus is portrayed as a painful one, as the housewife playing the second violin or neglected wife who must stay at home, but clearly, these pains, immediate and real as they are, do not explain the personality of Plath.  And that personality is only to be found in her poems.

Good acting from Gwyneth Paltrow as Plath, Daniel Craig as Hughes, Jared Harris, Michael Gambon, and very clever casting of the real-life mother of Paltrow Blyth Danner as Sylvia's mother, good music score (thanks to Gabriel Yared, 'Cold Mountain'), and good period costumes by Sandy Powell ('Shakespeare in Love').

Ted Hughes was played by Daniel Craig, the love interest of Angelina Jolie's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"", but yet again if you compared the two you would see no physical or even spoken similarities. I will give the movie credit however for condensing a massive tale of darkness and passion to 2 hours without making it look like a mess, but I still thought a lot of integral moments were left out. In fact I know there are some deleted scenes floating about somewhere because in the trailer it shows brief clips of Sylvia and Ted playing darts (?), and Sylvia in a rain storm saying, ""Never leave me.""

1507907,3,B00005JMJD,"A film by Christine Jeffs

""Sylvia"" is a film about the life of the American poet Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The film begins with Plath in college and being all upset about the review of her poetry in a magazine (it might have been a university magazine, but that is never made clear).  Soon after she is told about another young poet named Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig).  They meet and fall in lust, and despite the title of the movie being ""Sylvia"" the movie quickly becomes about Sylvia and Ted.  Perhaps this is my greatest problem with ""Sylvia"", that we don't see Sylvia Plath as her own woman.  Instead we see Sylvia Plath only in relation to Ted Hughes.  I do not know too much about the life of Plath, but since her journals were posthumously published, and she is the author of ""The Bell Jar"", ""Ariel"" and won the Pulitzer Prize (also posthumously) for her collected poetry, surely she was a strong enough personality to actually be the subject of a movie which is supposedly about her.  But, perhaps I'm wrong about that.

This is a depressing movie.  Sylvia Plath was fairly depressive in her own life, and ""Sylvia"" gets this right.  She is manic and unstable and emotionally beat down by Ted Hughes.  Her marriage of ups and downs is mostly downs and apparently she is never able to find her focus in writing, though she does manage to publish a couple of books of poetry.  She is still overshadowed by her more successful husband.  At this point, I think ""I"" want to stick my head in an oven.  It feels like Plath gets yanked around from place to place and is her own emotional rollercoaster and gets no emotional support from her husband who ends up cheating on her anyway.

We never really get to see Sylvia writing her poetry, or speaking her poetry, or using any of her intellectual talents other than in one early scene which sets up the lust between Plath and Hughes.  The reason for this is probably because Sylvia Plath's daughter would not permit the filmmakers to use any of her mother's poetry, which meant that only whatever could be legally used outside of that permission was used.  This left us with only a couple of brief lines of poetry from a very famous poet.  This unquestionably harms the movie because we have no sense in why Plath is famous and remembered.  All we have is what we see and hear in the movie and that is a depressed poet who doesn't write is having an unhappy life.  Let me see ""that"" movie!

The problem is not the casting.  Gwyneth Paltrow does an excellent job in portraying Sylvia Plath and she even looks remarkably like the pictures I have seen of Sylvia Plath.  Daniel Craig does a fine job of Ted Hughes, though I have no sense of comparison.  The problem is that this is a very dreary movie and it gives us no reason to care for these characters, especially the heroine.  ""Sylvia"" is dull, it is boring.  This was a good role for Gwyneth Paltrow to play, but she would have been better served in a different movie about Sylvia Plath.  Grade: C-

It would be the perfect study for a poet, writer, mother, one-time-depressed-person-who-doesn't-kill-herself like me.

I also knew Gwyneth Paltrow was in it so it must have merit from that alone.

I read several of the reviews here and was prepared for anything - not liking it, loving it, not caring about it.

I found myself pulled into the imagery from the beginning - ironically, to the aliveness which seemed to inform Sylvia's creativity... like the energy of the wind pushing their leaves into dancing or the movement of the row boat upon the ocean when she was ""unable to write"".

One of the reviewers spoke of this piece being presented from the viewpoint of Plath's husband, poet Ted Hughes, played in this film by Daniel Craig..  I felt it was balanced - and truthful - it didn't sugar-coat either ""side"", it instead simply unfolded the story that bound these two (and those around them) forever.

Some of my favorite images from the film were Ted leaving, once again, and the focus being strongly on the couple and then seeing their daughter, alone, playing quietly outside as her Daddy leaves them.  It is like the child is a shadowy afterthought, perhaps like Plath saw herself following her Father's death when she was only 9 years old.

Another image is Plath preparing to write (typewriter in place, paper and pencils at attention, everything ""perfect"") and nothing coming from her mind or heart onto the page.

I also appreciated seeing Plath's intuitive side picking up on her husband's ultimate marriage breaking affair during a seemingly innocent incident, which was followed by an incredible line (and I wonder if it came from any of Plath's writing?"") ""The truth comes to me. The truth loves me.""

I also appreciated the subtlety of Plath's ever-present mental illness. Throughout the movie there were times when she would simply repeat, ""I am tired. I am sooooo tired.""

She wears the same skirt in many of the scenes, day after month after year.

I also tuned into the quietness of Plath's depression - the wordlessness of it - the inability to speak it or write it into the air.  She finally speaks it to a friend, saying ""I'm hollow.""

Yes, there is much to consider, to study, to revel in from this movie.  The facial expressions from Paltrow and Craig are enough to fill several pages.

Somehow the director, who is a woman, never chooses to give us passion or even any amount of interest in the topic at hand, the matter of fact presentation is dull and the climax is expected. So she killed herself and, well, the director rolls the credits and nothing is ever satisfied inside the viewer's mind......",1102982400,,453,4.746835443037975
1507910,3,B00005JMJD,"I caught this movie on HBO a few nights ago.  I had heard about it, and wanted to see it.  I knew Gwyneth Paltrow and her real-life mother, Blythe Danner, were playing Sylvia Plath and her mother.  I expected the movie to be a downer, since it is a true story, and Sylvia Plath committed suicide in February 1963, during an especially bitterly cold winter, even by England standards - and I was not wrong.  This movie left me feeling down, very down.

This movie seems to take for granted that everyone knows HOW Sylvia Plath committed suicide.  They show everything that I have read about her last hours on earth, except how she killed herself.  She really did take bread and milk, and put it by her children's beds.  She did close their door and seal it with tape and put a towel at the bottom, so as to protect them from the gas of the oven.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has, or is, suffering from depression, or going through an especially dark, stressful period in their life.  I thought it was informative, very low-key and very depressing.",1102032000,4,1065,4.443298969072165
1508086,2,B00005JMJD,"I was just about equally looking forward to and dreading the release of ""Sylvia"".  Finally catching up with it on DVD, I give it high technical kudos(photographed extremely well, sound is superb).  As far as biography goes, however...

I should say that I have been interested in Sylvia Plath since college.  While not the stereotypical angst-ridden college girl, my Plath-loving roommate was...But her interest finally inspired me to read the famous poems that this most famous suicide wrote.  Surprise!  They were *great*.  Plath's poems deserved all the notoriety they'd gotten.  And yes, when a body of work that's so famously dark(mostly)is the product of a woman who very famously killed herself, you DO want to learn more about the personal life of the poet.  And once you begin to delve into one or two Plath biographies-oh, my.  What a fascinating, infuriating, brilliant, troubled woman she was.  Truly, this was a life story that begs for a decent film treatment.  Sadly, after an opening credit sequence that perfectly captures the strange, haunting effect of Plath's poetry, the ""story"" of the film-that is, the screenplay-is pretty darn lame: a by-the-numbers romance of a troubled girl and her troubling husband.  And crimes of crimes-it's done *boringly*.  So much is glossed over-or wildly over-emphasized.  Real-life, documented events that were exciting are for some strange reason restaged to make them less so.  And there's zero chemistry between the ""passionate"" couple.  Daniel Craig is totally miscast as the man so handsomely LARGE that Plath's friend Anne Sexton called him ""Ted Huge"": he looks puny and unattractive.  Paltrow is trying much, much too hard to ""be"" Sylvia Plath; she should have just relaxed a bit(no matter how uptight the real woman was), been less ""careful"" with her every gesture. Better yet-they should have cast someone who looked less ""like"" Sylvia and embodied her better-Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Cate Blanchett, any number of great actresses could have helped.  But the fatal flaw is the lousy screenplay. In sum: Plath afficionados will be disappointed; others will be totally bored.",1101859200,9,2132,5.254437869822485
1508087,3,B00005JMJD,"***1/2 What is it about an artist dying young - particularly if it is at his or her own hands - that strikes such a deep chord in so many of us?  Is it the fact that this rare and special person achieves a kind of mastery of fate at the last moment, a perfect conclusion to this messy business of life that we mere mortals can never hope to attain?  Could it be that this early death is just one more instance of an artist taking the elements of raw reality and transforming them into something stylized, transcendent and meaningful for the rest of us to brood over and contemplate?  When poet and novelist Sylvia Plath committed suicide in 1963, she became the archetype of the tortured artist - particularly for sensitive young people who came to romanticize her end and her suffering in ways that lifted her and her work to iconic status.  The biopic, entitled simply ""Sylvia,"" gets the ""tortured"" part pretty much right, but has considerably less success with the ""artist.""

The film focuses mainly on the tumultuous relationship between Plath and her husband of eight years, famed poet Ted Hughes.  The story begins in 1956 with their love-at-first-sight meeting when they were both students at Cambridge University.  The film moves quickly through the years, showing how, after a short period of relative marital bliss, Ted's philandering began to take its toll on the relationship.  As portrayed in the movie, Sylvia, despite her notable talent, is a mass of neuroses and insecurities, always toiling in the shadows of her (initially at least) much more well known and commercially successful husband.  But her feelings of inadequacy and jealousy over Ted's infidelities cannot, in and of themselves, entirely account for her paranoia, her outbursts of anger and her suicidal tendencies.  Those resulted mainly from the clinical depression that tormented the woman from the time of her father's death early in her childhood to her own tragic end.  The movie sidesteps the electroshock therapy Plath underwent at various times in her life (though it very subtly hints at them), yet the film still manages to convey just how great a victim she was of this disease she could not overcome.

Thanks to John Brownlow`s rather singlemindedly depressing screenplay, there's a tremendous feeling of sadness hovering over the film.  Director Christine Jeffs brings a raw intensity to many of the confrontation scenes involving the pain-wracked, benighted couple.  As Sylvia and Ted, Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig give rich, moving and sensitive performances, and Michael Gambon leaves his mark as a sympathetic neighbor who tries but does not succeed at saving Sylvia.

If there is a flaw in ""Sylvia,"" it is one common to films that attempt to portray the lives of artists, particularly writers.  Although a scenarist can dramatize the details of an artist`s life, it is virtually impossible for him to capture the richness and power of the art itself in the different medium of film.  We never get the sense of how Sylvia either overcomes the difficulties of her life to succeed in her writing or how she uses those difficulties to enhance her art.  What we do get is a few shots of Sylvia sitting in front of a typewriter, a comment or two about a book that has been or is soon to be published, a few references to critical reviews, and a smattering of voiceover recitations of Plath's poetry.  What we don't get and what it is virtually impossible for film to capture is the essence of the writing itself.  For this, one needs to return to the source material, the works that have lived on after the woman herself all these years.  If the movie inspires new people to explore Sylvia Plath's writing, it will not have been in vain.",1101081600,4,3733,4.838050314465409
1508088,2,B00005JMJD,"I'll admit right now that I only sat through a half an hour of this movie. I'm confident in that it was enough for me to write an accurate review.

One serious problem with the movie is that everything was happening so quickly, even though nothing was really happening. Sylvia and Ted meet, share some contrived moment, kiss and have sex within the first ten minutes or so of the movie. Then there's some vague mention of a transcript and suddenly they're in America, and married, no less.

At that rate, it was impossible to empathize with either character without having already known about the history and writing of the two characters.

Additionally, Sylvia's discourses on her attempted suicides come off as little more than bids for attention. The stories may have been essential to the plot, but it should have been done differently.

All that aside, Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the role, naturally The actor that played Ted was less convincing, considering that he would not choose an accent. He switched between two or three in  various scenes, which was amusing, but disconcerting.",1100390400,4,1094,4.891891891891892
1508089,3,B00005JMJD,"Making a movie about Sylvia Plath is an incredible opportunity to tell a story about a woman who was quite talented and interesting,yes? So why did the film makers not rise to the occasion? Instead they decided to make a movie that gives a breif, ""sweeping"" glimpse into the relationship of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes.  The title is a little misleading, and should of been something like ""Sylvia & Ted"" Or ""Watch Sylvia push Ted into an affair because of her own mentally unstable inner life"" I was disapointed afterall because the movie is called ""Sylvia"" and having Gwyneth Paltrow deliver such a powerful ,beautiful and brutal performance should of been  enough to inspire these people to jump at the chance they had in front of them..to make  this film a great big story of her life.  Which is what most of her fans, (and from reading most of the reviews out here) people were expecting.  But it wasn't and so all I can say is that if you are interested in watching or buying this movie do not go in with too much expectation.  Instead your going to get a story about a mentally ill woman who loves poetry, who falls in love, who creates havoc on her marriage, and who finally takes her own life.  It is artistically done and beautifully shot and sometimes takes your breath away, but is about all good I can say.

  Now, the actor who plays Ted Hughes (im too lazy to find his name) is pretty interesting in that he DOES play Ted well, but for some reason there is not a whole lot of chemistry between Gwyneth and this man.  I think, if your going to focus a film around 2 people in a relationshp then the audience has to be  invested in both the people equally, but this film has a tendency to look over Ted as the person he was truly, and instead focuses on what he meant as a piece of Sylvia's life.

 Because we don't really see the romance bloom, (as if the film makers expected the viewer to understand and know the backstory of Ted and Sylvia)  we don't feel as much passion and love for the two of them together as we should-- which is quite a mis-step considering this film is centered around this relationship.  Well...having all this said, it is a good movie to watch on a sunday afternoon when you are feeling a bit blue and looking to be elevated onto a different sense of life; because it is artistic and poetically shot and is a tragic tale to get lost in.  It is not a waste of time or money; it is just not as great as it could of been.",1097452800,,2459,4.299349240780911
1508090,4,B00005JMJD,"In portraying an interior life as complex and as troubled as Sylvia Plath's, the visual medium of film faces enormous obstacles, but this biopic does its best to overcome them.  Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Plath, as she shows the poet's emotional transformation from just before her marriage, when she was hopeful, to the desolation leading to her suicide.  The movie focuses almost exclusively on the relationship between Plath and poet Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig), and in this, does an admirable job of showing how Plath could not escape the shadow of her husband's fame despite her own ambitions.  His infidelity and her incessant jealousy destroy their marriage while leading to some of Plath's best poetry, the volume titled Ariel that posthumously vaulted Plath to the status she had craved her entire adult life.

The acting is generally excellent, with Blythe Danner and Michael Gambon turning in skilled supporting performances. Unfortunately, this biopic lacks balance.  In its relentless push toward Plath's suicide, it forgets that Plath's life was not only about her death.  Her relationship with her children is only faintly hinted at and then usually bleakly; one scene shows her contemplating suicide at the edge of the ocean while the somber face of her daughter, peering out of the car window, pulls her back.  But where is Plath's motherly dedication prior to that?  And while the screenplay portrays Plath's temporary passion for her work after Hughes leaves her, the film leaves little sense of her poetic nature.

""Sylvia"" is a good, but not great, film.  Those who know a lot about Plath may be bothered by the omissions, but this is a moving, often compelling, introduction to Plath the woman.  High school teachers might want to show this to their students only after discussing the details of her life in class.",1096243200,10,1839,5.056291390728477
1508091,5,B00005JMJD,"By now everyone knows that SYLVIA didn't set the box office on fire, but I imagine that most people who are addicted to the Plath Hughes saga managed to sneak in to the theater, perhaps covering their faces in shame the way they used to do in porn theaters.  Try to keep away the fans who have devoured every biography of Plath and every memoir by everyone who knew her even tangentially.  The DVD is pretty shoddy, there are no features where there could have been plenty!  But that might be because apparently the tyrannical Plath Estate refused to let the producers use any of Plath's poetry and denied them cooperation in every other way as well, and young Frieda attacked the film without having seen any of it, but she seems to be rather a touchy person but who could blame her?  Anyhow the film is as flat as an old souffle, Gwyneth looks a lot like Sylvia, Blythe Danner is simply horrible playing Aurelia, and the house she shows off to Ted makes her seem like a millionairess with black servants in a vast mansion, which in no way reflects the true economic status of Aurelia and Otto, you just watch the engagement party sequence with your jaw hanging open, the movie never really recovers from this terrible faux pas.  But outside of that, it's pretty good.  Michael Gambon is in it, reminding us of why ""Gambon"" is the French word for HAM.

The two young actors who play David and Assia Wevill are also perfectly cast.  They might actually be the real life couple whose intrusion into the lives of Ted and Sylvia lit the fuse that exploded their sham of a marriage.  The makers of the film invest the enterprise with a wistful hopefulness, you can tell they really wanted to do a great job, and for the most part, we embrace their hopefulness with a wan sigh.",1092873600,3,1772,4.478260869565218
1508092,2,B00005JMJD,"When Frieda Hughes wrote a poem in protest of this film, she called it ""Sylvia Suicide Doll."" It turns out that she wasn't that far off. This is a mediocre movie in many respects, and a decent one in others. Overall, it is a misfire.

Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow) was an American poet who found her soul mate in British poet Ted Hughes, played here by Daniel Craig. Sylvia was obsessed with her poetry, and was a little resentful when her husband's star eclipsed hers. Their passionate marriage deteriorates when Hughes cheats on Sylvia and she discovers it, moving with her two children to London. Worn down by depression, Sylvia Plath killed herself in 1963, at the age of thirty, but not before writing the brilliant ""Ariel"" poems, which secured her place in the canon of American poets.

Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Sylvia Plath is the reason to see this movie. She is especially effective in the second part of the film, when Sylvia separates from Ted Hughes and plunges into a deep depression. In these scenes Paltrow looks and acts so much like the real Plath that you get goose bumps. The resemblence is eerie. Paltrow creates a woman desperate for love and recognition, but who dealt with intense suicidal urges all her life. Many people have decided to cast Sylvia Plath as a saint, with Hughes as the devil who drove her to suicide. Paltrow makes it clear that Sylvia's death wish was there from the beginning, and dares to make Plath unlikeable at times. You can understand why Ted Hughes left her, but also sympathize with her as she falls apart. The scene where Sylvia burns the letters that Ted's mistress wrote him makes your heart break. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a very strong, brave performance. It's a tragedy that nearly everything surrounding it is inferior.

The supporting cast, with the exception of Michael Gambon and Blythe Danner, is forgettable. Daniel Craig is hopeless as Ted Hughes, he is simply not a very good actor. The first choices for the part of Ted were Russell Crowe and Colin Firth, who both refused, no doubt because the script for ""Sylvia"" is weak. It fails to give you a sense of who Plath was as a writer, and is full of holes. In one scene, Sylvia says that she can't write anymore. In the very next, she is celebrating the publication of ""The Colossus,"" her first book. The cinematography for this movie is breathtakingly beautiful, one of the best of the year.

The one thing that I cannot forgive this movie for is its ending. It perpetuates the myth that Sylvia Plath is a martyr to suicide, that it is somehow noble that she abandones her two young children and her career. In the film, as Sylvia looks into the oven, a heavenly golden light shines upon her. There is no excuse for this ending. Sylvia Plath's suicide was a tragic loss to her family and to literature, not a noble act.

See this movie for the cinematography and for Gwyneth Paltrow's great performance. One day there will be a great movie made about the life of Sylvia Plath. This one manages to be little more than the CliffsNotes version.",1092009600,28,3062,4.662962962962963
1508093,4,B00005JMJD,"I saw the film in theater yesterday. Let me point out first that 'Sylvia' is quite similar to the movies, like 'The Hours', 'Frida', in that it depicts the artistic career of a woman with love problems. For this reason, you can either get engaged with the movie easily, or you might stop watching it, because you've seen similar scenes before. But the Paltrow effect will probably cause you to choose the first option.

To give some bit of introduction as far as what happens in the movie: Syliva Plath is a young poetess, who's been submitting her poems to magazines to receive a review. She finally gets one. But it's a degrading review, written quite harshly. At the magazine's gathering in the evening, Sylvia finds the man who reviewed her, and enchants him with her beauty. This man is Ted Hughes, who also writes poems, good ones. They marry each other. And this marriage is what the whole film focuses on, which is for you to see.

The cinematography is dealt in a perfect fashion, I'm still amazed at how well they revive the old years in the movies. Details such as Louis Armstrong playing on the small radio in the kitchen, Sylvia's mother telling Sylvia of the fold at the bottom of her dress, german words which are squeezed into conversations such as 'Ubermensch' or 'Bienenkonig' make up very enjoyable moments throughout the movie. Perhaps you shouldn't miss this film.",1092009600,3,1385,4.7190082644628095
1508094,3,B00005JMJD,"While Gwyneth Paltrow does turn in an accomplished performance as Sylvia Plath, ""Sylvia"" is a mediocre viewing experience and gives us little to chew on before the inevitable conclusion. The film takes a predictable path in detailing Plath's and Ted Hughes' turbulent romance. There is little mention of Plath's poetry, with the exception of Paltrow reading a few lines here and there. The Bell Jar is mentioned only once. As another reviewer commented, her motives and influences for writing are not made a focal point of the movie and in fact are hardly touched upon at all.

Sylvia Plath was an enormously talented poet who soared to great heights in her early years. Her bouts with depression are well chronicled and to portray her life in a balanced way is difficult at best. Director Christine Jeffs (Rain) knows just when to bring in the subtle (mostly dark) humor and when to dive into the seriousness of Sylvia's disease. Paltrow does an amazing job balancing both sides of Plath's personality, and the film can be exhausting. Thank God for a great cast, wonderful cinematography and well crafted editing.

1508240,2,B00005JMJD,"I have a theory, one which largely influences this review.  I have found that true stories which make you say, ""That would make a great movie"" are the hardest to make a good movie of, and they often end up looking a lot like cliche television movies-of-the-week. This is probably due to the fact that the director and writer are locked into playing out the story elements.  The problem is compounded when the true story is a biography:  we inevitably get each of the most famous moments of the person's life dramatized in order.
On the other hand, true stories which seem too simple to make good movies of, often become brilliant movies because there's so much room for the director to add subtety and humor.  Thus, two simple true stories produced the two best movies I've seen this year:  ""In America"" and ""Moonlight Mile.""
""Sylvia"" is a perfect example of the former.  Reading through a book biography of Plath, or the lengthy Vanity Fair article biography, one can't help thinking, ""This would be a great movie!  I can just see this brash American girl in her scarlet dress nail handsome poet Hughes at a party.  I can just see him jumping up at a pub and reciting brilliant poetry.  I can just see her manic episodes come to life as these two great personalities clash.  And oh her famous ending dramatized!""  But if you know her story at all, the movie lacks any creativity, and seems to just to dramatize each favorite moment scene by scene.  Do the actors or script provide some intimate interpretation of the story, one which makes us wonder?  Not really.  Paltrow is a beautiful and talented actress, but her casting was far too safe for the role, and she plays it by the book, while not capturing enough of Plath's Americaness.  It would have been interesting to see Scarlett Johannsen in that role --a woman I think looks more like Plath, and one who might fit the dresses and the settings of the era in a typically American way (i.e. less thin and pseudo-British than Paltrow).  It was hard for me to get past Paltrow as ""an actress playing Plath,"" especially when the script and direction provided no added subtlety to the story.  The director only seems interested in making the sets and locations truthful:  a common pitfall of directing biographies of famous people.
If you know Plath's story, I think you'll be disappointed by the film.  If you don't know her story, I think the movie may be a treat, despite its faults.",1086825600,6,2438,4.627906976744186

As one who knows a tremendous amount about Plath, I was expecting pure poetry, but instead I got, a pathetic woman crying, screaming and dying throughout the movie.
Plath was so much more, her poetry was so much more.
She deserved something exquisite...
Because she was exquisite.

I found myself checking my watch only 30 minutes into it. The other bad thing about this is that the DVD itself sucks. With no extra features, I don't see the point. They could have at least had some commentary or making of stuff, or even a Plath doc on it- but there is nothing at all. I hated ""The Hours""- I thought that was even worse than this, but at least the DVD is better and has more features on Woolf and the writer, etc. I ended up getting ""The Hours"" on DVD even though I hated the film because of the features (I only paid like 6 dollars of course).

1508244,2,B00005JMJD,"SYLVIA, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the poet Sylvia Plath, is another example of how hard it is to make a biographical film about a creative person. The movie focuses on the marriage of Plath and Ted Hughes (played diffidently by Daniel Craig), who was at least at the time the more famous poet.
  It's really impossible to capture on film what made Plath and Hughes talented writers. They gaze into the distance, have an inspiration, write it down. At least in the movie POLLOCK we got to see the result of all the brow furrowing. There's a lot more attention paid to Plath's mental illness, but only on a superficial level. Plath is unhappy almost constantly, but because of the lack of context, it seems like all her problems are caused because Hughes isn't nice to her. I suspect it was a good deal more complicated than that.  In turn, Hughes is (apparently) driven to infidelity by Plath's behavior.
  I should say Paltrow is excellent here, fierce and tough. It's a reminder of what she can do given a good role. But the movie is determined to make Plath a martyr, but to what? No extras on the DVD, either.

1508245,3,B00005JMJD,"Director Christine Jeffs manages to strike an evenhanded tone in her biopic ""Sylvia,"" which deals with the last few years in the life of poet Sylvia Plath. Jeffs doesn't place all the blame for Ms. Plath's suffering, deep depression and subsequent suicide on Ted Hughes, (which many Plath fans do), nor does she glorify the poet's pain. However, the complexities of Plath's psyche, illness, motivations and goals, the intricacies of her relationship and marriage to Hughes, and her roles as mother and poet, are short shrifted. I don't know if this flaw is due to the limitations of the medium or to problems with the screenwriting and direction. This is a film about a woman with a suicidal past who writes poetry, loves, marries, becomes depressed, insecure and jealous, has children, is ""deceived,"" falls deeper into depression and turns on the gas - the main character just happens to be Sylvia Plath. I really would have liked to have seen more of an emphasis given to Plath's writing and love of literature. Ms. Plath also placed tremendous importance on parenting her children and often found much pleasure in being a mother and a wife, as well as a poet. This is not evident in the movie.
Sylvia Plath's story is a desperate and tragic one. However, the movie dwells on her depression to the extent that it appears the writer never had a happy moment after her honeymoon. Even the film's use of color reflects this unhappy mood. Plath dresses in warm colors up until her wedding, after which her clothes and the ambient colors become darker and darker. Her writer's block is clearly shown but her periods of extreme productivity, especially toward the end of her life, when, writing through the nights she poured poetry onto the page with almost manic energy, are not really portrayed. All the biographies I have read on Sylvia Plath discuss the joy she found in motherhood. Her exhaustion caring for two small children, taking care of her home and writing is evident throughout the movie, as it was in real life. But nowhere is Ms. Plath shown laughing and playing with her children, with the exception of a brief Christmas scene. Her small daughter is almost always shown toddling behind her mother, a bewildered, sad expression on her face. Nor does the movie show Ms. Plath's tremendous struggle to live, fighting against her overwhelming depression. The contrasts between happiness and deep sorrow, energy and listlessness, struggle for control over her demons and loss of control are strangely absent. The character of Sylvia Plath ultimately comes across as a relatively passive figure, at the mercy of her mental illness, whose moods are closely tied to her husband's demonstrations of affection and attention.
Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job, as always, given the material she had to work with. Her performance is sensitive and intense. The few times she recites poetry, including a wonderful scene where she does a small bit from Chaucer's ""Wife of Bath"" in Middle English, are extraordinary. Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes is excellent, capturing the magnetic charisma of the poet, his bewilderment as his relationship falls apart, and his careless indifference toward Sylvia's suffering and his children's vulnerability. Blythe Danner, Paltrow's mother in real life, is excellent in the role of Plath's mother and Michael Gambon does an extraordinary job as the sympathetic downstairs neighbor.
I have been a big fan of Sylvia Plath's poetry for many years and have read some excellent biographies on the poet as well as work by Ted Hughes. This is a difficult review for me to write because I want to be objective about the film, which does oversimplify Ms. Plath's life. We get the facts but not the depth. There is a tremendous lack of scope here. If one is not familiar with Plath and her work I am not sure that the movie would inform with more than a melodramatic overview of her life. As stated above, the acting is fine and the photography appropriately moody. For a more comprehensive experience I would suggest reading some of Ms. Plath's exceptional poetry, if you haven't already, before viewing the film.

1508246,1,B00005JMJD,"I thought this film was dreadful. Thank goodness Plath's daughter had the sense and premonition to refuse to let the producers use the poet's work in this trite film. What was the point? To see Plath put her head in the oven? To re-play tiresome cliches (the sexual symbolism in this film is sophomoric)over and over? Paltrow is an actress of little depth who clearly has no insight into Plath's character or intelligence and can only play her like a wounded ingenue-how disappointing. Hearing her ""read"" two lines of Sylvia Plath's poetry made me want to laugh out loud. Really, avoid this and read any of the biographies available or, better yet, Sylvia's letters, poetry or diaries. I'm amazed to see the good reviews for this film on Amazon-it's one of the worst I've seen recently and really does a dis-service to Sylvia Plath's talent and complex, if troubled, personality.",1078704000,12,879,4.866666666666666
1508247,2,B00005JMJD,"I have been waiting to see this movie since I first heard it was in production. As someone who writes herself, I have long admired the mesmerizing, exposed, raw depth that is Sylvia's talent. Sylvia's poems (and life), move the on looker deep inside of her core in such a way that no other can do. This was not captured in the movie. This movie was a surface display that skims the honesty and history of Sylvia. It's as if the director was provided a ""summary"" of Sylvia's life (and only part of her life, her life with Ted) and stretched that summary out for an hour and fifty minutes. The movie was slow and this could have been avoided if more of her life was explored. To see the essence of Sylvia, you need to see her earlier years (her childhood, her father and mother, her hospital stay, her internship, The Bell Jar) and delve inside of her mind and her need to purge through her writings. There was also an evolution in the development of Sylvia's poems, in her real life, that the movie completely by passed. Her poems initially were written with the aide of a thesaurus and tended to be classic and calculated, while the final poems, written before her death came pouring out in shorter, smashing truth. Her best poems written at her deepest point. There is a creative story to be told her then, as well. Her poems growth, tell multiple stories in themselves. I learned nothing new, and in fact mostly noticed what was missing. The movie was emotional, but too direct as to why (there was more to the why). Any movie that has such an ending, would touch the viewer. However, it was actually my prior knowledge of Sylvias demise that moved me through the movie, not the movie itself. Those who view this movie without that prior knowledge are not experiencing her story in the fullness. I hope one day a movie is made about Sylvia the at least _tries_ to capture the many faceted dimensions of her whole life and the haunting vulnerability of her work.",1077840000,18,1963,4.50140056022409
7940271,5,B00005JMJD,"This is a wonderful film, brilliantly acted and beautifully produced. Obviously, if you don't have any idea who Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes were you might find it a bit of a downer - but most people will know what to expect. It's extremely moving, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig - back when he was doing some serious acting, are perfect. We need to feel the heat between these two complex people, and the film totally nails that aspect of their relationship. Watch the film then read their poems. I loved it.",1525996800,,514,4.537634408602151

7940274,2,B00005JMJD,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. It portrayed Sylvia Plath to be a jealous bitch and portrayed Ted to be the most talented one, when in my humble opinion, she was every bit as talented in her own right. She was also well educated and well traveled which should have been brought out more. I only give it three stars. As for my experience with the seller, it was great!",1500422400,,375,4.295774647887324
7940275,4,B00005JMJD,"The largest and most overplayed criticism of this film is that Sylvia Plath's daughter did not like it. Notably, she never saw it, said this before the movie came out, made some off-color cynical comments about the movie fetishizing her mother's life for those who lacked the imagination to picture an anguished woman sticking her head in the oven.

I absolutely don't blame her for saying so. If someone made a movie about my parent or family member, I would likely hate them and reject the whole ridiculous idea. The film itself, however, sensitively portrays both the life and the death of the author, and Gweneth, whatever you might think of her silly side project Goop or her  uncoupling, is here an eerily brilliant actress giving one of her best performances.

The plot of the film makes it an often uncomfortable viewing, but it has many rewarding moments of inspiration as well. They incorporate SOME of her best poetry (hard to do in a film) and evokes some very difficult relationships in the life of a talented as well as troubled author. Her moodiness is often painfully tangible. At times she acts with childlike vulnerability, at other times like a soul too old for her own good.

Ultimately, if the film were excessively 'comfortable,' it would probably be dishonest or Hollywoodesque. On the other hand, perhaps her life was far more fun than we give it credit for. Hopefully I'll return to improve this review later, but that's all I've got for now.",1476316800,8,1467,4.786561264822135

7940277,5,B00005JMJD,"As I am not an aficionado of Plath or Hughes, I would like to rate this as a dramatic film about mental illness.  It has a great deal to say about creativity, too, the unknowable process when something original is born.  With these themes, this is an excellent and moving film, a testament to the difficulties of modern life.

Plath arrives in Britain, an ingenue with the highest ideals about art.  She is ambitious and beautiful, a brilliant Smithie on a Fulbright.  She meets Ted Hughes and the connection is absolutely and immediately electric.  He is a lothario type, one of those narcissistic men who cannot help but prey on willing women and even after they are married, he continues to do so.  The effect on the naive Sylvia is terrible, aggravating her tendency to depression and suicidal tendencies that she slowly reveals to him.  Eventually, her mental illness consumes their marriage and then her, which is the great tragedy we know in popular culture.  But before she dies, her genius bursts forth, in a masterful synthesis of her discipline to that point and the great mystery of talent.

The acting is absolutely flawless.  Paltrow is a fragile and luminescent beauty, completely believable and brimming with intelligence, potential, and darkness.  Surely, an entire literature was lost with her suicide.  It is really quite stunning.  Craig is wonderful as Hughes, a protean and cultivated talent who pursues his vision with absolute concentration.  Their entangling chemistry is perfectly recorded.

The great virtue of the film is that it judges no one.  She suffered from a mental illness that perhaps no one could have healed.  He was who he was, and he certainly loved her for a time, but it was too much for him in the end.  The weight of it would hurt him for the rest of his life.

Recommended warmly.  This is a great portrayal of a time and place, with remarkable individuals and a doomed relationship.",1456963200,2,1929,4.837920489296636
7940278,1,B00005JMJD,I've read quite a bit about and by Sylvia Plath and this movie left A LOT to be desired.  I watched it last night then told my husband it was the worst movie I've ever seen.  If I didn't know anything about Sylvia I would be very confused by this movie; knowing about her I'm still confused.  What was the movie trying to portray exactly? Awful.,1456185600,,345,4.196969696969697
7940279,2,B00005JMJD,"This film wasn't good.

Gwyneth Paltrow was magnificent, neurotic, brittle, and brilliant, and though her character was full, it wasn't a complete film, because she was left without her charismatic equal.

I love Daniel Craig, especially as James Bond, but he was all wrong for this film.  Craig was never able to convey Ted Hughes magnetism, sexiness, height, charisma, and strength.  Sylvia Plath was a storm, but he was her equal, and it was never shown  the pull they had on each other  and others - how much Hughes cared for Sylvia Plath, how captivated he was by her mercurial swings, and even, how much he loved her, adored her, admired her, and protected her.  The film seemed to nullify Plath, forget that she had power too.

It was Sylvia Plath, who taught Ted Hughes to be professional.  It was Plath, who introduced Ted Hughes to the physical pleasures of life.  It was Ted Hughes, who followed Plath, and not the way around.  He was completely in thrall with her.

I didn't like this film.  Plath might have committed suicide, but the film made it seem her poetry was the product of loneliness, desperation, and sadness, and not from sheer brilliance.  Because Plath was always writing.  She wrote from the beginning.  Thats all she wanted to do.  She just couldn't find time for it.  And she was at her best, when Hughes was not with her.

Assia Wevill is not fully developed, and the juxtaposition would have made for a great film.  Even more dynamic than the etiolate Hilary and Jackie, where you compare the exploitative needy cipher Hilary with the arousing, beautiful, and talented Jacqueline de Pre.  Its a great film  as fiction, and Hilary still comes off ugly, small, and bitter.

Gwyneth Paltrow is a wonderful actress, and I just wish the film had done justice to both her ability and Plaths skill.  Both were lost.  Both were playing at dead ends.",1451779200,,1873,4.70679012345679
7940280,1,B00005JMJD,"I don't think they portrayed her or her lifestyle well at all and it was just bad. I also found it especially disrespectful to her family, since Plath's daughter, Frieda Hughes, did not want her mothers life made into a movie so people could be entertained by her life story rather than all of her writings! If you really want to know about Sylvia read her poetry books, The Bell Jar, and The Unabridged Journals of sylvia Plath, and all the other wonderful stuff she had wrote!",1448582400,,478,4.505747126436781
