8733262,5,B015DIBZWA,This concert set is awesome. It comes with a dvd of the concert which is about 2 hours. Lots of great songs. one can't help but really get into it during the watching experience. It also comes with a documentary dvd. Which is pretty cool. It also has a booklet filled with various pictures of the band before and during performance. actually there are a lot of pictures in this book. It arrived a week before it was due through the mail and it was well packaged for the journey from Japan. Overall excellent.,1474416000,,508,4.414893617021277
