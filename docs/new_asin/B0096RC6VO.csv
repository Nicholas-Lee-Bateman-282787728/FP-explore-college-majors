5274299,5,B0096RC6VO,"This is just a review on why this show is so awesome, when this dvd comes out I will place a more appropriate review on the actual episodes of this particular dvd. : )

So while we wait, here is some background for those of you who are curious as to why this show is so popular around the internet and globe.

I'll start my review with a little background about me and how I realized the awesomeness that is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM).

First a little bit about me, I am a college student studying electrical engineering at SDSU and cute shows like MLP:FiM help me unwind especially since course work is getting harder. I am senior for pony sake! I am an avid anime fan that loves in particular very ""moe"" ,extremely cute, anime. It is an acquired taste : ) Some examples of shows I like would be Mahoraba ~ Heartful Days ~, Ore No Imouto ga Konnani kawaii wake ga nai, Working!!, Ruby Gloom, Pokemon, Azumanga Diaoh, and Yuru Yuri. I also like plenty of cartoons shows back from the 90s such as, Dexters Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd and Eddy, the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Hey Arnold, etc... All shows are awesome in their own right, but I have to say that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic steals the top spot in my list now. I can't believe it, but it so rightly deserves to be so. It takes everything about anime I like, it takes everything I like about cartoons and disney I like, melds them together perfectly. Ask yourself is that even possible? For that achievement alone this show should receive major props, I thought it would never be possible.

I first realized My Little Pony Friendship is Magic during one of my study sessions at college. I was finished with homework and I decided that I deserved a break so I did what I usually did I looked up some information on the latest Anime coming out from Japan. I'm a big anime fan all the way back since Pokemon. Anyways, as I was surfing around on the internet on my favorite website animeph.com which by the way is the best place to go if you like cute animation like MLP:FiM. I get all my ""moe"" anime fix there. If you like the adorable eyes of the ponies and you like anime that website would be heaven for you as well. On one of the forums, I noticed some people chatting about  My Little Pony, as I continued to read their chats it intrigue me. Are they talking about the little girl's show back from the 90s? Why would teens let alone boys like it? Isn't too girly? So I decided to investigate myself and I looked around for the first episode and from there I was hooked, and the cuteness meter in my head blew up! So 52 episodes later, I became a bonafide fan. I couldn't get enough of it, and I'm anxiously waiting for the third season.

Why is My Little Pony Friendship is Magic so awesome? Well all have their own reason to like the show, but for me I think what won me over was the ""90s-esque"" cartoon dialogue in combination with the cute art style. That is the combination that practically gave me an awesomeness overdose. It is no surprise to me why this show has a older audience following for one it is reminiscent of the cartoons in the 90's were dialogue and jokes were smart and witty unlike today's cartoon's were most jokes are dumb and/or just plain weird. One other main aspect that sets this cartoon apart is the awesome voice actresses that really give all the characters depth, voice alone! It is a treat just to hear them talk, it blew my mind and it can only be witnessed when you watch the show. To top it off, since MLP:FiM is an all family show it is compatible with any age group! Great dialogue, characters, awesome musical shorts, and an educational value puts MLP:FiM above all the rest of this generation cartoons. MLP:FiM is simply a treat to watch.

 So do yourself a favor preorder this dvd. Everypony is doing it! : D",1346976000,38,3843,4.372549019607843

Guess what, Amazon had the movies. I was so excited. My grandaughter was so happy to receive her movies.

Contains ""cutie mark crusaders chronicles, swarm of the century & sonic rainboom."" It also includes ep 1 of ""family game night"" which I didn't care for...even though it takes up half the dvds running time.

For those of you curious, there's no subtitles option or a play all option. Interestingly before each episode, it'll play a HUB commercial.

Season 1 has been out for quite some time but like I said, this is a rare dvd & only bought for collector reasons.",1381795200,2,629,4.452173913043478

and I love it!

I live in Australia so shipping costs are relatively high but this only was around $17 for the price of the product plus shipping so that's good
The episodes Included are all episodes I love
It came in limited edition casing which is not available in AUS along with this disk at all
only complaint is that i thought that it would play on my Laptop when i changed my region code to 1 instead of four and it still didn't play so that's not very good but still
goes along with my season one box set

The mane six plus Cadence and Shining Armo(u)r have to save an entire empire against an evil foe but aren't sure how to do it until Twilight Sparkle unearths a book detailing the history of the Crystal Empire and how it protected itself.

Not knowing the names of the episodes I didn't realize the episodes were from season one and two; only two of the episodes are from the 'new' season.  Pretty disappointing. I'm sure if you have read the reviews you realize this, but there weren't reviews before I purchased it.  You should buy the seasons instead in my opinion.",1357257600,5,433,4.2439024390243905

Great series with many episodes with Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and all the other friends. Friendship is Magic series offers stories with lessons that help even the youngest little girl. Colorful and full of songs it is delightful. I am glad Amazon has pre- order so you can get the newest DVDs right when they come out and also they are cheaper than in the store.

That being said, the episodes included are:

The Crystal Empire, Part 1
The Crystal Empire, Part 2
Sonic Rainboom
Luna Eclipsed
It's About Time

These are some of my favorite episodes so for me this a great little set, and the dvd is very fairly priced to boot. There isn't a whole lot else to say, if you like the show, buy this and support future releases!

EDIT: When I wrote this review, the price of the dvd was $6.99. Currently, the dvd has seemingly doubled in price. This might change your opinion on whether it is worth the money or not.",1354233600,28,641,4.361344537815126
5274359,3,B0096RC6VO,"I'm giving this 3 stars simply for the content of the purchase.  I would absolutely NOT buy a dvd with only 2 episodes on it for any price.

If you want to support Hasbro (or rather, the crew that develop the show), then I would recommend buying the season 1 boxset when it comes out in December.  If sales are good, they will continue to release box sets for the future seasons and you can buy the full season 3 when it comes out.

As for the actual quality of the 2 episodes on this disk: they were awesome.  One of my favorite premieres or finales so far.

Review update:  After looking at some of the statistics of the contents I noticed it never actually mentions the number of episodes (though, I could have sworn I saw it said 2 somewhere), but it does mention a 120 minute run time.

Not really sure if this is actually 4 episodes, or an hour of extra commentary, but even still I would stick to my original claim.

15$ for 2~4 episodes is not as good as ~35$ for the entire season; even if season 3 will be shorter than the others.",1352851200,5,1040,4.185929648241206
