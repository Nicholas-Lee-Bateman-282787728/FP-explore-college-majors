8296243,3,B001CUB40M,"The MODERN MARVELS episode entitled PLANE CRASHES will not satisfy anyone looking to see fiery remains, injured survivors or jets flying into the World Trade Center. That is not a criticism, as I can live without such depressing spectacles. ""Plane Crashes"" could very well be carefully crafted propaganda from the FAA or various tourism boards.

Throughout the  hour show, we're given constant reminders that statistically, jet travel is incredibly safe.
Examples:
If a man flew a commercial jet every day it would take 21,000 years before he was in a fatal crash.
There are more traffic fatalities in a month than in the past 40 years of commercial flights.

We are also shown pilots training on simulators with all sorts of bells and gizmos, a blatant message of ""these guys, these advanced planes, will save you every time!""

The jet that exploded over the Long Island Sound some years ago is theorized to be a victim of gas fumes in an empty fuel tank. Now, we are told, tanks in planes that aren't carrying a maximum load of fuel (for the sake of lightening the load) have inert gas pumped into those tanks. Problem solved, tada.

Since 9/11, cockpit doors have been so heavily reinforced, no hijacker will ever be able to breach one, short of having a blowtorch in his pocket. Tada again.

So that's the gist of the program: a problem is presented, then concrete solution given.

Except for the generic label of ""human error,"" one situation never specifically mentioned occurred in Washington, D.C. in January of 1982, when a commercial fight hit a bridge, then splashed into the near-frozen Potomac River. Four motorists on the bridge were killed as were 20 of the plane's 24 occupants. Ice on the wings was the culprit, pilots neglecting to engage the jet's anti-ice system the cause. (They actually tried to use the jet exhaust of a plane in front of them to solve their icing condition!)

OK, so this viewer ""gets"" it: air travel is SAFE SAFE SAFE, but I don't CARE CARE CARE. For me the scariest part of getting from Point A to B by jet is the descent. You KNOW that plane is falling, and it's only up to the pilot, computer systems, the control tower and the ALMIGHTY as to whether or not the thing will touch down safely.

After all, THIS flight could be that 21,000 years stat mentioned earlier.
I'll toss the dice and do a road trip instead.

So watching a supposedly reassuring ""Plane Crashes"" only makes me think of such movies as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AIRPORT/dp/B00AFEYS9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AIRPORT</a>&nbsp;(suicidal briefcase bomber),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALIVE/dp/B000065V40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALIVE</a>&nbsp;(cannibalism on an Andes mountain) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DIE-HARD-2/dp/B000O77SRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DIE HARD 2</a>&nbsp;(control tower takeover).",1447286400,,2966,5.571111111111111
8296244,3,B001CUB40M,"First, this is not a typical documentary with a series of plane crash videos.
Rather this explores the scientific reasons for crashes that have occurred.
It is an informative look at why planes have gone down, but is rather short in content.
The DVD quality and appearance is not up to History TV's usual standard either.
In short, knock $10 off the retail price and everything would be value for your dollar.",1312070400,3,409,4.694444444444445
