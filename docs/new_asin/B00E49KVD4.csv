8600928,5,B00E49KVD4,"Insightful and heart warming. Producer and director, Andrew Muscato, has given us a gem of a documentary, not just about baseball, but morals, faith, and the true meaning of life. ""The Shot Heard 'Round the World"" has been chronicled in many ways but this film brings the story to another level, touching your soul. See this movie today.",1380844800,4,337,4.827586206896552
8600929,4,B00E49KVD4,"My fellow Amazon ""Top 60 Reviewer"", K Harris, has already posted a lengthy review about the film so I will not repeat much of what he wrote but, rather, embellish on it, hoping to provide additional info.

As K says the film, on the surface, appears to be only for baseball fans - particularly those over 55 or 60 who may remember the famous 1951 game. (Me? I was 7 at the time and a Philles fan.) . But it is more than that. Early on it becomes almost as equally a documentary on ""ghost writer"" David Ritz who has ""co-authored over 100 autobiographies. As you will see, he normally completes a book in 60 days. I've reviewed ""Ritz"" books in the past but had never seen or heard him till now. With two heavily tattooed arms and various piercings - along with a shaved head - he could easily fit in with a heavy metal band. And I actually found Ritz's story more interesting than Branca's.

There is a third major character in the film: Wall Street Journal reporter Joshua Prager. Prager is not mentioned on the package or - surprisingly - in the press release, but he is included in interviews in the film. Without Prager, there would be no reason for the film, except to promote the Branca/Ritz book. It was Prager who, in 2008, broke the story of the ""stolen signs"" (you'll understand when you see the film) in an article and in a follow-up book.  Prager supported his research and Branca write it off. Ritz, as K Harris points out, didn't care about facts. He just wanted to move on to his next co-write.

I don't think that K pointed out that the film is in BLACK & WHITE to blend in with the old newsreel  footage used. This didn't bother me much and actually shows Branca's features more (he was 85 at time of filming).  Direct Andrew Muscato - whose previous film ""Ballplayer: Pelotero""  impressed me (see my Amazon review) uses some strange filming techniques which broke up the parts that were becoming boring for me (repetitive stories), but his use of mostly gospel music as a soundtrack often distracted me from the story.  For that reason alone, I deducted one star.

The DVD has no special features. Just a series of four ""trailers"" for other Strand Releasing DVDs.

Yes, I can recommend this to anyone interested classic baseball with a partial recommendation to those interested in how celebrities have their bio co-written). Well worth a watching.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
