7112101,3,B00VUK505O,"As with a number of films in this genre, the hyper-creative cinematography during the title sequence in Lazarus is actually better than the rest of the movie. Yes, this flick blends sci-fi and horror, but will likely not satisfy fans of either; I can't speak for horror enthusiasts, but Lazarus departs way too far into the absurd for this sci-fi fan. When Lazarus comes close to being amazing (and it does at times), it falters by making pigs fly.

PROs
 The first half of Lazarus is an adept setup that opens up the door to endless possibilities.
 The actors were well cast and are more or less convincing in their roles (before the movie kicks into its parlour trick mode).
 Dream imagery reminds one of The Shining, Dreamscape, and 100+ other good movies produced 1980-present.
 As someone who has spent time in labs like those portrayed here, it is humorous to see embellished representations on screen. This is a plus because if you watch Lazarus as a comedy, it's not a bad movie.

CONs
 Like too many films, The Lazarus Effect's creative juices are depleted somewhere after the halfway point. It just becomes a strobe-light omnipotent undead slaughter in the labyrinth flick. To be fair, a more ambitious plot taking the audience to new and dramatic places (figuratively, and probably literally) would have cost several times this movie's estimated $3M budget.
 The ""10% of the brain myth"" mentioned in the film remains just that: a myth.

7112102,2,B00VUK505O,"THE LAZARUS EFFECT is a horror/thriller that squanders an intriguing premise on cheap scares and shoddy plotting. It seems sometimes to be missing some connective tissue in the dialogue or editing that would give the story more flow, which makes it feel a lot longer than its lean 82-minute run time would suggest. My guess is this thing was chopped to shreds in post-production. Whatever the cuts were supposed to improve, I'd say it didn't work.

The story is nothing new. A group of scientists have developed a serum that can revive a dead brain. Any seasoned horror movie fan knows that when a film is about bringing creatures back from the dead, inevitably something supernatural is brought back with them. This movie is notable, at least, for blurring the lines between science and spirituality. When our leading lady is brought back from the dead, she's not the same, but it's unclear whether the change is chemical or demonic. In fact, for an intriguing moment, the movie seems poised to argue that there's a way it can be both, but then it devolves into dumb, predictable slasher-y territory.

This might have worked better had the rest of the film been a bit more interesting, but this nifty twist on an old trope is surrounded by a lot of cliched window dressing, including a canned ""You're playing God"" speech as well as a shadowy corporation that suddenly threatens to take the research for no good reason. There's also a lot of stuff that is stupid or nonsensical, such as scientists taking home a test animal that they just revived from the dead and living with it like it's their normal pet dog. At one point, the elevators stop working and the characters announce that they are trapped in the building, even though there is clearly a sign next to the elevators that tells people to use the stairs in an emergency.

At least we have a decent cast that tries hard (for the most part). Olivia Wilde does her best as our revived leading lady (a plot point that is revealed in every trailer but which still takes nearly half of the movie to happen), and Ray Wise is a nice treat in a brief cameo. Unfortunately, our leading man, Mark Duplass is a cold fish for the bulk of the film. Duplass has never met a scene he couldn't underact, and although that serves him well in his mumblecore romantic dramas and quirky indie flicks, it's a huge detriment in a film where he's supposed to act terrified for his life or devastated by the death of a loved one. He could've been wearing a plastic mask of his face over his real face and his performance would be 99% the same.

It sets out with a cool idea, but this movie quickly dies, and no amount of demonic black eyes and spilled blood is able to bring it back to life.",1432512000,18,2726,4.534552845528455
7112103,5,B00VUK505O,"Nicely put together story that is a unique mix of science fiction, supernatural horror drama and mystery. A group of scientists are conducting experiments with a serum bringing patients back from the dead and start off with a dog Rocky he has severe cataracts on both eyes after he is revived their are changes among other things he's no longer blind. Zoe one of the scientists is accidentally electrocuted her fiance desperate to save her brings her back with the same procedure with horrific results.

Like the dog Zoe is successfully brought back and changed but in a far worse and more deadly way, it seems it not only revives the dead but also reaches into other places not only the dark side of the human mind but also into the spiritual realm evil. The other scientists learn this the hard way as Zoe's new abilities slowly manifest then strange frightening and inexplicable things begin to take place. I really enjoyed this science fiction/horror, the supernatural, horror, and science fiction being 3 of my favorite categories and this film being made of all three drew me and I am so glad I gave it a chance. The ending is oh my God I did not expect that what a great plot twist and grand finale",1432080000,6,1205,4.604651162790698
7112104,3,B00VUK505O,"This isn't a lab experiment. This is a person. Youre talking about bringing a person back from the dead. Zoe (Wilde) and Frank (Duplass) are scientists working on a secret experiment that has a surprising effect. When they bring a dog back to life they are told to stop all testing. They don't listen and when an accident leaves Zoe dead Frank only has one thing in mind. But when Zoe comes back things are different. This is a movie that has a really neat idea and started off really interesting and I was into it. Little be little the movie started to drag and get repetitive. The end got a little cheesy and generic. All this said though it wasn't that bad and is worth watching, but do not expect anything too amazing and scary. Overall, an OK movie that really lost steam the longer it went on. This is worth seeing, but really not more than once. I give this a B-.",1431648000,3,870,4.310975609756097
7112105,3,B00VUK505O,"The Lazarus Effect is an oddity of a movie in that it is not what most people are going to anticipate when they pay to see it. The movie, to me, was not a traditional horror film at all, but rather an almost political stance on near death experiences and the people that undergo them. Do not misunderstand me; this isn't a Michael Moore film here, it just seems to have almost religious themed undertones to it. The movie also doesnt really ever leave the viewer afraid in any way. I don't even know if I jumped throughout the whole thing, but it does have some potential for some jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Overall this movie is nothing essential to the genre, but at least its interesting to say the least.

The movies plot is one that originally fascinated me quite a lot. Something about a vulnerable group of medical students that are trying to change the world just seems to draw me in every time. These guys have basically discovered a serum that brings the dead back to life, and when one of their party unsuspectedly dies, they decided to use the serum.untested on humans till now. It doesnt take a genius to figure out that things are going to go awry, and Of course, they drop out of control rapidly. Ill let you watch it to find out the intimate details, but Im sure you have a pretty good idea what happens, and how the movie ends.

The movie isn't anywhere near essential to the horror genre, and should only be viewed for something to kill time for a couple hours. You definitely won't be kept up at night worrying about Olivia Wilde under your bed (or maybe you will). Give it a shot, who knows, you may like it.",1429401600,36,1632,4.4366666666666665
7112106,2,B00VUK505O,"Theres a distinct difference in a thriller and a horror movie, one that moviegoers don't seem to be picking up on as of late. Thrillers - at least in my eyes - are films with an exciting plot, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole experience. And on the other hand, horror films are exactly as described: horrifying. They get under your skin and aren't easily forgotten (the best example would be The Shining). And The Lazarus Effect, despite the way its being marketed, is not a horror film. It may provide cheap scares that cause the audience to jump in that very moment, but it isn't genuinely terrifying. Real horror movies cause sleepless nights and can frighten you to the core. This film most certainly does not. That, above all, is the main reason why this movie got on my nerves.

The plot alone could make for a potentially interesting film: a group of medical students essentially trying to bring the dead back to life with a new serum theyve created. However, it takes a ridiculous turn when one of the researchers is killed in an accident and the team is forced to test the serum on a human for the first time. Of course, things get out of control quickly and the rest of the movie is set up. Im sure most of you can guess what happens.

Ill admit, I tried to look past some of the problems I had with the film during the first half and enjoy the chaos, but it swiftly became worse and worse. Olivia Wilde - an actress I usually enjoy - descended into an utterly laughable performance as the film progressed and the rest of the cast isn't much different. At times, I felt as if I was watching some lost 70s movie that shouldnt have ever been found. Just keep in mind - if you do decide to see this sad excuse for entertainment - that it is not and should not be considered horror.",1428624000,13,1820,4.334310850439882
7112107,2,B00VUK505O,"Zoe (Olivia Wilde) and Frank (Mark Duplass) have discovered a serum that speeds up nerve fiber regrowth. They have a grant and experiment on their dog Rocky which has demonstrated odd responses in his brain scan. About halfway into the film Zoe dies and is revived using the drug, something the trailer doesn't hide. Again odd things happen.

The film is designed to take a different look at NDEs (Near Death Experience) from that of science. The real action (the stuff you see in the trailers) comes in the last 20 minutes of the film which was short (83 minutes) to begin with. I spent most of the last 20 minutes wishing someone could locate the light switch.

I was rather bored with the ending and explanation asking myself ""Is this a faith based film?""

1.

I bet that guy had fun explaining himself to their shareholders. This could've been changed to any other version of executive meddling and it would've worked way better.

2. Instead of thinking about the story, I'm thinking ""There is no DMT flood - that's stupid."" First, how does that help an already dying body survive or reproduce, and therefore, contribute that process to the gene pool? Second, in order to trip your brain cells need oxygen - the lack of which is precisely what leads to death.

We don't need to know any of that, though, so why did the characters turn what could've been a suspense building mystery into a distracting goof?

7112119,3,B00VUK505O,"Lazarus, of course, is the man who according to the New Testament was brought back to life. This horror film is called The Lazarus effect because it explores the effect of being brought back to life from someplace about which we have no knowledge and what effect being brought back will have on the previously dead person and people around this person.
The film is about experimenters who want to try to find a way to revive the dead. One of the experimenters is Zoe. She is a religious Catholic. She has recurring dreams based on creating a fire in an apartment building that caused the death of many people. She is convinced that the horrors she sees nightly foretell the horrors she will experience in Hell when she dies.
The experimenters succeed in bringing a dead dog back to life. Then an accident occurs and Zoe is electrocuted. The other scientists decide to bring her back to life as they did with the dog.

7112122,2,B00VUK505O,"Summary: Two skulls - Story progresses quickly in the first 25 minutes; if you don't pick up on the not-so-subtle hints here, don't bother on rewinding because the movie skips it too. Do what you can to ignore the pseudo-science and underhanded nerd references. In fact just toss out everything you may actually know about the workings on human anatomy and emergency aid and fall face first into the idea that resurrection is one Big Pharma college grant away. There's honestly more mystery in who'd be interested enough in the lab's progress to hack the security cameras and watch the events unfold from a safe distance.

Story: Typical. If you're a suspense horror fan you know all of the tropes before they even show on screen. Fangores you'll be sorely disappointed, I mean REALLY disappointed for a resurrection film...Modern horror? Well, your jump scares are a-plenty and poorly timed as always. While the beginning moves quickly to establish backstory the movie seems to have some really bad attention problems before progressing through the sequences afterwards. Characters suddenly have a sixth sense to establish trust issues before any real reason of suspicion is displayed on screen. Somehow our ""monster"" is submissive and quiet long enough for the rest of the crew to immediately assume bodily harm is around the corner because ""her brain is completely lit up"" on an MRI. As soon as that's established; backflash for reasons, power outage, moment to establish ""no escape,"" death of supporting cast ensues, false happy ending, jump scare, credits. It really does feel like it moves that fast and drops the ball on tension that could be built in a small set. I've seen good tension established in one room sets; four walls, no windows, one door. All opportunity was lost on this story. As a horror-freak and self-proclaimed nerd I find myself asking ""Why"" more than necessary when it comes to this film.

Lead Character: Olivia Wilde does 'okay' as our lead/monster Zoe, but doesn't break out of the box in her performance. Dry, wide-eyed ""I'm innocent, but not really and kinda religious"" Zoe is about as basic as she could be before getting offensive. Once ""monster"" status is established we don't see much of a change in character emotion, voice or posture. I would have loved to have heard a natural voice that's been trained over a very mild autotune. As far as her makeup transformation, there was nothing. She maintains the pretty face and nice hair the WHOLE time. Really not much of a monster even when on fire; all that really changed were a pair of blackout contacts and minimal watercolor black around the eyes.

Supporting Cast: Mark Duplass (Frank), Sarah Bolger (Eva), Evan Peters (Clay), Donald Glover (Niko) and Cato (Rocky) play as our fillers in this small set. Again, none of them do particularly memorable performances that fall into the tropes we horror fans have come to be accustomed with. Come to think of it; they die in the typical order too... One's a jerk, one's a nerd in love from afar, one's pretty and kinda dumb, one's pretty and kinda smert and then there's the token moderate/love interest. Oh, and one's a dog.

Gore: Snooze. Minimal gore, blood or even perceived harm. Evan Peters had probably the most screen time as far as a death sequence goes - he did well in that. Sean Bean should keep an eye on him. The 'damage' to set was minimal as well. For two months of filming they could have gotten more creative. After the events of the movie the interns could clean up this lab in a matter of hours and nobody would know what happened.

Atmosphere: Minimal claustrophobia with the ""small"" but somehow overly spacious set. I mean swing your arms as wide as you can and try to hit something spacious. Lighting, angles, color palate is all bleh. There's no sense of ""over sterilization"" with harsh lighting to go with the laboratory setting, no bleak color changes as the mood alters, no interesting perspective changes at all. Not even a musical score that gives the viewer goosebumps.",1489190400,,4034,4.840579710144928

What is a cool, albeit unoriginal, concept, is pigeonholed by its rating, hindering it from truly exploring its theme and the terror that should accompany it.

The script, though rudimentary in places, is sound and engaging, but the performances are so predictable and stale, that the storytelling instantaneously suffers and thrills immediately diminish.  There are a rare few quick and effective shocks, but the majority of the scares are redundant and commonplace.

Here is the synopisis: A group of researchers led by Frank and Zoe have achieved the unimaginable- bringing the dead back to life. After a successful, yet unsanctioned, trial on a deceased animal, the team is ready to unveil their breakthrough. When the dean of their university learns of their experiments, their project is shut down. The team recreates the experiment, but things go wrong and Zoe is horrifically killed. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank attempts to resurrect their first human subject. The procedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong with Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team is no longer faced with the question of whether they can bring someone back to life- but rather, the wrath of her return.

I highly recommend this movie because it is SCARY! I love the spookiness of the story and direction. I love Zoe's character, and who can forget the super adorable Evan Peters!",1460937600,2,1248,4.777777777777778

Seemed appropriate.) Anyways, for buying a cheap, used DVD to draw all over and glue googly eyes to, the sender was great and prompt at getting it to me. DVD was decent quality with a lot of rental stickers on it, but aesthetics didn't matter to me.

In short, great seller if you want some awesome DVDs and don't mind how the box looks, but please don't buy this stupid movie, get a better title from this guy.",1457827200,,627,4.181818181818182
7112161,5,B00VUK505O,"This movie is superb. I was tired of all those current horror movies being filled with blood and gore. I wanted to see a horror flick, but I didn't want to see people get murdered! I want it heavily implied, but what am I, some kind of sicko? I don't want to see it. This movie featured the perfect amount of deaths without being too graphic about it. Between choking on an e-cigarette and being crushed in a locker, I was really happy I didn't have to see any blood. Well, I guess there was some blood that poured out of the locker, but I just pretended that was raspberry syrup. Also, my other problem with most horror movies is that the bad guys are too well-defined! In movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween, the killer's intentions are too obvious! I don't want to know why the caged murderer kills, I just want to not see them do it. So in that sense, I loved how completely unclear and confusing Olivia Wilde's motivations were in this movie. You could never tell if she had gone crazy or was just plain evil or... What. And they never really resolve those questions, which is exactly what I like. I like am many things unanswered as possible when the credits roll. Also, I like when Olivia is the fireman at the end (oops, spoilers.) 10/10 would watch again.

I found the acting to be solid all around. I thought Olivia Wilde was fantastic as Zoe. I liked how the movie was mostly set in a lab. It gives a great feel that the characters have nowhere to run. Long story short, the storyline is solid, not without flaws(character development was drawn out a little too long) , but still good. Probably my biggest complaint is this movie took too long to get going. But, once, it gets going, it's a very good movie. I personally found myself fearful for the characters fate. That, to me, is a good movie. If you have some time to kill, I'd recommend checking this movie out. You might enjoy it like I did.

7112183,5,B00VUK505O,"Initially I wanted to give the film 4.5 stars...but that is impossible on Amazon review-system.  The minus half-a-star was for the lack of music that would properly highlight the atmosphere in the film and hence make it even better...but on the second thought the film-makers were right to incorporate less music and concentrate on the atmosphere itself via heavy breathing and facial expressions produced by fright of the characters.  Also, the surrounding darkness and flashlight at moments add extra thrill of fear and impending death.  I really enjoyed viewing this thriller/horror for two reasons.  First of, it is a horror (SPOILER ALERT) with no happy ending.  A horror that this anti-Hollywood established norms of ending a horror film.  Lately, horror films with no happy ending have gained a notoriety and popular following.  Lastly, when watching Lazarus Effect (2015) for the first time one does not know where it will take you, it is a very unpredictable film.  Additional plus, for great acting and of course Mark Duplass is always great to see in any movie.  The Duplass brothers add so much freshness to American cinema that has been saturated with jews
and their mentality over the past 20th century.  Any project done by him and his brother are always welcomed by me with an open smile.
On the final note, I hope to see a second part to the Lazarus Effect (something along the lines the Lazarus Project: Continuum).  Does of you who don't know who St. Lazarus was...look it up.  Christians or people familiar with Christian faith should be familiar with the biblical story of Lazarus.  In conclusion, I would also like to praise the background story of the key female character played very-well by Olivia Wild, which is was her nightmare from childhood.  That was a very interesting statement that I heard somewhere before, where in the film her character stated ""hell is one's most terrible moment in life relived over and over again..like in the loop."".",1451433600,2,1973,4.957446808510638

This movie is about bringing someone (and a dog) back from death and the creepy things that follow.

It is well acted, with a decent script/storyline, which makes it a bit better than most in this category. It is also well filmed with special effects that are not overdone nor underdone. Well, in this genre, there is no baseline but the lead actress bordered on over doing it.

7112235,1,B00VUK505O,"I deliberated on this for some time.  It started out with a weird concept, but it quickly devolved into sludge.

A group of scientists have created a chemical that they hope will extend life by providing brain stimulation.  Originally, it was to stimulate the brains of coma patients, but bringing people back from the dead and calling the movie Lazarus Effect was just so much cooler.  Let's think about movies that had mind altering drugs where the patients got out of control... the newest Planet of the Apes movies, Firestarter (it even had the cool telekinetic powers), and the Lawnmower Man (telekinetic powers and turns psycho).  Let's face it, the Lawnmower Man was such a better movie.

So they have a successful trial bringing back a dog.  During this, you will watch them pulling up and down on a knife switch to what appears to be a 480 volt electrical box as a scientist yells, ""bring it up to 9.5 kVolts.  For you kids, that is 9500 volts.  I hope they have a really, really good transformer to step up the voltage and bring the amperage to nothing, or those brains will be ON FIRE.  At this point, the movie has a delusional Dr. Frankenstein feel to it, and you know the dog is going to go Cujo.  It doesn't happen, but they can tell the dog is not normal.  Of course, one of them has to die... so they can use it on a person.  Then we are left with telekinesis, killing, and images of hell.

This was an amalgamation of other, far better films, such as Flatliners and Frankenstein. Same cautionary tale that science should never tread on that is god's exclusive domain. (Yawn).  Within a few moments, it was obvious that someone on the team was going to die and that the experimental serum would be used with disastrous consequences. As other reviewers have pointed out, the film did have potential at the very beginning, although, as I've said, this theme has been beaten to death by far better writers. It all started to come apart before Zoe's life took the irreversible turn. But it completely fell apart at the point where everyone begins screaming.

Since I want to avoid spoilers, I can't get into all of the other predictable plot twists other than to say that Zoe's big ""mistake"" was far too obvious. C'mon screen writers, give our imaginations SOMETHING to work with! Throw us a bone or two and connect the dots when it's necessary!

7112297,1,B00VUK505O,"For a film ostensibly about chemistry it's beyond ironic that there's so little of it in evidence within this stillborn horror throwaway. The Lazarus Effect is not atrocious movie-making, it's just too close for comfort. If your idea of watching B-Movie Queen Olivia Wilde and Indie darling Mark Duplass showcase their mail-order acting chops as they battle amoral corporate takeover artists in a race to reanimate the dead then this is your film. From all indications, their preferred emotional state is a deep laconic brooding punctuated by the occasional ""what does it all mean"" fist pump at the sky. Gallons of flop sweat and menacing (though knowing) glances propel this one-set, ultra low budget clunker to it's obvious conclusion. There's lots of Millennial angst and weird dream sequences but never enough solid acting and direction to keep you from guessing the outcome ten minutes in.

At one point the cast tries to go deep and meditate on the metaphysics of life after death but soon decides that vaping on electronic cigarettes and a Sushi run are more to their liking - what more needs to be said.  A lightweight 83 minutes that will leave no lasting impression.",1442188800,,1176,4.964467005076142

7112302,3,B00VUK505O,"If I had to pick a quick and easy way to describe The Lazarus Effect it would be Frankenstein meets Pet Sematarybut just not as good.  A university research team consisting of doctors Frank Walton (Duplass) and Zoe McConnell (Wilde), along with technicians Niko (Glover), Clay (Peters) and developed a serum, code-named Lazarus.  It was intended to assist coma patients regain consciousness but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. They hire a videographer, Ava, to record their experiments.

The team runs a test on a recently deceased dog and successfully brings it back to life.  However, it soon becomes clear that the dog isn't behaving normally.  An MRI on the dog shows that the Lazarus serum hasn't dissipated in the dogs brain and instead is creating new synapses.  The Dean of the University discovers their experiments and shuts them down and a large pharmaceutical company comes in and confiscates all of their data.

They sneak into the lab to duplicate the experience but things go very wrong as Zoe is electrocuted.  Against the protests of the rest of the team, Frank uses the last of the serum on her to restore her to life.  At first she appears normal as did the dog.  But Zoe is far from normal.  She claims that when she died she went to her own personal version of hell.  Even worse, she seems to have brought back a piece of hell with her as well as developing an array of terrifying psychic powers.  The rest of the team finds themselves trapped in the lab with whatever Zoe has become and she doesnt intend to let them leave alive.

While The Lazarus Effect has an attractive and likable cast, they are burdened with an unoriginal and often silly story.  The plot points of bringing first the pet and then the human back to life are straight out of Pet Sematary but with a Doctor Frankenstein-style slant with all manner of electric gizmos and machines zapping and sparking.

I still cant call foul on the film up until this point as my curiosity was still piqued.  But once Zoe is brought back to life the film crumbles into a confusing mess.  What exactly Zoe has become is never fully explained.  Is she possessed?  Is she in reality still trapped in hell?  Did the chemicals she was given cause the change in her personality?  Your guess is as good as mine.

At a mere 83 minutes the film feels padded as Zoes powers are so incredibly potent there should have been no way for the group to survive even a few minutes.  It also made little sense in their returning to the lab in the first place to try and revive another dog.  Their data had been taken.  They were not going to have access to their equipment, and they still HAD the first dog they brought back to life so what was the point?  Having the University halt the project and sell off the contents was a weak contrivance to further the action.

The film gets a minor uptick due to the fact that the always wonderful and quirky Ray Wise makes an appearance as the head of the pharmaceutical that took over the lab.  Love the cast but hate the story.

A stupid and ridiculous 'horror' story.

I didn't know it was a 'horror' film so perhaps others know where it will be going. It really didn't make much sense. No real answers or explainations. What if she revives someone who was not 'stuck' in Hell (or in a waiting place needing 'help' to go on)? Or what if this is all just hallucinations, and someone else has a 'good' hallucination? Will that person because a powerful angel/super hero? Doubtful as the effects of the drug seem to cause aggression, but then none of this really makes sense. Why didn't she just transport herself OUT of the building? She could have easily gotten out. I wouldn't have minded if they ended it with her/her child self going into the light yada yada.

7112422,1,B00VUK505O,"Even the worst Blumhouse horror movies are savvy enough to hit some level of tolerable watchability despite their low-budget limitations. But this film sets a new low. Featuring a few B-stars, (relatively) large budget and theatrical release, one would assume the end result would be their crowning masterpiece and not the exact opposite. This film is boring, predictable, stupid and not scary. Ultimately its just very lazy. Its as if the filmmakers figured that with this abnormal level of money and talent, they would not need to focus on the heart, logic or story as much as usual.

Things unfold in an odd pace. Characters have unusual actions and thoughts. The scares are minimal, bloodless, and happen off-screen. The film is so misguided, several of the rare jolts are unintentionally hilarious. The film is so strangely and poorly constructed that its like an inexperienced childs last-second simulacrum of what a horror movie is supposed to be. Its a shame that stars Olivia Wilde and Donald Glover are damned to another misfire like this, but maybe theyll finally learn to read a script for once in their life first. Or have someone with a shred of taste read it for them.

The pacing is perfect.  The dialogue is done well, able to convey character while dumping a little scientific or philosophical info.

The mystery of what actually comes back from the dead is kept till the very end--an ending you might not see coming, by the way.  It will keep you thinking.

The evolution of those that come back is interesting too, keeping us guessing if psychic phenomena or demonic entities are involved--or BOTH!

Very disturbing scenes left open to interpretation.  Sort of a psycho-spiritual nightmare.

A horrible event occurs and the main scientist partner dies and they bring her back to life, However she is no longer the same and had a dark and hideous alternative.

My question is why did she come back evil? Before she died she was a smart and loving catholic woman and after her death she seemed to have some sort of demonic entity taking over her body. Why would she kill her friends? I think the movie would have been better with a more in depth story line like, a religious base more hell and demon story or a possession of some sort. Like, she died but a demon came back not her. This movie reminds me of 80's movie Flatliners which had a better story.

I happen to like cheesy horror movies so, I was still OK with this one, but as far as a horror movie with Olivia Wilde, she missed the mark.  I was disappointed.  I thought it would be better because she was in it.  I need to realize that even good actors make bad choices.  I still like her, but I'll be more careful in the future.

7112529,4,B00VUK505O,"The first word that comes to mind when trying to describe The Lazarus Effect would have to be predictable.
There was nothing along the way through the story that I couldn't see coming from close to the beginning, all the way to the final scene before the credits rolled.
This isn't a criticism of the movie. How many movies are really that unpredictable anymore?
The highly telegraphed plot aside, it was a pretty impressive movie just the same. The acting was excellent, especially the chilling performance from Olivia Wilde as the movie hits its stride. Evan Peters was just as good as I have come to expect him to be after his performances on the various seasons of American Horror Story and the handful of movies I've seen him in. Donald Glover was impressive too, especially seeing him in the first role outside of Community that I actually felt separated him from that series.
The effects were well executed and the overall feel of the movie was decent as well.
Really, the only problem I had was the religious undertone to the results of the scientific experiment, but that pops up altogether too frequently in this sort of movie...so that should have been expected.
The final scene really did redeem the shortcomings of the rest of the movie though, as predictable as it was. I honestly hadn't quite believed the filmmakers would go where they went with it, but it felt like the only worthwhile possible outcome to me.",1437091200,,1426,4.730923694779117

The reviews were right about having some religious undertones to this movie, all about where we go when we die and the bright light we see at a near death experience. The movie is worth the watch, however is it worth buying, I don't believe so. I didn't find this movie all that scary, I also didn't jump at the jump scares that occasionally pop up.

The dog growling and snarling was supposed to be scary to, and just to be clear the dog wasn't even close to cujo.

Great acting by all actors involved. Good use of cheap effects. I have seen a lot of cheesy movies, but ...WOW! This movie is reminiscent of something you would see on the Sci-fi channel. The storyline however, is very interesting; a group of scientists experiment with bringing back the dead to life once again, only to open a door way to paranormal activity. The movie has some action, but it also has areas that are dry and predictable. Overall, this move is entertaining, but also delivers a total let down.

7112802,5,B00VUK505O,"A small team of medical students have been experimenting with techniques for resurrecting the recent dead, with the hopes of creating a longer enough window between death and revival that doctors working on, say, an accident victim, would have more time and more chances to ultimately save his or her patient.  Initial attempts with animal subjects show promise, and the team is eventually able to revive a dog who'd been dead for a full day.  The dog exhibits strange behavior, alternating between periods of higher aggression and bouts of prolonged lethargy, but the experiment worked.  It's at this point that word begins filtering through the university staff and sponsors about the revival efforts.  A major pharmaceutical company becomes aware of the situation and buy out the college and sponsors, essentially buying the whole project out from under the researchers.

With a small bit of notes and equipment not confiscated, the team tries to repeat their experiment and record it so as to have proof for the world to see.  Things go terribly wrong and one of the researchers herself is killed.  This leads to the first attempt at using the technique on a human being, and is where The Lazarus Effect becomes unpredictable.  Their dead colleague does indeed come back, but changed.  A number of intriguing factors come into play here, some of them being explored and others left open for either the viewer's imagination or for a possible sequel.  I don't want to go to into some of these, but one of the Really interesting things that happens shortly after the resurrection is this -  ***WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS*** -the researcher who comes back, Zoe (Olivia Wilde), is revived after less than an hour, but from her perspective, she remembers whole years of being dead and 'somewhere'.  ***END OF SEMI-SPOILERS SECTION***  There are a number of other really interesting hooks that get tossed out there either here or later in the movie and, obviously, some of them are quite sinister.  Some of the unexplained angles are among the most best in the film.

Reportedly made for less than four million dollars, The Lazarus Effect looks like it would have cost considerably more.  Every aspect of the film - lighting, cinematography, sound effects, musical score, etc. is very high caliber.

The story was patched together and leaves viewers with no explanation about what has actually happened to the main character.  If you're looking for a mindless flick, you have it here.

7112844,5,B00VUK505O,"Alright folks, I'm finally going to give a very clear 5 stars to this film and explain in more detail why I think it is so than I have in the past. It's important to understand that I come from Hollywood Royalty, IE; from Top Screenwriter, Famous Actors, Famous One of The Most Successful Creators of TV Shows Ever and I mean Ever In History, and so on. Yes, I believe it's important to qualify and here's why. This ridiculous nature of critics without experience in the Film/TV Industry don't understand the things that make up a great film. Sure, they'll say ""If I don't enjoy it, isn't that enough? My direct personal experience matters."" Not in the context of being a film/TV critic. Would anyone be qualified to judge how well a downhill skier does without personally experiencing the sport itself? If one says yes, then why are the commentators always accompanied by a former performer in the Commentary Box? Exactly! So, here's my take on this film who've been INVOLVED with the Hollywood Industry and it's affiliates since I was a child (I'm 48 now.) and have had exceptional success in it. For those that say ""This film's been done before."" ABSOLUTE NONSENSE! No film has been exactly done before, otherwise, just about everyone would never watch another film precisely because as so many of these critics say and know, most film formats have been done before. BUT, MY take on that is to say, as we evolve, so can story writing evolve, so can direction of film evolve, so can acting evolve AND MY STATEMENT IS BASED ON SCIENTIFIC FACT, NOT SIMPLY ONLY OPINION!!! This film could be compared to The Original Frankenstein... Really? Come on! It uses content that wasn't even known in it's day and displays it AWESOMELY with many more jump out of my seat moments the original Frankenstein film didn't do once for me. The way fil is directed these days is to make people jump out of their seats once in a while with fear, startlement, surprise, etc... as much as many other forms of the horror genre use. That was not the case many years ago. The story itself didn't rely on these tactics, rather the whole content of the film was meant to be taken in as a whole to scare people and, OF COURSE, I'm writing about the Horror Film Genre... That should be obvious since I'm lending my critic of this a horror film, this one and no other film than this. This film had the thrill of a great roller coaster ride, the thoughtfulness of the designers who built the roller coaster to really thrill the passengers of that ride, the designers (That means the writer, the director(s), the actors even, yes they do have a pivotal role in helping a film be greater or worse than the intention laid out by the writer and director, the casting director, the post sound final mix and everything leading up to that and on and on... You get my drift.) using the latest technology to give that thrill and the obvious editing that made that thrill run well throughout the course of this thrill ride/film. No, not every part of this film was done before. No not every scene ended exactly the way other scenes in films (Again, horror film genre is what I'm reviewing here.). No the film wasn't ended exactly as every film sort of like it before or EVEN like many that were similar to this film's content before. The term exact is obviously used over and over again in my review for a very pointed reason. STOP SAYING, those that critic films with the poor quality of a critic of shoe making, but has never before made a shoe or been any real part of the show making business, THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AND/OR ALL DONE BEFORE
AND/OR THE FILM FOLLOWED THE ""SAME"" FORMAT AS ONE'S BEFORE THAT YOU'VE SEEN AND THUS THE ENDING WAS PREDICTABLE AND ON AND ON... It IS NOT the exact copy of ANY OTHER FILM and thus DID ALLOW FOR ROOM FOR SUSPENSE AS TO WHAT COULD/WOULD/DID HAPPEN and was NEVER leading me to some sort of incredible ability to predict the every move this film made or the ending... I could have guessed it, but the factual evidence stating that knowing is something is going to happen before it does is not there, EVER!!! aND that's hard cold science backing up the last sentence, not my personal point of view.
IN OTHER WORDS, PLEASE STOP PUTTING FORTH, CRITICS of any of these films REVIEWS, without some or preferably much knowledge of what goes into filmmaking. As my analogies testify, that's absurd.
THIS FILM WAS DONE MASTERFULLY!!! Well done to the director, to the actors, to the writers, and so on... It EVEN HAS THE VERY RARE ABILITY TO MAKE A SEQUEL that I say is rare because, not only is this a gem of a horror movie, but also left the movie unresolved and thus the
sequel I HOPE WILL COME for this movie.
I don't, if anyone has read this carefully, put forth the idea that one's experience of a film doesn't count. Whether someone likes a film or not is a perfectly sound reason for one to not like or like or even love or hate, etc... a film. I'm saying that the constant drabble of garbage in judging whether a film is good or not should stop there and not be given the absurd reasons I've read so many of of why a film is either good, bad, OK, etc... This is not most people's field of expertise. I'm not even and expert, but I DO HAVE plenty experience in film creation and film watching. That is a much better ability to judge whether a film is good, bad or OK, etc... than some drabble from one's own point of view with just being a watcher of films. The armchair quarterback fits neatly as an example of what I'm calling these so called critics of these film genres (And many other film genres as well.) and the reasons given before explain why I use that term to describe MOST of the painfully ridiculous critiques of films I've seen. I might completely agree with their opinion of whether a films is good, bad, OK, etc... But not why!!!
I'm not even going to tell people to watch this film as I've seen people do. I won't say their wrong if they don't like it. I won't say that some of the critique of these films are not good examples of how criticizing a film should be done. I will say that most of the critics of these genres and many others have no idea how to put forth a proper criticism of these films and have explained briefly (That's all I care to do for now.) why.",1434412800,,6295,4.418244406196213

The writers had a wonderful opportunity to change things up and give us something to chew on. There were moments when it looked as though the plot would twist, and I sat on the edge of my seat, hoping. But it continued down that predictable course. What a shame!

Some of these reviews make the kind of points that must make writers, filmmakers, etc., scratch their heads in wonder. For instance, one reviewer cites uneven plotting and lack of connective tissue in certain scenes/themes. I saw a very deftly and tightly woven thriller which, to tremendous effect, is shot almost entirely in a single setting with a small group of performers. You don't pull that off without a tight screenplay. Another reviewer noted, mildly critically, that this seemed somewhat like a ""faith-based"" thriller. I wouldn't call it faith-based so much as exploring of interesting theological issues of forgiveness, responsibility, belief, and medical ethics. It reminded me, in good ways, of M. Night Shyamalan's Devil (which I also recommend). I found this deeply involving, well-paced, and, overall, enthralling.",1433894400,4,904,5.373239436619718

The entity is so grossly overpowered that what little is left is a foregone conclusion.
Pointless and sad but not scary.
The acting, the production values (except for excessive use of darkness) were excellent.
Why.... oh Why..... can't Hollywood spend a few bucks and pay for a descent script.
This one was a turkey and even a first rate group of actors couldn't pull it out of the toilet.
Two stars for a valiant attempt to salvage a drek script.",1433721600,,580,4.676470588235294

8711340,2,B00VUK505O,"A team of university scientists (two researchers (Olivia Wilde and Mark Duplass) and two students (Donald Glover and Evan Peters)) started a grant-funded project to help coma patients live longer so that they can be cured. The experiments have evolved into bringing recently deceased animals back to life. After some marginal success with a pig and a dog, the university administration finds out causing problems. A company buys the grant and tries to take possession of all the research as their own property. Naturally this situation doesn't sit well with the researchers, who want credit and a credible success. They break into the lab to try and revive one more animal. Being a horror film, things don't work out according to plan.

The premise is fairly interesting and the characters acknowledge that deeper issues could and ought to be explored. If the dog died, did it come back from doggie heaven and that's why it's acting so weird? Shouldn't these issues be figured out before more experiments are attempted? What about a human afterlife? What are the consequences of bring people back from death? All these issues are nodded at and then ignored. The movie quickly turns into a monster hunting down the humans one by one. That's executed competently, but after the promise of delving into deeper issues, I found it disappointing.

The movie provides a lot of jump scares, some of which feel cheap. The overall horror starts slow and builds up to a frantic pace. I just wish the ideas kept up with thrills rather than being jettisoned for the thrills. The movie becomes totally and uninterestingly conventional in the last third.

If you hate disappointing or pessimistic endings, stay away. Otherwise, this is a low-end B-movie that can be enjoyable with the right expectations.

Not recommended.",1522886400,,1807,5.013333333333334
