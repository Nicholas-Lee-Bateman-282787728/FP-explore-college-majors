Sean Astin was my 1st movie star crush:)  I now know just about everything there is to know about him...and the movie is great.  I still cry at one particular part(not gonna ruin it for those that haven't  seen the movie, but someone dies, and it's really sad).  ANYWAYS...I highly  recommend this movie to any girl out there who wants to see a movie with  lots of gorgeous guys who's school gets taken over by terrorists.(Sean  Astin also shows his hiney, but don't blink or you'll miss it ;P)",931910400,4,587,4.321100917431193

440195,5,630222540X,"Oh the charm of youth!  These bad boys of the upper class USA in 1991 are jean-clad kids at a private boarding school, The Rejects school.  Well ok it is supposed To be Regis School. Their fathers are very high level government and corporate men.
They rebel
By smoking and drinking and hiding under the big kitchen in an old cellar, even daring to hook up their Radio Shack phone on the school
Phone wires so they can call for phone sex.  Ach these bad boys in their rolled up t-shirt sleeves and tight pants!

Suddenly at lunch the school is taken over by a Columbian druglord's  son and his compadres with machine guns.  He is one bad hombre and mad as hell because his father had been arrested and sentenced by one of the kids' father, a federal judge.  So mr kingpin jr will kill everyone if his demands are not met:  release his father.

These boys turn out to be a more clever and braver bunch that these Spanish-muttering slimy  types reckoned with.  They won't take their impending death and imprisonment lying down!

Through well-planned intelligence gathering put together into a notebook, such as using a yearbook photo of the school building to show where each terroriist is located, and where the escape route underground is... which leads to that kitchen cellar...the boys smuggle the intel binder out to the FBI and marines stationed outside unwilling to negotiate with terrirists.  But ready with full blast military force!!! Including helicopters.

What viewers may enjoy is the sheer audacity of these clever boys and the defeat of the nasty drug pusher Columbians, - a real David and Goliath story.  Especially since Sean Astin, son of Patty Duke, is a short and dorky looking fellow, yet the most agile and determined and wiliest of all!  He reminded me a bit of the young Mickey Rooney.

And there is no girl to get In the end so some would say girls wouldn't care for the film.

I enjoyed seeing the loose clothes and fluffed up hair of the 1980's on these boys.  Also I loved the fact that there were no cellphones or computers. Just plain old !  And notebooks and sketch pads to get information transmitted out ....

I also loved how the school just kept running with meals and play time and bells ringing and so on.  Would lowlifes from Columbia really let their captives be free or thrown them into the auditorium and lock the doors?  Sandwiches if they were lucky!

But never mind mundane reality.  There is enough real violence and death  to make the film engaging.  One boy dies just as he is about to be released, simply because he fights the Columbian man leading him out to the gate and his VIP father.

Enjoy a bit of nostalgia for pre electronics!",1489536000,,2681,4.5873684210526315

440280,4,630222540X,"Quite often, particularly in the 80's and 90's, great movies come along that for some reason or another get lost in the shuffle over time and forgotten. 1991's 'Toy Soldiers' is one of those movies. A tight, suspenseful thriller with a good cast and a great script, it has for some reason or another been forgotten and is one of those movies that, when they occasionally pop up on television, you remark to yourself ""wow...I forgot about that movie - I used to love that movie when I was a kid"".

The plot is simple - A Colombian cartel kingpin has been arrested and has been extradited to the U.S.A. for trial. His son, along with a group of heavily armed mercenaries, infiltrates a private school full of children of very influential Americans, taking them hostage, and using them as bargaining chips to try and secure release for his father. As the movie progresses and the kingpins son begins getting more and more desperate and unhinged, several students plot ways to free themselves before their captors ""liberate"" them permanently.

The movie stars an excellent cast headlined by Sean Astin and Lou Gosset Jr., and co-starring Denholm Elliot, Wil Wheaton, R. Lee Ermey, Jerry Orbach, Mason Adams, Keith Coogan, Andrew Divoff, and Michael Champion.

I can't vouch for the DVD copy of this film as I haven't seen it yet, but I would imagine it is as good or better than broadcast versions of the film which isn't saying much. I plan on getting it and updating my review accordingly.",1469145600,,1487,4.7335907335907335

440353,4,630222540X,"Made in 1991 and starring Sean Astin of The Goonies fame this is about a nasty Colombian drugs lord who gets himself extradited to the United States to serve a lengthy prison sentence. His son decides he will get his father back to nose candy heaven and so attacks the prep school where the son of the judge  who sentenced his father  is boarding. This is to use the hostage to gain daddys freedom.

When he gets there with a small army all hell breaks loose. The boys though decide they are not going to take it lying down and organise a fight back. Now this is not a feel good movie with good winning with a smile on its face. There are some pretty nasty scenes here of violence and some full on action. There is no CGI either and you can tell that a lot of cash was thrown at this and mostly to good effect.

There are also some noteworthy support stars here in the shapes of Louis Gossett Jnr and the legendary Denholm Elliott. Some of the outcomes are predictable but despite that this film has stood the test of time reasonably well and is still a very good watch indeed.",1450915200,,1077,4.239024390243903

440414,5,630222540X,"Somewhere in Colombia, a ruthless terrorist by the name of Luis Cali along with his equally ruthless henchmen has taken over the Palace of Justice. He orders the judge to release his drug lord father, Enrique Cali--only to learn that he's already been transported to a US prison, awaiting trial. After doing some research, Enrique discovers that the son of the judge overseeing his father's trial goes to a boarding school for teenage boys with wealthy and influential parents named Regis High.

The school is commonly a victim of harmless but degenerative pranks at the hands of pranksters Billy Tepper, Hank Giles, Joey Trotta, Ricardo Montoya, Phil Donoghue, and Jonathan Bradberry. They commonly find themselves in trouble with higher up, Dean Parker. Upon learning about this school, Enrique along with his second-in-command, Jack Thorpe, an ex-American, escape by helicopter and enter the US through the Mexican border.

After killing the school's security officer, Enrique and an army of henchmen invade the school and take the students as hostages. They fill the school, top to bottom with remote-detonated explosives and firerarms and Enrique threatens to hold the school captive and kill anyone who tries to stop him until his father is released from prison. With that going on; Billy Tepper, the leader of the group of prankster rejects bands his friends together to form their own army to try and stop the criminals. But will an army of determined teenage boys be enough to stop a ruthless army of trigger happy terrorists?

Overall: I'll just go ahead and admit it. The only reason this movie drew my attention is because I found out Andrew Divoff played a big role in this movie and I just happen to be a major fan of Andrew Divoff and movies he's involved in. Divoff plays a spectacular role in this film as the ruthless Colombian terrorist leader, Enrique Cali. Wil Wheadon fans will be happy to know that Wheadon, at a young age, appears in this movie in a great performance. Honestly, everyone does terrific in their roles. It's an amazingly well told teen action film beginning to end",1432857600,,2103,4.935028248587571

440565,2,630222540X,"Toy Soldiers, 1991 film

Gunmen take over a Colombia courtroom and kidnap a judge. Then we see a prep school where teenagers play a prank on a school guard. Federal marshals visit one student whose father is a Federal judge in the Enrique Cali case. The school gates are closed at night. Some students have a secret exit from the building. They make a telephone call to a woman and are caught. [Some never learn.] A group of terrorists cross the border and shoot the Border Patrol. Why do those other students follow one student? They move furniture outside. Two trucks enter the school, machine guns fire, people are killed! The local sheriff is notified; there is drama. What can they do without a larger military force? The terrorists want a prisoner released, or all will die.

The students discuss their situation. They make notes about their captors. They have a plan. One student escapes to report on the terrorists. The military have a plan, but they are allowed to make a deal. So too the Mob to free the son of a gangster. But there is a hitch in the plans! Will his father plan revenge? Now the US military must go in to rescue the students. Can the students find shelter in this school? One student creates a diversion in the cafeteria, others take action. The US forces move in to neutralize the terrorists (a Gatling gun). Helicopters land with soldiers. The terrorists rule is over! Good guys with guns stopped bad guys with guns. There is a happy ending for the survivors. Will this reform the students? Does it provide a lesson to its viewers?

This is based on a novel by William P. Kennedy. Was it as good as the book? If you can accept the implausible story of a gang of terrorists taking over a school in a countryside you may find it acceptable. Its like a lesson where individuals must cooperate to meet a common threat. But can boys used to playing tricks and pranks suddenly change their character? I hope so. What does the higher social class of these students tell about their future and the corporations they will run?",1408838400,,2046,4.569482288828338

The film centers on a prep school, Regis, and a group of unruly friends led by Billy Tepper (Astin), who has been kicked out of multiple schools before this one.  Along with friends Joey Trotta (Wheaton), a mobster's son; Keith Coogan (Bradberry), the artist; Ricardo Montoya (Perez), the translator; and Hank Giles (Russell), the token.  Together they form the school's upper-class leadership, the guys with the best pranks and Listerine-vodka, the admired school celebrities.  Along the way they must match wits with Edward Parker (Gossett, Jr.), the tough-love approach Dean who serves as a mentor.

When the school is taken over by South American terrorists who are armed to the teeth with machine guns, explosives, and ransom demands, guess which kids just happen to be part of VERY wealthy and very influential families, and therefore important in the ransom plot?  Naturally, the Regis ""Rejects"" pause from zit popping to bravely band together and concoct a plan that may as well have been hatched in the Mystery Machine.  Somehow, however, despite the fact that their plan requires the theft of a military HMMWV, and hinges upon a remote controlled UFO/plane hybrid owned by a kid named ""Yogurt,"" the surrounding military and Parker agree that it's probably the best bet for success.  You can't make this stuff up.

From beginning to end, this movie is enjoyable.  The acting is top-notch, and head terrorist Luis Cali - portrayed convincingly by Andrew Divoff - should get more attention for his fine work.  Once the first act is over the direction doesn't allow for a dull moment the rest of the way.  Great action, funny situations, heck, even the score is memorable.  The only egregious flaw in this movie is the casting of pipe-cleaner thin Will Wheaton as a tough mobster son.  If there is a worse casting misfire in Hollywood history I'd like to see it.

This is a textbook, classic version of enjoyable, completely unbelievable movie.  It's right up there with Red Dawn and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Eagle/dp/0767827686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Eagle</a>&nbsp;(in which Louis Gossett, Jr. also stars) for me, and not only will I watch all three whenever they come TV, I'll defend them as well.  With the absolutely ridiculous premise of a boarding school being infiltrated and controlled by a South American terrorist group who fall to the logistics and strategy of a handful of mavericky kids who probably failed algebra and are inexplicably led by a 5-foot-nothing hero in Sean Astin, it just can't be taken seriously.  But it's fun the entire movie, and I highly recommend it for a good, hands-off time.

I had forgot Ermey was in this, so it was a pleasant surprise. Astin and Gossett turn in great performances.

440922,3,630222540X,"Well, when I was a kid you had the Hardy Boys, but by the 90s even the updated Hardys (no more tooling around in 'roadsters') were pretty passe.  TOY SOLDIERS has been described as a teen version of DIE HARD, and filmmaker Daniel Petrie was certainly savvy enough to realize that since it was largely that very age group that was responsible for the success of high action films starring macho actors approaching (if not already well into) middle age, how could he go wrong if he adhered to the basic formula but made his heroes rebellious teens instead of wiseacre adults?

And for what it is, it does work.  Younger viewers are not likely to realize how derivative and formulaic this movie about terrorists taking over a private school for rebellious kids really is.  TOY SOLDIERS is definitely a teen film for the 90s (and beyond) in its relatively frank use of profanity, casual mentions of masturbation and its depiction of a prank phone call to an adult service.  Contemporary teens will likely find this an ""authentic"" touch.  Their parents may be surprised--and some a bit disconcerted--to see how far beyond the Hardy Boys we've come.  Frank and Joe never used the ""F"" word.

But some things never do change, and the film's basic appeal to young viewers is the same as that of boys' action adventure tales from time immemorial.  Or at least as long as there have been boys' action adventure stories.  The fantasy of kids being able to competently and heroically maneuvre in the adult world will always hold an appeal for younger audiences.  Hey, movies about rebel teens being able to put one over on the headmaster are cool enough.  But when they can subdue a gang of terrorist thugs, hey, that's waaay cool.",1142121600,4,1718,4.709030100334449

It is by no means a masterpiece, and it will never be confused with art, but it is one of those enjoyable, popcorn eating, junk flix that suck you in every time you flip past it on TBS.  It is a guilty pleasure of mine that I rate up there with ROAD HOUSE, NEXT OF KIN, and VICTORY.
That being said, I was thrilled when I saw that this was available on DVD!  Without reading the description carefully, I quickly ordered and anxiously awaited the delivery person, popcorn in hand.  Caution should have been displayed, and perhaps the description should have been read by me.
Folks, this DVD is NOT IN WIDESCREEN.  I have no one to blame but myself, because it is clearly listed as a full screen disc.  But seriously... in this era of movie-friendliness, why oh why even bother with full screen releases anymore?  Columbia/Tristar usually does an admirable job with their DVD packages, and for the most part provides a widescreen transfer.  A lot of their discs offer both presentations, which is fine, but if you are going to choose one, full screen is the wrong way to go.
So my rant here folks is not at the seller, or the content.  It is at the studio for not bothering to give us the original aspect ratio of this cool little movie.  That is why it gets only two stars.  In all honesty, with something like The Godfather getting five stars and a Finding Nemo getting four, you can't give this movie more than three.  But it would have been a solid three in widescreen.  Note to all studios... release your movies in their OAR.

That better way is to go after the son of the federal judge hearing the case.  This son is removed from the prep school, just in case something like this should happen.  However, the terrorists do not know that and attack it anyways.
Louis Gossett Jr. does a good job as a warden... I mean, school headmaster.

I remember when Toy Soldiers first came out, I must have seen it three or four times in the thearters alone.  Then when it was released on vhs, I watched it another fifty or so, over the years.  The film never got the recognition it deserved, and because of that, it kind of just fell to the waste side.  In my opinion, this is one of the best films of the last decade.  The story, acting, and fx were all excellent.  The film is about a prep school for boys that gets taken over by terrorists.  The Regis school is where the country's best families send the world's worst students.  Although, the students are not really all that bad, they do get into trouble quite often.  The films centers on one particular group of friends at the school.  Sean Astin((""Rudy"")as Billy Tepper) is the star of the film, but the other's do as good a job.  Others in the group include Wil Wheaton((""Stand By Me"")as Joey Trotta) and Keith Coogan((""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitters Dead"")as Jonathan Bradberry).  They are all on the school's scoccer team and also room together.  The U.S. takes the head terrorist's father into custody and that's where everything begins.  The terrorists, led by Luis Cali(Andrew Divoff(Fuast-Love Of The Dammed)), first take over the courthouse where the judge that put his father away is.  They demand that the judge tell them where they took Luis's father and want him released immediately.  But when the judge won't say anything, they force him into a chopper, take off from the courthouse roof, and toss him out.  When Luis Cali learns that the judge's son is living at the Regis School, he figures they can use him as a trade off for his father.  Not suspecting anything, but just to be safe, the FBI takes the judge's son out of the school and into protective custody.  The boy's at the Regis School are in the middle of lunch in the cafateria, when Luis and his gang get there.  They walk right in and shoot a round from a machine gun into the ceiling of the cafateria, causing all the boys to drop to the floor.  They seal off all the enterances and exits, and wire the entire building with explosives.  They have check points at all corners of the roof, two guys at each with sub-machine guns and rocket launchers.  When Luis Cali learns that the judge's son has left the school, he has his people look through the school files to see who else he can use as a trade-off for his father.  He decides that there are enough important families, who will cause problems for the government if they don't adhere to his demands, who have there kid at the Regis school.  Billy and his friends agree that they have to do something to help the police and military that are now surrounding the school.  They create a plan that will get Billy to the other side to tell everyone where each of the terrorists are positioned and what type of weapons they have.  The plan works fine and everything seems to be working out, until one of the boys in their group is shot and killed.  Billy decides that helping the authorities isn't the best idea because somebody else might get killed.  But his friends tell him that he can't back out now, that everyone is  counting on them to do what they said they would.  So everything is back on, and the military, along with the help of Billy and co., set out to bring the terrorists down.  I almost forgot to mention Louis Gossett Jr, who plays Dean Parker in the film.  He, as everyone else, does a fantastic job.  I don't want to go into anymore detail because you have to see this movie for yourself.  There isn't a boring or slow part in any of the film.  You definitely won't be disappointed with this one.

441005,3,630222540X,"I find `Toy Soldiers' to be a somewhat passable bit of action entertainment, although it's not all that extraordinary. Sean Astin leads a group of high-class reform school kids in an effort to stop the terrorist group that has overtaken the campus. Kinda like low-rent `Die Hard' with hunky-looking teenage boys, which leads me to believe that this flick was aimed more at the teenage female demographic. Louis Gossett, Jr., playing the school headmaster, seems to be just biding his time between `Iron Eagle' flicks here. So unless you're really desperate for a group-of-teenage-kids-saving-the-day flick filled with naughty language and exit wounds, you might wanna just pass this by.
Fortunately, `Toy Soldiers' does have one redeeming quality: the demise of Wil Wheaton's character by high-velocity lead. For a trekkie who's always disliked Wheaton's Wesley Crusher character on NextGen, this particular moment is a real treat. I'm hoping they'll put this on DVD someday just so I can loop this  scene and watch it over and over and over again, heh. God, I love DVDs...
