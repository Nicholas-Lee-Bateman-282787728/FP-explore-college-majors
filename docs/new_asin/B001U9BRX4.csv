3797410,5,B001U9BRX4,"I rented this DVD on Netflix after seeing Bela Fleck play with Toumani Diabate at Oakland's Yoshi's night club; it was an awesome show and the DVD doesn't disappoint.  A close musician friend thought Bela was 'too cerebral', but I think the show changed his mind.

About this DVD:  Bela seems a bit eager to please in the main part of the film, but as it grows on you, there is an emerging and distinct sense of his enchantment and love in this adventure.  The specials are tight, fun, and wide-ranging in style - all done with a genuine presence of spirit, a good dose of humility, and humor.

A long-time guitarist, I had been inspired by Pete Seeger over the (many) years, and particularly on the advent of his 90th birthday, but this movie made me buy a banjo :-)

I'm buying the DVD and maybe the CD to boot!",1259452800,4,813,4.3509933774834435
3797411,5,B001U9BRX4,Beautiful. This DVD shows what a gentle soul can achieve through music and human tolerance. My gratitude to Bela Fleck and his team for showing us the timeless music of Africa and its great spirit.,1257897600,3,197,4.6571428571428575
3797412,5,B001U9BRX4,"Bela Fleck's journey to Africa is nominally about ""finding the roots of the banjo."" In reality Fleck's journey became an iconic odyssey into his own identity as a musician. As Fleck travels from one village to another, encountering splendid African musicians, you get a glimpse of the sheer power of the universal language that we call music. Sascha Paladino, Fleck's brother and the film's director, has an amazing ability to capture the subtle interactions between the musicians, even when they did not speak the same verbal language. The production team did a hero's work--usually in very primitive circumstances--capturing the unique sound of some amazing African instruments. For its humor, its musicality and its sheer humanity -- do not miss this film.",1257206400,4,759,5.2809917355371905
3797413,5,B001U9BRX4,"Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and now, Bela Fleck demonstrate the healing power of an authentic art form--before use value degenerates into exchange value, to cop a phrase from Marx.

Once said art form--in this case radical folk music--becomes commodified, it is lost to us. Once the artist is seduced he is longer that. Priest becomes pimp--which is the capitalist State in the US in essence.

For that reason Fleck needed to travel to the cradle of civilization, all but abandoned by the ""civilized world,"" owing to their great distress, and, therefore areas still exist which remain relatively untouched by the corrupt corporate State here at Empire.

The folk music there beats on. Save the rain forests, save the species, save that which heals the dis-eased West.

All three are done for...

""Half of all children under five years of age in South Asia and one third of those in sub-Saharan Africa are malnourished.""

3797414,5,B001U9BRX4,"wow, i JUST came back from watching this at an indie theater in chicago. LOVE IT! bela is an african brother! western media only portrays africa in terms of despair, destruction, disaster, disease and destitution.

Bela shows the joy of African music and how music is truly universal. it may sound cheesy, but it's a wonderful documentary. the cinematography is beautiful as well. bela meets with fabulous people. this doc. is so rich and uplifting. bela is truly a gift and using his talent to do more than what most of today's pop singers don't have the guts/skills to do.",1250640000,20,574,4.74
3797415,5,B001U9BRX4,"I just had the opportunity to see this documentary at a local independent theater. I thought ""Banjos and Africa? Random! But could be fun..."" I was so so so underestimating the power of this film! The music is nothing short of tremendous (one piece in particular, in the first quarter of the film, is virtually guaranteed to leave you breathless and astounded), Incredible, passionate voices and remarkable instruments combine to form sounds that will grab your soul and shake it.

Bela is fun to watch as he interacts with African musicians of various calibers. I love how unassuming he is, and how he speaks (as one of the African musicians points out) perfectly through his music, although his mouth sometimes fails him. What a remarkably talented and humble guy!

All in all, 5 stars +++. I went home and bought the MP3 album immediately, and can't wait to buy the DVD. :)",1246233600,24,876,4.756578947368421

Bla's own musicianship and his respect for history, the presiding culture and the talents of others is palpable.  I had the pleasure of hearing his brother and director/co-producer Sasha Paladino speak back when it first came out on the big screen in 2008.

3797427,5,B001U9BRX4,"I bought this as a gift to give my favorite Aunt for her birthday. She had recently returned from a trip to Africa. And had many marvelous stories of her adventures while there.  I had seen Bela Fleck Throw Down Your Heart on Amazon Prime & instantly was enchanted.  If you believe that music is an international language that requires no interpreter then this DVD will not disappoint.  Bela takes the viewer along with him to discover the source of the instrument he plays.  While watching him interact with these people who live so far away but closely feel the sheer joy music can bring was an incredible viewing experience.  Not only did I learn a lot about the orgins of Bela's instrument I discovered that this DVD gave me a unique experience.  The viewer gets to hear, see and feel the music of Africa.  I know my Aunt will love Bela Fleck Throw Down Your Heart.",1409529600,,869,4.496815286624204

3797431,5,B001U9BRX4,"I don't hear much coming out of Africa that isn't bad news.  I once overheard a white man of European descent on a college snowshoeing trip talk about how ""africa is just hopeless.""  It was quite a disturbing and problematic framework for a conversation, considering his race and background.

Here enters Bela Fleck, with a third installment of his wonderful Tales from the Acoustic Planet.  This time, he travels to Africa to explore the musical and instrumental connections between his beloved bluegrass and various African musical traditions across the continent.

Entertaining, uplifting, insightful, and inspiring -- as Mic Crenshaw says, ""amidst poverty is prosperity.""  Bela Fleck and his musical counterparts in Africa break down all sorts of barriers with the power of music.  In the process, they discover their fundamental humanity and how deeply it ties to our common need to make and experience rhythm, melody and harmony.

Although it's not strictly intended as an anti-racist, anti-colonial statement, I think it's the most powerful point of the project.  Learning the meaning of the phrase ""throw down your heart"" alone is worth the price of admission, and I challenge anyone to experience this project and not come away with a newfound respect for the courage, resilience and strength of the human soul.",1401753600,,1320,5.218009478672986
3797432,5,B001U9BRX4,"This is one of my favorite music documentaries. I think the stories of the musicians and the music that they make with Bela are phenomenal. I show it to my Music Appreciation class every semester and they are always touched and amazed by it. As a college professor I do wish that the structure were a bit more clear and that they would actually name the instruments that are played (they usually don't), but I love it anyway!",1397433600,,425,4.461538461538462

3797434,5,B001U9BRX4,"15 years ago I was introduced to Bela's music. I was hooked and have come to understand why he is such an incredible musician.  Certain artists are regarded as amazing for different reasons.  Its not just that he's one of the most talented banjo players ever, its the way that he plays with other musicians and transcends the traditional American banjo genre.
This documentary is a great example of Bela mixing with other artists from Africa to create not only beautiful and unique music, but very touching moments in human interaction. In all of the collaborations, he infuses HIS banjo playing with THEIR style of music.  In my opinion, he didn't come to African villages to dominate and blow away everybody, he came because he wanted to learn different styles of music and play with some of the greatest musicians in Africa.
Its a wonderful experience.  It makes me smile every time I watch it.  Thanks, Bela.",1394150400,,912,4.7834394904458595

showed the best we have to offer.",1391212800,,305,4.016393442622951
3797438,5,B001U9BRX4,Based on the idea that the banjo was developed in the US but really came from African instruments. Our host brings the instrument to Africa and attempts to blend in with the music there.  The results are interesting as he meets lots of talented musicians.  I watched this with my 1 year old daughter and she was riveted every time they played a song.  1 year olds are not noted for long attention spans....she enjoyed this musical documentary as much as I did.,1390089600,,460,4.518072289156627

In this video, he travels to several different parts of Africa in an avowed attempt to connect his instrument to its African roots.

Along the way, he (and we) become familiar with some wonderfully different people and places.

If you don't think you like the banjo, like me, try this anyway. I liked the video even more than the CD because you feel like you're on the journey, and it is a good one.

The story was good, the scenes from Africa were amazing and the music was very good.  The sound editing was astounding!  Bela is an amazing musician and the musicians he found in Africa were very good.  I'm just beginning to appreciate African wines so I guess I will also start learning to appreciate the roots of African music.  Hey, how about a bottle of African wine to drink while watching the film?  Now there's an idea!",1339113600,,689,4.590163934426229
3797479,5,B001U9BRX4,"Bela travels to Africa - the perfect ambassador of the banjo, meeting and playing without contrivance. It is so beautiful to see the children singing and dancing, and the adults jamming.

There is so much emotion here (what they obviously are feeling, and what that evokes in us the audience) - joy mostly and free creativity, but the underlying message is how this is founded on the fragile, tough uncertainty of life. Everyone knows this basic truth, but rarely have I seen it expressed so simply and clearly and heartfelt. (As Bela said at one point near the beginning of his tour, ""I don't think I've ever felt like this"".)

Overall - great footage, great music, great people - great documentary.",1335484800,,700,4.776859504132231

The video captures Bela's gentle nature and collaborative spirit, and the positive effect of those attributes on his hosts. Especially for those of us who harbor negative stereotypes about Africa, this 90-minute DVD proposes an alternative. Parts of Africa look hot, humid, dusty, and fly/mosquito-infested, but these discomforts are overwhelmed by the hospitality, love of life, and musical talent shown by the people Bela encounters. There are many remarkable scenes. My favorite occured around the 20-minute mark, when Ruth Akello expertly played the finger piano, normally a man's role.",1333584000,2,789,5.32
3797481,3,B001U9BRX4,"The parts I enjoyed: Watching Bela play; seeing the interaction between the various African musicians; having the Western and African musicians working and jamming together; that part was FANTASTIC.

The parts I didn't need: the PBS production was silly and maudlin, as if the editor or director was trying to engender sympathy or revulsion, I couldn't tell which way it was leaning. That became so tiresome to watch that I turned it off about halfway through.

Bottom line: Music = GOOD; production (directing, editing, camera work) = NOT.

If you can turn this on and listen to it without watching it you'd probably enjoy it, because the music is really good.",1332288000,,661,4.936936936936937

The guy himself seems to be a real human being, and that is a contributing factor in my enjoyment of this movie.  He is so kind, gentle, and caring in his interactions with the amazing African musicians.

I loved this film.  The African musicians were great - I realize that they were in their comfort zones unlike Fleck, another kudo for him, but still the music was super.  You could hear Lightin Hopkins, Aretha Franklin, etc.

3797484,4,B001U9BRX4,"If you're a fan of B&eacute;la Fleck or interested in traditional African music you've probably already watched this movie a dozen times.  For everybody else, it's a good introduction.

The premise of the movie is that Fleck, the world's premier banjo player, wants to bring the banjo back to Africa to get in touch with its roots.  He wants to learn about African music, and at the same time he wants to share what he knows about the banjo.  To that end he travels to four different countries (Uganda, Tanzania, Gambia, and Mali), jamming with local musicians every place he goes.

Fleck has an excellent ear and a friendly disposition that helps him get along with various musicians.  Not every encounter is magical, but despite a few awkward moments every encounter is interesting, and there are enough magical moments to keep the film's momentum going.

Fleck works surprising well as an accompanist.  He has the fingers of a virtuoso and his head is overflowing with melodic ideas, so one expects him to shine the brightest when he is soloing.  However, in this film we see him doing some of his most beautiful work when he's backing up vocalists.

The scene with Ruth Akello was marvelous, Walusimbi Haruna's song was moving, and the studio recording of ""Djorolen"" with Oumou Sangare was out of this world.

The sound engineering for the entire movie was excellent.  All of the instruments and singing voices were audible, while extraneous sounds were filtered out.

This film doesn't earn my highest recommendation because as a documentary about the banjo or about African music it could have been much more informative.  The connection of the banjo to the Indian Ocean and Atlantic slave trade was imagined but not developed.  However, as a document of Fleck's encounters with African musicians, it is better than most music tour documentaries.  There are some wonderful moments and overall it is edifying.",1320624000,,1914,4.952978056426332

Time was that man was called the ""only animal that makes and uses tools"". As Bela so poignantly demonstrates, we're the only animal that makes and uses music: to entertain, to comfort, and to remember. It's the touchstone of human connectivity across time and distance.

3797492,5,B001U9BRX4,"Mother Africa is the cradle of our species. She has also given birth to so much of our music that we sometimes lose our ear for its origins. ""I thought it was important for people to realize where the banjo comes from because it is so much associated with a white Southern stereotype,"" says Bela Fleck, the world's primo virtuoso of this instrument. In ""Throw Down Your Heart"", he documents his six-week sojourn to Africa to discover whether the modern banjo still has a vibrant voice in the land where it was born.
  The banjo is a descendant of an instrument that African slaves brought to the New World in the 16th century. It sat in the laps of musicians in cane and cotton fields, in plantation shacks and sheds, atop the levees and bales of raw goods that stood along the rivers that brought the blues to the bustling gulf ports.
  By the early 19th century, the banjo was an essential element in plantation cakewalks and white minstrelsy. It accompanied sailors in their sea chanteys and traveled west with hopeful miners toward the Gold Rush. After the Civil War, the presentation banjo was adopted as a parlor instrument alongside the player piano. In the early 20th century, it sang in the ragtime orchestra and the Dixieland band. By the 1930s, the banjo had disappeared from the jazz ensemble, though it continued to flourish in folk music and in the jigs and reels of barn dances in the Appalachian states that reached a national audience through radio broadcasts. In the mid-1940s, the banjo burst forth as an instrument of arresting brilliance when it was featured in bluegrass music.
  In the four countries on his itinerary, Bela Fleck steers clear of big cities and large venues. He, along with sound engineer Dave Sinko and director Sascha Paladino's filmmaking crew, head for the bush and the villages ""to play with great African musicians and find a role for the banjo in their music.""
  In each of the stops, Bela connects with a musician to serve as host and translator and to introduce the party to locals and their particular instruments and tradition. He emphasizes that he has no wish to be front and center among the players, but prefers to take a seat on the backbench. In every group setting, he adds his banjo's voice as if he were politely joining a conversation already in progress.
  The first destination is Uganda. The filmmakers stage a boisterous audition in Jinja to recruit musicians familiar with the local music. From there, the party travels to the village of Nakisenyi. In nearby Lwanika, Bela meets his first guide, Walusimbi Haruna, a professional musician whose specialty is the thumb piano. ""Music is in every aspect of life,"" Haruna explains. The visit includes a stop at the grave of Haruna's late father, where burial customs in Africa and America are compared. In a touching moment, Bela is visibly caught off guard when Haruna is overcome with grief as they play a song about his father.
  The thumb piano is culturally regarded as a man's instrument, but Jinja's prodigy, it turns out, is Ruth Akello, a woman who sings like an angel and plays like a ""wizard."" Nakisenyi possesses an enormous marimba, a communal instrument played by many people at once that sounds ""like a rock band.""
  The filmmakers depart Nakisenyi with sadness. Dabbing at tears, Bela notes, ""I felt truly welcomed.""
  The second destination gives the film its name. ""Bagamoyo"", in Tanzania, means ""throw down your heart."" Bagamoyo was a seaside collection point for the transport of slaves. Unfortunate captives knew that when they glimpsed the sea they should throw down their hearts because they would never see their homes again.
  The Tanzanian guide is John Kitime. Bela had hoped he might meet Hukwe Zawose, the legend of traditional Gogo music, but is disappointed to learn that Zawose had died a few years earlier. He is delighted to find blind vocalist and thumb pianist Anania Ngoliga alive and well. The two compose and record seamless inventions from their very first session.
  At a brief stopover in Dar Es Salaam, Bela becomes acquainted with determinedly tribal young Masai, who are pleased to demonstrate their traditional forms of dance.
  The travelers cross the continent for their third destination, the Gambia, believed to the birthplace of the banjo. Sniffing the Gambian air, Bela quips, ""I can smell banjo.""
  Jil Ekona Jatta is the Gambian guide. He introduces Bela to the akonting, a 3-string banjo ancestor. We see an akonting constructed as American banjos had been until the early 1800s: an animal skin is nailed to a hollowed calabash with a shaved hardwood pole run through it. After several days of drying in the sun, a carved bridge is glued to the head and strings of gut or hemp fiber are attached.
  ""It felt really natural playing with the musicians in Gambia,"" Bela reports. ""It felt like the banjo was supposed to be there.""
  The fourth and final stop is Bamako, Mali, the ""crown jewel of the African music community."" The hostess is Oumou Sangare, the great ""songbird"" of Mali's Wassulu music, who owns the hotel the filmmakers enjoy during their stay and who moves among adoring crowds with the regal grace of one born to the purple.
  Bassekou Kouyate, the town griot (""keeper of customs"") introduces Bela to guitar hero Djelimady Tounkara and Kamal ngoni master Harouna Samake.
  As we listen to the handcrafted lutes, harps, flutes, whistles, shakers, and drums of contemporary Africans, we are hearing instruments designed to perpetuate continuity with the ancestral past as well as the throbbing heart of the present. Some of this very music comforted the enslaved people dragged away to the Americas.
  Music of all cultures in every age evokes exuberance and despondency, celebration and rapture, discovery and contemplation. The modern banjo evolved to express the musical forms of our European-derived Western tradition with its machined instruments and tempered tuning systems. Does the banjo have a role in African music? Of course it does because the voice belongs to the player not the instrument. ""I just want to make great music,"" says Bela Fleck, a man of endless imagination and expansive heart. His banjo voice is and always has been sublime. In every setting it is truly welcomed.",1276041600,18,6269,4.9109004739336495
3797493,5,B001U9BRX4,"I feel that this documentary has opened my mind to great new styles of music.  If you are a fan of other Bela Fleck projects, African music, or any music in its purest organic form, buy this.  Thanks Bela.",1274572800,,205,4.230769230769231
3797494,4,B001U9BRX4,I enjoyed this documentary. You follow celebrated banjo player Bela Fleck around Africa while he meets up with incredible musicians and they play together and make great music. Knowing that his instrument has African roots Bela wanted to explore African music and the results of his journey were fruitful. I had the opportunity to see Bela Fleck live this year along with some of the musicians featured in this film and it was one of the greatest live music experiences of my life.,1273968000,,481,4.807228915662651
3797495,5,B001U9BRX4,"This is a fantastic look at some amazing African musicians interacting with an amazing American musician.  At first it seems awkward, partly because Bela is so unassuming.  But then the music starts and everyone is equal.  It is a very moving tribute to the musicians and their music.  It is wonderful to see the admiration and amazement in Bela's expression when listening to Anania and others.  Do not miss the 64 bonus minutes of jams that didn't make the final cut of the documentary.  They alone are worth the price.  I highly recommend this DVD if you have any interest in World Music or are a Bela Fleck fan.  In a stellar career this may be a defining moment.  If I were Bela, I'd worry about what's next.  He is doing a 33 date tour in the US with some of the featured artists.  See it if you can.",1265155200,,806,4.342281879194631
3797496,3,B001U9BRX4,"I liked the African music a lot. I'm a banjo player, and have recently become very interested in the African roots of an instrument. So I grabbed this as soon as I saw it on the shelf at my local movie rental place.

The film is very simple; just Bela interacting with other musicians and singers. His somewhat quiet but affable manner fits nicely with his hosts - he doesn't come across as some fancy rock star at all and really lets the African musicians shine. And it's those African musicians who really do make the film so special. I was touched by the woman marimba player: they said that ""typically the marimba was a male instrument - but that woman is a wizard!""

My one  (major) complaint is that there wasn't very much *information* in the film. The meaning of the phrase ""Throw Down Your Heart"" was moving, but there was little else. For instance, when in Gambia and showing the instruments being played, it would have been very nice to point out that the musicians were playing in the 'clawhammer' style - a style used in Southern US old-time music (the strings are played with the backs of the fingernails), demonstrating nicely that both the instrument and the way it is played have their roots among the African slaves. I also would have a liked a little more info about the instruments themselves, their history and the variety of ways to play them.

I think Bela's primary interest was simply to *play* the banjo with his African friends, and the film shows that very well.",1264982400,8,1490,4.569288389513108

I watched it again and enjoyed it even more than the first time.  Bela is a very quiet, unassuming person and you can see the joy on his face as he played with local musicians.  What was a wonderful highlight is the extra on the DVD.  It is Bela and his brother (his producer) talking about their travels and the challenges of recording the music often in less than acoustically ideal settings.

I went to a private screening in Beverly HIlls, as I heard that Bela Fleck would be present, and I was anxious to re-connect with him.  I had supervised the music for THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES MOVIE, and i had hired Bela to record the theme song in the early 90's.  The film took me by total surprise.  This documentary follows Bela as he traces the roots of the banjo through various African countries.  From the first encounter I was riveted.  I have always been a huge fan of African music, much more so than traditional American banjo music.  The initial clash, and then blending of the two musical worlds has created one of the most intriguing soundtracks of recent memory. As the unlikely white boy musician arrives with his peculiar instrument in remote villages to meet local musicians,  the magic begins and they discover and respect each others' unique talents.  I purchased the soundtrack CD before leaving the theatre. I have told many friends about the importance of this picture, and with total agreement from all of them.  When I learned the DVD was finally available, i rushed to purchase it.  However it has now become the property of my 15 year old daughter, who became enchanted with the music months ago from the CD.  This music constantly is playing in our home or car, and we've yet to tire of it.  I give this film my highest rating!  Enjoy!",1261008000,8,1430,4.600790513833992

3797503,5,B001U9BRX4,"Having lived in Mali for four magical years during the 1980's I have been delighted at the ""discovery"" of Malian music by Western musicians in the past several decades.  Ry Cooder, Jimmy Page and now Bela Fleck, just to name a few, have been fortunate to travel to and fall in love with the glorious wonder that is Mali.  I am not a musician but was often struck by the similarities in sound and heart of many Malian instruments and styles of music similar to those found in the United States..namely blues and the banjo.  I found Bela Fleck's film to be entertaining and educational from beginning to end.  I love how he started out much farther south on the continent and picked up on that thread one finds throughout Africa.  The warmth, the rhythm, the struggle to survive in a meaningful way that wends its way through all of sub-Saharan Africa.  My only disappointment was, that when he finally arrived in Mali, that he did not connect with some of the outstanding Kora players, that most regal of all Malian instruments. It perhaps does not have such a direct link with the banjo, but flatten those strings and turn it towards your body and it sure sounds like Mother of Banjo to me!  I heartily recommend this film for anyone who loves music and loves people.  It will enrich your life.",1260144000,,1294,4.547413793103448

We were not acquainted with Bela Fleck before, but we have lived in Africa for many years and we love authentic African music (not the big city beer hall music, but village music).  It was exciting to see several instruments we had never seen before.  Bela Fleck was received in the villages with true African hospitality and so obviously enjoyed ""jamming"" with musicians with whom he had no common language! He showed real respect for them, learned from them, and shared with them his love of music. We purchased several copies of the movie to share with friends.",1259971200,5,597,4.730769230769231

Even so, the footage of Fleck's musical encounters with African musicians in 4 countries was so delightful- the joy of these playful, loving moments as people from diverse cultures communicate with sound, not words- that I look forward to watching the film again, and to share it with friends.

So, I'm a bit biased..but I believe that my review is as objective as it can be. So, first I will give you what I think of as the ""bad"" point: I think this film is probably about one-half hour too long. Fortunately for you, if you agree, because you are buying the DVD, you can just end it whenever you want.

But you may not want to, despite how long it feels - because it's *incredibly* interesting.

You probably already  know that this is a documentary about Bela's journey to Africa to trace the roots of the banjo and banjo music.  This  documentary is incredibly well done, and will hold the interest of just about anybody, but *especially* if they are at all interested in the banjo, banjo music, world music, or Africa. (Or Bela or Sascha ;-) ).

This DVD would make a great gift for pretty much anybody with any of those interests, especially as, at least in my expierience, very few people - even those who know Bela's work - have heard of the movie, so it's very unlikely that they even will know about the movie, let alone already own it.
