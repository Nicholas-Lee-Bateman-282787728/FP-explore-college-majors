779792,2,6304087969,It's too bad they picked someone ancient to portray the hero.  He isn't meant to be that much older than Emma.  This is obviously done as a play and one frequently is left with the feeling the actors are just reciting speeches.,1415491200,,227,4.380952380952381
779793,3,6304087969,"You know the saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover?"" Well, don't judge a movie by its cover either! While this adaptation runs longer than most movies (a solid 4 1/2 hours total) it was definitely worth seeing. The length of the film gave believability and depth the the characters, and while it first seems rather theatrical in delivery, it progresses more and more naturally, and some theatrical qualities are absorbed into the personalities of the characters themselves. This was a faithful film adaptation of the book. I was exceedingly gratified. It is obvious that this is an older film (it was made in '72) particularly in the outside scenes, but it is forgivable. I must say that the most endearing character is poor Mr. Woodhouse. The old gentleman is lovably laughable, or maybe its laughably lovable. Either way, his character came across marvelously. I do highly suggest you see this film, even if it is over four hours long.",1413331200,3,940,4.84472049689441
779794,5,6304087969,"Emma is spiritedly played by Doran Godwin in this very enjoyable adaptation.  It may not have the snazzy production values as we are conditioned to expect nowadays, but the wit and engaging repartee are superb.  I was drawn to Emma right from the start.  The sparkle in her eyes and the overly self-confident attitude made me laugh.  I knew her match-making would be upside down and backwards.  There is great chemistry between all members of the cast, not a weak one in the bunch.

Because it is done as a mini-series, the subtleties of the characters and the complexity of the story line are able to be revealed at the appropriate leisurely pace.  Emma is, at heart, a mischievous young woman who will make you smile.  Funny, she is so busy trying to match everyone else up that she misses what's meant for her when it's right before her eyes.

I have three adaptations of this Austen classic.  This was my first and I have watched it more than once, enjoying it every time.  Don't worry about bells and whistles, this adaptation doesn't need it.  Just sit back, relax and enjoy a peak into the engaging mind of Jane Austen.

779878,5,6304087969,"I have just recently watched this 1972 ""Emma"" again and have decided to add my own comments. Before proceeding, let's be clear on this early BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's wonderful book. ""Emma"" is the most faithful version there is. As someone else posted, this isn't an over sexed or over feminized modern film for those who need that kind of kick. This is a mini series that represents a truer picture of how people lived, behaved, walked, talked, comported themselves, and thought in a  tightknit community during the nineteenth century in a particular country environment. One gets to see the rich interacting with the middle class and the poor. Therefore, since the whole book is virtually TAPED for the INDOOR scenes and FILMED for the OUTDOOR scenes the mini series takes its time to unfold which will cause some people to be bored by it since the pace is too slow for some. If one's attention span is limited or one needs faster action then this definitely is not the version for one.

  Secondly, this ""Emma"" is NOT a movie, rather, it is like a stage play with the roles performed by mostly theater trained actors. The way of emoting on the stage is clearly different from movie acting. If one has no appreciation for theater then, again, ""Emma"" will certainly disappoint one. However, if one is willing to have an open mind and give it a chance perhaps surprises are bound to strike one when least expected. The British public traditionally and historically has had a stronger affinity for theater than its American counterparts but, then again, to each his own although it is good to experience a different format when watching classics.

  Thirdly, since early BBC was on a tight budget back in its day, there is no high tech gadgetry or tricks in this production. Perhaps many of us are spoiled by the gilt and glitter of Hollywood's superior technological advances that some look down on excellent works not up to par or unwilling to accept fine gems simply because they may appear dull looking or simple. Well, all glitter is not gold. There are many movies out there that are visually stunning but whose storylines suck, are confusing, or lacking altogether. ""Emma"" has strong character developments so one knows who and what a certain character is and thinks. One does not confuse Emma Woodhouse with a Mrs. Elton or Mr. Knightly with Mr. Elton. If one is like me who dotes on good character development then all the furnishings, although sparse, do not distract from the overall storyline. This brings me to another point about the cast.

  Yes, the cast itself. Some people grumble that Doran Godwin isn't pretty enough or looks too old to play Emma Woodhouse while others say that John Carson is too old  or too pudgy to play Mr. Knightly. To that I say, again, perhaps Hollywood's focus on beauty, youth, and slimness somehow affects our perception of what also constitutes good actors. As always, the mega talented but not especially glamorous looking people holds some back from becoming true stars due to their ""ugly duckling"" status. Of course, fans of Jane Austen's books, especially, ""Emma"" have their own visualizations of how each character should look. Yet, when I think of it, what were the standards of beauty in nineteenth century England? Of course, women were considered better looking when not freckled but whatever the standards for men were one cannot possibly know. Certainly, the British themselves were never snobs about giving a particular role to very talented individuals regardless of their beauty, waistline, or age. Yet, I believe, 1972's ""Emma"" had a very excellent cast and it is enjoyable to watch them act. This requires an open mind.

  Last but not least, as mentioned before, although this mini series is faithful to the book a few liberties were taken. Bear in mind the difference between a book versus the film media. As one knows, a book needs to add details to let a reader know what the author has in mind when writing. A writer can be as wordy as she chooses but when adapting a book to a film sometimes insignificant scenes that do not allow for a smooth flow have to be eliminated. That is the cost of filming. However, as far as this ""Emma"" goes there is a particular scene that is puzzling. SPOILER ALERT! When Frank Churchill and Emma discuss as to the individual who might be the secret admirer of Jane Fairfax who was given a piano, there is a mention of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon as though they were an elderly couple. In the book, Mr. Dixon is engaged to Jane's best friend, Miss Campbell, and not yet married. Strange! Yet, if one has never read the book I suppose it makes no difference.

  In conclusion, if one is determined to purchase or rent ""Emma"" please keep an open mind. Perhaps it takes a while to get used to early BBC as it did me at first but in time you might learn to appreciate this and other classics that are true to the book.",1398643200,3,4911,4.685249709639954

779882,3,6304087969,"It's just ok. I didn't really enjoy many of the actors, the sets & scenery aren't great and I felt like it strayed from the book in a few unneccesary ways.

779883,5,6304087969,"An excellent, if old, adaptation of Emma. The Mr. Knightley character is the most attractive of all the versions of Mr Knightly. Mr Woodhouse is also very true to the book character, as is Miss Bates.",1348012800,,200,4.583333333333333
779884,5,6304087969,"This adaptation dates from the days before Jane Austen was Sexed Up and brought - heaving bosoms and all - into the modern world. So we get no scenes concocted by the writers, and not remotely hinted at in the original novel, of our hero plunging spontaneously into the pond in such a way as to evoke his Hidden Sensuality. Not a whiff of repressed sexuality intrudes; no, what we have here is very much what the author wrote and thus is likely to be considered stolid and dull by viewers steeped in modern-day Austen adaptations. The actors are relatively ordinary-looking and were obviously not selected primarily for their sex-appeal, there is very little ""emoting"" or ""passion"" (even of the underlying, Freudian-repressed kind), and the emotional crescendi never move beyond a mezzo-forte. Within its technical limitations (4/3 ratio, some 1970's graininess, slightly faded colours, drab exterior shots) it also looks both attractive and authentic. You could while a lot of hours away just looking at the furniture, prints, decorations, and general decor. Has there ever been an era with more perfect taste than the Regency period?

The acting is almost uniformly excellent in a slightly musty, old-fashioned way that may seem tedious to some viewers but I find it very Austen-like (after all, the early 19th Century IS somewhat musty and old-fashioned). I can only say that if you find this boring you're likely to find the original so as well. This is the most authentic adaptation of ""Emma"" available but it may not be the most entertaining for anyone seeking an overtly ""entertaining"" experience. You have to decide: are you after Austen or are you looking for costume drama?",1336435200,3,1683,5.010714285714286
779885,4,6304087969,"I've watched all of the screen adaptations of Jane Austen's Emma, and though my favorite is the version starring Romola Garai as Emma, this 1972 adaptation is the most faithful to the novel. Doran Godwin portrays meddlesome Emma Woodhouse, and I admit she is initially underwhelming in her role. There is a lack of vivacity that I've come to associate with Emma, but she is witty and over the course of this lengthy production (about 4.5 hours long), her character grew on me. The chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightley which was quite apparent in the Gwyneth Paltrow and Garai versions is sadly lacking here, but some of the other characters are quite well done.

Debbie Bowen's Harriet Smith is one of my personal favorites, and I think the actress portraying Harriet really gets her character down to a tee. Fiona Walker is suitably loathsome as Mrs. Elton, and Donald Eccles is wonderful as the hypochondriac yet lovable Mr. Woodhouse. Don't let the dated production values put you off this adaptation, as true Janeites will love this faithful, almost-to-the letter adaptation.",1326067200,3,1083,4.983425414364641
779901,4,6304087969,"Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy ""Emma"" comes to life in this 4 1/2 hour BBC TV production from 1972.  High quality TV production values and perfect settings frame a strong presentation with many excellent performances.

The handsome, clever, and rich Emma Woodhouse, 21 years-old and spoiled by a doddering father, sets out to play matchmaker in her home village of Highbury.  She chooses as her subject Harriet Smith, a young woman of uncertain parentage.  Emma will first curtail Harriet's promising relationship with a young farmer, in favor of matching her with the village vicar, Mr. Elton.  That effort goes disasterously astray on a holiday evening.

The arrival of the handsome and charming Mr. Frank Churchill in Highbury will shake up Emma's plans.  The newcomer will promptly set the village buzzing with romantic rumors, and even Emma herself will be captivated.  Only Emma's friendly mentor Mr. Knightley will be a voice of reason, as Emma's schemes lead to a series of misunderstandings that will cause her to finally question her own judgment.

This version of ""Emma"" is generally solidly cast, especially the actors playing Mrs. Elton and Harriet Smith.  Doran Godwin is a good Emma, although she appears a bit too old and rather prim for the role.  John Carson similarly appears too old for his otherwise excellent turn as Mr. Knightley.  This reviewer regrets the crucial Box Hill scene was mishandled through changes from its original form.  Otherwise, the BBC production of ""Emma"" is highly recommended to Jane Austen fans.",1324166400,2,1549,5.148

779903,4,6304087969,"When you watch something from 1972, you have the feeling you're already viewing something historic.  This is a classic BBC production of an even more classic story.  It may strike American audiences as a little odd because it has no background music to evoke emotions, and relies totally on the plot and acting.  It seems more like a play than a movie.  I've watched and enjoyed it many times and find it has the one unique quality I like in many Brit productions -- it's calming.  It's nice to hear perfect diction and understatement from astute actors playing genteel characters.  It's wonderful NOT to see constant rapid video flashes that drive people nuts.  You can watch or simply listen to this production like the radio and find yourself feeling better.  They even argue nicely.  Another quality in these productions is they replay well.  You can watch them a dozen times over the years and they're still good.  In a frantic and crazy world, this version of Emma is a pleasant and amusing escape into the past, where you can revisit and enjoy the people you find there.",1318809600,3,1077,4.705882352941177
779904,4,6304087969,"I chose this version of ""Emma"" because it was free with Amazon Prime. ""Emma"" and ""Mr. Knightly"" especially are likeable characters. What comes across poignantly is the economic/social need of early nineteenth-century women to marry in order to survive and to avoid spinsterhood and governess positions. The eponynous Emma is convincingly severe throughout the series. I recommend this production as being a good rendering of the original novel, the outlook of the people at the time, and also an interesting taste of 1970's acting and styles.",1308355200,,542,5.313953488372093
779905,2,6304087969,"It wasn't terrible, it really wasn't. Yes, it's got the usual sub-par production values and theater-like acting custom from the period dramas of the time, but I've thoroughly enjoyed  other adaptations made in the same way. Despite its length, it made a few changes to the story (such as making the Dixons a couple who wanted to hire Jane...?) that puzzled me. And it felt slightly boring and draggy at times as well. But I think the main reason I couldn't connect with it was the actors. Or really, one main actress- Emma herself.

She was my main problem with the series. I just couldn't connect with her at all. She came off as much older and more mature than the Emma of the book. I was shocked to read she was only 22 at the time, because I would have guessed her to be at least 30. I think it was the way she spoke- a very clipped, fakey aristocratic accent. At least I hope it was faked and that she didn't really talk like that in real life! I never saw any real emotion from her- it was all so artificial.

This is really one adaptation that I found so boring a lot of the time that I couldn't even find enough to say about it. I can't really recommend it except to complete a Jane Austen collection.",1304294400,2,1209,4.247826086956522
779906,5,6304087969,"Of all the many productions of Emma that I've seen, this is easily the best. While I doubt any filmmaker has ever set out with the intention of creating a bad film, many who took on the task of adapting Jane Austen's most daring novel accomplished just that. There are several factors which make this 1972 version work so well. Firstly, in this lengthy run-time the tale is given ample space to unfold. Secondly, the story itself takes center billing here instead of a famous cast out to use Austen's novel as  a vehicle to add some shade of ""heft"" to their careers. (No names, but we can probably all zero-in on some egregious examples.) Emma Woodhouse has never been quite so flawed, so off-putting, so likable and so many-faceted as she is here. The production is charmingly dated, special effects are virtually nowhere to be found amid the lovely old stage sets, and the dialogue is so crisp it is a sheer pleasure to listen to what's said here. While flashier adaptations exist with bigger names in the billing, in every way that counts, this is truly the definitive version of Emma!",1302480000,4,1088,4.637305699481865
779907,3,6304087969,"I have watched, I believe, all other Emmas available.  This is the one I enjoyed the least.  Emma didn't seem lovable, though I felt like I could relate to her better as I was starting to recognize her subtle facial expressions later on in the movie.  I thought Mr. Woodhouse was an interesting character in this movie, and I liked Mr. Elton.  This movie didn't make Mr. Elton seem like such a bad guy, which in all probability seems realistic.  I also thought Mrs. Bates was pretty good.

And just for the record, though I'm not an expert, there were definitely changes in dialogue and details in this movie.",1294790400,,609,4.541284403669724

But, alas, it was an untimely purchase because the newest ""Emma"" happened to appear on television. When I proudly presented 'my' gift version of ""Emma"" to My Beloved, she could not reconcile a ""plain Emma"" with the more attractive and vivacious newer model of the latest TV offering. (For my sake she toiled through it and then went out and bought the latest TV version.)

Sometimes life is cruel. Perhaps the real Emma was as plain-faced as the one I purchased, but I could never convince my wife of that.
That is why I have scored this ""Emma"" as 3 stars [""It's OK""]. The movie probably deserves a better score for the acting and storyline integrity, but I have discovered that I am as shallow as my wife.",1268265600,5,881,4.438271604938271

It is a ""video"" movie, shot on a sound stage using video rather than film and rather bland and washed out with minimal sets and furniture -- no shadows, no ""realism,"" but still a great movie. I didn't think I would outlast it, but I found I couldn't shut it off -- I found it rather good. It's a bit long, drawn out and at times tedious, you really have to pay attention to who's who and who's doing what, but, again, it's pretty good.

Knightley wasn't too old or wooden; his hesitancy in the film conveyed the hesitancy that a man in that type of relationship in that period would feel towards a woman of Emma's age (a hesitancy, perhaps even of today). I thought the costumes and interiors were of the period. The absence of servants was too evident, but that's the way Austen writes  -- her characters just glide above the surface of work, not doing it themselves, or hardly supervising it,  whether in the fields, the kitchen, or the house  -- it's all an abstract domestic sphere.

779978,3,6304087969,"This BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's delightful novel of the same title, was a correct and faithful adaptation as far as plot is concerned and quite leisurely, it has six episodes, but all in all it was not quite the thing.

This is mainly due to the actress, playing the main charcter Emma, herself: Doran Godwin. She is not a bad actress but she just couldn't catch Emma's vivacity, energy and liveliness and warm heart - she was too sedate, pretending to be too superior and sometimes she was cold  and .... a tad old to play a 21-year-old young girl. No matter how much I tried I couldn't like her and could not get involved in what would happen to her in the course of the series. Things changed slightly for the better in the latter episodes, she turned into a more positive character, but only because the excellent Fiona Walker as Mrs Elton appeared on scene. She was absolutely brilliant as the vulgar, upstart wife of the vicar Mr Elton, she provoked an instant dislike in the audience with her pretentious ""airs and graces"". It was only opposed to her that Emma seems a more positive character. With her own means, D. Godwin couldn't make it, which is a great pity, for despite her numerous faults Emma IS a very likeable character in the book, just as JA herself intended her to be (and we can see this both in the Beckinsale and Paltrow version).

There were other actors that did not fit the part they were made to play. Ellen Dryden, as Mrs Weston and John Carson as Mr Knightely were way too old for their part and Robert East as Frank Churchill was slimy and his I-have-so-many-teeth smile made me cringe whenever I saw it and it happened quite often.

On the other hand, Donald Eccles as Mr Woodhouse was great, just like Timothy Peters in the role of Mr Elton. Debbie Bowen was a perfect Harriet Smith: pretty, empty-headed but with honest feelings and clearly in great awe of Emma's superiority.

I also liked Ania Marson as Jane Fairfax, however I couldn't understand for the life of me why they had to change her story (Mr Dixon - whom Emma imagines to be in love with Jane - instead of being Ms Campbell's (Jane's close friend) fianc, is a family man who offers Jane a place as governess which she refuses).

The other most important element I missed was the chemistry between Emma and Mr Knightley - which could have given some spice to the film, but as it was non-existent ...

I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.

The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.

I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma.  Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking.  I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed.  She just creeped me out.

Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it.",1149465600,12,914,4.746835443037975

Besides in one scene, poor Miss Bates was about to hit the camera with the back of her head, it was in front of the camera. It seems they didn't think it worth repeating the shoot.

Having said that, it is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Doran Goodwin is not as pretty as Gwyneth Paltrow but she seems sweet at times. The actor playing Mr Knightley may seem too old but I think he was the most attractive man in the film. Still, although he was throwing these glances at Emma I must admit they never looked like lovers to me.

On the plus side there are two very emotional scenes in the film: The first one includes Emma and Mr Knightley. Emma is holding her niece and they have a nice tet&eacute;-a-tet&eacute;. The other is when Emma goes to apologize to Miss Bates.

Mrs. Elton was delightful with her ""caro sposo""s and ""Knightley""s and Mr Woodhouse with all his talk about unhealthy food and winds.",1148860800,6,1213,4.40625
780021,4,6304087969,"EMMA, Jane Austen's most lighthearted novel, is given a lovely treatment by Denis Constanduros.  Doran Godwin gives a delightful performance in the title role and the 6-part series rolls along very well with a faithful eye to the original intent of Austen.

As the story opens, Emma is jubilant over her latest matchmaking effort, having catapulted her beloved governess (Ellen Dryden) down the aisle.  However, her next protege, Harriet Smith (Debbie Bowen) proves to be a little more tricky.  Ever the optimist, Emma seems content in remaining steadfastly single, until her own unlikely love-match makes himself known...

Doran Godwin is the perfect embodiment of Austen's heroine.  The production values are very lavish and the generous running-time (six 45-minute installments) allows the entire story, with all it's delightful characters and intrigues, to chart it's full course.  The support cast includes John Carson, Constance Chapman, Fiona Walker, Donald Eccles, Robert East and Mollie Sugden.",1145232000,11,1003,5.559210526315789
780022,4,6304087969,The production values of this early 1970's BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself.  The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking.  Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation.  Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing.  The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening.  In fact I would have given this five stars if the first episode was as good as the rest.  Well worth spending the money to enjoy this classic adaptation of Emma.,1140393600,9,682,4.786324786324786
780023,1,6304087969,"Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth.",1138492800,12,553,4.431372549019608
780024,2,6304087969,"While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare.  What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh!  It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.

If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version.",1126137600,7,504,4.340425531914893
780025,5,6304087969,"A faithful screen adaptation of the last novel published during Jane Austen's lifetime, this BBC production contains all the wit, irony, and social commentary of the original and sets a new standard for accuracy.  Originally presented as a serialized version of the novel, it is as fully developed and as leisurely as the novel itself, granting viewers ample time (about four hours) to watch the characters unfold, the subtle complexities of the story to be revealed, and this genteel period to come fully alive.  Director John Glenister takes full advantage of the early nineteenth century setting, depicting the elegance of Hartfield, the Woodhouse estate in Highbury, the highly refined and elaborate furnishings of the period, and appropriate costuming.  In varying his settings from room to room at Hartfield, he is able to frame the interactions among characters dramatically, and in showing other houses and buildings within the town, he provides a glimpse of the wider world beyond Highbury.
Emma Woodhouse, the spoiled and somewhat bored twenty-one-year-old daughter of Highbury's leading citizen, amuses herself through her hobby of matchmaking.  Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of ""questionable birth,"" under her wing, she convinces Harriet to reject a farmer who loves her while Emma tries to find her a groom of higher social standing.  A comedy of errors unfolds as the chosen ""groom"" thinks Emma herself is attracted to him, and when rebuffed, marries an abrasive and social-climbing woman who upsets the predictable social life of Highbury.  Emma's other attempts at matchmaking are also misinterpreted, leaving her mystified by the failure of her plans and heartily resented by some of her victims.  As those around her manage to find spouses without her determined help, Emma herself must come to a final understanding of who she is and where she belongs.
Doran Godwin, as Emma, reflects Emma's sense of entitlement,  sacrificing warmth in favor of purposefulness.  Debbie Bowen, as Harriet, is pliable, grateful, and suitably dependent.  Coming to Highbury as the new Mrs. Elton, Fiona Walker provides comic relief as a woman who has, through marriage, entered a level of society to which she is not entitled by birth.  Mr. Knightley, a friend of Emma's father, is a stuffy 37-year-old, one of the few in Highbury able and willing to tell Emma that she is wrong.  Only Ania Marson as Jane Fairfax fails to charm.  Gorgeous, impeccably produced, accurate in reflecting class divisions and social conventions, true to the novel, and brilliantly cast, this production will make a Jane Austen fan of anyone with the patience to appreciate its length and level of detail.

I find it interesting how people used to speak.  Their use of language was, on average, much better than today's.
