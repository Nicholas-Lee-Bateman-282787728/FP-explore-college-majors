8522290,5,B007VQE7IC,This is a great series. The video and sound quality are very good throughout despite the age of the recordings.  I would highly recommend the entire series to anyone who loves jazz.,1431129600,,181,4.65625
8522291,4,B007VQE7IC,"I didn't love all of it, I gave the Monk DVD away, mainly because I'm a drummer and Monk is solo on his footage but others may love it for those reasons.  Great to see Freddie Hubbard Johnny Griffin, I didn't realise how 'jazz/rock' they were in an acoustic genre, exiting stuff.  Art if wonderfull of course though a bit repetitious.  Coltrane is Coltrane, intense an almost spiritual set, great footage of the other band members.  Roland Kirk, interesting as ever.  As usual from Jazz Icon, a mixed set, but generally worth having if your into enough of the content.",1388102400,,568,4.64
