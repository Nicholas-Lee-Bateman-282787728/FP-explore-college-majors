2674103,5,B000JJSKW2,"As this movie opens we find two fighters in battle one with a long halberd style weapon and the other what appears to be an ordinary everyday sword.  But we know that it is so much more than that as its owner states its the Deadly Breaking Sword that upon each battle with an opponent another piece of it gets stuck into the body of his defeated opponent.

The same goes here and it sets the stage for the rest of the movie as the other fighter goes to get treated for this.  By visiting a doctor that has more than a few skeletons in his closet.  He helps him out by pulling out the piece of sword and heals him but he also gains added strength and power.

While there's not a huge amount of fighting going on in the movie.  We do have an excellent secondary character in a thief.  Whom is very skilled with a dagger and comedy relief as well as he helps to lighten the mood throughout the picture with his avarice appetite for money of all types.  It sets the stage for the final battle between the owner of the Sword, the thief and the master of the Halberd (who will look quite a bit different) than we previously saw in the movie.

Still its a great addition to anyone's library of movies and is worthy of watching by anyone with a slight interest in kung-fu.",1210464000,,1264,4.190082644628099
2674104,4,B000JJSKW2,"In 1978-79, director Sun Chung, who noted author Ric Meyers calls the ""David Lean of Hong Kong"", did a successful three picture deal with Shaw Brothers- ""Avenging Eagle"", ""The Kung-Fu Instructor"" & this one. I never saw this one before, and I loved it. One tiny notch below ""Avenging Eagle"", and, no, there is no shortage of martial arts action, expertly choreographed by Tang Chia & Huang Pei-Chi. Great performances by the elegant Ti Lung, comical Fu Sheng, two hotties-Lily Li & Shih Szu, Ku Feng & Chan Hui-Min (who's rarely looked better using a long-handled halberd). Interesting story that deviates from the usual son avenges father, but there is a revenge theme here with a bit of a twist though.

As usual with the Shaws, opulent and ornate sets, and, as usual with Image Entertainment (who I've praised in other reviews), a fantastic job with this DVD treatment; remastered & widescreen picture. There's a choice in audio between Mandarin (with remastered subs) or English (the good, familiar ""Drive-In Movie"" voices). While not as prolific as Chang Cheh or ""The Pops"", creative Sun Chung uses his trademark style which separated him from the rest. If you enjoy Shaw Brothers & old-school fu, then you should get this; I thought it was great.",1204588800,6,1252,4.90566037735849
2674105,4,B000JJSKW2,"This film teams Fu Sheng and Ti Lung with both playing somewhat not so good guy roles the character to watch is the villian who fights with a halbred. The fight between him and Ti Lung early inthis film on a darken street is a classic, Fu Sheng doesn't really do much heavy duty fighting in this film but adds comedy to help the story along. I only gave this film 4 stars because the plot was the build up to this character and Ti Lungs second comfortation with not much action in between all the way to the end. Well worth adding to any serious martial art film collection.",1189382400,8,574,4.2272727272727275
8151334,5,B000JJSKW2,"Great movie and story line.  When I was young, always wanted to watch when it came out, but was too poor to afford to watch at the theater. Now I can watch all I want at Amazon.",1523318400,,177,3.7837837837837838
8151335,4,B000JJSKW2,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  Complicated story, but great sets and very good kung-fu choreography.  Sheng Fu is always an excellent actor and makes movies fun to watch.  In this movie, Sheng Fu is a gambler addict who often loses and ends up owing favors.  He loses to a casino that hires him to be a guard to pay off his debt.  They offer him room and board, and his room is behind a very busy brothel that houses one of the most famous female escorts in town who plays some of the finest music.  Everyone is interested in knowing this escort, including Ti Lung's character who is a kung-fu master who is often challenged by some of the top kung-fu masters in the area.  Ti Lung is master Tuan in the movie and the guy's specialty is that he fights with the deadly breaking sword and he offers each challenger a free coffin as he expects to all be killed.  When his sword stabs someone, the end of it breaks off, leaving the adversary to die.  Most people don't get away except one time a challenger got away with the broken piece of the sword stuck in his shoulder until one day the ""killer doctor"" removes it.  This guy who got away then trained himself to get his revenge against master Tuan.  In the meantime, the escort ask master Tuan to help her take revenge against the killer doctor because he betrayed her brother for the sake of making money off the bounty after the doctor set up her brother and betraying him.  The doctor then sends his goons to try to kill the escort, but the gambler saves her.  The escort then also offers to pay the gambler to kill the doctor as well.  Master Tuan and the gambler become friends during this ordeal.  Soon, everyone fights everyone partly for revenges and partly for money and partly for ranking the highest as a martial artist.",1522195200,,1796,4.416413373860182
8151336,3,B000JJSKW2,Usually enjoy ti lung movies. Unfortunately plays a arrogant semi likeable character. Also alexander fu sheng is this. Hate movies where he's too over the top. Could have been better,1455926400,,182,5.1

8151338,5,B000JJSKW2,Saw this movie on the EL REY network and I had to have it.  Ti Lung and Alexander Fu Sheng are a awesome dynamic duel. There is a english dub for this movie.  Action packed all the way.  I am a big fan of Fu Sheng so I find that all of his movies are awesome.  Never been disappointed with the Shaw brothers movies.  A must have for your collection.,1443571200,,349,3.9285714285714284

8151342,5,B000JJSKW2,"With this line (translated from Mandarin), the two lead characters of ""The Deadly Breaking Sword"" are ultimately defined; each has their own reputation as swordsmen, but regardless of exactly where and how they learned their fighting talents (or how they gained their respective standings in society), they turn out to be equals in more ways than one

The basics of the plot (and the ""signature"" move of Ti Lung's character) have been fairly well established in the other reviews here, and the review by writer Mark Pollard (on the Kung Fu Cinema website) truly catches the essence of what this movie can give to the receptive viewer. Of the three films [Alexander] Fu Sheng made with director Sun Chung, this DVD is the only LEGIT one domestically available.

I sought out this team-up of Fu Sheng and Ti Lung (their second with Chung, after ""Avenging Eagle"", available on DVD as an import or ""bootleg"") because of the significance of the injury Fu Sheng acquired during the making of it. (A wire snapped from a rigging he had on, and he landed on his head, so he likely had a concussion.) This accident, plus the worser calamity that occurred during the production of ""Heroes Shed No Tears"" (a broken leg), would alter his his film career drastically. Judging from the finished film, ""TDBS"" got finished with no complications, and this film is the last time in a Shaw Brothers movie we see the ""vintage"" Fu Sheng in action. After his recovery, he wouldn't regain all his speed and moves, but he came close. (A double--NOT a post-production addition!--handles more tricky moves for Fu Sheng in some of ""TDBS"", but such is the skill of the film editor that it's very hard to pick up where Fu Sheng begins and the double finishes out. More than once, I found myself going, ""Hey! Fu Sheng ACTUALLY did that!"")

My initial look at this pleased me more than I thought it would (in part, because he FINISHED the film), and many ""encores"" have added to my appreciation of this overlooked classic. Exactly how Sun Chung connected every piece of this endearing ""puzzle"" of a film--the story (more than a few holes in the plot, but there IS a beginning, middle and end to this), the acting (the on-screen actors AND the ""voice-over"" actors!), the photography, fight choreography, film editing, music editing (plus the theme song by Jenny, though it's chopped up at the start and finish)--makes it stand out in a way that bigger (expensive and/or longer) films do not always manage to.

If taken out of context from the era in which this originally played overseas (with other martial arts pictures of greater reputations, including the first Jackie Chan ""kung-fu comedies""), this Shaw Brothers production holds its own with any Chang Cheh ""Venoms"" film, as well as anything directed by Lau Kar Leung. Until I get to see early Chan like ""Drunken Master"", any so-called influence his movies had on Fu Sheng's ""Xiao Dao"" role will not phase me; he performs well here, as does Ti Lung, Ku Feng, Chen Hui Min, and Ngai Fei. The ladies don't do any fighting here, but you'll still enjoy the talents of Lily Li (great being Fu Sheng's nemesis), Kara Hui (doesn't do much, but her brief flirting scene with Fu Sheng is cute), and the lovely Shih Szu. (Comparing Szu in ""The Shadow Boxer"" to her part in ""TDBS"", I do see proof she did have plastic surgery at some point!)

The picture on this Image DVD is NOT of ""Tokyo Shock"" quality, but it's very good in its own way. I think the Mandarin language track (with optional English subtitles) adds to the overall sonic ""poetry"" of the movie, while the [unadvertised] English dub detracts from it. Since there are many who prefer the latter, let my opinion on this point be disregarded by THEM, then!...This is a NECESSARY purchase for fans of Fu Sheng (along with ""Heroes Two"" and ""Disciples Of Shaolin""), and followers of Ti Lung, Ku Feng, Lily Li and Shih Szu will need to add this to their collection. Chen Hui Min's performance as the halbred-wielding Lian San is so good, you'll want to see more of his other movies, too!  This is NOT an IMPORTANT Shaw DVD release like ""Come Drink With Me"", ""One-Armed Swordsman"" or ""The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin"", but its value as a work of well-dressed, thoughtful entertainment is not to be second-guessed by anybody. Read Mark Pollard's review, buy the DVD, and become another satisfied purchaser of ""The Deadly Breaking Sword""!

...All the Best, Brother Fang.",1267920000,3,4432,4.740596627756161
