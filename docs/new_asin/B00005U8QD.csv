1664947,4,B00005U8QD,"Well, J.R. Bookwalter does another terrific job making a Non-Sequel to the 1999 Full Moon hit, Witchouse.
With the exceptional work he did on Witchouse 2: Blood Coven, to me, it only seemed appropriate that he do 3.  And thank God for that.
While taking the movie out of the spooky, old mansion scene, he instead places it in a California beach house with 3 hot babes, all best friends, and a Witch names Lilith.
Now, all those, myself included, who think that Ariauna Albright should have reprised her role, really should give Brinke Steven a chance.  I know I didn't in another review I had written.  Brinke takes over for  Ariauna as Lilith.  Though the film does not center around the character of Lilith, it still manages to make a totally screwed up soap opera type movie, with horror elements that blend to make a really great Full Moon/Tempe video production.
The DVD is loaded with extras.  3 commentary tracks, bloopers, outtakes, etc...totally work the money...",1008288000,6,972,4.790419161676646

7954499,4,B00005U8QD,"As a disclaimer, I am not especially a fan of horror or supernatural movies, but I am a fan of Producer/Director J. R. Bookwalter. This film, although titled ""Witchouse 3,"" really shares nothing with the two earlier films sharing the name (other than the presence of a character named Lilith). This time the Witchouse in question is located on a beach, and happens to be inhabited by three very attractive women, who on occasion feel the need to unwind in their swim suits.

The plot concerns inadvertently summoning an evil spirit (despite a seance scene featuring a woman in ""Billy-Bob"" teeth), and generally provides a couple of hours of fun frights if you are a fan of witch movies. Bookwalter has become much more nuanced as a director as he has matured, and the cast has good chemistry. This is a very well made (considering the sub-$30,000 budget, amazingly so) little horror film that supernatural fans should definitely investigate.

The best part of the DVD for me is the extras, which abound. There are bloopers and outtakes, interviews, and three (!) different commentary soundtracks, of which the one featuring Bookwalter is my personal favorite.

If you like witch movies, you will like this one. Good job, J.R.",1117324800,4,1225,4.908212560386473
7954500,5,B00005U8QD,"The original Witchouse was good Full Moon fun...I didn't care for Witchouse 2...and after reading about Witchouse 3: Demon Fire, I wasn't too sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised.
This film, shot for a surprisingly paltry $26,000 is a great little horror flick.
Debbie Rochon, Tanya Dempsey, and Tina Krause play three friends who are being haunted by an unseen figure after doing a mock witchcraft ritual for a documentary.  There's quite the little mystery that ensues and some very eerie and interesting things happen to them.  Turns out it's that sassy Lilith, the wacky witch from the first two movies, back with a vengeance.  The movie does throw a lot of surprises at you...you never really are sure what's going to happen next.  The story holds together cohesively, the acting is superb (it really feels like the three leads have been best buds for years, and they are all very fleshed out characters with their own personalities), and everything snaps along at a very nice pace.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like witch movies (this is MUCH better than ""The Craft""), or just horror in general.  The gore is kind of light in this one, but everything else in the movie more than makes up for that.
The DVD offers a few nice extras too (including widescreen and Dolby 5.1 surround sound)...it's a very good deal!  Enjoy!",1014508800,12,1352,4.776824034334764
