8363854,5,B002CAWNG0,The Best anime movie DVD ever!!! Thanks so much!!,1474761600,,49,4.555555555555555
8363855,4,B002CAWNG0,I have the vol one dvd of the 1963 astro boy which was obviously not color. The year for the color dvd episodes is wrong but I really enjoyed watching vol 1. I am planning to get the other 4 volumes. It is a matter of opinion. Some may hate the color versions and others may love them. The animation is much improved but taking into account that the '63 shows were the original anime they are fun to watch. I was born in 1963 but still remember reruns of these when I was a little older. The quality of the dvds for both versions is top rate. I recommend any of them to anime fans especially if you love astro boy.,1271635200,,614,4.040983606557377
8363856,3,B002CAWNG0,"I have to say the Product Title ""Astro Boy, Vol. 1 (1963)"" is misleading.
This DVD is Episodes 1-10 of ""the all-new ASTRO BOY, a modern update ...""
This is evidently the 2004 version.

I'm not interested in that; didn't watch it.
I don't like putting a rating on something I haven't seen,
but I also would like other customers to know what they are getting so I have to choose some rating.
I picked a neutral 3 stars.",1256083200,8,417,4.2784810126582276
