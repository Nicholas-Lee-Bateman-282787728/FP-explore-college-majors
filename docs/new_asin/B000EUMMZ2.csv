2537033,5,B000EUMMZ2,"The five stars are for the show, which I'm very pleased to see FINALLY available, even if only in part, after all this time.  For some reason, the network seemed intent on killing it - three episodes to start, several months of hiatus, a few more episodes (with no preparation or explanation - a show of this complexity definitely needed to bring new viewers up to speed!) and then ... nothing.  I was crushed when it died and have been raving about it to friends ever since.

Intelligent, articulate writing, complex characters portrayed by brilliant actors, stunning cinematography: this show has it all.  Paul Haggis must have known what was going to happen, though - Icarus, indeed.  Okay, he did fly too close to the sun - but they took a blow-torch to his wings.

Watch what you can now, and lobby for the rest.  Trust me, you won't regret it.",1147392000,4,849,4.582781456953643
2537034,3,B000EUMMZ2,"i absolutely loved this show and often list it among my favorites of all time. that being said, i'll stick with my video copies until a complete set of all the episodes is available on dvd",1147132800,12,188,4.25
2537035,3,B000EUMMZ2,"This was a great show that CBS messed with and then cancelled way too early.  It was on in October, and it was off.  It was on in March, and it was off.  It was on in April, etc.  CBS didn't even show the last episode, instead replacing it with an episode of Walker Texas Ranger at the last minute.  At first I was glad to see it coming out on dvd and ordered it right away.  Much to my chagrin though, I then saw that it only had 3 or 4 episodes instead of the whole 10.  Bravo, come on, release the entire series.  Don't cancel the Brilliant but Cancelled series by only releasing a few episodes.

Excited, and then disappointed, Mr. Pibb in Michigan",1144281600,22,652,4.111111111111111
2537036,5,B000EUMMZ2,"This is one of the times hwen a critic's suggestion pays off. I remember reading about this series and then taping the first few episodes. I can't recall much about the plot except that there was alot of grey area between good guys and bad. Ken Olin did a nice job in one of his first roles after Thrity Something and Joe Pantoliano plays his usaul superlative creep. Look,if quality Tv was appreciated we'd still be seeing new episodes of St. Elsewhere. This is definitely worth a look, I'm getting mine.",1143504000,4,505,4.56043956043956
2537057,3,B000EUMMZ2,"It was actually too painful to order this product when I found it was so incomplete.  I watched the entire series, including the last, un-aired, episode over a few week period, by going to the Museum of Television and Radio (now called ""The Paley Center for Media"") in Beverly Hills, CA, and watching a couple each weekend.  There is another branch in New York.

The museum has a viewing library where you can go and watch not only these episodes, and many historic episodes of other great series, but they also have recorded interviews with the cast and creator of this show.  The series still ended too abruptly, but did resolve a few loose ends.  Perhaps order these episodes, and plan to watch the rest in California or New York.",1355702400,2,733,4.607692307692307
2537058,3,B000EUMMZ2,"This was a great series that CBS cancelled before the last episode was shown so left fans hanging, not knowing the wrap up of the whole mystery they had been watching all season. I had always wanted to see the series again and get the ending. What I didn't realize when I bought it, was there are only 3 episodes on this CD- the pilot and 2 others. So again, no ending. It is more of a tease to get you to go to Bravo's site to watch the whole thing. Great show but disappointing that you can't get the whole series on DVD.",1329436800,,523,4.038461538461538
2537059,3,B000EUMMZ2,"Well, maybe the Network execs aren't such dunderheads as reported so often.
The 'Brilliant But Canceled' is a good marketing ploy, maybe aimed at movie
mavericks. But just clever hype.

Three episodes. Number one, very good in all aspects. Episode two, deduct
a star; Episode three, deduct another star. There must have been focus groups
reflecting the diminishing returns. Tension was vague, the plot meandered,
and never resolved in the first three shows. Wish it wasn't so; with such
participants I expected much more.

Haggis is a many-talented pro. Whatever soured EZ Streets (a deceptive title
for such a grim, lifeless show), I expect it was mostly the writing; performances
were fine; but sort of lethargic. The entire story just was so dark and sad, no
body won; not cops, trapped good people, sociopathic bad guys nor noble passerby's.",1320105600,,845,5.071942446043166
2537060,2,B000EUMMZ2,"The show's a gritty drama that has been compared with ""The Wire"". It's full of beautiful, celtic music, predominately from Loreena McKennit. If you want to know more about it, look it up on IMDb or Wikipedia. :)

The point I want to make is about the DVD itself. I have only seen the first six episodes, so I was thrilled to get the DVD, thinking it would contain the whole series - all nine episodes. As I found out when I got the DVD, it only contains THREE episodes: the pilot episode, ""Every Dog Has Its Day"" (ep. 5) and ""One Acquainted with the Night"" (ep. 6). If you're a fan of any of the actors (I got it because of Ken Olin), okay, you'll get to see them a bit. If you want to watch the whole series, though, no luck. If I had known the DVD only came with three episodes on, I wouldn't have bothered.",1306886400,3,809,4.088050314465409
2537061,5,B000EUMMZ2,"If I didn't love this show that I never heard of before - I'd drop 2 stars because it should be the whole series but...it really is a 5 star show.

I've hesitated on trying this out because who wants a few episodes of anything?  But I finally broke down since it's so cheap and decided a few good hours of TV (if it's any good) would be worth it.  Now I watched them all in one night which I don't usually do and I'm so disappointed that there's no more episodes.

TV Powers that be are just as stupid about DVD releases as they are about creating, marketing, and cancelling great shows. There are more cancelled shows on DVD that have turned out to be excellent TV watching than there are TV shows that air for years and are worth watching. Perhaps if you market a shows and then leave it in a time slot and actually air it with weeks of interruption-some of these shows would have lasted like they should have.

A few episodes of some great shows, the first season and then  nothing or the first 2 season and then years go by before anything else comes out.  Then the great shows of the past and not so distant past that never get released- where's the logic?

Every season it seems the great shows are cancelled because they are too interesting?  too complicated? Too different? and the PTB just don't get it meanwhile, the junk that all looks the same, has all the same type characters come back for another season.  With exceptions of course.

I'm glad I bought, now I have yet another show to hope for a full release in the future.",1236729600,4,1537,4.302083333333333
2537062,1,B000EUMMZ2,I loved this show when it originally aired and I would have really enjoyed to watch it again. In its entirety! Why would I buy a release that only includes some sample episodes? What moron had the asinine idea to release a half baked DVD like this one? I can't begin to describe how disappointed I am. Somebody else please release this (I mean all of it) soon!,1236384000,2,360,4.3088235294117645
2537063,1,B000EUMMZ2,"A fantastic show? Yes. But as others have noted, what in the world is the point to releasing THREE of NINE episodes (counting the double-length pilot as one episode)? Not only is it one-third of the total that rabid fans want, but it's actually episodes 1, 5, and 6 instead of 1, 2, and 3! Is it any wonder consumers are so angry at the studios over how they release their content? If you buy this consider yourself warned. This disc is nothing but a tease. If you insist on being frustrated just rent it from Netflix. That way every time you see the disc one your shelf you won't feel like an idiot for having bought it knowing that you're getting a small hodgepodge of a great show.

The show may be ""Brilliant but Cancelled,"" but Bravo is ""Wrong-headed and Absurd.""",1172534400,5,768,4.408450704225352
2537064,2,B000EUMMZ2,"I like EZ Streets. It was gritty, It was complex and it had a soul that many crime shows  never had. Suddenly, as it come on TV... it was canceled  after eight episodes (here is only three episodes outta eight!).

Written and created by Oscar Winner (for Crash) Paul Haggis, someone should tell Universal  DVD division-if you say something is BRILLANT , Show me all the episodes! I agree it was, not let me have it!

I will give it FIVE stars when there is a FULL collection of EZ Streets...Otherwise I leave the review at TWO stars

2537065,5,B000EUMMZ2,"EZ Streets foreshadowed the wave of complex dramas on HBO, TBS, Fox and others. For those who saw EZ Streets, HBO's Sopranos was derivative and less satisfying. Unfortunately, CBS didn't know what it had or how to build a show that requires rapt attention or a means to catch-up on what went before. The revenue lost by not having a complete story to sell on DVD (after the example of 24 and others) is staggering.

Creator Paul Haggis went on to movie acclaim (Million Dollar Baby and Crash), but EZ Streets was a pinnacle of imagination and execution that is still unmatched on network or cable television. From the casting and acting, to use of music, through compelling cinematography, to a dark, layered and complex storyline, EZ Streets is as good as I have ever seen. After ten years it is still fresh in my mind and the touchstone; it is my all time favorite television series. I still want to ""follow the keys,"" the one lead left for Ken Olin's Detective Quinn to follow.

The EZ Streets ensemble members are largely dramatic leads and stars now or behind the camera applying lessons learned. It is a measure of the quality of the cast how many have thrived since EZ Streets' short life. I see John Finn on Cold Case and hear Captain Geary's standard parting, ""I've got a thing."" I still wonder, on which side of the law was Geary? Joe Pantoliano aka Joey Pants moved from character actor to lead as the small time hood Jimmy Murtha. Carl Lumbly was back in a similarly complex story in Alias, but he was first a beautifully corrupt and manipulated mayor in EZ Streets. Ken Olin directed almost a quarter of the Alias episodes. He learned from EZ Streets how to tell a long story arc with cliffhanger episodes (and learned the hard way the need for a weekly recap). This was one of the last roles for Rod Steiger as Quinn's disgraced and broken down father. There are more, like Debrah Farentino's sexy and smart Theresa Conners, Mike Starr's big presence, and Sarah Trigger as a fragile, breaking, drug addled and desperate mother. I regularly see actors that first caught my eye here. Mark Isham's haunting theme music must also be credited.

Quality through and through, EZ Streets is a stunning achievement. The quality made it all the more heartbreaking that the cast and crew were never allowed to finish the story.

EZ Streets became the definition of ""brilliant but cancelled."" Like CBS with the show, the DVD is overly stingy, offering only three episodes of the nine filmed. The logic of the DVD offering is especially strange since the target audiences (rabid fans of EZ Streets and Haggis) know darn well what they are missing. I'd pay more for a full collection on DVD. I'd pay a fortune to know the never filmed end of the story.",1168819200,7,2752,4.633196721311475
2537066,5,B000EUMMZ2,"EZ Street goes without saying it is by far one of the best cancelled shows out there, but buyer beware. You do NOT get the full series.",1168473600,5,135,4.037037037037037
2537087,5,B000EUMMZ2,"With the only exceptions of Homicide: life on the street and The Wire, EZ Streets is quite simply the greatest program ever produced for television! Paul Haggis and Robert Moresco have crafted a brilliant morality tale set in a defeated Northern Midwest Rust Belt metropolis. The cast which includes Ken Olin, Jason Gedrick, Joe Pantoliano, Debra Farentino, Richard Portnow, John Finn, Mike Starr, R. D. Call and Carl Lumbly is first rate. This exceptional show was cancelled for good after just nine episodes, entirely too soon! Fortunately, the episodes were initially resurrected by Trio's Brilliant But Cancelled and assembled in part on this DVD. Aside from a lack of bonus supplemental features, my only criticism of this DVD is that it does not include all nine hours. Featured among its contents are the groundbreaking pilot and two subsequent episodes. I highly recommend this show and this DVD to those who enjoy challenging, serialized and thoroughly riveting crime drama!",1154304000,3,983,5.227848101265823

2537089,5,B000EUMMZ2,"Paula Haggis' ""EZ Streets"" was a drama far ahead of its time, and despite the best efforts of Les Moonves (who cancelled it not once but twice) has finally reached its fans 10 years after being broadcast. The series had an extraordinary cast, particularly Joe Pantolianao as the sadistic Jimmy Murtha, Ken Olin as devoted almost to the point of fanatical cop Cam Quinn, and a pre-""Boomtown"" Jason Geddrick as the sweet but clueless loser Danny. Backed up by excellent co-stars like veteran character actor Mike Starr, Sarah Trigger as Danny's wife Ellie, and Deborah Farantino as a twisted man-eating lawyer, this series keeps you glued to the screen, laughing and crying at the stories of three men whose lives are intertwined, for good or ill, since childhood. Also of note is Haggis' use of music. If you fall in love with the pilot, be sure and check out cellist Caroline Lavelle's haunting recording of ""Moorlough Shores"". Also featured on this first disc are Maire Brennan and Loreena McKennitt.",1149292800,12,1001,4.928994082840236

2537093,3,B000EUMMZ2,"I really, really liked this series, and wouldn't even watch CBS for quite a while afterwards because they kept on cancelling great shows (every show that was any good, they cancelled).  I was really excited to see it came out on DVD, pre-ordered it, and was looking forward to seeing the series again, especially the unaired episode.  I guess they knew if they mentioned that is was only a handful of episodes, not as many people would buy it.

For those interested in purchasing it, the episodes included are:

 EZ Streets Pilot

 Every Dog has its Day

 One Acquainted with the Night

The case lists the running time as 3 hours, 2 minutes (way too little for a show this good!)

This is the last time I will pre-order from the ""Brilliant but Cancelled"" series, unless, of course, they are up front about how little they are really offering.  I guess the only way it's safe to buy anything from their series is to wait and see what's missing - which will evidently only be available from reviews that people make after they buy it and are disappointed.",1148601600,18,1053,4.542553191489362
2537094,5,B000EUMMZ2,"I loved this show from the moment it aired. When I saw it was coming out on DVD I rushed to get my pre-order in. What a huge disappointment it only has 3 episodes, huh? Where's the rest. I really wouldn't have purchased it if I knew I wasn't getting the full short season it was. I was interrupted during one really important scene and had told all my friends how much I couldn't wait to finally see it. Guess not since it was close to the end of the 8 episodes.

2537096,3,B000EUMMZ2,"EZ Streets is one of the very best TV shows most people have never seen. Great writing, great casting, great story, great scoring, great critical raves. Great god, what must the network have been thinking to have cancelled it after barely putting it on in the first place. Well EZ Streets creator Paul Haggis finally found the acclaim this show should have won him from the masses when he wrote the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" and then wrote and directed this year's ""Crash"". That's not much recompense to those of us who loved THIS show, though.

So why just three stars? Because this isn't the entire series. This is just 5 episodes. It's not even clear WHICH 5 episodes. This not ""Volume 1"" or anything, so I'm guessing this is all you're gonna get, and that's just not enough. Especially since there were only 8 episodes aired (one the two hour pilot) AND (are you listening boys and girls?) a 9th episode (""Neither Have I Wings to Fly"") which was NEVER AIRED in the US...No love for those of us who loved this show in it's much too brief time?",1147824000,36,1057,4.534031413612565

The show itself isn't bad, though I wouldn't give it the heady praise other reviewers did; I would call it better than average but not great, and I probably would have been happy to watch more episodes without complaining.

Bad enough that the series died before its time, but to do worse damage is irresponsible and suicidal to sales.
