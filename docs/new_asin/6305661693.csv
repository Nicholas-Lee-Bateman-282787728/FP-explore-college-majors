1063880,4,6305661693,"This video doesn't have any of the soothing music, beautiful scenery, and other ""bells and whistles"" yoga tapes normally have. It's a very simply put together video, but I found the husband and wife team very pleasing. The husband talks and the wife demonstrates, and I find the husband to be very soothing and very positive. On days when I just feel achy and blue, this video cheers me up and I always sleep better after doing it. As a beginner with Yoga, I felt this was a great introduction into the moves and breathing.",1013126400,,523,4.515789473684211
1063881,3,6305661693,"If you are a physically active person or have ever taken a yoga class, this tape isn't for you.  Even in pregancy I wanted more.  But, if you are a beginner, this tape may be just right.  In general, the postures are good.  But there is no soothing music or silence.  You hear talking throughout.  I often did the poses with the TV muted and my own music playing.  And don't expect to work up a sweat or hold the poses long enough.  I would often have the remote control close by to pause the tape so I could feel the stretches equally on each side.  Despite all of this, I would use the tape about 3 times a week in my last trimester, mostly to quiet my mind and get back in focus.",994032000,12,682,4.029850746268656
1063882,2,6305661693,"I have been practicing yoga for about a year and I have tried a number of different yoga videos. I have enjoyed most of them and and am still learning. My sister is pregnant and I wanted her to be able to enjoy some of the benefits I have received from practicing yoga, especially since she is have a difficult pregnancy. I bought  this video for her after reading many of the reviews and thinking that it might help her attain some focus and a sense of peace. After giving her the video, I waitied for her to call and tell me how much she was enjoying the video. The call never came. So upon my next visit to her house, I watched the video. While the husband explained the poses and the purpose of them very clearly, and the wife demonstrated them, overall I was extremely disappointed.  The man NEVER stopped talking, there is NO soothing music and the background is very boring. (Looks like their house or something). Instead of relaxing me, it aggravated me and made me shut it off in the middle of the video. So, I asked my sister what she thought and she felt the same way.  I have  Kathy Smith's New Yoga  video, Yoga Journal's AM/PM yoga, Yoga Journals - Yoga Practice (set of 3) and Yoga Journal's Practice for Beginners. I enjoy all of these videos. I am going to continue try to find another video, one for pregant women for my sister.",986083200,36,1346,4.346613545816733
1063883,1,6305661693,"I did this tape once and haven't wanted to do it again.  I really like the yogazone segments on the Health Network, but this was disappointing.  I didn't like many of the poses. Several of them bothered me or weren't doable / rewarding for me. Also it was generally boring, no music or nice backdrop. The delivery of the instructor just didn't captivate me like the instructors on the TV show.  I really liked the TV yogazone instructors and format, but this nothing like that.",983836800,10,477,4.588235294117647
1063884,1,6305661693,THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO BE REALLY TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET. FIRST IF YOU CAN GET PASS THE ANNOYING GUY YOUR DOING GOOD. THEN HIS WIFE EVEN LOOKS LIKE SHE WANT'S TO TELL HIM TO SHUT UP A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME. IT JUST ANNOYED ME THE WHOLE TIME. EVERYTIME SHE MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT POSITION HE WOULD TALK AND TALK AND TALK WHILE SHE WAS JUST BENT IN THESE POSITIONS AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE'S NOTICING THAT BEING IN THESE POSITIONS IN A LONG TIME WOULD START TO HURT BUT HE'S MORE INTO WHAT HE'S SAYING. PLEASE TAKE THIS VIDEO OFF THE SHELF! OR THROW IT IN THE TRASH THAT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE!!,983232000,6,632,4.023809523809524
1063885,5,6305661693,"I'm almost at the end of my 6th month of pregnancy, and I do this workout at least 2 times a week. I always feel so relaxed afterwards, and the stretches have been really good for my back and legs. I do always play my own music, as there isn't any provided on the tape, but I almost prefer that--I tend to get tired of the music on exercise tapes before I tire of the routines. The approach is simple and matter-of-fact, with clear instructions. Some of the streches are so helpful I find myself doing them when my back hurts. I have yet to learn how this will help me with labor, but I know the relaxation and focusing exercises can only benefit me.",974073600,,650,4.208
1063886,5,6305661693,"I absolutely loved this tape!  Every day I looked forward to doing yoga because of it.  I was never really that good at yoga before I was pregnant, but with the added flexibility from pregnancy and the great video, I felt very confident.  I still do yoga to other Yoga Zone tapes, but I miss this one.  My only recommendations would be to buy some music (because it doesn't have any), and do the tape every day!  Did I say that it helped with labor -- that was a plus!",972000000,10,468,4.155555555555556
1063887,4,6305661693,"I've been using this video for a month.  I find it very energizing, and I look forward to the feeling of calm I have by the end.  It's a manageable length of time.  I'm not terribly flexible, but I find the postures  manageable.  My one issue is that I have a bad back.  A couple of the  postures were irritating my back in the tailbone region.  However, I just  stopped doing those postures and I've been fine.  Something I would have  liked is more direction about postures that could be helpful in labour.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable video, and I recommend it, especially to  beginners.",940809600,19,596,4.457943925233645
1063930,1,6305661693,"I had heard really good things about Yoga Zone, so it was with a high degree of anticipation that i popped the video to watch. The narrator blathers on and on, while his wife acts like a Stepford Wife, exclaiming as non-sequiturs how well she feels.  When you're done with the tape the first thing you feel is mental fatigue.  This video cannot be watched more than twice (I tried).  He seems to be a nag and she seems to be brainless.",1122249600,3,435,4.280487804878049
1063931,5,6305661693,"I have been doing Yoga Zone for over a year now. I stopped when I got pregnant, so I switched over to this DVD. Not only do I love the extra postures that I didn't learn in the other tapes, it still incorporates some that I already know, and didn't know I could do them being pregnant! My only critique is that it sort of rushes through some of the postures, I find I have to pause the DVD to finish. But I practice the moves when I'm not watching, so that's OK.",1097107200,,462,3.978494623655914
1063932,1,6305661693,"The workout on this DVD may be decent, but I just can't get past the creepy husband/host. The setting is cheap looking and it is poorly filmed. For a much better pregnancy workout, I prefer FitMama.",1092009600,2,198,4.527777777777778
1063933,1,6305661693,"I wish I would have known about all the different prenatal Yoga videos out there!  There has definately got to be something better than this.  As it is, this was the only one my local video store had.  I was six months pregnant when I watched it.  I kept waiting for the instructor to stop talking so I could enjoy the poses and have a relaxing workout.  Oh no, he talks constantly the whole 50 minutes of the video, explaining in excrutiating detail all the poses.  He spends so much time explaining the poses...and then they're only held for seconds before moving on to the next one.  So most of the time I was not doing anything because I was waiting for him to finish explaining the next pose, and I just wanted him to show it already so I could do it!  Don't waste your time or money.",1051747200,13,789,4.248322147651007
1063934,5,6305661693,"I got this DVD as a gift and was a bit surprised and disappointed when I realized that it was the husband explaining all the moves while his wife demonstrated. I mean, we're supposed to get advice from other women, right? However, I gave it a go and tried it a couple of times.
I have to admit that the techniques (or postures) in this video have helped me the most. It's not a yoga workout. It's simply different postures that you can get into to help relieve some of the pressures on your changing body. I find that I use it more as stretching ideas than an actual workout.
I also miss it when I don't do it - my body starts to feel more constricted and uncomfortable.
Again, this is NOT a workout video. For that, I'd suggest Rocki's Prenatal Yoga video. This one contains different poses and detailed information on how to do the pose properly. Most of the different poses are accompanied by a reason for the pose - i.e. This one relieves the neck and shoulders, this one helps with tension in the back of the legs, etc. So that after you've done the video a couple of times, you quickly pick up on the different poses you can do when you only have time for a momentary release. For instance, your lower back is hurting, so take a moment to stand against the wall and slide down into a squatting position. Then get up and continue on with what you're doing. (Although your office mates may think you're a bit odd, they tend to excuse any weird actions during pregnancy.)",1046390400,42,1474,4.344202898550725
1063935,2,6305661693,"We own another Yoga Zone DVD, and it is great, so naturally I bought this one when my wife got pregnant.  This is NOT the same format as the other Yoga Zone DVD.  It is a guy (and his 8-month pregnant wife as a model) advising you the different positions.  There is no background music, and the poses are held for long periods of time while the guy explains correct form.
We were not interested in ""performing"" or getting the forms exactly right, but rather light exercise that was safe and easy to do.  This video is more for someone with extensive Yoga experience.",1041984000,13,566,4.413461538461538
1063936,3,6305661693,I found this video to be easy to follow. It included postures that were easy for a beginner and more advanced poses. I would recommend this video to someone who has some yoga experience.,1041811200,4,186,4.5
1063937,4,6305661693,"I bought three Yoga tapes for pregnancy - this was the only one I could stand doing.  I was a daily yoga practitioner before I got pregnant, and then became a weekly class goer after I got pregnant, so I bought this tape to maintain my abilities.  I found the discussion helpful and the poses were very good for me.  They helped me work on flexibility (one can always hold longer than the video by using the pause button) and the routine was quite nice.  I thought this one was much better than the Crunch Yoga Mamma (do not buy) and the Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea (which I did not enjoy).",1037750400,10,589,4.232142857142857
1063938,1,6305661693,"I would not know how to rate the DVD, since I never recieved it. I placed a order on June 13th and am still waiting its arrival. I have placed several phone calls to this company called ""orderbox.com ""and  quite a few emails and no on has ever bothered to return them. I did however receive the bill for this item. ..",1027555200,3,317,4.112903225806452
1063939,4,6305661693,"I don't know a thing about yoga.  I always wanted to try it but never actually went to a class.  I am currently 32 weeks (a little over 7 months) pregnant and I got this DVD to relieve some stress and relax a little, not to mention keep my body in some sort of shape, in the comfort of my own home.  It wasn't too difficult for me (someone with virtually no flexablity), everything was explained as far as what each thing does for your pregnant body and I nearly fell asleep in the end when he does the relaxation technique.  Relaxing is not my forte so anyone who can get my mind to focus deserves my praise!  In short, good for beginners.  Made me feel great.",1026691200,22,661,4.165354330708661

7893542,4,6305661693,"I have done some yoga over the years. Mostly, I would practice yoga zone's ""Introduction to Yoga."" Now that I'm pregnant, just beginning my six month, I'm grateful to have this video! It helps me to relax and eases the hip pain I've been experiencing at night. I also feel that it is helping me to maintain strength and flexibility as I progress through my pregnancy. My only complaint would be that I wish some of the poses were held longer! So I just pause it and hold them longer and breathe through them to my heart's content. It's not a ""workout"" but it is a stretching, strengthening, de-stressing program that has been excellent for my pregnancy.",1340755200,,653,4.589743589743589
7893543,5,6305661693,"I am honestly surprised at all the bad reviews of this video.  I am 6 months pregnant and have been having some low back pain.  I started to feel relief immediately after using the video one time (I now use it at least 3 times a week).  Yes the DVD is a little old and his accent is kind of funny, but it really has helped me relieve stress and feel calmer.  I always love how I feel after doing this yoga DVD.  I like how he focuses on doing the poses in the correct form, because it is the MOST important part of yoga. This is not for someone looking for a tough workout, this is for someone looking to strech your body, relax and relieve some pressures brought on by pregnancy.",1324339200,,680,4.082706766917293
7893544,5,6305661693,"I got this DVD at the beginning of my 1st pregnancy and used it quite often through all of them. It really helped with my sore back and legs, was an easy work-out when I didn't have the energy to really work out hard, and the relaxation part at the end left me so relaxed, I sometimes fell asleep while doing it. I ordered a second DVD for a friend, whom I had let borrow the DVD during one of her pregnancies (and also LOVED it), then she became pregnant again at the same time I was, and I didn't want to part with it. While I still do arobic pregnancy workouts often, on days when I'm feeling sore or just need a light, relaxing workout, I still use this one.",1243987200,,662,4.061068702290076
7893545,4,6305661693,"This product is not for people new to yoga.  Alan Finger is an experienced yogi who tries to make sure you get the most out of each pose, so each pose is very carefully explained.  The poses felt great for my entire back and my hamstrings.  I would definitely recommend this to a pregnant friend.  It is not really a ""workout"", but more of a relaxation and stretching program.",1234483200,,376,4.405797101449275
7893546,1,6305661693,"This would be good for someone who has never taken yoga before. I was slightly put off that a man was talking all about the poses that are beneficial to a woman's body during pregnancy and delivery. I doubt he has ever been pregnant so I find it hard to relate to. Plus there is no real flow, it does not feel like a full practice but rather how to do some basic poses. There were one or two poses that felt pretty good, but they are basic moves that you would probably find in any other dvd.",1178668800,,492,4.030612244897959
7893547,5,6305661693,"I know the host can be a bit long winded at times, I agree with that. But for me the proof is in the pudding, I feel SO much better for the two days after I have done this DVD. What I find is, while it is old, and it is not fancy with a beautiful resort background, it does what it needs to do, and that is tell me how to propperly do poses in order to stretch out my body and prepare myself for childbirth. I love and admire Yoga Zone's attention to detail when describing a pose, right down to something as simple as how you have your hand turned that makes a surprising difference in how the pose is felt. I never feel pressure to push myself deeper than my body should go into a pose. The other Yoga DVD I purchased was quite frankly terrible, I don't even know if I could truly call it yoga as it seemed to lack any of the poses that truly did my body good. It actually left me feeling worse, as if I had done something to knock myself out of alignment.  I trust Yoga Zone to have well researched videos that include poses that are safe and beneficial. I do not need to be told by a yoga DVD to envision myself ""squatting in a forest and giving birth to my child in another country"" (and I am not joking, the other DVD actually said that) What I need is a yoga DVD that makes my body feel better and helps release the stress and tension of carrying a baby, and this DVD does that for me.",1170288000,,1392,3.9714285714285715
7893548,1,6305661693,"A friend loaned this to me and I didn't realize at first that it is a man guiding, because the picture on the front is of a pregnant woman in a posture. I can't believe the chutzpah of this man, telling us what postures are best for pregnancy and what feels the most balanced, etc. At one point he even says something like, ""This posture is the best for feeling centered in your body and makes it MUCH easier to push the baby out during labor"". And he says it with such authority... how would he know that?!!  I'm sure there is no shortage of wonderful, female, yoga teachers who have had children and can speak about these things with true authority. Yoga Zone should find one - it would give their product a lot more credibility. Ladies, please don't insult yourselves by giving your attention and money to yet another man who claims to be able to inform you of the best ways to prepare for childbirth and to give birth. As far as the postures themselves go, they are just very basic yoga postures - nothing out of the ordinary. He does go much too fast for my taste.",1166659200,2,1069,4.318407960199005
7893549,3,6305661693,"I am a longtime fan of Yoga Zone products, so when I received the pregnancy video, I was a bit disappointed to find that it wasn't to the caliber of the Yoga Zone Videos I am used to.  It was obviously a low-budget film, and probably filmed some time in the early 80's (the gray headed yoga master Alan Finger actually has brown hair in this video!)in what looks to be the couples home.  Having said this, the instruction on form is very good, as it always is with Yoga Zone, especially for 1st timers to yoga.  Yoga Zone, please make an update!!",1145491200,,546,4.281553398058253
7893550,5,6305661693,"I used this DVD and ZenMama almost daily toward the end of my pregnany.  Since I was new at yoga, it was really helpful to have Alan give specific directions about form.
