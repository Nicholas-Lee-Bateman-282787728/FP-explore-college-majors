4465081,5,B004T1RAWW,"It is the best live performance that I have seen. The Stylistics were on point. I loved it!!. It was like they never aged. The lead singer had to actually love the former lead singer, because he really sound just like him. Great DVD that everyone that love the Stylistics should have in their collection...",1485302400,2,306,4.581818181818182
4465082,5,B004T1RAWW,"I watched this DVD at a friends house, not expecting anything more than the typical oldies group performance. However, I was extremely surprised!
I felt like I was in a time tunnel, traveling back to the '70's watching The Stylistics perform. Their choreography was flawless as were their voices. The gentleman who sings Russell Thompkins Jr.'s, parts, is spot on. If you close your eyes, if a little hard to tell it's not Russell. All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend this purchase. By the way when I got home I purchased a copy for myself on Amazon also! Enjoy!",1483660800,,571,4.72

4465093,4,B004T1RAWW,"Good show!  All the hits are here and the singers and the band sound great.  I know the lead singer is too young to be the original guy, so I'm wondering where they found a new guy who sounds JUST like the old guy and sings the songs exactly like the original records.

8440411,3,B004T1RAWW,I love the Stylistics BUT I was very disappointed with the quality of this DVD. Weird camera angle from the side of the auditorium.
