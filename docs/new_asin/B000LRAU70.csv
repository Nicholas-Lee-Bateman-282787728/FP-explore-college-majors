8163802,5,B000LRAU70,"I enjoyed this classic documentary DVD on MMA Legend, Randy ""The Natural"" Couture. It shows his determination and preparation to convert himself from a world-class amateur wrestler to become one of the greatest UFC champion fighters. It also shows Randy riding horses and working hard around his home. His daughter speaks about Randy as a loving and caring father.  It also covers a female fighter, Victoria Schiltz, which shows her MMA talents. She is definitely a pioneer in the woman's MMA world. This DVD has amazing fighting and training footage of Randy Couture which prompted me to buy this documentary. However, anything on Randy Couture is worth buying. This is a great DVD to add to your collection if you like MMAs.",1393200000,,726,4.950819672131147

8163805,5,B000LRAU70,"I'm a huge MMA fan who has followed the sport since the 1990s. This DVD really captures the dedication and determination of the athletes who were involved in MMA before it became so popular in recent years. The amazing footage of Randy Couture will probably be what prompts most people to buy this documentary, but the director also filmed a lot of riveting material with the amateur MMA fighters as well. The hair stood up on my arms a few times when the fighters were speaking of their personal experiences in the cage and about their philosophies in regards to fighting. This DVD is a ""must-have"" for any true fan of the sport, particularly those who have watched MMA for a long time.

8163806,5,B000LRAU70,"Well first of all me and all my friends are fans and collectors of anything to do with MMA. That being said, I know at least four people who bought the dvd of POTENT and none of them had any problems with the playback of the dvd. The audio and visual were perfect. I think it was the most intense and informative documentary about MMA I have seen. (I liked 'smashing machine' but it's a documentary more about a drug abuse.) This documentary was only and purely about MMA. Potent was  what I have been waiting for , for a long time. I talk so highly of this documentary since I actually used some of the strategies in potent to help me win my last amateur MMA fight. So besides the great advice from all the fighters, the photograghy was awesome! great movie! (btw my friend who just watched my copy of potent says he agrees with me and loved the footage :) )",1204761600,,859,4.237804878048781
8163807,5,B000LRAU70,"A great addition to any MMA library. This is THE classic MMA story of Randy Couture's preparation to convert himself from a world-class amateur wrestler to a UFC competitor under the coaching of former Iowa Hawkeye wrestler and MMA trainer, Rico Chiaparelli. Also, a section about female fighter, Victoria Schiltz, shows how even normal people somehow get into this sport. She was definitely a pioneer in woman's MMA. The last part about the 2 newbies to the cage is a reflection of how new and unorganized the sport was 10 years ago. Two Thumbs Up!",1167955200,5,549,4.7894736842105265
8163808,5,B000LRAU70,"THIS WAS A VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER PIECE ABOUT WHAT REALLY GOES ON IN THE LIFE OF A MMA (MIXED MARTIAL ARTS) FIGHTER. I FELT FOR ABOUT $30 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER AND COULD HAVE HAD SOME MORE FIGHT SEQUENCES, BUT ALL IN ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL PRODUCED, TOLD A GOOD STORY FROM A UNIQUE POINT OF VIEW, AND IF NOTHING ELSE IT STARS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FIGHTERS, RANDY ""THE NATURAL"" COUTURE. A DEFINATE MUST OWN FOR ANY TRUE MMA FAN . BUT THAT IS ONLY ONE GUYS OPINION.",1167868800,2,492,4.030612244897959
