8360686,4,B002B55QP6,"Now seriously, don't go taking a movie like this too seriously. It's low budget, campy, cheesy at times, but overall it's good fun.  You can tell a lot of work was put into this from the filmmakers on a shoestring budget. It has a few recognizable faces like ""Turtle"" from the North Shore and Joe Estevez.  Mostly it is making fun of movie in the genre and it came out way before walking dead so don't bother comparing the two.  Kick back and have fun with it and you'll enjoy it.",1488153600,,480,4.252747252747253
8360687,1,B002B55QP6,I guess any idiot with friends who are willing to embarrass themselves on camera can make moving pictures but..a movieNOT!  This is the worst depiction of a zombie movie I have ever seen.  I love B movies but this crap makes them look like academy award winning films.  If there was a rating less than 1 star this moving picture would rate it.  This isn't even a Z movie.  Horrible.so don't waste your money like I did!,1389916800,,419,4.3896103896103895
8360688,3,B002B55QP6,This was a pretty good zombie movie. The story was good and there was lots of gore. The special effects were cheezy at times and there were one or two spots when the story draged. But over all i enjoyed it. 3.5 stars,1261785600,10,216,4.046511627906977
