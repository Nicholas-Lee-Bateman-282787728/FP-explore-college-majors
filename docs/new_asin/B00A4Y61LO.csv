5381849,1,B00A4Y61LO,"Why would WWE put the rock on the cover with the title, what if someone hasn't watched and decided to watch starting on this PPV? this is a bad move by the WWE and their distributing  still love them though. the PPV was great",1359676800,4,225,4.113636363636363
5381850,4,B00A4Y61LO,"Normally I wait until the end to give my summary but based off how I see the previous reviews along with the amount of votes they've been getting, I'll give it now.  I'm not the type of person who only concentrates on the match result before the match itself & I'll give the devil it's due if that match was pretty damn good or entertaining regardless if I like the winner or not.  I personally didn't want C.M. Punk's title reign to end (and for those who will complain about spoilers, just look at the DVD cover!) nor did I want to the person who won the Rumble to win it but I'm not going to deny that this was the best Rumble event from the undercard matches to the Rumble itself in at least the last two to three years regardless of who won the matches.

Last Man Standing Match: World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Big Show - We get a special treat before the match as Del Rio & Ricardo Rodriquez get some encouraging words from Bret Hart backstage before making their way to the ring.  Big Show took control early with heavy chops to Rio's chest before he recovered taking out Big Show's legs while also catching Show in a frankensteiner when he went for a powerbomb & delivering a top rope legdrop to take Show down as Del Rio continued to use a chair to keep show down.  Show would eventually catch Del Rio & made him pay for with his power such as a chokeslam, slam on the floor, and beating him up using the entrance stage before delivering on high chokeslam that had Del Rio crashing on the way down before making their way back to the ring where they continued to fight using whatever was around from the barricade, chair, steel steps, fire extinguisher, Ricardo Rodriquez getting involved, and a prop we've seen make a big different in another Last Man Standing match in recent years.  While I liked their previous Last Man Standing match on SmackDown better, this was still a good match showcasing Big Show at the dominate giant while Del Rio as the smaller man who brought a fight.

Tag Team Champions Team Hell No vs. Team Rhodes Scholars - Hell No was in control early on with Kane using his power strikes while Bryan has some offense himself like a suicide dive onto both on the outside & applying a surfboard submission during the match.  Rhodes Scholars had to resort to cheating behind the referee's back in order to gain the advantage & continued to single out Bryan with even Cody applying a variation of the half crab submission of his own with Kane waiting for the hot tag on the apron.  This was a solid tag team match using the typical ""tag team wrestling 101"" formula in regards to how both teams worked throughout the match with the only real negative being that we've seen them fight on TV various times that this match didn't stand out.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - As usual, WWE put together a great ""by the numbers"" video package featuring facts & highlights from the previous Rumble matches. Various moments include Dolph kissing A.J. so hard during his entrance that you would think he was going to swallow her, the #2 entrant being a blast from Dolph's past, the Rhodes family reunion, Sheamus' dominate entrance, the returns of Rey Mysterio & Sin Cara, how Kofi saved himself from elimination this year, the return of the Ho Train, Team Hell No, The Miz vs. Antonio Cesaro, NXT star Bo Dallas entering the Royal Rumble & having his ""Undertaker/Maven"" moment, Sheamus vs. Randy Orton, and when it got down to the final five.  While I didn't agree with the winner, I won't deny that this Rumble was entertaining from start to finish & way better than what we got last year.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. The Rock - Both men started off trading fist with the brawl going in & out of the ring with a funny part happening with Rock taking off the lid of the spanish announce table only for Punk to keep putting it back on & even doing a comedic jester to the announcers.  A distraction by Heyman allowed Punk to take control using a unique head vice submission while also taking the match back on the outside with a springboard dropkick to Rock on the apron, top rope double axe handle, and suicide dive.  They eventually continued to trade momentum allowing for some good sequences like a GTS to Rock Bottom to Anaconda Vice to pin attempt & later how Rock was able to counter a pin attempt by Punk into the Sharpshooter as the action continued back on the outside & in the ring that eventually resulted in one announce tables destroyed before the lights went out & the other table was broken as well.  While this was another case where I personally wouldn't have chosen the guy who did win the match, I won't deny that this was a quality match between the two that at times did come off as a fight as much as a wrestling match.

I already gave my ""bottom line"" in the beginning that this was the best Rumble PPV from top to bottom in the past few years as far as quality goes regardless of who won what match so if you can get past that part then this is a show I would go out of my way to see.",1359590400,7,5026,4.382384532760472
5381851,2,B00A4Y61LO,"If you're wondering how the WWE can screw up its otherwise one of the more exciting PPVs of the year, then look no further.  The name of the game here is unimaginative and predicatable endings.

It says something when my favorite match of the night was the preshow match on youtube between Cesaro and Miz for the US title.

The first match, which is also the worst of the night, is an absolute snooze fest between the new face Del Rio and Big Show.  I don't know how many agree with me, but GET THE BIG SLOW OUT OF THE WORLD TITLE PICTURE.  It is the same match we saw the previous week on Smackdown, and also the same match we saw at the Extreme Rules 2010 main event.  Did I mention it was a last man standing match?  Doesn't matter however, slow pace, no violence, horrible ending.

Next we have the 493rd rematch for the tag titles between team Hell No and Rhodes Scholars.  Your $54.99 gets put to good use here folks..I couldn't decide whether I was watching a contest for the tag titles, a typical Raw match, or an episode of ""Finding Bigfoot.""  Kane and Bryan win again, and thankfully hint at a possible breakup in the future.

The rumble match is next and the first two entrants are Ziggler, and the not so surprising return of Chris Jericho.  The match is pretty average for rumble standards with less ""surprise"" entrants and less innovation.  Goldust, Bo Dallas, Godfather to name a few are new faces this year.  WWE does a pretty miserable job of trying to mimmick Kofi Kingston's stunt from last year's rumble with a new ""chair pogo"" angle this time.  We all know who wins this year, not that anyone else deserves it...

Finally is the Rock and CM Punk for the WWE title.  We had gone a few hours on WWE programming without the Shield coming out to attack, so that was long overdue.  The match has pretty good hype from the live audience, and has some exciting moments.  I somewhat enjoyed the match, but knew since last April who was going to win.  Decent way to end a very disappointing show.

I can understand some lazier PPV efforts every once and a while, but it doesn't get too much worse than this, my friends.  Catch some clips online somewhere because this isn't worth your 3+ hours.",1359417600,3,2206,4.421836228287841
5381852,4,B00A4Y61LO,"It was overall a Great Pay-Per-View Event. Lots of great moments stand in the 30-Man Battle Royal full of surprising entries from entrant #1 all the way to entrant #30. Of course Vinnie Mac would let his moneymaker win it. Doesn't change the fact that it was a great Royal Rumble match worth watching. As for the main event, I wish the WWE Championship match wouldn't end with interference and restarting the match, hoped for both Punk and Rock to put out a great multiple maneuver wrestling match. But in the end, it's worth purchasing.",1359331200,4,537,4.663157894736842
5381853,2,B00A4Y61LO,"Alberto Del Rio vs Big Show (World title) Last Man Standing: I expected Show to win but in one of the less predictable matches of the night Alberto won when Ricardo taped Show's feet to the ropes during an armbar by Aleberto.
  Team Hell No vs Team Rhodes Scholar: In a surprisingly not too long match Bryan made Sandow tap to the No Lock.
  The Rumble: In an exciting Rumble with a surprise Jericho apperance lame Cena ruined it by predictably making Ryback look weak and winning in the end. The WWE must think that most WWE fans are morons by acting as if every year for the last 8 years haven't been his. 2012 had him undeservingly beat Lesnar with 2 moves after Lesnar carried him, had him undeservingly win MITB when he didn't need it to get a shot, then he undeservingly won wrestler of 2012.
  So if Cena will some how be shoved in our face more than ever in 2013, I think I've had enough of WWE and the PG ""Predictable Garbage Era.""
  The Rock vs Punk (WWE World Title) : Sorry WWE but we have known for a year that the Rock would win the title at the Rumble and then drop it to dumb Cena and leave again after WM. I'd rather see the Rock stay and Cena leave.
  Anyway Punk won after the lights went out and the Shield attacked the Rock. However Vince came out and was going to strip Punk of the title and the Rock asked the match to be restarted.

5381855,5,B00A4Y61LO,"How the WWE leading itself towards its own downfall, they needed to do something to fix themselves fast. But now, after watching this, I believe that I finally saw once again a true classic PPV.

The 2013 Royal Rumble: During the Royal Rumble Match, I followed it all. I guessed what would happen next, and was right. But this was another one of those Rumble matches with a whole lot of shocks, including returns from the best. Enjoy!

CM Punk (C) VS The Rock for the WWE Championship - If The Shield got involved in the match, then Punk would be stripped of the title: Like always, this was just another title defense match for Punk with another plan that would make sure he would have his ""life's work"" live on. Even with the stipulation involved Punk won because of The Shield by having the arena's lights turned off where they ganged up on and Triple Powerbombed The Rock! But all good and bad things come to an end. I mean come on, even with the lights off, you could hear The Shield, see their attack The Rock from all the camera flashes, and having JBL, Cole, and King only 3 feet away. You could even hear both Cole and King yelling and screaming that ""This is a highway robbery!"", ""This is ridiculous!"", ""You got to be kidding me!"", and ""It's The Shield! That's the damn Shield and they are attacking The Rock!"" After Punk got up with a fake surprised look and Paul Heyman just sitting down laughing, threw him in the ring to get the pin.

""Best in the World!"" or so he says. Not so fast! Mr. McMahon comes to remind Punk of what would happen if The Shield got involved. But before he stripped Punk of his ""Life's Work!"", Rocky had the match restarted instead where Punk's reign fell to ""The Great One!""

That's Right CM Punk, You are no longer ""The Best In the World""!!!!!",1359244800,,1782,4.390909090909091
5381856,4,B00A4Y61LO,"Can The Rock complete his quest to once again hoist the WWE Title? Will newly crowned World Champion Alberto Del Rio be able to knock the monster Big Show down for a 10 count in a Last Man Standing Match? And who will win the 30 man over the top rope Royal Rumble Match and earn a title shot at Wrestlemania? It's time for the Royal Rumble event.

-Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Alberto Del Rio (Champion) vs. The Big Show: A couple of weeks prior Del Rio shockingly won the World Title on Smackdown, so we have this rematch and Bret Hart greets Alberto and Ricardo backstage and gives Ricardo his sunglasses. Del Rio employs a hit and run offense but Show uses his strength and just over powers the champion early on, Alberto makes great use of a steel chair, Show takes over and just wears him down.

Del Rio takes a nast spill through a table from the staging in the entrance way, however  Show misses a spear crashing through barricade. In the ring, Alberto slaps on the cross arm breaker in the ring and Ricardo duct tapes Show's feet to the ropes and he gets counted down for 10 so Del Rio retains. 7/10.

-Dolph Ziggler is backstage saying he picked #1 to enter, Big E. Langston grabs the mic from Matt Striker and does a weird news announcer voice talking up how Ziggler will win.

-World Tag Team Championship Match, Team Hell No (Champions) vs. Team Rhodes Scholars: These two teams had feuded off and on for the a few months, this was good PPV match where Sandow and Rhodes targeted Daniel Bryan. Kane did do well displaying his power and threw around both men, it ended when Kane hit a chokeslam on Rhodes then Sandow ends up in Bryan's No Lock and taps out so the champs retain. 5/10.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Why it's this early I have no clue, but anyways Dolph Ziggler is #1, Chris Jericho is #2, crowd goes nuts for Jericho when his music hits. Both battle for a few to start the match off well, Santino comes out at #5 and gets a pop but is tossed out quickly by Cody. Titus O'Neill comes out at #7 and displays some power, crowd keeps up with a huge ""Y2J"" chant, Goldust comes out at #9 to a big pop and faces off with Cody Rhodes. Sheamus comes out at #11 and tosses out Titus and David Otunga, Rey Mysterio is #14 and receives not too much of a reaction honestly.

Kofi Kingston gets knocked to the outside but doesn't hit the mat, he ends up on the announce table, grabs JBL's chair and hops to the ring but Cody hits the Distaster Kick and Kingston is gone. Godfather is #17 and is quickly dropkicked out of the ring, John Cena is out at #19 and quickly tosses out Slater and Cody. Wade Barrett eliminates Mysterio, Antonio Cesaro comes out at #22 and has a good showing. Zack Ryder comes in at #25, then Bryan tosses out Kane then gets tossed out by Cesaro.

Randy Orton eliminates Zack Ryder after an RKO, Miz is #28 and attacks Cesaro then at #29 it's Sin Cara who gets virtually no reaction. NXT rookie Bo Dallas entering at #16 eliminates Barrett but gets tossed out soon after and hit with the Bull Hammer Elbow. Ryback is #30 and tosses out Sandow and Sin Cara, things pick up now with many close calls. Jericho gets eliminated by Ziggler, Orton hits a few RKO's but Ryback clotheslines him over the top. Sheamus hits the Brogue Kick on Dolph and he is gone, Ryback takes it to Sheamus and ends up eliminating the Celtic Warrior. Down to Cena and Ryback and surprise to no one, Cena ends up winning the Rumble to go to Wrestlemania XXIX. 10/10.

-WWE Championship Match, CM Punk (Champion) w/Paul Heyman vs. The Rock, If The Shield Interferes Punk Will Lose The WWE Title: The build-up for this was pretty intense and it started out fast and went outsitde a few times with some stiff shots. Punk focuses on the bad ribs, with body scissors and a variation of the Anaconda Vice, Rock is really on the defensive for a good portion of this match. Punk hits a nice suicide dive slamming Rock into the floor, Punk seems to be favoring his surgically repaired knee which Rock begins to focus on.

Rock counters the GTS, but gets caught in the Vice and finally breaks the hold and hits a snap DDT. Rock gets the Sharpshooter on but Punk won't give up and gets to the ropes. Both men go outside and fight on the Spanish Announce Table, but it collapses under the weight of Punk and Rock. We have a Rock Bottom on the floor, back in the ring Punk comes back with a big kick and both men trade punches and kicks. It's the People's Elbow, but the lights go out and in the dark The Shield attacks and powerbombs Rock through the announce table. Punk puts Rock in the ring and covers him to win and retain. Until.....Vince McMahon's music hits and he comes out to strip him of the title, but Rock cuts him off and says to restart the match. So he does and Punk takes it to Rock hitting his big moves including the top rope elbow. He goes for the GTS, but Rock counters hits the People's Elbow and covers to win the title. 7/10, for the bs finish.

I should add I'm not a hater of The Rock, I've been a big fan of his for years, I just feel that with him likely leaving right after Wrestlemania he shouldn't have been won the championship. He doesn't need the title as he's a big time legend in most people's eyes and him being a part time champion really devalues the product in my opinion. Guess this means we'll be having Rock/Cena II, which I'm not sure many people were clamoring for.

This was way better than the previous Rumble event even with the dumb finish to the WWE title match. So I would recommend getting this when it comes out on DVD.",1359244800,4,5602,4.3196955280685065

I hated the ending, it was fine a few years ago when Cena did it but here it came off stupid and corny. Call me a hyprocrite.

Tag Team Champions Team Hell No VS Rhodes Scholar: Same as before, wrestling was fine but just like you'd watch on free tv.

Royal Rumble: Chris Jericho returns in a surprise and puts on a great show. A good Rumble despite Super Cena winning.

WWE Champion CM Punk VS The Rock: Rock declared a title shot months in advance even though he did nothing to deserve it. CM Punk had held the title for over a year. This is the problem with WWE-bringing back old talent rather then build up the roster they already have. As of this review, Punk left WWE and I don't blame him. The two matches between Rock-Punk both sucked.

5381890,4,B00A4Y61LO,"WWE Championship Match (MAIN EVENT): CM Punk(c) (w/ Heyman) vs. The Rock
- The Rock first Title match since, I believe, Summerslam '02. And the crowd was HOT for this one. Which is an eccomplishment in its self, cause it followed the  Rumble match. That match takes the crowd on a roller coaster. But you have two guys who can control the audience, you have magic. A lot to live up tooo, right? They did a pretty good job. I've always thought that the rematch at ECPPV was better. But anyways, good match here. Back and forth. The lights go out, and The Shield put The Rock through the announcer's table. Punk wins by countout, till McMahon comes out reminds Punk of the rule he gave him. Before he could vacant the WWE Title, Rock says no. He'll take the title from him, restart the match. So they did. Spinebuster. And then the, People's elbow. The Rock becomes the WWE Champion, again!  3.7/5 stars.

30 MAN ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH
- These matches are always fun and great to watch, especially with a bunch of friends. ANYWAYS. Ziggler starts the match at #1 and #2.. Chris Jericho! The man he retired. Awesomeness. Godfather and Goldust also returned for the Rumble match. The six men were Dolph Ziggler, Chris Jericho, Ryback, Sheamus, Randy Orton, and John Cena. Really cool that Ziggler and Jericho lasted that long, shows how truly great they are. Ziggler eliminated Jericho with a superkick. Sheamus elimates Ziggler. Ryback eliminates Orton and Sheamus. Then to win the Rumble match, Cena eliminated Ryback. Always fun match, even though Cena won. It was real fun! Cena wins. 4/5 stars.

WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: TEAM HELL(C) VS. TEAM RHODES SCHOLARS
- Fun little decent match here. Not much to it, the story here was Daniel Bryan's knee here. Daniel Bryan and Kane win and retain the Tag titles. By submission. 3/5 stars.

LAST MAN STANDING MATCH FOR THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE: ALBERTO DEL RIO(C) VS. BIG SHOW
- A rematch from Smackdown a couple weeks before, where Del Rio beat Big Show for the World Title in a Last Man Standing. Fun match with some sweet spots, awesome choke slam off of a stage prop through a table. With a little help from duct tape and Ricardo, Del Rio retains the Title. 3.5/5 stars.

ROYAL RUMBLE 2013

I am a big fan of the Royal Rumble and in fact it is my favorite of the big five PPV's [I am including King of the Ring, oh how I miss you]. Any way this year's was a good one with some highly entertaining moments. Along with the Rumble itself we get three title matches so it was a fun event.

1.[LAST MAN STANDING WORLD TITLE MATCH]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS BIG SHOW-the first match of the night was the World Title match. But before it started we got to see the legendary Bret Hart talking with Del Rio backstage. Then we get into this hardcore match which was an entertaining brawl. They would use whatever they could get their hands on to beat down the other. The biggest moment of the match would have to be Del Rio getting chokeslamed onto a table. It is where it happened that made that something special. I liked the ending here as I was wondering at the time if Del Rio won how would he do it. Their first last man standing match on Smackdown ended with Del Rio trapping Show under a table to keep him down. Here he would tape his feet around the ropes leading to his victory and keeping the belt.

2.[TAG TITLE]TEAM HELL NO VS TEAM RHODES SCHOLARS-the second match would see the unlikely tag champs taking on the highly arrogant challengers. This was a good match in which the heel team pulled off the usual heel tactics and worked over the smaller Bryan. It had a good pace and some nice action from both sides. Kane used his strength to overpower Cody and Sandow that and Bryan submission skills lead to them taking home the victory.

3. ROYAL RUMBLE-as usual the Rumble match was fun and featured many memorable moments. Kofi continued his new Rumble gimmick which is how can he be thrown out but still stay in, which is cool.  There was also the surprise entrants like The Godfather and Y2J of course. Dolph looked great here since he is the HBK/Mr. Perfect of these days. All the action was fun and moved a good pace with Cena coming out on top again and going to Mania against The Rock.

4.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS THE ROCK-this was a really good match and best of the night for sure. These two worked well together and kept the action going with brawling all over the place. The counters here are great as well and Rock is hilarious of course. I was so behind Punk here and wanted him to win so bad so when the lights went out and Punk won a little bit later I was very happy with the outcome. But Vince came out and restarted the match at Rock's request since he knew the Shield had put Rock threw the table. This lead to some The Rock getting the title once again in his career, I like The Rock but the wrong man won in my opinion.

This was a good Rumble in my opinion as every match was entertaining. I do not like that Punk lost the title but unfortunately that was not my call. All the non Rumble matches were really good and the Rumble itself had some fun moments as always. The event was not as great as the old school Rumbles but as far as the last Rumbles are concerned it was good.",1379376000,2,3023,4.2287694974003465

In recent years however, I have found the WWE to be incredibly boring, and not worth the time. However, I took a chance on this year's Royal Rumble because the Rock was fighting for the championship. It is in the top 3 PPVs I've ever seen, and probably easily the best one since the attitude era. I used to order 'Mania every year, but after being disappointed from XX on, I stopped. After seeing the direction they have taken now, I will definitely start watching again. Every match on this disk is great. Seeing Golddust in the Royal Rumble match was just great. If you are on the fence for this item, go for it! It is well worth the money!",1362873600,,767,4.224489795918367

The segment is 45 minutes long and includes the run up from jan. raws up to the rumble title match. Always have been a fan of the Rock and glad to see him beat punk for title. The rest of the ppv/dvd gets 2 stars- Del rio beats big show same way cena beat batista few years ago (taping legs), boring tag team match, and cena wins the rumble(yawn). Heres to the Rock beating cena twice at Wrestlemania 2013!",1362614400,,493,4.145833333333333
5381927,5,B00A4Y61LO,"Okay I LOVE WWE & the Royal Rumble is my most #1 favorite WWE Pay-Per-View of the year however this year's Royal Rumble disappointed me a little bit because of three reasons. Reason 1 is this Pay-Per-view is called Royal Rumble but however the Royal Rumble Match was not the last match why WWE why do you name a Pay-Per-View Royal Rumble & not make the Royal Rumble Match the Main Event? If you're not going to make the Royal Rumble Match the Main Event then what's the point of calling this Pay-Per-View Royal Rumble? second reason is not really because of the Pay-Per-View Event itself but more because of the DVD & Blu Ray Case front cover. Why put the Rock on the front cover holding the WWE Championship & clearly saying who won between CM Punk & The Rock? What if people have not seen it but want to, they can just find out who won by looking at the front cover. Third & final reason is why WWE did you have The Rock become WWE Champion? We in the WWE Universe all know for a fact that The Rock is just here forWrestlemania Season & that after Wrestlemania he will once again leave the WWE for the rest of the year. Why have The Rock a guy that only comes to WWE during Wrestlemania Season & leave for the rest of the year after Wrestlemania become WWE Champion? That's the most stupid thing you have ever don WWE its just PLAIN STUPID.",1360800000,,1342,4.266666666666667
5381928,3,B00A4Y61LO,The Last Man Standing match for the Worlds title between Alberto Del Rio & The Big Show was fine even with the goofy duct tape ending. The Tag Team title match between Team Hell No(Daniel Bryan & Kane) against Team Rhodes Scholars(Cody Rhodes & Damien Shadow) was not great but pretty good. The Royal Rumble match was a fun thrill with lots of twists & turns like Chris Jericho's return and Kofi Kingston's near elimination trick but the John Cena win was predictable and coming in a mile away. The WWE title match between The Rock & CM Punk was slow-paced but still pretty good even with the restart. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.,1359763200,,632,4.364406779661017
