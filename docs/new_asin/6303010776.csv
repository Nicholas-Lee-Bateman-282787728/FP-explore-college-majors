7834225,4,6303010776,"This film is actually much better than the cheesy cover indicates. As a fan of Adam Beach (Native American actor)I decided to give it a  try...mostly revolving around the central mother-daughter relationship  which is tense and sad, the film slowly moves toward reconciliation and  discovery for both. However, the film does not have the hollywood ending  you would expect (thank God): It is real and sweet but with a bitterness  that will make you think about the characters long afterwards. The cast  does a great job, the location (once out of innercity California) is  beautiful...I only wish the relationship with Will on the daughter's side  was played out in full instead of relying so heavily on the mother-daughter  traumas. Still, the scene where Page (Mia Kirshner)meets Will (Beach) in  the Indian burial ground was perfect.",967507200,8,836,5.125925925925926
