8101818,4,B000CSR4ZE,"He is a more personable Holmes than others who attempt him.  I like these a lot.  They're older, so there's some ""obvious"" acting (like when Holmes sits there for a moment turned to a character before addressing him...waiting for his cue?) but they are simply wonderful.  I'm a fan of the Laurie R. King novels (The beekeepers aprentice, a monstrous regiment of women, etc...) and this is the Holmes (only much older) that I picture when I read them.  He's a softer Holmes, more human somehow.  Just more realistic to me.  It's a good buy to see if you like Ronald Howard's version of Holmes.  The complete series is available through this site as well.  Just do a search on Ronald Howard, and you'll find it.  But this is a good way to see if you like his version.  I currently own this one, and plan on upgrading to the 20-movie set and post this one for sale, or give as a gift (since it's in great condition).",1153872000,2,913,4.380952380952381
