8676751,5,B00NA96AV6,"I received the movie even before it was estimated to arrive so that's good. The only bad thing is that this disc is European Region, which the vendor states I just didn't read hehe. So, my fault.",1475193600,,195,4.297297297297297
8676752,5,B00NA96AV6,"Just an all around masterpiece! If you like metal and death metal you have to see this film. Problem is, this is an overseas DVD/Blu-ray. If you are able to watch this, you will not be disappointed. It's a comedy/drama. From the film's official website: Fueled by a remarkable breakout performance by actress Thora Bjorg Helga, director Ragnar Bragasons intense drama of loss, faith, redemption, Megadeth and Judas Priest begins with a farming accident in the 1980s that sends a young girl, Hera, and her parents into a tail-spin of grief over the death of her heavy metal music-obsessed older brother. A decade later and Hera is transformed into a sexy, surly headbanger and DIY musician, dressed in black leather and a Slayer t-shirt, clutching her dead brothers electric guitar as she howls anthems of rage to a barn full of cows. Seemingly trapped in a haunted landscape of slaughterhouses and barren winter fields, making all the wrong choices in her life  including coming on to the local priest and sleeping with her platonic best friend  Hera slowly, painfully comes to terms with her familys loss and the sound of her own true voice.

Partly inspired by the Norwegian black metal church burnings in the early 1990s, METALHEAD features a soundtrack of 1980s and 1990s headbanging classics by Riot, Teaze, Savatage, Lizzy Borden and Megadeth. Winner of 8 awards at the 2014 Icelandic Film Awards including Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor & Actress, and Original Score.

I think it is on demand on some sites. Check it out and let the Metal Gods reign down on us! And release this for us in the U.S.A.

Be aware that this does not have English audio or even English subtitles!!!!",1467676800,,1689,4.850694444444445

8676754,5,B00NA96AV6,"PHENOMENAL movie. Most people think this is a ""black metal"" movie. It's not. It's a story about a family dealing with a tragic death and having to deal with that. The main character discovers black metal and finds strength in that. I could go on about this movie. But just watch it yourself if you're a 2nd wave BM fan and like a decent movie.",1466208000,,343,4.292307692307692
