7062990,1,B00UNEIZHS,"Cruelty to animals is NEVER entertainment. I am not squeamish, I just find it disturbing and gratuitously mean. Not an esp entertaining movie anyway, but when the bad guys killed a housepet for fun, I was done.",1447804800,3,210,4.702702702702703

7062994,5,B00UNEIZHS,"I loved this movie when I saw it on Lifetime, but I could not find it anywhere except for a ridiculously overpriced option. So, I waited, and I am so happy it was finally released for mass distribution.",1442275200,,202,4.342105263157895

7063000,5,B00UNEIZHS,"Anybody that says this movie was less than mediocre is crazy.  I don't know what people expect of movies these days after millions have been made and many, MANY are redundant.  They've never done a movie like this before and I can most guarantee there won't be a Blindsided 2, 3 or 4 like everything else out there.  I thought it was very well written, good story line, great acting and suspenseful.  A gripping thriller and I enjoyed it very much.  I ordered it months ago when it was still only available oversea's and called ""Penthouse North"" - I couldn't watch it on my DVD player, only on my laptop and remember watching it while waiting for a severely delayed flight for a business trip.  I couldn't wait to see if it would become available on regular DVD and was pleased when it did.  This is a must see for every movie fan who enjoy suspense/thriller movies. You won't be disappointed!",1440028800,8,893,4.509316770186335
7063001,5,B00UNEIZHS,Extremely well done. Great plot,1439942400,,31,5.4
7063002,3,B00UNEIZHS,"A remake of ""Wait Until Dark"", with more gore. Do yourself a favor and check out the original.",1439856000,2,94,4.277777777777778
7063003,3,B00UNEIZHS,This is an enjoyable film that comes across like a play at times.  I liked the way it wrapped up quite a bit.  I'm pretty sure it was at least partly meant as a nod to Batman.,1439596800,,175,3.7027027027027026
7063004,4,B00UNEIZHS,This man is underrated genius  that rarely misses.,1439510400,,50,5.25
7063005,4,B00UNEIZHS,Surprised to find the movie as I have never heard about...very good and with lots of suspense,1439510400,,93,4.529411764705882
7063006,5,B00UNEIZHS,Great Movie,1437868800,,11,5.0
7063007,5,B00UNEIZHS,"wonderful action film, very intense",1437004800,,35,6.2
7063008,4,B00UNEIZHS,Michael Keaton is great as a very bad bad guy. Michelle Monaghan has an incredible performance as the star. Enjoyed this movie.,1436659200,,127,4.818181818181818
7063009,5,B00UNEIZHS,"Michelle Monahan was good playing a blind woman without being too extreme about it. But she did show
more emotion in this movie than others I've seen her in. Michael Keaton always plays a creepy bad guy well. I thought Blindsided was a good movie that held my interest until the end.",1436659200,,283,4.461538461538462
7063010,5,B00UNEIZHS,"Very good, a nice suspenseful movie & action packed",1436486400,,51,4.777777777777778
7063011,2,B00UNEIZHS,Totally implausible takes place in 12 to 14 hours and nobody in the building wonders why the doorman is missing not to mention when the cops finally do arrive and see dimes in the alley at the bottom of the building come on,1436227200,,223,4.209302325581396
7063012,5,B00UNEIZHS,I bought this one on a whim and am so glad that I did. The movie is very suspenseful and will hold your interest to the very end. Keaton knows how to play an evil lunatic to the hilt. Michelle Monahan  was very believable as the blind victim.,1436140800,,242,4.041666666666667

7063015,2,B00UNEIZHS,Not a good Keaton movie. You knew what was going to happen next,1435881600,,63,3.923076923076923
7063016,4,B00UNEIZHS,A well done suspense. Great job done by Michael Keaton and Michelle Monaghan. The story line is believable and holds your attention. Not too violent.  Just enough to keep you on your toes.,1435536000,,188,4.696969696969697
7063017,3,B00UNEIZHS,"Based on the recent Oscar performance, the film industry has opted to cash in by resurrecting and repackaging a sinker Keaton made. This film was originally the flop, ""Penthouse North.""  $9.88 US Walmart

Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) is a war photographer who gets blinded by a suicide bomber. The film starts three years later. We get an indication Sara is a strong person. She lives in an expensive Penthouse with a rich boyfriend (Andrew Walker). It isn't long before this becomes a home break-in film with Michael Keaton and Barry Sloane as the bad guys. It seems her boyfriend wasn't as nice as she thought.

There must be a 100 home break-in films out there, some even involve a blind person. While not a bad film, this one doesn't bring anything new worthwhile to the table. A film you can wait to see.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 7 f-bombs.",1435536000,9,852,4.66
7063018,5,B00UNEIZHS,An excellent film.  The script and actors were superb !  I highly recommend this film.,1435276800,,86,4.666666666666667
7063019,3,B00UNEIZHS,It should have been better with Michael Keaton in it. I guess he just did the movie for the money.,1435190400,,98,3.95
7063020,1,B00UNEIZHS,"It's always disappointing to watch a potentially good movie nosedive.  Seemed this movie banked on selling Michael Keaton's involvement with the film, not the film's story.",1434931200,,172,5.615384615384615
7063021,5,B00UNEIZHS,I would watch anything with Michael.  He is his typical self exciting.,1434499200,,70,4.833333333333333
7063022,4,B00UNEIZHS,This was a pretty good movie.  Reminded me of the movie many years ago where the girl was blind and won over a male intruder.,1434412800,,125,4.0
8707615,5,B00UNEIZHS,It is okay.,1526169600,,11,3.0
8707616,4,B00UNEIZHS,"This was an exciting thriller that had a few twists.  I always enjoy Michael Keaton and this film was another vehicle that showcased his incredible talent.  I am dating myself, but this one reminded me of ""Wait Until Dark"".  The violence seemed over the top, but I understand the reasons why it was deemed necessary.  Overall, this was a heart pounding ride.",1514332800,,358,4.725806451612903
8707617,5,B00UNEIZHS,GOOD MOVIE,1492992000,,10,4.5
8707618,4,B00UNEIZHS,"The story was pretty tight.  It was well put together.  Keaton's character was along the lines of his Pacific Heights character.  I prefer his
multiplicity performance.  The violence was excessive at times.  However, I enjoyed the diamond on the ledge scene.
At times I wondered where everyone else in the building was.  Didn't anyone wonder about the doorman?  I would have
liked to have seen more cast members.",1487894400,,412,4.970588235294118
8707619,5,B00UNEIZHS,Well acted and keeps you in suspense through the enteir moveie.,1486598400,,63,4.818181818181818

8707621,5,B00UNEIZHS,Good thriller. Michael Keaton is good in this villain role.,1482192000,,59,5.0
8707622,3,B00UNEIZHS,just did not care for it very much,1481328000,,34,3.375
8707623,5,B00UNEIZHS,Just watched this movie not too long ago. I would not choose this to be a family movie but for adults its a keeper. For me there are few movies I do not mind watching number of times Blindsided is a good example.,1475020800,,212,3.953488372093023
8707624,3,B00UNEIZHS,"If you liked this movie, you'll love "" Wait until Dark"" staring Audry Hepburn, Alain Arkin ( in his first major film role) and Richard Crena. I'm not saying Blindsided copied Wait Until Dark, but they kinda did.",1474848000,,211,4.578947368421052
