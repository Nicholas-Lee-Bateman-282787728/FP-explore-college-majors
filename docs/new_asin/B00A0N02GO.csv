8545927,1,B00A0N02GO,"I gotta admit I can give little known movies a chance, sometimes even like them but this? Dear god I barely got through the first one, and well they tried for a good story it failed after what seemed to be an ending carried on. The next one had to do with aliens? It was all over the place, bad acting, all off screen damage and kills. Just.. Don't bother.",1375833600,3,356,4.1
8545928,1,B00A0N02GO,"All the movies/documentaries are very boring. I couldn't bring myself to continue watching them, some of the movies are reality documentaries. In the docs, that I didn't watch all the way through, were boring stand or sit around talking about the so called hauntings and history. Plus the psychic medium was unconvincing. Don't get me all wrong, I like ghost/paranormal documentaries, and the reality ghost hunting shows, but they have to be intriguing and have hard paranormal evidence that no skeptic can immediately wave away as fake or trick of the mind, to keep me interested. I'm sad to say I wasted a measly $8.99 on this 2 disc pile of yawn inducing garbage.",1370390400,2,666,4.850877192982456
