3644433,5,B001HUWQ8Q,"An amazing MotoGP season with rookies pushing the limits and the coattails of the veterans. Even more, it's great to say Vale back on top. The Laguna Seca race was the best albeit seeing it live was the ultimate. Wish there was more content for the races and special features.",1231804800,,276,4.54

8309686,5,B001HUWQ8Q,"Jorge Lorenzo is on fire, and he's still a rookie! There's also the classic race at Laguna Seca, a really enjoyable season overall, but the races are short, and that's a bummer.",1375228800,,177,4.5625
8309687,5,B001HUWQ8Q,"I like having the entire season on one disc; but I just wish they showed all of the races in their entirety, and not just the highlights.",1273104000,,137,4.111111111111111
8309688,4,B001HUWQ8Q,"The video quality is mediocre (grainy, VHS-like), but they finally went to widescreen and the commentary by the After the Flag pair, Matt Roberts and Gavin Emmett, is pretty good.",1264204800,,179,5.0
8309689,4,B001HUWQ8Q,This season ('08) was awsome. The best race in years was at Laguna Seca for sure!! Wish they would have shown more of the race in the review. Other than that it was pretty good. It would be cool if they showed more depth with all the reviews.,1236988800,,242,4.0625
8309690,3,B001HUWQ8Q,"The 2008 MotoGP Official Review is not nearly as good as its predecessors. It is down on content and just does not capture the excitement of the previous review DVDs. I know the creators were hurrying to try and get it released in time for the Christmas season, and it really shows where they cut corners. It's not a bad DVD, it's just not what someone expects if they have seen the earlier DVDs.",1236211200,,396,4.364864864864865
8309691,5,B001HUWQ8Q,Must have video of the year if you are a motorcycle racing fan. Great editing and few unimportant footage.,1236124800,,106,4.631578947368421
8309692,1,B001HUWQ8Q,"The same audio mixing problem as 2007 review.  You hear the commentators gettting excited, but you can't feel why because the sound from the engines are so low in the mix it becomes a bore to watch after, oooh, about 5 secs.  If you like exciting motorcycle racing DVD, get the world superbike review.  Soooo much better.",1235779200,3,321,4.5964912280701755
