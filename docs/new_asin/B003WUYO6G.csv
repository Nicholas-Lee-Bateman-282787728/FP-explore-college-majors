8407532,5,B003WUYO6G,"This is the second DVD that I have purchased from Alicia Castillo Holley, and just like the first, it was well worth every penny that I paid.  Her wonderful insight has allowed me to take an idea and move forward with something that I am truly proud of. Sharing this idea, and moving ahead with it, has been more rewarding for me on many levels than I would have ever imagined.  I would have to admit the video  gave me the nudge I needed to put everything in motion.  Instead of turning it around in my head, waiting on who knows what, I became proactive and learned how to present my product.  Great motivator, informative, and for me financially beneficial.  Recommended to all!",1313971200,,681,4.495934959349594
8407533,5,B003WUYO6G,"This video is astounding! The insight that Alicia Castillo Holley gives here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Brain-to-Gain/dp/B003WUYO6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Brain to Gain</a>&nbsp;is extremely unique and needed in today's world where people leverage technology to achieve some incredible advancements and inventions. The bio field is incredibly ripe with new innovations cropping up daily. And those who create these new things, those who think up the new ideas, should understand the process of going from where they are after their accomplishment - a brainer - to sharing your creation with the world. You must be inner-looking in so many ways to create a new model or product or idea and it's difficult to turn that inward-looking self outward once you have completed the project. And the smarter you are, the harder it is for you to do that.

But you must. And that is where From Brain to Gain comes in. To take your creation that you are understandably protective of and share it with others is one of the hardest things for us to do! Yet, why else do we do the things we do, why else do we create what we create? Our highest calling in life is to serve others. And From Brain to Gain shows is clearly how to do that. Scientists and brainers need to be moved from their rightful inward viewpoint to a sharing viewpoint once they have their products to give to the world.

This is difficult. And the smarter you are the harder it is. But you can. And the rewards go far beyond money. Connecting on a human level is the all-important step after your creation. Fighting natural defense mechanisms is vital to the world learning - and gaining - from your work!",1312675200,2,1721,5.013986013986014

If you have a good idea, think that knowledge should be free and that you do not want to burden yourself with things like making money or getting rich: just watch this video and think again.

If you have an invention which is hidden in some library: the video can help you to present it to the world.

Or, if you have an idea, but do not know what to do with it: just watch this video, and things will get clearer.

Alicia is a scientist turned entrepreneur, and thus knows both sides of the invention/money story really well.
She shares some very important insights here, specifically the basics of entrepreneurship, what investors are good for, and also how to earn money from your idea.

And if you decided to start your own  company, I would also recommend her other video:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-fund-your-million-dollar-idea/dp/B002ACPNOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to fund your million dollar idea</a>",1289606400,3,999,5.412903225806452
