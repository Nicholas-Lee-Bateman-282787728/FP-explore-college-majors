8045385,5,B000777HRK,"If you love the spy dramas and the intensity and talent of a James Dean type film actor, but in a television series, buy this gem of a series, you won't regret it. Roy Dupuis is that rare diamond like a James Dean... but add an utterly unique and captivating masculine expression of strength, tempered by an inner humility that is beauty in motion.  Then add an almost yogic-like equanimity about this actor that kills (the bad guys), without hatred, that loves without speaking, that ""is"" so subtly... you can't miss him.  He is not acting, he is ""being"" in a way I have never seen done before.  Roy Dupuis is able to bring to the screen something that commands you to see a certain nobility, an innocence, and an unspoken goodness, if you will, while managing to surive the loss and oppression that are inherent in being an operative at Section One (especially if you are Michael, the character he plays). Section One being the most covert anti-terrorist group on the planet.  In a reality that is as intense as any I've seen in a television series, where life and death hang in the balance moment by moment, he remains utterly untouchable in his perfection, for eyes that have eyes to see... I don't know how else to say it.  This is far beyond a sexual charisma, though that is there, but he is way beyond that. This man is an extraordinary talent that I have yet to see the likes of... This actor has an almost spiritual charisma that trancends any peformance by an actor that I have ever seen.  And the series is the best I've ever seen, mainly due to his presence.  It keeps you riveted to one great episode after another.  Peta Wilson is his perfect compliment as Nikita-- together they make this series happen.  In my life I have never been so affected by an actor: American, or European and the series, as I said, is the best I've seen in my life.  The undercurrent of tension in his sublimated love for Nikita (that is death to them if revealed), is intensely beautiful to watch played out by this duo.  Roy Dupuis, I am thankful you have graced the planet while I am alive to see your work.  Roy Dupuis is able to tap something  close to perfection in this character.  Now I can't wait to see the rest of this man's body of work.  Bravo!",1112745600,11,2249,4.424757281553398
8045386,5,B000777HRK,I bought season 1 and it is quite possibly the best show ever (besides Buffy).  They need to release season 2 now I'm dying to see what happens!!,1101513600,5,145,4.178571428571429
