After injuring my ankle I used this DVD along with other exercises provided by a physical therapist to help my recovery.",1412726400,3,261,4.695652173913044
8654636,5,B00JZ12SHS,"Unlike many instructional DVDs, this one is clear and VERY easy to follow. The narrator gives you plenty of time to watch the exercises and practice them at the same time. You can also use these exercises on someone's feet who is not able to do them for themselves. The results are AMAZING, but be patient--many years of abusing your feet cannot be fixed overnite! Stick with it a couple of weeks and you will have marked improvement.",1398729600,6,434,4.576923076923077
