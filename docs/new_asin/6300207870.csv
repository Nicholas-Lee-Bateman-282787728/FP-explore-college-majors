224852,1,6300207870,"It took me for a while before I forced myself to order this tape. The primary reason for my reluctance was the length of the tape: less than two  hours compared with nearly as double as much for the original version of  this movie. I wondered what scenes they had to cut in order to make the  movie shorter and yet understandable. Led by curiosity I finally purchased  a copy. Unfortunately, this cut successfully met my most pessimistic  expectations. It is difficult to summarize what is wrong here. Deletion of  many key scenes that maintain the integrity of the movie, poor color,  mish-mash of scenes with nearly continuous fighting, difficulty of  understanding who was fighting whom... are only some of the problems.  Original music has been a victim too. An incredible beautiful song present  at the end of the original movie does not appear here. Had I not ever seen  the original version before I would consider this movie as a cheap  spaghetti depiction of World War II in former Yugoslavia. However, knowing  the original score and understanding historical background of this battle,  I find this version unacceptable, as it provides not enough of information  to an uninformed viewer that would allow for better understanding of this  historical event. Although I am thankful to those who made the movie  available at all, I unfortunately cannot recommend this version to anybody.",966124800,16,1393,4.98695652173913

As others have pointed out, this movie is very very confusing due to the heavy editing and multiple jump cuts. This version shouldn't even be offered for sale, it is so poor. Again, good movie, terribly mutilated, by over zealous editing, movie.

224923,2,6300207870,"I had been aware of this movie for quite awhile and was happy to finally get a copy on DVD.  Perhaps because of the poor dubbing, this was little better than the many ""spaghetti"" war films I have in my collection.  While there appears to be a great effort on the producers' part to craft an epic war movie, there is an abysmal lack of contiuity and context.  The technical aspects are pretty well executed, with proper uniforms and weapons.  Also there are ""Tiger"" tank mock-ups based on T-34 chassis as seen in Kelly's Heroes.  And those attacking planes(Sokos maybe?) do resemble FW 190s at first glance, all of which make this film all the more disappointing.  Some great actors seem wasted, and even the legendary Bernard Herman was off his game with his uncharacteristically bland musical score.  I'd like to see it remastered, and with proper subtitles so that the dialogue would be in the respective languages.  Perhaps then this film will earn the ""epic"" description some have chosen to apply to it.",1321488000,3,1007,4.747126436781609
224924,1,6300207870,"While this is a very good war film, it has yet to appear on DVD in a thoroughly acceptable version.  The Hungarian, shortened Spanish, and short US versions are particularly to be avoided.  The Hungarian version is misrepresented as to its length.  Both the cover and the amazon description say it is 165 minutes long, but that is incorrect--it is in fact only 102 minutes long, cutting fully 73 minutes of the original length, and it uses a ghastly, fuzzy, washed out pan and scan fullscreen print.  Almost as bad is the shortened (i.e., not extended) Spanish version, which at 113 minutes has cut more than an hour from the original, and also uses a very bad fullscreen pan and scan print.  I don't know about the extended Spanish version, but if the Amazon description is accurate that it comes in at 145 minutes and is widescreen, that would make it one of the better versions (if a decent print was used), except that as a Region 2 DVD it won't play in most US players, and a multiregion player would be needed.  By far the best print is in the German DVD, which is widescreen and comes in at 144 minutes.  Unfortunately, it has only a German soundtrack and no subtitles, and is also Region 2.  This leaves the UK version, which at about 158 minutes is the most complete of the DVD versions, is widescreen, and has the real advantage that each nationality speaks its own language--Germans speak German, Italians speak Italian, and Yugoslavians speak Serbo-Croatian, each with clear English subtitles.  This makes a big difference in the scene in which Orson Welles as the Chetnik leader fires up the Chetniks.  Unfortunately, the UK version uses a washed-out widescreen print that misses much of the color and detail of, for example, the German version.  And of course, the UK version is also Region 2 and will not play in most US players unless they are multiregion.  So far, the UK version wins out, though if you like this film you might want the really good German print. If anyone knows whether the extended, widescreen Spanish version uses a clear print (like the German one of the same length), that would be worth knowing, as if the same print is used as in the German version, the presence of English (and other) subtitles might make that the preferred version, despite being only 144 minutes compared with the UK version's 158.",1321315200,4,2342,4.671532846715328

224926,1,6300207870,"Very possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.  My wife and I had just returned from a vacation in what was formerly Yugoslavia and while their aw where the the battle for Neretva took place, including a to scale replica of the bridge that was intentionally destroyed during the battle and now protrudes from the river.  Our guide recommended we see the movie and since we were unable to rent it, we purchased the DVD.

The description of the storyline has already been provided in several previous reviews, so I will skip that.  The film was released in 1969.  It was originally 172 minutes long, but this NTSC formatted version for the  U.S. market has been cut to only 102 minutes.  Previous reviewers have said that truncating the movie makes the story confusing and I totally agree.  This film is very difficult to follow, and given its age, it shows very poorly on a large screen TV-blurred,etc.  It was very frustrating to watch--confusing plot, poor picture quality, and dated special effects.  Behind the grainy photography you do get a look some famous actors when they were much younger, but be prepared to be disappointed overall.",1318982400,12,1143,4.785714285714286

224930,3,6300207870,"THE BATTLE OF NERETVA is one of the best war films I have ever seen. It focuses on a group of partisans who battle the Germans, Italians, Chetniks and the elements to reach a strategic bridge in southern Yugoslavia. This epic has excellent battle sequences, a great script, and fairly good dubbing. However, the print of the video I saw ran 106 minutes, and in some places it lost coherency -- I had to watch it multiple times before I could understand what was going on. Secondly, the video is from an unrestored negative, making for very bad picture quality.
The basic story:
Hitler reorganizes his forces -- German and Italian troops, as well as the Chetniks and Ustasha factions to carry out Plan Weiss, a major offensive to crush the Yugoslav partisan movement. Their aim was to prevent an allied sea-borne invasion of the Balkans.
As the enemy forces launched their offensive, the partisans pull out of the town of Bihac and movie along the open road south, toward the Italian held city of Prozor. They march with over 4,000 wounded and over 10,000 refugees.
After heavy fighting the Partisans manage to crush the Italian forces at Prozor, and then continue south until they reach the town of Konjic on the bank of the Neretva river, occupied by Chetnik forces. The partisans manage to capture the town, but as they are fighting the Chetniks, the pursuing German forces in the north catch up with them and attack their column of wounded with aircraft and tanks. The partisans must turn around and defend their wounded. Rather than leave the bridge open to cross, the partisan commander destroys it to prevent enemy cavalry from crossing and closing in on their rearguard.
During a pitched battle with the enemy forces, the partisans manage to halt their advance. While fighting, a group of engineers builds a footbridge over the wreckage of the destoryed bridge. Once this is done, the partisans move their hospital group out and across the bridge, along with all of the refugees and military personnel. They burn the makeshift bridge behind them.
Now that they are across the river, the partisans move out to engage the enemy cavalry massed on the opposite bank ... but who will win out? You've got to see the film for it's incredible final battle scene.
This is really an incredible film. It has some big-name actors playing the leads -- Yul Brynner as a coolheaded Partisan demolition man; Sergei Bondarcuk as a stubborn Partisan artillery commander; Curt Jurgens as the commanding German General; Silva Koscina as an emotional partisan girl; Hardy Kruger as a German colonel obssesed with victory; Franco Nero as an Italian captain who wants to fight for good and not evil; and Orson Welles in a small part as a Chetnik senator.
A good movie, worth [item price] for the story but only the $10 price for the quality of the tape.",1010793600,5,2837,4.780040733197556
224931,5,6300207870,"... realistic & faithful to the historical facts. The major partisans' shortcoming was that they apparently did not exterminate all the chetniks, since they resurfaced in the 1900s to ignite a series of not less than 4 wars..",1010448000,5,225,4.947368421052632
224932,5,6300207870,"Yugoslavia's troubles go back over 600 years. The break up of the country in the 1990s was foreshadowed in 1945. When Marshal Tito and his Partisans seized power, he merely papered over the old ethnic hatreds. It worked fine until his death in 1980. The collective presidency worked fine until nine years after his death. Then it broke down when Slobodan Milosevic seized power. Saying the following: ""You want a greater Serbia? Follow me and I'll give it to you!"" Battle of Neretva is about the German occupation of Yugoslavia and the fight between the Cetniks, the nationalist resistance, which was accused, (some say falsely), of collaborating with the Germans, and the Partisans. The Partisans never left anyone behind. They even went into hospitals and took out anyone who was capable of fighting. Even those who were sick.",996710400,6,828,5.007246376811594
