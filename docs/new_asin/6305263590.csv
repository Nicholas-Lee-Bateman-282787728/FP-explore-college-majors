999064,3,6305263590,"There are 3 types of people this movie will appeal to. Gay men, women hard up to see built men in their skivvies and die-hard Jaime Pressly fans (the last one would be me). If you're looking for a story or even a cheesy B movie to have fun with then look elsewhere. The main goal of this movie is to show men in their underwear. For me the nude love scene with Jaime Pressly for a few minutes in the prime of her prime look wise was worth the cheap price of the movie. Don't go thinking you are going to get anything like Poison Ivy the new seduction with this movie. There is only the one scene.

I was disappointed that after waiting forever for this to be released on DVD that they didn't do it in widescreen. I was hoping that they included both wide and full on the DVD but no such luck. I also have the region 2 copy of this movie and it is in widescreen, but it only plays on my computer not in my DVD player.",1296604800,7,916,3.9782608695652173
999065,1,6305263590,"Mario Lopez and his co-stars, B/Teen-movie queen Jamie Pressly and Richard Grieco should have had a long talk with their agents, asking ""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??"" by getting them involved in this disaster. Lopez had already gotten favorable reviews for his acting in ""Breaking the Surface"" by the time he shot this, and this was several steps backward, to his ""Bell"" days.

Lopez plays Ryan Murphy, a cadet at a military training ""academy"" in the dark barren and frozen country that was once the USA, before it was wiped out (along with most of the earth and its inhabitants) by a meteor a couple of decades earlier. The academy, training hunky young men to protect the ""New America"" (from what, it isn't exactly clear), is headed up by the self-described ""hardass"" Sgt Bradley (overplayed with a perpetual grimace by Grieco), who puts the best of his troops through special training (and on a diet of steroids) to be part of something called the ""Z-Team"", which is actually his creation to help the aliens who first tried to destroy earth to come and take it over. (If you are shaking your head saying ""Whaaaat?"", be assured it is not any clearer when you are watching it.)

Now I'll admit I am a fan of really BAD science fiction films, but this one doesn't even deserve to be considered part of that genre. The story has holes in it you can pass a meteor through, the dialogue could not be any more predictable if that was your goal, a special effects budget I'd estimate at about two bucks, plot developments that make no sense whatsoever, and overacting runs rampant. Much of the dialogue seems ad-libbed, such as Grieco's frequent exclamations of ""For Pete's sake"" which are ludicrous for his character. However, since the film is directed by David DeCocteau (known for his schlocky quasi-horror films that uniformly feature hunky young guys in boxer briefs), you know you'll see Mario and his fellow cadets in their ""tighty whities.""

What about Jamie Pressly? She plays a prostitute, one of two who are somehow allowed to roam freely through the academy. Considering most of the scenes with them are simply watching her friend dance topless while the boys hug each other or burn each other with cigars (Never mind the fact that they're all stripped to their boxer briefs), it's obvious the only reason they are there is to avoid assumptions that the soldiers of the future are all gay. Don't ask, don't tell, indeed!  There is one sex scene between Pressly and Lopez, in which Lopez manages to keep his white boxer-briefs on so long it is almost laughable. Very brief shot of rear nudity.

I could go on and on about the stupidity in this film (why the locker room has hundreds of lockers, when it is apparent the academy holds maybe 20-25 guys at most; how Lopez and Pressly can OUTRUN an explosion, especially since they pause mid-run several times to look back at it; and how they had the nerve to use what looks like a standard web camera as the ""alien communication device"" Grieco uses). Suffice it to say that the only reasons to see this film might be (1) if you are obsessed with Mario Lopez, (2) you enjoy seeing a dozen or so hunky young men in their boxer briefs, or (3) ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" was just too intelligent for you to follow!",1289520000,12,3265,4.651646447140381
999066,2,6305263590,"After most of the Earth was destroyed by a meteor, there exists a boot camp of New America in the Arctic. Now there seems to be people living in other areas, but we never get a feel for that. Ryan Murphy (Mario Lopez) shows up at this boot camp because his friend is missing plus there are odd things going on. (I liked this plot better when it involved prison girls.) Richard Grieco plays a psychotic Sargent, who idolizes Nixon. Murphy is assigned to Echo Group and immediately doesn't fit in. Somehow pretty females are allowed to go into the cadet's barracks for drunken comfort sessions including Jamie Pressly who makes love to Ryan Murphy on his extra wide army cot. It is nudity which deserves four stars, but the movie stank so bad I could only muster 2 stars in spite of Jamie's perky effort.

They don't even bother to hide the fact that she's got panties on the whole time and is doing nothing but emotionless posing throughout. It's so unerotic that it's hardly even worth calling it a sex scene. You're better off searching for a d-load of that scene to see for yourself that it's a dud. Just plain dull, like the film.

999544,3,6305263590,"An OK scifi of space cadets meet alien agenda with Mario Lopez and Jaime Pressly, who mime the most chaste nude love scene since cameras stopped panning away. Richard Grieco as the sarge plays the Michael Ironside type with evil glee. The effects and look are good, and you've got to admire Slater's athleticism, but the sets are small and the guys are not tall, and the story and dialogue are not a big deal. Anyway, I enjoyed thinking about how it was made.

Justin Walker [Clueless] and Greg Serano [Legally Blonde] round out the beefcake on display. I mention them that way because of the director: David DeCoteau directs here without the camp of his classics like Voodoo Academy or his vampire fratboys movies but with a nod to his love of white boxer briefs, a proclivity that's drawn a long line of name male actors. [Just please avoid his later work, the 1313 series, which is without exception and regardless of title, unknowns in white briefs sleepwalking through pricey real estate. No kidding.]

Too bad it's not USA compatible on DVD, because I'd like to have this decent record of these actors. I won't get the Amazon cloud version because I've read their T&C, but I might pick up a $40 Philips DVP3560 multi-region and get the Euro DVD.",1469923200,,1251,4.656108597285068
