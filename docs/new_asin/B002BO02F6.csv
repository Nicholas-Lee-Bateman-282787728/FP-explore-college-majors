We only listened once and since then its in dumps, if anyone of you want it write your address and we will send it to you for free
its that awful.",1406246400,,351,4.253731343283582
8361683,5,B002BO02F6,"It is difficult enough finding quality video instruction for Hindustani music, let alone trying to track down a Carnatic series. This video (and level 2) cover what would normally encompass several months of study with a guru. The exercises (Alamkara) are very beneficial to the voice and the theory sections give a very clear understanding to South Indian music making. All in all, it is a wonderful product.",1294790400,2,409,5.029411764705882
