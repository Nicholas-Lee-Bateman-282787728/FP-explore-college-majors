7004494,4,B00TE22Z26,"Lei is an orphan and a warrior. He joins the infamous Black Tigers gang as an ""adopted son"" by bringing back the head of a rival gang. The gang controls the piers as well as gambling, opium dens, and brothels. Lei works as a mole within the Black Tigers aiding the Orphan Gang to retake the piers and avenge the deaths of their fathers and free the 300. Film also has an attempt at a love story and has flashbacks.

This is a very long nearly epic tale of a man who championed the people vs. the ""villains."" The film has some good choreographed ""Kill Bill"" type of over-the-top martial arts. Just of touch of the anti-gravity. Most of the English subtitles had smooth translations. There were some minor problems with plurals and ""Iam"" should be two words. This is a martial arts film that has a lot of plot to go with it. There are knife cuts, blood, severed heads, etc. The sex scenes are toned down. We do see a woman's bare back. We see her garment groped, but never with a face attached to it. I wasn't sure what he was grabbing. The Three adopted sons represented 3 evils: Blood thirst, greed, and lust. I am sure there was more symbolism in the film that I didn't grasp.

No F- bombs, sex, or nudity. If you like the martial arts films coming out of China, this is a good one. Good cinematography as usual.",1429660800,7,1313,4.3117408906882595
7004495,4,B00TE22Z26,"Another wuxia epic tale based upon the life of Wong Fei-Hung- who was a real person but whose life has taken on an almost mythic quality in Chinese culture.

In this film, Wong is the son of a humanitarian doctor (Tony Leung) who administers to the poor and shelters orphans.  He becomes close friends with three of the children, including one boy whom he helped his father to save- his best friend, Fiery.  Even so he cant always protect the ones he cares about and one of them, Little Fa, is kidnapped and sold into prostitution.  After an act of sabotage destroys the orphanage and kills Wongs father, Wong and Fiery swear revenge.  Fate intervenes as a monk takes in Wong and Fiery, training them and helping them understand what it is they truly mean to accomplish.

Years later, Wong (Eddie Peng Yuyan) is brought in along with several other fighters to hunt down and kill the leader of the rival gang on the docks; whoever does so gets promoted to an Underboss under Master Liu (Sammo Hung)- adopted as his Fourth Son.  Having done so, Wong and his friends set in motion their plans to bring down the Black Tiger Gang.  Wong plays them against each other, preying upon their insecurities and vices in order to destroy them from within.  But being heroes means theres always a heavy price to pay- especially in Chinese cinema.

The plot unfolds in typical Chinese cinema fashion- flashbacks interlaced with current events, revealing the entire story in pieces.  One thing Ill add is I really liked the cinematograpy.  A few things that stood out about it were the use of a POV angle during the early fight scenes- later abandoned, don't know why- which was an interesting change of pace.  Another was the waves of Chi energy emanating from some of the moves and weapons used during fights.  Third was the CGI during the climax inside a burning warehouse.  Even though it was really fake looking at times, I still kinda liked it and the way it affected the battle.  Nice touch.  And its always fun to see Sammo Hung flying through the air with the greatest of ease!  He brings gravitas to the proceedings but you cant help but think inside hes smiling the whole time.

Its not a very original movie, and its stuffed full of tropes, clichs and pop culture references- you cant help but notice the Bruce Wayne/Batman similarities in the story arc as well as the Hunger Games style music cue- but its also a lot of fun!  Its great entertainment, if a little hard to follow sometimes.  Definitely worth watching.",1425254400,9,2513,4.6275395033860045

7004519,3,B00TE22Z26,"I haven't seen a martial arts movie in a while, so I was looking forward to this one.

+ Opening scene is action

+ Overall good fighting, but I didn't expect anything less from a Sammo Hung movie

-- The editing or the storytelling with flashbacks or some poor English translations -- I'm not sure which is to blame -- but it was a bit confusing of what was going on sometimes.

> Poor English subtitles in some parts didn't help. My wife is Chinese and translated a couple of items differently than subtitles.

+ My wife appreciated the very, very well spoken and easy to understand Mandarin audio language in the movie

> Use of CGI in a martial arts movie that takes place in 1868, I'm not sure about, but I get it when it's used with the fire scenes.

+ Eddie Pen is a stud and they show him off some in this movie

> Cute asian girls, but they are supporting characters with light sub-plots, so no real focus on them. Thus, when they decide to participate in events, then we (the audience) don't really have any feelings whether they live or die.

> There is a drawn out scene with a ""lady of the night"" that is broken up between that scene and another, so it takes forever to get through. Had to kick the kids out of the room for a bit

> The opening scene has ridiculous blood splatter. After that, I don't remember the rest being that bloody. So why have it in the opening scene? The action would have been fine without it.

+ Streamed this movie from another site, other than Amazon. So the subtitles for any writing were missing. Not that there was a lot of that, but the final scene there is a shot of a building sign and it seemed to matter to the story, but I had no translation, so I don't know the significance. Thus the final scene seemed a bit anti-climatic without knowing it, so watch for it in the end.

OVERALL: I wanted to watch a martial arts movie and I got a good amount of that. I also got a slightly complex story that I was able to follow, for the most part, but almost lost me on other parts in the telling and/or the translation. Since part of the trouble could have been the source I was watching, Amazon's version may be better.

Even with that, the movie is worth watching.",1479340800,,2207,4.226190476190476

Extremely weak acting. Weak fight scenes, a la each actor waiting their turn to fight the bad guy, but waiting for him to finish beating up the next guy before each one attacks. Overall kinda cheesey. The 'bad' guys are practically twirling their mustaches and petting their white kitty. It's certainly not the worst, but nowhere near a quality martial arts movie. It's worth a look by renting. But I wouldn't waste any money on it. Sorry, I wish this could've been a better review.",1464912000,,653,4.7368421052631575

Pretty sure the subtitles sucked, but the tone of voice, body postures, facial expressions were all that was needed to project meaning on the subtitles.  For the price, the film delivers a very dense two hours of a truly artistic period piece.  Wire work wasn't too over the top.  Fire CGI was a bit much.  Nice sense of karma, destiny and true sacrifice.  Okay, the fat guy being such a tough and spry fighter was bogus, but once that was put aside, the actor did the right moves.

For English, in Options, just click on Caption ""on"" and in Settings you can pick size of font for English translation.  Worked fine for me.",1458950400,10,358,4.709677419354839

7004594,4,B00TE22Z26,"Things started out frustrating as I could not get closed caption to work with the surround sound. It works with other movies, but not this one. I had to connect my laptop to the TV via the HDMI connection to view with subtitles. The picture and sound quality was still quite good. The movie was quite enjoyable. I liked the story, the balance of action and a plot, as well as the camera angles that were used and the development of the characters.",1458518400,3,447,4.397590361445783

7004606,4,B00TE22Z26,"Was Eddie Peng the best choice for a portrayal of the venerable protagonist Wong Fei Hung? While at least Eddie trained for 6 months prior to the role, I found myself yearning for someone with an honest background in martial arts. The right man or no, the subtitles kept me busy enough that it was easy to overlook Rise of the Legend's minor flaws. It's clear that some elements of the film are intended for 3D, but these indulgences are not too extraneous for the 2D viewer.

PROs
+ Remarkable cinematography combined with convincing sets/ locations
+ The plot added depth without being cumbersome; more engaging than wuxia plots
+ Sammo Hung brings old skool cred to Rise of the Legend
+ Steeped in Chinese history and culture of the late 19th century
+ CGI was used, but not abused
+ Somewhat reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle/dp/B000F9RB8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle</a>, without the overbearing humor
+ Diverse film score that was usually appropriate (the song during the closing credits is unpleasant, however)
+ Speaking of the end credits, the artwork/ photographs during them makes the film worth watching til the very end

CONs
- While flashbacks were useful in building the plot, they give Rise of the Legend a choppy, muddled feeling, especially for those of us who need to read subtitles as events unfold.
- The first half had the feel of an epic film, but the second half didn't live up to it (almost anticlimactic).
- To hide Eddie Peng's limited skills as a martial artist, ""wire fu"" was added to already over-edited fight scenes.
- If you only are watching for the fight scenes, then you may be disappointed by the long stints between them.",1430352000,3,1743,5.090909090909091
