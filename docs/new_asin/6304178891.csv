802671,2,6304178891,"Oscar winner Michael Caine plays Henry Jekyll, one of the iconic characters in British literature in ""Jekyll & Hyde,"" a 1990 made-for-TV film. Perhaps the filmmakers thought the original book by Robert Louis Stevenson was so famous that the new film needed a new angle to tell this story once again. So in this revised version Dr. Henry Jekyll appears as an eminent surgeon who is in love with a married woman Sara Crawford played by Cheryl Ladd. The film even has one scene where Michael Caine's doctor is seen kissing Cheryl Ladd's character in the park in broad daylight. But is this supposed to be a romantic story?

Maybe. Anyway, as a thriller, the film doesn't have a single moment of suspense. The disjointed screenplay doesn't know what it really wants to show us. Yes, we all know the secret identity of Mr. Hyde (here arsonist and murderer) from the beginning, but that doesn't mean the writer can dispense with suspense in telling the story. Instead of focusing and developing the story of ""Jekyll & Hyde,"" the film spends so much time on flashbacks and supporting characters (including a gossipy lady, a sleazy reporter and even Jekyll's father played by Lionel Jeffries) which are all unnecessary. In fact, the film's credits say it has ""derived from"" the original story, and I can understand why they used this expression.

Even worse than the inconsistent script and misguided direction of writer/director David Wickes is the terrible make-up of Mr. Hyde, which makes him so conspicuous among the Victorians that the detectives from Scotland Yard (including Kevin McNally, regular of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise) start to look stupid, always unable to catch this culprit roaming in the street.

I like Michael Caine (nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe for the role he played here), and he turns in a strong performance as a tormented doctor, but the film itself remains uninvolving throughout.",1233014400,5,1919,4.97196261682243
802672,4,6304178891,"Michael Caine plays Dr. Jekyll, and he doesn't disappoint.  He is a more mature doctor, which is closer in line to Stevenson's original.

Since John Barrymore's silent film, Hollywood has added the female element to the story. (The original story has no female ""romance"" at all.  The only females are servants, passer-bys, a little child, and all the main characters are un-married men.)

Cheryl Ladd plays the sister of Dr. Jekyll's deceased wife.  Her father is Dr. Lanyon, and because he blames Henry Jekyll for his daughter's death-although she died of pnuemonia, for which there was no cure at the time, there is an added element of dissention between them.

With an actress as attractive as Cheryl Ladd, there is of course a romance that develops between her and Michael Caine.  But it does not detract from the story.  In fact it adds a layer of humanity to Dr. Jekyll.  Jekyll becomes a happier individual not only in the scenes with her, but also in the relationship with his medical students whom he lectures.

But of course Mr Hyde eventually takes over the personality of Jekyll.
The special effects of the transformation are more graphic than other versions.  This Hyde is a more deformed creature than his processors.  His violence and depravity is also more evident.

There is a surprise ending too, which is in line with the story.

If I took off a point it was only for the graphic depictions of Mr. Hyde. I suppose the argument could be debated that the director David Wicks wanted to show the complete opposite of the gentle Dr. Jekyll, but the sea of broken necks and backs left in Mr. Hyde's wake can be a bit much at times.

Overall, an excellent adaptation and one that should be of interest to fans of the Jekyll/Hyde canon.",1097107200,,1748,4.685245901639345

Cheryl Ladd does a credible performance as Sarah Crawford, and the late great Lionel Jeffries (his last film?) provideds excellent character support (and subtle comic relief) as Henry Jekyll's father.

As a Louisiana high school educator, I show this film to students in my Psychology classes so that they may see an appropriate, graphic depiction of how easy it is for drugs to control the mind and body.  For me, this is not a story about the evil desires of man, but, rather, the hapless plight of a well-meaning researcher who becomes an addict.",1258243200,5,685,4.788135593220339

Hot Toasty Rag, December 2, 2017

I don't know how many versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theyve made, or how many youve seen, but Id never seen it before I watched the Michael Caine version. I didn't even know it was going to be a horror movie, so I was in for quite a surprise!

Besides the blackouts that signal an impending commercial break, theres no other indication that this was a television movie. The acting is very good and the production values and costumes are beautiful. Immediately at the opening credits, you're immersed in the world of 1800s England. Michael Caine plays the respected Dr. Jekyll, and when he saves the life of a little girl, you're sure of two things: hes the good guy in the story, and hell be cast as the iconic Dr. Larch nine years later in The Cider House Rules. Michael is ostracized from his father-in-law, Joss Ackland, who believes his experimentation in alternative medicine killed his daughter, and to make matters even more complicated, hes falling in love with his sister-in-law Cheryl Ladd!

Where does the scary part come in, you ask? Well, youll have to watch the movieor already know the very famous Robert Louis Stevenson storyto find out. Definitely put the kids to bed before watching this version, though, because its pretty spooky. Depending on how much you love him, it can be tough to watch Michael Caine in those scenes, but just keep telling yourself its a movie and not real lifeand then watch Hannah and Her Sisters afterwards. Cheryl Ladd is incredibly beautiful, and she and the other ladies in the film get to wear absolutely gorgeous gowns, designed by Raymond Hughes. Theres also a pretty strong supporting cast, which is always a nice surprise in a tv movie, including David Schofield as the slimy reporter, Miriam Karlin as the corrupt brothel owner, and Frank Barrie as the handsome butler.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since it's a horror movie, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1512172800,,2021,4.749287749287749

7863994,3,6304178891,Entertaining movie with a different twist.  I still prefer the 1941 version whose special effects were great. I didn't like the special effects used in this version changing Michael Caine into Mr. Hyde. But the movie was interesting.,1478131200,,233,5.131578947368421

But - Michael Caine is - as usual - as amazing as this awful script will allow him to be.

John Barrymore, Fredric March and Spencer Tracy have all played the good (and bad) doctor but I particularly enjoyed this Michael Caine version. It is a split with tradition. Caine and Cheryl Ladd have turned it into a tragic love story as penned by David Wickes. Its still scary, the duplicity of human nature theme remains in tact but the characters are more appealing.
