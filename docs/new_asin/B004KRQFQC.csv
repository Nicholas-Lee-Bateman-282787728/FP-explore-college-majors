8433357,5,B004KRQFQC,"This live DVD has its place in my collection
I must say I don't play it often
I regard it as ""perfect elevator jazz''
It can get a bit tiring but all my musio friends lock into it whenever they visit
She is an amazing guitarist but its not one I 'can't wait to throw on every time I get home'
What ever . . . it takes a lot of music to cover all my moods and tastes",1348444800,,365,3.632911392405063
8433358,4,B004KRQFQC,"My copy of this DVD had defective audio (frequent popping sounds throughout), but what I could hear of it was excellent.  Got a refund, but am reluctant to order another copy since another reviewer on this page mentions that he had no audio on his copy.",1318982400,,253,4.5
8433359,2,B004KRQFQC,I'm familiar with Mimi's wonderful playing but was disappointed in this DVD. The audio for the performances and interview would not play. There was audio in the intro part but that's it. I ordered a replacement and had the same problem. Must be a bad batch. I had to send that one back too and request a refund. First time I've experienced this with a product from Amazon.com.,1311033600,,376,4.544117647058823
8433360,5,B004KRQFQC,"I have all the guitar DVDs...all of them.  I too have been bored to death by some really great guitar players and Mel Bay's yaaaawn productions.

Also have plenty great stuff.  Scofield. Stern. Hall etc etc.  Watch once or twice, love, come back in a year.

With this, I have to keep coming back.  VERY very creative..... What? ? I can hear the wood in her guitar.  I can hear her femininity.  She tears the house down.

Great (and I mean great) support from Akira Tana and Chris Enghauser.  Hats off to TrueFire for a really great production.

Edit 5/12/12 I'm still listening to this thing.  The audio is amazing to me, I don't know what happened to the other reviewers DVDs.  Akira keeps blowing my mind and Chris is a perfect compliment.",1301702400,3,741,4.481203007518797
8433361,5,B004KRQFQC,"I first saw Mimi in a performance on B.E.T. some years ago. (I sure wish *that* show were available on dvd.) When I saw that this dvd had been released, I didn't hesitate. While I've really enjoyed her last studio outing, ""Perpetually Hip"", I knew from the B.E.T. show that her live presentation has a lot more energy. She does not disappoint in the least here.

Mimi opens the show with ""Blues For 2"" and ""Stella By Starlight"". Both tracks are superb, although they feel like the band's just getting warmed up. By the time they hit Mimi's own ""Pack Of Lies"", the show is in full swing (no pun intended). For me the highlight of the show are the back-to-back punches of ""Polka Dots and Moonbeams"" (an elegant Fox solo piece) followed by Charlie Parker's barn burner ""Yardbird Suite"". She follows that with another ballad, ""My Romance"", in which she plays an opening melody line using right hand harmonics. Great stuff. And finally, the band's rendition of ""Caravan"" is not to be missed. One of the better versions I've heard. - ""Lullaby Of The Leaves"" beautifully closes the set.

The complete song list is as follows: (since I get the pleasure of being first to review this!)

Blues For 2
Stella By Starlight
Pack Of Lies
Roses In January
Triste
Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Yardbird Suite
My Romance
Caravan
Lullaby Of The Leaves

This is a no-frills trio performance. Although I wouldn't call her an innovator, Fox is a tremendous player. If you're looking for a great live jazz show, look no further... a guaranteed winner. (And it's criminally cheap too. Can't figure that one.)

For those of you asking, ""Yeah... It's so cheap... It must be a crappy production, right?"" I'm no video/audiophile, but I own a good handful of live jazz dvd's. The production on this one is well above what I've seen previously. Admittedly I don't have HD TV or surround sound stereo, but the picture is *sharp*; the camera angles, directing and editing are all really good (lots of great shots watching Mimi play). The audio also seems to be excellent. I just have basic stereo speakers hooked up to my TV, and the separation and clarity of the instruments is very good. I'd love to hear this on a better system than my own.

My only criticism of this dvd (and it's minor) is the show is not presented as a continuous performance. All the songs are separated... As soon as a song ends, the audience begins to cheer and is faded out, screen fades to black, and then the next scene fades in just before the start of the next song. I personally like the energy of a live show. I enjoy the musician banter between songs, the energy of the crowd, the anticipation of what's coming next... Not a huge complaint. I just wonder why they put it together like that.

The only other thing I noticed, and it could just be me, is I feel like Mimi is a bit too prominent in the mix. (Just a hair) No complaints really. I've purchased other dvd's where the feature soloist is somewhat buried... That's a far worse crime.

Anyway... Thanks for reading. Now go buy this!",1300579200,3,3035,4.5661764705882355
