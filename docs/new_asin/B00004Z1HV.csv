7927870,3,B00004Z1HV,"Is the question of how music should accompany film pertinent to avant-gardists anymore?  To art films ranging from <La Belle et la Bete> to <Koyaanisqatsi> and <Baraka>, add this roughly 14-minute film of four short pieces attempting to adjoin contemporary architecture and electronic music.  Director Iara Lee's strategy is to juxtapose kaleidoscopic, multi-perspectival architectural images and the electronic, computer-generated, noisist, experimental music of Taylor Deupree, Savvas Ysatis, Tetsu Inoue, David Toop, and Panacea.  As ambitious as that might sound, I'm left with the uneasy feeling that I've seen it before, down to the last arbitrary interface of musical and architectural geometricity.  Even though there are sublime glimpses in the longer pieces: ""Towers of Wind,"" about Toyo Ito's Yokohama tower, and ""Terminal Happiness,"" about Nicholas Grimshaw's Waterloo Terminal, there's too much pretentious ""trying"" here.",979516800,,934,6.0
