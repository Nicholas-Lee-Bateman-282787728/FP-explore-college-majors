7697416,5,B01D55W5KY,"There are good documentaries and there are great documentaries, and ""Fear of 13"" is simply great in almost every respect. This is simply one extremely articulate and listenable death-row inmate Nick Yarris, telling his harrowing life story, including many years of  false-imprisonment after being wrongfully convicted of murder, in a staged prison-cell like environment. There are few distractions and re-creations are done in a very brief, distinctive and artistic style, reminiscent of Errol Morris. In other words don't expect to see gruesome real-life crime photos or  interviews with the various people in this man's lifetime. You see and hear only him for the better part of ninety-five minutes, and it is nothing short of riveting viewing. Documentarian David Sington could have stooped to a lot of tricks with this movie. He could have also made it tough viewing, as some of the events in Nick's life are truly nasty, but wisely and with respect for the viewer, he allows Nick to tell his story and let the viewer paint whatever images come to mind. Unrated. Contains some strong language and descriptions of events that some viewers might find disturbing.",1464739200,6,1164,5.1534391534391535
7697417,5,B01D55W5KY,"Nick Yarris was convicted of a horrible crime and sentenced to death  this is his story. It is basically Nick telling the story of his life to camera and mostly done in a chronological fashion. There is some re enactment of his past life as a child but that is a small part of the film.

For a film that basically just has one man talking to the camera for the majority of the time, this is incredibly powerful.  It is an amazing, sad and moving story and I challenge anyone not to be moved by it. I watched it over a week ago and have only just decided to write a review to see if the film had lost any of its potency and nope it has not.

To say any more runs the risk of spoiling the story so I will demur, this is recommended to anyone who appreciates the uniqueness that real life can portray and who appreciate quality in their film making.",1461110400,9,846,4.078313253012048
8754905,4,B01D55W5KY,"Sammy Silverwatch was great as the lead actor.  The movie was presented as a convincing documentary, even though it wasn't.  Singer Van Hunt's rendition of ""Common Man"" and ""Misty Blue"" showcased this young man's incredible talent.  WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1537401600,,250,5.358974358974359
8754906,4,B01D55W5KY,"I don't generally review Documentaries, but sometimes a documentary comes along that is so compelling, people need to know about it. The Fear of 13 is the biography of a man, that most of us have never heard of, Nicholas Yarris. His was one of the first cases taken on by the Innocence Project and he is a prime example of not only the system failing to help someone, but a reason that it should scare the hell out of you. Yarris wasn't a great guy, when he was pulled over in the wrong place at the wrong time. Given his criminal history and inability to pay for a proper defense, Yarris was the perfect target for an over zealous District Attorney. Despite being based on completely circumstantial evidence, Yarris was convinced of murder and sentenced to death row. His life was troubled on the outside, but what happened in prison made it seem like a walk in the park. For twenty years, Yarris's cries fell on deaf ears, and it wasn't until he gave up and said, just kill me already, that someone finally noticed him. Nicholas Yarris's story is the kind of thing you can't make up and someday, I'd love to see a movie version of it. This man was never considered innocent and he wasn't proven guilty, yet he was forced to endure government sanctioned torture, the likes of which we couldn't possibly imagine. This is an eye opening documentary that must be seen by all and afterwards it may just change your opinion on our criminal justice system.",1495238400,,1451,4.520912547528517
8754907,5,B01D55W5KY,I saw this on Netflix. I was reluctant to watch it because I expected it to be terribly depressing. I was wrong. It was a very dark story but also one of the most beautiful and life affirming things I've ever seen. Listening to him speak about his experiences was incredibly moving. It's crazy to think that death row could produce such a beautiful mind and great soul. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.,1489622400,2,415,4.473684210526316
8754908,5,B01D55W5KY,"This man has a wonderful way of telling the sad events in his life, but his tragedy created a strength in him.  His years in pain were not totally in vain, for he is able to give to others by telling his story.  He inspired me so much and I keep recommending this book to my family and friends.",1479254400,,294,3.9661016949152543
8754909,5,B01D55W5KY,"I thought this was wonderful. The simplicity of the visuals did not detract from what I felt was a beautifully told story from the inmate's perspective. Nick Yarris was endearing, not because he was wrongfully imprisoned but because of his authenticity as a flawed human with a special talent for sharing details in the stories of his life. I loved it.",1472169600,,352,4.786885245901639

8754912,2,B01D55W5KY,Not as exciting as other reviews stated.,1468627200,,40,4.857142857142857
8754913,1,B01D55W5KY,This thing was boring. Just a guy telling his story while they put photos and video mixed in. Not actual photos or videos just reenactments. If you want my copy just send me your address and I'll mail it to you. There is no reason you should spend your money on this. I did and I regret the time and money I lost to learn this Mans boring story.,1468195200,,345,4.0144927536231885
8754914,3,B01D55W5KY,"I don't really know what to say about this film.  I know a lot about prison nightmarish stuff that he describes going on inside walls where the guards get away with more than anyone would believe.  I understand that there are probably many inmates who are innocent, but imprisoned due to a number of factors.",1465084800,,308,4.581818181818182
