8182354,5,B000NXH39A,"Very real, hurtful video, it will really make you think about yourself, parents, grandparents and other relatives in a different light.
The blotted spot of hatred and oppression has a long mark of horrors that remains to this day. Even if you were or are a model citizen now the pain of the past does not escape, even you. A must read for all Americans, you will see enslavement through a new prism of it continuing harm on the American society.",1404259200,,445,4.506172839506172
8182355,5,B000NXH39A,Details and speaks of something that the public is not ready to talk about but know that it exists so the powers that be just keep keeping it under the rug but it's real issue that needs to be addressed in a public forum on a world platform,1388793600,,240,4.020833333333333
8182356,5,B000NXH39A,"Clear and concise! A MUST READ! A true classic! If you've never read any books on why black people are the way that they are, you must get this book. All the the reasons are right there.",1372032000,2,186,4.054054054054054

8182359,4,B000NXH39A,"I really enjoyed Joy DeGruy Leary's speech, and have used it in classes that I teach on diversity.  While I don't agree with all of our facts, I do agree with her major premise regarding the enduring legacy of slavery and the importance of all Americans understanding that legacy.",1337558400,3,280,4.714285714285714
8182360,5,B000NXH39A,This DVD should be a must see for every High School student in the United States.

8182361,5,B000NXH39A,"Dr. DeGruy presents a cogent analysis of ""Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome"" based on DSM-IV's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. As a teacher (and one of color), I had witnessed behaviors that I could not account for and Dr. DeGruy's theories helped me understand the complexity and effects of slavery and Jim Crow and its residual effects on the African-American populace. Learned behaviors do not simply vanish because the original stimuli (slavery and Jim Crow) are no longer part of our social fabric. This video and her accompanying book are required viewing and reading.",1316822400,7,570,5.206521739130435
8182362,4,B000NXH39A,"This video is absolutely everything that African Americans should see, know and begin to understand.  I was so moved by the presentation that I had to purchase a copy to share with my friends.  WE need to know!",1301616000,3,210,4.5
