Though reading gives us the opportunity to use our imaginations, film gives us the opportunity to see superb acting and directing, giving us the directors take on characters, attire, and setting etc.  This was another wonderful film that like a good book would, took me there.  ...and I hope to one day catch up on my reading, which will also help me with my spelling and grammar. ;)",1477353600,,526,4.5638297872340425

848534,4,630429185X,"Riotously hilarious.  Moll is a very likeable character, even though she turns out to be a scoundrel...and the type of woman that many would be should they be so fortunately.  Alas, the series is sensationally unbelievable, but a good story all the same.  I like this and laughed so hard throughout, but can easily see how others would not.",1469923200,2,340,4.728813559322034

848641,5,630429185X,"I originally watched this when it aired on PBS in the 1990s and  loved it so much that I spent a large chunk of time trying to figure out how to get a (VHS!!) copy here in the US. When our local PBS station gave it away as part of their pledge drive, I was in heaven. Since I no longer own a VCR, I was very excited to find the digital copy available on Amazon.

The story follows the ups and downs of a woman who does anything and everything she can to survive and occasionally thrive. Moll is a thief, a wife, a servant, a whore, a mother, an abandoner of children, etc. She is sometimes ""good"" and often ""bad"" but you are always invested in her survival, even at the times that you don't like her very much. In a weird way, she reminds me of Scarlet O'Hara from Gone with the Wind, but with a lot more downtrodden moments. There are quite a few mature themes throughout the series, so some people may wish to supervise if they have any children that are interested in watching this miniseries.

Alex Kingston's acting is amazing and really draws you into the character and it's a fun surprise to realize that a young Daniel Craig plays one of the pivotal characters.",1458777600,10,1169,4.256756756756757

A fun frolic through ups and downs (ahem) of a resilient heroine's life -- so much better than the feature film with Kim Novak, and quite faithful to the book.  Gorgeous costumes, many R-rated scenes, and an intelligent proxy ride on the great Wheel of Fortune.",1439856000,,355,4.709677419354839

848851,5,630429185X,"Very good movie and very interesting.  It tells of the time in England around 1710 of a story written by Daniel Defoe, of Robinson Crusoe fame.  It is an all English cast and that makes a period movie that much better.",1416268800,,218,4.2926829268292686

848853,4,630429185X,"Great costumes, sets, and a treat for the eyes. This is a light-hearted romp and not your typical costume-drama-with-social-tensions romance, some of which is due to the novel appearing long before the Victorian and Regency periods, from which most of the marriage-plot stories  originate. Has humor and some forays into the seedy side of life like the Dickens' adaptations, but even more focus is on the fun. Alex Kingston is luminous and acts with the precise amount of wit and sympathy, such that we grow to love the character. Supporting characters get the job done, but depth of character won't be found here, as their job is to keep the plot moving.",1398816000,,655,4.848214285714286
848854,5,630429185X,"It is a very enjoyable series, and gives you a feel for what times were like back then.  It doesn't show the entire story from the novel, however, like most movies.

848856,5,630429185X,"This is a creepy, weird, funny, sad tale of a poor girl's life. It has so many twists and turns that there is no way you will ever get bored. There are no subtitles, so it may be a bit hard to follow at times. Add to that the horrible American accents and you may feel frustrated. Keep watching! It's worth it. This is not the type of period piece you are used to. The acting is fine. The storytelling is fun. It's a great time.",1394928000,,428,3.988372093023256
848857,4,630429185X,"Though the story line was somewhat altered for this series, most of the major aspects were included. (Though not necessarily in the right order.)  However, some aspects were definitely changed, such as the nature of the ending.

The various productions of Moll over the years have been of course somewhat censored. However, this version is probably the most true to the bawdy nature of the subject and the times, and the talented Alex Kingston has both the right look and sensuality to play a convincing Moll.",1393113600,,509,4.906976744186046

848942,5,630429185X,Almost any thing with Alex Kingston is fantastic. She was born to be Moll Flanders! We love her on Dr. Who! Don't like her recurring character on the current Arrow TV show. They have straightened her hair and attempted an American accent. I see no reason why they must tone down her British Accent or straighten her hair. She is beautiful and a terrific actor.,1386374400,,360,4.553846153846154
848943,5,630429185X,"Great series.  Alex Kingston is believeable as Moll Flanders.  This is very hard to find online anywhere to download so I had to buy it to see part 2.  Not disappointed.  This version of DeFoe's classic is one of the better ones with the English actors and authentic English interiors, dress, and wigs.  Daniel Craig is another added bonus also.  He looks better as a gentleman of the 1700's than a boob of the 21st Century in the 007 series.  He is more believeable in this movie by far.",1385856000,2,488,4.415730337078652
848944,4,630429185X,"The storyline was great. Alex Kingston is amazing as Moll and really brings the role to life. The show was one of my first experiences with Masterpiece Theater, and I really liked the intervals of interaction with the viewer(s). There are multiple scenes with nudity and/or sexual content, so if that sort of stuff bothers you, this is not a show for you.",1375574400,,355,4.650793650793651
848945,5,630429185X,"Period dramas are my favorite and this one was my first love!

During a time period when women had no rights, Moll Flanders fends for herself through constant reversals in fortune and luck.  The director's finesse and Alex Kingston's audacious acting make this incredibly delightful!  Sex abounds in this story!  Alex Kingston (as Moll) as a giddy, nave, and sexually overcharged servant girl is riotous in her first encounters with sex and puppy love.  As she experiences a few hard knocks, we see her shift to a more cunning and calculating figure enchanted with her own personal power.  More reversals in fortune lead her back to her true and happy self.  She then learns a terrible secret which sends her round the wheel of fortune again.  Back at the bottom, she must shift for herself again but, this time, it is in a darker, more painful way.  And so the story continues with more twists and turns.  Moll Flanders is an ever changing mood ring and Alex Kingston's acting is stunning.  Such complexity, wit, humor, warmth, despair with always a glimmer of hope that fortune will shine upon Moll again!

Just a brilliant adaptation!  And SOOOOO FUN!

(p.s. the original TV version had some addition scenes I do miss)",1372723200,4,1221,4.779904306220096
848946,5,630429185X,"It's always a hit or miss, watching a film adaptation of a book you love. Some movies get it perfect (or even better) while others fall way short. Moll Flanders is the former. Part of it's success, I believe is the format. A 4 hour miniseries, there is much more time to develop Moll's character, her relationship with other characters, and tell her story while staying as close to Defoe's plot as possible. Kingston gives a fantastic performance, guiding her Moll from blushing virgin to bawdy wife and  cynical thief. She adds a rawness, particularly toward the end, that brings home the tragedy of Moll's life up until the point she is released from Newgate Prison. I also particularly like the narrative quality the film takes as Moll often breaks the fourth wall to engage with the viewer. At times it's uncomfortable, having Moll turn toward the camera with a simple glance or throwaway line, challenging the viewer to find fault with herself or her actions, but there is something to be said with that uncomfortable nature. The nature of the prison system in seventeenth century England make prisoner's into spectacles, their actions into fascinating tales, their punishement into amusing events. In short, ""Moll Flanders"" has many layers to it, and while it may be enjoyed as a stand alone movie, I would encourage viewer to watch it in conjuncture with reading the book. The two play off of each other well, and one deepens the meaning of the other.",1370390400,3,1458,4.832

848948,5,630429185X,"Better than the American Version. Moll Flanders has been through it all. Used and used by others. Its frightening how shoplifters and thieves are subjected to capital punishment.

There is no information on the BFS website about the aspect ratio of the transfer. The original is widescreen (1:66 or 1:78). The BFS transfer is, if Amazon is accurate (not always the case, by the way) 1:33. So if you don't mind missing a significant part of the show buy it. As for me I will stick with the ITV release in the correct oar I purchased some time back and will remain annoyed by the BFS tradition of not telling consumers anything about the oar on the packages or website and of and transforming a widescreen film or TV programme into a TV screen box oar.

849149,5,630429185X,"Alex Kingston (E.R.) portrays Moll Flanders as a hip, somewhat unsophisticated knowing victim of changes on a roller coaster ride through early 18th Century society. We see Moll transformed from a young orphan girl exploited by gypsy's to rise to the fringe of high class England then down to the streets as an infamous thief to eventually the gallow's pole.  All the while in and out of the bedrooms of men who she never cared for and the man she cared for the most.  Fabulous cast, performances and truly the best set coordination ever  depicting the era.  Costuming and props that make you almost believe they are there.  Alex's Moll is energetic and optimistic but always the cynic and boiled in sarcasm.  I prefer this to the somewhat droll Hollywood version made a few years later HANDS DOWN.  Ms. Kingston's Moll survives the trials and tribulations of her circumstances by guile and will and with a striking beauty not seen in her other characters.

From a novel that set the standard for romance novels to come in its wake this tale is filled to overflowing with adventure, danger, heart rending romance all compounded by delicious plot twists and harrowing encounters.
  Heading the cast is Alex Kingston as the sexy, ambitious Moll Flanders. She pulls us into the story with sly asides that endear, tease and at times challenge us with ""What would you do?""  Miss Kingston carries the film with grace and a steely resolve that is admirable in scope as well as intimate nuance. She is in short a magnificent actress and a treat to watch.

  Diana Rigg as Mrs. Golightly gives us a thoroughly marvelous depiction of a hard-bitten rough colonial American woman who is as pragmatic as any pioneer in the New World. And like most of those who came out from England to Virginia she brings with her a secret that turns the plot and Moll completely around. It is great to see her in this film having a grand time in a fun role.

  Daniel Craig is perfectly cast as James Seagrave the rouge 17th century bad boy supreme turned highwayman and the great tragic love of Moll Flanders. He has the kind of rough good looks with his crinkly wicked smile, sky blue laughing eyes and devil on the town attitude the part demands. He is the kind of guy designed by fate to be Satan's sexy trap for any unsuspecting innocent. His first appearance in the film as Moll arrives by coach to London sells his whole character persona in a flash. He pops his head into her coach and gives her a playfully wicked, promising how do you do smile and then is gone not to appear for another hour in the story. But Mr. Craig makes this a memorable screen entrance and in the doing puts anticipation for what will happen next on the razors edge. He does not disappoint in this early in his career performance and shows just why his talent and role choices have brought him to the top of his field today.

  The whole film is a romp and a joy as it creates an entire world centuries past yet carries the ageless truth of what lies ahead in a young life is forever exciting, fresh and doomed to be repeated by each new generation.",1233792000,5,2325,4.470449172576832

849283,4,630429185X,"My main complaint with this film is the annoying music that really dates the production as well as the production quality itself.  For a movie that is only ten years old it looks like it was filmed in 1975. It is too bad because it really is entertaining. It is fun to watch a period film that is in no way stuffy, centered around a woman with modern sensibilities. This was a time when a woman who was on her own had very few avenues to explore, and the majority of those were not respectable.  Moll has a fiery personality and does not settle for the safe roads. She's cut-throat and ruthless, but you will like her anyway, because she does it all with the utmost charm and a twinkle in her eye. She could have invented the field of public relations. There is a lot of nudity and sex in this but it doesn't seem risque since it is all done with a certain comical edge. In fact most of the film is done lightheartedly even though you are dealing with some touchy subjects. One last downfall -- It makes me sound extremely shallow, but I just don't see Alex Kingston as the beauty that Moll is supposed to be. Using her supposed stunning beauty to work her way through life, and manipulate nearly every man she meets is simply difficult to believe when you don't find the actress to be so beautiful. Other than that the story is very entertaining with all it's twists and turns. If you like it, you should also watch ""Vanity Fair"" with Natasha Little.  It is another period film with a naughty anti-heroin, who you will love to hate. P.S. This Moll Flanders is ten times more fun than the Robin Wright/ Morgan Freeman version which really has very little in common with this production aside from centering around a like minded heroin in the same time period.",1190246400,,1759,4.406153846153846

Moll Flanders is among my favorite books of all. (If you don't believe me, check out my review of it.) Purists might object that this 1996 film version strays a bit from the original, but as is the case in some other rare instances (the 1991 motion picture version of The Last of the Mohicans, for instance) it actually enhances the tale in so doing therefore the sacrifice of authenticity is more or less worth it. What is shocking about this production, which aired on PBS's Masterpiece Theater back in the `90's, is the extent to which the filmmakers chose to focus less on Moll as a survivor against all odds and more on those erotic elements left understated by Defoe. Here by my estimate perhaps one in four scenes in the movie contain both nudity and sex: sometimes downright raunchy, rutting-like-beasts-in-heat sort of sex, too. It blows my mind how back in those happier days of the 1990's, before that dictatorial anachronism that is the FCC was quite so draconian about flexing its Puritanical muscle, this version of Moll Flanders actually aired in prime time. As I said up there in my title: WOW! Don't see the Robin Wright Penn adaptation that misguidedly sets this story in the 1700's instead of the 1600's, see this one. Or better yet, read the book. It's truly great literature.",1159574400,5,1457,4.651162790697675

This edit loses at least one scene (the garden scene with Moll and Roland in the strange, circular shrubbery) and some of the narration is either missing or moved.  The result is a different product.  The time gained by losing a scene (or more) and narration is spent in adding graphic sex scenes for nearly EVERYONE Moll sleeps with (yes, even the disgusting, drunken baronet, but thankfully, his pasty bottom is one of the few that isn't shown in the act).  Why this edit adds so many more sex scenes and then does not add any new scenes or retain the old scenes is beyond my understanding.  This edit results in a less satisfying story.

  If that were not enough, the music is changed for this version.  After a while, you can get used to it, but it is a much sweeter soundtrack and often doesn't seem to go that well with the scene as a result.

Carrying every scene, portraying the best and absolute worst in human character, and even breaking the fourth wall and narrating directly into the camera without once shattering the suspension of disbelief, Kingston simply awes.

The humanity of Moll keeps it from becoming a hopeless parade of cynicism - but just barely. The spoiler-laden title of Defoe's novel gives away this downward spiral: ""The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders Who Was Born in Newgate, and During a Life of Continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, Besides Her Childhood, Was Twelve Year a Whore, Five Times a Wife [Whereof Once To Her Own Brother], Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon In Virginia, at Last Grew Rich, Liv'd Honest, and Died a Penitent.""

Alex Kingston performs superbly as the lead performance of Moll Flanders: our sexy, lusty and resourceful heroine. She is a woman who grows up with a strong passion for sexual enjoyment, looking for the best and richest of all men. When she marries them, she serves them with sexual pleasures. Usually, her husbands die, so she is left with their fortune. Daniel Craig is Moll's greatest love, Jemmy Seagrave. Originally, she meant to do the same thing with him: gain power and become a grand gentlewoman. However, as Moll says in the finished film, ""Jemmy spoke to my heart, and to other parts too."" There are many sex scenes in this BBC film, and many people call them repetitive. However, if you watch the movie, and listen to Moll when she turns to the camera and speaks to you, you will find that the sexual interaction only adds to the personal nature of the film. There is one thing I want to know about this special edition DVD set. The following is my question: does this edition of the BBC film include the extra sequences like in the UK video release? I saw this Moll Flanders on PBS and there was some scenes I didn't see after buying it on video. I really wish somebody would tell me if those scenes are on this DVD... One of these extra sequences is a shot of Jemmy and Moll on their wedding night of Jemmy kissing Moll's breasts. On the VHS version I own, this breast-kissing shot is replaced with a shot of Moll holding up her arm and then Jemmy running his hand down it and holding her breasts. I really prefer the breast-kissing as it was the shot I originally saw when I first saw this film. Someone tell me if that is on this DVD!!
Overall, this movie is probably one of my favourite movies of all time. Every genre comes together to make a mastepiece! Every frame is amazing! Not a single scene is boring! A real treat for all!",1038614400,7,1957,4.364383561643836

I have already wrote my positive review of this program on the no longer available one double sided disc copy, so I won't repeat myself. Go there if you wanna see my commentary (not to mention that Amazon sold it to me for borscht at the time I wrote it :-).) The only plus this 2 disc copy may have is that the credit crunches from my copy on the WGBH (Anchor Bay) label will be removed (opening credits on part 2 slightly crunched, and closing credits for both halves are back to back at end of side 2) and well the DVD rom novel, but that to me is no big deal. My copy (the fore mentioned 1 disc version) also includes something you don't find usually on pre-records (disc or tape) of Masterpiece Theater shows, Russell Baker's opening and closing commentaries. I even actually like the way they ""merged"" his closing of part one into his opening on part 2 at the beginning of side 2. So I don't know what (other than above mentioned) differences this new 2 single sided disc version will have, so I will just say to y'all, see my other review. It's a great show, much better than the theatrical release of the same year (1996), but is definitely not meant for the kiddies. Parental discretion advised. :-).

The costumes, settings, etc. are fabulous and accurate and comparable to other Masterpiece dramas on DVD such as the recently released WIVES AND DAUGHTERS.
Moll Flanders (played by Alex Kingston) was an incredibly resourceful woman. Daniel Defoe (author of ROBINSON CRUSOE, 1719) wrote Moll Flanders and in some respects Moll is a mirror-twin to Robinson. While Robinson battled nature Moll battled civilization. Civilization in late 16th-early 17th Century England was ragged around the edges. We hear much about slavery during this period, but life for the ordinary working-class male and female was just as ugly. Through Moll we learn just how ugly life could be and what it meant to survive,  especially for those not ""To the Manor Born"" and in some cases those who were. Poverty, illness, sexism, seduction, rape, murder--Moll sees it all. In spite of all this, Moll has her moments of gracious living, so you won't be watching a poor tattered Moll during the whole film.  Moll is elegantly dressed most of the time, and the settings for the action in this film include everything from the finest drawing rooms in Tudor style manors to a plantation house in the English colony of Virginia.
Moll marries five times, and each marriage is perfectly logical, pragmatic, and a choice she makes to survive. Moll turns to the camera in each instance and asks, ""What would you do"" much as Defoe asked the reader the same question. Her marriages face incredible odds. Her favorite beau Jemmy, played by Daniel Craig (The Ice House), surfaces over and over. Are these two star-crossed lovers or destined to be together? The end will tell.
I like Moll, and though she's been characterized as a ""bad girl"" I don't think she was at all. Moll took what she was handed and made the best of it. Moll was street smart before the term was invented. More than one of us is descended from someone who faced these incredible odds of survival. Does Moll beat the odds, you'll have to see the film to find out.  A special treat--the wonderful Diana Rigg as Mrs. Golightly.",999907200,68,2353,4.762254901960785

Although this video was made for a television series called Masterpiece Theater and aired about several years ago,the visual and 18th century costuming are carefully and elaborately detailed. I enjoy this video better because it does not leave out the seemingly uncouth and raw sexual details from Defoe's book. In fact the explicit sexual scenes do more than expose the viewer to the mature content of the story. Thus, for a made for TV movie this version contains a lot of sexually graphic scenes. They also make it clear to the audience that the movie itself was created in order to be confrontational and real.  There is no candy-coated icing as seen in many Hollywood productions.
Alex Kingston (who plays Moll), is perfect for the part because she appears as the tragic heroine who retains an air of innocence and spite at her twisted fate with men. At many points in the movie, she reveals her buxomness, beauty, naivete, strength, and capacity for wickedness.  You learn to love, despise, and pity her throughout the movie. I also like the ending better on this one because it's closer (while not exactly the same) to the story, as opposed to the poorly dramatized Hollywood version of the movie.

Also because the acting, direction, staging was nearly perfect.  This kind of historical/literary production is fast becoming a lost art.  Boo hoo.",1523750400,,307,5.333333333333333

The book is so much better, even without chapters. Daniel Craig is only in about 30 minutes of the movie, so if you are really wanting to see him, he's not in most of this; but Alex Kingston is fabulous in what she was given to work with here.  The movie is entertaining and at times funny, certainly dramatic and performances & production are good. It's disappointing that there is not a movie to date (that I know of) that truly captures the torment of Flander's life and struggle to survive,  and reflective about the kinds of lives women led back then. Moll's story is appalling, disgusting, frustrating ...I highly recommend reading the book after seeing this for a fluffy teaser. Just don't expect the same content.",1523404800,,850,4.697986577181208

7868482,5,630429185X,"I have owned this video for years; it's absolutely the best rendition of the story.  As with the book, it's a laugh out loud tail of immorality that comes from a life of no choices. Alex Kingston and Daniel Craig are both great, but we actually see ""Jemmy"" (Daniel Craig) in few, but critical scenes.",1520726400,,300,4.454545454545454
