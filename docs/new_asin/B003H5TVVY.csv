8396719,4,B003H5TVVY,"This DVD is exactly the same as the ""Strange Fruit"". The only difference is the cover, so if you have that DVD save your money for one of the other Lady Day DVDs. The ""Ultimate Collection"" is a good choice. The quality of the videos on this ""new"" collecton vary, of course, but it's Lady Day on video. Listening to her is always a treat but to see her perform is wonderful. The only reason for the 4 stars is because it is, as I said, the same as another set.",1280707200,9,459,4.054945054945055
