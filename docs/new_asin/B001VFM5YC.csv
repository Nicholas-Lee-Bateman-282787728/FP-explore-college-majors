8346235,5,B001VFM5YC,"Great price, DVDs are new, plays flawless. Good series. Japanese with english subtitles. I didn't look if there was english dub, but I don't look for dub'd anime.",1410825600,,162,4.821428571428571
8346236,5,B001VFM5YC,"As advertised, it's quality was good. Since I knew this story Anime was as I expected. Home was much cuter than the comic. Original ""blood of life"" became ""fire of life"". I liked it more than the original comic but I want to watch stories to the end.",1351123200,,250,4.229166666666667
8346237,4,B001VFM5YC,I made two mistakes when I bought this collection. It is the second of two sets and it is only available in Japanese with subtitles. I hate reading subtitles and my japanese language skills are limited. Maybe I will think better of it when my understanding of Japanese language improves.,1250467200,5,287,4.76
