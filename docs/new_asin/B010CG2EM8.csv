7307330,4,B010CG2EM8,"Anna Shields stars as Emma in this character study that Fields wrote and co-directed. Emma is a young woman who works at an adult store (that sells movies and toys). Her mornings consist of waking up, fighting with her coffee machine, smoking, brushing her teeth, and feeding her dog. Many of her evenings involve dealing with a variety of customers, from a man with obvious psychological difficulties to underage teens to a man who is silent until she speaks, at which point he interrupts her to complain. When she is not at the store, she engages in a variety of hookups with men and women (hence the title, though I should note that the title also refers to the fact that she dresses up in various costumes as part of her job).

The movie is more a character study than a plot-driven film. What plot there is involves Mason, a pre-op transsexual who seems to be everything that Emma desires. As the back of the box says, he might be ""her knight in shining armor."" But Emma's existence throughout the film seems predicated on revealing as little of herself to others as is possible and lying about herself in order to facilitate her hookups. With Mason, it appears that this approach might doom Emma's chances at happiness.

I liked the film for a few reasons. One is that despite the prominence of the work setting (i.e., the adult store), the film does not devolve into salaciousness or prurient exploitation. That's not to say that there aren't adult themes or moments that parents would want to shield younger viewers from; there are, of course. But the film itself is serious and is not about exploitation or titillation. I also thought that the acting was generally quite good. Shields herself exhibits surprising personality for someone who spends about half the film trudging through the mundane life she lives. Her ennui is convincing, but when she does have the chance to show emotion, she does so well. Finally, I really liked the way that Emma responds to Mason's revelation about his status as a pre-op transsexual.

There is one more thing to note, and it involves the ending of the film. I won't give away anything, but I will note that Little Bi Peep is self-reflexive. In other words, it knows that it's a movie, and it references that fact. To me, that bit worked. For others, however, it might be frustrating, as if the world of the film is suddenly shown to be fictional and the viewers' investment in it therefore tainted.",1446336000,12,2445,4.681395348837209

I don't think that this movie was meant to be a comedy, in other words, I don't think that the viewer was supposed to laugh all the way through, like I did.  I laughed because this movie was so ridiculous and pathetic that I laughed at every scene because I just couldn't believe how bad it was.  I will give it one star for entertainment.

I usually don't give a summary of a movie when I write a review, but I WILL SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE OF WATCHING THIS BAD MOVIE.

A woman named Emma lives with her mother.  She sleeps all day, wakes up in the afternoon to struggle with a broken coffee machine and a dog who poops on the rug, smokes cigarettes and eats stale food, then gets dressed in ridiculous slutty costumes to go to work at night as a cashier in a porn shop.  (We know that the movie takes place in August of 2012, because a calendar was hanging in Emma's apartment.)

When her night of work is over, if her mother does not pick her up and take her home, then Emma goes to bars or clubs and gets drunk and sleeps with just about anyone she meets, male or female.  She sleeps with so many people that she can't remember them by just their names, so she labels them in her cellphone by their names followed by unflattering reminders such as ""the one with the mole"" or ""the one with the webbed feet"" or ""the one with the teeth"" or ""the one with the nose,"" etc.

Emma lies about everything to everyone, such as lying about her mother, about quitting smoking, and about being an artist, teacher, drummer, waitress, etc. when she only works in the porn store.  If she wanted to lie about her job, I wondered why Emma just didn't tell people that she owned the porn store, or even a chain of stores, because we never see any bosses or managers around.  Emma is obviously depressed and bored with her life, so she sleeps with endless strangers and she lies and makes up stories to try to make herself sound more interesting or successful.

There was one scene in the movie that didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.  Emma goes to a therapy session, and her therapist briefly discusses things such as Emma's father who sexually abused her.  I wondered how Emma afforded therapy.  It wasn't likely that Emma had heath insurance from her job, and it is obvious that Emma earns about minimum wage.

One night, Emma meets ""Mason with the Taped Tits.""  At a glance, it is obvious that Mason is a woman (I don't believe in labels, but she could be described as a dyke or a butch).  I couldn't believe that Emma really thought that Mason was a man.  After talking and lying for a few minutes and dancing for a few minutes, Emma throws herself at Mason, kissing wildly.  Seeing how ""easy"" Emma obviously is, Mason asks her out for dinner, meaning that they can have dinner at Mason's apartment rather than a restaurant.  Emma goes to Mason's apartment, and after a few bites of dinner, Mason tells Emma that she was ""born a female"" but has not had any surgeries to change into a man, although she is saving money for it.  Emma is shocked that Mason is a  woman, but it doesn't really matter to her, and immediately go right to bed.

Emma seems to really want a relationship with Mason (even though she labeled her in the cellphone just the way that she labeled everyone else whom she had meaningless sex with and lied about absolutely everything).  But the very next day, Mason quickly discovers how much sleeping around and lying Emma has been doing.  Mason breaks up with Emma immediately.  The movie ends by making it clear that Emma continues to work nights in the porn store and nothing else of any interest or importance happens to her for the rest of her life.  This was a very sad ending for a very bad movie.",1455148800,13,3733,4.369565217391305

7307389,5,B010CG2EM8,"I'll be frank this actually caught my interest in different ways... A young hot actress dressing up in appealing outfits, a title + display that is even quite suggestive itself, a young hot actress again(repeated). So I expected a much different film, and while there's no actual friction displayed between characters, nor do you even see Anna Shields naked at all, I'm honestly not disappointed in the least. I didn't even know Anna Shields 24 hours ago, and I still don't but I sure wanna!

The directors did an excellent job at throwing in some good foundation and keeping the story interesting, the script had excellent character habits/traits that were witty and interesting enough to consciously catch my attention, and Miss Anna Shields was a total bad ass at executing her role. Whether it be that her character shares many traits with herself or that she's just that G, she just hands down kills it. Even if the rest of the movie had been bad, (it wasn't) it'd be worth a glance or two just to catch her in action. I plan to purchase this movie and even consider this a Cult Classic by my own opinion. You can feel the great sense of humor she herself, as well as the puppet masters, must have.

Okay, so I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral, but if you an open minded or otherwise ""misunderstood"" sense of humor, that very well may be what this is + a fine babe that can act + humor that even normal people should be able to enjoy!

Her cast of characters stay true to their artistic depictions until the very end. And lastly, having the co-star and romantic lead as the emotionally mature Mason, who just happens to be transgender, is such a progressive and socially-conscious step that plays out in the film so naturally and organically-- anything other than heavy-handed.
