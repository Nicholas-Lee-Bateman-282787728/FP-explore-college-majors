7839398,5,6303152767,"I'm going to have to get this one, ""The Mayflower Voyagers"".  Always been a fan of the classic Peanuts specials (Halloween and Christmas) but had never seen this one.  It was on TV last night, following the original Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.  What a great history lesson, even for us oldsters.  Wow, and they dared to mention God and faith.  I'm so encouraged.  Highly recommended.",1227830400,,383,4.90625
7839399,1,6303152767,"""The Mayflower Voyagers"" - In this Charlie Brown special, the children appear as passengers on the Mayflower.  Most of the characters in the movie are adults and they speak, contrary to most Charlie Brown movies (which focus on the children).  In this poorly animated (why are Lucy's feet sometimes brown?) and unhappy tale, we see a lot of people throwing up (yes, throwing up), holding their mouths so they won't throw up, falling sick and dying, and generally being miserable and struggling to survive.  In the end, we find out that the Native Americans, who cleared the land the settlers claim, are thrilled to have them there, in part because so many Native peoples died of plague (they want the land to be used).  Not exactly politically correct... We see a happy scene of the pilgrims piling fish on the ground on top of their corn seeds, then praying over their Thanksgiving dinner while the Native peoples scratch their heads in bewilderment over piano playing and Snoopy on the drums.  Highlights include Linus and Charlie Brown throwing up over the side of the boat, and carrying dead people on stretchers to a graveyard of crosses.  This is a Charlie Brown special I could have done without.",1227571200,3,1203,4.815533980582524

7839401,4,6303152767,"Volume 4 of This Is America, Charlie Brown: The Mayflower Voyages takes us back to 1620.  The Peanuts gang witnesses 1st hand the long and dreary ride from England to the New Land on the Mayflower.  Charlie Brown gets seasick and Linus tells him to have faith.  Lucy quips ""A bath and a change of clothes would help too!""  When they finally land on Plymouth Rock, they endure their 1st winter.  Lucy feels the need to be in charge (""Miles Standish put me in charge because of my pretty face!""), much to Peppermint Patty's resentment.  Later, the pilgrims make friends with Samoset and Squanto, who give them agricultural advice and help them get settled into the New Land.  Ed Bogas, who composed the music for Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown, provides this volume's film score.",1016841600,7,780,4.6911764705882355
