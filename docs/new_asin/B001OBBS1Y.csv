These contain the footage seen in countless documentaries made after WW2. The German narrator is actor Harry Giese, chosen by Hitler, although he was never a Nazi Party member.

In this last episode, old men and boys take the Oath to serve in the Volkssturm, and receive a Panzerfaust. A regiment of Americans is surrounded, and we see dead U.S. soldiers in the road. Wrecked American tanks. Tiger IIs in action, with smiling soldiers riding on top. Streams of captured U.S. soldiers, many black American soldiers.

Col. Rudel in his Stuka, who destroyed more than 457 tanks. The Huertgen Forest fighting, very costly to Americans, and seldom featured in war films. See When Trumpets Fade, 1998, by John Irvin, set in the Huertgenwald. Late war armor.

You will not see these half-tracks or Panther tanks in Hollywood war films. These are real. The issuing of the first assault rifles, some still packed in the rough shipping crates. These are the StG-44/45, aka MP-43/44, based on the MKb-42. Followed by Goliath mini tanks. Amazing footage; all authentic.

Women give testimony. One says ""every woman from age of 13 to 68 was raped."" Cornelius Ryan, author of The Longest Day, also wrote about the Battle of Berlin, and has the same accounts in his book The Last Battle.

Andrei Vlasov, a brilliant Soviet general, captured after this 2nd Shock Army was encircled near Leningrad in July 1942. He will lead a National Russian Army of Liberation. See The Illusion: Soviet Soldiers in Hitlers' Armies (1978) by Juergen Thorwald, and Against Stalin and Hitler (1970) by Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt, and the Dutch documentary, Angels of Death, 1998.

This has the last footage of Hitler, as he awards Hitlerjugend, before the Battle of Berlin.

8330288,4,B001OBBS1Y,"This series spans (20) DVD discs!  If you are a WWII historian you will love these discs!  A lot of clips that I have never seen before and translated to English.  All represent what Gerbles was pitching to the German public during the war.  Very interesting but time consuming with 20 discs to watch.  I was missing this last #20 disc, now I have them all.",1363046400,,357,4.348484848484849
