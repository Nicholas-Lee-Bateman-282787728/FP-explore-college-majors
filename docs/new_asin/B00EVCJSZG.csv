8609840,4,B00EVCJSZG,"Great presentation on how to show rotations, how to handle ball screens, great trapping opportunities, and stagger screens.  The only reason I did not rate it as a 5 star because there are no breakdown drills to truly encompass these defense exotic looks for your high school basketball programs.  Regardless, it's a great investment to purchase.  If you switch screens on your man to man defense or a play a match-up zone, your breakdown drills would be a great fundamental to place this defense in a game situation.",1412035200,,517,4.8522727272727275
