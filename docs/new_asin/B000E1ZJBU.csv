8104425,5,B000E1ZJBU,"I'm a fan of Chris Freytag and what's so easy about these exercises is that they are divided into 10-minute chunks.  If you're in the mood for aerobics, you're covered.  If you'd rather do yoga stretching, you're covered.  Do 10 minutes, that's all --- or do another 10 minutes.

BTW, the first disc and the second disc have different exercises, BUT they're in the same categories.  So let's say I do the 10-minute yoga stretch on the 1st disc and decide I want a little more yoga?  I can go to the second disc, and there's another 10-minute chunk there.

This is my ""go to"" exercise DVD of the couple dozen or so exercise DVDs that I have.  it's the most versatile -- I can always find something for my mood.",1373155200,5,709,4.358778625954199
8104426,5,B000E1ZJBU,"I loved watching the cd! I became very educated on soo many topics that I had confusion and was like all of you, have been misleaded for so long. Chris defiantely knows her health educatioon and teaches it in a manner where I could watch, read (sub titles are optional)), and listen.. Her teaching styles are natural, not rehearsed, therefore, I was able to comprehend and digest everything into my brain, and learn it.

I will report back in about 3 weeks to inform you if the workouts are good.

Thanks~",1178755200,3,505,4.538461538461538
8104427,5,B000E1ZJBU,"I like to use one or two of the ten segments on these DVDs as ""add-ons"" after completing a Leslie Sansone walk.  The instructor is personable and presents a nice variety of exercises that are well cued and easy to follow.  There are two background exercisers with her and one always shows beginner modifications.  The little count-down clock at the bottom of the screen is a nice touch too.  I must confess I've never watched the third DVD included, which I believe is about eating habits.",1171670400,4,489,4.651162790697675
8104428,5,B000E1ZJBU,"This work out is the best response to any exercise program I've ever tried. I have lost over 20lbs in conjunction with the South Beach diet in just 6 weeks. I have gone from a bra size of 40DD to a 36G. I am very please with this product, it's going to be Christmas presents for close family and friends. Get this DVD you won't regret it.",1158537600,6,338,4.059701492537314
8104429,4,B000E1ZJBU,"This is a 3 disc programme.  The first two discs have 5 ten minute routines on them, each have Upper Body, Lower Body, Cardio, Pilates (abs) and Yoga (stretching).  Those two discs have the same order of routines but each routine is different (different abs to the first disc etc).  Within those routines, I find it's a little short to be of major benefit.  I think that if you do it on a regular basis though, you will feel better and possibly look better, but you should be looking for a minimum cardio workout of 30 minutes.

Chris is a friendly instructor.  She has a body to motivate you.  She over uses the word 'awesome', but she's motivating and outgoing and offers words of encouragement.

The third disc has tips on healthy eating and lifestyle and that's a great little bonus.  Each of the first two discs has a bonus 'conversation with Chris', but that is the same recording on both discs.

Overall, this workout is good (to add to your existing routine).  The thing I like most about it is that EVERYONE can find 10 minutes to do even one routine.  It's not that hard to do.  You will need a stability ball, weights and they use those elastic bands, but I do this with the weights, and they use a step for the cardio.  This is worth a go for sure, especially if you are a beginner or if you want to add a little extra to your existing routines or if you are very time crunched.",1148083200,19,1390,4.316602316602316
