8201626,2,B000RO6K26,"Not much more needs to be said about this other than the sound quality is so horrible it's frankly unwatchable.  If they ever do a remastering it might be worth a relook, but based on what they have given us, how can you tell?",1416182400,3,226,4.136363636363637
8201627,5,B000RO6K26,"I was very pleased with the dvd The Queen of Spades, It is a classic among Tchaikowsky compositions.
It is a classic as well this motion picture with the Bolshoi Opera.
I think this dvd will please everyone of good taste and sensibility.",1368057600,3,237,4.534883720930233
8201628,4,B000RO6K26,"As usual for Bolshoi productions, this is very well performed both visually and musically. Unfortunately, the technical aspects are not as good. The video has white flashes often seen in old unrestored films (although this one is not that old), and the audio is only Dolby stereo. Also, as with all Kultur releases, the plot information is minimal.",1202688000,22,348,5.017241379310345
8201629,5,B000RO6K26,"This all-star cast is made up of Pique Dame experts. The production buy Baratov in the Pokrovskiy version is the best Queen of Spades production. The stage-design is romantic and realistic. Atlantov is a great Gherman. He  sings and acts passionatly and his voice is one of the best since Del  Monaco. Milashkina is correctly called the best Lisa, even though she is  not as good as on the 1974 recording, conducted by Mark Ermler and with  Atlantov as Gherman. Yuriy Mazurok makes the relativly small part of  Yeletskiy (he has only one major aria) as importaint as the three leads. He  is my persanaly favored baritone and he once again showes his talant in  this video. Obraztsova is a great Countess. She proves herself to be not  only a great singer, but a wonderfull dramatic actress. Yuriy Grigoryev is  a fine Tomskiy and Liudmila Shemchuk a lovely Pouline. Simonov is keeping  the performance's pace up. The character roles are all taken very well.",948931200,16,957,4.780487804878049
