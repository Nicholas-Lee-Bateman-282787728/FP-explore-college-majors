But it always stood out in the forefront of my memory as being a great film. I had forgotten the name of the movie for TEN YEARS and have actually researched for the past few weeks until I re-discovered it, if that tells you anything about how well I liked it. I only gave it four stars because I have not yet viewed it, again. Kieran Mulroney gives a very moving and convincing performance as someone who wavers between being resolute and questioning his own faith. Chris Rock, well he rocks! It's got action, emotional drama, comedic relief, it's a concrete blonde!",1127865600,2,745,4.290780141843972
1085462,4,6305858217,"Eight misfit criminals unite to simultaneous steal from various targets in the city. Of course it all goes bad, predictable but still fun and entertaining.  There's a lot of gunfire, explosions, tough-guys and a gal, and some humor thrown in.  It translates to a very good action-thriller. Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts, is as good as he was in Runway Train (he was nominated for an Academy Award for in 1985). At the end of this film you might be surprise who the real target is!  It's worth your time, however it is only available in limited quantities, you'll have to order it and wait.  But it's worth it.  By the way, Chris Rock is true to form and he'll make you laugh!  Rate R for strong language and violence.",1023840000,5,722,4.515384615384615
1085463,4,6305858217,"A crafty nightclub owner (Jack) brings together a group of small time hoods and teams them up in unusual pairs (black man and white racist, Ivy Leaguer and simpleton) for a set of multiple heists which turn out to be an  elaborate double cross against a notorious gangster (Domenic). The second  half of the film is an extended standoff in the nightclub between Jack and  his band of thieves and Domenic's henchman, during which the thieves  discover why Jack brought them all together for what amounts to a suicidal  mission.
I hate to give more than general info as I do not like to ruin  the surprises for others. What I will tell you is that I found this film  very interesting and liked the pairing of the two worst to work together  and why. I also liked the reasons that the people were brought in on the  deal. Over all this movie had some very well written twists and turns that  make this movie more than just a B-movie.
The cast was also well put  together, including, Eric Roberts, Tia Carrere, and Chris Rock.",963360000,13,1022,4.47027027027027

1085553,2,6305858217,"This was obviously a movie that was rushed out to ride the wave of success that other movies caught in the wake of Reservoir Dogs, and other Tarantino flicks from the time. The difference is that while Tarantino is a fantastic Writer/Director, this film had neither. It seems obvious that both were just trying to make a Tarantino film, and neither had the talent to pull off a decent copy. Not worth it. Stay away.",1304208000,,415,4.546666666666667
1085554,1,6305858217,"Very wrongly titled.  Change the name of the movie, and then it is a fair B movie.  Has nothing to do with Immortals.",1281916800,,117,4.043478260869565
1085555,5,6305858217,"The Immortals is a true masterpiece of suspense and drama. With a powerful cast do eight strangers plus Jack come to life, and through their struggle to survive their fate do they hold our heart in their hands. And the storyline is a sweet symphony that wastes no time sweeping us off our feet and stealing our breath away, and as the story spirals to its climax does it hold us spellbound, captivated by the bonds that form and the fight for life over death. And in the end does humanity give light to this intense movie, and do we remember a powerful roller-coaster ride that pulls us down into characters to be unforgotten.",1277337600,2,626,4.5
1085556,3,6305858217,"When I first saw this movie, it had already debuted on HBO or Cinemax back in 1995/1996.  Once I managed to see the TV version, I thought it was a very well-done movie with a good cast and an original story.  I bought it on DVD a couple of weeks ago and I noticed it was a different cut of the film than the one I remembered so fondly.  In the DVD version, the movie is going in chronological order (from the night club, to meeting their partners, to the heists, etc.).  In the TV version, all the scenes at the night club before meeting their partners are flashbacks while the scenes in which the characters meet their respective partners is the present time, so it cuts back and forth (hence in the TV version, the director's credit would've immediately followed the other opening credits instead of showing up a couple of scenes later).  I preferred the latter because in my opinion, it added more mystique to the circumstances as to why all the characters were there and it flowed a lot smoother, hence it didn't feel poorly edited.  Also, some of the scenes in the DVD version are cut shorter and to me, it makes those sequences feel that they don't flow very well and they cut so abruptly, I felt uncomfortable watching those scenes because of the shoddy editing (i.e. music score abruptly stops, characters are cut off mid-sentence, etc.).  Also, I believe the time that was cut out of the original version could've developed the characters a little bit more.  For example, in the scene where the character of Benny is dying, he tells Pete and Kerry to give his share to his wife and kid.  Seeing the DVD version, you would assume he's talking about the stolen loot.  But in the TV version, he's actually referring to a lottery ticket that he takes out of his pocket and hands it to Pete before he dies (you actually see Benny lose consciousness).  Once he's dead, Pete puts the ticket back into Benny's coat pocket.  I think that the few minutes missing in the DVD version would have added more depth to the characters and you would probably feel a little bit more for them.  I do not know why the director decided to re-edit the film this way.  So, I rated it three stars because even though I really enjoyed watching it after all these years and I still think it's a good movie, to me the TV version is the superior cut.  Maybe one day I may be able to find a copy of this original version on DVD.",1250467200,6,2407,4.401805869074492
1085557,3,6305858217,"This bit of wisdom is imparted by nightclub owner Nick (Eric Roberts) to the eight thieves he's assembled to pull off a dangerous heist. If you make it to the end of this movie, you'll agree with him and want yours back. A great cast that includes Tia Carrere, Joe Pantoliano, Tony Curtis, William Forsythe, Clarence Williams and an annoying Chris Rock do the best they can to make it work but it's not enough. Nick plans on relieving an ""overseas investor"" of four suitcases containing $7 million. He pairs the crooks up in teams of two and since none of them like each other the robbery doesn't go off without a hitch. Two of the team are shot and one is gravely wounded. It's a lot like 'Reservoir Dogs' since one of the bad guys is shot in the stomach and spends the remainder of the film bleeding to death and the bleeding baddies return to the nightclub awaiting further instructions from their leader. The movie was written by Kevin Barnhardt who plays Billy in the film. He's a better actor than writer and not surprisingly he gives himself some of the best lines. Tony Curtis is the most fun as a Mafioso who suspects Nick is up to something and who storms the nightclub with a couple of his boys to straighten the young punk out. The Mexican standoff is hilarious thanks to Curtis and Roberts. The surprise twist explaining why the robbers were chosen was unexpected and works in the film's favor. If you're a fan of any of the actors you might get a chuckle out of this one but if you can take em or leave em than leave this film alone. For the two people who saw the Steven Seagal bomb squad masterpiece 'Ticker' you'll recognize a LOT of footage that's been stolen from that film and inserted in this one.",1246838400,2,1718,4.422712933753943

1085561,2,6305858217,"I was comfounded by this movie. is it a comedy, actioner,feelgooder.? whatever  it was trying to achieve it missed the mark. The movie is about a bunch of criminals who convene by the order of a mastermind (Eric Roberts) to pull robberies across the city to test their mettle and competence for ripping off the head of a mafia crime family(Tony Curtis). The problem I had with this is that all the characters appear so stupid you wonder how they could be career criminals in the first place. Their zany stupidity takes away from the film for it to be a decent actioner. and as far as the comic aspect, it works to hard to be funny to be actually funny!! it provokes no reactions within you,this movie is stale,it doesn't keep your attention. As far as the performances are concerned they are uninspired you get the feeling that this was just a job for these actors. I bought this movie to see Tia Carrere,but in this movie she's neither striking nor convincing,all these actors appear to be walking through their parts. I recommend you save your money on this film.",1197849600,,1065,4.575916230366492
