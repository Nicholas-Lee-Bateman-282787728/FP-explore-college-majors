1371001,5,B00004Y56Y,"A long time ago, an ancient wizard named Clow created a large of mystical cards, each with it's own unique power.  The cards could occasionally escape from their card forms and take on forms of their own.  For example, the Power card has incredible strength, and it can lend that strength to other creatures if it wants to.  However, when the Power card is not in a card form, it looks like a harmless, sweet, pink little midget girl.  Eventually, Clow decided that the Clow cards were too wild to control, so he trapped them in their card forms, then locked them in a mystical book which he called the Clow Book.  Clow then summoned Kerosberos, a mystical beast who is the lord of the sun, to watch over the Clow Cards and make sure no one lets them out of the book.  And just to make sure the Clow Cards stayed in the book,(Clow DID NOT want these cards to escape!)Clow put a magical seal on the book, and only someone with magical power could open it.  Unfortunately, all of Clow's hard work was wasted when a young descendant of his named Sakura innocently decided to open the Clow Book to see what was inside.  Kerosberos was sleeping at the time, but when he woke up, boy was he ever ticked off!  Now Sakura has to capture all the cards and put them back in the book.  Sakura occasionally gets help from her ever-serious classmate and fellow cardcaptor, Li(prounounced Lee)and sometimes Li captures a card before Sakura can get to it.  Cardcaptors is A LOT like Pokemon, only with cards.  However, it's unique in it's own way, too.  The only thing I don't like about Cardcaptors is that Nelvana decided to rearrange the order in which the episodes were aired.  For example, in the ""first"" episode, Sakura already has at least eight cards with her!  How can that be if the series just started?!  That's all I have to say!",971654400,,1826,4.471299093655589
1371002,4,B00004Y56Y,"This DVD contains the US 'remix' of the original Japanese 'Card Captor Sakura' series, now called ""Cardcaptors"".
The basic story is  that in ancient times, the elemental forces of magic were sealed in some  cards and locked them away in a book (the clow book), which can only be  opened by someone with the appropriate power. Guess what, Sakura, the star  of our show, has the power, but when she opens the book the cards fly away.  With the help of the winged beast Cerberus (Kero), her good friend Madison  (formerly Tomoyo) and schoolboy rival Li,  Sakura's ""gotta catch 'em  all"" and return the cards to their rightful form.
Because  CardCaptors is aimed at children, some character names have been changed  from the original Japanese, and the focus of the show is more on Li and  Sakura as a card-capturing team rather than Sakura on her own. Some  elements of the original Japanese series aren't present here, either  because they might offend an easily-offended audience, or because they were  thought to be too ""girlie"" to keep the attention of boys.
CardCaptors starts from around the eighth episode of the original CCS  series, where Li is introduced, and focuses more on the action-based  episodes, leaving out many of those pesky ""girlie"" episodes  entirely.
If you've seen CCS before, treat CardCaptors as a remix of the  show you already know. Spot the differences. Enjoy them. If you've only  ever seen CardCaptors, check out the original 'Card Captor Sakura' as well  - you'll find it a treasure trove of extra untold stories and deeper plot  lines.
However you get into either series, whichever one you've seen  first, you won't be disappointed.",966643200,7,1662,4.902877697841727
1371003,1,B00004Y56Y,"Cardcaptors is the worst dub of an anime that was ever made.  It's even more terrible of a dub than Sailor Moon's.  The Japanese version was originally called Cardcaptor Sakura, a magical girl anime based on the popular manga written by the all-female manga artist team, Clamp.  The series was originally targeted at young girls, but Nelvana believed that the series would get higher ratings if they aimed it at boys more.  So, Nelvana attempted to cut out all the relationships and character development of the show in order to mutate the series into another action-oriented Pokemon clone.  The end result is an emotionless mismash of action scenes that don't really flow well together at all.  For this review, I will focus on comparing Cardcaptors to Cardcaptor Sakura.  I won't be listing all of the cuts Nelvana made because there's way too many to list here, but I will list the major cuts to give you an idea of what the original Japanese version is like.  Hopefully, this will encourage you to seek out the Japanese version if you haven't already and experience the series the way it was meant to be seen.

The first major change is in the name of the series.  Nelvana changed the title from Cardcaptor Sakura to Cardcaptors, and while this doesn't seem to be like a big deal at first glance, it actually is important because the name Cardcaptor Sakura implies that the series is about Sakura, which of course it is.  Sakura has always been the star of the show and always be.  However, by changing the name to Cardcaptors, they're trying to imply that Sakura is no longer the star, but that the series is more focused on Sharoan, making this name change the first victim of Nelvana's sexist attitude that the show will suck if it doesn't appeal to boys.  The next big change is in the music.  The Japanese version featured a beautiful orchestrated musical score that really reflected the mood of the series, being mostly light-hearted and happy, but at the same time being able to be quite serious in tone as well, much like the episodes themselves.  Nelvana replaced all of this with some generic cartoony style music that all sounds exactly alike.  All the songs were changed too and they all sound exteremly cartoony and cheesy and are all played on a synthesizer, rather than with real instruments and real professional singers, unlike the Japanese version.

Almost all of the names were changed to English names because Nelvana believed that American kids are too stupid to remember the Japanese names.  The few characters who did retain their Japanese names had them mispronounced horribly.  For example, in the Japanese version, our heroine is called Sakura Kinomoto (and Sakura is supposed to be pronounced ""Sah-ku-rah""), but the dub changes her name to Sakura Avalon and mispronounces Sakura as ""Seh-koorah"".  Clow was originally supposed to rhyme with glow or go, but Nelvana changed it so that it rhymed with cow or now instead.  And Kero's name is supposed ot be pronounced ""Keh-ro"" but ends up being mispronounced as ""Kee-roh.""  Originally, Nelvana had actually intended to dub all the episodes, but Kid's WB insisted that Nelvana skip the first seven episodes and start the series at episode eight, with the introduction of Shaoran Li/Li Showron.  The first seven episodes may not have had as much action as episode eight, but they were important because they helped set up the storyline and introduced us to the main characters.  The dub just decides to throw us right smack in the middle of the action with no explanations at all as to what's going on.

Many other episodes were also skipped and combined because Kid's WB didn't think they were action-packed enough.  The Japanese version had a total of 70 episodes but only about 39 of them were ever actually aired in the U.S.  After Cardcaptors completed its initial U.S. broadcast, Nelvana then went back and dubbed all the episodes they skipped, re-inserting them into their proper order and broadcasted them in all other English-speaking countries outside the U.S., such as Canada and the UK.  Interestingly enough, the episodes which weren't aired in the U.S. actually had signifincantly less cuts than the episodes that were, although they were still far from being perfect.  And the episodes that were also aired in the U.S. were identical to their American broadcasts, save for the combined episodes, which were uncombined when aired in other English countries.  Many changes were made to the plot and characters' personalities.  All of the romance was edited out in order to focus more on the action scenes, the Final Judgement episodes and the ending were completly screwed up, and many other important plot details were severaly altered in Cardcaptors.

Almost every character in the series was made to be ten times more snobbier in the dub than they were in the original, but the characters who suffered the most from personality changes were Tomoyo Daidouji/Madison Taylor and Shaoran/Li.  Tomoyo was originally a very sweet girl who cared deeply for her friend and did everything she could to help her capture the Clow Cards, even though she had no magical powers of her own.  She also filmed all of Sakura's adventures on video tape and designed all of her battle costumes for her, because ""special times require special clothing.""  Madison, on the other hand, is a very snobby technology-obessesed valleygirl, obessesed with recording cool action scenes to upload on her website, orders all of Sakura's costumes from the ""latest fashion magazines"", and cares more about recording some cool footage than the actual safety of her friend.  Shaoran originally only bullied Sakura for the first couple of episodes until the two were forced to work together to capture the cards.  Shaoran eventually started to treat her more kindly after realizing that the girl had potential; by the end of the second season, he started to become closer friends with her, and he even fell in love with her towards the end of the series.

However, in Cardcaptors, Li taunts Sakura for being pathetic almost the entire time.  He doesn't start to become closer friends with her until the third season, and their entire relationship is completely cut out in the dub.  Almost every episode has at least three minutes of footage cut out, basically including anything Nelvana thought was too cute, funny, romantic, anything remotely Japanese culture-related, or anything they believed to be inapproiate for children's American television.  Many of the characters in the Japanese version were actually engaged in controversial relationships, including homosexuality, incest, and even pedophilia.  The relationships are only talked about and never portrayed in a sexual manner; they don't even hold hands or kiss, but the relationships were there and Nelvana wanted to cut them all out, even the ""innocent"" ones in order to transform the show into another brainless Pokemon rip-off.

Topped with generally bad actors and crappy dialog, Cardcaptors is easily the worst dub of all time.  The only thing Nelvana did right was allow Geneon to release an official subbed version.  The dub is just so sloppily handled that it makes it more confusing than it actually should be because they cut out all the important details.  And obiviously Nelvana's belief that the show would do better if it was aimed at boys more was false because the Cardcaptors DVDs have been discontinued while the Cardcaptor Sakura DVDs are still selling strong and Cardcaptors is no longer being broadcasted on American TV.  If you've never seen Cardcaptor Sakura before, I strongly urge you to watch the Japanese version, especially if you've only seen the dub.  The Japanese version is so much more cuter, funnier, more intelligent, and just down right good than Cardcaptors.  Yes, it's presented in Japanese which means yes, you do have to read the English subtitles, but it's not at all hard to do.  The subtitles are positioned on a good enough place on the screen where you can read them and still see all the action that's going on screen.  Cardcaptor Sakura is so enjoyable that you'll find yourself so wrapped in its story and characters that you'll completly forget that what you're watching is in Japanese.  So, forget about Cardcraptors.  Go check out Cardcaptor Sakura to see the real deal because you'll surely won't regret it.",1128211200,13,8374,4.96987087517934
1371004,4,B00004Y56Y,"As you well know If you've ever watched Cardcaptors while it was on KIDS-WB then there's a sure chance that you loved it and thought it was coolest thing on WB at that time. However if not, you'll be sure to be complaining like some rich-man's spoiled brat like the purist you are because of the that its an edited version of CLAMPS queer Cardcaptor Sakura and you'll be bashing it like the day is long. Sure they show episodes out of order, they edited it, they took out scenes inappropriate (as well as non-inappropriate for airing time) for children even see. But for some reason Cardcaptors will forever be the better side of what Cardcaptor Sakura has to offer. Basically it has Sakura Avalon, Madison Taylor, Li Syaoran, Melin Rae, and other children of the series portrayed as best friends: Li and Sakura as rivals at first. Sakura's brother Tori isn't a homosexual nor is his friend and her crush Juilian Star, they're friends. And Li is simply afraid of him and does not a attraction towards him like Sakura.

In Cardcaptor Sakura Tomoyo Daidouji acts with Lesbian tendencies and secretly is in love with Sakura Kinomoto however will not reveal this to her ""friend."" Kinomoto Touya is a homosexual who has his eyes on Tsukishiro Yukito who seems to return the affection, Syaoran Li also as crush on Yukito. Sasaki Rika [Rita] is in love her Teacher Terada Yoshiyuki [Mr. Terata] who doesn't to anything to deter this girl's feelings, he just gasps and clears his throat pretending to never notice. Mihara Chiharu (Chelsea) and Yamazaki Takashi (Zachary) are cousin's (whether distant or close is never explained) who are romantically involved with each other. Hiiragizawa Eriol (Eli) and Lalyla Mackenzie (Mizuki Kaho) are supposedly romantically involved as well despite the reincarnated version of Clow Reed's young age. Those are only major differences between the two versions aside from the other stuff: That they changed the relationships between the characters and their names among other things in the US versions (thankfully). But If your the kind of person who isn't bothered by this type of content in cartoons that look as though are meant to be for a younger set of children spanning from the youngest to the 10/11 year olds, then let them watch it. It doesn't mean what the characters portray is right.

However, the story in either versions remain the same. Sakura Avalon discovers a clow book in the basement of her house and accidentally releases 52 or more spirits trapped in the form of cards and is chosen by the would-be guardian Kero to return them to their original state thus becoming their master after undergoing a test performed by the second guardian Yue who is actually Sakura's friend Julian. Li Syaoran believes that she doesn't deserve to be master of the clow cards and scorns her and her ""Stuffed animal"" Kero constantly but becomes her friend later on in the series (a romantic interest in the Japanese Version). But naturally like the stereotypical character she is, Sakura tries her best to be friends with Li while proving to him that she can be a cardcaptor.

The voice acting supplied by Nelvana who use young boys and girls for the characters, Li and Sakura is far better than the Japanese sub for CCS who's actors for the children sound as though they've inahled helium, which beccomes most annoying overtime. The music is a hell of a more bearable in the US version than it is in the Japanese version, however when it comes songs with Lyrics in them the Japanese version CCS does a better job. There's a lot more action Cardcaptors than CCS and much like FOX-KIDS' version of Esacflowne it focuses more on the main male character Li Syaoran to my great delight but doesn't shut out the main focus of the show, Sakura. So if you've ever watched Cardcaptors you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did when it was KIDSWB. If your not a purist that is. [a---- 4 out of 5]",1111276800,3,3918,4.741935483870968
1371005,4,B00004Y56Y,"This is about Sakura Avalon, a girl who released a book of clow cards and now has to capture them all. This shows episodes of her capturing the Thunder, Time, and Erase card. The new exchange student named Li Showron showed up and sensed that Sakura had the cards.
In the beginning they don't get along that much but in the second season they start to get along and Li has a crush on Sakura.
Look, I see that almost everyone likes CARDCAPTOR SAKURA and it was originally made that way, but everyone be quiet about Cardcaptors is stupid and stuff. You guys all think that there isn't cut scenes and has a cool dialouge, but its in JAPANESE. And you have to keep reading the subtitle on the bottom and not watch the action. Anyways, Cardcaptors should be the same as Cardcaptor Sakura.",1080691200,3,783,4.444444444444445
1371006,5,B00004Y56Y,"I have seen the Jap version and I like them but I have to say that I love the US version more, Sakura is a strong kid and so is Li they make a great team. When you watch all the volumes they explain about the cards and also if you watched every episode on TV then you would learn more about Clow him self. I wish the rest of the shows that were aired were also on tape. I think the story is very interesting and a little mysterious. It is cute and has sweetness like Pokemon but magic weirdness like Yu-Gi-Oh, (big fan of Pokmon and Yugioh).  I think people have to see the US version first and then watch the Japs to decide. Personally I don't mind the more adult themes in the Jap version but I really like Sakura and Li together and don't like to think of the kid as a homosexual. And I don't think cursing makes any show (cartoons or live) any better. It is all a matter of opinion. Hopefully I will one day have a complete set of the show.

1371007,1,B00004Y56Y,Ok i hate the english version of cardcaptors. Its badly dubbed all the parts are taken out. Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura are to complety different things. You want to see good dubbing then get some Sakura Wars DVDs there excellent. Ive seen all the cardcaptor eps on tv. Im also waitng for my cardcaptor Sakura complete 1-70dvd boxset that i got off ebay. plus the 2movies. Cardcaptors is not the same as the orginal version.,1073001600,2,430,4.746666666666667
1371008,1,B00004Y56Y,"I practically cried when I first saw this. What did they do to my darling Cardcaptor Sakura, the manga series I treasure? What did we do to deserve this horrific mangling of it? What were Nelvana trying to accomplish?
First things first: CARDCAPTOR SAKURA AND CARDCAPTORS ARE NOT THE SAME THING. Not at all.
If you, like me, loved Cardcaptor Sakura, then buy the Japanese videos or DVDs off here because they have English subtitles, and they have all the relationships intact and a good, mature plot.  Cardcaptors is a hopeless, shambling affair obviously made with the six year old market in mind, which is not what the original Cardcaptor Sakura manga was aimed at. Read the back of the books, they say ""Young Adult"".
The main reasons why I hate this pitiful affair is because 1) they changed their names but mostly 2) they ruined every relationship between characters because Nelvana deemed them ""not suitable"" for the Western market. CLAMP must be grinding their teeth about how distorted their characters are becoming. Examples 1) Touya (or Toya) Kinomoto becomes Tori Avalon (isn't Tori a girl's name?), Yukito Tsukishiro becomes Julian Star, Tomoyo Daidouji becomes Madison Taylor. 2) They cut out Li Syaoran's crush on Yukito, Tomoyo's crush on Sakura, Touya and Yukito being in love, Rika and Mr Terada being in love and Meilin's feelings about Syaoran.
You can see how changing all these relationships - as well as more - changes the whole feel of the series. It is not even close to the original. It is like a watered-down copy of the original. Do not buy this unless you are blind, deaf, or under five.",1068854400,6,1614,4.805755395683454
1371009,1,B00004Y56Y,"Cardcaptor Sakura is a wonderful series and I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone.  However, people should not be tricked into thinking that Cardcaptors is the same thing as Cardcaptor Sakura.  They most certainly are not.  If you are thinking about purchasing this dvd, do yourself a favor and instead buy Cardcaptor Sakura Vol. 1- The Clow.  Not only will you get the original storyline from the japanese series and spare yourself the complete hack job Nelvana did attempting to put it on the American market; you will get more episodes and a storyline that makes more sense.  I think if you read more of the reviews you will find that those who have seen both Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura agree that Cardcaptors is no more than a grotesque cut and paste editing project on a fantasic series.",1059264000,3,803,4.8321167883211675
1371010,2,B00004Y56Y,"Cardcaptors was butchered very badlyfrom the original Japanese version. This new series by Nelvana (grr.. I hate you!) is missing many episodes and the story is somewhat different. They wanted to turn this heart-warming girls' series into a action-packed boys' series (which it is not!). In the series (refering to TV) scenes with Sakura's grandfather was taken out because it would have seemed inappropriate for an action series. They also changed relationships and feelings, such as Syaoran's (Li) love for Yukito (Julian), Chiharu (Chelsea) and Takashi's (Zachary) relationship, Meiling's (Meilin) feelings and relationship with Syaoran (Li), and so much more.
If you are into the series, I recommend Cardcaptor Sakura, the un-dubbed and untampered series. It is so much more satifying.",1057363200,,789,5.528925619834711

Sakura's Rival: At school there is a transfered student from Hong Kong named Li Showron. He is a part of the Reed family! Li and Sakura trys to capture the Thunder card later on. As Sakura used the Shadow card and Li used some of his powers, the Thunder card is captured. Li and Sakura made a good team but Sakura said ""This is only the beginning.""

Time And Again: Sakura had a music test at school. Sakura didn't really practice that much so she messed up on her recorder. Her brother told her to practice some more to get it right. Sakura did that and her brother was right, she did it! Sakura told Kero that she was going to show them NEXT time. And well, tomorrow was going to be the next time. Sakura was at school and wondering what is going on here? Only Li and Sakura could notice that they were back in time only 1 day later. Then they knew it is the Time card.

The Cave: Sakura is on a field trip to the beach while Kero is at home whining and mumbling. (Kero wanted to go with Sakura at the beach.) Sakura looked at the cave while she was in the water. She thought there was ghosts in there. It was night time. Sakura was at the Girls bedroom. Nikki told 1 of Zachary's storys about the cave. While Nikki was telling the story, the teacher comes in and checks on them and told them they had to go to sleep. The next day they went to the cave while it was dark. They holded candle sticks to see. When everyone was in there they were starting to dissapeir. Sakura captured the card when Li was around and the card was captured. It was called the Erase.

1371015,2,B00004Y56Y,"I know what you're already thinking by my bringing up the French version of Card Captor Sakura, but honestly, it plays a very important role, so sit and wait.
Nelvana and Kids WB decided to ""join forces"" when creating an English Adaptation of this show, and instead of dubbing each episode in a proper order, the kids that they interviewed (mostly males) decided they wanted Syaoran Li into the show right away!  This doesn't work, as Li doesn't even enter until the 8th episode.
So, not only are the first seven episodes thrown aside (dubbed later on, some of them), the episodes are now completely out of order, making the existing plot now almost impossible to follow.  Also, the music has been replaced, the new theme song is completely 'blorg', and the voices don't fit the characters at all.  I love the Ocean Group and all, but...valley girl doesn't fit Sakura's description.
All right, I did mention the French dub in here.  Quite frankly, it's excellent.  The original theme song is there with replaced lyrics, there's original music, next to no cuts; the voices are fantastic!  Sakura actually sounds like a sweet, cute child.  What does this have to do with anything?
Nelvana dubbed it.
Two versions:  English and French.  Who gets stuck with the butchered one?  The English speaking folk, while our anime French speaking friends in Quebec are being delighted by how well the show was handled.
What I don't understand is why the English version wasn't treated so well.  It sickens me, along with any other anime fans.",1027900800,3,1528,4.816091954022989

The only ""real"" extra is the Japanese opening, which is prittey cool and has some great music.  Now, to continue the good, the first episode is ""Sakura's Rival"" where Sakura first meets Li Showron and captures the Thunder card.  The second episode is Time and Again, which I had never seen before until I bought this DVD(another tie to me is two days later I purchased the doll of Sakura where she is wearing the costume she wears in this episode, the green fairy costume) Sakura has to repeat a day where she has to redo a music test in which she scored poorly on the first day, and Kero loses the video game save in which he is on the last level when the day repeats.  Sakura turns the time spirit back into a card but, the card chooses to go with Li.  The last episode is The Cave (one of my favorites).  In which, Sakura goes on a field trip to the beach.

I'm 15, and I was tired of the basic old cartoons for kids.  I had fallen in love with Cardcaptors on Kids WB, but I had to admit that the way it was directed at really young kids sort of turned me off.

Following on the heels of the success of Sailor Moon, it would only make sense that Cardcaptor Sakura would find its way into American living rooms. However, the results were hugely disappointing to many fans of the series.
While many die-hard anime fans complain about the voices being so different, let's face it. There's no way to get Iwao Junko to come here and speak English for the dubbing company. The voice actors had to be different anyway. However, on the other hand, the actors for America's Card Captors really DO sound like the company just pulled some people off the street. In dubbing this series, cute became valley-girl attitude and sweetness became tiring melodrama. Characterizations changed completely, and if that's not bad enough, so did the story.
Card Captors bears little resemblance to its Japanese forbearer. By cutting the first six episodes, major plot points were deleted, resulting in a show where cartoon characters run around catching cards with no motivation or background story. I believe the argument for that was that it would have been too complicated for the target audience of pre-schoolers and very young children. What I can't understand is why the target audience had to be altered at all. The original audience consisted roughly of girls between the ages of eight and fourteen. The following the series amassed stretched far beyond that, with the result that CLAMP's entire fan base tuned in.
So let's send a message to the TV dubbing companies -- stop dumbing down our shows for American release! If it's entirely obvious that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura and that Touya and Yukito are more than best friends, then leave that in! Card Captors is an insult to both the audience and the creators.",1005523200,8,1958,4.972560975609756
1371022,1,B00004Y56Y,"(...)i have watched both the full series -or what is avaliable of cardcaptors- of card captors and card captor sakura
when nelvanna got the rights to the japanese card captor sakura and turned it into card captors they killed off something that was beautiful and made it kitch!!
all i can say is that if you consider yourself to be a cardcaptors fan, is that you should do your homework and have a look at the origianal japanese non-dubbed version. (dubbing is a crime!! always always choose a subbed version)
the japanese version is much more intrecate than the gruff and borish cardcaptors. in fact, i would even go as close to say that card captors is a huge insult!! not only to the card captor sakura series, and it's die hard fans, but also to it's audience.  i say that it is an insult to it's audience as it has dumbed the show down sooooo much, it is as if nelvanna doesn't htink that they can cope with the complexities that the origianal japanese story line has.
and yes, the nelvanna story line has been severely altered from what it once was.
please, don't think that i am being overly pushy or anything, i just beleive that everybody desires value for money, and if this is the case, then you should invest in true cardcaptor sakura merchandise, not its cheep little sibling version.
and if not, at least consider watching cardcaptor sakura and comparing it with cardcaptors - i promise you that you will not be disapointed with the origianl, and dare i say it, the best.

1371023,1,B00004Y56Y,"Cardcaptors.  Hacked up version of Cardcaptor Sakura.
Where to start.....?
The fact that Cardcaptors starts at episode 8 does not put this dub on good footing to start with.
Then the voice actors.
Sakura is meant to sound like a cheerful 10 year old girl.
SaKOOra sounds like an obnoxious 16 year old who has better things to do than appear in this series.
Syaoran (Li to all Cardcaptor watchers) just seems to sound like a bully through the entire trio of episodes.
And I will not even mention Madison (evil twin of Tomoyo), but can you say ""Valley girl""?
Then the cuts.....
All relationships are removed including Sakura-Tomoyo(Madison) and Touya(Tori)-Yukito(Julian) and Syaoran's apparent attraction to Yukito (Julian).
So Japan does not exist then.  Sakura now lives in Reedington which some clever person at Nelvana thought would be a clever play on Clow Reed's name (Clow is pronounced to rhyme with Glow, not Cow btw.)  And any hint that there may have been of Japanese character has been erased e.g. When Mr. Terada writes Syaoran's (Li's) name on the blackboard and nothing appears. Smooth editing eh?
The total cuts are too numerous to count but they even cut out the point where Yukito (Julian) throws Sakura some candy.
Now what is wrong with that?  Don't take candy from strangers?
Hmmmm......
Then there's the music.  Or what passes for music in CC.
The original songs fit the mood perfectly.  Nelvana seem to have pulled out a music catalogue and selected tracks at random.
The opening song it just scary.  The lyrics are bad but the person singing them is even worse!
Give me ""Catch You, Catch Me"" any day.
Now I will explain why you should buy the uncensored version:
1. You can see Cardcaptor Sakura for what it was originally meant to be, a shoujo (girls) anime.  But despite what Nelvana believes, this doesn't mean that only girls can enjoy it . It still appeals to a wide audience, perhaps even wider than CC which has been changed so much as to make Syaoran (Li) seem to play a much bigger part than he does and to convert it into a boys orientated action show.  It also shows the hero doesn't neccessarily have to be male.
2. It teaches lessions about *love* (something which Nelvana doesn't want you to believe exists) and friendship and relationships.
3. It is about SOOOO much more than capturing cards. (Which is all Cardcaptors is about)
So if you're too young to buy the uncut version, get your older brother/sister or parents to buy it for you.
If you have a younger brother/sister then let them watch the uncut version and if questioned explain that you are ""Helping them with their reading"".
I'm sure that once they can keep up, they will be much happier than if they had watched Cardcaptors.
If you think that the uncut version is more expensive then we must look at the facts
1. The Uncut version has 4 episodes on a DVD compared to 3 on the Cardcaptors DVD.
2. Each Cardcaptor Sakura episode is 25 minutes in length compared to the average length of 20 minutes for a Cardcaptors episode.
So do the right thing, and leave this DVD well alone.",1003881600,5,3078,4.65377532228361

So why only 1 star? Because anyone who actually spends money buying this DVD must have a few screws loose. Tape it off TV, and buy the uncut subtitled Cardcaptor Sakura discs instead.

Blasphemy, I'm sure many are thinking, how is that possible?  Well I will tell you.  Now I know that Nelvana changed quite a bit from the original, like episode three (Japan) where they changed Sakura's date with Yukito/Julian to a chance encounter where he offered to buy her some ice cream, as well as Kero telling her she didn't have adequate cards to telling her that she could only use three certain cards.  Yes they changed it, but are these changes really that bad?  Now I'm not trying to insult either version of the series, because like I said I enjoy both, but since the dubbed seems to be so vehemently loathed I figured that I would focus my attention on that.  First of all many people don't like how Nelvana removed many of the eastern influences in the series.  I don't believe that they did this because children over here can't understand it or what not, I think they did it so that they could relate to it more.  As for the character changes, I don't think that they butchered them as much as people say.  I mean they did make Li a bit more attitude towards Sakura, but it wasn't like he was completely nice to her to begin with.  As for Sakura, some people claim that they made her more of a whiner, quite frankly I think that she whines in both.  So all I'm saying is that while they did change it slightly, they did not give the series a complete 180 like some people like to make it sound.  Yes there are differences, but that doesn't mean that they are all bad, in fact I think that the dubbed even improved a few aspects.  I don't know why, but the majority of subbed fans of Cardcaptor Sakura, seem to think that any change is bad.

1371039,1,B00004Y56Y,"I have to assume that anyone interested in this DVD is primarily familiar with this series through the dubbed version shown on Kid's WB and Teletoon, entitled ""Cardcaptors"". What you may not realize is that this DVD does NOT contain the same episodes as the concurrently released subtitled version of this show, entitled ""Cardcaptor Sakura"".
 The first two DVDs of ""Cardcaptors"" contain episodes 8, 12, 17; and 13, 9, and 20, respectively.  The first two DVDs of ""Cardcaptor Sakura"", on the other hand, contain episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7, and 8.  So if you really love ""Cardcaptors"", you should also buy the first two volumes of the subtitled version, since they contain *different episodes* from the dub release.  In addition, episodes 1-7 that appear on the first two subtitled DVDs have NEVER been and never will be shown on N. American TV. Nor will they ever be released on the dubbed versions of the DVDs, as they were never dubbed.

Fallacy #1: ""There is no subtitled version available.""  This is NOT TRUE. Search on the words ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" and the subtitled version will show up.
Fallacy #2: ""The dub is cheaper than the subtitled version."" Again, NOT TRUE! The dubbed DVD is $21.49, while the subtitled version is $25.49. HOWEVER, the dubbed version only contains 3 episodes, while the subtitled version contains 4! If you do the math, you will find that *the subtitled version is actually CHEAPER on a per episode basis!*
 If you are contemplating buying the dubbed version, you owe it to yourself to watch the subtitled version first. You'll get to see the original episodes, in order, as they were meant to be seen. And if you still prefer the dub after seeing the first 8 episodes in Japanese, you can get the dub without worrying about duplicating any episodes (except #8), since the first two DVDs of Cardcaptor Sakura contain episodes that have not been and will not be released dubbed.",979257600,15,1989,4.747826086956522

The begining is confusing since they start off with the 8th episode.  Throughout the show they have to show ""flashbacks"" because the episode skip according to what they think is a good order.  Also, how many times on TV have you seen these episodes?  Maybe about 5 now, or more.  They show repeats of the same episodes over and over again!  The dialect has been totally ""modernized"" to sound ""hip"" and ""cool.""  Okay . . .  and Nelvana makes totally stupid cuts too! *What's wrong with Japan???

I never seen the japanese version because THANKS to God, I do have better things to do than being watching cartoons all day long and then come over here to complaint about how bad are the translations. The English version is good, and if the japanese version is better, I sincerely do not care. I have too little time like to be trying to get some japanese version that who knows who is selling, at what price??!! and to be reading every single line that comes out in the cartoon. If you have the time for that and the MONEY, go for it, but if you don't, I really do NOT belive it's important to know who likes who in the Cartoon. The important thing is how Sakura captures the cards, Not if Sakura loves I don't who, or if whoever whats Sakura's brothers, etc. So, in less words, Cardcaptors, the English version is really, really, good!

This isn't edited like Sailor Moon was, this is edited like THE WHOLE FIRST SEVEN EPISODES OF THE SHOW ARE GONE edited.  There's a reason it's hard to follow, it starts in the middle, and huge scenes are cut, dialogue is cut out, and they give the characters the most ridiculous English names.  Li Shaoran is *not* Sakura's partener, he's simply a supporting character that they [Nelvana] decided to *upgrade* to make the show more interesting to boys (since it was an all the way girl's show in Japan).  But guess what?  When you try to turn a show upside down in dubbing and editing, you just get a crap job that nobody wants to watch, not even the big fans.  Buy the UNEDITED version, and find out what the first seven episodes were about, and where all the characters are supposed to stand in the big picture.

Hardly any of the whimsical air to the orignal version has been spared and has been turned into a less than acceptable piece of policital-correctness by the North American distributor Nelvana. The wonderful plot and characters has been destoryed in favor of drastic character and plot changes, meaningless edits, terrible background music, sub-par voice acting, and the deletion/rearrangment of episodes.
To truly enjoy Card Captor Sakura as it was ment to me, I'd reccomend the subtitled DVD by Pioneer or the orignal manga (at least Mixx's graphic novels or better yet the Kodansha bilingual editions)",977097600,5,723,5.2956521739130435

Nelvana plots to make a profit out of three of the worst episodes. So far, many of the episodes have been dubbed terribly, and edited with unnecessary editing! Changing the original scripts, everything they say is so screwed! They avoid the main word,""love."" They also edit out the fact that Syaoran(Li) and Sakura both like Yukito(Julian). They ""americanize"" everything. Such as the Tokyo Tower, making it a 'tower.' Changing Tokyo to Readington. Everything is just plain bad! Do Americans not need to know where Tokyo or Japan are in this world? Where are the common sense in people these days? This thing is turning out to be worse than Sailor Moon. The voice actors are ruining their voices in each episode. Li's voice is changing in every episode! The episodes that recently came out makes him sound more and more like Kero! Now, come on, don't even buy this tape. It's so horrible that when you buy it, you'll only admire the cover and the animation, but not the voices, excessive editing, and the episode they start with.

First off, the names of the characters are changed. They swapped ""Tomoyo"" for ""Madison""? ...even though they kept ""Li"" and Sakura's names, they pronounce ""Sakura"" wrong, and have the wrong name for ""Li""... his first name is Syaoran... which they changed into the last name, ""Showron"" ...  They also changed where everyone lives. The school of Tomoeda is now Reedington, while Syaoran and Mei-Ling's ""hometown"" (Hong Kong) is never mentioned... what's wrong with being from Hong Kong/Japan?  These are just a few of the major changes made to the show. I think Nelvana underestimates the intelligence of Americans these days... but, It's hard to believe how many people *DO* watch the TV Dub. Folks, there are better things out there! Cardcaptors is a show that has been changed from the magical girl anime with the touches of romance and adventure we have come to love from CLAMP to an insanely censored and emotionless cartoon unworthy of even a one-star rating.

1371054,2,B00004Y56Y,"The series focuses on the main character Sakura, a fourth-grade girl who accidentally unleashes the Clow Cards on the world, and since then, has dealt with fighting and capturing each card with the help of Kero, the guardian seal of the Clow Book, and Li, a descendent of Clow Reed and Sakura's main (oh wait, Meilin doesn't count...*only*) rival.  Everything about the English series, from Madison's newly acquired valley-girl attitude to Li's apparent obsession with the word 'pathetic', detracts from the original enjoyable quality that the CCS series possessed in the Japanese episodes.  My exact complaints?  It's kind of difficult to have an anime that was originally titled ""Card Captor *Sakura*"" revolve around the character Li.  (...hm...and I don't understand the Pokmon allusions here, since CCS has a different storyline, a different plot, and different characters altogether) I will admit that, if you've never seen the Japanese anime version before, then it *is* satisfactorily all right (despite the fact that the parts of the original story were edited out, making story from the English version somewhat...twisted).

7926583,5,B00004Y56Y,"First off, to those who rated this product and any of the other dubbed Cardcaptors products as horrible, I'd like to say something: You only think the dubbed version is horrible because you are used to the subtitled version! I, personally, grew up to the dubbed episodes; and so, when I watch the original Cardcaptor Sakura, I think that /their/ version is horrible. It is all a matter of opinion, and that's that. If you don't like the dubbed version, DON'T BUY IT. Seriously.

Anyway, on to the review.

I've always been a fan of the Cardcaptors series, even though I am just now starting to buy the show on DVD and VHS. The characters were fun, the plot was engaging, and the action was fairly constant. However, I found that sometimes the episodes, when being watched, seemed slightly short and abrupt. That aside, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves anime and fantasy.",1284076800,,887,4.67948717948718
7926584,5,B00004Y56Y,"Let me tell you that this first volume of Cardcaptors will NOT disappoint you. It has 3 exciting episodes. Granted, it is not the first episodes in the series, it's 8, 12, and 17 (Nelvana did dub all 70 episodes, BTW).
So, let me summarize what they are about...

1. ""Sakura's Rival""
Sakura has a mysterious dream of this boy. When she goes to school, a new exchange student arrives, and it's the same boy in her dreams! His name is Li Showron, and he is from Hong Kong.  And also, he is Clow Reed's descendant! Li finds out Sakura was the one who accidently released the cards. Now the Thunder card appears, and Sakura has to go capture it, but Li shows up also. Will they be able to capture it?

2. ""Time and Again""
Sakura had failed her music test. At home, she practiced just to see if she could do it correctly, and she could. Too bad she couldn't do it over again...or so she thought. The Time card is on the loose, and the day rewinds over and over again. Kero has to keep playing Zylon Warrior on a difficult level over and over, Sakura has to keep taking the same music test, and Li always scores a goal when the soccer ball comes flying at him. Will they be able to stop this never-ending time loop?

3. ""The Cave""
Li, Sakura, Madison, and their other classmates, are on a fieldtrip at the beach. One night, they have to go do the ancient shrine walk, where they go in groups of 2 or 3 with a candle to leave a gift at the shrine inside the cave. Sakura is terrified of going inside after Nikki's ghost story, but Madison drags her in. Suddenly, everyone vanishes, and only Sakura and Li are left. Is it a Clow Card, or something else?

For those of you who remember Cardcaptors on Kids WB, these will bring back fond memories. For those of you who have never heard of Cardcaptors, but you love anime, check this DVD out!!!",1235865600,,1833,4.255747126436781

7926586,2,B00004Y56Y,"My husband got interested in the American version of this series (he's a kid at heart), but I just could not stay interested in it. From what I could see, too much of it just did not make sense.

Then, we decided to buy the DVD's for my husband. We bought 3 of them and then I noticed the Sakura/original Japanese version and bought Vol. 1 of that series. We are both now hooked on the original Japanese Cardcaptor Sakura series. The story is delightful to follow and makes the whole thing make so much more sense.

I admit that every now and then we have to hit the pause button so we can read the English subtitles when things get moving fast, but this has in no way dimished our enjoyment.

We highly recommend that anyone interested in this series try the Japanese version.",1152748800,3,777,4.344827586206897
7926587,3,B00004Y56Y,"I began with watching the US version on TV and eventually bought this set a while later to see them again.  I remember enjoying this when I was younger.  However, later on a friend introduced me to the Japanese subbed version.  After I finished watching the japanese series (70 episodes + 2 movies), I was amazed with the depth and richness that the characters had all along.  It was like watching another series all together.

After reading previous reviews, I felt I needed to clear some stuff up.  It is true that this was originally aimed at a young audience, but it was not originally intended for 10 year olds as it is for the US.  With it's more complex story and character development, it's more appropriate for 13-16 (not because of adult content -  it would simply be difficult for the younger audience to understand and appreciate the story).  However, Kid's WB is intended for the younger audience and made changes in an attempt to become entertaining to them.

Also, I read earlier that many character's relationships are homosexual in nature in the Japanese version.  After watching the series, I feel that this is not the case.  For Sakura and Tomoyo/Madison, it is true that they love each other, but this is certainly a plutonic love.  They are simply the closest of friends.  Toya/Tori and Yukito/Julian  share a very similar relationship, but again, nothing more is implied.  Also, Shaoran's ""crush"" with Yukito/Julian is also explained in a very non-homosexual fashion. However, this can be easily misunderstood until that point of explanation.

As for the relationships between different age groups, personally, I think it is a very common and normal thing for a youger (8-12) person to have a childish crush on an older person. Whether this person is a few or several years older, it is something that is even common in our American society (such as with your older sibling's friends or a celebrity).

I even see mention of incest in previous reviews, notably Mihara Chiharu/Chelsea and Yamazaki Takashi/Zachary.  In the American version they are cousins.  However, do not mix this up with the Japanese version. They do have a close relationship in the Japanese version that has potential to go on further, BUT they are not cousins - just childhood friends.

I think the sub/dub voices are both appropriate (although the Japanese version has grown on me better).  They capture their character roles (different for American and Japanese) well enough.  The music was pretty nice in both series.  However, they will often have completely different moods from American to the Japanese version.

Overall, I still like the American version.  It has its own charm.  However, the Japanese version appealed to me in a far deeper sense.  Instead of being simply entertaining to watch, the story went into deep detail about relationships, the background story, and had more involving humor.  10 year olds may not be able to appreciate this because they may not be able to understand it as well  However, for years 13 and up, I would highly recommend watching the subbed version for an entirely different experience.  It has so much more to offer that can appeal to those who can understand its complex story.

I am giving this buy 3 stars because I consider it average to its comparison.  While it is certainly not a bad show or a bad buy, I feel that it is somewhat empty.  And Cardcaptor Sakura (jap version) fills in those gaps with a rich story.",1145059200,8,3460,4.838160136286201
7926588,2,B00004Y56Y,"Cardcaptors:Tests of Courage is my first cardcaptors movie, and I thought it was a little okay, but the more  watched it, the more I realized how different it was from the original series. The characters, relationships,and the whole story is completely different from Cardcaptor Sakura and I no longer like this remake series.  The one thing that bugs me the most is that every piece of evidence to Sakura and Syaoran's relationship was cut out and it looked more like as if they should be rivals in cardcaptors. The big difference in Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura of their relationship is that in Cardcaptors, Syaoran bullied Sakura throughout the series for the cards and never thought about trying to get to know her. Sakura does appear to be annoyed by him, but still tries to get close to him sometimes. And, Sakura and Syaoran don't become friends and start to fall in love with each other until the third season.  In Cardcaptor Sakura, Syaoran did bully Sakura because she had possession of most of the cards. He tormented her during the first half of the first season, and Sakura never had one ounce of hatred towards him and wanted to be friends with him. The tables turn when Syaoran began to treat Sakura with respect when he discovered how bright she was and that she is worthy to become the master of the cards. They quickly become very close friends, and they even fell head over hills in love with each other.",1145059200,3,1428,4.681274900398407
