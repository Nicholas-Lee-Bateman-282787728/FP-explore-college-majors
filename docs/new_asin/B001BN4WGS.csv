3496174,5,B001BN4WGS,"This video is the same style as any other video. Click the camera is in the video, and of course an oh so Diego dilemma. Diego embarks on a journey to find a missing whirly gig beetle dance partner. On the way there is use of Spanish language and some fun bug info on a whirly gig beetle. Apparently if they get into trouble they can release omit a foul odor with the command ""stinky smell"" lol.

Okay enough of the cuteness. Bottom line this video is actually tolerable to watch or let play in the background over and over. I have no problems playing this video on any device that I own. Dvd player, mini dvd player or PS2.",1328400000,5,624,4.2
