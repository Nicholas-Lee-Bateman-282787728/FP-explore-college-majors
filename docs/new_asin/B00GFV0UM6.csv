8622649,4,B00GFV0UM6,"A couple of notes here in that with the stipulation of this being Sting's last title shot if he loses, they showed highlights of each of his TNA Championship wins throughout the night, it was announced that Kurt Angle was the newest member of the TNA Hall Of Fame, and this was the final event for then-TNA announcer Todd Kennely.

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Kenny King vs. Chris Sabin vs. Suicide - This was the 30th Ultimate X Match in TNA history that was filled with such highlights as one man being the odd man out early, a move stolen straight out of Taz's playbook, one man getting spiked on his back twice back to back, one man being suplexed on top of another, one man applying a boston crab before being put into an abdominal stretch himself, and more than one series of one impactful move after another. This was lived up to the standards of the Ultimate X Match as it was some real crazy bumps & very fast paced throughout the match but stay tuned after to hear what Hulk Hogan had to say about the winner.

Samoa Joe, Magnus, Jeff Hardy vs. Aces & Eights (Wes Brisco, Garrett Bischoff, Mr. Anderson) - We got Hulk Hogan ""uncensored"" on the microphone before this match started with the babyfaces very dominate before Aces & Eights were able to single out a member of the team & heavy work over a body part resulting in what was a solid six man tag match that told a good story of both teams trading momentum & everyone looking good.

Sam Shaw vs. Jay Bradley - This was the finals of the mini-tournament between the Gut Check winners with the victor receiving a spot on the Bound For Glory series that saw Shaw be real aggressive & fast paced early while Bradley tried to slow down the pace & keep him grounded before resorting to illegal tactics to keep an advantage. This was just an average match.

Television Champion Devon vs. Abyss - This was originally suppose to be against Joseph Park but he was attacked & left bloody in the back by Devon & Knux allowing Abyss to take his place. This was a pretty short & dominate match that was more about seeing the return after a year (the previous Slammiversary) of Abyss more than anything else.

Elimination Match: Tag Team Champions Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. James Storm & Gunner vs. Bad Influence vs. Austin Aries & Bobby Roode - As you could tell with all the names involved in this match that you were going to get a bunch of action & highlights such as Hernandez showing his almost freakish strength against his opponents & sometimes against two people at a time, the interaction between the former Beer Money partners, the teams attempting to take advantage of any situation through teamwork & even sneaky tactics, and Gunner out to prove himself to his tag team partner. This match was very good & allowed every team to have their moment to showcase themselves at one point.

Last Knockout Standing: Taryn Terrell vs. Gail Kim - Just a correction before I get started but it was said on the commentary that this was the first Last Knockout Standing match when there was one done before at Against All Odds 2011 & O.D.B. had originally replaced Terrell as the Knockouts referee after the previous Lockdown PPV. Knowing the built tension between these two women for months that this match started out slow but picked up quickly with these girls really taking it to each other just just physically with moves like hair whips & figure four leglocks around the ringpost but also using a steel chair in ways that haven't been seen in a womens match from it being sandwiched between the two girls with a top rope crossbody to being thrown head first into the chair wedged in the corner as it just got more physical between the women not only hitting the rampway but going off the ramp as well. This was one of those matches that had no right to be as good as it was because these two women stole the show & had this match being talked about the most at the end of the night to the point where it received the most positive attention in & out of wrestling (even TMZ talked about it) for a womens match that didn't involve a celebrity or a reality show.

Kurt Angle vs. A.J. Styles - This was the first PPV appearance of A.J. Styles since Final Resolution with this being a completely different A.J. than we've seen before complete with new music & a darker look while it should also be noted that it was only a year ago that these men won the Tag Team Titles at this same event. Angle came into this match with his knee taped up which Styles targeted right away with strikes & submission attempts putting pressure on it while Angle worked over the back with a backbreaker & spinebuster & various suplexes including back to back german suplexes as both men traded momentum throughout the contest with counters & reversals for their trademark moves & submissions. This was an awesome match as both men had great sequences of wrestling & reversals & counters along with with intensity throughout the entire match.

No Holds Barred Match: TNA Champion Bully Ray vs. Sting - Sting had the special stipulation on here that he had to win the championship or never challenge for it again causing him to come out hot right from the very start whipping Bully with a belt & sending him into the announce table before Bully was able to come back around giving receipts for what just happened to him before the brawl continued with both men using a chair along with an appearance at ringside including one that was completely unexpected by both men allowing Bully to execute the plan he stated he was going to do in the pre-match interview while a bunch of other weapons were implemented such as a chain, a table, and a very dangerous part of the ring. This was a fun brawl that saw elements used that we haven't seen before that made it stand out.

TNA stepped from their previous Lockdown event as the matches were good to great quality with some coming off way better than you expected coming in (the Knockouts), delivering a nice surprise (Abyss' return), or throwing in a few new elements than we haven't seen in their previous encounters (A.J./Angle & Sting/Bully) so it was one of the best events of that year that I would recommend checking out.",1415836800,,6218,4.515097690941386
8622650,4,B00GFV0UM6,"Overall this show was actually awesome. I have to say it's rare (for me at least) when a TNA ppv dvd is great from start to finish. The Ultimate X match opener is everything you wanted in a good opening match. The Last Knockout Standing match was phenomenal and widely talked about afterwards, and rightfully so. Kurt Angle & AJ Styles had yet another classic wrestling match. The main event was explosive and was a lot better than I thought. Overall just a great show

8622651,4,B00GFV0UM6,"Event itself is fantastic.  I was there live and it was great. The dvd however. ...audio problems on the bonus disc. Immediately issues on the first bonus match. Gets so bad that there is a 2 minute difference between audio and video. Eventually evens out but it's unwatchable. The dvd menus are also super generic. Just a note, doesn't mean anything for the quality of the event, but the menu is literally a still photo and crappy lettering. Looks like an original dvd from the late 90s.",1403308800,,488,4.609195402298851
