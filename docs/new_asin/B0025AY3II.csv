I tried to play it months after buying, so I was well past the point of exchanges or refunds. Do yourself a favor and at least run it when it arrives, so you can exchange promptly if necessary.",1418688000,,314,4.163934426229508
8351032,5,B0025AY3II,"This was an excellent K-drama with Jang Geun Suk is good as ever and Kim Myung Min was superb as the conductor.  The music is a major part of the drama, with romance thrown in.  I definately recommend this drama.  I am slowly filling in my K-Drama library and this is a must have in my book.",1381276800,3,291,4.0701754385964914
8351033,5,B0025AY3II,This if the most outstanding Korean drama I have ever seen.  Kim Myung Min was fabulous and won several awards for his performance.  The cast was wonderful and the music superb.  If you love classical music you will adore this. The story line is exceptional.,1369612800,3,258,4.688888888888889
8351034,5,B0025AY3II,"Not many people understand classical music, today.  Few hear the the humanity found in it. What is often stereotypically depicted is a stuck-up aristocrat...a square.  But not many realize that when Dvorak composed his ""Stabat Mater"" for choir and orchestra, it was literally his musical tears he was shedding for his daughter who passed away.  Not many realize that in writing his ""Piano Concerto #2 in C Minor, Op. 18"" this was Rachmaninov's outpouring of musical emotion after a several month dry spell where he was unable to compose music (imagine not being able to speak and express for a long time).  Classical music, just like our more popular music is filled with human stories of heartbreak and redemption, of joys and anger.

This is something that ""Beethoven Virus"" captures well.  Tons and tons of K-dramas are about the romantic love interests.  But while it is existent in this title as well, it is more so about the music and the way it can open a whole new world to people.  This drama centers around a town orchestra conducted by a world class (but notoriously difficult conductor).  There are many complexities in the plot so I won't even try to give you a slight taste...but all of it makes it an amazing production.  Also, the characters and musicians come from all walks of life and each is memorable, lovable, charming, and important.  You got forgotten orchestra musicians, bar musicians, rock violinists, people that hate classical music, mothers who want to do something that they and their family can be proud of, and much more.  The characters truly make this show come alive.  Every person has a reason for being there, every person has a reason for their choices and tastes, but every person grows together and develops.  Even the tough conductor has his reasons.

The work that the actors and the production team, put into this is astounding.  While accurately capturing what the orchestra life is like for the musicians, they capture the kind of vibrancy of life that is often hard for many musicians to express to others outside of it.  The actors and actresses did their jobs excellently.  In fact they either already knew how to play their instruments or had learned to do so specifically for the show.  In addition, even the conductor went through conductor's training to give a spot on performance.  Enthusiastic authenticity was to the max in this production.

All in all, I found this to be one of the most inspiring shows.  It's a very positive experience and a very heartwarming story...one is drawn to think and meditate on the themes.  It really brings classical music to a new light with very powerful and moving situations.  I even found chills running down my spine in ways I haven't felt in ages.  It reminded me of the raw power and beauty of music throughout the ages and was an inspiration to keep doing music.  Even people who are not classically inclined (I used to be one of them) will begin to see the human story, power, and emotions found in it through this series.  I do admit, many of us classically trained folks sometimes forget the humanity of music with all our knowledge and theories.  But when we look at the lives and letters of our great composers, a thought comes to mind:  An orchestra conductor once penned in an interview (and I paraphrase), a good and worthy musician is not one who is only musically savvy, but one who is also a student of Life as well.  Many of our composers were one's who did not worship music in itself, but allowed the music to resonate from their hearts.  ""Beethoven Virus"" shows the relevancy of music to life very well...and is very very humbling.  Highly recommended :-)",1326240000,5,3667,4.735015772870662
