The first third of the DVD if for beginners, the next third is intermediate, and the last third is advanced intermediate. This DVD is one hour and fifteen minutes long. This is a good supplement to a dance studio's instruction.

It is much better than the Joe Baker's Dance Store Cha-Cha.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-to-Dance-Cha-Cha/dp/B001CFTKIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn to Dance Cha Cha</a>That DVD is almost worthless, because the basic step he uses in all of his patterns is no longer used, at least not in the Arizona, or California.",1252108800,,722,5.747663551401869
