7413714,2,B014IL60TG,"This one had possibilities but fell short. The Pepper guy was supposed to play off the super nice Dr. Love but he fell under her spell almost immediately. All of us baby boomers are having trouble seeing Maureen McCormick as the mother but truth be told she's old enough to be a mother and grandmother. Apparently she's had a face lift or botox because there are no lines on her face. To compensate, they keep her hair pulled back with stringy pieces falling down. In one seen venetian blinds are in front of her so there's not clear view of her face. It's shadows, that apparently the directors though we'd see as lines. And the ending is so interesting. (Not) There's never any questions that the guy is going to go back and get her. There was never any chemistry and very little interaction between her and her so-called boyfriend. The most exciting part of the movie was wondering how many transmissions he messed up to get it to move (if he did). It's on my shelf but if it ""walked away"" I wouldn't be disappointed.",1448496000,,1020,4.489247311827957

And just enough of the right ""mix"" to keep you interested even though the story followed a logical conclusion.

8730893,2,B014IL60TG,"WOW, this movie is SUPER Cheesy, but I watched it anyway.  If you want something with an extra dose of cheese on it, then this is the sappy movie you've been looking for.  Also, what is this, a 16 Candles movie flashback?  What's up with them sitting cross legged, knee to knee on top of a desk having a heart-felt talk and sharing a secret stash of ...... nothing other than grandmas Christmas cookies?  WOW!  Talk about CHEEEEESEEEEEYYYYY!!!!  Also, the acting is terrible, and if this were a believable story then there is no way that the radio dude Pepper would be interested in that radio woman in Colorado that he is put with - it is sooooo contrived.  Cheese, double cheese, triple cheese, oozing with cheese.  This movie is brought to you by CHEESE and a double dose of SAP!  Enjoy (or roll your eyes and have your barf bag ready....)",1514160000,,842,4.4868421052631575
8730894,3,B014IL60TG,"Christmas Mix is a predictable TV movie from 2014, where Haylie Duff plays the same personality wise character she does in all the other Christmas made for TV movies she's in.  This time round she's Sanrda Love, a small Colorado town radio, gives positive advice to callers star.  Somehow this run out of the back of a tourist shop radio station with just three employees, is the sister station to an LA one where a radio shock jock, plays one prank too many, and humiliates the major advertiser on air, claiming the man is cheating on his wife.  The advertiser wants him fired, but Pepper is moved to the sister station temporarily until the heat dies down. He of course doesn't want to go, or to change his ways on or off the air.  He of course treats Sandra with contempt and sees what she tells her listeners as stupid.  You can see where this movie is going from the start.  You've feel from the start for the nice guy radio employee (her boss) as you know how his story is going to turn out.

Maureen McCormack has a cameo appearance as Sandra's mother and plays pretty much herself as the old lady we saw for weeks on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here Australia in 2015 (a year after this), a long way detached from the Marsha Brady character of her youth.  She had a lot of fans on that show, and they'll no doubt enjoy seeing her again.  The overall movie is something that will pleasantly pass the time, but there's nothing memorable in the film, no unique you've got to see this moments.  Basically if you're a huge fan of Haylie Duff or another of the actors you might want to pay money for it, if not just wait for it to be on TV.",1513123200,,1644,4.274193548387097

8730896,4,B014IL60TG,"I'm not sure that I really ever warmed up to Pepper Sterling (Tilky Jones), smirky half of the popular SoCal radio show, Pepper & Spice in the Morning. Pepper is one of them employees who keeps his boss on his toes. And yet it's his inability to toe the line that makes him the hottest radio jockey in L.A. Still, when Pepper inadvertently plays an on-air prank on the station's biggest advertiser, he crosses a line.

For this indiscretion, he gets reassigned - read: exiled - to a sister station in Idyllwild, some bohunk town in Colorado. He, in fact, is ordered to catch the redeye flight to there. In Idyllwild, in a sound studio perched above the gift shop, Wooley's Art & Gifts of the Wild, Pepper is expected to go slumming and partner up with Sandra Love (Haylie Duff), host of Dr. Love in the Morning. Maybe it's his boss back home's twisted idea of punishment, but Sandy Love is a touchy-feely radio shrink who provides counseling on her help line. How's Pepper's dose of snark suppose to fit in?

Except Dr. Love in the Morning is in a ratings slump, so maybe new co-host Pepper - or, as an unimpressed Sandy dubs him, the ""overpaid twit""  - can spice the show up some. Sandy and Pepper immediately get on like two things that don't get on. They're polar opposites. She takes her work seriously. He's into having fun. She's sweet and sincere; she's got a Phd in psychology at Norwestern. He's a cynic whose brand depends on his being edgy and unpredictable. She believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes in the whoopie cushion. And a swag L.A. mansion that comes with a house manager. Sandy's goofy call screener Jonah (Eric Petersen) says of her: ""She was born without a fun gene."" See, Jonah worships Pepper Sterling, big noise in Idyllwild. And since Pepper doesn't have a place to crash during his hated sojourn, Jonah doesn't think twice about offering to share his geek-decorated garage apartment (his mom lives in the main house). Pepper reluctantly takes him up on it.

The station manager serves as the third leg in an unfair romantic triangle, unfair because we suspect form jump that the guy doesn't have a chance. Opposites attract, right? Sandra and Pepper's constant on-air bickering intrigues their radio audience, and, soon enough, their show is a local hit. And, soon enough, there's Sandy and Pepper becoming friends and hanging out. And this taking place during the holidays, there's Pepper's surprising Sandy with ""snow"" in her office, courtesy of tons and tons of packing peanuts substituting as snow. I'll leave it up to you whether their making packing peanut angels is a cute thing or not. NAUGHTY & NICE (a.k.a. CHRISTMAS MIX) is a 2014 Christmas joint that I saw on the UP channel. The wonderful Haylie Duff is the main reason to watch, although it's always lovely catching up with Maureen McCormick, Marcia Brady herself, one of my childhood crushes. As mentioned, I don't know that I ever really warmed up to Tilky Jones' character. The shock jock, smug and crude and not thinking twice about messing with people's lives just to get a cheap laugh, got on my nerves from the start. When he did begin to show a gentler, more caring side, I think I had more of an eye-rolling reaction. NAUGHTY & NICE has its fun moments. I'm not sure the Christmas trappings were really all that needed. The romance unfolds in typical ways. I did think the resolution came a bit too abruptly. I mean, where did Pepper get all those people to help with his grand gesture of affection at such short notice? Still, I say watch the thing for Haylie Duff. She's great as always. 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.",1486944000,,3639,4.645962732919255
