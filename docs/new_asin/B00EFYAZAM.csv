5912021,5,B00EFYAZAM,"Tom Bradford is absolutely the best character in this series. He has the morals and values of the WWII generation and tries coping with his children who are growing up in the ""revolution"" age. He is especially funny when he throws tantrums and engages in yelling matches with his patience-trying children in almost every episode. Although he is definitely not a John ""Daddy"" Walton-type father, he is still a good father is his own imperfect way.",1382918400,5,446,4.881578947368421

5912024,5,B00EFYAZAM,"Reviews about ""Eight Is Enough"" state that sales have been low, but when you can buy Complete Series of other television shows that had 10 or more seasons for under $30.00 many people aren't in to big of a hurry to spend over $50.00 on each season of a TV show.",1378252800,17,261,4.137254901960785

5912032,5,B00EFYAZAM,Been waiting for years for the dvds I have them on vhs but this is easier. I wish it would say on the site how many seasons the show ran so I know that I have another one to buy,1401580800,,177,3.45
5912033,4,B00EFYAZAM,The picture quality is very good given the shows age as is the sound. Disc is well presented with brief detail of each episode and even lists guest stars who appear through the season. Good viewing for fans of 70's & 80's tv shows,1401580800,,230,4.25
5912034,5,B00EFYAZAM,It's too bad that they don't make TV shows like Eight is Enough any more. I grew up as a child watching this show and I am sure glad it's on DVD.,1398470400,,145,3.5625
5912035,2,B00EFYAZAM,Loved season 4 except there is a manufacturers defect on one of the discs so I couldn't watch 3 episodes. Went back to Warner to see if they would replace the one disc...NO!!!! I guess I won't be buying season 5.,1394755200,4,212,4.195121951219512
5912036,3,B00EFYAZAM,"Love, love, love this show but only Season 1 is available in Canada.  I broke down and ordered Season 2 from Amazon.com and it cost $100!!!  $60 for the DVDs, $20 for shipping and handling and $20 for duty and taxes!  On top of that the MOD format won't let me watch it on my laptop!  So frustrating as this was one of the best shows on TV at the time.  I feel like Warner Brothers is punishing us on this one and just making money off of loyal fans.  So sad.  5 stars for the show and 1 star for Warner Brothers for an average of 3 stars.",1394582400,,539,3.889908256880734

5912038,5,B00EFYAZAM,A complete blast from the past!  The Bradfords never disappoint.  Each season is cleverly written and each family member stays true to their character.  70s and 80s life at its best.  Too bad today's TV shows are like Eight Is Enough.,1391299200,6,234,4.634146341463414

5912041,5,B00EFYAZAM,"I loved the way their loving father tried to be supportive of his children, but in the end he still had to act on what he felt was best for them even if they weren't happy about it.  His 2nd wife was also great with the kids.",1386979200,4,225,3.7872340425531914

5912043,5,B00EFYAZAM,Great show for the family.  It makes you laugh and cry.  And makes us older folks remember what it was like to grow up in the late 70's and early 80's..,1384473600,,152,3.870967741935484
5912044,5,B00EFYAZAM,"This is one of the best shows on TV. Where is season five, what is the hold up! Why not have it like Warner Archive, ""They Burn on request"". I can understand to make thousands of copies that may sit on a shelf is not a good business practice.",1383782400,4,242,3.9591836734693877

8605150,5,B00EFYAZAM,"Great season. The clothes are a trip!! The story lines have more depth than previous seasons...Nancy dates a man with a child, Mary falls in love with a married man, Susan contemplates divorce from that dork, Merle. (Too bad she didn't stick to her guns). The episode where Abby feels that she must grieve her late husband (alone) was beautifully acted.",1477180800,,353,4.80327868852459

8605154,3,B00EFYAZAM,Very disappointed.  As with the previous seasons we have purchased they still haven't fixed the sound.  Some have have no sound at at all until 2-3 minutes in.  Many the sound isn't synced with the picture.  Complained about the other three seasons with same problem. It's a shame they don't put out a decent product for the money you pay.,1428364800,,339,4.6
