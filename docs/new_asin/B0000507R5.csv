Other things are view points of The Rock from some people that The Rock don't even knew them, and the picture quality is really bad, and contains notthing, I totally regreted to bought this DVD, if you bought this DVD, you will feel the same way that I feel. Trust Me!! I still cannot believe that The Rock could let them make this DVD for him...",1007942400,,444,4.2976190476190474
8239414,4,B0000507R5,"""Know Your Role!"" That is what we know Dwayne Johnson as WWF superstar The Rock to say. But the Rock's road to superstardom has been a long, tough journey that few people know about, until now. This unauthorized DVD shows the story of Dwayne Johnson from his life growing up on the streets of Miami to his college football days to now, a wrestling idol for kids across the country. I recommend this movie for wrestling fans everywhere.",979430400,,435,4.589743589743589
