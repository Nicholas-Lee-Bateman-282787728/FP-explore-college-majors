8516321,5,B0011WMIEC,"James Reyne. We saw him perform at the Norwood Hotel and thought Wow.
Then we bought the DVD, ""One Night In Melbourne"", better than Wow.  Great opening track, ""Fall of Rome"", good rock music. Then he gives us a selection of tracks from Australian Crawl days to new material. Done in no frills style by a slick 5 piece outfit, no fixes in the studio. Some songs are tastefully performed acoustically, with a sensitive brilliant solo version of ""Reckless."" There is some interview stuff through the DVD about James and how some of the songs were written, not too much, just about all we want. 30 tracks, what a bargain",1231286400,,616,4.6
