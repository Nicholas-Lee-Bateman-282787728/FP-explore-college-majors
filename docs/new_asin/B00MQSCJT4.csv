6600025,5,B00MQSCJT4,"Fantastic footage of KISS. A little disapointed there are no live performance or  song videos on this dvd , only interviews and media events involving KISS. A good collectors piece for any KISS collection.
However the copy pictured feature the Normal KISS logo on the front cover. The copy I was sent features the european KISS logo with the non lightening bolt SS`s.
It also features a photo the current band lineup with Eric Singer and Tomy Thaye on the front coverr and they do not feature in the content of the disc.",1424304000,3,520,4.591397849462366

6600027,2,B00MQSCJT4,"Not what I expected. There is some cool footage, but the KISS logo art work on the Amazon page is not what is on the package, It's the german version. It's billed as ""The Ultimate Story"" and that to me is 1973 to at least 2014 and it was not. I thought the audio quality was poor in some sections and its not even in a wide screen format. There are some clips and interviews I've never seen before, but for the most part I'd say save your money and I consider myself to be a longtime fan.",1422057600,15,488,3.989795918367347
6600028,3,B00MQSCJT4,This is a cool dvd to have. It is unauthorized thus contains no Kiss music and the different logo on the front. Interview footage from almost all eras up to 2001 box set signing in New York. Love the stuff from the '70s where their backs are turned to the camera and they're in street clothes being interviewed thus retaining their 'secret identity'. Pretty long intimate interview from a 1990 Hot In the Shade show right after show ends and they reveal a lot of things not really known til that point. Revenge/Alive III stuff also. And Dynasty backstage footage of the band readying for a show with their wardrobe woman. I had seen some of this stuff here and there but this is conveniently put on two dvds and I found it for fifteen bucks. It's worth it to a Kiss nerd like me and the humor/banter between the guys is hysterical at times! I'm giving it three stars. Enjoy!,1421539200,9,874,4.434782608695652

8674065,1,B00MQSCJT4,"Gave this to my husband for Christmas. He watched them today, the second disc doesn't work!! The first one was fine. The second disc plays a little bit, freezes then goes back to the main menu. He tried over and over same result. This is clearly a defective disc and should be replaced.",1451779200,,286,4.415094339622642

This is not Kiss rather, The Gene and Paul Show with contracted musicians Tommy and Eric.
Though Eric is a terrific drummer He is Not Peter Criss . Peter had a Rock Swing  beat . Eric is so fluid that he looks like a robot as Dose Tommy Thayer
The same can be said of Tommy Thayer . He for one looks nothing like Ace Frehley in the Make Up nor does he play with that Rock swagger That Ace has.
I just saw the Gene and Paul Show  on you Tube at the  House Of  Blues, Small Stage no Pyros and Lip Syncing
 They should have One Last show with Peter and Ace. They would Generate enough money to satisfy even Gene .",1444608000,,620,3.888888888888889
