8055026,5,B00080OB84,"I have watched close to 100 films on WWII and this was the best one, hands down. It tells the story of how the Germans suffered under Hitler and the Nazis, and gave much insight into the after the war problems, such as the struggle between the Americans and Soviet over control of Berlin. It was not only Americans and the British and Russians that suffered, the Germans did as well. The film also gives much insight on how the most education nation on earth at the time could be mislead by the Nazis and Darwin's inferior race theory. This film should be a lesson to the world about criminal governments and science based on the leading ""authorities"".",1517270400,,652,4.533898305084746
8055027,4,B00080OB84,I have read several critical reviews and beg to differ. Who but the postwar Germans would be least inclined to make biased statements or to seek a propaganda outlet for their production? This documentary is the best historic account of their final battle in WWII.,1343865600,2,263,4.866666666666666
8055028,5,B00080OB84,A pro Soviet documentary that features outstanding footage of the bloody Battle for Berlin. You'll see Soviet artillery pounding German positions. You'll witness Soviet infantry clearing buildings occupied by German defenders. Soviet armor as it rolls through the streets of Berlin. I was impressed by the quality of the classic footage. I recommend this video for anyone interested in World War two especially eastern front combat.,1342310400,,432,5.5606060606060606
8055029,1,B00080OB84,This is a completely different film than the one that's advertised. Please replace the information. This is a German film by Franz Baake and Jost Von Morr. People who are looking for the Soviet film by Yuli Raizman will be very disappointed.,1273017600,7,241,4.761904761904762
8055030,1,B00080OB84,"Those seeking Yuli Raizman and Elizaveta Svilova's famous 1945 documentary should know that this item is being sold under false pretenses. This is a 2005 film using old footage prepared by Chronos Films. It is NOT the Soviet original, contrary to what Amazon says on its website. I was fooled but hopefully you will not be.--SL, NYC",1226361600,20,332,4.842105263157895
