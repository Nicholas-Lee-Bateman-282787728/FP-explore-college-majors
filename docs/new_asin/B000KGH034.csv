8156549,2,B000KGH034,"If you like burlesque with pasties, this might be a 4-star review as the two main features are essentially burlesque with pasties interrupted/split by vaudeville acts. If you're throwing some time machine stag party, you might it useful but otherwise for the average viewer, it's not particularly exciting nor interesting. If the burlesque offered real nudity, that would add a star. What's also leaves a lot to be desired is that the women while presumably burlesque stars of the 1950's/1960's - when, of course any little bit of skin was taboo and enticing, to us now, they sort of seem like someone's aunt doing a striptease. There are about 6 per ""film,"" and out of the 12 or so performing, a couple still come off as attractive but that's a pretty low ratio - then compound that with there is no real nudity (they have pasties covering the three fun zones), there is not much here if you just want sexy.

Dream Follies attempts to come up with a plot about a guy peeking into a show but it doesn't really add anything since it's the same format as Dreamland Capers. Lenny Bruce is one of the vaudeville acts.

The ""bonus"" film, ""Dance Hall Racket"" also features Lenny Bruce - he's obviously not much of an actor (yet) but fans might want to check it out. The plot is about a (Taxi) Dancing business and that it's not on the up and up (imagine that!). Also, no nudity - the taxi dancers do spend time in their dressing room in lingerie and underwear but compared to other SOMETHING WEIRD films, this is very tame. While there are teases during changing or showering, there is no real nudity and the women most look authentic as taxi dancers, if you know what I mean.

While there are the usual fun trailers and stills of burlesque posters, the extras again only appeal to fans of old time burlesque. There are interviews with some of the performaers ... and not to be rude, if they didn't seem all that sexy or attractive at 20-35, imagine what they look like now - 50 years later ...).

So, a fine historical disc but as a fun, sexy, typical SOMETHING WEIRD DVD - not so much.",1208995200,11,2081,4.482849604221636
