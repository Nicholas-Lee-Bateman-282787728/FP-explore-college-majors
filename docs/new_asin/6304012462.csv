2561901,5,6304012462,"Well, what more can I add to the dooby's review, which is excellent (I based on it when decision on buying this DVD came to my mind)? Not that much, probably some subjective emotional expessions.

When I was watching this movie I'd had a feeling that this is probably the one and only example of this kind. The movie has a funny story-line, there are music, songs and choreography, but not a single sign of what the modern hardcore production is about. There was a spirit of the time and.... it was fun!

Maybe this movie doesn't offer what the modern understanding of XXX implies, but we have to understand the difference between those who went on exploring the area of adult movie industry in 70-s and 2000-s. This dramatical issue (among the others) is being discussed in ""30 years of Alice In Wonderland"" 37-minute-length featurette (which I think is very informative and interesting).

Pure and innocent. Or maybe I am wrong? Well, watch this movie and tell why if it is so.",1205452800,28,979,4.6473988439306355

2561903,4,6304012462,"I first saw this movie nearly 20 years ago on VHS. I ignored it for awhile until one evening I was looking for some movies before the weather
turned bad. I picked this up and decided it would probably be a loser. How wrong I was. This movie stands out above all others in this genre. The production quality was outstanding from start to finish. I thought that I would be doing the FF thing, or just stopping it and rewinding it, instead, I watched and really enjoyed this movie. I rennted it on several ocassions afterwards, and always seemed to notice something I had missed. The VHS version was the theatrical ""X"" rated version, although it would probably be a hard ""R"" today. Have I ordered the DVD? You bet I have,as I think it will make a fine addition to my varied collection. This is really a fun & funny movie, but definately not the Alice in Wonderland for kids. I am not at all surprised to see the high ratings for this movie, in fact I would be surprised by anything less. Charlie S.",1202860800,37,995,4.32620320855615
2561904,5,6304012462,"A young librarian makes a trip from a staid library desk after a tiff with her boyfriend. Being a librarian dealing with books, where is there  a better place to work out one's internal personal demons than by taking a mental trip to a wonderland of one's own devisement. Her problems are dealt with through various meetings and conversations with characters she meets in her dream of a trip. She resolves her internal difficulties to her satisfaction as we are given approximated visual descriptions of how she struggles with her problems.

2561905,4,6304012462,"Bravo to Subversive Cinema for finally bringing this gem to DVD. And to Amazon for making it widely available. This DVD contains both the X-rated and the XXX version of this infectiously happy little porno. A true classic from the Golden Age of porn.

This Alice is for adults only. The story is straight out of Lewis Carroll. Except that Alice is older. She's a small town librarian. A 20-year-old virgin and a prude. But Alice is the hottest prude you'll ever meet. Kristine DeBell was the Playmate and Playboy Centerfold for June 1976. She is the cutest little hottie, with her tiny upturned nose, petite body, all natural assets, and neatly trimmed bush (this was the 70s).

After a tiff with her horny boyfriend, prudish Alice learns all about sex in her daytrip to Wonderland. Her guides are Lewis Carrol's famous cast of characters. With a twist.

The Mad Hatter is a flasher with a 9-inch schlong. Humpty Dumpty falls off his wall and needs Alice to ""blow"" him up again. The White Rabbit is a perv who likes spying on Alice as she plays with herself. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are incestuous twins who can't get enough of each other. They show Alice how to get it on. The King's knights are Gay. The King is a Bongo playing African who speaks in painfully tortured rhyme (70s rap?). The Queen is a leather clad Dominatrix who takes a liking to Alice. And enjoys having her eat at her box. Alice is finally deflowered by the Texaco pump attendant (her boyfriend). It is a total laugh riot.

It may be porn but it's not like any porn you've ever seen. With fully choreographed song and dance numbers. Broadway Style and performed with gusto. A constant stream of witty one-liners. And naked flesh galore. Don't know if Kristine does her own singing but she sounds great. Just imagine, a singing, dancing Playboy Bunny. What more could you ask for. If you want sleaze, this is not for you. It is not nasty sex. It is just pure fun. Innocent fun. Even with the hardcore footage restored it remains sweet and innocent. And the cornball jokes never stop coming. Sample:

Alice eyeing the Mad Hatter's shrivelled dick with horror: ""Oh my goodness... Are you alright? ... I thought I'd broken it.""
Scrug to a wet Alice: ""We don't have any towels. We had one once but a hotel stole it away.""
Alice, as the Muggie licks her all over: ""It feels good... If it feels good, there's a good chance it must be bad.""
Humpty Dumpty falls and breaks his balls and everyone sings: ""He can't get his ding-a-ling up."" (Song)
Queen to Alice: ""I don't want to cut off your head, I want you to give me some head.""
Alice to girl impaled on Knight: 'What's a girl like you doing on a Knight like this?"" (Song)
King to Gay Knight on Horseback: ""Stay on the Nag, Fag.""
King to Alice: ""May My Rod and My Staff Comfort thee.""

This Limited Storybook Edition DVD (30th Anniv.) contains the 72min X-Rated Theatrical cut (softcore) and the complete 81min XXX original (hardcore). It also comes with a 37min documentary featuring interviews with Adult Film practorian, Bill Margold, Porn Star and Feminist Critic, Lena Ramone and Larry Gelman who played the White Rabbit. Sadly Kristine DeBell was not involved. The films are presented in their original 1.85:1 widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TV). The X-rated version (softcore) has been fully restored and is as near perfect as you'll probably ever get to see Alice. The XXX version (hardcore) varies in quality depending on the state of each restored hardcore element. Multiple defects still remain. But it's more than acceptable. Sound is in the original Mono. Worth the price? Absolutely. Alice is delightful. It's light and breezy. It's full of fun. It'll leave you happy and smiling. It'll have you humming along with its silly tunes. They just don't make shows like these any more. And Kristine DeBell never looked more adorable than here.

Note: No other Extras are included. The originally proposed soundtrack audio-CD has been axed. The Limited Storybook Edition which I bought from Amazon doesn't have any storybook. Just the single DVD.

PS. Kristine does indeed do all her own hardcore scenes. All except the final deflowering. The defloration closeup uses a body-double. Apparently Kristine did sing all Alice's songs as well. An amazingly multi-talented girl.",1200096000,164,4300,4.77792732166891

2561930,5,6304012462,"It looks like the listing now on amazon, subtitled ""An Erotic Comedy,"" is one of the numerous censored edits, released by Historic Erotica.  Judging from the cover, I SERIOUSLY question the legitimacy of this release (and am willing to bet that it's a VHS dupe).  So for the benefit of the many who have written irate reviews of this disc...

Back in 2007, the now-defunct distributor Subversive Cinema released it on DVD as ""an Adult Musical Comedy"" with a banner on the top of the box front denoting it as the ""Limited Storybook Edition"" and a sole photo adorned the back of Kristin DeBell in a rocking chair, pouting and clutching a stuffed white rabbit. This disc includes two edits of the film, a softcore X-rated version, a hardcore XXX version, and a few interviews (mostly forgettable comments from people who weren't directly involved with the production, though White Rabbit Larry Gelman was featured).  Originally Subversive announced that they'd include an R-rated version, a CD soundtrack, and theatrical trailer but none of this materialized with their release (though the trailer was streaming on their also-now-defunct website).  Subversive had problems tracking down all of the original film elements so there were some issues with obvious lines and splices (particularly in the XXX version), but overall they did a nice job with the film transfers.  I bought my copy from amazon, just tracked it back in my order history and discovered that page is gone.  However, if you click the ""Additional DVD options"" near the top of the ""Erotic Comedy"" page, it looks like you might be able to buy the uncensored Storybook Edition on another amazon page.

ALICE IN WONDERLAND (1976)
The film was produced by adult film mogul Bill Osco, the producer of the first mainstream adult film, Mona (1970), and its sequel Harlot (1971), as well as the comedy/stop motion effects hit, Flesh Gordon (1974). Osco chose to make as his next project a musical soft-core version of the Lewis Carroll novel, finding that the story rights were in the public domain. The result was an X-rated feature which was picked up by 20th Century Fox, who cut three minutes to obtain an R-Rating. An interesting little know fact about the original theatrical release of Bill Osco's Alice in Wonderland, is that it was released by 20th century Fox and played as part of a double bill with Star Wars. Alice went on to gross over $90 million worldwide, thus making it one of the most successful adult films in history. At the time it received the following review from ROGER EBERT:
ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a genuine curiosity: An X-rated musical comedy that actually has some wit and style to it. It's also fairly mild, as X movies go; it could almost be an R, and it's sexy rather than offensive. Maybe because I went with low expectations, I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And its most pleasant surprise is its star, Kristine De Bell, who projects such a freshness and naivete that she charms us even in scenes where some rather alarming things are going on. I think she has a future in the movies, and not just X movies, either; there's an openness to her expression, a directness to her acting, that's genuinely appealing.",1357430400,3,1656,4.594594594594595

2561981,5,6304012462,"If you buy the DVD or tape, chances are you are going to get the soft porn version. During the mid 70's Drive-In porn was 90% soft core with 10% hard core. Alice in Wonderland was one of a series of fairy tale adult films that all seemed to have come out in short succession.

This one was different as it starred Kristine De Bell, whose appearance in porn provided more excitement than the Ivory Snow girl. This story is about discovering yourself as an extension of the 60's sexual revolution, including the soundtrack. The lines were as corny then as they are today. Certainly details of the film are immaterial, other than that in the XXX version, Ms. De Bell does all those things you would pay to see her do including girl/girl and the oral scene with the Mad Hatter which appears as a sign claiming the scene is deleted in the soft core version.

2561983,4,6304012462,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1975 Adult version...
I think it is great that someone made an adult movie based on Alice in Wonderland. Why? Mainly because the Alice story has manifested in virtually all other formats (cartoons, musicals, plays, ballets, operas, etc.), so why not?

So what are you getting into if you watch this movie? First let's touch on the sex, because that's what everybody cares about. I viewed only the harder to find original uncut version (downloaded it from Youtube). It wasn't that I wanted to see the sex per se, I wanted to see the movie the film makers intended to make. I can tell you that the sex is definitely explicit. Explicit explicit. However, these passages are not long and drawn out. This is not a porno film with some Alice in Wonderland dialog. This is a movie that has a storyline, and that storyline is a transposition of Alice, instead of dealing with the issues of growing up in general, is more specifically dealing with the issues of maturing into a sexual being. It's life folks. So yes, there's some outright porn... but in fact this production is really ""erotica"".

The movie is piloted by young, pretty, sexy, and slightly barely legal 21 year old Kristine DeBell. She's great!

An example of how Carroll's plot lines were transposed into sexual themes would be instead of Alice running in circles in a Caucus race to dry off from the pool of tears, the animals lick her dry. Ooooh.

Another example is Humpty Dumpty has a broken... you know. And, they showcased Tweedledee and Tweedledum as brothers and sister in love with each other. Ha ha.

The writers are clever, and they extend Carroll's tendency to play on words into the topic of the movie. The movie is actually full of humor. There are many dance numbers using actual dancers... It's a musical. A comical, sexy, musical. What's not to love?

2561987,4,6304012462,"The first time I saw ""Alice"" was on VHS years ago.  The edit of the movie on that tape was somewhere between the ""R"" rated version on this DVD and the ""XXX"" version available only in the ""Storybook Edition.""  After watching the ""R"" cut from the storybook edition, I was surprised at how jarring many of the cuts really were.  The version on the VHS tape had no hardcore footage, but had plenty more nudity and debauchery than the ""R"" version on the DVD.

If you are interested in this movie, you are interested in seeing the ""XXX"" version.  Even if you, for some reason, want to see this movie but aren't interested in seeing hardcore, the ""R"" version is a lame alternative, as it has been chopped to bits or utilizes cropped versions of ""XXX"" shots to achieve the ""R"" (for example, Alice sitting on the rock).

There are lots of angry reviews posted by people who accidentally bought the ""R"" version thinking they were getting the ""Storybook"" with both ""R"" and ""XXX.""  From what I can tell, the storybook is out of print, meaning you have to buy it from an independent seller.  E-mail the person first to make sure the DVD is listed as having both versions of the movie.  I purchased my NEW copy of the storybook from an independent seller for less than the ""R"" version is listed on Amazon!

Both versions are on one disc, and I was expecting two seperate discs, so make sure when you get one disc you check to make sure it only has the ""R"" version.  It's a lot of hassle, for sure, but it IS a good movie, and worth it if you are interested.  Things like this simply aren't made any more, and in spite of the handful of different DVD releases from the past few years, all essentially with identical packaging but containing very different material, it IS possible to find what you are looking for at a reasonable price.",1323820800,7,1821,4.419161676646707

2561989,5,6304012462,"Most porn I've seen ends up being a turn-off. This movie was a most definite turn-ON. Kristine Debell make Alice's innocence so real and believable. There are enough reviews with a synopsis, so no need to do so again here. However, some details that may be of interest:

Alice wears a skimpy, not opaque outfit (or nothing) throughout the movie. I consider that outfit an outfit for the ultimate tease. As you watch the movie you are getting constant glimpses of the goodies, including fuzz. Of the female performers in the movie, Alice is wearing something more often than the rest. (Fortunately, for the most part, the males keep their clothes on.) Other females have full frontal often (including fuzz), but not Alice. Her full frontals are more rare, but with the enticement her outfit brings, you appreciate more the frontals. (Only the XXX version has full frontals of Alice. There is no full frontal of Alice in the X version.)

The music is good, choreography is good, acting is so-so, but Kristine Debell makes you not notice anything but her. There is a superficial plot, but again, so what. This film looks like it had more of a budget than other so-called porn films. This film is considered porn, but is leagues above others. There should be a movement to force porn producers to make more movies like this Alice in Wonderland.

The difference between X and XXX versions? More is shown in the XXX version. Don't want to spoil the anticipation. I would suggest watching the X version first for the tease, then follow-up with the XXX version.

Watch this movie, but most definitely keep it away from any kiddies. And by kiddies, I mean under 24. If you can watch it with your partner, you'll have a memorable time (and a lot of sheets to wash later).",1319760000,4,1761,4.670967741935484

2561996,4,6304012462,"First, for the Alice purists, this is ""Alice-inspired"" rather than Alice (if you'll pardon the expression) straight up. Second, in case any doubt remains, this is for the grownups only. If seeing a childhood favorite recast as erotic entertainment offends you, you came to the wrong place.

If you're still with me, you might find some old-fashioned entertainment here. This dates from the 1970s, so you'll find it very different from modern porn. For one thing, it has some vague semblance of plot. Nothing memorable, but a plot nonetheless, and even some pretensions to being a musical. For another, the actors look like actual huamn beings - I find natural busts more elegant and varied than the silicone sameness so common in more recent adult films, so that was a real plus. Most importantly, though, a sense of fun pervades that just never appears much any more. When that cheerful, consensual aspect is missing, I'm just not interested.

Don't get your hopes up too far. Acting is weak, special effects aren't very special, and the sex scenes could be juicier. Despite all that, it's still good fun. And, if you wonder where the recent Burton/Depp ""Alice"" got the idea for the leading lady's filmy, flimsy, accident-prone attire, this might be it.

I got the extended version and, yes, it extends all the sex scenes. Although this caused things to drag a little on some scenes (mostly the Mad Hatter scene), the extra footage was mostly welcome. My favorite extended scene has to be Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee. The pair were played by an actual married couple and you could feel how in love they were just by watching them. Watching them make love was actually very beautiful; I didn't want it to end!

Kristine DeBell was and still is the best Alice hands down. I was so glad to see that they added the deleted scenes and had a choice between X and XXX version.  If you're looking for an entertaining and at times funny porn, you can't lose with this one and don't worry there are plenty of close ups for you hard core lovers.",1229385600,,488,3.9292929292929295
2562012,4,6304012462,"Those of us who are fans of the ""Drive-In"" movie genre have long been familiar with this quirky, sexy take on Alice's adventures. The ""R"" rated version shown in the 70's was strangely charming, making Alice seem both delightfully naive and extremely sexy. The original songs and musical numbers ranged from cute to downright stupid, and the movie is wildly uneven in every way, but it is one of those flicks that you can revisit and still enjoy.

This DVD version features both the ""R"" and ""X""-rated versions of the movie. I always wondered how much had been left on the cutting-room floor, as some of the scenes were obviously toned-down. This DVD answered my questions and surprised me, as well. I found that (for once) LESS is MORE. The X-rated version has more of everything - explicit sex, longer scenes, etc. Sadly, it loses the innocent quality that made the movie one of my favorites. The explicit sex makes the film seem tawdry, tacky and tasteless.

HOWEVER -- this DVD contains BOTH versions of the film. My recommendation is to watch the R-rated version first. If you are curious, then watch the X-rated film, but I'll bet that when you take it off the shelf next time, you'll go back to the ""R"".

If you like the unusual, and are not easily offended by nudity, then buy this DVD. This telling of Alice's adventures will make you smile (and maybe leer a little).",1220659200,4,1374,4.622950819672131

""Alice In Wonderland"" is a carefree 1976 musical sex comedy that has endured in popularity; it holds a unique place in adult films. Though ""Alice"" was shot with some hardcore sex scenes, the maker or distributor (20th Century Fox!) chose to delete the explicit footage before the movie was released. Thanks to abundant nudity, and the sparkling presence of pretty Kristine DeBell, the now hard R/soft X feature became a popular and highly profitable staple on the drive-in theater circuit.

Miss DeBell was a Ford agency fashion model before making ""Alice."" In April 1976 she appeared on the cover of Playboy; the photo came under fire from anti-pornography zealots because it portrayed her as an underage schoolgirl. While never a ""Playmate,"" Kristine also was pictured au natural in the August issue as part of a Helmut Newton photo feature. After ""Alice,"" she moved on to roles in the Bill Murray comedy ""Meatballs"" and other mainstream films. Her TV credits include the role of Judge Harry Stone's rock star girlfriend Jennifer Black in an episode of ""Night Court,"" and a stint on ""The Young and the Restless.""

In the early 1980s ""Alice"" was released on home video with the deleted footage restored, though the theatrical version was more widely available. The ""Limited Storybook Edition"" contains both the XXX and soft X versions; the Playboy cover photo is included on the back of the DVD case. The explicit footage is slightly abbreviated, most noticeably in Alice's massage scene, and has significantly more scratches, jumps, color shifts, etc. than the version released by Xtravision in the '80s.

What has always made ""Alice"" appealing is its lighthearted treatment of sex. In this pre-HIV world, lovemaking is presented as risk-free fun; the silly jokes, catchy songs, and dance choreography make it unlike any other adult film in memory. An above average actress for this genre, Kristine DeBell projects refreshing sincerity, enthusiasm, and innocence (her fresh-faced cuteness and natural body don't hurt, either). Well worth watching.",1213574400,17,2205,5.553571428571429
