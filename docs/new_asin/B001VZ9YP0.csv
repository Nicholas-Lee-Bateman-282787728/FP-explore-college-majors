3823689,1,B001VZ9YP0,Said it has the bonus episodes of the specials. The DVD I recieved did not.  False advertising! I was not happy I believe you should get what you pay for. They are selling these DVDs under false pretenses.,1333324800,3,205,4.394736842105263
3823690,4,B001VZ9YP0,"I just can't believe how well organized this family is!  Such great values!  The only reason I give it 4 stars is due to... I order the DVD with the bonus scenes and did not receive it, I received a regular DVD.  Oh Well!  Other than that, they will always be a 5 star rating in my books!",1322265600,5,288,3.913793103448276

3823693,5,B001VZ9YP0,"As of writing this, I have bought another DVD for my extended family overseas.

I have the DVDs '17 and Counting' and '18 and Counting,' also their book.

I have spent money on nonsensical trinkets, clothing, books and more. Why not learn from one of America's inspiring families?

I'm not so surprised with huge family members. Asia and some poor regions of the world have more than 12 babies at times. The great about this family is how they have solid foundation in the Lord Jesus (Christian values) and rules not to go beyond their means.

Like most people, I have reservations about having a big family. But since they live in America, why not? Look at  China, some European nations, Japan and Korea with declining population rate or disparity in gender, the consequences are alarming.

If they can skimp on non-essential expenses and maintain their debt-free status, I think this is something to behold. I admire it so much because we live in a domino-effect greed. Wall street greed to global greed to the point we live beyond our means.

The Duggars help me realize that my days can be useful with sheer family fun instead of stuffing my closet with junk.  I hope to be more frugal.

As a Christian woman, their lives help me meditate...meditate...and more meditation with lots of prayers for answer on how to walk the talk of a Christ-centered life. Living in NY, Im drawn to me, mine, and myself.

I hope to impart their lives to my daughter when she grows up.

VERDICT : Great buy! A realy family-oriented DVD. No demeaning language, mom-dad fights etc...",1274745600,18,1566,4.6996336996337
3823694,4,B001VZ9YP0,"I've never missed an episode of the Duggar family, and when I found out that this dvd set was coming to Amazon, I jumped all over it. I had it preordered the minute I found out. When I received the dvd, I got excited to watch all the old specials, and so it was immediately popped into my dvd player. However, I realized after starting the dvd set, that the 4 bonus features were on another dvd. The explanation on both sides of the case said it has 4 bonus features, but that isn't the case. Can anyone fix this?!",1265155200,10,514,4.15
3823695,1,B001VZ9YP0,"Amazon advertised this item as a ""2pc"" set.  They titled the item ""17 Kids and Counting (2pc)"" and they showed the picture of the dvd case sleeve that clearly stated that this item ""Includes 4 Bonus Features.""  When I received this item, there was only one disc in the case, and there were NO bonus features on the disc at all.  There were 10 regular episodes, but there were NO bonus features....even though the dvd case sleeve clearly stated on both sides that the item ""Includes 4 Bonus Features"" and even names the four titles of the bonus features on the back of the case.  Very disappointing.

Very annoying and to get it we have to buy this DVD again someplace else ?",1406246400,,379,3.935064935064935

3823730,5,B001VZ9YP0,"My wife and I are having our fourth child next spring, and she wanted this so she could get some fresh perspective as well as some tips that may help us. As always, the Duggars delivered (no pun intended, lol)! We have thoroughly enjoyed this series, along with the first few that we have. What an encouragement!",1378339200,,312,4.491228070175438
3823731,5,B001VZ9YP0,"Some people hear the name ""Duggar"" and immediately roll their eyes and say, oh those ""quiverfull"" movement people with too many kids... I'm fairly certain the Duggars have specifically said the quiverfull movement isn't their ""goal"" so to speak.

In any case, this is a delightful family. They can afford their children and they are all well behaved kids with their own personalities. How can you complain about that?

I'm from the generation that supports shows like Teen Mom and 16& Pregnant, and makes the people featured on those shows ""celebrities"" and ""stars""... In a world that shows constant footage of those girls, I'm glad there is a show like 17 (now 19) Kids & Counting to combat that.  If you have extremes in one direction, it's good to have a balance in the other.

All of that said, the dvds arrived in good condition! This season isn't my favorite (I feel it's a little slow, and they haven't quite figured out the filming style/direction yet), but if you're looking to purchase all of them, you can't really skip the first ;)

A good buy, a good show that you can watch with kids in the room, and a good family!",1373500800,,1129,4.597014925373134
3823732,1,B001VZ9YP0,"Amazon really needs to get their stories straight about this DVD, when I ordered the DVD it showed the bonus material, what I received was a DVD without the bonus features. When I went back into the product there had been a note added saying the bonus material was not included. This note was NOT there when I ordered because I read the entire product from top to bottom and all the reviews, simply because I wanted to make sure I was ordering the correct one and because the reviews of the product are about 50/50 with people receiving what they thought they ordered. I believe this is false advertising!! Here is a thought Amazon, change the picture if you are not going to send the product that we ordered! I will update further if Amazon corrects THEIR mistake. But the Duggars are an amazing family and an inspiration to everyone!",1366588800,10,835,4.5364238410596025
3823733,5,B001VZ9YP0,"It's so great that there is finally a wholesome family being promoted on television. What a relief to see morals and character displayed in our living room. Genuine fun, family, laughter and faith. There are children's cartoons I won't let my child watch, but have no problem with this running in the background while we play.

3823735,5,B001VZ9YP0,Wholesome Christian family with absolutely no inappropriate language or innuendo (something extremely rare in today's television).

3823737,5,B001VZ9YP0,"We DVR 19 Kids and Counting and wanted to see the 1st season. They are such a good example of a good family to look up too. I have gotten a lot of parenting wisdom from watching Jim-Bob and Michelle. My husband and our 8 month old like the show. Every time our son hears Michelle naming the names at the beginning of each episode, he will turn to the tv and start watching. I was happy to find it for a good price and free shipping. They also changed the cover so that it doesn't say it has the bonus msterial, because it doesn't.",1340755200,,530,4.057142857142857
8346817,3,B001VZ9YP0,"For me painful to watch. Parents take joy in child production then hand out family photographs when they meet surprised people. They go on TV to announce another child is to be born, the children aspire to appear happy but they all seem...to dread ANOTHER KID cutting in on their already limited time with parents. The children are responsible for watching the little children, one gets lost at the airport, DFS DOES NOT GET INVOLVED!

They have some friends who also have a big family and they visit for a Trip to Silver Dollar City. Talk of faith, clothes, and shopping at the THRIFT STORE...FOR SHOES THAT OTHER PEOPLE WORE! HUGE FOOD SHOPPING! Appear on Korean TV. Show homemade hygiene products, wonder exactly how much homemade products they create? ICK!

Oldest son asks a gal to a marry him, they will court. (He eventually gets caught up in internet horn dogging). To me this is sad to put children through this behavior. I am a child of a parent who was one of fifteen, NOT AN EASY EXISTANCE! It follows a person in their thinking and behavior.",1524009600,,1054,4.6310160427807485
