8153978,2,B000K2Q78C,"Wow. I've seen a lot of biker movies, but I've never seen anything like ""Pink Angels."" These six angels are on their way down the California coast to a cotillion, and they are dressing to the nines. Given that this was made in 1971, these openly gay bikers and their opponents play to grotesque stereotypes that are stunningly flamboyant. They are opposed at every turn by harassing cops, straight bikers (including a young but still grizzly Dan Haggerty,) and a somewhat insane General (George T. Marshall) whose mission is unclear, but somehow involves the eradication of debauchery. (It's pretty clear where the conflict is going to be here.)

The gang members vary in their degree of femininity: Ronnie dresses the most flamboyantly in a form-fitting snakeskin dress (with matching shoes and purse,) while Liverpudlian Eddie is the most overtly submissive member of the group. The others are somewhat more masculine, at least until they speak or don their dresses. The gay and straight bikers have a (very) long party with some local girls that pads the running time of the film enormously, though all doesn't end well.

Eventually they reach the hotel for the dress ball, and there's a bizarre and mercifully brief subplot about an inappropriately dressed room service attendant selling drugs. (Her services are declined, but watch for the humorously inserted ""Moo!"" sound effect.) After a lengthy shopping spree (which, again, pads the film) the gang all gets into drag and goes to the hotel bar, where they are quickly intercepted by the gang of straight bikers, who, of course, don't realize they are men and immediately start chatting them up, foreshadowing bizarre romantic interludes later.

Meanwhile, the government is in their business via the General, who is monitoring them and plotting their position on the ""Top Secret Map"" on his wall. Sirens blare, the troops go to high alert, and one of the Pink Angels is captured. Of course the General (who reminds me more than a little of ""Dr. Strangelove's"" General Jack Ripper,) begins the interrogation not realizing that this homely woman is really a man, but he is quickly set straight. The film then immediately cuts to an EXTREMELY abrupt concluding scene that I certainly didn't expect (nor will I spoil it for you.) It's all a bit of a letdown and seems like it can't possibly be what was originally envisioned.

The film is certainly unique, and while it sounds controversial, aside from the gratuitous room service matron and the jarring conclusion, there is really a lot less offensive material here than you might expect. I'm glad I finally saw this legendarily strange movie, but I suspect that once will definitely be enough.",1322006400,3,2699,5.00445434298441
8153979,4,B000K2Q78C,"What do you get when you cross a 70s exploitation flick with the '90s drag-queens-on-a-road-trip movies like ""Priscilla"" or ""Too Wong Foo""? The answer is 1971's ""The Pink Angels"", that's what.

A sextext of bikers including the brooding leader, a big burly bear, a short bitchy bulldog, a transplant from Liverpool, the token black and a bland one with a fake moustache trek along the coast to their final destination--a drag ball in L.A. There's an odd subplot involving a military General who's inventing strategies in his office, but the plots don't intersect until the last 10 minutes.

The story and acting are by no means great, but the production values are surprisingly good for drive-in fare like this.

There's plenty of footage of the cast riding around while cut-rate Harry Nilsson/Stephen Stills-type music plays on the soundtrack.

Some of the highlights include a food fight at the A & W; an orgy that ensues when another biker gang joins their picnic and the Pink Angels rustle up some women folk. The biggest nympho is an old Hermione Baddeley lookalike who's all over the lead biker. Grizzly Adams suckles the bare breast of a negress. When everyone passes out from all the booze and weed, the Pink Angels make over the other bikers in lipstick and ribbons, then split.

The rival gang tracks them down at a hotel and drags the Pink Angels--now in full drag--to a party. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it came as a surprise to me. Some of the biggest laughs come from the reactions of the extras, such as the shoe store scene.

You can find this on the 10-movie set ""Drive-In Cult Classics"" for around five bucks, and it's worth it for ""The Pink Angels"" alone! The picture quality is great, especially for such an obscure film.",1307664000,2,1752,4.709150326797386
8153980,3,B000K2Q78C,"This movie comes included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Cinema-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B00310PSUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Cinema: 12 Movie Collection</a>, which is where I watched it.  I can't comment on the quality of the product on this particular page, or quality of the disc - only the entertainment value of the film.

I wasn't even going to review this film, until I noticed that the star average was five.  Consider this a public service announcement.

'Pink Angels' is about six gay bikers traveling down the coast of California to reach a 'cotillion' in San Diego.  Along the way, they meet up with phobic police, truck stop ladies of easy virtue, a straight biker gang, and a self-styled general in what sounds like the John Birch Society.  Considering this was made in 1971, it isn't very surprising that every cliche and stereotype concerning gays are included in this film, though in general, the main characters are portrayed sympathetically.  The primary exception being the ending, which, if you haven't ever seen the film, will come out of nowhere.  I absolutely guarantee that no one would predict it.

IMDB hints that the ending was simply tacked on, which seems credible, given its bizarre nature, but disregarding that, the rest of the film seems pretty inoffensive, to either gay or straight.  Neither offensive, nor uncomfortable, and there are a few genuinely humorous moments in the film - though not really enough to recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a vested interest in the subject matter.  This is a low-budget B-movie, which depends on the interaction of the men with society around them in order to work as a comedy - I will say that while the people in the film's setting are probably more tolerant now than what is portrayed in this film, there are definitely sections of the country where these men would recieve the same (or worse) treatment today.

But the principal players handle their acting chores well enough(including an early turn by Dan Haggerty as one of the straight bikers), and I did chuckle a few times throughout.  All together, it's nothing to write home about, but technically it's one of the better produced films in the collection.  To those who might consider purchasing this film, I'd urge them to look into the 'Savage Cinema' box set rather than purchasing individually, as the picture quality and sound are completely servicable for the film, and the whole collection can be had for around five clams at your local big box store.",1286150400,6,2562,5.171912832929782
