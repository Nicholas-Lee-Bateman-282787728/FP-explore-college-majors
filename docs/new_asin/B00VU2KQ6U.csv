I had hoped to get nutritional information such as fat to  protein ratios  and how that will affect performance and weight. (Not even a mention!)  exercise in the field, hydration. No mention!
This DVD runs much less than 30  minutes and  probably took the same amount of total time to shoot. A semi trained old dog with a man tossing a bumper 20 yards at the park does not  make a conditioning for the field video.
I'll save you a few bucks.  This is a synopsis of the video.
 Dogs belly should be trim.
 You should be able to see the last few ribs on your dog.
 Let your dog run.
 Your dog may even pull a chain for resistance.
 Feed him once a day in the evening.
That's it!!! WOW",1436745600,,852,4.103658536585366
