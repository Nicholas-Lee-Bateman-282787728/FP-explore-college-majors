8004285,4,B0000X02PK,"This is one of two currently available DVDs which cover the 1999 relocation of the Cape Hatteras (NC) lighthouse. The other, ""Move of the Century"", ASIN B0002RQOUG, although very professionally produced, is a DVD-R rather than a commercially pressed DVD, a fact that may pose viewing problems for some older DVD players.

This DVD tends to provide a broad overview of the whole project. Much footage is given to the alternative plans that were proposed and residents' objections to the relocation before the move actually occurred. Nonetheless, the move itself is thoroughly covered in a way that would be of interest to everyone, not just a lighthouse devotee.

The video and audio quality is very good and the documentary's narration (by Stockard Channing) is informative and interesting. An added bonus is the opening and closing comments by the inimitable Walter Cronkite, a sailor of the waters off Hatteras for many years.",1096502400,13,928,5.139072847682119
8004286,5,B0000X02PK,"Even with all the technological advances we have at our disposal these days, I honestly didn't think something this tall and old could be moved so far and so successfully. This is truly a magnificent engineering  achievement. This video also does a great job of  displaying both sides of  the argument of whether or not the Lighthouse should be moved. It was very  interesting to see the changes in the attitudes and opinions of the  ""Locals"" after the move was successfully completed. All in all,  this is a ""must have"" (I really do hate that term, but it fits)  for History Buffs!",963532800,4,582,4.647058823529412
