To the total shame of the reviewer who bashed the DVD without having seen the film, let me simply say that the material in the film is the stuff of which law suits and films like Erin Brockovich are made.

On the one side, we have official denial and cover up.  On the other side, we have a global problem stemming from nuclear proliferation.  Not mentioned in the DVD are the countless nuclear tests performed by numerous countries.  However, what is mentioned is what scientists, such as Oppenheimer, knew about radioactivity at the time of the development of nuclear bombs.  Moreover, we can be sure they did know because there were decades between Marie Curie and the atomic bombs.

So, we have Trinity, two bombs dropped on Japan, nuclear testing, nuclear power plants, three nuclear power plant crises (and maybe two more that are not officially recognized), depleted uranium, and now nuclear waste that has been approved for use in hip replacements, belt buckles, zippers, and so on.  To live in denial is to not just to bury one's head in the sand but to fail to connect the dots.

The film may be biased in favor of those who want to put an end to nuclear power, but the film has merits.  First of all, Dr. Shuntaro Hida is magnificent.  He has devoted nearly six decades to the radiation issue and is as alert and endearing as any person could be.  Secondly, the children of Iraq are charming.  If apologists feel the film went too far in suggesting that radiation is dangerous, I challenge people to look at the much more horrific images of birth defects in Iraq and Afghanistan and ask ourselves as citizens of this Planet if there is anything at all justifying the suffering of these children and those who love them.

Five stars!",1360022400,2,1918,4.622418879056047
8056478,5,B00091SR28,"""Radiation: A Slow Death, A new Generation of Hibakusha""

An extraordinary timely documentary produced by a team of independent Japanese Filmmakers during the  interval between the two Gulf Wars, released 2003, 91 minutes

 Originally, the Japanese word ""hibakusha"" was used to refer to the survivors of the atomic bomb.  Here, the filmmakers go back to its literal meaning  ""victims of radiation"" to include new generations of survivors who have emerged globally.  The film begins with stories of severely ill Iraq children  irradiated by the use of depleted uranium during the first Gulf War  .

Then the filmmakers--along with a Hiroshima survivor-- visit American farmers living near the Hanford plutonium factory in Washington State.  There, an extraordinary bond is formed with some of the ""Downwinders"" whose family members suffered and died from cancer, or gave birth to children with birth defects.  Both Japanese and Americans react to lies and denials from their own governments about the long term effects of radiation.  The final part of the film shows strong statistical correlation between releases of radiation described officially as ""insignificant""  with a pattern of rising cancer rates  and birth defects extending ten years and more.",1302998400,5,1254,5.424870466321243
8056479,1,B00091SR28,"I have not seen this DVD and there may be some truthful information in it. However, I noted some misinformation in the description of it. It alleges that Iraqi children have been exposed to radiation from depleted uranium. There is no proof for such an assertion and in fact the fear of radiation from various sources is much greater in many cases than the actual danger. For example, it has been estimated that there were more than 100,000 abortions in Europe due to fear of Chernobyl radiation. Best estimated from reliable scientific sources as that those were needless abortions and that the dose from Chernobyl was not sufficient to cause birth defects. So it is clear that there were approximately 100,000 needless deaths due to unjustified fear. By the way, I make my living in the field of radiation safety.",1135209600,3,815,4.828571428571428
