8285684,5,B000EU1Q04,"This film captivated me from beginning to end. Every once in a while you see a film that really capture the essence of human nature, and I believe Soulmates has achieved that. I had a spiritual awakening during the wedding scene, it was too beautiful for words. From amazing acting and a groovy soundtrack to the fine details of great hairstyling, you will not regret this purchase! The only question that remains after the end credits rolled was: Who are the two people on the front of the DVD case?",1410566400,,500,4.566666666666666
8285685,1,B000EU1Q04,This is not what I expected in a dvd it feels like a bootleg play. I thought it was an actual movie. I was so disappointed with the dvd I just threw it in the trash.,1260057600,,165,3.611111111111111
8285686,5,B000EU1Q04,"""SoulMates"" is a wonderful, funny,romantic comedy about a dating service. I loved all the stereotypical characters, from the hillbilly to the ""no sex"" client to the movie star to the ""ghetto girl"" to the arrogant boss. I loved the classic antagonisms; it was a totally ""feel good"" movie in that those from the wrong side of the tracks triumphed. The beautiful wedding scene gives us all hope for the power of love.",1208390400,,414,4.763888888888889
8285687,1,B000EU1Q04,I am very surprised that Amazon would sell a DVD that is basically a home movie.  Very low production value.  It was so bad that I could not watch the whole thing. I order a lot from Amazon. This is the only thing that I have ever purchased that I found to be totally unsatisfactory.,1197072000,,283,4.127272727272727
