443493,2,630223722X,"I can only comment on the Lean Body tape, as I received this tape without the stretch routine.  Although the workout itself is made up of good, traditional strength/toning exercises using dumbells and a bench, there were several things I disliked about this video. First of all, prior to each exercise, there is a separate segment in which the move is explained in detail.  Although this would be helpful to someone who is just beginning to work with weights, I think those who have any familiarity with weight training would find these segments to be cumbersome and distracting.  My second problem is with the instructors.  Gay herself is okay, although during much of the video, she has a fake-looking smile plastered on her face--I just did not find her to be genuine or motivating.  Working out with Gay is another woman and a muscle-bound guy.  From watching the video, you would think that the guy is in charge, not Gay, as she frequently asks him how to do things (eg, ""How are we breathing here?"").  In addition, he makes comments to Gay that I found to be condescending and annoying; their interactions seemed very sexist to me.  In summary, this is a solid strength workout, but I just couldn't get past its flaws.",1016755200,4,1224,4.713615023474178

Stretch is a movie that would be ruined by giving away much of the plot.  Basically Patrick Wilson's life isn't going great, his girlfriend dumped him a while back, he's on his last legs at staying employed for the limo company he works for, he's being haunted while driving by an ex driver, and he owes $6000 to the mob who bought his gambling debt.

Here we have a story of a.k.a Stretch, an unaccomplished actor, (underrated Patrick Wilson) who is a limo driver with a broken heart and serious gambling addiction.  Stretch has a problem...a life-threatening problem...if he does not pay back $6,000 by midnight he will have to deal with Mexican mafia.  The film takes plays during one crazy day and night during which Stretch while trying to gather the money runs into all kinds of crazy characters and gets himself into lots of funny and dangerous situations...Wilson is accompanied by other stars, such as: Ed Helms and Jessica Alba, and the film features cameo appearances from David Hasselhoff and Ray Liotta.

443593,3,630223722X,"'Kevin Stretch' (Patrick Wilson) works as a 'Limo-Driver' in L.A, in truth he's a pretty messed-up character, he's lost the
love of his life who's taken up with a Sport-Star, his bank balance is zilch, he's had a gambling problem and still owes
a local gangster $6000, the gangster has changed the terms of the agreement and wants his money by 1.00 a.m or else
basically...'Stretch' is at an all-time-low.
Whilst out on a job he picks up an eccentric billionaire 'Roger Karos' (Chris Pine) (strangely uncredited) who offers to pay
'Stretch' the money he owes if he commits to doing his bidding over the next few hours which includes picking up a brief
case in exchange for some 'accounts-records' which he hasn't been given by 'Roger' for the exchange.
To get himself out of dept will lead to a roller-coaster of a night during which he'll only survive by creative quick-thinking.
There are frequent sequences that will surely bring a smile to your face.
There are also one ore two 'Hollywood-Stars' included taking brief cameo roles such as - 'The Hoff' and 'Ray Loitta' as themselves.
'Jessica Alba' plays 'Charlie' who's on the 'switch' for the 'Limo' company,
A little weird in truth, perhaps one to catch on a TV-Movie-Channel at some point rather than buy.

443596,3,630223722X,"Another epic fail: Patrick Wilson plays Stretch, one of thousands who come to Hollywood with dreams of becoming an actor only to be turned down audition after audition and finally ending up as a limo driver with tastes that exceed his budget.  Those tastes used to include booze and drugs (after his girlfriend left him for a pro football player) but he managed to sober up and get a full-time job.  Unfortunately his wild days have left him one little hangover: some unpaid gambling debt of $6000.00.  To his credit it used to be 12 and he paid off half with weekly installments.  Unfortunately it seems the illegal gambling world is prone to mergers, sellouts and hostile takeovers just like the rest of the corporate world, and the new owners want the remaining $6,000.00 by midnight.  How is a limo driver to come up with 6000.00 in one day?  A potential miracle seems to appear in the form of a rich but crazy billionaire, known to extravagantly tip people like limo drivers

Wilson gives perhaps the most credible performance of this ensemble, as a guy still willing to risk everything on one throw of cosmic dice: a $6,000.00 tip or death (or worse?)  The risks of course grow exponentially worse as his day grinds on.  Kudos also to Chris Pine for his completely bizarre billionaire character (with one of the funniest entrances youve ever seen in a movie) named Karos.  Also I guess thats Jessica Alba playing the limo dispatcher, who has short scenes, but good patter with Wilson.

Ultimately I have to think this is one gigantic parody or at least caricature of Hollywood culture, in which everyone is obsessed with material success (preferably of the fast kind), nobody is exactly who they portray themselves to be, and you should run as fast as you can the other way if they say, trust me.

About two thirds of the way through, as the plot grew more and more strained, I sort of lost interest in following it.  Subtitling would have helped, but because this became an orphan movie, they aren't included.  If you like zany parodies, you may like it.  I can see it being a cult classic for a small fan base.

443652,4,630223722X,"As a director, Joe Carnahan is a bit infuriating.  He's given us SMOKIN' ACES, which is pure unadulterated fun; THE GREY, which is one of the best existential action films I've ever seen; and THE A-TEAM, which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (I'd say I'd want my money back for seeing it, but someone else paid, so I'd just prefer the time.)  STRETCH leans more towards SMOKIN' ACES, with a bit of...well, everything else thrown in.  It starts off incredibly cheesy and slow; but get past the first ten minutes, when the film's vibe truly settles in, and it's a rocket from there until the finish line.

The story revolves around a limo driver (Patrick Wilson), who's adopted the codename ""Stretch"" formerly used by his suicidal predecessor.  In an effort to sabotage a competing limo firm, Stretch sneaks in and snatches Karos (Chris Pine), an eccentric businessman who may be running from something.  Chaos ensues, and through the course of the night, Stretch will learn--and earn--his place on the pecking order.

The acting here is exactly what it needs to be: over-the-top and anarchic.  Pine (in a rather extended cameo role) and Wilson excel; so do James Badge Dale, Ed Helms as the ghostly former Stretch (""What's the plan, Stretch? Successfully outrunning black men on flat surfaces?""), and a slough of cameos (Ray Liotta and The Hoff highlight the list).  The writing is surprisingly solid; I mean, there's no gold here, but the jokes are great, the action is steady, and the ending actually leaves you feeling satisfied (if not surprised).  Carnahan's direction is solid; he never lets things get out of hand, though his juggling does become precarious.  Ultimately, though, STRETCH is a delightfully dark action/comedy, like a typical action movie laced with LSD.  Guy Ritchie by way of Stanley Kubrick, if you can dig it.

This is criminal, as it is incredibly entertaining, and destined for cult status. I won't give away too much, but I will say that it is a sort of crazy mix of Office Space, Fight Club, Collateral, and a Guy Richie flick. For the most part, Patrick Wilson is fantastic. My only issue is that sometimes the movie can't quite nail its tone down...it's mostly a dark action comedy, but on occasion the acting gets a little too lighthearted. Regardless, it's a lot of fun, and Chris Pine has has an unforgettably insane part in the film (with an equally insane entrance) that I won't spoil.

443795,4,630223722X,"The history of film is peppered with flicks like this that are so over the top it excites our amazement. Given this cast and the quality of it I'm surprised I just can't remember its release. Be that as it may, I'm glad I caught up with it.

Here's the scoop. Stretch (Patrick Wilson) is not doing well. His acting career won't take off. His girl just dumped him. The clock on his gambling debt is up and he hates his limo driver job. He gets a fare of an eccentric millionaire (Chris Pine) who might just turn things around for him. But this fare sends him into the wildest ride of his life.

The subtext of this flick is fate vs. free will. Odd stuff happens but is it fate or just odd timing? Just as really bad stuff is going to happen something nudges its way in to alter the situation. Sometimes it's from the outside and sometimes it's from Wilson himself. Either way some way over the top situations ensue.

I've seen some of director Joe Cranahan's other outings. I liked ""Narc"" a lot. I liked ""Smokin' Aces"" well enough. This is closer to ""Smokin' Aces"" in format but played a bit lighter. I liked all the weird stuff happening and Carnahan manages to balance much of it out. There is SO much going though on that he realizes he can't close all the holes in the end so he lets the viewer know that this is by no means over. Wilson plays his role with the right amount of fun and seriousness. I like Pine and he gets a few good scenes. Jessica Alba is Okay but I could have used a bit more of her. There are a couple of good cameos by Ray Liotta and David Haselhoff which add to the loopiness of everything. All the production values are on par with the project and the soundtrack is decent.

This is a lot of fun. It moves at a brisk pace and won't have you looking at your watch. It won't change your life but it's dialed up for beer and pizza so you need to take it as it comes. If you're looking for a romping good time this should do you good.",1415836800,2,1957,4.1421052631578945

443835,3,630223722X,"I'm not sure why everyone is throwing around the words: Cult Classic.  *spoiler alert*

The story was entertaining, especially Chris Pine's character (eccentric and random come to mind).  I did enjoy the character development and I was cheering for the protagonist (Patrick Wilson) throughout the entire story.  In the beginning, the main character questioned the saying: ""everything happens for a reason"", and it somehow comes full circle at the end of the film.  However, a few scripting goofs mixed in with an unrealistic plot pained me as a viewer.  Take for example the scene whereupon the thugs steal Wilson's limo.  Didn't Wilson get fooled into opening the trunk with the car key, and yet the thugs somehow stole the car?  Using what key? Also at the very end:  Patrick Wilson threw the case full of cash into the air and as cliche as this sounds the money case opens up midway through the air causing a rainstorm of bills - wouldn't the police of apprehended him or shot at him during that risky maneuver?  Bow-tie and Ribbon endings aren't exactly cult classics, they're cliche classics, however it was refreshing in that it came full circle without any ambiguities...

Overall it had laugh-out-loud moments, especially with the quick cameos by Ed Helms.  The story line moved quickly and loudly, especially with the out-of-left-field Chris Pine character.  As I mentioned before, the story came full circle and everything happened for a reason.

444009,5,630223722X,"Joe Carnahan has always been one of my favorite directors. The man has a gift for making films that have a true masculine core without resorting to bravado or pomposity that dominates most reality tv. The Grey is a perfect example of this. Neeson in that film sheds his Taken persona to become a true man, a true leader, and real person.

Stretch is his latest offering, and one that proves not all ""Straight to Video"" films are crap. From my understanding, Stretch was made for Universal for 5 million, but the studio didn't want to spend the money marketing this film. Allegedly, they didn't know how to market it. We live in a time when only mega blockbusters get funding, and that's if they're based on pre-existing properties with franchise potential. That's why Mad Men and Justified and Breaking Bad are on TV and not movie. There is no place for them.

Which brings us to Stretch, a film that I can see being tricky to market, but not at all an impossible task. And certainly one I wish had gotten a shot in theaters. It likely wouldn't top the box office, but it'd be nice to see it get a shot with proper marketing. This film I'm sure with half a chance could have easily made back it's meager budget.

But such is the life these days. Good news is, this is an original, fun, thrilling movie with a surprisingly level of charm and even a hint of sweetness.

Stretch is a limo driver on the wrong side of 35 with nothing to show for it. His ambition is misunderstood or wasted, and now his gambling debts are about to catch up to him in a big way. Fortunately, the limo driving business is, apparently, one rife for drama, full of competition, and his latest client is a hyper eccentric billionaire with a knack for heavy tips-the kind that could easily end gambling debts.

Patrick Wilson plays Stretch, and his story is mostly narrated by Wilson. Rarely does a voiceover actually have fun, but Wilson gets to do so. But the real fun is had by just about everybody else in the movie.

David Hasslehoff has one short but very memorable scene. Ray Liotta gets another equally outlandish cameo. James Badge Dale is also very good, but I can't say much of his character.

And then Chris Pine. Holy hell does he have fun with his character, chewing the scenery and demanding attention with every single frame. An absolute bat-guano insane, fun to watch performance. Carnahan seems to be the only director to let Pine play something other than generic white action lead male.

At this point I don't want divulge any more plot details. But the movie is fast paced, well written, well executed, and Wilson is fun to watch. There are couple of great bits too that just nail Hollywood ego and sensibilities. A scene with a bouncer at a nightclub is a good example. It feels like Michael Mann and Guy Ritchie made a crime movie set in LA. It's fresh, fun, and absolutely worth checking out, especially if you liked Smokin' Aces.

And once again, props to Chris Pine in this flick. You'll never see Captain Kirk quite like this. Unless he got off a 5 month drug fueled sex bender on some crazy planet with horny green women.",1412726400,20,3122,4.511504424778761

However, weeding through the list of what she has to offer is definitely worth it. I like the Lean Body routine well. The pace is slow enough to really heavy up. If you do, you are glad that each section has a 20 second introduction to catch your breath or have some water. She may do multiple exercises for the same muscle group, but she does not repeat sets. I modified some of it to work upper and lower body together to get more done. This workout was a little like Kathy Smith's Upper and Lower Body Workout or like some older-style Cathe Friedrich weight workouts. The routine is very basic yet up-beat and friendly and based on how much weight is used, quite strenuous.",1251417600,,819,4.394736842105263
444012,4,630223722X,"Gay Gasper leads you through a strength training routine that hits the major muscle groups in under an hour.  Gay is joined by Linda who shows beginner level and Scott who shows advanced level, while Gay shows intermediate level.  You will need weights and they use a weight bench for some of the chest and back exercises, but those could easily be done on the floor.  Some of the other exercises are seated as well, but could be done standing up.  A step is also used but for the warmup only. Before each exercise is performed there is a brief demostration of the exercise, which is also used for a rest period.  The setting is the same as Gay's The Next Step workout, the music a cross between rock and hip/hop dancy music.

After the warmup you will start with lower body exercises, 15 reps are done for each exercise, starting with squats, then static lunges, wide squats (plies), another set of static lunges, then calf raises.  All the exercises are done in a 2-2 count.

Upper body is next, here twelve reps are done for each exercise.  Back is first with lat pullovers and one arm rows, then you will move into chest with incline flies and bench presses.  Then you will do overhead presses and side lateral raises for shoulders, kickbacks and lying extensions for triceps.  The tricep exercises are performed one arm at a time, for extra challenge you could do both arms for each, I sometimes do this for a little extra work.  Biceps are next with traditional curls and alternating hammer curls before finishing out with wrist curls for forearms.

A brief ab session follows, you will do a short set of traditional crunches, and oblique twists.  Then you will stretch out.

Overall, I liked this workout, although there were some minor annoyances.  Gay is the leader of this workout but sometimes seems like Scott is the leader instead as he chimes in a lot with his input and pointers.  He is also the voiceover for the demonstrations.  I personally would have preferred Gay do the talking, but I am usually able to tune this out.

The other video is a 20 plus minute stretch routine, it is mainly athletic style stretching.  Here is Gay joined by 2 females, they are dressed in blacy lacy attire.  The setting is quite dark with soft music playing in the background.  Based of one viewing it is nothing spectacular but complete.

All in all, not a bad deal for the price.  I like Gay as an instructor and wished that she had more videos available.",1124582400,,2457,4.5697940503432495

I was happy to have found it.",1524873600,,100,4.05
7823087,4,630223722X,"Very funny dialogue and a host of great actors make Stretch a fun limo ride.  I wasn't familiar with Joe Carnahan (Screenplay) nor with the writing team of Jerry Corley, Rob Rose, and Joe Carnahan (Story), but they have created a real treat in Stretch.  The dialogue is irreverent, often hilarious, although it can and does get raunchy at times, the movie is damn funny while still having a warmth.  It's a fun movie.  I really liked it.",1523664000,,437,4.564102564102564
7823088,1,630223722X,Seriously..the quality of this movie is just junk! It looks like it was filmed in the 90's! I can't say anything good about this movie....couldn't get into the story because of the cheap feel and look of this one. I really wanted to like it.,1523404800,,241,4.377777777777778

7823090,5,630223722X,Another very good film by Joe Carnahan. The cast is terrific. Patrick Wilson and Chris Pine are hilarious.,1509494400,,106,4.944444444444445
7823091,3,630223722X,It's inconceivable that a 2014 film would be released on DVD without subtitles or Closed-Captions.,1490486400,,98,5.6

7823094,1,630223722X,"This movie sucked. There were some ok parts, laughed a few times, but mainly just sat through it waiting for something extraordinary to happen and it didnt. End of the movie could be seen a mile away.",1486339200,,200,4.4324324324324325
7823095,5,630223722X,"This might be my favorite role to date that Chris Pine has played and I am a huge fan of the new Trek movies. His chaotic ""firestarter"" Karos absolutely steals the spotlight while on screen. Don't get me wrong Patrick Wilson's nonchalant way of handling genuinely ridiculous situations is hilarious. Ed Helms only adds to the hilarity with his off beat awkwardness. The characters and sheer awkwardness of each one is what sells this movie. A crude, profanity and sex laden experience not to be missed by those with a gritty sense of humor.",1478736000,,540,4.75531914893617
