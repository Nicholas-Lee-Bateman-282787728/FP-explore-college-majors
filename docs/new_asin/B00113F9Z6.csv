8304324,4,B00113F9Z6,"The Feels Like Flying series is geared toward making you feel like you're in the cockpit of a small plane at low level.  The experience is enhanced by soothing background music.  The cameras were actually mounted on the wing strut of a Piper Cub aircraft so there is no instrument panel, propeller or anything else to obstruct the forward view.  Pilots and wannabe pilots typically love these videos, especially those who prefer low and slow flying to high and fast flying.  You can usually tell the pilots in the room when watching the video.  They're the ones who lean right when the screen tilts right, and left when the screen tilts left.  I am one of those pilots who prefers low and slow, mainly because I like to enjoy the scenery, and that leads to the only real drawback I see to the way these videos were shot.  Most of the clips are taken at such low altitude that I feel they sometimes miss out on the opportunity to catch even more beautiful scenery.  Of course, being closer to the ground enhances the perception of speed, and I know that will also appeal to some viewers.  It's just not my personal preference.  The Great Outdoors is my favorite of all three videos because it offers the best scenery, other than what I consider a short boring clip over the salt flats in Utah, and the music is much better than in the other videos.  I even ordered a copy of the soundtrack.

I'm leaving the first feedback on this particular DVD, but I'll make a few comments based on feedback left by others on the other two DVDs in this series.  These videos were made before high definition became a hot item.  Do not expect good picture quality on a big screen because you won't get it.  These videos do not give a scenic tour of the US.  They only present clips of a very few specific spots, some of them in Canada.",1273622400,,1819,4.4174174174174174
