7466066,5,B016AGEM2E,My son just loves this show. It also reminds me of when I watches the older version as a kid.,1465430400,,93,3.7

7466068,4,B016AGEM2E,"Its actually five stars for the series itself; Ive been an Alvin & the Chipmunks fan since 1984, and this series is best thing theyve done in 25 years...the best since the 80s series, maybe even a little better.

Unfortunately, there are only 9 (individual 10-minute) episodes included on this volume (one disc). They are also in no particular order, based on air dates or pairs of episodes as shown on TV, at least in the US. I have not seen this collection (or Vol. 2) in stores (as opposed to the 7-episode disc) and with no info online, I had no idea how many or which episodes were included before purchasing it. Episodes are:

-Talking Teddy
-A is for Alien
-Albrittina
-Good Luck, Mr. Whiskers
-What a Gem
-Kickin It Old School (similar to the 1983 episode Swiss Family Chipmunks)
-Mystic Mountain
-Turf War
-Simon For President

Episodes are in both English and French (Ive never heard the Chipmunk in French until now!), which may contribute to there being so few episodes on the disc (which is NTSC, Zones 1-6). Dave sounds different in French of course, but the Chipmunks and Chipettes sound perfect!

Also includes a full-color booklet with character profiles (partly taken from the official Alvin & the Chipmunks site throughout the past several years), episode summaries, and activities in both English and French.

I know someone commented about an issue with the colors on Volume 2, and I don't have that one yet because I wanted to get Vol. 1 first, but the colors in these episodes on this disc and bright and vibrant and look just as they do on TV.

Hope to see more volumes on DVD until my collection is complete! Can anyone tell me what episodes are on Volume 2 of Season 1?",1456790400,11,1695,4.614617940199335
8736083,3,B016AGEM2E,"Watched the '80s series as a kid via youtube prior to liscencing changes in '08 or '09. This reboot is excellent, with some of Britanny's original character back. Some subtle character changes compared to the CG films make me elated. My only disappontment is that Ms. Miller's character has been reduced to nothing. Sure, her original character was not very kid-friendly, but was moreso than Brittany's. If Brittany's original character can be added though censors, why not Ms. Miller's?
I will admit that while the animation makes most of the characters look good, Dave is not one of them. For the Chipminks and Chipettes, the animation combines features from the CG fims and the '80s series. And it is nice to see the sizing obstacles they face. Their height is uncertain. I have really good visual-spacial skills, and analyzed a frame from ""Principal Interest"" with Brittany next to a fourth-generation desktop Mac, which is about 2 feet tall. However, in a later episode, when Alvin says he has ""friends in high places"", Simon replies saracstically that his brother is only twelve inches (one foot) tall. The heights are not comparable to either the '80s cartoon or the CG film for their counterparts. It shows the Chipettes being shorter than the Chipmunks despite the fact that they are in middle school (girls are generally taller than boys in middle school, but I estimate them to be in 8th grade due to the male peers' expression of sexual attraction). In fact, Theodore is shown being as tall as Brittany (accounting for subtle sneaker height).
One con is that a whole pop song is played instead of part, which kind of stalls the diologue. Each episode is 11 minutes, so playing a 3-minute pop song would reduce dialogue to 8 minutes. The producers actually write the songs, making them better than regular pop and suitable for inclusion (most pop songs nowadays are about sex, and pretty obvious about it too). The sibling rivalry between Alvin and Simon is still there, as well as the former's love/hate relationship with Brittany, so it is very well done. However, I would like to see Brittany's worse from the '80s, even as an off mood. My only regerets were not seeing the box set before buying this and lacking season two availability.",1530057600,,2251,4.849350649350649

8736086,4,B016AGEM2E,Was hoping this product would be in a traditional dvd case. It was not and was actually a really thin cardboard like thing. That makes them even more easily damaged. But I suppose if you don't care about the case that hold your dvds then everything is great and I recommend this set. Its not the classic alvin and chipmunks I grew up with but at least when they brought this show back its good some other shows and cartoons I cant say same for.,1512000000,,444,4.235294117647059
8736087,5,B016AGEM2E,Love these episodes and was thrilled to find them available on DVD since they were quickly removed from iTunes. Hopefully additional seasons will become available in the future. I'm attaching an image that provides the back of the DVD case to help others see what episodes are included since there wasn't one included (at least at the time I purchased). Hope that helps.,1504051200,2,370,4.888888888888889
8736088,3,B016AGEM2E,"When my daughter was born, ALVINNN was one of those shows she just loved to watch all the time.... now they are not on HULU anymore, I had to search for the DVDs and found them on here. I bought every season/volume! I was so excited... Only to be extremely disappointed and PEEVED that there are no Caption options on these. I mean, REALLY? That's not really happening anymore these days. it's 2017. I'm deaf and it's important for me to be able to watch these shows with my daughter.  I'm happy for her to have these DVDs at least but, ugh... come on, get with the times.. add the caption for the deaf and hard of hearing audiences options please!!!",1501200000,,650,4.371900826446281
