2680879,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I bought this DVD a month ago and I LOVE it. This is the fastest way to help lose weight I have ever tried. The workout starts with a short warm-up, then into a moderate cardio, and boom! A high-intensity turbo. Studies have shown that switching from high-intensity to a lower intensity throughout the workout gets much faster results. Well this is proof! I would have paid twice as much for this DVD and still thought of it as a bargain. The other DVD's she has are great too, but this one is my favorite because it gives FAST results! I lost 20 pounds last month from diet and this workout. Worth every penny!",1183766400,87,611,4.368421052631579
2680880,5,B000JZ2VB2,I bought all of the DVDs. If you do them religiously you will notice a difference. I actually recommended these to two of my friends who also jump started their weightloss with this workout. It is high energy but so much fun. It truly doesnt feel like a workout.,1389744000,,262,4.36734693877551
2680881,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I love that this is a short, but fun and effective workout. This is how I fell ""in love"" with Chalene! You'll love her - such an inspiration.",1388361600,,141,4.071428571428571
2680882,4,B000JZ2VB2,"I have been doing cardio party 1 for several months and although is a great work out I got the plateau phase on my weight. I bought fat blaster to break the routine. It is really good. I like it and I feel it is really easy compared with the cardio.  sometimes I like to repeat one or two turbos. I haven't noticed any difference on my weight yet but I just started 2 weeks ago.
It is good when I don't feel like doing any exercise and really time flies doing this. Hope to lose manyyyy pounds!",1387065600,,494,4.040816326530612
2680883,5,B000JZ2VB2,Chalene's dvds keep me motivated and fit and I highly recommend them.  This one was no exception..I have a few so that I don't get bored.,1385769600,,137,4.269230769230769
2680884,1,B000JZ2VB2,"Did not like this DVD at all. I paid $20 ad it is worth less than $5. Music is not clear, sound of horn in the background is annoying and there is too many stops between routines that does not help get a good exercise. I have many aerobic and kick boxing DVDs, I like many of them but this does not meet my expectation. Even the picture on the cover of the DVD shows Chery has a punching gloves on, but when you play the DVD she does not. I puchased the punching gloces but I cannot use it with this DVD. This is one of very few DVDs I did not like.",1382140800,,549,3.824561403508772
2680885,5,B000JZ2VB2,I would recommend this video to any one who loves turbo jam. this workout is tons of fun and goes by very quickly. it's a half hour long and you go through 4 turbos. you first learn it at low intensity and then you do it again at high intensity with a small break in between. I thought it would be hard but it's actually a lot of fun!,1381708800,,334,3.8550724637681157
2680886,1,B000JZ2VB2,"I love Turbo Jam but I HATED this one.  I agree with all the other one stars that this is silly, complicated and ineffective. I was hoping for a harder version of Cardio Party One with more turbos and I got this silly dance video that was poorly constructed and the slow part too slow and fast part too fast.  Any benefit I got from the turbo was ruined by the extreme drop in level on the slow part.  I was actually thinking about buying Turbo Fire but this turned me off so bad I decided not to purchase her new series.",1379635200,,521,4.088235294117647
2680887,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I really like this DVD because it gives you a chance to learn the turbos at low impact before you do them again at high impact. In this DVD, there is a warm-up, 4 turbos (each one at low impact, then high impact), cardio cool down that is really just all the punches again very similar to the warm-up, and a stretch. These are not 4 new turbos - there are definitely some from other TJ DVDs here. (However, the 1st turbo is one of my favorites, so I don't mind) The workout is only 30 minutes, so it's great to do alone or as an add-on to another DVD (TJ 3T is also only 30 min, so they are great to do back to back, but there's also Ab Jam and the 20 Min workout to mix and match). I like to use this one as a warm-up to The Firm Express, since they are only 20 minutes. Then I do a segment from Suzanne Bowen's Gorgeous Core to cool down, and finish with stretches again. This is probably not the best DVD to try if you're just starting out with TJ, but if you like Chalene and have been doing Turbo Jam for a little while, this is definitely a fun one to add you your collection.",1378252800,3,1082,3.9452054794520546
2680888,3,B000JZ2VB2,"There are 4 turbos! I got sweaty...it is a workout. I have a big complaint about the siren noise in the first part. It's part of the song, but reminds me of Star Trek's warning siren! I was thankful when it ended. The other complaint is the routines aren't fluid enough. Too choppy!

It's okay, I give it 3 stars. Love Turbo Jam series, this one is a semi-dud.",1376352000,,360,4.217391304347826
2680889,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I have many other Turbo Jam DVDs and this is the one I enjoy doing the most. It is roughly 30 minutes but they fly by. If you like Turbo Jam or want to try interval training, I highly recommend Fat Blaster.",1375056000,,206,3.9285714285714284
2680890,5,B000JZ2VB2,I love all of Chalene's workouts and this one is no different. It is quick but effective. It is high intensity cardio in a half an hour.,1374624000,,136,4.074074074074074
2680891,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I love this workout. This workout packs a punch. At the end of the exercise I was dripping sweat. The move are fun and the music is great, I found myself singing along to the lyrics. I would recommend this to anybody.",1371254400,,217,4.190476190476191
2680892,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I can't believe how quickly this workout flies by. It is a series of the Turbo's. Two minutes to learn and then two minutes at the high intensity, it's over before you know it. Love it!",1370736000,,185,4.166666666666667
2680893,3,B000JZ2VB2,"Let me start by saying that I love the Turbo Jam workouts.  I had been doing the original DVD with the 5 Rockin workouts for some time so I decided to purchase the additional 5 workouts (including Fat Blaster).  I had read reviews of how much people loved this workout and I had high hopes as well.  However, I don't like it very much.  Its my least favorite of all of the cardio workouts.  Its basically just turbo drill after turbo drill.  I find myself getting very frustrated by the end.  I guess I would say that if you like the Cardio Party workouts that have lots of the choreographed kicking, punching, dancing, etc., you might want to skip Fat Blaster.  Im sure its a good workout for some, just not for me.",1369958400,,716,4.330827067669173
2680894,5,B000JZ2VB2,This is part of Chalene (not charlene) Johnsons at home dvd series Turbo Jam. Its mainly for beginning /intermediate. Its upbeat and fun. The 30 minutes goes by fast but your going to feel it. If your more of an advanced exerciser you should try her Turbofire series.,1368576000,,267,4.583333333333333
2680895,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This is a great workout.  Its fun, makes you sweat and trims away inches and pounds.  The more I did it the better I got at it.  I highly recommend this workout.",1366156800,3,161,3.96875
2680896,3,B000JZ2VB2,"This workout is fun...but very slow compared to TurboFire.  I will use it if I get pregnant again...or on days when I have time for an extra ""fun"" workout but it's not as intense as I would prefer.  If you are a beginner or do not like working out with a high intensity you will like this video.  If you are advanced, it will be slow for you.",1363910400,2,342,4.0
2680897,5,B000JZ2VB2,Easy to learn and fast when your strapped for time.  I have to workout when my one yr old naps so I don't have a whole lot of time.  Depending on the day.  This workout allows you to burn a crazy amount of calories and have fun doing it in a half hour.  Get ready to sweat.,1361404800,,273,3.736842105263158
2680898,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This workout is incredible! It takes all the fun from the other Turbo Jam workouts... THE TURBOS! I felt a little jibbed because once of the drills are recycled but the other ones are fun. Plus this workout has finally got my jumping. Two girls in the workout do these star jumps that are really fun! If you love Turbo Jam & Chalene(and the turbo jam crew Jenelle, Mindy & Terry are in this one!) then you'll love it. And it challenges you for only 30 minutes. And it really just flys by! One of the these I love about the workouts that is small... the timer. It makes everything easy to push for cause you see the clock and think 'Oh ONLY 2 minutes for me to push for this). And I'm right now 215 lbs woman jumping and full of energy for this workout!",1359763200,2,752,4.157534246575342
2680899,4,B000JZ2VB2,I enjoy it. Just starting to workout again so this is a good starting point. But I know after a while it will still be a good workout.,1358035200,,134,3.8214285714285716
2680900,1,B000JZ2VB2,"Im usually a huge fan of the Instructor and the other Turbo Jam videos. They're usually very detailed, fun & easy to follow. Unfortunately this video did not measure up to the others. The music was awful and at times it didn't seem to flow with the movements. There was little instruction and most of the moves were lacking form and were hard to follow. I found myself bored and watching the clock hoping it would end soon. I would NOT recommend this video although i love the others. Fat Blaster is just not worth the time or money.",1357257600,,533,4.393939393939394
2680901,5,B000JZ2VB2,I have since moved on to turbo fire & yet I still come back for this work out. I've gotten friends to try it & I just love it. It never gets old. At one time I was doing this work out five days a week for three months. It never got easy! I love it & it's my favorite of the turbo jam. When you get in better shape try with leg & arm weights! Kicked my butt & lost 20 lbs.,1356998400,4,371,3.4819277108433737

2680905,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I really enjoy this workout..no dread factor whatsoever. I workout with Cathe, Michelle Dozois, Jari Love, and Kelly Coffey videos so this is not as advanced as I would like but its fun for a quick cardio workout before weights. I am going to try adding the weighted gloves
for a more intense workout.  It  My 7 yr old daughter did it with me and we had so much fun. Chalene is the real deal in making working out fun and effective! I am dripping sweat afterwards so that is a good workout to me!",1349568000,,496,4.2105263157894735
2680906,3,B000JZ2VB2,"I really like Chalene. I own ChaLEAN Extreme and several turbo fire workouts. I am also a Turbo Kick instructor. I had never done Turbo Jam before this workout and I expected high intensity but I was disappointed. The workout is fun and good for beginners and maybe intermediates, but there are much better HIIT workouts than this. I didn't even break a sweat in 30 minutes. I smiled but I need something much more amped up. If you are looking for a easy-to-medium short workout than this is for you but if you want a HIIT workout with real intensity, check out her Turbo Fire HIIT workouts, they are a much better workout.",1345507200,,623,4.473684210526316
2680907,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I really appreciate the energy and enthusiasm of this workout. Chalene brings it as alway, but this on happens to be my favorite. The music is jumping. Perfect workout for those in that plateau stage. Get ready to put in a whole lot of sweat equity. Let's get it!",1343433600,,263,4.387755102040816
2680908,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I am a Turbo Jam fan & this was my first time purchasing this particular workout. Based on all the reviews I read, I was left undecided & I just followed my instinct. I am glad I did becuase I was not disappointed. I am loving this workout & I am enjoying the turbos. I also love that it's short because I don't have much to spare, also gives me no excuse to skip working out. Like any other workout, do your part & you will see results. Chalene Johnson is phenomenal, never knew exercising would be this fun!",1341532800,,509,4.151515151515151
2680909,5,B000JZ2VB2,I love turbo jam! This dvd was brand new shipped fast and is still playin great after a few weeks of daily use :),1341273600,,113,3.75
2680910,5,B000JZ2VB2,This is a GREAT workout! I lost fifteen pounds by using it and alternating with Turbojam's Twenty Minute workout. I plan to lose more and this dvd will absolutely help. It goes by fast and I love the tai chi she does at the end to help you cool down. All in all a GREAT and FAST way to lose pounds and inches! G.J.,1335657600,4,314,3.921875
2680911,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I don't normally leave reviews but I had to after doing this workout.  It is by far my favorite, I have almost all the turbo jam videos and I really love them a lot.  I also have Charlean Extreme which is a favorite of my mine as well.  If you are looking for a fast effective workout this is the one for you.  It is a must have!!!",1334188800,,331,3.823529411764706
2680912,5,B000JZ2VB2,I purchased this in 2008 from Amazon and have to say that if you want to shake some fat off your body this will deftnitely do it.  I used this today again and its funny that I actually feel lighter after getting back to Turbo Jam after Xmas.  It really does the trick and I do recommend it because it goes by so fast and I like the music even though her other workouts have better songs.  Anymore I find ordinary aerobics very boring and they just don't have the fun factor that turbo jam has and that is needed to get through a grueling workout.  buy this because it works and is fun with never a dull moment.  I am in my forties with fibromyalgia and if I can do it so can you by taking it slowly and building up to the full program.  This is what I had to do so you do it to. Okay?,1326326400,3,784,3.89937106918239
2680913,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This is one kick-butt workout.  I really enjoy it. I have seen immediate results with this workout, and it is also very fun to do.  High energy!!  I am thrilled that I bought this.",1325635200,,180,4.235294117647059
2680914,5,B000JZ2VB2,"Great workout DVD with a great price. Chalene & the music is fun & energetic, and keeps you moving. There's a quick warm-up exercise in the beginning, followed by 4 sets of interval workouts. Each interval set lasts a few minutes & consists of a low-intensity version, followed by a high-intensity version. Afterwards, there is a cool-down stretch. Sadly, the ACTUAL workout is short. The WHOLE dvd is 30 minutes long, INCLUDING the warm-up & the cool-down. It would have been even better if there were more sets of interval workouts. But overall a good purchase & I will continue using it!!",1320624000,,591,4.803921568627451
2680915,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I just did this fat blaster, and WOW!!!!
If you're looking for higher intensity and MORE FUN, this TOTALLY beats the cardio party!!!!!!
I was SMILING during this, and I almost wanted to do it again, because it was so fun!",1314403200,,221,4.414634146341464
2680916,4,B000JZ2VB2,"At first I thought this video was ""just ok"" because I didn't like how it went from high-low-high-low intensity. For me, I'd rather have a consistent ""high intensity"". However, after a week I learned to like it. Chalene is energetic as usual and it keeps you going! Love Turbo Jam and I've been shedding ""those last 10  pounds""!",1311465600,,327,4.637931034482759
2680917,1,B000JZ2VB2,"I love turbojam...let's get that clear.

However, this is my least favorite of the DVD's.  I think it is too dancy, a little harder to follow, the music is terrible, and I am distracted by chalene's too short tight shorts that outline body areas that do not need to be!  There are MUCH better Turbo Videos' and the newer Turbofire HIIT videos are way way way better!",1303862400,6,366,4.432835820895522
2680918,4,B000JZ2VB2,"I really enjoy this workout because it's high impact calorie burn in a short amount of time and Chalene's enthusiasm is infectious. I started working out with this Turbo Jam dvd and pairing it with strength training from Biggest Loser's Power Sculpt. And in just two weeks I noticed my waistline getting slimmer. My husband even noticed my waist change! My weight hasn't come down yet but my body feels firmer and shapely. I can't wait to see what happens in about a month or two. Oh yeah I also keep track of my calorie consumption and burn via my Lose It app...it all helps and so far this has been the healthiest way I've treated myself when it comes to losing weight.

2680919,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I have been a fan of the Turbo Jam DVD's for many years.  I stopped doing them for a period and switched to Tracy Anderson's workout as well as Pilates.  I ended up coming back to the Turbo Jam series for the results.  With this workout you can make it as intense or as moderate as you need to so it works for just about anyone.  The music and the clothing are outdated and many people might think we have come a long way and there are much more advanced workouts out on DVD.  That might be true, but this series works for me for several reasons you have 4 different workouts that you can either do alone or combine them throughout your day, for instance do the 20 minute cardio and later on do the 20 minute ab workout, on days you have more time do the 40 minute cardio along with the ab workout.  My favorite is the Turbo Sculpt I do this at least 2 days a week along with running.  With the Turbo routine you control the results by using heavier weights or lighter if necessary.  I like Tracy Anderson's workouts, but I get better results with Turbo Jam.  I think what makes this work is the combination of kick boxing and the high low intensity you really feel like you accomplished something when you are done.  You will sweat and you will get your heart rate up, you will also build muscle if you stick with it.  The main reason I came back to this series is because I turned 50 in December and I started to notice a bit of belly fat and some skin sagging under my arms.  I know if you don't do something right away it will only get worse.  From what people have told me menopause if awful so I have no intention of sitting around letting it get the best of me.  I am 5'7 size 4 and I plan on staying this way as long as possible.  If you don't build muscle you will get fat it only makes sense.  I highly recommend this workout series.",1297987200,,1843,4.106145251396648
2680920,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I have tried many workout dvds and while if you stick to them they provide results, they normally don't hold interest for too long once the routine loses the ""new"" appeal and thus becomes boring. NOT THIS DVD!:) Turbojam fat blaster is amazing! not only does it deliver results three times as fast as other workout dvds but its fun! And it stays fun. Which keeps you motivated. Which leads to continuous fitness. A major positive of this dvd is that you can choose whether to do the workout while listening to the instruction but then once youve gotten better at it you can choose to do it with the music pumped up- which is something that most other workout dvds lack which leads to boredom with the same repetitive instructions each time.",1296864000,,740,4.571428571428571
2680921,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I have this workout on a Chalean Extreme dvd (included with the program), and it is AWESOME cardio! The workout is broken down into 4 Turbos, fun little choreographed routines that aren't hard to follow. You do one Turbo at low intensity and then do the same Turbo at as high an intensity as you can. I used my heart rate monitor with this and burned 159 calories, peaking at 174 bpm with an average hr of 139. The best thing about this workout is that even if I'm dreading it that day, Chalene has me smiling and laughing within 5 minutes, which really helps!",1294185600,,560,4.3428571428571425
2680922,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I am really enjoying this fat blaster workout.  I always find myself running out of time so it under 30mins which leaves no excuses!  The best thing about this is that I am completely engaged and entertained for the entire course of the workout and find that the 30mins fly along.  At first I thought Chalene was going to do my head in because she was so perky but this is not the case at all, if anything she is very likable and motivational and trust me I am a grump first thing in the morning but she does manage to make me smile!  I also like the tai chi bit at the end, a bit of time for you take in your own energy for a min or two.

I have been doing this for a little over two weeks and can see my body looking more toned and defined.  Can't wait to see what the results will be in three months from now.  This is a winner.",1292889600,,831,3.8816568047337277
2680923,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I converted my garage to a home gym and I love to use exercise videos. I bought this Turbojam video, despite my reservations due to its 80s-Califorina style picture on the cover. Although the music and the instructor are a little cheezy,if you allow yourself to get into it (hey, no one is watching, right?) then it is a very effective workout. It contains high-end cardio moves that you can alter if they are too tough. And I agree with other reviewers who say that the 30 minutes goes by quickly. Additionally, the cool down is particularly effective. After this video I feel great- stretched out and like I really did burn some calories. I am going to buy some of the other Turbojam videos and add them to my exercise video library.",1289520000,,735,4.533834586466165
2680924,4,B000JZ2VB2,"I purchased this a while back. I don't think it's too hard. I'm pretty out of shape and I'm able to keep up with it. I think if you've got problems with your shoulders, knees, or ankles though this wouldn't be a good work out. Lately, I've been having some issues with my Achilles Tendons thanks to my job, and it's a little harder for me to do this workout due to all the bouncing around. So, if you have arthritis or something, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't use it as a sole source for working out either. It's a good fat burner (thus the name) but of course strength training and ab work is a good thing to mix in with it. I like to use it three times a week, where as I also jog five times a week. Things are working pretty well. It's not my absolute favorite work out from Chalene, but it's really good. Fun, it goes by fast, you can control the intensity, blah blah. I'm happy with my purchase.",1285027200,2,899,4.084745762711864

2680927,5,B000JZ2VB2,"Fat Blaster is SUPER FUN. It's just the Turbos, so it goes by really fast. You learn one at a low intensity, and then do it with the higher intensity. It really gets your heart rate up, which is something you don't find as much in the Cardio Party workouts.

I work out with a Bodybugg, and my avg calorie burn per minute is about the same as the Cardio Party workouts, but HIIT training is supposed to be really good for burning fat (hence the name). I like to do this along with Ab Jam as part of my TJ rotation (this along with the 3 Cardio Partys).",1282780800,2,552,4.064220183486238
2680928,5,B000JZ2VB2,"As a die-hard devotee to Tae-Bo, I often found myself getting bored of the same routines.  Turbo Jam Fat Blaster has changed my views on workout videos!  This video is the best workout I've ever had, and best of all, it's FUN!!  The high intensity workouts challenge you, and you can feel your body burning those calories!  You will sweat, you will move and groove, and you will want to do it all over again!  I highly recommend this video for anyone looking to spice up their video collection, because this will become your favorite!",1281916800,,534,4.578947368421052
2680929,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I began my foray into Turbo Jam with the first DVDs released (Turbo Jam  Beach Body 5 Rockin' Workouts) and have ordered additional DVDs from the line to keep the variety fresh. Fat Blaster is a 30-minute workout consisting of four sets of turbos that you may have done in other Turbo Jam DVDs (a low intensity ""practice"" followed by a full intensity version). Instructor Chalene Johnson mentions that Fat Blaster is for ""special occasions"" and when you don't have time for a full 40-50 minutes. Side Note: It is best to be accustomed to the Turbo Jam moves (via the 5 Rockin' Workouts) because sometimes the instructor's transitions/cues are lacking. This is not a problem with practice!

I have performed Fat Blaster with and without one-pound weighted hand gloves and found that I can burn up to around 300 calories on average (I use a Polar heart rate monitor). To compare, for the Cardio Party 1 and 3 DVDs I am able to burn approximately 500-700 depending on how ""into"" them I am.

PROS: The intervals - you do low intensity followed by a relatively brief high intensity jump, and back again. Interval training is shown to improve performance and lead to the adaptation response; the body building new capillaries and being better at taking in and delivering O2 to your muscles. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, more cals are burned during short, high intensity exercise compared to long, slow endurance exercise. For more HIIT (high intensity interval training), I'd recommend Turbo Fire - an advanced version of Turbo Jam that incorporates more plyometrics and challenging moves in a series of DVDs (about 11 or 12 in total) done over the course of 20 weeks.

CONS: Fat Blaster isn't necessarily challenging enough for elite athletes. Same can be said about the entire Turbo Jam series, but I must say that you get out of it what you put in. Your intensity = more calories burned and a more effective workout no matter what you're doing. Also, it can be disheartening that you don't pour sweat in the first 10 minutes of Fat Blaster. At least it was for me the first time I did it. But by the time I was cooling down, I noticed that not sweating was no longer a problem!

That being said, I do enjoy Fat Blaster for the variety it offers into my normal Turbo Jam lineup and in ramping up to Turbo Fire.",1281312000,6,2331,4.634382566585956
2680930,5,B000JZ2VB2,"My 18 year old daughter asked me to buy this for her.  I figured it would be one more DVD sitting on a shelf collecting dust.  WRONG!! She is using this DVD everyday and loving it!  She said the workout goes by so fast it's surprising but that is how ""in to it"" you become as you are working out along with it.  She already has noticable improvement.  It's a great workout DVD and I am glad that I bought it for her.",1275436800,,416,3.963855421686747

2680932,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I've tried many at-home workout videos & this one is by far the best!  You will see a MAJOR difference in your body after one month.  Also, the alternating between low & high impact keeps you motivated throughout the entire 30 minutes.",1271203200,,235,4.571428571428571
2680933,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This DVD is amazing!! Absolutely exactly what I was looking/hoping for. I have her other Turbo Jam collection & loved it, but it was time to step it up a notch (and getting bored with the redundancy)!! I read the reviews & decided to give it a try. I am a 40 year old who has always been active & athletic but have had a few set backs with injuries (mostly knees) and have a busy family life so I am limited with workout options. This DVD is just what I needed. Get some weighted gloves also to increase the workout/sweat. WATCH THE YOUTUBE CLIPS THAT ARE POSTED. Thats how I knew for sure that I wanted this DVD. Tried the Wii Fit & it just was too slow moving for me. I do better when the action is faster!! I am still learning some of the moves since I am not the most coordinated individual, but its coming & I like the option of doing lower impact on days when I am sore. Check it out but don't pay $60. Shop around. I think I got it for $30 total from a smaller amazon linked store.",1268179200,,988,4.020304568527918
2680934,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I have been doing turbo jam on and off for three years. It's the only exercise video I actually enjoy and will come back to. This is a 30 minute video that at any intensity level you will be sweating... and burning calories! I use the weighted gloves for extra. There are four turbos done twice. First at a lower intensity to learn and then at high impact to bring your heart rate up.

Perfect workout and energy booster. I have to work hard in order to get results and this video will do it. I highly recommend it!",1267660800,,515,4.202020202020202
2680935,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I am an on and off exerciser...i am 5 feet 1 inch and 114 pounds so I don't  have too much weight too lose. My most difficult areas are my hips and thighs. If you are like me and don't have too much to lose  you know how hard it is to lose those last few pounds. When i got fat blaster and added that in my exercise rotation I lost 6 pounds in a month. My hips and thighs got slimmer and I could fit in to my size 2 jeans again. I didn't realize at that time that it acts so fast because it incorporates interval training. The intervals help raise metabolism and burn calories all day. I have been doing punch kick and jam,cardio party and turbo jam remix on various days but nothing makes me lose weight and inches like fat blaster added in my exercise rotation. I usually do both fat blaster and another tape on the same day. I love everything about this video. If you like high energy vidoes and can jump around without problems then go ahead and get it. I wish chalean would come up with more and longer videos like this.

I just got a heart rate moniter and I burnt 198 calories with fat blaster and 257 calories with cardio party remix.",1262908800,2,1142,4.112107623318385
2680936,5,B000JZ2VB2,"Turbo Jam Fat Blaster is fantastic!  I consider myself an intermediate to advanced level of fitness, have completed all of Jillian Michaels videos, Biggest loser workouts, some of the Firm workouts and have never had the amount of energy I have during the day after completing Fat Blaster!  It is so much fun and the time just flies by!  I have only been using it for 3 days, so I can't comment on the results yet, but you will sweat and you will move! Great buy!",1257984000,2,463,4.3604651162790695
2680937,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This is an AMAZING workout. Constant high energy, and fun too! I thought Cardio Party 1 was super fun but MAN, fat blaster is the way to go with 4 turbos and with only 30 mins. Time flies and it feels like you are just doing some crazy dance routines. Of course you are jumping a lot and lunging, punching, so your heart rate is always up there. I don't recommend this for people who are just starting TJ, or those who aren't into super fast intense workouts. This made me sweat more than running 3 miles, but it was bearable and fun! The exercise routines are fresh and not too dancey, but they are all different and you will burn major calories. I use this after I do Turbo Sculpt or the Live Booty Sculpt + Abs DVD and I feel much better after I've eaten a lot of junk food! My mom did this with me twice and she says she has lost inches already! I'm pretty fit so I don't notice anything but I do know that I am sweating more than I ever have before, and I have taken cardio kickboxing, TAEBO, and I run on the treadmill and on an outdoor track, and this is the best workout I've ever done. I will be back to update. Right now I'm at 119lbs. Try it, you won't be disappointed!",1250640000,,1180,4.068669527896995

2680939,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I love Turbo Jam, and this is another great one.  You get a warm up and then 4 turbos with a learning session before each one, followed by a cool down.  I like that it is only about 30 minutes, and yet I wish that maybe the intensity was a larger portion of the 30 min.  Can't complain.  I love Turbo Jam.  Such a fun workout!",1241740800,,326,3.878787878787879

I have recommended it to friends and they are falling in love with it too.  I combine Turbo Jam workouts with a Fluidity workout bar I bought from Craiglist and I saw results after doing them for only a week and a half(and others noticed too!).  Turbo Blaster is one of my favorite Turbo Jam workouts because it makes me sweat, sweat, sweat, completely worth it.  Go buy it, go buy it now.",1235865600,3,535,4.115384615384615
2680944,2,B000JZ2VB2,I love turbo jam punch kick and jam.....so i got this video and it is a quick workout but it does not seem to be as effective. It is very repetitious. I would spend the extra 15 minutes and do punch kick and jam.,1235433600,,212,3.840909090909091

As usual Amazon to the rescue, I figured 12 bucks for one dvd was pretty darn good. My expectations were not too high, especially with some of the reviews that stated the steps might be hard to follow. Well, I have been doing it for a week now, and yes she goes fast but if you continue to do it, you get the hang of it! And, it really is so fun, that o.k I can't say that I forget that I am working out because it is CHALLENGING, but I love it!!!!

2680947,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I bought the Turbo Jam Fat Blaster a few weeks after I started my Turbo Jam workout because I felt I wasn't being challenged by the ""5 Rockin' Workouts"" set.  I also get quite bored with anything that is more than 30 minutes long.
Overall, I think the Fat Blaster DVD is fabulous; I have never sweat so much during a workout at home.  There is a fast-paced warm-up, then you jump right into the turbos.  There are four sections of turbos--learn them and then do them full-throttle.  By the end of the last turbo you'll have your hiney kicked!
I recently added the weighted Beach Body workout gloves, and that amped up my workout and made it twice as difficult!  I like this because you can make it as easy or difficult as you want, as there is always someone to watch with lower-impact modifications.
I would also like to mention that I have never been a regular at working out--and normally avoid it at all costs because of boredom.  Now that I've been doing Turbo Jam, I no longer get bored, and have been doing it consistently (6 times/week) for the past 6 weeks.
Finally, I would recommend doing this with a weight/resistance workout, as you will see results much quicker than by doing the Fat Blaster workout alone.",1233878400,3,1220,4.497737556561086
2680948,4,B000JZ2VB2,"If you have shaky knees like I do I would advise you to do this work out on your urban rebounder if you want a harder work out. I noticed when I do some work outs on the rebounder my knees don't hurt if you want high impact. Otherwise on the floor do low impact. You sweat more on the rebounder if you do high impact and have bad knees.

Otherwise great work out with the exception of the cueing. Doesn't happen very often and sometimes I get lost :)",1230940800,,450,4.0
2680949,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I purchased the beach body collection and have been doing turbo jam for about a year. I thought that was pretty fun until I tried the Fat Blaster, now that is awesome. Its such a great work out, its very fast and so much fun, the music is up beat and it makes it go quicker than ever. In such a short period of time you will have done a great work out and feel great. This one will make you sweat! Its a lot of jumping and most of the moves are the same from her previous videos. It doesn't teach the moves very well for beginners so I would recommend doing the beach body fist and then trying this one out, otherwise it might take you a bit to learn the moves. But either way stick with it because it is worth it. This is one of the best work outs I've ever tried I would recommend it to anyone. I am the type of person that gets bored easily and keeps trying new things, but this is so much fun and is the only thing keeping me from gaining weight through out the holidays. Since I've been with turbo jam I've gone from a size 14 to a size 8, I have 3 kids so I don't have time to go to the gym but thanks to turbo jam I am able to do a quick work out and lose the weight I absolutely love it and I know you will too!",1229990400,5,1219,3.784313725490196

2680951,5,B000JZ2VB2,"I've been using other Turbo Jam tapes for awhile now, but just LOVE this one! It's exactly what every workout routine needs. It's HIIT which really helps break plateau's, in fact it broke mine, and is just 30 minute's. The moves are easy enough to follow even for someone who's never tried Turbo Jam before. There are 4 turbo's, which are the high interval intensity, but each of the 4 begin with a lower impact version of what's to come. So you learn the moves slow, than rev it up for the fat blasting impact! Great,great tape!",1217635200,5,529,4.463917525773196
2680952,5,B000JZ2VB2,This is a very good dvd in the Chalene Johnson series. I already had the Cardio Party 1 but was looking for something a bit more challenging. This dvd pushes you a little bit more with its relatively fast beat and lasts only 30mn for days when you're a little bit too short on time to do the whole Cardio Party. A very good buy!,1214870400,6,328,4.061538461538461
2680953,5,B000JZ2VB2,"This one is packed with the Warmup and 4 Turbo's compiled from other Turbo Jam workouts! You do each one in slow/learning mode, and then you repeat it in turbo mode. And, since your going from low impact to high and then back to low then to high, it revs your metabolism. I know that another review said that the que's are terrible, but they are there. Plus, these workouts are meant to be done a few times a week, and since you will learn the routine and get more used to it, you would eventually tune the ques out anyways and just have fun with the work out. I would definately reccomend this one to any one wanting to add to their Turbo Jam collection.",1213747200,10,655,4.2063492063492065

But it's 30 minutes of full-body, sweat 'till you drop workout!  Great workout!!  Yes, the ""teaching sessions"" are a little dull, but once you know what you are doing, you can add intensity to those and end up with a great workout!  I recommend this to someone who likes to sweat and get the workout done quickly, but still wants results.",1212624000,6,454,4.487804878048781
2680955,5,B000JZ2VB2,"If you are getting in shape for a wedding or other special occassion buy this DVD.  I own almost every Turbo Jam dvd.  Fat Blaster is one of my favorites.  If you're looking for a fun, effective, intreval workout this is for you.  The workout last 30 minutes (with a wonderful warm up and cool down)and you will sweat!  It's so much fun it feels like 15 mins and you'll want to do it again.  This is a very high energy workout but includes low intensity demonstrations for those new to TJ or for those who may have weak knees.  The cardio sect of the workout consists of 4 turbos (1.5-2.0 mins of high energy cardio)!!  That's right 4 but do not be intimidated to try this out!  Chalene does a slow version (walk through) followed by the same turbo at full speed.  Many of the turbos are taken from her other workouts so if you're familiar with those you should have no problem.  If this is the first video you try take it slow and get used to the moves.  Chalene says this is to be used only for special occasions---but I find putting it into your rotation will help bust through any platueas.  Anytime I want to have fun, feel accomplished and get a really good quick workout I grab my gloves and go. (you know it's really fun when your 5 year old asks if you're going to do the pink tj so she can try to do it with you)  Happy turboing!!",1210809600,7,1340,4.18359375
2680956,1,B000JZ2VB2,"I'm a fan of Turbo Jam and workout daily.  I also spent many years as a dancer, so I consider myself a pretty quick study, but this video drives me crazy.  I feel like I'm watching some sorority that I am not allowed to join. Chalene is ABYSMAL at cueing, and in this format it really shows.  She rips through the ostensible ""teaching"" portion of the Turbos, which seem to have a new move every 8-count or so.  Then, during the time before starting the high-impact portion, when she could be reviewing, she just stands there (or hops, as you know, Chalene never sits still) and says ""Are you ready?  Are you ready?""  I'd much rather she was previewing the first few upcoming moves.  Sometimes I get so frustrated with the quick choreography that I just run in place to maintain the intensity of the workout.  I have gotten used to some of her signature moves/combinations in her Cardio Party series, and have come to really enjoy them, but this one I just can't get used to.  She could learn a lot about cueing and teaching from Shaun T.  My recommendation:  pass this one up and start with some other Turbo Jam videos, or give Hip Hop Abs a try, you'll spare yourself a lot of frustration.",1210118400,14,1190,4.43778801843318

And you want to come back and do it again to get all your steps right. For those who say the cuing is bad, she doesn't give the most exact cues but don't whine about it. do the tape get the steps down!

It has everything you want in a great a workout, I think my favorite is the cool down where I am forced to stretch (something sometimes overlooked when working out on your own) causing little pain in my muscles afterwards.
