8489376,5,B005Z16SXC,"This 2 DVD collection was a real treat to watch.  I saw their show at the Mirage in the early 1990's as a kid, and this brought back some great memories.  I felt like I was right back there!  I highly recommend it to any fan.",1468022400,4,225,3.847826086956522
8489377,5,B005Z16SXC,"I only saw Siegfried & Roy once.  The show was beyond description.  They took Illusion to a level beyond belief.  They were The Grand Masters of Illusion.  The Animals seemed to love the attention from the audience, as much as  Siegfried & Roy did.

I've never found a complete recording of their show, wish I could.  This DVD set has many clips from their acts.  Tells what inspired them to create those specific affects.  It shows them raising their animals and caring for them.  They'd known their Large Cats, since those cats were newborns.  This set also tells about how Siegfried & Roy respected nature and worked to preserve the White Tiger Species.

Delighted to have found this set.  It's a Tribute the Legendary Performers Siegfried & Roy",1464566400,5,748,4.75
