539251,5,6303039693,"This 1941 masterpiece, a remake of the 1922 Valentino classic, starring the legendary Tyrone Power in the Valentino role, with Linda Darnell and, in one of her first big roles, Rita Hayworth. The Technicolor cinematography of this masterpiece is absolutely stunning, the colors practically leap off the screen. You can't get that look in modern movies anymore; all movies today are too bright or too dull.
Anyway, its time for Fox to release this title on DVD, along with The Black Swan, Captain from Castile and others. Tyrone Power is a trully excellent and underrated actor, and his movies must be released on DVD.",1076457600,8,617,4.9423076923076925
539252,5,6303039693,"""Blood and Sand"" based on the novel by Ibanez and presented by 20th Century-Fox is a masterpiece of old style Hollywood filmmaking.  Director Rouben Mamoulian pulls out all the stops to present this Technicolor flushed romantic story of Juan Gallardo who is portrayed by the impossibly beautiful Tyrone Power. Juan grows from a poor boy dreaming of glory in the bullrings of Spain to the epitome of arrogance and ignorant of the cost to his soul of his fame.
  The three principals of the story are, Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell as his childhood sweetheart Carmen, and Rita Hayworth as the seductive and hollow Dona Sol.
  Tyrone Power presents us with a marvelous, energetic portrait of a young, brash and over confident Juan. His first close-up bursts the edges of the screen and burns in the colors of Goya. Tyrone Power was made for the movies and cinematographers Ernest Palmer and Ray Rennahan film him with as much care as they do the two female leads. Thus this overpoweringly beautiful close-up sucks the viewer into the world of Juan and one is swept away by his charm and bravado.  Mr. Powers's performance is almost overshadowed at first by his physical presence but as the story progresses his talent as a film actor takes over and sustains the viewer to the end.
  Linda Darnell, a great beauty of the movies and by her own admission, not much of an actress, turns in a very good performance as Juan's discarded wife Carmen. I do not agree with Miss Darnell's opinion of her talents. One only has to look at ""Letter to Three Wives"" to see what an accomplished screen actress she was. And here too she takes the thankless role of Carmen and makes one care about the poor girl.
  Then we have Rita Hayworth who here in ""Blood and Sand"" sets the standard for the great-lost beauties of the silver screen. Her Dona Sol is everything we hope for in the empty shell of a femme fatale.
  It is said of her, at one point in the film by a newspaper critic of bullfighting, as he points to the ring: ""Gentleman, if this is death in the afternoon, then she is death in the evening.""  And Miss Hayworth lives up to every inch of his description in this her breakout performance.
  In the garden scene where she performs the ""Toro!"" seduction and sings to her victim Juan, she is utterly captivating and irresistible in her Travis Banton gown and cascading titian hair. Here we see the birth of Rita Hayworth and the demise of Rita Cansino.
  Also worth mentioning are Anthony Quinn as one of Juan's boyhood friends, Manola De Palma and the wonderful silent star Alla Nazemova who is heart breaking as Juan's mother.
  The music by the masterful Alfred Newman sets the tone and emotion of the film. Lush and full of the sounds of Spain it is one of his best.
  Darryl Zanuck believed that story was everything in film. Without a good story you had nothing to build a film on. In ""Blood and Sand"" the head of Fox proves his point and gives us a great movie presented in the grand style of  Hollywood's golden age.",1072137600,68,3012,4.549165120593692

539254,3,6303039693,"An early Technicolor melodrama, featuring Tyrone Power as Juan Gallardo, a boyish, beaming matator who starts life as a brash country bumpkin and rises to the top of his profession, then loses it all when he falls for the wrong woman.  Linda Darnell co-stars as his faithful, good-girl wife, and Rita Hayworth is the wicked Other Woman.  With clenched jaw and rigid posture, Hayworth is mysteriously unappealling and surprisingly unsexy in her role as a high-society vamp, while Power is entirely believable as a good-natured but uneducated jock who doesn't think with his head.  The script is slow-moving and obvious, but does give a glimpse into Spain's toreador culture, and features one nice bullfighting sequence which gives a good sense of the balletic excitement -- and brutish cruelty -- of the sport.  Quite enjoyable if you're in the right mood.",1054944000,6,855,5.085714285714285

539256,5,6303039693,"Here's one of many old-time movies that will keep you from boredom. When I first saw ""Blood and Sand"". I thought it just ""another boring old movie!"" My parents convinced me that it was REALLY good, and boy, were they right! I mean, it's well. The acting is not the best, but they sure try. The bullfighting scenes and the song Dona Sol plays in the guitar is beautiful. She plays it in a very talented and special way. The Spainsh scenes are really wonderful. Sure, it's so old (1941,I suppose), it LOOKS old. But hey, you can deal with it, cause this ""Blood and Sand"" rocks!!!",980899200,7,577,4.401869158878505
539257,4,6303039693,"This sumptuous production, with its Oscar winning cinematography by Ernest Palmer and Ray Rennahan, is beautiful to watch. The use of color is spectacular, with brilliant blues and reds, and sets filled with shadows and light. The scene where we first see Rita Hayworth, a pre-corrida prayer, is an exquisite example.
The music by Alfred Newman is wonderful, and the marvelous guitar selections played by Vicente Gomez are a treat. The bullfight scenes are good, but very sanitized, and the one with the young Juan, practicing at night, is terrific.
I would have given this 5 stars, but for the casting of Tyrone Power as Gallardo. It's apple pie and milk instead of paella and vino tinto, and misses the mark by a mile. In the small part of the new matador that takes Gallardo's place in the ring and in Rita's heart, Anthony Quinn steals the show. He doesn't have Powers' eyelashes, but has the passion and intensity that would have made this film great had he been the leading man.",977961600,16,984,4.726744186046512

This is set in Spain in the late 19th century. Bullfighters and their fans celebrate in a tavern and boast. Soon there is a difference of opinion and conflict. A teenage boy climbs into a ring in the early dawn to play with a bull. Two men watch. This boy will leave for Madrid to learn bullfighting (and avoid the police). Johnny wants to earn a lot of money to provide a dowry for his sister and a better and more luxurious life for his mother. They walk 500 kilometers to Madrid. Can Johnny stop a train? Waving a red flag does it! Ten years pass. Juan Gallardo sees his picture in the newspaper (but he cant read). [No public school system?] The train arrives at the station. Another man attracts attention. Juan gives presents to his mother. People dance and sing, like happy peasants everywhere. Juan meets an old acquaintance (who asks for help). He hires a band to serenade a woman. Juan learns what that newspaper article said! Later Juan holds court for his fans. His experience and fame increase. [They build him up to create a tragedy when he falls.]

Life goes on. A woman plays the guitar and sings. [That fountain cools the air in a hot dry country.] There is only one true woman for Juan in the world. His relatives criticize him. What will happen in the end? Juans mother prays for him. Later his life becomes complicated with his wife and girlfriend. What happened to all the money he earned? Did he spend it as fast as he earned it? What is important in his life? Are these omens? One of his friends is badly injured and dies. [What are the premiums for life insurance for bullfighters?] Juan returns home and finds his mother scrubbing floors - to keep in practice for her future! [No Social Security there.] There is drama in a tavern. Juan decides this will be his last time in the bullring. Juan is applauded by the crowd. Magnificent! Then the crowd screams! Juan is wounded but vows to quickly recover. Does it hurt much? [Only when he laughs?] His wife will remember him as when she first saw him. Outside a new matador is celebrated. [Do matadors have a retirement plan? The bulls dont.]

This must be a copy of the silent movie from around 1920. It is a parable about show business, where a star stays popular for a limited time then fades away (unless dying while still popular). The era is not mentioned but there is no electricity or telephones or automobiles shown in use. Laurel and Hardy did a parody of the original called Mud and Sand.",1452124800,,2498,4.473684210526316

The image is somewhat sharper than the previous DVD and the color , though not as robust as a Technicolor film better preserved (such as Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz), the presentation succeeds in showcasing the visuals which emulate famous painters such as Goya, etc.

The director's The Mark of Zorro, also starring Tyrone Power, and photographed in stunning black and white, is a more tightly edited and entertaining film, but Blood and Sand is well worth watching nevertheless.",1441411200,3,638,4.962616822429907

Also a fine awareness of the Matador Culture and its religious connection to the craft through the Catholic Church in that period in Spanish Culture.

He does accomplish this., he is happy in his marriage,  then enters a woman I would like to throw off a very high bridge..As you guessed it,  his life goes all wrong..

539444,5,6303039693,"""Blood and Sand""(1941) is the first of three Technicolor Blu-rays that will be released by Fox this year starring Tyrone Power with the other two being ""Jesse James""(1939) and ""The Black Swan""(1942). Those who have any doubts about how these old Technicolor films might look on Blu-ray after seventy years can put all those doubts away. ""Blood and Sand"" looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray and if you're a fan of Technicolor films from this era then you'll be pleased. All the credit should go to the film restorers at Fox for bringing this film back to life in a dazzling Blu-ray presentation(Bitrate: 35.08). ""Blood and Sand"" won a richly deserved Oscar for Best Cinematography(Ernest Palmer & Ray Rennahan) but credit must be given also to it's director, Rouben Mamoulian who according to the liner notes ""based many of the film's set designs and color schemes on the works of master Spanish painters such as El Greco, Velasquez and Goya."" Many of the scenes in the film do look like paintings come to life and that is brought out to amazing effect in this Blu-ray presentation. For a film that's over seventy years old, it looks brand new considering that some Technicolor films released recently on Blu-ray look almost artificial. Not so with ""Blood and Sand"". Colors are vibrant, especially the blues and reds. Look no further than the toreador costumes worn by the bull fighters. If I had to pick one color that stands out among all the others in would be ""Gold"". You can see the smallest details in these costumes and will have a greater appreciation to all the hard work the costume designers did in making each one authentic. The story is a familiar one, that of a poor boy who rises to the top of the bull fighting profession only to be brought down by his ego and the wrong woman(the beautiful Rita Hayworth). All the actors look great in Technicolor. Tyrone Power was one of the most handsome leading men in films and his good looks are really on display in this one. However, acting honors go to the beautiful Linda Darnell as his faithful and long suffering wife. Nazimova, the great silent star, comes in a close second as Tyrone Power's mother. Spoiler Alert: For the record, there are only two bullfighting scenes in the movie, one about an hour in(this is the longest) and a short one at the end which closes the movie. Both scenes are done tastefully all things considered. ""Blood and Sand"" is 125 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.33.1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish. Audio is as follows: English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0; Spanish and French Dolby Digital 1.0. The only negative I can say about this beautiful Blu-ray from Fox is that it came in one of those awful Eco-cases so if you have any old HD cases laying around you might want to switch the picture insert and disc into one of those instead. To sum up, many thanks to the restorers at Fox for beautiful work they did on this Technicolor film from the Fox Catalog. It comes highly recommended.",1374019200,21,2994,4.704761904761905
539445,5,6303039693,This is one of my all time favorite movies. The color in this film are wonderful. And a better remake of the silent one...better acting also. Linda Darnell was one of the great beauties. She Played the Blessed Virgin in Song of Bernadette by the way.......I love this film because i always wanted to go to Spain. Seville the most. And this is the only film iam aware of that has the Esperanza Macarena in it. It is the Blessed Virgin title as patron of Seville.

539491,4,6303039693,"I will use my husband's account to share my views on this old classic.  Sangre y Arena (Spanish for Blood and Sand) is Vicente Blazco Ibanez's most popular novel.  Written in 1909, it was made into films several times.  Unfortunately, it suffered the same fate that befalls all books that are translated to the screen: the story is butchered and changed till it barely resembles the original in the book.  ""Experts"" tell us that this is inevitable, you see, and it has to be done in order to accommodate the exigencies of film-making.  Oh, well.  If God allows ""experts"" like that to exist in this world it means they are necessary, too.

However, if you didn't read the book, or if - unlike me - you are not usually bothered by the butchery of books at the hands of the film industry, you can't help enjoying this stupendous old-fashioned melodrama (I did, too, even though I did read the book; in the original Spanish).  This rags-to-riches story has everything: handsome men, gorgeous women, love, jealousy, passion, infidelity, you name it.  Tyrone Power is good-looking and dashing as Juanito Gallardo.  Your heart will go out to Linda Darnell, who plays the lovely and constant wife, Carmen.  And Rita Hayworth is her usual irresistible self in the role of Dona Sol.

You might find some of the acting a little overdone, but don't let that interfere with your enjoyment of the film.  Remember, this was done in 1941.  Like everything else in life, acting has changed since then.

I encourage everyone to read the book to get a real feeling of Spanish culture and the way things were there in 1909.  And then, enjoy the film.  Just don't compare the two.  It will only ruin both for you.",1337385600,,1692,4.658783783783784

All the elements for a great classic film but I just couldn't believe this was directed by the same man who had done ""The Mark of Zorro"" only two years earlier. My one word review would be ""ponderous""!",1258675200,2,637,4.5964912280701755
539496,4,6303039693,"Blood and Sand (1941) is a Technicolor film produced by 20th Century Fox, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Rita Hayworth, and Alla Nazimova. It is based on the Spanish 1909 novel Blood and Sand (Sangre y arena) by Vicente Blasco Ibez.

There are two earlier versions of Blood and Sand; a 1922 version produced by Paramount Pictures, and starring Rudolph Valentino; and a 1916 version filmed by Blasco Ibez himself, with the help of Max Andr.

As a child Juan Gallardo (Tyrone Power) wants only to become a bullfighter like his dead father. One night he has an argument with the pompous critic Natalio Curro (Laird Cregar) about his father's lack of talent in the bullring. The argument spurs Juan to travel to Madrid and achieve his dreams of success in the bullring. Before leaving he promises his aristocratic sweetheart Carmen Espinosa (Linda Darnell) he will return when he is a success and marry her.

Ten years later Juan Gallardo (Tyrone Power) returns to Seville. He has become a matador and uses his winnings from Madrid to help his impoverished family. He sets his mother (Alla Nazimova) up in a fine house and ends her existence as a scrubwoman. He lavishes money on his sister Encarnacion (Lynn Bari) and her fianc Antonio (William Montague) so they can open a business and wed. He hires ex-bullfighter Garabato (J. Carrol Naish), who has become a beggar, as his servant. Best of all he is now able to marry his childhood sweetheart Carmen (Linda Darnell) as he had promised.

Juan's wealth and fame continue to grow along with his talents as a bullfighter . Eventually he becomes Spain's most famous and acclaimed matador. Even the once scornful critic Curro now lavishes praises upon Juan and brags that it was he who discovered Juan's talent. Although Juan remains illiterate doors open to society and he catches the eye of sultry socialite Doa Sol des Muire (Rita Hayworth) at one of his bullfights. His mother attempts to warn Juan that if not careful he will, like his father, end up on a path to destruction but Juan refuses to believe her.
Watch ver closely and you will se a young George Reeves, many years befor he epitomized the Super role that made him famous. He plays a small but memorable part as the Dona's first suiter.

Juan is blinded by the attention his fame has brought and Doa Sol finds it easy to lead him astray. He soon begins to neglect wife, family and training in favor of her privileged and decadent lifestyle. His performance in the bullring suffers from his excesses and he soon falls from his great heights as the premiere matador of Spain. With the loss of fame comes rejection by everyone who was once important to him. Even Carmen casts him off after she learns of his affair. With his fame now gone Doa Sol moves on to new up and coming matador Manolo de Palma (Anthony Quinn), Juan's childhood friend.

After losing everything a repentant Juan begs for forgiveness and is taken back by Carmen. He vows to change but first he must have one final bull fight to prove he is still a great matador. His prayers for one last success, however, are not answered and like his father before him he is gored by the bull. Juan dies in the arms of Carmen as the crowd cheers for Manalo's victory over the bull. Manalo bows to the fickle crowd near the stain of blood left in the sand by Juan.",1227484800,2,3367,4.631490787269682
539538,4,6303039693,"""Blood and sand"" is one of the most famous novels of Blasco Ibaez, that somehow retakes the myth of Icarus about the story of the son of a famous bullfighter, from his impoverished ages of childhood to his unequalled fame as the best Spanish bull fighter, idolized and loved for many women.

His superb reaches a turning point when he was seduced by an alluring woman - Rita Hayworth-, although she is aware he `s a married man, and how this ethic deviation will lead him to a fatal disgrace, here you have the essential pivot of all tragedy according the Greek pattern, the violation or transgression of the rule will blind the humblest of men.

Tyrone Power as the disgraced bullfighter, Linda Darnell as his suffered wife and Hayworth as the ""fatale femme""  complete a narration that will be completed with the basic elements of the Spanish culture, the bullring, the devotion for the Macarena Virgin, the flamenco and other minors issues that constituted a well rounded film without that used ornamentation or bombastic feature that nourished other similar films of the Forties.

This movie has the best color ever. I use it as a reference disk to show off what Technicolor was REALLY like.

Truly any one of the  movies below could be studied for the art of Technicolor. Many of them are over 40-50 years old and sparkle like new. Due much in part to Warner Brothers restoration process.

2) Singing In The Rain

3) The Garden of Allah (with Marlene Dietrich)

4) Auntie Mame (with Rosland Russell

5) Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn)

539543,4,6303039693,"'The Mark of Zorro' and 'Blood and Sand' confirmed Rouben Mamoulian's enduring concern with drama conveyed through movement of characters and camera... The former was a rousing, deliciously ironic swashbuckler; the latter an adaptation of Ibaez's story about a simple country boy whose success as a matador leads him into temptation and towards a violent early death... Rudolph Valentino had scored one of his biggest success with 'Blood and Sand' in 1922, and the same story served as a Tyrone Power vehicle nineteen years later...

Color, and Mamoulian's almost choreographic direction, turned the motion picture into an exquisite melodrama, where all the passes and swirls of the bullring were vividly depicted: The parade of the bullfighters and their entourage, the race of the vicious predator into the arena, the matadors flashing their yellow and pink capes...

Rita Hayworth blood-red lips and scarlet fingernails, contrast the cool colors of her Spanish mansion, and show her off to glittering advantage...

In her sensuous screen Pasadoble with Anthony Quinn, she looks sensational in her rose evening gown, symbolic of the Spanish bullfight flavor...

The arrogant and passionate dance, based on Flamenco dancing that characterizes the man as the matador and the lady as his red cape, is performed with style and surety... The colors, rose and green, are blended to perfection with the amazing prowess of an appealing couple in tune with the balanced perfection of shapes and the sweeping movements of Rita Hayworth...

Quinn is perfect for redoing old Valentino roles... He always demonstrated his grace and remarkable agility on the dance floor... This sequence remains one of the movie's best remembered moments...

Mamoulian begins the film with a 30 minute prologue, establishing the characters ten years before the main narrative...

Juanillo, just a little boy with fire, vigorously illiterate but possessing his father's passion for bullfighting, is seen by night currently taking the bullfighting world by storm... Not least for his exceptional brave and agile style of fighting but also for his age... Juanillo adores the art of bullfighting... Hr runs off to Madrid with his boyhood friends, Manolo, Nacional Pablo and La Pulga...

After winning a certain reputation as a 'flat-footed novillero,' Juan (Tyrone Power) returns years later to Seville to marry his childhood sweetheart, Carmen Espinosa (Linda Darnell - a voluptuous beauty with perfect complexion), and brings her to live in his luxurious home where he has installed his mother (Alla Nazimona) and his sister, Encarnacion (Lynn Bari).

Then he goes on to become the 'first matador in Spain' showing his individual personality by the combination and variations of his passes... Juan brings the bull past his body with the elegance of a premier ballet dancer, making it seem effortless and beautiful...

As his popularity climbs Juan's entourage of hangers-on increases joining his boyhood friends Nacional (John Carradine), Manolo de Palma (Anthony Quinn), La Pulga (Michael Morris), Pablo Gomez (Charles Stevens), Sebastian (William Montague), and his loyal dresser, Garabato (J. Carrol Naish) who left the ring just as he came in to it, 'without a peseta.'

But all is not so perfect in the ranks of Juan's cuadrilla... Nacional is anxious to leave bullfighting for politics, and Manolo, jealous of Juan's success, wants to make his own name in the ring... And then there is the on-going feud Juan has been engaging in with Natalio Curro (Laird Cregar), the famous bullfight critic who had insulted the memory of his father...

When Juan established himself as Spain's most important matador, Curro opportunistically affirms: 'At last Sevilla has a matador. The greatest matador of all history. The first man of the world. The day he was born, there was salt in the air, a great quantity of salt.'

And at one of Juan's 'great afternoon', we are introduced to the stunning Doa Sol des Muire (Rita Hayworth) whose chief passion is bullfighting and, in particular, handsome matadors...

The torrid Spanish beauty had little difficulty, in luring the new risen star away from his home...

Falling under her tempting beauty, Juan begins an affair with her at the expense of both his faithful wife and his career... His skills as a matador go downhill and his bad attitude loses him all his once loyal friends...

'Blood and Sand' is sensitively directed by Mamoulian and might be considered one of the greatest examples of Technicolor film-making... The film won an Oscar for Best Color Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Interior Set Decoration...",1166400000,3,4639,5.248648648648649

539546,4,6303039693,"""Blood and Sand,"" stars Tyrone Power as Juan Gallardo, the son of a matador who died in the arena.  Juan vows to be even better than his father, and gradually does become the most honored bullfighter in Sevilla.  Along the way he marries his childhood sweetheart, Carmen (Linda Darnell), and falls under the spell of a wealthy and heartless socialite (Rita Hayworth).

When this was made in 1941, movies focused on vibrant Technicolor, dramatic stories, stirring music, and beautiful stars, sometimes to the exclusion of subtlety  or accuracy in the script.  Such is the case with ""Blood and Sand.""  It is glamour all the way, with sumptuous costumes and lead actors that are startlingly handsome.  Power is charming as the swaggering matador, Darnell is the picture of devotion, and Hayworth is drop-dead gorgeous as the playgirl who uses men.  None of them look, speak, or seem particularly Spanish, however, nor do the supporting actors such as John Carradine  and George Reeves (TV's Superman).  The dialogue tends to be clich&eacute; and melodramatic and the few Spanish words are mispronounced, but the point of the movie is to enjoy the visual spectacle, and that is very easy to do.  The bullfighting scenes are stock footage, filmed at a distance, so there is no gore.  Overall, this is a very pleasant film about pride, love, and ambition.
