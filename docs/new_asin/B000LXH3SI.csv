2717676,5,B000LXH3SI,"I am dismayed to hear the remaining seasons may not be released.  I am a new watcher over the past year or so of the reruns on WB.  I love it and my kids love it.  We purchased season one and I was hoping to purchase season two.  This is the first time I have ever reviewed something like this or thought about buying a series on DVD.  The quality of the show is great, deals with current issues in a mature way and in a way young people will think about.  There are two few good shows on TV right now and this one was definitely one of them!",1170720000,15,542,3.881818181818182
2717677,5,B000LXH3SI,"I purchased the 1st season on DVD awhile back and love it. The storyline is great and the characters are wonderful. The show should never have been cancelled in my opinion. It is being played in reruns on WB, but it just is not the same as it would be having the seasons on DVD. This the best show I have seen in quite awhile. I certainly hope that the other 3 seasons will be released soon. Anyone who watches the series most certainly will be hooked. I am.",1170633600,23,458,4.157303370786517
2717678,5,B000LXH3SI,"From the gossip I hear, Warner Video may not ever release Seasons 2,3, and 4 on dvd because of the poor sales of the first season. This is very unfortunate for many reasons. One, they never properly promoted the first season which accounts for the poor sales. Two, the CW prematurley cancelled Everwood (for another season of 7th Heaven, which has turned out to be a big mistake on their part). Third, look at all the work the fans did to save Everwood. We raised a ton of money to rent a ferris wheel to show how wrong the CW was. That's commitment. The least Warner video could do is release the last 3 seasons on dvd. This show is show's quality is amazing. The writing, the music, the acting. It had it all. I really hope some executives come to their senses and think of the fans.",1170547200,18,785,4.3108108108108105
2717679,4,B000LXH3SI,"Even thought this title has not been released yet (yet being the key word), I feel they should bring it out. This show has a very good moral content that illustrate's how to deal with ""life-like"" situations and doesn't ""sugar-coat"" all circumstances. It's a shame that they took it off the air and ran another season of 7th Heaven in it's place. 7th Heaven ran for 10 seasons and should have retired and let the ""little guy"" grow. I feel the producers of 7th Heaven got caught up in the obsession of having a series run a record of 11 years and lost focus of a quality show. This season of 7th Heaven has been weak, superficial, and disappointing. I feel it's a little too late to reproduce the show, but releasing it on DVD would be pleasing.",1170460800,18,743,4.391304347826087
2717680,5,B000LXH3SI,i agree.. i am anxiously waiting the arrival of everwood the complete second season! this show should have never been taken off the air! i feel as if it was the change of nights and times that took away from the show's reviews.  i strongly feel this was one of the best shows ever created!,1170374400,16,289,4.254545454545455
2717681,5,B000LXH3SI,Everwood was and is one of the best tv shows to ever grace our television screens.  I have purchased Season 1 probably over a yr. ago and am still anxiously awaiting Season 2.  It seems like forever that I have been waiting and can't understand what the hold up is.  Please release the 2nd Season so more people like myself can enjoy a quality show over and over again.  This show is definitely worth a 2nd season release - give us what we deserve and the credit that this show deserves!!,1170028800,86,488,4.329670329670329

We have watched season 1, & then bought this Season 2, & are 1/2 way through it, & we will definitely be getting Season's 3 & 4... The ONLY problem we have with this is that they stopped making it after Season 4... What were they thinking of?

There were unfortunately only 4 seasons. Recommend for the whole family.  Story lines for all ages. This was my favorite series ever. I am in my 60's, but it is great for young and old. Don't know of anyone who watched it that didn't like it. Many of us waited a long time to finally get the 4th season.  Well worth the wait for all the seasons.",1398643200,,497,4.26595744680851
2717741,5,B000LXH3SI,Wholesome series that is good for the whole family.  You can't help but fall in love with most characters and almost hate another but their character teaches a life lesson.  This is right up there with 7th Heaven & Touched By An Angel.  Highly recommend it.,1396915200,,257,4.543478260869565

2717744,5,B000LXH3SI,"I always am a fan of a box set, but in this case I bought the individual series because the price was much better. I thought this was a great show on TV, and Treat Williams is a fantastic actor. He can display such great emotion that you don't see that often from male actors. You find yourself just wanting to hug the TV to give him comfort in this show, because he is so tormented by the loss of his wife. It's funny, its sad, & everything in between.",1393459200,,453,4.044444444444444

Truely, an excellent combination of story line, lead actor (check him out as the substitute teacher/military expert in his movie, he's great in it) and each supporting actor just fits perfectly.  Both young men, the lead guy's relatives and his main love interest, the young ladies, everyone just nails it.  Excellent dialogue, great Colorado setting, strong story lines, consistent humor.  I mean, I can't think of a weakness.  Only weakness was they ended the series.  It was sweet that they wrapped up the story lines for us in the final season.  What can ya do?

2717768,5,B000LXH3SI,"I love the show. I used to watch it when it was on. I had forgotten how good of a show it was until now. I will collect all seasons but........the packaging of this product leaves alot to be desired. I ordered the first season and what I received was heavy plastic stuck to thin cardboard with a very thin strip of tape. I attempted to take it out of the box and the plastic came away from the cardboard immediately. Not too bad considering the second season I received was flimsy plastic that was busted in several pieces. When I attempted to open the packaging everything fell out on the carpet. Now mind you, the box it came in was unscathed not a mark or a dent. So I'm hoping that Amazon is not knowingly sending inferior products. I will give them the benefit of the doubt since this is the first time it has happened but if it happens again I will purchase my dvd's elsewhere. I have hundreds of dollars in tv shows from Amazon and all good quality packaging and in good condition so I'm very disappointed.",1297296000,,1013,4.30890052356021

The series itself, I was hooked when it aired originally. When they released the first season I bought it immediately, but it wasn't until I had purchased the third season that I realized they were releasing others. Since I had the first and third season I couldn't watch the episodes out of order, so I found the second season and couldn't be happier.",1284076800,,479,4.443181818181818

I really recommend that you watch it. You'll be satisfied.

In this second season of the series things get a little spicy with Amy, a girl Ephram meets at his new high school in the first season, and it turns out that he likes her, but still they haven't gone out yet because of her boyfriend who was in a coma in the first season comes out of it in the second season but later dies later in the season. You'll enjoy it, I guarantee it.",1278806400,,664,4.107692307692307

We recently saw the series on sale and bought them and as we re-watched them 4+ years later, it brought back some very good memories of our time together and were still discussion starters from a whole new perspective for each of us.

After the show's run I came across the first season for a very reasonable price and thought ""why not"". I was hooked from the first episode. The show had great acting and writing...why is it that shows like this don't last longer? I recently loaned the first two seasons to a relative who absolutely can not be happy with any television show. He picks the show apart and critizes the acting, storylines, etc. Well...he was very upset that he would have to wait until June to watch the third season. THAT was the only criticism he had for this show! Excellent series!",1270684800,,689,4.476190476190476
2717779,5,B000LXH3SI,"I hadn't seen the everwood when it aired on tv. But when the first season came to dvd my cousin bought the first season and let me barrow it since I hadn't seen it.
 instantly I was hooked. I found it a deep, emotional ,exciting series. With great characters , wonderful stories that truly pulls you in and keeps you wanting more.

The second season builds nicely on the events that took place in the first season . One Character's development bugged me, but everyone else made up for it.
Plus there are many improvements to make up for it. Many of the stories are even deeper to the point you might be in tears after watching . You really feel for the characters, This show may truly be one of the best shows ever on TV. Defiantly one of the best on the WB . Which is saying alot because back in their heyday they had some great shows.

If you have yet to watch everwood I highly recommend you give it a chance assumming you like amazing drama's with real life problems and successes

One Note: Don't start with this season, You must see the first season to start with as if you don't see it you won't get as much enjoyment or have the understanding of things refferenced in this season.
Once you see that I'm sure you will defiantly want to get your hands on this season.

I just wish the 3rd season would come to dvd. If anyone knows if it is please let me know via e-mail at animefreak1983@gmail.com . I'm dieing to see it.

The characters are simply charming and delightful and every one of them impacts the story.  The story line leads you through a realm of emotions.  It's hilarious, joyous and uplifting, cute, sweet as well as serious and tearful.  You find yourself living the narrative through the characters, whether your a parent or a teen, and those associations are very powerful.  The writers are truly talented in their craft and the actors perfect for each role.  A real true to life plot that each episode leaves you yearning for more. I adore this show and my heart aches for the release of seasons 3 and 4.  Anyone who watches will feel the absolute same way, thirsting for more.  Buy it, enjoy it and spread the word.

After watching the first disk of season 1, I looked online for the remaining seasons on DVD and I was SHOCKED to see they have not (and may not) released them!

I don't know whats the deal with WB that they are making all this series with no spanish subs, thats a real shame, the same thing happened with Smallville season 8, I mean, It a BLURAY disc! A lot of space! And they still don't get the subs in. That is the only complain that I have about this season. The rest is great and I hope that we all can get the rest of the series soon (with spanish subs please!!!) Now about this set, I love that it comes in widescreen, season 1 came in full screen, not much of a fan of fullscreen format :P. I really like the package, it feels really tight and safe for the DVDs, and its even smaller that the package of season 1 :). This series is great! Thats pretty much all I have to say.

2717791,5,B000LXH3SI,"The show is great. My whole family watched every episode of seasons 1 and 2 (some for the first time) and we look forward to seasons 3 and 4. It is well written and the actor's performances are very believable. There is a great mix of comedy and drama.

I do wish there had been more special features (at least bloopers or commentary), but among my family (of 5), I am the only one who wanted this.
I'm also not a fan of censorship and didn't like that the audio of a curse word in one scene was still muted on the DVD (it just takes me right out of the episode). Especially since the blurb in the included booklet highlights the use of a curse word (again, I was mostly alone in this - others noticed but didn't seem to care).",1252713600,,727,4.119718309859155

Another show that I liked even better than Everwood was ""American Dreams"", which also ran 4 seasons (not nearly enough) but only Season 1 has been released on DVD. I suspect that music rights may be an issue with this series being released on DVD, but what a shame for us fans!",1252281600,,539,4.294117647058823
2717794,5,B000LXH3SI,"Season Two of EVERWOOD is a splendid follow up to its rookie season.  It is large focused on three major relationships that the show's three main characters have:  Andy Brown's relationship with Dr. Abbott's sister, played by Marcia Cross; Ephram's relationship with Delia's college-aged girlfriend, played endearingly by CHUCK's Sarah Lancaster; and Amy's ill-advised relationship with a guy with a drug problem.  The most original of the three was Emphram's.  It was a classic case of the right guy and the right girl meeting each other, but at precisely the wrong time.  It is a challenge for any show to pull off a 16 year old boy and a 20 year old girl dating (ten year later it would have been a big nothing), but they did it well without pulling any punches.  Even as you know that Ephram and Amy will end up together (I am watching the show for the first time -- Seasons One and Two on DVD and Seasons Three and Four thanks to a friend show is a fanatic for the show and has lent me her VHS tapes, a pretty large box of them -- but it is one of those shows where you know from the outset who is going to end up with whom, the whole show being a ritual about how the writers can invent enough ways to keep them apart), you enjoy watching an impossible yet oddly healthy relationship.  And one of the characteristics of the show is that it then takes some nasty twists and unexpected turns.

Season Two is filled with many highlights, including a couple of guest appearances by James Earl Jones as a grumpy old man who befriends Ephram and becomes his tutor in jazz piano.  Bright, who started the series off as a jerk, gradually becomes Ephram's best friend and a very likable character.  And there are several nice guest appearances, like J. K. Simmons, who plays a mechanic who ""hears"" things about people's futures, Beau Bridges as someone who is building a lighthouse in his backyard, and an artificially endowed Kristen Bell, just before becoming a star on VERONICA MARS, as a high girl who has a breast implant rupture.  The saddest appearance was that of Kellie Waymire, a likable character actress who graced several TV series as a guest before died of a heart attack at age 36.  She appeared in shows like THE X-FILES and WONDERFALLS, and this was her final performance before her death.  It was nice that at the end of the episode they memorialized her.

I really have loved both seasons of EVERWOOD, but I wish the final two seasons were out on DVD.  There are some really good shows that still haven't been brought out on DVD.  The most grievous failure has been not bringing MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE out on DVD (how is that even possible?), but this is a close second.  Hopefully I can go back and review the next two seasons on DVD.

I do have two major quibbles with the show.  Near the end of Season Two Dr. Abbott's professional liability carrier suspends his insurance because they had not disclosed the medical condition of Dr. Abbott's sister.  I work in a med mal claims department for a major med mal insurance company.  There is no way in the world that anyone would cancel insurance!  They might up his premium, but  nothing more.  What a crock!  Policies might not be renewed for having some serious problems, but let's face it, there is only one way that the vast majority of people will not get insured:  failure to pay premium.  Anyone doctor or any hospital can get insurance if they are willing and able to pay the premium.  And $50,000 premium?  He should come to us!  He's getting ripped off!  (Now entering the no exclamation point zone.)  My second complaint is with the way the entire town ostracizes Dr. Brown after the death of Colin after the surgery that ended Season One.  It was simply not believable that a town would be so complete in its rejection.",1252108800,,3796,4.527165932452276

2717798,4,B000LXH3SI,I did not enjoy the second season as much as the first.  It is darker and far more serious.  I was thrilled that they developed the character of Bright.  It was amazing to see that transformation occur.  As far as the dvds go?  It would be nice to have some special features as this was an incredibly thoughtful and creative body of work and it would be nice to have extras such as interviews with the writers.  It's a great buy.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released.,1249430400,,486,4.161290322580645

2717800,5,B000LXH3SI,"Unbelievable how they really did release the second season. It's a miracle, I really hope they do come out with the last two as well. If you haven't seen this show. It is one of the best written (funny and witty) shows for families in TV history. Only the stupidity of Dawn Ostroff got this show canceled. Season two might be harder to follow if you haven't seen the first season, unlike season 3 and 4 which are more stand alone in my opinion. But it still has the same typical fighting scenes that we all encounter in our family lives and touches on issues like drug abuse, depression, love, sex and of course following your dreams. This is a show you can watch over and over again and still laugh at most of the scenes. Bottom line get both seasons and if the other two ever come out, buy them too! You will not regret it. ^_^",1248739200,,829,4.253164556962025

2717806,5,B000LXH3SI,"Everwood is one of those rare TV shows that genuinely understands and grapples with different human emotions through the family/friend/community spectrum. Many try but are not all that convincing. The honest narrative structures in this though, forms the heart of why this show ultimately succeeds. While the issues that are raised are nothing new in anyway, the narrative allows these issues to be dealt with such confidence and sincerity without being over-sentimental.

In order to make a brilliant family drama like this one, the actors also need to play their part. And they do! For example, Treat Williams is simply stunning as ""Dr. Andy Brown"" who provides us with a person who loves his job but at the same time continues to struggle raising his family as a single parent. Gregory Smith as ""Ephram Brown"" offers a true interpretation of an insecure teen wanting a bit of freedom. The show also has a great blend of drama and comedy and it is mostly through the invaluable Tom Amandes as ""Dr Harold Abbott"" that we receive our comic relief and see how wonderful the show really is. These are just some of the great actors that bring real depth to their characters. With such superb acting, we are ultimately captivated by these characters to the extent where we genuinely care for their actions and believe that Everwood is a true place in Colorado. It is rare for a show to do this!

After watching seasons 1 and 2, I cannot understand why the entire series is not out on DVD yet. It's a gem! I only hope they release the remaining seasons as this is addictive viewing in which you will be coming back for more. Highly Recommend.

As my title suggests, a unique masterpiece in the form of 'Everwood'...",1246665600,3,1710,4.712374581939799
2717807,5,B000LXH3SI,"I always miss this show, but just watching Season 2 nearly ripped my heart out. This show is just a perfect example of what television could be, and what for four too-brief seasons it was. Granted, the Madison/Ephraim story was always weak from the Madison side, but even Sarah Lancaster has to be applauded for such seamless execution of a storyline that in lesser hands would have been disastrous.
I watch these episodes and I am reminded what the craft of acting really is. The cast should be so proud of themselves, the writers and crew equally so.
As for the Season 2 DVD set, the only weakness is that it does not have the commentary tracks like Season 1 had. Otherwise, the material itself is just so ideally and fully realized, it cannot be less than five stars.",1246665600,2,770,4.546762589928058

One of the rare jewels to ever grace our screens for its four seasons & an all inspiring credit to its actors, writers etc.  I could go on however to put simply.

This is humbling, authentic mastery with an emotional heart and soul which clutches to this day.  PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3 & 4 MORE QUICKLY.  This show really is one in a million!",1246147200,,491,4.21505376344086
2717810,5,B000LXH3SI,"I got my boxset today from Amazon.com delivered to the UK.
Firstly - I was glad it played on my R2 DVD player. Warner Brothers are usually really good for this - I have many of their R1 releases that haven't been 'locked up'. Warner's American counterparts are far superior than the English releases which traditionally lack special features and get split into part-seasons. And Everwood will probably never be released in the UK! So this was the best option.

FINALLY I have another season of Everwood! Another 22 episodes to get lost in all over again. I loved the second season when it was on TV and hope seasons 3 and 4 follow - but for this to happen, I know WE have to purchase this one! So if you're undecided about it, don't be. Everwood was one of the underrated gems that often garnered critical praise but didn't always gather the masses as much as their sexier, hipper equivalents The O.C. and One Tree Hill did.
I don't know if you've tried watching the O.C. lately, but even a few years hasn't been kind to it. Littered with pop culture references and gimmick guest stars like Paris Hilton, its age quickly shows. Everwood created its own world, and even though its been 4 longggg years since last on DVD - the world and stories are as vivid, relevant and engulfing as ever.

There's been a quiet packaging change to a 6-disc plastic case slotted into a cardboard slipcase (which luckily matches the chunkier season 1 exactly!) but to be honest the change is for the better - I imagine we're all starting to run out of DVD space, so smarter packaging fits happier on shelves!

Go for it guys - you know Warner are going to keep an eye on this - so lets keep them coming.",1245974400,,1684,4.44336569579288

Due to music licensing issues, it has taken five whole years for the second season to finally get released on DVD. I can't recommend this series enough. While the first season is the best in the series, you still get high quality television with this show as it continues on across its four years. This DVD set is slimmer than the season one set, but it is very well made. It comes with an attractive episode guide and the art and promotional pictures used on the box, booklet and DVD's themselves really make this a nice looking DVD set. For such an affordable price, this is one show that begs to be owned. Let's just hope it doesn't take another five years for season 3 to arrive!",1245283200,2,813,4.3907284768211925

2717815,5,B000LXH3SI,"I try to avoid watching television, honestly, and something really has to make an impression for me to bother with it, and even then I'll only commit to two or three shows at a given time.  ""Everwood"" easily makes that grade.  No other show, other than the late great re-imagining of ""Battlestar Galactica"" had ever had me so impressed, or occasionally even floored, with the quality of the writing that I immediately found myself heading to the Internet Movie Database to find out who had written the episode I had just watched. Thus I became a fan of the writing of Michael Green, John E. Pogue, and Rina Mimoun, as well as the work of creator and producer Greg Berlanti, all of whom gave us passages of even literary quality.

What I found so attractive about the show along with the quality of the writing was that this was a show that followed three generations of characters with equal sensitivity and depth: teens, parents, and grandparents (or four generations if you separate the first-grader from the teens). It was not the standard WB teen drama, focused on sexy teens and their sexy lives. The adults were adults, the grandparents cool and interesting characters, and not because they were made ""just like the teenagers."" The opportunities and struggles of each of the characters were appropriate to their age and life circumstances, and were dealt with by the writers with distinct imagination, not fearing to set up ethical dilemmas that were both contemporary and not ""solved"" with easy or politically-popular answers. If anything, there was a consistent - and attractive! - emphasis on integrity that was welcome on a television drama. And for someone like me, growing up in Oregon, Illinois, I also found an attraction to a small-town setting treated well, without a hint of coastal condescension in the writers.

So I am sorry that I have to say that I am kind of disappointed by the quality of the second season DVD set. ""Everwood"" has had a troubled history with its DVDs. The first season DVD set, out in the timely way we expect with television shows these days, apparently failed to meet financial expectations for Warner Brothers, and so it has been five years until today's release of the second season set. The reason repeatedly given had to do with the admittedly wonderful contemporary soundtrack of ""Everwood,"" which in particular had the conceit of frequently having contemporary artists covering classic tracks of the 1960s and 70s, as well as a generous selection of originals. The licensing costs were prohibitive, fans were told, and the only way that this DVD set was apparently able to be produced was by replacing almost all the music (even cell phone rings) with unknown tracks by unknown artists, losing those associations of familiarity. In the first few episodes, for example, now notably absent are:

  ""One Fine Day"" by Robbie Williams
  ""The Things We Do For Love"" by 10cc
  ""California Girls"" by The Beach Boys
  ""Get Together"" by The Youngbloods
  ""September"" by Earth, Wind and Fire
  ""At Last"" by Etta James

You can't help but notice the change, if you are at all familiar with the originals. Although there is serious marketing of music going on, there is also more to these soundtrack choices than simply sound or style, which seems to have been the chief criterion used in replacing the music.  The replacement of Counting Crows' ""Anna Begins"" at the end of episode 14 (with its lyrical uncertainty) by a straight love song lyric results in really changing the mood and the foreshadowing of the story's conclusion.  There's an integrity to the original work, one that I hate to see messed with for such reasons.  Worst of all is the removal of Art Tatum music in the episode ""Three Miners From Everwood,"" with the Emmy-nominated performance of James Earl Jones as Will Cleveland, where they actually switched out specific music being DISCUSSED by the characters!  Myself, I cannot believe that those licensing the music would make such further demands: I would rather simply have my music in the episode as ""free advertisement.""

Whereas the first season had all the sorts of extras one hopes for with a TV season DVD set - deleted scenes, director, writer and actor commentary tracks, behind-the-scenes features - the second season set lacks all of that except for the addition of deleted scenes, and these are not even linked to their specific episodes. Even the menus are the sort of static bare pictures that you associate with the cheapest of DVDs, and that just about everyone could construct on their own computer. And even the packaging betrays this tendency, seeming too generic in that the most significant additions to the cast - Sarah Lancaster as Madison Kellner and Marcia Cross, in a pre-""Desperate Housewives"" turn in the wonderfully real and adult role of Linda Abbott - are absent. These two dominate the storylines of the season, but the packaging stays with ""standard"" photos of the core cast.

But for a DVD collection I am particularly disappointed by the loss of the commentaries. They are such a relatively easy feature to create - again, practically something that could just be recorded on a home computer - and they add so much depth to a collection of this sort. Most season sets skimp on this feature, I think, after having witnessed the wonder of the ""Freaks and Geeks"" DVD set, where just about every episode features multiple commentary tracks. That is a far cry from the two or three episodes that usually receive a single commentary track in most TV DVD sets. Given the exceptional standard of work by the writers, directors and actors on ""Everwood,"" those features were what I was most looking forward to, as otherwise one could still just watch the episodes off of the internet in their original form.

It is enjoyable to see the episodes on my television instead of my computer screen, of course, and the second season story arc is as solid as that of the first season, and continues in dealing with the consequences of those earlier events in a paced and realistic way, not indulging in the Hollywood tendency of having earlier events neatly resolved by the end of an episode or story arc. (Only in the fourth season did I find that the show started to slide a bit toward that WB Network emphasis of ""sexy teens and their sexy lives,"" but even then was only slippage and not yet a disaster. The show easily had a few more years before it would have come to a timely conclusion.) In particular, I have great fondness and sympathy for this season's Madison storyline, having also begun my dating life a girlfriend who was a few years older than me, and significantly more mature than I was. I can wince in sympathy to watching Ephram flounder about in an all too teen tendency to muck up a relationship by conjuring up far too much unnecessary drama.  I also very much enjoyed James Earl Jones making a wonderful ""character actor's"" part of Will Cleveland in a recurring role that justly earned him an Emmy nomination.

So it's delightful to have gotten something after all this time, but I can scarcely believe that the last year's work on producing these DVD sets resulted in something so minimal. Warner Brothers seems oblivious to the quality of what they produced here, as you see happen occasionally with some classic movie or show that takes years or decades to get serious treatment by its owners. I can only hope that even the diluted versions of seasons 3 and 4 will be made available, in hopes of future viewers getting a chance to enjoy what this group produced over four years. I feel like I need to find out which executive to get in touch with in order to volunteer my time to make the final collections: and I am so not a person who spends their life obsessing about television. So I feel like that impulse, too, just testifies to how highly I think of what these writers and other artists achieved.",1245196800,9,7903,4.774926686217009
2717816,5,B000LXH3SI,"Everwood was one of those shows that just had it. From the very beginning this show captured my heart and I was devastated when it got canceled after only 4 seasons. Everwood was the perfect mix of small town drama, family frustrations, and love.

I got the first season years ago and I even managed to draw my grandmother in and she hates most TV shows. I'm beyond thrilled that the second season is finally being released.",1244505600,,424,4.5064935064935066

2717818,5,B000LXH3SI,"Everwood, which sadly has been off the air for three years now, was one of the most underrated television shows of the modern era. Because it was on the same network as watered-down, trite shows like 7th Heaven, it was unfairly categorized as a teeny-bop show which it WAS NOT at all. Tremendous writing and superb acting along with a breathtaking landscape as a backdrop makes this show truly unmissable. To be honest, I think four seasons was a pretty good run although I would've liked to have seen at least one more solid year from this show. Please do not dismiss this show. If you are a fan of great writing with down-to-earth and flawed characters trying to make their way in this mad, unpredictable world- you'll love this show.",1243382400,,736,4.625954198473282

2717820,5,B000LXH3SI,It is very exciting to hear that the second season of EVERWOOD is going to be released on DVD in June!  EVERWOOD was such a well-written show with wonderfully quirky and poignant characters.  I own the first season DVDs and I was afraid I would never see anymore than that.  I will gladly buy each of the remaining seasons just as soon as they are released!,1242604800,,357,4.378787878787879
2717821,5,B000LXH3SI,"....You won't want to leave. Such as I found out that fall of 2002 when Everwood premiered on the WB. After such a phenomenally wonder debut season(one of the best I've seen), Everwood sailed into season 2 and it didn't disappoint. What was the outcome of Colin's surgery?. What will happen with Amy and Ephram?. Season one ended on a cliffhanger, and season 2 starts off with the wrap up and into what would be another wonderful season. Of course, it took 5 years for season 2 to finally come out!. Hopefully, we won't have to wait that long for the remaining 2 seasons.

Okay, if you are getting season 2, then you have probably seen season one, so there is probably no reason to get into what the show is all about since you probably already know. If you haven't seen season 2 yet, I will try to be as spoiler free as I can.

The season starts off with ""The Last Of Summer"", a wonderful season opener that reveals the outcome of Colin's surgery. It's a great episode that may lead to thinking something but then pulls the rug out from under you. It also features another Emmy worthy performance by Treat Williams near the end. What happens in this episode will lend itself to the path that Amy(Emily Van Camp)finds herself on this season. It can get a bit rough going, a little dark, but never short of brilliant, with great writing and acting all around(then again, this is Everwood, so that shouldn't be surprising). Elsewhere, Marcia Cross(Desperate Housewives)joins the cast as Harold's sister, Linda, and something blooms between her and Andy. But Linda has something to reveal to him and her family. Sarah Lancaster(Chuck)also appears as Madison, a new babysitter for Delia(Vivien Cardone), and a possible new love interest for Ephram(Gregory Smith). The rest of the cast is back and everyone shines in just about everything they do. They all have their characters down pat. And what characters they are. All of the characters are so fleshed out and real. No ""stereotype cut-out #1"" in the bunch. Tom Amandes continues to enthrall as Dr. Harold Abbott, the one time lone doctor in Everwood, who becomes more of a friend to Andy than a somewhat comical enemy from season one. Chris Pratt also evolves as Bright, who could of been a one night jock/bully like we originally thought in the pilot. His Bright has become a real person, and the relationship with Ephram was one of the show's greatest assets. But the young Gregory Smith and Emily Van Camp, the show's two main teens, are astonishing as ever. Wonderful young actors who seem to be way beyond their years.

So, besides the premiere, what else does season 2 of this great show hold?. Lots. Without giving too much away. A three story episode interlocks in the great ""Three Miners From Everwood"", complete with guest appearance by the always welcome Beau Bridges. ""Blind Faith"" finds Andy trying to help a reverend who is going blind; A health issue along with new romances spring up in ""Just Like In The Movies""; Thanksgiving rolls around in ""Unhappy Holidays"", complete with plenty of drama and a guest appearance from legend Betty White; A parent/child split in ""Family Dynamics""; Going to the next level in a two relationships that may not turn out how the characters planned in ""No Sure Thing""; The last 4 episodes are all wonderful too - ""Sick"", ""Do Or Die"", ""Your Future Awaits"", and the finale, ""The Day Is Done"". The finale may be my favorite EW finale out of it's 4 seasons. A deep family secret is created in this episode that will have big repercussions in season 3. It's just wonderful. Then again, so is this entire season. James Earl Jones also has a recurring role as Will Cleveland, who is teaching Ephram the piano. He received an Emmy nomination for his role. He is wonderful indeed!. I tried to be as basic as I could with the episode descriptions, and not let any names slip out. You should enjoy where the season goes as you watch.

Season 2 of Everwood is perfect television. It's a family drama laced with wonderful humor, real characters, and top notch writing, directing, and acting. Everwood is a show that allows it's main characters, as much as we have grown to love each and every one of them, make mistakes, some painful, do or say the wrong thing, make us upset and not like them at times, and allows for them to face and go through real consequences of their actions and those around them. A lot of family shows have ""special episodes"" where something is done with at the end of the hour, or a major issue is relegated to a guest star, a friend of one of the kid's or whatever who is never seen again. No, the characters on Everwood do it and they have to go by what they do. Some of it is serious, some of it is just life. It's a show that doesn't talk down to it's audience, or teenagers. It hits on some tough subject matter(this season and others)and doesn't shy away from it or wrap it up in a bow at the end of the episode. Just going listing things that are going on this season - death, depression, pills, hooking up with the town 'rebel', a health issue coming out as a couple gets serious, and so on. Taken out of context, it may seem a bit much. A bit soap opera-y. Seeing it together as a whole is a whole other experience. Everwood is a show with a lot of intelligence, creativity, heart, and a heck of a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera. It's all pulled together wonderfully. In my review for the season one DVD, I said that Everwood ""put fresh spins on old conventions"", and that remains to be true this year. You may see familiar things on Everwood, but they put their own stamp on it, or throw in a unique twist. And they have the actors and writers to pull it off brilliantly.

In the end, season 2 of Everwood was a fantastic year for a wonderful, warm, smart, funny, touching, poignant, intelligent show. A show that should of lasted longer than it did. Everwood is true quality televison at it's best.",1241222400,4,5935,4.532649253731344
2717822,5,B000LXH3SI,That was my reaction when I got the email that The Complete Second Season of Everwood is going to be released.  I already have Season 1 but I sure would want to own all four seasons.  This is the only show that really held my attention from pilot to its finale.

The acting was phenomonal and it literally hurt to see them cancel it.  I just hope that they will release the rest of the seasons on DVD as well.  Maybe even release a box set.

2717827,5,B000LXH3SI,I am not spoiling anything for those that have not seen the 2nd season. Season 2 from what I remember is it deals with moving on in a way. It deals with loss more than Season 1 showed. This season has a character dealing with a loss of someone and what happens after someone when they do. They get mixed up in a wrong crowd. Also Andy Brown tries to date again or at least get back in that groove. I liked this show in general because it is a story I can relate to. I give the show 5 stars for this season and I wish they would of supplied us with more bonus material but from what I read is we get about 40 minutes of Deleted Scenes. I would loved to seen some commentaries but Hey at least Everwood is finally coming out. I recommend this to those that haven't seen the 2nd season. 5 Stars,1238803200,,791,3.981132075471698

2717829,5,B000LXH3SI,"I agree - it's about time.

I can't believe all of the garbage shows that have had every season released, while a quality show like this has languished with only the first season (which was a 'cliffhanger') has toiled for about five years.

Having been lucky enough to have seen all four seasons previously, I can tell you the show keeps going well, with new (and interesting) storylines each season (I won't give any spoilers), all the way to the extremely well done series finale.

Drama/Comedy/Family - it does them all and does them well. For those looking for a 'sleeper' show they may have missed out on, it's hard to go wrong with Everwood, and at these prices (compared to other 20+ episode hour long dramas) it's a steal.

Now give us seasons 3 and 4 quick!!!

P.S. (to the studios) - I will give in and get this because of the quality of the show, however, what the studios/distributors did to Everwood (putting out one season and leaving everyone hanging) has kept me from buying many other series until EVERY season had been released.",1237852800,,1046,4.602150537634409
2717830,5,B000LXH3SI,i have seen many dramas over the years.  and i can honestly say that this is the ONLY good drama to me. The characters are sensitive but flawed human beings with real problems.  The show avoids several key pitfalls.  It doesn't descend into the supernatural (IE Smallville).  It doesn't have characters killed off meaninglessly (IE Lost).  It doesn't have unnecesary plot twists (IE Lost and Desperate Housewives).  The characters are sensitive human beings with real problems.  It doesn't shy away from any topic (IE anything from the 80's on back) and it doesn't shove a religious conservative agenda down our throats (IE 7th Heaven).,1237593600,,636,5.0576923076923075

Like some others posting here, several years ago I purchased a really crappy full set of seasons -- which, to my profound disappointment turned out to be bootleg and of low production quality (pieces missing, commercials not removed, etc.)  So to finally be able to get the REAL Season 2 is wonderful.  We can just hope that seasons 3 and 4, which were every bit as wonderful as the first two, will follow eventually.

For those who are wondering what the problem is with putting Everwood on DVD (when so many much less wonderful shows are clogging the shelves) ... the trouble is with the rights to the music used throughout the series.

Rather than using generic studio background musicians, the show's producers chose to use contemporary top-rated artists and their significant hit compositions and performances.  The result was worth it for the series -- the soundtrack was fantastic and helped make the show what it was -- but it created a HUGE problem for taking those shows to DVD due to the cost of paying royalties to the artists.  I don't know how this problem was solved, but it's likely that the producers are hoping the demand for the DVDs will be worth the trouble they must have gone through to make it happen.  (The first season didn't sell overwhelmingly.)

You fall in love with the entire town and all the cast and even find yourself thinking what it would be like to live in a small town.

For the most part to, it is clean, wholesome and family appropriate except for a few topics that you can skip over and few wrong decisions that all teenagers make, well most do.  It seems true to life a lot of the time.

2717842,5,B000LXH3SI,"After five long years (and hundreds of fan bombarding Warner Brothers Home Video), the second season of ""Everwood"" will finally be available on DVD!

""Everwood"" follows the story of a world-known neurosurgeon who decides to move his family from New York City to Everwood, Colorado after the sudden death of his wife.  Dr. Brown is looking for a change of scenery as well as a way to connect with his two long-neglected children 16-year old Ephram and 10 year-old Delia.

The second season of the series finds the family after they've been living in 'Everwood' for just under a year.  The family has gotten over the growing pains of the move and are well on their way to accepting that this town is their new home.  The transition is made much easier by the cast of quirky townsfolk that invade the lives of the Browns including OCD doctor Abbot (Andy's business competition and friend), Nurse Edna (Andy's 65 year-old newlywed ex-marine nurse), Amy and Bright (Ephrams love interest and rival), and our narrator Irv (the school-bus driver).  The second season adds ""Desperate Housewives"" star Marcia Cross to the cast Dr. Abbots prodigal sister whom has been living in the orient for a number of years learning different methods of practicing medicine.

But what truly makes ""Everwood"" special are the quirky story-lines (each episode like ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Gilmore Girls"" focuses on a different town event of some time), and the characters that over the years become impossible to grow to love.",1236211200,,1502,4.960159362549801

This allowed Emily VanCamp (now of Brothers & Sisters but this was her actual big break!) many times to showcase her versatile acting range, which she did. Other cast, like Treat Williams, Gregory Smith, Tom Amandes... in fact the whole cast is superb, like always. Sorry I'm just too excited I can't believe this day has finally come. I'm gonna be able to hold the season 2 DVD set in my hands, a day I never thought would come.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

I did catch maybe one or two episodes while it was on air... but I didn't grasp how much emotion was botteld up with in one or two episodes let alone a full season of Everwood.

I have come to my own desision that the only reason this tv show could have gotten canceled was do to the ugly merge of the WB and that other station...and became CW.... that same year the merge happened, two other amazing shows were canceled which is insane.

I've read on other websites the dvd's suposedly won't yield enough $$ to make it worth while... and again I thinkt his is an isane reason.

I still have one more episode to watch before I finish season one of Everwood.... I have had only one more episode to watch for the past week.... but knowing that there may not be another 'fresh' episode for me to watch is upsetting... it is like a book you don't want to finish... you'd like to last for as long as you can...

I liked the story, the characters and actors. They showed a part of United States that let you know there are still nice families, values and love. We always have to watch violent movies and a society that is lost. This was a very nice way to show there are cities where people care about people. It is a shame we cannot have 2nd season yet.

The characters were believable and the writing was top-notch.  What a sad commentary on our world today that complete seasons of silly, vapid series from the 80s can all be purchased now on DVD, but this series cannot.",1192060800,4,337,4.435483870967742
2717900,5,B000LXH3SI,"I was fortunate to watch all 4 seasons when ABC Family put on re-runs of the show.  Each season built onto the next, and the quality of this show never once faltered for me.  The writing, the acting, the themes, and the beautiful photographic sceneries, the music, and the most believable, wonderful characters you can relate to, understand, and learn from-- this is my favorite show.  I watch frivolous tv shows as well, but I have to say, this show is HIGH quality, and anyone who has never seen this show, I truly think they are missing out.  Every episode I've ever seen not only made me think, but also filled my heart with love, and made me learn something new that I can apply to life.  I can not describe what a rare gem this show was, there is no show like it out there, and I doubt any other will be out again any time soon.  It is truly a shame it got cancelled prematurely, and I am appalled that a show of such high values, and quality-- something the American people could learn a thing or two from had such an early demise.  Everything on this show was just priceless.  PLEASE RELEASE Season 2-4.

I guess I'll be recording it of the TV so I can get the rest of the seasons. Fine by me.. that just means less money for WB.,1190937600,2,415,3.8372093023255816

While today's tv is literally inundated with reality shows glorifying vulgarity,crassness & shock value, Everwood was confirmation that families are still families and we all have struggles & challenges to find joy,happiness and peace to make us feel fulfilled.  It has been a very long time since I felt that the writing quality and excellent cast of a television show inspired me enough to want to watch week after week, Everwood was an excellent series and I can only hope that seasons 2-4 are released in the very near future.  The series is worth sharing with others and I really do not understand why Warner Bro's has delayed the release of all seasons, it was a production to be proud of and to be enjoyed long after it left the air.",1189209600,4,896,4.622641509433962

I would have gladly tuned into the series every week if I had discovered it back then.  I was hesitant to start this show because of the fact that you can only get Season 1 on DVD.  However, after reading several reviews raving this brilliant show I decided to give it a try.

This show is amazing.  It is the most endearing, funny, poignant piece of entertainment I have had the pleasure of viewing.  The script writing is a masterpiece in itself.  The show is excellently directed and supported by actors who really know what they are doing, young and old.

I can't believe this show only had four seasons, what was the network thinking?  I also can't believe those four seasons aren't all on DVD.  This is one show that definetely deserves to be preserved.  All I see anywhere I look on the internet are the dedicated fans of this show who are sorely disappointed by the absence of the last 3 seasons.  I can't believe the first season didn't sell enough not to warrant a release of the second season and so on.

There are so many bad shows out there that are available on DVD, I just don't get it.  PLEASE bring us this quality show!!

I thought it did a wonderful job covering so many different family types, single mom, bi-racial couples, single dad, family unit. I was heartbroken when the show was cut short of what I had expected would be a long run.  There was still so many places it could go and it's ending was certainly something the WB could come back from.  Please release the last 3 seasons.

Lets just hope that if the second season does appear that they don't hype the price. I'm on the verge of buying 'Northern Exposure' seasons 1 to 4 as they are just beginning to drop in price. I would say that fifty percent of my TV viewing is from DVD so it's not just the availability it's also the price.

Everwood is a good easy to digest show that constantly reminds us that people are basically good. It's a pleasant surprise to find a show that doesn't rely on 'bells and whistles' (explosions, murder and sex) to get our attention. I therefore would recommend Everwood to anybody that is seeking a window onto the gentler side of life. Yes it's often a bit soapy but in a good way, a way that makes you feel that your are a part of the show creating a kind of intimacy between you and the characters.

Tonight, we finished the final episode of Everwood Season One.  This has been a wonderful experience for the whole family to watch together.  Our house went on the market today.  We are moving from an urban area to a rural area.  We feel this Everwood experience is helping us with the transition.  The hope that one day, maybe in a year or so, we'll feel the new place is home, like the troubled teen said in the final episode of Season One.

2717944,5,B000LXH3SI,"I loved this Television show, it sadden's me that whenever we have a good Television series; It seem's to get pulled and all the other shows have  6-10 season's. Everwood was one of the Television series I looked forward to watch, it was right out of peoples life's.

Hopefully the last three season's will be released soon.

2717945,5,B000LXH3SI,"It seems this is the only TV show you can not get the full series on DVD.  What is up with that???? It is not like there is not an outcry for it's release.  Then ABC Family puts it on TV and go and upgrade my calble only to find I am too late and it is off the air agian -- not even put on at a different time.  This show touch my heart in so many ways -- it was as if I was a part of their family.

I also want the complete series!  I don't need to watch TV to see other shows that are on that I enjoyed watching because I was able to buy the DVD series and I really don't care if they are on TV.  But EVERWOOD deserves to be released.

2717946,5,B000LXH3SI,"...demanding the release of the remaining seasons of ""Everwood.""  It is indeed trite to declare profound affection for a television show, but the fact that Everwood elicits such passion from its viewers serves as testament to the quality of the writing, acting, and direction.  I have watched many television dramas over the years, and I can honestly say that I have never--never--seen one that captured the human condition so authentically.  As other reviewers have rightly claimed, Everwood never pandered, never condescended, never simplified, and never compromised merely to reach the lowest common denominator in viewership.  Ultimately, I suspect this accounts for its untimely cancellation; it was simply too genuine and too smart for an American audience.

Those of us who realized what we had, however, deserve the opportunity to preserve this timeless jewel for ourselves.  I encourage others to fill this review board, contact Warner Brothers and/or ABC Family, and ratchet up the pressure to deliver the remainder of this series on DVD.",1171324800,194,1048,5.398773006134969
2717947,5,B000LXH3SI,"I happened to see previews for the show on ABCfamily, I'd never heard of it.  It was heavily advertised there, so I thought I'd check it out.  I watched it every single weekday for every single episode until the end.  I love that show.  It was emotional, delt with complex relationships in families and in love, as well as societial issues.  I want to have all the episodes to watch over the years as my kids get older and watch it with them.  To not release all the seasons would be a real shame.  It was replaced by 7th heaven reruns on ABC family as well.  I like that show too, but reading that Everwood was cancelled because of it makes me like it less.  7th Heaven is terrible now, CW made a mistake.  At least release the seasons for us lucky enough to have enjoyed it, so we can spread a great show around to our friends.",1171065600,30,829,4.189873417721519
2717948,5,B000LXH3SI,"Wonderful show... this is the kind of show you want to buy on DVD and watch on and off over the years. As soon as I know there's hope of Seasons 2-4 being released, I will buy Season 1. Until then, why torture yourself with cliffhangers and unresolved feelings... sigh...",1170979200,32,271,4.44
2717949,5,B000LXH3SI,"Everwood was without a doubt the best series that the Americans ever produced. Instead of the sugar-coated rubbish we are lambasted with day-in day-out, this series explored serious and sometimes contentious subjects without bowing down to political correctness or following the ""Happily Ever After"" conclusions that Hollywood demands.  It was a disgrace that WB pulled it after only 4 seasons, the last of which we in England are still waiting to see for the first time.  I bought the first season on DVD immediately and was  eagerly awaiting the release of the other three seasons - without success.  Then the rumour began to spread that WB were not contemplating releasing the other 3 seasons due to poor sales of the first and I hit the roof.  I am sure I am not the only person in the world who is completely bowled over by Everwood, there must be millions of Americans as well.  It would be nice if WB did something for its loyal viewers for a change and not just for the profits bottom line.  Everwood will remain one of the truly magnificent series of American TV and to stop the release of some of its seasons would be tantamount to cultural destruction.",1170892800,38,1163,4.671568627450981
2717950,5,B000LXH3SI,I love this show.  Unfortunately it was canceled by the WB (a very poor decision on their part) way before its time.  I fell in love with the characters and I sincerely hope that they will release the other seasons on DVD.  It is a fantastic show that tackles many difficult topics superbly and is exceptionally well written.  I purchased the first one and hope I can have a complete collection of the show soon..so please please please release the other DVD sets!,1170720000,22,464,4.554216867469879
