The man goes on to accuse Hakuoro of murdering his wife, child, and betraying his people. The kindhearted Hakouro has no memory of such a betrayal. Weighed down by confusion and guilt, Hakuoro is unable to focus on leading his people in the war. One night, in a private moment with Hakuoro, Eruru comforts him. She tells him that no matter his, he is a good man, and she believes in him. Her words give him a clearer mind. He can now focus on defeating the evil warlord that is rampaging through the country.

This anime keeps getting better episode after episode. Many anime series have filler and time spent on rambling. This show does not. So far, every episode is important. The characters become closer to each other, and we feel closer to them in turn. The action and drama continue to reach higher. This anime is shaping up to be an excellent series. I highly recommend it to any fan of anime. I'll keep watching and let you know how this turns out. Things are looking up for Utawarerumono!",1354492800,,1086,4.535714285714286

8177892,5,B000NIBUXK,"A mysterious man appears near a village one day and is discovered by a young lady and her little sister, orphaned charges of their grand mother who is the healer and leader of the village. He knows nothing of his past, and wears a mask that he cannot take off. He has a strange destiny about him, however- he seeks only to protect those around him, including the two girls who begin to view him like a father. Each choice he makes slowly causes more, and more, and more people to follow him until he rises from mysterious stranger, to village elder himself, to leading vast armies into battle against unknown enemies. I must say this is one of my favorite anime series... ever.  It has a solid and incredible plot, characters that draw you in with their cute and endearing qualities and deep emotions. The story starts very simply, and draws you in - but the plot quickly engages you and becomes incredibly vast and complex.",1187222400,,924,4.532934131736527
