3912062,4,B002DP0J24,"This is family viewing and with a very believable script. It deals with a bunch of issues that kids come across lots now. And it shows that people can change. It is refreshing to find decent movies out there. I am so done being ""rolled in the gutter"" by most movies.",1261958400,25,266,4.235294117647059
3912063,5,B002DP0J24,"I was drawn to this movie because it was filmed in my grandparent's house (Mr and Mrs T. T. Patrick).  My mom sold the property a few years ago and this was filmed there subsequent to that.  It was great to see that the producers kept most of the interior as is.  They even used a coffee cup that I took there about 32 years ago.  On top of this, the movie had a nice theme.",1260057600,6,374,3.8815789473684212

3912065,5,B002DP0J24,"This is a great movie from several perspectives.  For the Christian faith, it is a beautiful example of the role of possessions in our lives.  It illustrates that Biblical principal that when we lose everything that our culture values, we can gain everything that God values and gives real meaning and purpose to our lives. We are reminded of the power of one person to make a difference in the lives of many and that salvaging abused children can lead to their salvation.

The movie is a must see for those working with foster children. It honors the noble and sacrifical work they to do and the need of our society to care and support our abused children for our sake and theirs.",1255305600,88,681,4.520325203252033
3912066,1,B002DP0J24,"I was eager to see this movie because it was filmed locally and used some extras and scenery from the town where I live.  People who are watching it for the same reason are the only ones to whom I would recommend it.  I get the fact that it is trying to mimic the 'feel good' aura of Hallmark movies, but this one just did not work for me.  The acting is not great, the film quality is terrible, the dialogue is stilted, and the plot leaves you scratching your head.  Even fast forwarding through the story to get to the scenes filmed locally left me bemoaning the fact that I'd wasted an hour of my life that I'll never get back.  Unless you have local ties to a person or place in the movie, don't bother.",1254873600,14,707,4.131386861313868

3912077,5,B002DP0J24,"This movie was a wonderful surprise. While it may not be the best film ever made, it's certainly an epic adventure. Cary Elwes was perfect for this movie, and I think he brought a lot to both his role and the movie as a whole. The acting was good all around, especially the kids. The editing was good, and the script was decent. Did they go for a few cliches? Sure, but that didn't ruin the movie for me. This film is unique in it's style, and I like that. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. There are a few things that I thought could have been better, but overall, the film is good. The quality is good, and you can tell that the director really knew what story he wanted to tell. I would recommend this movie!! I know I'll watch it again!

update: I have now watched this movie through a couple of times and I really like it even more than before!! Please give it a chance, it's a good movie!!",1492732800,,915,4.083333333333333

Without spoiling the movie for potential viewers I will say that this movie is packed with mystery, intrigue, and it has just enough pulling of the emotional heartstrings to make just about everyone happy.

Pick this one for movie night if you have kids...I think you will be glad you did.",1491350400,,483,4.415730337078652

3912125,5,B002DP0J24,"I am stunned by the reviews I've read.  Here are a few points that need clearing up:

There is no elderly black woman in this film.  It does NOT take place in Georgia or any other land locked state.  There are no accents of any kind.  This film also has nothing to do with promoting a religion of any kind.  It's a story about family.  Period.

The film is about two brothers who are sent to spend time with an unknown uncle who lives on an island.  They learn that their family was once worth millions and owned the island, but their grandfather (who disappeared under mysterious circumstances) buried his treasure and left clues for his sons as to where it was.  They never found it... And now the children have to find it to save their family, and the people who live on the island.

This isn't a spoiler.  That much is all in the trailer for anyone to see.  Anyone who says it's about anything else hasn't bothered to watch the trailer, much less the film.

It's an excellent film , but you won't find any religious leaders or even churches in it.  Watch it because you like Nickelodeon or ""lifetime"" style  films ( though this has higher quality, as it was directed by the same guy who did ""The Dark Knight)",1486166400,11,1212,4.34375

3912147,4,B002DP0J24,"This was a pretty good movie with a good message. This MIGHT be considered a ""family friendly"", and for the most part - it is,  but that depends on one's view of a ""family"" oriented rating. I say that because many a family film I have seen over the years had zero suggestive words and not even one act of violence, where there were few that did, yet still kept a family friendly claim. I don't recall the actual given rating, but this would be a PG in my view. With that said, there were arguably only...that I recall...2 mildly suggestive words, and 2 mild scenes of violence(one involving a survived gunshot). No nudity - only a teenaged girl walking around in short shorts and a bikini top(that matters to some). So strict parents would just have to ask themselves what age group they see this fit for. As said, if you watch a lot of Hollywood films, and I'll add - especially if you watch a lot of action and horror movies where morals don't matter, then both the movie and my review will apper comical to you...you've seen worse. I wanted to leave a review for parents who want to have confidence that the movie they are about to present to their family is acceptable for everyone at every age, because honestly - this movie gives that vibe, and again - in today's media this IS family based, just with a couple of ""Oh, I didn't expect that"" moments while watching with my 4 year old.",1485820800,18,1389,4.383720930232558

There are some elements, pills, teenage mouthing off and some drug related foster care issues that I doubt any responsible parents would want young kid's hearing...no swearing though gratefully.  This would be ok for teens and adults...This movie is about how life continues to change and how we have to accept that and allow ourselves to change in that process as well.",1390867200,2,429,4.930555555555555

To me it had a reality of life where a rich woman after the death of her husband lost everything and started all over sharing a home with orphans.  God has plans for us all and this movie shows where this widow was truly needed.  It is a great movie for families.,1377129600,,366,4.27536231884058

3912256,4,B002DP0J24,"A good Hallmark Channel movie. A once or twice a year movie at best. Some I will watch more often. I did like the story line and the characters. It's about a lady whose husband dies leaving her with a much smaller inheritance than she expected. In fact, she loses everything except a run-down Southern home occupied by a foster family. Being the owner of the house, she moves in and as the movie progresses she makes unexpected connections with a troubled teen and the rest of the 'unwanted' kids. As advertised... it is a 'touching drama'.",1366156800,,540,4.577319587628866

Hard to capture any emotion in the female lead's face but the rest of the cast was pretty good. All in all, I've decided to keep the DVD but I wouldn't buy it new knowing what I know now. It's good enough but, compared to others that I've purchased of the same genre, it wasn't super.",1363219200,,373,4.3428571428571425

Having been abandoned by my mother at young age and unable so far to have children of my own, I was so inspired by this story of left behind people who come together in love to make a family of their own. The acting is not especially refined, but it is more than good enough. And the script may well be predictable--as some have accused--but it is earnest and meaningful.

Kudos to everyone involved in this film.",1337040000,,451,4.369047619047619

3912272,1,B002DP0J24,"I like to rent Christian films and this one looked pretty good. But I was wrong. I'm sorry but it's really, really awful. The acting is awful, the plot is a little flimsy (how exactly did this wealthy woman end up penniless upon her husband's death & be forced to live with a foster family in a rundown house in the South?). And then there's the random ""elderly"" African American woman, clearly played by someone in her 20s, who appears at times with little bits of wisdom or criticism or I don't know what, but she is totally random, and it's just krazy. I actually fell asleep during this movie. It's just not worth it. Yay for taking in foster kids, yay for Christian films...just not this one.",1327536000,13,697,4.453125
3912273,3,B002DP0J24,"I am always looking for great Christian movies as we don't even allow regular braodcast tv in our home.  I do agree with most of the other 4 and 5 star reviews as to the great lessons you can learn from this movie.  But the filming was shaky, the acting was corny, it was slow-paced, and they threw the ending on there abruptly.  I purchased this from American Family Association as I like to support them and buy my family-friendly movies from them.  I love Fireproof and Courageous and Facing the Giants.  I liked The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry, The Pistol, most of the Love Comes Softly series, and more.  So I DO like great Christian films, but this one just didn't do it for me.  I really would like to give this movie a higher rating.  It was just too unrealistic and corny I think.

I do agree with the Dove Foundation rating for it... that it's only suitable for ages 12 and up.  There were rougher foster teens with bad attitudes and language that I wouldn't want young ones to see.",1321747200,17,991,4.366120218579235

3912282,4,B002DP0J24,"This is a very touching movie about a recently widowed woman who had a stillbirthed
child, but was otherwise childless.  She was quite wealthy, but finds out that her
fortune was lost, and only has left an old house in Georgia that is being used as a
foster home.  She goes there with the intention of selling it, but soon finds it
her second calling in life to help take care of these, and hopefully future, foster
children.  This is a fine family film, with a few generic religious moments, and
some humorous and sentimental sequences.  The 5 foster children are quite good at
showing their troubled pasts, particularly the 2 teenagers, who are quite believable
when being angry and sullen.  The foster parents are very plain everyday people,
no more saintly than their charges.  While some scenes seem obvious or stilted in
dialogue with the supporting adults, and no doubt action fans will find this film
corny at best, I believe this will please the majority of people and families for
whom this was intended.  And without giving too much away, those old enough to
remember Jane Wyman in ""The Blue Veil"" will see some similarity in the ending.",1282348800,18,1148,4.71
