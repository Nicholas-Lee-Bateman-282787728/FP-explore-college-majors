I am an western so i know from where i speak. The story is combination of politics, history, love and sports (cricket to be exact and you will even learn something about how cricket is played)

The music and lyrics are poignant and beautiful. Yes bollywood movies are musicals. The songs in this one deal with British imperialism, love, nature, and life. Most of the dance numbers are staged outside. Some with big flourishes with the entire village dancing. Other times intimate songs and dances that capture the passion of two people in love. The traditional Indian dances are exhilarating and the singing will leave you breathless. Sometimes the songs do repeat themselves so just fast forward them a little. But all in all the musical numbers are captivating and exhilarating.

The plot dealing with British imperialism will teach you a history lesson. Political intrigue and an interracial love are the glue that hold it together. You will see the clash between Indian culture and British rule. This film will give you a look into an exotic land that few of us will ever see. And for this alone you should see this film.

Do not overlook seeing this movie. This is a musical that uses the power of song and dance to tell a timeless story of people overcoming adversity against tyranny and oppression.",1305849600,,1481,4.8
