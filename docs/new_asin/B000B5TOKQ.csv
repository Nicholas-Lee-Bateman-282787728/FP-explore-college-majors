8081683,3,B000B5TOKQ,"I have another version of this Disney movie, but this one surprised me. My other Disney version  begins with the story of Morris the ""Midget Moose"". This version starts with a story of a man and his wife and goes on about his adventures while trying to find Walt at the Disney studio. I would not recommend this version for a kid. They will get bored and oh yeah the story is in black and white. The feature movie of the ""Reluctant Dragon"" is in color.",1443484800,2,452,4.255813953488372
8081684,4,B000B5TOKQ,"I find this to be a very good blend of a documentary and fantasy. How did they manage to take a movie concept that could have been a very dull documentary and mix it in with generous doses of whimsical cartoon characters?  Only at Disney.  And for about two and a half minutes, Walt himself appears. I have been partial to Donald Duck ever since childhood and am pleased to see him well represented in this movie.",1423872000,,413,4.35064935064935
8081685,5,B000B5TOKQ,"I highly recommend this video for all ages.  It is cute, hilarious, and heart warming. Every time the children play it I find myself sitting right there with them, watching it again. It has my grandson saying ""Egad!"" to everything. An oldie but a definite goodie!",1237334400,,263,4.717391304347826
