I've tried tai chi before with men leading and have found the forms challenging and not quite natural.  These forms in this presentation come so effortlessly though.  Oh I'm not saying I can follow along the whole routine with anything like perfection, but I do feel confident that it won't take too long to follow with some essential competence and, certainly, benefit.

I also love that the women in this video are mature and obviously healthy.

Am this only 4 stars mainly because of the volume.  I am hard of hearing and so have good external speakers on my computer, usually capable of blasting me out when turned up to full volume.  But with this CD, I need full speaker volume PLUS my hearing aids, which I dislike and which detract from the experience.  Even with all that I miss some words.

Also, beware, Claire performs the full routine front and back before breaking down the moves.  I suspect I'll come to appreciate this approach but at first go, it was a little daunting.

All in all I'm thrilled to have this and hope to keep at it.  I really enjoyed day 1 and feel much more alive as a result of watching and trying.",1517184000,,1278,4.476190476190476
8114337,5,B000ETYZ8A,"As a judge of many Tai Chi tournaments, I knew the minute I saw Claire Hager perform her style, that she was the teacher I had been looking for to inspire more women to get involved with Tai Chi. She did not disappoint. Her power, grace and vast knowledge of the subject along with mastery of many styles brings a depth and wealth of details to our 5 star DVD.",1488067200,,360,4.1571428571428575
8114338,3,B000ETYZ8A,I am a beginner to Tai Chi and it is taking me awhile to grasp the movements. But plan to still use this DVD as I learn more from Mark Johnson's beginner series for seniors. Ms Hager is in partnership with Mark Johnson.,1414627200,2,219,4.116279069767442
