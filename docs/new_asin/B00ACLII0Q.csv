The cinematography is excellent, the story is most compelling, and the interviews done were both inspirational and saddening. My only regret is not having a translation of the Portuguese-speaking people who were interviewed during the South American leg of the journey. Although one gets a sense of what the woman who was describing her thoughts about those who were enslaved and brought to Brazil by the colonial powers of the time, it would be far more powerful to understand exactly what she was saying. (The same goes for one of the indigenous interviewees who is one of the sole survivors among her tribe who were decimated by the diseases and the deleterious results of the attempts to convert them to Christianity by the conquerors from the Old World.

Nonetheless, the portrayal of the rigors of Darwin and his crew, his insights and interpretations of what he saw, the science that was conducted along the journey by the film-makers, is highly illuminating and instructive. (The background music is perfectly suited for this film.)",1421452800,,1093,5.072222222222222
