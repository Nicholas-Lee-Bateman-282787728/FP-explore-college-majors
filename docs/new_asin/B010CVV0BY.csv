7308977,5,B010CVV0BY,"Really great and fun family film. I watch a lot of these as part of my job and it's really a crapshoot.  Lots of movies market for kids, just hoping that tired parents will take a chance.  But not this one.  There's a ton of heart and this was clearly a passion project for the people who made it. Very heartwarming and a great message. I'd totally recommend.",1438819200,4,359,4.25
7308978,5,B010CVV0BY,"I was really impressed with this film. Its subject matter is important and heart-warming, and it's executed fantastically.",1438560000,3,122,5.833333333333333
7308979,5,B010CVV0BY,I watched this film with my children. We learned so much about the deaf community. What an inspirational story for deaf and non-deaf audiences!,1438473600,4,143,5.0
7308980,5,B010CVV0BY,"I'm a student in an ASL interpreting program, and I first saw this movie in the theater with classmates and loved it. When the ASL Club at school had a showing of the film, I dragged my husband (who doesn't sign at all but wishes he could), my teenage son (who signs very little and doesn't have much interest), teenage daughter (learning to sign and LOVES it), and three younger children (11, 9, and 8, all of whom sign a little and think it's cool). Teenage daughter thought it was wonderful; younger kids liked the superhero aspect; husband (somewhat surprisingly) liked it--he  could really relate to one of the characters; and my son said, when we left, ""That was actually a pretty OK movie."" That right there is high praise coming from a 15yo boy!

Plenty of sign language, which is great for both native ASL users and those learning the language. All spoken English is captioned for Deaf viewers. All ASL is captioned for hearing viewers. The film's message is both inspiring and educational, while remaining entertaining and engaging. Can't recommend this film highly enough.",1437955200,10,1083,4.817204301075269
7308981,5,B010CVV0BY,This is an amazing movie.  It is something that everyone would like and would appeal to anyone.  It is captioned as necessary so both Deaf and Hearing people can enjoy this movie.  It is vey inspiring and really makes you think!  Loved it!,1437350400,7,239,4.488372093023256

7308983,4,B010CVV0BY,"Really enjoyed this movie. Clearly it's geared towards kids with a strong message of equality and diversity in cultures other than the mainstream focus of ""black vs. white,"" and some of the ignorance portrayed in this movie is a bit over-the-top (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars). But overall, this was a positive message with a fun script and well worth the time to watch it. Doesn't hurt that the lead, John Maucere, is a cutie.",1499126400,,436,4.531645569620253
7308984,5,B010CVV0BY,"This is an excellent movie to helping ASL students to connect to the challenges that deaf kids and adults deal with and the levels of discrimination & bullying that kids deal with.

My students watched the 1st half with a sub & throughout the day I began to get Remind messages from my kids that they were mad or that a part had upset them. Try as I might I couldn't figure out what could have possibly cause such reactions from them. Finally 2 students in my 6th period explained what upset them and I laughed out loud. They were not offended but outraged at the injustice and treatment of Tony & Jacob by the hearing world. They wanted to reach in to the movie and ""school"" those ignorant people. Secretly I cheered inside... I had managed to develop compassion and respect for the Deaf and their language.",1490140800,2,808,4.45945945945946

7308991,5,B010CVV0BY,it was very cool,1482019200,,16,3.25
7308997,5,B010CVV0BY,"I was born a deaf mute and was taught very little sign language basically only I love you and the ABC's.  My parents didn't want to recognize it and only did so when they could ""fix me""  Their words not mine.  I remember the struggle to communicate and my 7 year old sister who taught me how to sign the little I know.  It was difficult because I got beaten a lot because I couldn't hear.  I learned to face people when they talked watch their mouths and figure out what they were saying to avoid the beatings.  Now I can hear and speak but I will never forget the pain of being rejected by my parents and everyone around me.  So if you have a child in this situation it would behoove you not to cut them off.  Learn to sign with them and support them.  Trust me they will love you for it but if you don't they will find it really difficult to connect to people later in life and no matter how many or how few people accept them they will ALWAYS feel alone!  This movie should be seen not only by your child but also by you!!!
In saying this I mean no disrespect.  Everyone does what they feel is best.  Keep an open mind and a loving heart!!!",1481673600,2,1143,4.053571428571429

7308999,5,B010CVV0BY,Wow.  The messages and lessons in this simple and moving story would enrich and educate any hearing person who watches it.  Definitely one of the most enjoyable and worthwhile movies I've seen in a very long time.  Wish there were many more like it.  It deserves 10 stars.,1480550400,,272,4.604166666666667

7309010,5,B010CVV0BY,"I thought this was a great movie. Deaf movies and I have a love/hate relationship. Iiiiii hattttee readingg the subtitles. Glasses get to hurting my eyes after awhile. Generally use them for reading only. And the subtitles get to going so fast sometimes, it makes it really difficult to keep up. I keep threatening to learn sign language but, it's just something I haven't stepped off into yet. Anyway, I thought it had a great message, as all deaf movies I've seen have.",1471392000,,471,4.686746987951807

7309015,4,B010CVV0BY,"Checked it out of the library, I wear a cochlear implant and have always been in mainstream (aka in classes with non-deaf kids) I thought this movie was a rare find and I liked its positive messages throughout. I thought it was kinda off how negatively they were portraying the dad's side of the argument (get the kid a cochlear implant & interpreter in class)...in my opinion, I think both parents were right and should've gone online or found people with deaf kids so they could find a compromise after speaking with some experienced parents. My solution would've been get him a C-Print (captionist in the classroom) and a cochlear implant. Get the kid to try that in a regular classroom for a month or two and see if he likes it. If not, that's fine, just take him to the deaf classroom. Sorry, that was my only thing with the film...and how could the parents NOT fill their kid's IEP during school????That's super important??? I thought the movie was really funny at some point I noticed how quiet the movie was. I thought my battery went dead a couple times lol. Anyway, I hope this awesome movie paves the way for more movies with deaf protagonists, deaf writers, deaf directors, etc! We can do anything!",1467244800,,1210,4.606481481481482
7309016,5,B010CVV0BY,I highly recommend the movie as it gives one an insight into a deaf person's struggle in life.,1464307200,,94,4.277777777777778

7309019,5,B010CVV0BY,"Outstanding movie!  Highly recommended for all ages.  Full of Deaf culture tidbits and Deaf people.  Hurry and watch today, you don't want to miss this movie!",1463270400,,158,5.0
7309020,5,B010CVV0BY,"This movie touches on a LOT of Deaf culture; some of it is pointed out and some is subtle.  It also touches on conflicts between the Deaf and hearing world from a Deaf point of view. This movie follows the lives of two people - an actor and a young boy - and their lives eventually come together.  This appears to be a movie with a message for hearing people from the Deaf community. I like how a lot of the personalities in this movie are obvious so it is clear and easy for people/kids to watch.  It also emphasizes the realities of what is portrayed.

Personal note: Make sure you know there are 'deaf' people who are not a part of the 'Deaf' culture. Do not use this movie to base your actions upon when interacting with a deaf person. If you want a good intro to this you can find countless other resources with a tiny bit of looking.

Quick thought: Did you know about 10% of the population is deaf and about 10% of the population is left-handed? But look around and see who you know.",1463097600,3,990,4.216931216931217

7309023,5,B010CVV0BY,An excellent movie that deals with the issues of deafness and physical differences in a very easy to understand way.  My children (8-13) enjoyed it also.  The acting was true to life and well done.,1461283200,,197,4.6
7309024,5,B010CVV0BY,"I have wanted to watch this for a long time.  I was not disappointed.  Now that I know the plot, I'll watch again with more focus on the ASL for practice.",1458000000,,154,3.935483870967742

7309055,5,B010CVV0BY,"This movie is a bit silly but in a good way. It's playful, but it touches on important topics while being a nice entertaining movie. I have a deaf nephew and my family has been learning sign. This was a good way to help my own kids understand how my nephew might feel. Occasionally they've grown frustrated while practicing signs (they'd much rather just play video games than do extra learning!), but this did seem to encourage them and help with their understanding of why we learn. This isn't any sort of deep philosophical discussion. This is a film that aims to offer a glimpse into the experiences of the deaf and hard of hearing. And it does a great job of that.",1451001600,,669,4.4471544715447155
7309056,4,B010CVV0BY,"I'm a hearing person with a deaf friend that I don't see so much of. I don't know that much ASL. I wish there could be more movies like this. Liked it had a message, even though it was kind of quirky at first. I wasn't sure if I was going to continue watching it, but glad I did. Movies like this don't always have to have a message to them. Can be a normal romance, comedy or real life experiences etc. For both hearing and deaf a like, for instance  Switched at Birth (good ratings). Should be quality movie, so all will want to watch. I know a few couples where one is hearing and the other is deaf and married for long time. They have funny stories to tell. Most movies on deafy's  discourage mixed marriages, but you can't stop love. Glad I watched it.",1450483200,,757,4.142857142857143

As a hearing person who's been involved in the deaf community for over a decade, I am immediately drawn to any project that highlights deaf culture. However, this movie is no mere PSA for a social cause. The story is one to which anyone who's been underestimated, misunderstood, bullied or ostracized can relate. Beautifully crafted and uplifting but not maudlin, it acknowledges truths all too well known to deaf individuals who've been made to feel inferior, informs the uninitiated viewer of the injustices many deaf people face on a daily basis and reminds us all to look to the ""hero within"" when in need of inspiration to help us face life's challenges.

Few years ago, I learned ASL. I made improvements in my life. ASL is the key for deaf/hoh people via communication needs! Connecting and interacting with people help us to move ahead in life. No doubt about that.",1500249600,,384,4.273972602739726
