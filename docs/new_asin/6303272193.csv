I will enjoy it again & again, knowing that both of them are gone now.  It is nice to own....",1292025600,,261,4.6521739130434785
7843702,1,6303272193,"This video was a disappointment.  Here are two talented men and yet during the interview, Ustinov does not engage Pavarotti in expanding on his thoughts.  He seems to use the interactions as a way to show off his own humor.  What a waste of time and talent.  Dr. Lee",1233360000,,266,4.36734693877551
7843703,5,6303272193,"With the recent passing of Peter Ustinov, this tape has taken on added meaning.  In this one hour visit, Peter Ustinov interviews Luciano Pavarotti at Pavarotti's summer home in Italy. It is an absolutely capitivating, enchanting experience, as the two men share their thoughts and philosophies on acting, food, art, tennis, music, and life in general. At the risk of using a cliche, the two have a marvelous ""chemistry,"" and it is apparent that each has great respect and admiration for the other. The viewer is treated to glimpses of Pavarotti's performances, and of Peter Ustinov's wit and varied dialects. The kitchen scene involving Ustinov observing Pavarotti preparing dinner is worth the price of the video! The discussion of philosophy and the feeling of the two men as to the beauty of ""silence"" is an insight into the souls of these two great performers, and I cannot recommend this video enough.  I would truly love to see the program released on DVD.",1118016000,2,963,4.938271604938271
7843704,1,6303272193,"Portly Ustinov appears at the home of fatso singer Pavarotti for some witty banter among the two fat slobs.  As you might imagine, Pavarotti is not living in a men's shelter with Wonder bread bags for shoes.  He's also not living in a one bedroom house in Encino with cinderblock walls around the backyard and a large tan-colored retriever with a skin problem and a habit of incessant barking.  WHat I'm saying is he's doing plenty all right for himself and he doesn't mind if you, the viewer, find out about that.  I guess belting out opera pays a lot better than what I'm doing for a living.  I guess I don't deserve to be rich and famous with witty jet-set friends to hobnob with.  I guess the four-dollar-a-bottle merlot I get at Trader Joes is about all I deserve.",1114905600,5,769,4.457142857142857
