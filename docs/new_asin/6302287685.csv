7823611,5,6302287685,"I remember this series so vividly.  It wove celtic folk lore and legend into a wonderful mystery set in the Vale of the White Horse, where young Diana (there's some Roman mythology evoked as well) finds herself at the centre of a battle between good and evil over the fate of the Moon Stallion of the title.  It was also rather tough minded for a children's show, not dodging the fatal consequences of ambition and a nurturing of the desire for revenge.  Excellent performances made the cast of characters very vivid, both younger and older.  The BBC has a knack for these highly individual, evocative dramas - I can't believe they haven't released The Moon Stallion on DVD.  It belongs on the shelf alongside other masterpieces like The Box of Delights.",1168560000,,754,4.7251908396946565
