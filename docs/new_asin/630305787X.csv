7835865,3,630305787X,"This video had good and bad points.  One of the good points is that the video shows many images of Australia. The video also uses actual documentary footage and recreates events using documentary style, and incorperates the older footage into the modern footage. However, the video is a little slow, and the narrator has an English, not Australian, accent. The video has more of an educational then entertaining feel. I got the idea that this video may have been made for public television, and it definitly wasn't made for an American audience. If you're looking for a video to show to a class, this might be a video for you, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a travel video.",1081555200,3,693,4.634146341463414
