8125888,2,B000FS5PB6,"Les Noches Rouges/Wedding in Blood is one of Claude Chabrol's worst films from his richest period, an utterly mundane crime passionel devoid of insight or interest despite being set in the small town bourgeois milieu that had served him so well in the past and would again in the future. Chabrol has always had a tendency towards caricature, and the laughable passionate embraces between Michel Piccoli and Stephane Audran (neither at their best) or the half-dimensional corrupt mayor are indicative of the clumsiness of the whole sorry enterprise, as is the lumbering flashback setting up the murders. Things briefly threaten to get interesting after the second murder, but by then the film is nearly over and the promise remains unfulfilled.

Arrow's UK PAL DVD has an acceptable but far from outstanding transfer with optional English subtitles.",1182297600,,848,5.235294117647059
