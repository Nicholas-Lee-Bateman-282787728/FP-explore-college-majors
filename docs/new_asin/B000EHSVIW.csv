2521130,5,B000EHSVIW,"I know it... I LOVE the early UFC...

I was one of the crazy ones back in the day that really dug this stuff... now everyone loves it.

My buddies got together for this pay-per-view and were treated to some of the greatest early UFC fights.  Joe Son vs. Hackney is very memorable for the overt low blows, Hackney vs. Gracie is excellent, but the Dan Severn vs. Anthony Macias fight is outstanding.  A heavyweight wrestler vs. a lightweight kickboxer.  That is every heavyweight wrestlers dream, and my dream to see an actual German Suplex done for real to a guy.  I only saw it on video games and pro-wrestling.  I never realized it could be done legitimately TWICE!!!  The German Suplexes are worth the disk alone.

Another historic early DVD from the UFC...",1181088000,2,759,4.604477611940299
2521131,4,B000EHSVIW,"This was the debut of Dan Severn.  The man who saved the UFC.

Royce Gracie, the enormously skilled superstar who'd become the face of UFC, was growing disillusioned and wanted out.  Which was very bad news, since Ken Shamrock had becoming an absolute enigma (one withdrawal and two no-shows between 2-4) and no one else was even close to taking the mantle.

They took a big gamble on Severn, a pure amateur wrestler already well into his 30's, who had only a few days notice to get ready for UFC 4.  The deal reportedly was that he would be allowed to compete again only if he made it to the final.  If he didn't, Gracie's departure would leave UFC with no marketable stars and eventually turn it into a footnote in MMA history.

Severn's first match (which alone makes this worth watching) pitted him against a somewhat erratic yet relentless striker.  Severn takes the initiative in spectacular highlight-reel fashion and never looks back.  In the semifinal, Severn exchanges flash for cold-blooded efficiency, crushing the unprepared alternate in less than half a minute.  With his future secured, he turns his attention to the indominatble legend, Royce Gracie, producing at least one of the three best tournament finals of all time.

In between are a strange back-and-forth battle between Keith Hackney and Joe Son, Gracie against inarguably the easiest opponent of his life, Steve Jennum's (who?) unusually difficult victory over boxer Melton Bowen, and Hackney's valiant but ultimately doomed attempt to take down Gracie.  Also included is a fast and furious exhibition match (the precursor to the Superfight) between Jason Fairn and Guy Mezger.

A somewhat uneven tournament, but in the end, the sport has made its mark, and that's what matters.",1180396800,,1754,5.006896551724138

REVENGE OF THE WARRIORS

I was so happy when I learned that they were releasing the original UFC events, this one in particular because this was when Dan ""The Beast"" Severn debuted in the UFC. Dan is one of my all time favorite mixed martial arts fighters, and this one in particular was amazing.

1. ROYCE GRACIE VS RON VAN CLIEF-this fight was the typical Gracie fight in that it was a quick dominant fight. As soon as they went at each other Royce had him on the ground and tore into him until making Ron tap to a rear naked choke hold. Over all exactly what you would think happen back during the reign of the Gracie's. 5/5

2. JOE SON VS KEITH HACKNEY-this has to be one of the dirtiest, but funniest fights ever recorded on video. And I have to say that Hackney is a cold messed up dude. Joe Son basically controlled the entire bout, so Keith decided to punch Joe in the crotch repeatedly until Joe Son taped to a choke. This fight was definitely messed up on Hackney's part. 5/5

3. MELTON BOWEN VS STEVE JENNUM-this was am interesting fight, simply because Steve and Melton trade some nice blows. Even though Steve controls most of the fight at the beginning Melton still found his way back to his feet. But it seemed as soon as he got up, he was slammed right back down. And at about the five minute mark Melton tapped out to a killer arm bar. 5/5

4. DAN SEVERN VS ANTHONY MACIAS-finally we come to the last of the first round fights, and it happens to be the debut of the Beast. You can't really call this one a fight because it was over at one minute and forty five seconds. But even though it was a short bout it was still exciting, after to vicious belly to back suplexes to Anthony from Severn, Anthony tapped to a rear naked choke. 5/5

5. ROYCE GRACIE VS KEITH HACKNEY-Gracie had a harder time this time around in the second round against Hackney. In fact Hackney tore up Royce's face a little with some nice strikes. But Gracie still took the fight after applying a killer arm bar to Hackney. 5/5

6. MARCUS BOSSETT VS DAN SEVERN-apparently Steve Jennum could not continue that night so Bossett won a toss to face Severn. This was another quick fight, soon after Severn took him down Bossett tapped out. 5/5

7. JASON FAIRN VS GUY MEZGER-that's right a young Guy Mezger fought at UFC 4 in a fight before the main event of the evening. This was a great fight to view because Mezger dominated this fight, he beat this guy so bad that they threw in the towel for Fairn. 5/5

8. ROYCE GRACIE VS DAN SEVERN-this fight is definitely a classic in my mind, this was 16 minutes of two greats going at it. Sure this fight took place on the ground for most of the fight, but this was still an excellent bout. Gracie would end up winning the tournament that night but Severn proved he belonged in there with a legend. 5/5

Over all this was an excellent event, and is worth your money. Plus there is a great interview with Severn in the special features.",1170979200,7,2967,4.308797127468582
2521133,5,B000EHSVIW,"The Gracie-Severn bout may not be the most explosive bout ever, but it shows what a true Martial Artist Royce Gracie is. After watching these two go at it, with Severn seemingly having the upper hand throughout, the ending is pure Gracie: calm, quiet and effective. Royce is so methodical through this entire bout it is a blast to watch. While many of the other bouts may feature more explosive punches & kicks, this one shows that perseverance is just as important as any other element. In my opinion, this is what truly solidified Royce Gracie as a legend.

If you like the UFC and you haven't seen this one, get it!",1153785600,4,618,4.517857142857143
2521134,4,B000EHSVIW,"Tulsa, Oklahoma. 1994..

Royce Gracie is back after not being able to complete the competition at UFC 3, where he won a fight against Kimo, but became dehydrated and could not continue on to the next fight. 51-year-old Ron Van Clief takes on Royce in the first round. Royce takes him down and imposes his will on him, softening him up with elbows and punches until Van Clief opens himself up for the choke... it's a standard Royce Gracie fight.

Joe Son v. Keith Hackney. Son is freakishly religious.. almost scary. This fight is a true callback and testament to when there really were ""no rules"" in the UFC. While on the ground, Hackney punches Joe Son directly in the nuggets maybe 3-5 times... and it's completely legal.

At this UFC event, we get our first look at Dan Severn, who would later come to be nicknamed ""The Beast"". You can see that he is a wrestler, through and through.  In his fights, he manhandles his opponents, but only thinks to strike them occasionally. His fight with Royce in the finals is a 16-minute cuddling session.  He lies on top of Royce for what feels like an eternity until Royce is finally able to submit him from the bottom. Gracie is patient and composed, as always, and again it pays great dividends to his legacy in the UFC.

Before the final fight, however, there is an exhibition/qualifying match to determine which of 2 ponytailed fighters will be able to fight in the coming UFC 5.  It's Guy Metzger v. Jason Fairn. All I can recall about this fight is two ponytails flailing about for a few minutes, until the fight ends with Metzger winning, although not looking all that impressive in victory. It looked like the lead singers from Poison and Warrant got together and fought inside the octagon... Pretty funny, but entertaining.

This UFC marks the beginning of the emergence of stars other than Royce Gracie in mixed martial arts. This is a fine piece of MMA history to add to your collection.

8110311,4,B000EHSVIW,"If you're a fan of MMA, you've already heard of the Keith Hackney vs. Joe Son fight.  If you're just an interested reader, you owe it to yourself to go online and find the matchup.  After this fight is viewed, a few things are evident:
1)  In 1994, the UFC needed to institute some more safety rules
2)  Put two men in a fight, and there are no gentlemen
3)  Testicles can be punched inside of the human colon
4)  The human scrotum can only take so much punishment

Learning from UFC 3 in which multiple headliners withdrew due to fatigue/injury, this event featured three alternate bouts so that there was some fatigue on the part of those who weren't on the original card.  This change was a big step towards establishing the MMA as something more than modern day gladiators battling one another.

As with previous UFC events, the basic skills of Brazilian Gracie Jiu-Jitsu - almost secondhand knowledge for any fight fan today - were relatively unfamiliar.  Which meant Royce Gracie (champion of UFC 1 & 2) had a major upper hand in the event.  The UFC was growing, however, and the competition was greater than ever before with martial artist Guy Mezger and all-American wrestler Dan Severn among the fighters.

Other than the groin assault from the Hackney-Son fight, the length of the final between Severn and Gracie was notable.  Just as before, there were no time limits, rounds, or weight limits, and many believed Severn's combination of strength and skill would eventually wear Gracie down.  After 15+ of the most excruciating to watch ""fighting"" minutes you've ever seen, with Severn laying on top of Gracie the entire time - known today as ""Lay and Pray"" - Gracie eventually shows Severn this little known move (at that time) called a triangle choke.  End of story.  I believe this was the first step towards rounds in the UFC, with the ""Super Fight"" in UFC 5 being the straw that broke the camel's back.

Good addition for anyone's MMA library, great addition for Keith Hackney fans.",1283040000,2,1997,4.70893371757925
