2467237,5,B000CNGBXU,"T.L. Young has done a magnificent job depicting the following:

1. the history of the nudist/naturist movement in America,

2. the history of nudist/naturist film,

3. the state of the nudist/naturist movement today, and

4. humorous fictional elements that keep the viewer interested.

If you are seriously interested in the nudist/naturist lifestyle and/or are already a nudist/naturist, I strongly recommend this film.",1146182400,13,421,5.725806451612903
2467238,3,B000CNGBXU,"I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was really more of a documentary on history of nudism than anything else.  And of T.L. Young's personal experiences in a nudist club in Hawaii.  Yes, we had conversations about this way back during the college years...  Although the quality of the movie is not that of one lucky to be aired on PBS or the History channel (I think), it was a pretty fast moving, comprehensive production, with a touch of humor and an interesting plot.  Plenty of innocent nudity, from old film footages and people expressing their feelings about nudism.  It was educational and entertaining at the same time.",1146096000,5,633,4.824074074074074
2467239,1,B000CNGBXU,"Too bad I didn't read the other reviews before buying this. It doesn't really say much about naturism, but is supposed to be about one guy's attempt to make a naturist movie, interviews with potential actors, etc. It's very disconnected, and the copy I got kept repeating after scene 11, even though there was a scene 12. Bad value, in my opinion.",1143676800,22,347,4.612903225806452
2467240,4,B000CNGBXU,"To be precise, there were only two bikini models

and one does appear nude.  The others were

professional actresses who also appear nude.

Producer/director T. L. Young is a real

naturist from Hawaii, a place where nudism is the

domain of visiting tourists and very few locals. So

his experiences as a naturist is not all positive, as

reflected in the conflict scenes from his ""film"" The

Naked Place.

Because of legal issues, this documentary didn't touch

upon actual nudist documentaries sold via

Internaturally.com and other sites. This is too bad

since it would have given the filmmakers a chance to

tell the public that most nudist documentaries and

attempts to make serious films are BORING AS HELL.

They are geared toward middle-aged nudists to senior

citizens and contain music that would be antiquated in

an old folks home.

Real naturist organizations such as the Clothes Free.

com and Desert Shadows Inn make a valiant attempt to

reach the younger generation and they are prominently

featured in interviews in this documentary.  There is

more objectivity and insight in their interviews than

in their ""real"" naturist counterparts.  And as for

interviews on bikini models' and actress' skinny

dipping experiences, I doubt that others in Hollywood

have had such experiences, and if so, would not

share them on camera.",1143331200,11,1349,5.082949308755761
2467241,5,B000CNGBXU,I have had the opportunity to preview the DVD and I feel that Mr. Young has done a fine job in documenting the naturist movement in addition to one individual's introduction to naturism.  TL Young is a very talented director and producer and I do very much recommend the purchase of this DVD.,1140048000,4,292,4.509433962264151

8099736,1,B000CNGBXU,"Amateur filmakers use their own amateur films to make a point, which is irrelevant to begin with. Please don't bother: this is not serious stuff. And, sadly, it's not even funny. Or sexy. Or entertaining.",1244419200,2,204,4.857142857142857
8099737,2,B000CNGBXU,"This was a little dull.  It is a history about naturalism, but it does not have the History Channel quality for quality educational.  I would not suggest anyone buy this.",1219881600,,170,4.633333333333334
8099738,2,B000CNGBXU,"I have issues with what this movie is really about. My hunch is that the director, T.L. Young, wanted to squeeze the most money out of and promote the feature film he was making, ""The Naked Place"". And so he turned it into two films, the original and this one, a combination pseudo-documetary on the making of the first film and weak documentary on the history of nudism.

(As an advance review of ""The Naked Place"", from the outtakes shown in this ""documentary"", the acting looks really bad and the plot weak so I'm not surprised T.L. was looking for ways to save his project. I also guess this movie was initially going to be dvd ""extras"" for the feature film, but if no one buys the first film...?)

The ""making of"" aspect was a farce as you can tell the actors were, yes, acting (poorly) the roles of actors auditioning for, and then acting in, the film. An example of this is a scene with one of the main actresses and her boyfriend, both nude of course, at their home discussing whether or not she should audition for the film. Um, we're supposed to ignore the fact that this was allegedly BEFORE she decided to audition, and there is already a surreptitious cameraman in their living room that they somehow don't notice? More of the same type stuff follows with the auditions, etc.

As far as the nudism history, there wasn't anything new brought up that anyone with a brain doesn't already know. It was mostly snippets of ""nude news"" type broadcasts and some brief glances of vintage nudist films (probably from T.L.'s personal collection). I do have to say that the naturist organizations mentioned might be worth looking in to for those wanting to pursue the lifestyle.

Overall there were some nice looking nude actresses, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But again, the acting is atrocious and the movie itself disjointed.",1210723200,2,1834,4.616564417177914
8099739,4,B000CNGBXU,"This was somewhat of an impulse buy for me, but I was surprised by some of the candid moments in this, some of which were pretty humorous. Also, some of the aspiring actresses, as well as hostess Christine Nguyen, are quite easy on the eyes, especially naked! Recommended.",1209859200,,272,4.6875
8099740,1,B000CNGBXU,"This is supposed to be about true nudism.  However it's just a bunch of paid actors with a HORRIBLE script.  About 1/10 of the movie actually gets into the history of nudism, and interviews the owner of a nudist resort, but that's about it.  Everything else if not at all about nudism.  If you just want to see a couple of naked people, then go ahead and get this, but if you're actually interested in something that's truly about nudism/naturism, then don't bother with this.",1182816000,17,476,4.564705882352941

8099742,5,B000CNGBXU,"You get an inside look of what nudists feel, and stereotypes that come with it. Also there was a subplot of actors auditioning for the roles. you also get a inside look at what actors go through at auditions. A glimspe of both worlds. Kinda cool tying both

together.

Kudos to the director.",1146614400,5,291,4.471698113207547
