1276707,5,B00003CXIA,"This is the pre-quil to the first movie starring Rosi O' Donnel and Rick Morranis. It's the story of how Fred, Wilma, Barny, Betty, and even baby Dino came to meet. From there, they go to Rock Vegas(Las Vegas) and Fred hopes to earn enough money to buy Wilma a fancy wedding ring. When Fred is falsely accused of stealing, Evil Chip Rockifeller, owner of half of Rock Vegas, tries to marry Wilma. It's up to Fred to escape jail and save her before it's too late. This movie has humor the whole family will love and the acting is great. Don't miss Betty and Barny(Stephen Baldwin) who look and sound exactly like the original cartoon.

1277051,5,B00003CXIA,"While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of The Flintstones and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because its a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.

Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, hes a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so its fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie ODonnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilmas look to a T and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that cant be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Freds stepmother than Joan Collins?

Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60s cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding yes! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they arent. For instance, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? Its the same thing with both Flintstones movies  how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing?

I always loved Gazoo and hes effectively brought to life in Viva Rock Vegas. The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, its natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.

Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barneys bond. Theyre best friends and their personalities balance each other out. Youll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.

The first two acts of Viva Rock Vegas are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Dont get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesnt overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.

The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.

1277129,4,B00003CXIA,"The second real actor version movie of the popular cartoon series decided to go with actors who although you may not have heard of, actually looked like the characters in the cartoon, (well with the exception of Wilma).  The earlier 1994 film used popular at the time TV show and movie actors but other than also being a fat guy, John Goodman looked nothing like Fred, and Rick Moranis didn't remind you at all of  Barney, and since when was Betty fat? (Rosie O'Donnell).  Had never heard of actors Mark Addy or Stephen Baldwin but they certainly delivered in their roles as Fred and Barney.  Baldwin especially had Barney's expressions and gestures down pat. Jane Krakowski also closely resembled Betty and did a great job.  Wilma granted was miscast with Kristen Johnston but I guess they wanted someone for one of the four leads who audiences would have heard of.  I don't remember Wilma's mother from the cartoon but Joan Collins does a pretty good job as her as does Dharma and Greg/Criminal Mind's Thomas Gibson as the villain, after Wilma's fortune through her hand in marriage.

Yes that's one thing, this is a prequel to the cartoon and Wilma's backstory is she's a rich daughter of a wealthy family.  Again I don't remember her origins from the cartoon so didn't mind this.  The alien Gazoo is also in this one and again well represented by Alan Cumming, he wants to learn about Earth's mating rituals for humans.  This film explores the four meeting each other for the first time and being invited to Rock Vegas where Chip Rockefeller plans to manipulate Fred and show Wilma what a loser he is so she'll marry him instead.

Dino becomes Fred's pet in this one too and he is simply awesome and steals every scene he appears in.",1414713600,,1737,4.643790849673203

1277226,5,B00003CXIA,"Ever since I was a little girl, I have been a fan of The Flintstones!  The story of this movie, The Flinststones in Viva Rock Vegas, is very interesting to me because it has to do with the period of time before Fred and Wilma Flintstone got married (and before Barney and Betty Rubble also got married), something not seen on the classical T.V. series of The Flintstones from the 1960's; and in my opinion, it is a very sweet love story of how Fred and Barney meet and date Wilma and Betty, again something that was never shown on the T.V. series of The Flintstones, but it all leads to their marriages.  At the same time, the story of this movie has many of the well-known characteristics of the T.V. series, such as the appearance of Dino and the great gazoo.  I watch this movie over and over again, and I never get tired of it!  It is a great movie for everyone who loves The Flintstones and romantic stories in the movies.",1375315200,,927,4.310344827586207
1277227,5,B00003CXIA,"I love this movie. Sure it's not the cartoon but then if you're going to make a live-action of an iconic cartoon, make this one! I saw the first Flintstones movie - and being a kid from the 60s and LOVING the Flintstones for how many years now? - that movie was a disappointment, so I went into this with a reserve but it surprised me and it was incredibly closer to the characters (Well all except Kristen Johnston as Wilma BUT she's great in everything else she does).
Granted, a few things had to be changed from the cartoon's roots, but ya know it was still darn entertaining and I love watching it all over again.",1375056000,,618,4.2905982905982905

1277229,4,B00003CXIA,"IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes both give it bad reviews, by critics and users. I like that Amazon has people who know a good movie when they see one. Sure its a parallel plot to the original series, Wilma was never really an heiress that I know of and her father passed away as a kid. A few other things don't match up but as a movie this is really good. I give 5 starts for its plot and humor but as for being anything to do with the Flintsones and and the over use of Flinstones puns 3 stars. Worth watching.",1368835200,,504,4.0

In this one, we get to see Fred and Barney meet their future wives for the first time and meet the lovable, but smart alec Great Gazoo, the green alien from planet Xetox who calls Fred and Barney ""dum-dums"" like in the original series.

1277294,5,B00003CXIA,"The Flintstones In Viva Rock Vegas is a 2000 prequel to the 1994 family comedy based on the famously classic Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. British actor Mark Addy(Still Standing)as Fred Flintstone and Stephen Baldwin(Fled)as Barney Rubble when they were young and started their jobs at Slate and Co. Quarry. Kristen Johnston(The Exes)as Wilma Slaghoople and Jane Krakowski(30Rock)as Betty O'Shale when they were two of Bedrock's hottest single ladies and the objects of Fred and Barney's affection. Joan Collins(The Land of the Pharaohs)as Wilma's wealthy mom who has a pure distain for Fred and Alan Cumming(X2: X-Men United)as the Great Gazoo, an alien troublemaker who only Fred and Barney can see and also appears as British rock star Mick Jagged. The special effects were a wonder to see and special appearances by Rosie O'Donnell(the original Betty from the first film) and William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was a true treat. The special features includes a behind the scenes look of the film, a trailer of the film, and trailers of other Universal family favourites like Babe and The Little Rascals. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is perfect for any Flintstone fan, young and old. :)",1339804800,,1193,5.154639175257732

for those who do not know its a prequel to the the first first film, but it shows how Fred, and Wilma, Barney and Betty first met, very cleaver ideas. Fred would be younger so he looks younger then what we see in the cartoon or first film, but they play play the parts as you would think they would,
My only gripe was Kazoo. They really did not need to add him in, he did nothing to film to carry the story or make it better. Besides Kazoo came long after they all met. That's why its 4 stars, not 5
If you enjoyed the Flintstones as a kid, your love all over again. Rent the film for yourself. Then you can think for yourself if it is worth seeing.

1277398,5,B00003CXIA,"""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" brings the iconic 60's cartoon about the ""Modern-Day Stone-Age Family"" back to the big screen for a second run.  During it's first-run in the theatres people blasted the movie for its changes from the first movie (prequel instead of sequel, B-team cast instead of A-team cast).  However, taking a look at the movie on it's own merits you'll find an equally well-done story and rendering of America's favorite Modern-Day Stone-Age Family.
THE MOVIE:
The Story:
Again, this movie is actually a prequel to the first movie as well as cartoon.  It tells the story of how Fred and Barney first met Wilma and Betty.  Buddies and Rock-Quarry workers Fred and Barney meet Betty and Wilma and engage in a whirlwind romance.  Along the way the gang gains a pet dino (Dino) and cross paths with an exiled alien (The Great Gazoo).  Things in paradise aren't quite perfect though as Wilma's ex-beau shows up to reclaim Wilma and throw a monkey wrench into the boys' relationship with the girls.
The Cool Stuff:
It's all about the story here and effects here.  As in the first movie, Bedrock (and Rock Vegas) are beautifully rendered.  All the charm of the cartoons shines through in the film from the way Fred bowls to how he and Barney float into the air when things go right (Yabba-Dabba Doo!!!) all the way to Dino's seemingly perfectly transferred animation from the cartoon to the film.  While people lambasted this film, the storytelling is once again done very well.  The story is classic Flintstones, Fred does some dumb things to his regret landing him and Barney in trouble, Barney's lovably innocent and the girls, of course, prove they are smarter than the men.  The addition of the Great Gazoo to the film is icing on the cake.
THE DVD:
While a little sparse compared to most new release DVDs, there are some nice extras here to enhance your viewing pleasure.  Among the goodies included here are:
1. ""Making of Feature"" - 15 minute feature that talks about, among other things, the making of the Rock Vegas set, the CGI animation and the casting of the actors.
2. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.
3. Production Notes - more insight into the movie
4. Cast and Crew Bios
THE VERDICT:
Overall this movie was just nice.  It may have may have been lambasted or passed by your radar the first time around but if you are looking for a nice rental for the weekend or evening this is your film.  The storytelling is very solid and is just classic Flintstones in every respect.  In my opinion, the movie is perhaps even superior to the first movie in this respect.  All the charm of the cartoon translates perfectly is this movie.  The DVD features, while a little sparse, help make this particular DVD a nice addition to your DVD library if you are so inclined to purchase it.
Final Grades:
Movie:  5 stars

1277400,5,B00003CXIA,"I'm a big fan of Flintstones vitamins and the animated series. So I was really disappointed with the previous Flintstones live action movie. The jokes fell flat and although the casting was great (John Goodman was born to play Fred and Halle Berre in that skimpy outfit, yaba-daba-doo!), it didn't feel right. I think they tried too hard to capture the magic of the original show. You can't catch lightning in a bottle.
The beauty of ""Rock Vegas"" is, they didn't even try! This movie has Stephen Baldwin in it. He's the Baldwin they call when the other Baldwins have all thumbed their noses at the script! Mark Addy? Wasn't he one of the extras in ""A Knight's Tale"" or something? Kristen Johnson (Wilma) has the most celebrity here but she's horrendously miscast! Wilma is supposed to be this petite thing. Johnson, all 6 feet of her, with those thunder thighs and that whiskey voice...! Watch out for an appearance by a washed up, wrinkled Joan Collins!
So this movie has ""Straight To Video"" written all over it.
But somehow, it works. Don't ask me how. Somehow this cast, and the plot, and the wonderful sight gags all come together and if you suspend your belief for a moment, you'd think you were still watching the cartoon.
So if you like the Flintstones, give this a shot. Or wait til it comes on cable. And if you haven't tried Flintstones vitamins, do so. They're great and if you eat enough of them rumor has it, your urine will turn purple and green.",1043971200,16,1460,4.576335877862595

One night Fred (Mark Addy) and Barney (Stephen Baldwin) find Gazoo (Alan Cumming). Gazoo is an alien. One night Fred and Barney go to a fast food joint and meet Wilma (Kristen Johnson) and Betty (Jane Krakowski).
Fred and Barney take Wilma and Betty to a carnival as a date. Soon Wima's mother (Joan Collins) shows up at Wilma's and Betty apartment. She wants Wilma home for her father's birthday.
On the day of the party, Fred, Barney & Betty learn that Wilma is ""a poor little rich girl."" Fred is afraid if he gives Wilma is wedding ring she will laugh at him.
At the party is Chip (Thomas Gibson). And soon Chip propses a toast and Fred does too. But during Fred's toast, Fred's pet Dino shows up and makes up the party for Wilma's mother.
That might have been why Fred and his mother-inlaw never liked each other. Chip invites the four to Rock Vegas. (Rock Vegas looks like Las Vegas).
Ann-Margret does a rendition of Viva Las Vegas but the title is Viva Rock Vegas. If you like the Flintstones then here is a film you might like. Great film!",988502400,4,1304,4.348360655737705

The casting was great,Barney and Betty sound like the real cartoon characters. The special effects for Dino make him look like a real dinosaur. I don't get why people think it's so boring,it's hysterically funny. If I directed the movie I wouldn't change a thing. I think this movie is the best. If you haven't seen the movie you have no idea what you've mist.",986688000,2,476,4.3

1277406,4,B00003CXIA,"They almost pulled it off....
Jane Krakowsky is perfect as Betty....Baldwin is as good Moranis as Barney....Johnson is passable as Wilma, though Perkins is better because she's more demure...but the movie struck out on a Fred who impersonates JACKIE GLEASON throughout the movie! We all know the Flintstones are a cartoon loose adaptation of the Honeymooners...BUT------Jackie Gleason is NOT Fred Flintsone, we wanted to see Fred Flintstone not Jackie Gleason. I think the actor was capable of being Fred by being more of himself and I hope he drops the Gleason act for the next movie.
If you overlook wannabe-Gleason Fred, the movie was awesome; the Great Gazoo was incredible as a special effect and for his wit. Overall, this movie was magic on the verge of greatness, they need to fix Fred and recast Wilma and they could have a very interesting movie series. Use a wild adventure as the script and audiences will return.",971654400,,925,4.935897435897436
1277407,5,B00003CXIA,"Flintstones 2 was a really great family movie. It is a little more geared toward kids than the first, but has a more interesting story. The actors in the movie played their parts really well and were really believable in comparison to the cartoon. The scenery is excellent too including their visit to Rock Vegas. Rent it. Buy it. Just see it!!",971222400,3,344,4.564516129032258
