3936456,5,B002IGPBTY,"I have not actually seen this video, but my son (12) has watched it many times. He was excited enough about it to share it with his class, and he says usually when they watch things, the kids talk the whole time. Not so with this one. He says Bill is kind of obnoxious, but in a good and funny way, and makes the concepts interesting and easy to understand.",1274918400,4,357,4.114285714285714

8370889,5,B002IGPBTY,My kids love Bill Nye and they learn a lot from these videos.  My 6 year old (as of this writing) has watched this repeatedly since he was 4 or 5 - it taught him all about negative numbers and how to think about math.  Nye makes the information very accessible to children of all ages.,1423008000,,285,4.071428571428571

8370891,1,B002IGPBTY,"This video was a disappointment.  It was so short, and only covered 4 concepts, and covered them very superficially. A lot of the video was taken up with the theme song (EVERY time a new concept was introduced).  I wish I didn't buy it.  It was kind of useless.",1421020800,,261,4.285714285714286
8370892,3,B002IGPBTY,"The information on here is good, just not a lot of it.  Gives a good starter intro to a lesson, but that is about all, no where near as in depth as his science series.",1419292800,,167,3.7714285714285714
8370893,5,B002IGPBTY,Mostly good.,1406764800,,12,5.5
8370894,5,B002IGPBTY,helped me with the basics in math. when I needed to spruce up on the basics.  so I liked it,1367107200,,91,3.55
8370895,4,B002IGPBTY,My sons likes the games and practice pre-algebra problems that the DVD presents. I would recommend this procuct for anyone.,1357344000,,123,5.2
8370896,2,B002IGPBTY,Not the Bill Nye I and my students grew to love as Bill Nye the Science Guy!  Wouldn't recommend it.,1355097600,4,100,4.0
8370897,1,B002IGPBTY,"We love Bill Nye videos but this is not at all up to the quality we had hoped for or expected and DEFINITELY not worth the money. Is very very short-- about 10 minutes of educational content, no real teaching, and a lot of goofy little repititive slogans said over and over again.  Introduces some math concepts by name (fractions, proportions, etc) but doesn't actually teach about them at all-- skip this one!",1294012800,16,411,4.63013698630137
