7890888,5,6305536910,I do not own this tape but I watch the show on Toonami whenever I get a chance. I will most likley buy this video anyway even though I have probably seen all the episodes on it because Outlaw Star is awsome!!! It is sooo cool cause the animation is done well and it has great humor and a cool plotline. Gene Starwind and his crew of bounty hunters pilot the XGP-90 which he names the Outlaw Star. They are in search of the Galactic Layline which is said to have a mysterious highly valued treasure. Buy the video! Buy the series-it is AWSOME!!!!! I also highly recommend Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.,984009600,,601,4.280701754385965
7890889,5,6305536910,"After defeating the pirates at Blue Heaven, Gene, Jim, Melfina and Hilda escape in Horus. They're headed for Hilda's main target, a grapler ship with incredible power. They get on board it and the ship classifys the entire crew. But wouldn't you know it, the Chinese Guild attacks. Gene, Jim and Melfina help defend the new ship. While Hilda in Horus takes on the Guild. After a big battle, Hilda ends up commiting suicide to kill the Chinese Guild. After the three escape in they're new ship, Gene dubs the ship the Outlaw Star. It was pretty sad to see such a popular character in the show get killed in the fourth episode, but this volume is full of intense action. Also, you get to see your first look at Aisha ClanClan, one of the C'trl C'trl. A very fast volume with plenty of action to keep you going.",978739200,,808,4.429530201342282
