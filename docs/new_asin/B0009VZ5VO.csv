8067697,2,B0009VZ5VO,"If I were to sum up this film by Olaf Lubaszenko with just one word I'd say: mediocre. Arguably, it is equally difficult to make a truly good comedy as it is to create a serious drama. For a good comedy is just another way of depicting the reality and I'd expect it to be... well, intelligent, educated, revealing and somewhat surprising . Unfortunately, the reality of contemporary Poland, in my opinion, is not portrayed in this film much beyond old clichs and stereotypes. As a satire, therefore, this film is a complete failure. Yes, there are some fairly funny moments and I can't accuse it of completely distorting the world around but that's about it.

""Kuba, a struggling cartoonist, and Naomi, a beautiful Polish singer, fall madly in love. But her former lover, a gangster, has other plans for Naomi and for her new love."" So says the editorial description.

The plot, I guess, is good enough for a nice movie but: we don't see much of a ""creative struggle"" Kuba allegedly suffers, other than his declaration; the love affair isn't all that steamy, or romantic, if you will; Naomi - although very pretty indeed - doesn't sing any great hits, just a couple of  a so-so songs, one of them being an old, reheated, song from the Sixties. The gangster, Naomi's ex-lover, is all too predictable in his plots against the couple and so on and so on. Just about everything we see in the movie is, again, stereotypical, conventional and shallow.

I guess if one has to kill an hour and a half of time and there is nothing else to do - go watch it, otherwise I'd spent time doing something else.",1129852800,2,1594,4.562937062937063
