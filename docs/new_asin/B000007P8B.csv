1196947,1,B000007P8B,"The person who wrote the editorial review for this movie made a mistake. According to IMDB, this movie is about the following:

""In a 15th-century feudal village, a woman is accused of witchcraft and put to death. Her beautiful older daughter knows the real reason for the execution lies in the lord's sexual desire for her mother. After confronting the lord on the matter, she, too, is killed. A much younger daughter is spared and taken in by her mother's killers. Once she is of age, as a horrible, deadly plague sweeps the land, she marries the lord's worthless son. Then, during a brutal thunderstorm, the older daughter mysteriously reappears and begins to avenge her mother's death.""

This movie has nothing to do with werewolves whatsoever, as indicated in the editorial review. Its a movie about 19th century witches.",1412208000,,826,4.9352517985611515

1196949,1,B000007P8B,"This is one of my favorite films, but this Shriek Show version is the worst possible way to see Anik Borel get naked and freak out. The VHS version is the only way to see the shorter, more entertaining, and properly-framed American cut. This is one of those rare cases where less IS more. The European version tries to pretend this is a serious character study of a woman who imagines herself to be a werewolf to deal with a past sexual trauma, and it is pretty dull. The shorter, American cut realizes this is a great excuse to get a weird-looking, but somehow sexy, woman to take off her clothes and FREAK OUT like an Oscar-hopeful! Her performance is really one of the greatest things ever captured on film. The Shriek Show DVD also cuts off MUCH of the top, bottom and BOTH sides of the image. Why? Who knows? If you plan on buying a VHS copy of this, BEWARE: I bought one through Amazon and it turned out to be a bootleg that was so watery and dark, it was basically unwatchable. The Sinister version is the best DVD copy of this film that I've seen, so far. I haven't seen the Japanese DVD, but don't they still fog parts of the image they think will turn you into a werewolf? I've seen other Shriek Show DVD's that were well-done, so this is the one strike out from an otherwise pretty cool company.",1276905600,3,1306,4.313008130081301
1196950,4,B000007P8B,"Just a lot of nudity, yelling, killing, and near misses from rapists.

What we have here is a woman who is apparently the descendant of a woman who was a werewolf. She gets raped and I guess this lets her tap into her ancestery, which in turn lets her just go absolutely nuts for the rest of the movie.

No werewolf transformation, though. She is affected by the moon, but it doesn't turn her into a furball. It just turns her into a murderer. So she goes on a rampage and kills a lot until she finds love. I won't spoil things from there, but if you watch the movie you're going to know where it's going by then.

It's a great movie.

Get it in the Wicked Women three pack though. Same DVD as here, just two other freebies basically.",1180224000,2,734,4.184397163120567
1196951,4,B000007P8B,"Daniela (Annik Borel) is haunted by the rape she suffered as a child. She begins having visions of her great-grandmother dancing naked and turning into a werewolf. After watching her sister having sex w/ her husband, Daniela lures her brother-inlaw into the woods, where she goes all feral and rips his throat out w/ her teeth! Thus begins her descent into insanity and further neggidness! Daniela is put in restraints in a mental ward, until a spritely nymphomaniac gal lets her loose, only to become another victim. Once out, Daniela is picked up by a dirty old man who tries to rape her. Huge mistake! He is dealt with in grisly fashion! Next, Daniela meets a nice guy who means her no harm. This leads to the only true happiness in Daniela's life. Unfortunately, this is short-lived, as a trio of scumbags follow her home one night and... well, you can probably guess what happens. The rest is a revenge flick w/ the tattered remains of Daniela's mind reaching their final limit. I felt sorry for Daniela and hated (most of) her victims. Who wouldn't cheer her on during the junkyard vengeance scene?? I like this movie a lot, but keep granny and the small-fry far away!...",1156204800,2,1177,4.690821256038648
1196952,1,B000007P8B,"The only interesting thing about this movie is that the DVD jacket is reversible.  I had never seen that before.  This only means is that you can have two different covers of a bad movie.
This movie is about a delusional woman who thinks she's a werewolf.  There is one dream-like scene at the beginning where she transforms into a...a...a really shoddy looking werewolf.  After that nothing but a psychological case study.  I gotta tell you I fell asleep shortly after the beginning and woke to an incesant hammering.  In that half awake state I couldn't get the hammering out of my head.  I thought I was going insane.  I woke and knew the hammering was in the movie, but that I my sanity was still in question because there was still 20 minutes left.",1083888000,,753,4.525925925925926
1196953,4,B000007P8B,"This awesome Euro cult film is about Danielle (Annik Borel) who was traumatised in her youth and now, as a young woman, believes herself to be the reincarnation of a long dead werewolf ancestor. She has a phobia of men and sex, and when her sister (Dagmar Lassander) returns home from study overseas with her new husband, she kills him thus begining a decent into madness and murder.
Despite the title, the only werewolf in the film appears in the opening scene in which Danielle is having a nightmare of her ancestor (also played by Annik Borel) dancing naked then transforming before being caught by a mob of pitch-fork brandishing and torch waving villages, who burn her at the state like a witch. So if you want a standard werewolf movie, then maybe you should check out a Naschy instead, but for anyone who likes good a Euro flick or giallo then I highly recomend this one.
The film has a great cinematic style with occasional spatterings of gore and generous helpings of nudity. Annik Borel is brilliant playing the werewolf woman as she manages to look genuinely detached and vunerable then instantly snapping to a furious insane rage. In the hands of a lesser leading lady the film would probually fail.
BUYER BEWARE however. As great as this film is, this 'Shriek Show' DVD version maybe uncut but is however incorrectly framed and missing picture information on all sides. There is a much better R2 Japanese DVD out there (which I own) but it is more expensive and requires region free equipment.
Overall a 5-star film with a poor 1-star DVD presentation.",1067385600,16,1565,4.736263736263736
1196954,2,B000007P8B,"It talks about the werewolf, but there is only one scene, which a woman became a wolf at the beginning of the film. I thought that this film is the werewolf movie when I saw the title of this film, but there is no werewolf woman. There is only insane woman who kills people ridiculously. The woman kills people because her ancestor, who was a werewolf, appears and manipulates her to kill people. In addition, she has a memory that she was raped when she was young. After that, she has a terror about the male and also has a disgusting feeling about sex. So, she kills people when they have sex or they are related to sexual actions. The scenes of murder are crude, and bombastic performance as well. I think that this film is trying to explain the poor insane woman why she killed people. However, it is not convincing. On the contrary, it goes to the crudeness.",1021766400,6,863,4.4
7905205,4,B000007P8B,"Warning SPOILERS!!! Even though this has the title of a horror film, this is actually a tense Italian psychological thriller. Daniela Neseri (Annik Borel; PRISON GIRLS - 1972) is a very troubled woman. The film opens with Daniela having a nightmare where she is stark naked and dancing wildly to some voodoo music inside a circle of fire. She dances like she is reaching a climax and when that occurs, she is writhing on the ground. When she turns over, she looks like a wolf woman. She hears some townspeople off in the distance who are looking for a werewolf. They are carrying torches and getting closer. When one man gets too close, she attacks him, biting him on the neck and cleaving his face in two with a hatchet (a really gory effect). She wakes up screaming in terror, unable to talk, and her rich industrialist father, Count Neseri (Tino Carraro; THE CAT O'NINE TAILS - 1971) comes running into her bedroom. He notices a small photo of a female ancestor on her bed, a woman who lived in the ""Forest of Sales"" who, legend has it, turned into a werewolf during a full moon. The Count reveals to Daniela's psychiatrist (Elio Zamuto; VIOLENT NAPLES - 1976) that she hasn't been herself ever since she was raped when she was a teenager and that he moved into the family mansion in hopes that a change of scenery would make her feel better, but she has become obsessed with her ancestor since she found the photo in the attic.
  The arrival of Daniela's sister Elena (Dagmar Lassander; THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY - 1981) and her new husband Fabian (Vito Domenighini) stirs something deep inside Daniela. She has a deep-seated hatred for her sister and Fabian looks just like the man whose face she cleaved in half in her nightmares. She daydreams that she is naked and making love to Fabian, but she has more pressing problems. She thinks she hears her ancestor calling to her, saying, ""You belong to us!"" (and a large lizard crawls up her body, resting between her breasts!). Is all this in her head?
  That night, while peeping through the bedroom door, Daniela spies on Elena making love to Fabian, masturbating while moaning. Fabian hears her and gets up to investigate, walking outside (it is a full moon), where Daniela his waiting for him, nude for all the world to see. They begin to make love, but something stirs within Daniela, causing her to kill Fabian by biting him on the neck and tossing his dead body down a ravine. Daniela thinks she is a wolf woman, but is she? The next time we see Daniela, she has been committed to a mental asylum in a catatonic state. Her psychiatrist tells another doctor that if she has another attack, rather than pumping her full of drugs, they should restrain her. Elena comes to visit her sister and Daniela tells her that she saw her making love to Fabian and then yells out, ""You whore! Go **** yourself, you dirty bitch!"", forcing the orderlies to tie her to the bed. This doesn't sit too well with Daniela and that night a female nymphomaniac patient sneaks into her room, unties Daniela and starts kissing her naked body (!) Daniela kills her with a knife she had hidden under her body (where did she get it?) and escapes the institution by hiding in the backseat of a car driven by a female doctor (Felicita Fanny; THE BIG BUST-OUT - 1972). The doctor sees her and crashes the car. The doctor is in serious condition, but alive, and Daniela escapes, walking down the road. She spots a peasant girl making love to a man in a barn, getting turned-on in the process. In case you haven't guessed by now, sex equals death to Daniela, so when the man leaves, Daniela kills the young woman by biting her neck and breasts.
  The police are called in when the bodies start piling up and Inspector Modica (Frederick Stafford; Hitchcock's TOPAZ - 1969) and his partner Arrighi (Andrea Scotti; THE KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS - 1974) go to see the Count when they notice the wounds on the peasant girl bear a striking resemblance to the wounds on Fabian's body. The Count tells them that Daniela is very sick and that he has no idea where she is. Elena overhears the conversation and now realizes that her sister killed Fabian (she originally thought he was killed by a pack of wild dogs). Meanwhile, Daniela hitches a ride with a dirty old man that can't keep his hand off her thigh. The next time we see her (we are made to think she killed the old man), she is living in the house of a young man named Luca Mondini (Howard Ross; 5 DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON - 1970). He is a movie stuntman and treats Daniela like all women want to be treated: Like a human being. They fall in love and a month passes without any incidents (There is a scene where she shoots Luca with a pistol and he falls off a building, but it is revealed that it is just a stunt he is performing for a movie!). She calls her worried father and tells him not to worry, she's in love, but will this love last or will there be more deaths in the future?
  Daniela can't seem to catch a break as, while Luca is at work, a trio of rapists break into the house and sexually assault her. When Luca comes home, the rapists are waiting for him. A fight ensues and Luca is killed when one of the rapists stabs him in the stomach with a switchblade (it's the way he stabs him which makes this scene stand out). Daniela then goes on a murder spree, killing two of her rapists in an auto junkyard. She kills the third one (the one who killed Luca) by burning him alive. Inspector Modica and Arrighi put two and two together and the chase is on. Will they capture Daniela before she kills anyone else? The answer is found in the Forest of Sales, the same location where her ancestor was killed (There is also an epilogue where a narrator explains that Elena died in an insane asylum and the Count committed suicide!).
  This atmospheric thriller (originally titled LA LUPA MANNARA [""The Wolf Woman""), directed and written by Rino Di Silvestro (WOMEN IN CELL BLOCK 7 - 1973; DEPORTED WOMEN OF THE SS SPECIAL SECTION - 1976), is less about horror and more about a woman's fragile psyche. The nudity and sex in this film almost reach pornographic levels, as Silvestro has a habit of showing Daniela's private parts in extreme close-up, something not acceptable in films of this type back in the '70s and even up to this day in the United States. If you have seen the U.S. theatrical version, titled THE LEGEND OF THE WOLF WOMAN (distributed by Dimension Pictures, on VHS from VCI Video & United Home Video and on fullscreen DVD from Full Moon as part of their ""Full Moon's Grindhouse Collection""), be aware that this version is missing over ten minutes of footage, most of it extreme nudity & sex and graphic gory violence (Silvestro is listed as ""R.D. Silver"" on the prints of this cut). This film would not have worked if not for the exceptional, brave performance of Annik Borel, who exposes her soul (and so much more!) for all of us to see. She is simply fantastic. Frederick Stafford died a tragic death in 1979 at the age of 51 when a plane he was traveling in crashed into another plane mid-flight over Lugano, Switzerland. The DVD & Blu-Ray, from Raro Video, is the only way to watch this film. It is uncut and in widescreen, with the option to watch it in Italian with English subtitles or English dubbed. When I have this choice, I always go for the original language, even though it is obvious Stafford and other actors were speaking English. The disc also contains a 2008 interview with Silvestro (he passed away in 2009), who is very passionate about this film (he calls it a ""tragic, terrifying pathology""). This was his first film where he had complete control and he is proud of it. You will be, too. It's not pretty, but life is not pretty, is it? Also known as TERROR OF THE SHE WOLF. Also starring Osvaldo Ruggieri, Isabella Rosa, Maria Renata Franco and Salvatore Billa, Willy Pepe & Pietro Torrisi as the rapists. A Raro Video DVD & Blu-Ray Release.

7905210,5,B000007P8B,"I just bought this elsewhere to replace my old shriek show release, and it's now so much more enjoyable. The title of this film reflects the behavior and condition of a severely insane lady who kills like an animal. She doesn't transform into a werewolf, although she is plagued by dreams of her transforming into a wolf woman. The film starts quickly and immediately displays full nudity with Borel. This is followed with her becoming a kind of sleazy looking werewolf in which she wields a hatchet and smacks it into someone's head. This whole beginning sequence is revealed to be a dream, and she isn't really a werewolf; although she's a complete mental case, and her performance as this insane woman is great. She soon has a couple more delusions when she's alone and awake. This leads back to the delusion that she's a werewolf, which then results in her biting a guy to death while she's completely nude and tossing him over a cliff. Later, she meets a guy and finds true love, so it becomes sort of a love drama for a brief amount of time. However, the film's tone then switches again as it becomes a short I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE rape and revenge clone. I liked the way the film's tone changes as it combines all this stuff in one film; it's a ton of fun and sleaze with a lot of stuff in one movie. There's plenty of full frontal nudity in the film, and Annik Borel looks great. The body count is good, it has a good amount of gore, and the sleaze factor is high. It has good scenery and directing, and it has some good atmosphere with the night sequences. I thought the pace was also good, as well as the soundtracks. It's a great classic if you like 70s grindhouse sleaze. If your a mainstream horror fan, you might still really like it as long as you're aware of what you're getting into when you buy it.

My DVD came with a slip cover and a little booklet. However, some may not come with the slipcover because RARO VIDEO now says that this Blu-ray doesn't have one; maybe they'll make a later batch with the slipcovers again. The blu-ray quality is great, and it fixes the improper framing problem that was on the old Shriek Show DVD. The menu screen has animation, and the director's interview is really good.

A mentally unstable young woman named Daniela (Annik Borel) fantasizes that she is the reincarnation of her long-dead ancestor, a woman thought to have been a werewolf.
