2835189,4,B000QCU9WQ,"As an Australian fan I am aware we are way behind in the series but the minute this came out I grabbed it. It's fun to watch as always, the fighters who arrive at the end fight like true UFC fighters so the process once again brings to the fore some great talent. Unfortunately the challanges are no longer part of the format but it's well edited and enjoyable. Tito really steps up and leaves Shamrock behind in his commitment to the training and his team which is a surprise. You'll get your money's worth.",1190505600,,508,4.3578947368421055
2835190,4,B000QCU9WQ,"Tito vs Shamrock is a bit tired. It was ""fresh"" in 99, but seems to be way played out by the time the filming of Season 3 of TUF rolled around. Nevertheless, ratings went through the roof and casual fans were drawn in by the recognizable names of the coaches, even if they are both past their primes. The trash talking is all there, if not staged. Tito Ortiz has always played the bad guy, but comes off as a concerned and dedicated coach to his team during the six weeks they trained. On the other hand, Ken Wayne Shamrock, Lion's Den leader, Pancrase Legend, UFC original and WWE star shows us that he could really care less about his boys. He does seem concerned with their physiques though as he brings in a bodybuilder as an assistant. He likes his days off to regroup as well. What exaclty were they learning in the Lion's Den all those years? And perhaps, this is why they no longer are relevant....TUF Season 3 unleashes some new stars on the masses like Michael Bisping, Ed Herman and Kendall Grove. Plenty of exciting fights to entertain you for hours. Plus you can fast forward through all the Shamrock nonsense.",1185148800,5,1123,4.482926829268293
2835215,4,B000QCU9WQ,Better fights than last season. Some fighters sucks but there is some really interesting rising fighters to watch.,1236816000,,114,5.388888888888889
2835216,3,B000QCU9WQ,"I use to not like Tito Ortiz, but after watching these DVDS,I realized that he is an honorable person and one hell of a coach.",1227398400,,126,4.08
2835217,5,B000QCU9WQ,"If you're a fan of the UFC.. I highly recommend getting it.

I wish they had an option on the CD's to watch the TV version.  I have kids that like to watch this too, but with all the swearing I will not allow them to watch it till they get older.",1227225600,2,246,3.7115384615384617
2835218,2,B000QCU9WQ,I was pretty dissapointed with this season. The fights were pretty boring in my opinion.  I was hoping Ken and Tito's hate for each other would make it interesting.  Nothing major happened between them. Shamrock showed that he had no clue in what he was doing as a coach.  Season 3 did produce some alright fighters though.,1226880000,,323,4.631578947368421
2835219,5,B000QCU9WQ,"TUF is a unique house-bound reality show: There's no wussy voting of house members out. Instead they fight each other and the loser goes home. Fans of TUF will savour this instalment.

TUF Season 3 delivers what it promises: a great grudge match between Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock. The grudge is played out initially through the contest between their respective teams of fighters. Other reviewers thought this season was lacklustre, but it's better than TUF Seasons 1 and 2. The artifice of team event competitions has been dispensed with, and the focus is simply on the fighters - their training, fights, and in-house antics. Ken Shamrock shows himself to be a clueless coach, while Tito Ortiz displays some real leadership by giving coherence and focus to his team. Tito's care and attention to the needs of his deaf team member is touching. TUF3 was followed by a UFC fight - not included in this set - in which Tito beat Ken senseless with elbow strikes.

Even if you are not a mixed-martial arts fan, buy this set now to see one of the better reality shows.",1204416000,,1063,4.679144385026738
2835220,4,B000QCU9WQ,they fixed issues from first seasons.  no more stupid challenges & now everyone must fight each round.  i HATE tito normally but you have to love him in this.  he's an outstanding coach & cornerman.,1202169600,,198,4.6
2835221,5,B000QCU9WQ,"Okay, so when my husband borrowed this series from a friend and I came home to him watching it, I wrinkled up my nose in disdain and said, ""Do we really have to watch this?"".  Ten minutes later I was enthralled with the show; with the rivalry between Ken ""The Shamrock"" and Tito Ortiz; the drama of the housemates; and the athleticism of the fighters.  Next thing I know, I am asking to watch mutliple episodes a night and of course, now we own all 4 seasons, anxiously awaiting 5 and 6 to come out.  Who would of thought?",1198627200,,522,4.252525252525253
2835222,4,B000QCU9WQ,I love this show.  I will reget the dvd set.  Its Just too bad two set season 3 and season 2 both had skips in them.,1194825600,,116,3.423076923076923
2835223,4,B000QCU9WQ,"pretty darn good series. shamrock was an idiot and it really seemed like all his fighters resented him, while tito really surprised me at how he conducted himself.

im glad a few of the fighters left or got pounded out (grove's team dagger partner..fogot his name) both during the show and during fight nite...that was great!

cant wait for the other season to come out as well!",1194307200,,378,4.626865671641791
2835224,5,B000QCU9WQ,"Hey, do you like The UFC? Then you just might like this! And I've got the first two seasons to catch up with when Forrest Griffin and Rashad Evans were the names to watch. It consists of two coaches, and it this case, they are nothing shy of bitter rivals. These two bitter rivals, Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock, have exactly what the title of this suggests, ""The Ultimate Grudge!!"" Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock pick 2 teams, middleweights and light heavyweights. There are two UFC contracts on the line.

I'm going to say that I easily had my favorites. And not all of them made it to the finale. In saying that, there are a couple of shockers, a couple of them highly disappointing. But the positive highly outweighs the negative in this. If there is one thing I'm going to spoil as far as the whole series goes, I will say this: I gained a totally new height of respect for Tito Ortiz! I've never seen a man more concerned for the condition of his men going into battle. And for the record, I don't think it was just some act for the cameras. That man was there to train his men, and he wanted not just to win one fight, he wanted to win 'em all!! On the other hand, the side you think you might see of Shamrock, (besides being pissed off and not trusting Tito) it didn't impress me. Matter of fact, if anybody did some stuff for the cameras, it was Ken, and that shocked me.

In the beginning, I gained instant respect for the likes of Michael Bisping, Matt Hamill, especially with him being deaf, Kalib Starnes, Rory Singer (YEAH, likes and dislikes. I still liked the dude. DEAL WITH IT!!) and Kendall Grove. While in the middle of it, Josh Haynes would win me over with his ""NEVER QUIT!!"" attitude, especially being a family man. Jesse Forbes and Tait Fletcher would kind of stick in my mind as ones who were there just to be there. Ed Herman would simply impress me when it was all said and done.

In the end, you can certainly expect your differences. Rivals collide head on at times! Two Team Quest Members are part of this cast. You even have your alliance with a ""TEAM DAGGER!!!"" Hey, one shines at The Ultimate Fighter 3 Finale, while the other gets knocked out on the show, and on the Finale by Luigi Fioravanti on the Undercard. You might say there is total domination, and you can give the credit to Tito Ortiz. Darn good fighters the whole way around. Hey, if the whole ""Ken/Tito"" feud annoys you, it isn't all about Ken and Tito! This is about 16 fighters, and who wants it more. The Finale Main Events give you 2 great battles, as well as a couple of surprises! Kenny Florian and Sam Stout finish the night off with a pretty quick ending.

Don't just blow this off! It has some good stuff!",1193011200,,2705,4.339920948616601
8195573,5,B000QCU9WQ,"This was a pretty good season. I guess Tito Ortiz isn't that mean of a person, he's pretty nice from what I saw of him on this season.",1493942400,,134,3.8214285714285716

8195577,5,B000QCU9WQ,Its always fun to see two guys interacting with each other who hate one another.  Ortiz-Shamrock is one of the best rivalries in UFC history.  Great to see them interacting on a day to day basis.,1431216000,,195,4.388888888888889
8195578,5,B000QCU9WQ,Classic!,1414195200,,8,8.0
8195579,4,B000QCU9WQ,"One of the highest rated seasons in history because of the rivalry between Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock, and it also went a different way most of us expected. Before the show, Tito was seen as the cocky and arrogant fighter who was one of the most hated MMA figures at the time, while Shamrock was one of the original UFC fighters, well respected by peers and fans and also regarded as a great coach, responsable for the Lion's Den camp, one of the most succesful training camps in the early days of MMA. However, at least in this show, Ken acted careless at his fighters and even feuded with some of them, while we got to see the other side of Tito Ortiz that we never got to see before this show, the hard worker fighter and a guy who was legit worried about his fighters, specially when hiring a translator for the deaf Matt Hamill, pushed his fighters to the limit and made a better work as a coach than Shamrock. Plus also Ortiz got the best of Ken for the whole season, just smiling was enough to make Shammy lose his cool.

Also the season had very it's fair share of talented fighters, like current middleweight contender and future TUF coach Michael Bisping, Matt Hamill, Kendall Grove and Ed Herman, the last 2 involved in one of the best TUF fights in history at the finals. Plus one of the most infamous moments in TUF history when Noah Inhofer decided to quit the show after getting a package in which his 6 month girlfriend thought he was cheating on her and Dana refused to let him make a phone call.",1353888000,,1514,4.34982332155477
8195580,5,B000QCU9WQ,The season is the best of all I have ever seen. The rivalry between the players/coaches is outstanding. I recommend this to any UFC fan out there for sure.,1352419200,,155,4.379310344827586
8195581,4,B000QCU9WQ,This ultimate fighter was great. It had it all!!! Each DVD worked without any problems.,1288656000,,87,4.866666666666666
8195582,5,B000QCU9WQ,"My boyfriends addicted. He didn't have any of the Ultimate Fighters before I bought these, but he loved watching them on TV. He's a guy, they can watch fights over & over & over, it doesn't get old.  I purchased season 1 thru 4 & will be getting the rest, very soon!",1271289600,,266,4.115384615384615
