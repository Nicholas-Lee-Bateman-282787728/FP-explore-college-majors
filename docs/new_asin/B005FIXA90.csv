4678986,5,B005FIXA90,well this season of degrassi as with most is more intense than the other prior season. iv been watching it since 7th grade im currently 3 yrs out of hs and yet still enjoy it,1283731200,,174,4.0
4678987,5,B005FIXA90,"This season featured many entertaining storylines, and the movie was fantastic. Definately a worthwhile purchase.",1282176000,,113,6.6
4678988,5,B005FIXA90,"This product is AWESOME!! It came with all four DVDs. Also, it works perfectly fine! There was a fresh new smell when I opened it. I would order from this person again.",1281916800,,168,4.28125
4678989,4,B005FIXA90,"I'm going to review the product/dvd set more than the actual season...

Picture Quality:

One of the most exciting aspect of this dvd set is that it is finally in 16:9 widescreen! For the first time, a Degrassi DVD set is in widescreen. The picture quality is pretty decent as well. It's a lot cleaner than the previous grainy seasons. It's not blu-ray quality, but it looks pretty good for a DVD set.

Packaging:

WHY!?!?!?! Why did they do this!?!? They decided to STOP doing the box sets format with little mini dvd cases! Now they decided to package the set in a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, CHEAP 4 disc dvd case. This dvd case is the same size as the standard dvd case. However, it is made with very, very, cheap plastic. Poor quality, China made, 4 disc dvd case. The case is so bad, that it will most likely snap in half if you accidentally step on it.

Extras:

This DVD set contains the Degrassi Takes Manhattan movie! It's also in widescreen, which is nice because TeenNick only showed it in 4:3 fullscreen. There's also deleted scenes and bloopers for both the season and the movie. One of the discs also contains ""minis"". They are short episodes that are like 5 minutes long each that give the whole season some depth. They are pretty funny too. There is also 3 music videos from the Degrassi movie. Overall, the extras are pretty nice.

Overall:

I felt with the deleted scenes, minis, and widescreen presentation it was a step forward, with the terrible packaging that was a HUGE step backwards, and lack of subtitles for everything is an annoy step sideways. But overall I felt this season of Degrassi was more entertaining than season 8.",1279929600,11,1645,4.590443686006826
4678990,3,B005FIXA90,"Bad: For the NINTH season in a row-NO subtitles or even close captions.

Good: WIDESCREEN ALL season LONG!",1279584000,3,106,4.888888888888889
4678991,5,B005FIXA90,"After a shaky season 8 where many of the episodes were forgettable (though still a solid season), Degrassi gets back on form with season 9. Introducing new characters like twins Declan and Fiona, nice-girl Jenna and class clown Dave, and a whole lot of drama, the show takes it to a whole new level. Foundations of seemingly strong relationships are rocked as infidelity plays a big part this season, along with drugs, first times and homosexuality. A strong cast of talented teenagers take centre stage and shine, proving they can handle difficult storylines. Characters also have to handle a lot this year: Holly J softens in light of a new relationship, Riley continues his inner battle with who he is and what he wants, Anya makes a bad decision out of desperation to save her relationship with Sav, and Ally learns a hard lesson about honesty. This season has shocks, humour, fun, and heart. Anyone who claims Degrassi has 'Jumped the Shark' just has to watch this season to see the show is still going strong.",1277856000,16,1015,4.7727272727272725
4678992,5,B005FIXA90,"In the 9th season of Degrassi, everyone's favorite Canadian soap ""goes there"" like never before. Watch reformed bad boy Peter Stone as he deals with an addiction to crystal meth, the loss of his lovely girlfriend Mia to another continent (*cough* Vampire Diaries *cough*), and the tough decision that his bandmates are forced to make when he goes too far. Watch Riley struggle with his inner feelings and his contrasting jock exterior. Watch Jane toy around with a new relationship, find a friend in an unsuspecting classmate, and pick up a new hobby. Watch the world's most dramatic couple, Sav and Anya, fall in and out...and in and out...and in and out of love again. Watch as little Clare begins to grow into her own, and Alli is as bold as ever. Watch as Holly J, the most hated girl in school, earns both a fresh start and the heart of Degrassi's hottest diplomat kid, Declan Coyne. Watch as alumni favorite Emma Nelson struggles to balance college dreams and her love for helping humankind, and familiar face Marco gains a new role at his alma mater. But most of all, watch as a superb cast of young adults continues to carry the name of Degressi high and proud, never balking to discuss the difficult issues such as homosexuality, drug abuse, religion, and infidelity. This is one of the best seasons in the nine years that Degrassi has been on television, and should you choose to purchase this DVD set, you will not be disappointed.",1275264000,9,1442,4.681102362204724
4678993,5,B005FIXA90,"This Season of degrassi was so intense and so much better then the other season's and this season was really good because of The dot exploding, and plus Emma and Spinner finding their love together was good too and also some nude involved and a trip to new york in the season final. My favorite part of this season was the movie because it was so much fun to see drama in new york and also the movie was good but kinda unexpected because this was the final season with the four original characters that started the show which are Emma, Manny, Spinner, and Liberty even though Liberty wasn't part of this season, she was in the movie final and it was great to finally close their ending in the show plus Fiona and Declan might do something unexpected too, Anyway this season rocked and I can't wait to see more of Degrassi on my TV.",1274572800,4,831,4.333333333333333

4679131,5,B005FIXA90,"I love how serious this show gets. It truly shows the things high school students face on a daily basis.
What I love more is they are unwavering in telling the stories, and don't apologize.
Boiling Point was especially dramatic, as the name suggests. However, it still remained honest.
The characters are amazing. The writers of this show truly know how to show the different dimensions of a person. They show you a real struggle between nature and nurture in a lot of circumstances. They also show you that people can change, which I find beautiful.",1408492800,,550,4.739583333333333

Amazon has messed up the episodes, we are missing a few, and missing the end of the season movie--which leaves me without a clue at times for the next season. If Amazon could fix that issue, I would give it 5 stars.",1407456000,,458,4.157303370786517

Actually compared to a teen show, Beverly Hills 90210, that I watched as a young 20 something it has Much better acting...and characters that feel ""real"".  I loved it from the first season with Emma, Jimmy etc. this season is my least favorite so far though. I do not care for the new character Declan that was introduced this season but it's not because of his acting...I just don't like the rich guy persona. Give me a Shawn or Craig over him any day.",1404086400,,587,4.1946902654867255

4679257,5,B005FIXA90,I liked the show and most of the characters. I find them funny for being dumb in easy situations. Only I didn't like was why are so many episodes focused on Claire and Eli? Both of their characters are boring and annoying.,1377648000,,222,4.309523809523809

4679261,1,B005FIXA90,"I love DegrassiTNG. It's by far one of my all-time favorite shows, and I was excited to finally be able to purchase the seasons I don't already own - including Season 9.

First off, the DVD case clearly states there should be four discs - there is two. One with every episode listed, and one DVD that doesn't have ANYTHING on it, and which says ""Disc Four"". So, no special features or Degrassi Takes Manhattan whatsoever.

If you can get over the fact that the DVD set itself is horrific, you're still completely screwed. The quality of the episodes is horrible and looks like it was recorded with a VHS off an old television.

I'm extremely dissatisfied with the product and find it a shame that I've waited this long to buy what I think is a total piece of s*** deal. I plan on letting Amazon know to see if I can get a workable, quality product.",1364688000,4,848,4.3544303797468356

The packaging for the set even has a list of what's supposed to be on each disc. I was upset and put the discs into my dvd player, the first disc has every single episode of season 9, don't get me wrong, however it's on the one disc and the one disc alone. There are no special features for the season. The final disc ,which is supposed to have the degrassi feature movie as well as special features for the movie, has those things and even says disc four on it. I'm unsatisfied and if I had known I wasn't going to get all the features I wouldn't have purchased the item.",1364256000,,685,4.044117647058823

I don't know if that is because the distributor has changed or they just didn't have as much material to add to the DVD.  Either way it was a little disappointing in that aspect.,1310342400,,350,4.3538461538461535
4679299,5,B005FIXA90,Been watching Degrassi since I was 14 and it is a soap for teens.  Deals with real teen issues in the way a teen would handle them.  Whether they be right or wrong.  No subject is left untouched.  Its great for kids 13 and up in my opinion.,1299456000,,240,3.9375
