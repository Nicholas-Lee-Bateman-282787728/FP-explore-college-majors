2012911,5,B0001LYESC,"This is quite simply one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. By no means is it a good movie. It's a good movie to watch but only because it is so horrible. The dialogue, the production values, the acting, the music, the editing, you name it and it will make you laugh.

Joe ""Samurai"" Marshall is our main character. He's the martial arts using, fluent japanese speaker bushido warrior cop who is going to take down the Katana Gang. This guy sports one of the sweetest mullets you've ever seen and also spouts out some of the sleaziest/cheesiest lines you've ever heard. He also doesn't speak japanese a single time yet they say that he is fluent in it. Between him his partner and a very... promiscuous helicopter pilot they take the katana gang on.

  I could go on and on... and on about this movie. Joe Marshall's big speech in the restaurant is so intense it's hilarious but if I keep going on then I won't leave much for the viewer to see for themselves. The commentary for the movie is also hilarious but the true experience for watching this movie is to see it in a big group. There is just so much to make fun of and you gotta do it with a few other people.

Definitely recommended and place it on your piano.",1122076800,41,1226,4.3130434782608695
2012912,5,B0001LYESC,"Sure to be a cult  classic here in the states as it was in Europe. There's plenty of action and full breasted babes in action to keep you interested when the dialogue gets you laughing. Not to mention a mullet here or there. So, you may want to see it with Joe Bob's commentary on. A group of friends and I laughed our asses off to his comments. I guess there's no chance for a sequel since most of the cool characters die by hara-kiri, beheading, death by sword, fire or get shot off a roof. But our hero and his partner could always return..if there not in convalescent home by now. If you can't get your hands on the DVD don't despair, this film will surely show up on, ""Dinner and a movie"", or ""Mystery Science 3000"". weird blonde gangster",1087084800,6,743,4.2695035460992905

2012921,5,B0001LYESC,"After years of suffering through the Joe Bob Briggs version that was Pan & Scan they finally released Samurai Cop in it's full glory as it should have been released all those years ago.

We get the titular Samurai Cop, played by the lion maned Mathew Karedas. Well lion maned in some scenes. It seems that Mathew cut his hair after they finished principal shooting but was called back for reshots and instead of waiting for his hair to grow back in, they just put a woman's wig on his head. Usually when he's wearing a baseball cap and pushing the hair out of his face, it's a wig.

The story itself is all sorts of amazing 80's cheese. From Mark Frazer as the buddy cop and his amused expressions, to the inimitable Robert Z'Dar as one of the henchmen the cast is just golden. They're not great actors, but they deliver their performances with such passion that it's impossible not to get sucked into the story.

The fight scenes are terribly done. The dialogue in many cases is second rate. And the less said of Mathew in his mankini the better. But the highlight has to be the final sword fight between Robert Z'Dar and Mathew. Neither one could convincingly swing a sword so they just sped up the scene. In one scene Mathew's wig and hat go flying off before magically reappearing on his head.

If you're a lover of bad movies you really need to see this one in all it's glory.",1471910400,8,1381,4.403921568627451

2012924,5,B0001LYESC,"Samurai Cop is a potent farrago of crime, justice, violence, sex, hair, cops, cars, and the hours between 6 AM and 8 PM.  What appears at first glance to be an amateurish, cheap, soulless exercise in cargo cult action movie making quickly becomes obvious as a COMPLETELY amateurish, cheap, soulless exercise in cargo cult action movie making.

Nonetheless, there is an effervescent spirit to Samurai Cop that buoys the viewer, sweeping them along with its rambling, incoherent attempts at comedy, social commentary, and storytelling.  This loud, blank-eyed mess provides more entertainment in its blind struggle with itself than many of the coherent, professionally made films it shamelessly (yet, somehow, innocently) rips off.

2012930,4,B0001LYESC,"I saw the 2nd film first, wasn't quite sure what to expect, but also heard a ton of internet buzz about this B-Movie Series.
I love cheesy films, or ones with crazy backstories ala The Room.

This first film is way more serious than the second, but has some goofy stuff going on none the less. Strange action sequences, sped up action, the main lead wearing a wig for about half the film due to thinking the shooting had ceased and much more. I suggest you watch the interviews online and extras on both this film and it's sequel.

I thought the quality of the Picture and Sound was great and the main actors worked very well off one another. Not to mention the recently deceased Robert Z'dar (Rest in peace Boo Boo).

If you are having a B-movie/cheesy movie kind of night, check out both films. They feel different than one another, and the second is way more self aware of it's cheese. But I enjoyed them both enough to buy them on Blu-Ray. Great stuff!",1456876800,,956,4.389830508474576

2012941,5,B0001LYESC,"Samurai Cop is a fantastic ""so bad it's good"" movie. It suffers from the ""over sexualization"" that many bad movies suffer from, but it isn't bad. It's laughable, mostly. The movie was clearly an attempt to make an ""American"" action movie, but failing to understand the basics of characterization. Because of the ineptitude of the director, many elements come together perfectly to make a great ""so bad it's good"" movie. At some times the main character is obviously wearing a wig and doesn't do a good line read. At other times the plot just seems to wander around until they remember what they're supposed to be doing.

I highly recommend it if you're a fan of those types of bad movies.",1441065600,2,688,4.68595041322314

2012989,5,B0001LYESC,"As the newest movie that Media Blasters served up in their series of Joe Bob Briggs supplemented titles, ""Samurai Cop"" may be the perfect candidate for Drive-In Criticism. The movie is abominably bad with tons of gaffs, horrible acting, embarrassing fashion, porno actresses, flaccid action scenes and woeful attempts at humor. In Joe Bob's hands, he crafts an alternately hilarious and informative commentary that grabs seemingly every bit of minutia available about this movie.

What puts this release over the top is that this movie is fun to watch without the commentary! Yes, I prefer the accompaniment of Joe Bob, but without him the movie survives on its own flabbergasting badness and is wonderfully entertaining.

There are other extras on the disc, but I can't say I've looked at much of them. Joe Bob Briggs is worth the price by himself; everything else is all bonus points in my opinion.",1408147200,3,900,4.993333333333333

I honestly though troll 2 would be the movie that produced laughs for years but this honestly is an amazing film.  Sometimes a film can do every possible thing wrong and it makes the film better by failures at each spot.  We have ex porn stars for women here and a lead actor that was found maybe at chippendales although his obituary reads he worked for a union.  You'll find yourself watching this fill numerous times and you won't know why.  You'll be showing the film to the skeptical people that keep telling you ""I don't like bad movies.""  Let's realize something.  Entertainment can come at the expense of art and in this case that is exactly what happens.  The plot is atrocious, the acting even worse, the sound is awful, the filming stinks, they seem to have no idea what they are doing and it looks like porn at times with the dialogue.  I am anxious to see how this director could top this.  This really seems to have used up every laugh but who knows?  Soooo good though.  I play this with Ninja 3 and Troll 2 as my fab three.

It's kinda funny the first couple of times a guy pretends to get shot though there's no impact dust or wound, but the 68th time it happens it's just lame and you begin to wonder when the next scene is coming up. The dialog is also hit or miss with some ridiculous one-liners and cheesy rebuttals. Some are funny, some are just stupid.

The main actor, Robert Zdar, looks ridiculous and part of the amusement is really the casting. They got some pretty good-looking girls for the movie, too.

2013002,5,B0001LYESC,"For true lovers of unintentional comedies, one can become overwhelmed during the decision process of the evenings viewing. With so many options to choose from you must adhere to a few key principals to narrow down your chances of disappointment. 1) There must be mullets, ponytails, or top notch DM style mustaches, 2)it should ideally be from the 80's or 90's, and 3) it must be a direct to video release. If you can obtain 2 of the 3 preceding qualities then you're most likely in for a great film experience. Well what happens when you get not only all 3 criteria and so much more? You get a gem known as Samurai Cop to blankly stare at in disbelief. In our 20 years of B movie viewings few have been as incredible as this. Now please understand that by incredible we mean absolutely horrific to the traditional movie enthusiast. This caliber of film can only be appreciated by a truly unique individual or it will get lost in translation. If you happen to be one of these lucky souls then Samurai Cop is an experience that will leave you speechless. If you have any doubts simple search for some movie clips and get a taste of what this beauty holds within.

Samurai Cop opens up with a Japanese gang called the Katanas wreaking havoc throughout LA. The gang's main henchman is the giant faced Robert Z'Dar who does a great job of keeping you uncomfortably mesmerized by his huge freak head. After the Katana's most recent antics, the police force simple cannot contain the gang's stronghold on the city so they call up a poor man's Lorenzo Lama's known as Joe ""the samurai"" Marshall and his very awkward partner. In no way at any point in this film does Joe qualify for the ""samurai"" title so don't set your martial arts expectations too high. The first interaction takes place at the Katana gang's favorites restaurant where Joe throws out some extremely hallow threats which bring an all out brawl in the parking lot. About 15 henchmen come running out with guns blazing yet get manhandled by Joe and his ponytail of power. As Joe fights, his extremely challenged partner just sits around watching and focusing so intensely to remember his lines....which he butchers at every turn. The entire movie consists of these epic fights, shootouts, and oddly places soft-score scenes with no true understanding as to what's actually happening. As the Katana's begin to unravel their leader and his perfectly groomed mullet must take matters into their own hands. He enlists a final battle between the freakishly headed Robert Z'Dar and Joe ""the samurai cop"" which ends in typical B fashion. The Katanas are dismantled as the film closes out with an very uncomfortable scene of Joe in a speedo with his girlfriend on the beach. Yeah that seems about right.

As the credits roll you will be in absolute disbelief of what your eyes had just witnessed. We honestly couldn't remember a film where the lines were so frequently butchered, and we have seen a lot of B over the years. On more than one occasion you can actually see Joe's partner forget his lines on camera and attempt to forge ahead with absolutely no idea of what's going on. Joe ""the samurai cop"" spouts out the typical tough guy on-liners as he attempts to pounce on any female that crosses his path. This guy looks like he got booted out of the adult film industry and into the B market. He unfortunately has only done one other action movie and now runs a successful flea market in Gators Breath Florida. Our favorite though may have been the Katana gang leader who was an Asian fellow with absolutely no accent. He sounded more like a someone attempting to pull off their best Cheech Marin impression. This movie is packed with so much goodness that your brain will barely be able to handle it. To truly understand the beauty behind this film you must find it and watch. If you have a love for 80's-90's action then make this a top priority in your weekend plans.",1380067200,2,3926,4.631276901004304
2013003,4,B0001LYESC,"From the mind of Amir Shervan, (who prior to this movie directed Hollywood Cop) comes the 1989 smash hit Samurai Cop! For a while this movie at least for me went largely unnoticed, I'd see it in stores and laugh at how ridiculous the cover art was but I read a review from TLA Video I decided to give it a shot. I won't mention to much in terms of plot, just a few things that might make other customers want to take the plunge. The first thing I really liked about this was the obvious rip-off of Lethal Weapon, the dialog between Joe Marshall (Hannon) and Mark Frazer (Washington) is hilarious. Robert Z'Dar's  is really goofy before Maniac Cop. The other character's have no acting skills, their presence and delivery on screen makes this movie entertaining. But the most important aspect of this film is Matt Hannon. The prototypical 80's good guy/cop complete with huge upper body and excessively long hair his racial comments and arrogant do-it-yourself attitude make him the star of this cult gem. Hannon hasn't done much in Hollywood aside from a small role in Night of the Creeps and the Blob (1988), this was the biggest role for this poor man's Mel Gibson. Apparently Hannon died in 2012, he was unknown but left a legacy with this ignorant 80's classic. Add this to your collection and remember ""you have the right to remain silent...

2013005,2,B0001LYESC,"Samurai Cop is one of my favorite terrible movies, and I was ecstatic and equally bewildered at the news that remastered special edition was coming out.  I was instantly down for a copy, even though I own the other DVD release of it.

However, my expectations went over the apparent scope of this release, sadly.

First of all, why is this on DVD?  I thought a decent blu-ray quality transfer would have been possible if they sourced a 35mm print.  I know it's silly to demand HD quality from such a poor old movie, but they did it with Miami Connection recently and it turned out wonderfully.  If you're gonna do something as absurd as a 'Samurai Cop Special Edition', why not go all the way?  The fans will likely pay extra for it anyway.

Second, the interviews reveal just how slapdash of a production this was.
I understand if the odd, unnamed interviewer can't personally meet with the cast and crew for an interview, but recording a blurry Skype call and apologizing for it with a title card done in Windows Movie Maker is probably about the least amount of work that could have been done on these features.  Furthermore, telling fans on Facebook that the DVD was delayed to include an extra interview that then doesn't appear on the disc is disappointing on top of disappointment.  As well as a lie?  I've no idea what really happened there.

It would make sense if the other DVD, with its fitting sleazy presentation and comic commentary track, was out of print and someone had to carry the torch to keep this movie alive....but that other version is still seemingly in stock on Amazon as of this review.  And it costs less.  I appreciate the effort to bring out other Amir Shervan movies, but why do we have to put up with a disappointing product to get those?  More importantly, why would we want those releases if this is your proof of concept?",1370908800,2,1856,4.548192771084337

The extras include 3 interviews, all of which give insight on the interviewees themselves, as well as what it was like to work with Amir Shervan on the set.

Unearthed from a vault in Italy we get a cheesy ""B"" movie that has quite a following. If you're going to watch it you must go into with said spirit. This is far from Academy Award material. In fact, it's so laughably horrible at times that one feels it's best viewed with a group that is willing to make fun of it.

In the words of a commentator (paraphrasing): ""9 breasts, 54 dead people, eye gouging, multiple throat slitting, threatened crotch torture, 2 explosions, 5 running gun fights, head rolls, arm rolls, gratuitous circumcision chatting, head bashing, army slicing, gangster road kill, flaming getaway driver, 2 samurai sword fights, 5 kung fu scenes, gratuitous gay Costa Rican waiter, Cameron the hot female who fights all her fights in stiletto heels and one of the the funniest sword fights ever.""

What's it about? Basically a cop with a really bad mullet who has to catch criminals named the Katana Gang (get it? Derp, derp), brag about his fluent Japanese yet never uses it and seduce some women with bad 80s hair styles and kill every gang member. Wait, don't you need at least one to testify in court or give more information about the investigation. Ah, who cares about that, right?

Some of the best dialogue ever (not!):

One guy shoots somebody and his friends says, ""You got him!"" ""Yeah, i got the ba**ard""

Backseat drivers yell at the driver to ""Go! Go faster!""

""Don't move! What are ya gonna do shoot me?"" (with a gun in his face). Then a bad cut and he disarms the guy before he can fire!

People shoot from cars like retards and the other side ducks several seconds later. People shot fall out of the back in melodramatic deaths.

Unknown 80s style music plays. Stonewashed jeans. The wig on the head of our hero  changes midway through the film and it looks like a mop at times.

Misfire or cocking his gun and shot by the man. I like the way he gets hit and flies back like a bulldozer plowed into him.

Horrible death scenes after somebody is shot.

What was with the kung fu Fu Manchu fight? The guy was pretty good at first and then he gets his arms put behind his back? Did he get tired or did the move people run out of money and had to end it suddenly?

A whole lot of kung fu action comedy with gore and naked women.

2013019,5,B0001LYESC,"I found out about this movie a couple of years ago by accident. A co-worker and I were discussing movies one day. I asked him what the worst movie that he's ever seen was & he immediately answered ""Samurai Cop"". After he described a bit of it to me I immediately went out online and ordered my very own DVD of this hilariously awful 1989 buddy cop film of sorts. Being a huge fan of bad movies that are so terrible that they become highly entertaining, I can safely say that Samurai Cop  reaches the upper (or would that be lower) echelon of bad movie greatness.

The film features horrible dialogue, horrible acting, horrible action scenes (that in a lot of cases they just sped up the film to make things happen faster), horrible direction and some of the worst editing you're likely to find anywhere. The budget seems to maybe been about 100 dollars too. But somehow like other best worst movies such as ""Troll 2"" & ""Megaforce"", the movie somehow transcends its inherent awfulness and becomes something highly entertaining for all of the wrong reasons if you happen to be a glutton for cinematic torture. Not all bad movies can attain this level of greatness, but every now and then something like Samurai Cop comes around and shows you how a properly entertaining bad movie should be done! I would like to state though that the cover art on the DVD has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL MOVIE! :) It's also great how many people in the cast including Matt Hannon as the title character only did this one film and never worked again. I wonder why?

The DVD is an open matte transfer that appears to have been taken from a VHS copy and it seems the movie was intended to be matted to a 1.85:1 asepct ratio as sometimes things are visible in the frame that weren't meant to be seen (such as  the scene in which some thugs threaten the Samurai Cop's black sidekick Frank's manhood) but overall it's very watchable and the sometimes poor picture quality only adds to the fun. Drive in movie expert (make that legend) Joe Bobb Briggs is on hand to offer a hilarious introduction to the film giving a brief history of how the film was discovered and also offers a side splitting funny commenatry track too. B-movie legend Robert Z'dar who plays a main bad guy in the film gets a brief interview segment too in which he amusingly gives his thoughts and recollections so many years later on making Samurai Cop.

While I love truly classic and great cinema, I also need to sometimes give in to my unsavory cinematic tastes from time to time and visit the bottom of the barrel of bad filmmaking for a change of pace. If you are like that too, than I can't recommend Samurai Cop enough. I swear that you'll never stop laughing once you press play!

Update on 4/17/13: A anamorphic widescreen DVD of Samurai Cop is being released April 19th and was remastered from the original camera negative that was recently discovered.

2013021,5,B0001LYESC,"After watching RedLetterMedia's ""Half in the Bag"" review of Samurai Cop, I couldn't not buy and watch this movie. It is seriously a masterpiece of horribleness. As another reviewer already pointed out, I can't imagine anyone would or could give a serious review of this movie. It's just that bad. If you don't believe me, go watch the trailer on YouTube.

Samurai Cop is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. And I might even put it just a sliver above Troll 2. Troll 2, while clearly deliciously inept, has bored me about halfway through the couple of times I have tried to watch it. This is not the case with Samurai Cop. The lines, acting, delivery, direction, production and choreography are all so terrible that it's fascinating. I couldn't look away.

An interesting thing happened to me while I watching Samurai Cop, though. About halfway through the movie, I'm not sure why, I began to watch the movie from a serious standpoint. Everything that came before was just so laughably bad that I was giggling. But it's almost like the movie turned my brain into mush, and my standards were lowered as I was watching the movie. I stopped laughing so much, and can only describe my watching the second half as if you were watching someone run repeatedly into a wall face first. Eyebrows scrunched together, wondering what in god's name is going on.

But regardless, I would honestly recommend watching Samurai Cop, unless you can rent it for cheaper ($13.50) is a little steep considering this movie falls into the 'So-bad-it's-good' category. I'd also recommend watching this in a group with friends, because you will find it much more enjoyable. Though it won't be wasted if you watch it solo. I really can't say exactly why this movie is so bad, because it's really just something that you have to see for yourself, and trying to describe the awesomely bad dialog wouldn't do it justice.",1310428800,,1893,4.765243902439025

The Samurai Cop and his wisecracking black partner, Frank(they remind you of a micro budget Crockett and Tubbs), set out to bring the evil thugs down, but priorities are priorities, and it seems as though Samurai Cop's need to get laid is the top priority.  Meanwhile, the lovable Robert Z'Dar is the evil second in command of the Katana gang and has made it his mission to slice the Samurai Cop into sushi.
You could call this a B movie, but that's giving it way to much credit.  Maniac Cop was a B movie, and this doesn't even come close to that film.  It looks only a hair above home movie picture quality, the dialogue is simply jaw droppingly bad, the fight scenes and car chases are accomplished by speeding up the camera, the sound(the spoken dialogue anyway) was obviously recorded after the shooting and dubbed back in(giving it an odd sound I might add), the fx were bad(one guy is obviously being shot with red paint pellets), hell it was all bad.  Nothing was done right.  And for a so called samurai movie, it had very little as far as martial arts go.
The Samurai Cop himself is a long haired piece of muscular beefcake played by Matt Hannon in his only film role.  Of course Robert Z'Dar is the only person in this film who can even remotely be considered a star(okay Melissa Moore is in it too, but that's not saying much)  Z'Dar does well at playing the typical Z'Dar role, and I will say that it's easier to buy him as a samurai than Matt Hannon(but I will say that Hannon knows a move or two).
The disc has an interview with Robert Z'Dar, which is always a treat because he has such a quirky sense of humor.  He's well aware of the kind of films he makes, and while he never says that Samurai Cop was good, he does seem to have pleasant recollections of making the movie.  Another plus to this disc is the funny intro and MST3K type commentary with Joe Bob Briggs.  Very entertaining I must say.
Well, that's about it-A nice DVD package for a not so nice movie.  Samurai Cop is one horrible friggin' movie, but in the end, that's the best thing it could be.",1237593600,6,2616,4.36701030927835
2013026,5,B0001LYESC,"This is a real find. ""Samurai Cop"" is one of the all-time greatest bad movies in history. There is no possible way to review this film from a serious standpoint. Amir Shervan wrote, produced, and directed this monstrosity, so I hold him chiefly accountable. The DVD has great extras including an introduction and commentary track by Joe Bob Briggs, who is in even better form than usual here, as well as an interview with Robert Z'Dar, who is apparently attempting to follow the path of jocularity and girth popularized by Marlon Brando.

The plot concerns an undercover cop played by Matt Hannon who is attempting to break up the horrifying Japanese Katana Gang, of which Robert Z'Dar is the chief enforcer. There are so many problems with the film that I have no idea where to start. Well, now that I think about it, I do: let's start with Matt Hannon's hair. I have never seen a mullet like this in all my life. For the first half of the film I was actually asking myself if he was wearing a woman's wig from the Jaclyn Smith collection. This full, flowing mane of hair is as much a character in the film as any other actor, and seems to simultaneously represent the Samurai Cop's masculinity and femininity. If you don't think that's possible, watch him kiss the girls; it's disgusting.

Aside from the hair issues, the film features all the idiotic characters and plot points you would expect from a grade-Z film: the angry police Captain, the goofy sidekick (who laughs inappropriately on numerous occasions), extremely attractive women in hard to believe situations, and absolutely horrendous dialogue which, while gratuitous, fails to further the plot. To illustrate this point I direct you specifically to the exchange on circumcision, and the constant refrain of ""keep it warm"" which you just need to see for yourself to grasp how stupid, yet un-sexy a statement it is.

There are some great monologues about good and evil from Samurai Cop (my favorite is in a restaurant where he contrasts the Katana Gang with honest, hardworking Japanese-Americans) and, of course, the obligatory fight scenes. These generally come down to gun play, knife play, and karate. In the gun fights, I am constantly amazed that people in a gun battle find the most exposed place possible to stand (the middle of a door; an open field) when firing. This contributes to the extremely high body count in the movie as everyone and their brother gets shot by the end. There area couple of knife episodes, including a very lame ritual suicide (remember, death before dishonor). And then there is the karate. This is by far the best part of the movie. The scenes are moderately well choreographed, but to make them appear more professional Shervan constantly speeds up the film so that the action goes way faster than would be possible. This is, I suppose, an attempt to improve the dynamic energy of the film, but in reality makes it look more like a cartoon. These karate scenes (and a couple of the high-speed sword fights) are delightfully hokey; do not turn away even for a second during them. Please also note the bacon grease torture. Truly a scene of restrained understatement.

Again, the commentary from Joe Bob is one of his very best pieces of work, and I recommend watching the movie first without it then with it. For a wonderful piece of mid-1980s junk cinema, ""Samurai Cop"" absolutely cannot be beat. I highly recommend this one to any and all lovers of bad movies.

Keep it warm.",1140048000,20,3478,4.7611940298507465

8014265,5,B0001LYESC,"This would have been an abysmal derivative cookie cutter buddy cop drama had it not been for the bad acting and unintentional humor...this probably was made when all other ideas for action films were used up....think of Lethal Weapon, Police Academy, Gymkata, Highlander, and other action films that merged together to make ambitious action flick, throw in some bad dialog and the soft porn, and you have this big mess called Samurai Cop....
Lots of things to point out which are funny, like the idea that Det. Joe Marshall (Matt Gannon) is believed to speak fluent Japanese and presumably knowledgeable of Japanese custom yet he doesn't speak Japanese or bow to the Crime boss upon meeting him at the restaurant...the henchman Yamashita (Robert Z'Dar) looks too Caucasian...the nymphomaniac doctor at the hospital...Marshall's partner (Frasier) talking too much about the color of his butt...the cliched police captain who chews out the detectives utters a disturbing metaphor regarding his situation (TMI)...sex, violence and alot more which would take 7000 characters to write down....
All in all, this film is a roller coaster of laughs...
Enjoy at you own risk....",1505433600,3,1169,5.25668449197861

From the awful dubbing to the close-ups of actors that were obviously shot somewhere else. Also, the awesome car chase where they just drove the speed limit and sped the footage up. Very thankful there's a blu-ray for this flick, worth the money. Don't waste your time with Samurai Cop 2, tho. Total waste of time.",1498089600,,416,4.635135135135135
8014268,5,B0001LYESC,"If god-awful movies are your thing, then you simply cannot pass this movie up. Horrible voice dubbing, no white balance in virtually all shots, continuity errors (there are various scenes where it's clear the crew filmed on different days at different times. Also, the actual location literally changes numerous times. I effing love it), and so much more. Granted, my opinion may be biased since I have a penchant for crappy movies, but that shouldn't sway your decision to watch Samurai Cop.

What makes it so endearing is you can tell everyone from the director to the actors are trying to make a great action film to the best of their abilities. I cannot recommend Samurai Cop enough.",1497830400,2,687,4.822033898305085
