To me, the colorized versions are less clear and more fuzzy than the B&Ws but are certainly better than not having them at all.  I wish Disney would re-release the originals along with Scarecrow of Romney Marsh as these were two of my favorites from the 50's and 60's.",1376697600,,376,4.357142857142857
