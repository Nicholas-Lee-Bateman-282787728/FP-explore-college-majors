8682491,5,B00O87J8S6,"First rate concert video. Not easily categorizable music but there are elements of folk and jazz, as well as ""gypsy"" .
The shipment was nearly two weeks from a third party seller at ""normal"" shipping rate with no updates. But it did eventually arrive via USPS in good condition with no defects.
3 1/2 generous hours of a concert from one night in Dublin. Most ""live"" concerts whether CD or video are compilations of several nights high points.
Every aspect of this video is superb; musicians, sound mixing, lighting, and of course Leonard ""you lousy bastard"". This is a video for adults with the emphasis on respectful music making. Cohen recognizes each member of his cohort and is obviously proud of their contributions. It would have been nice to have the lyrics in a booklet but I know that adds to the cost of packaging.
What stamina Cohen displays for a nearly 80 year old man! His poetic lyrics are melancholy, transcendent, tender, and defiant. Just like life.
A minor video criticism. The three female vocalist were frequently zoomed in too close so that the outer two were partially cut off. They deserved better coverage.
The BR quality is excellent. I have not seen other Cohen videos so I can't make comparisons.",1501459200,,1225,4.783018867924528
