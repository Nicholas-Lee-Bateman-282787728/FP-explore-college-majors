8451037,5,B0050C4LDU,My kids are huge lego fans and they love this set!  The first one is definitely (admittedly) low tech!  But somehow it comes off as charming-maybe bc my kids like to make their own lego movies so they can relate !  The Jericho movie is a step up and equally as fun.  Plus it's just nice to be able to our a movie in for my boys (ages 4-9) and not worry about inappropriate material.,1422316800,,382,4.053333333333334
8451038,5,B0050C4LDU,Comments from him: I like that the lead character falls in love with the woman.  The friend is funny. The war.,1393891200,,110,4.238095238095238

8451040,5,B0050C4LDU,"I loved this lego set.  This is for sure ""homemade""- but it is funny, cute and worth the buy if you have one that loves legos!",1371945600,3,126,3.8461538461538463
8451041,5,B0050C4LDU,"It is so refreshing to have Biblically sound entertainment for kids, especially incorporating their very favorite toys!  Thank you, ShatterPoint, for making these top-notch videos available!",1368403200,3,190,6.3076923076923075
8451042,5,B0050C4LDU,Lego stop motion is all the rage.  These videos gave my stop motion artists lots of ideas about how to use clay and other add ons to make their stop motions better (i.e. think outside of the Lego box).  The booklet was a nice bonus.  It gave still shots so the reader could study how some pieces (like the ark of the covenant) were made.  Lots of fun that lasts well beyond the viewing of the videos.,1362960000,3,400,4.1558441558441555
8451043,5,B0050C4LDU,"I got this for my preschoolers and they enjoyed it.  My early reader loves the comic book and ironically actually likes the less techically polished, Moses and Pharoah DVD.  My husband and I loved the humor while appreciating the respect shown for the actual text of Scripture.  Over all, very pleased with this purchase.",1362268800,3,321,4.907407407407407
8451044,4,B0050C4LDU,"I ordered these for my 13 year old son. He's an avid Lego fan (purest -- must be Lego). I ordered them mostly in an attempt to give him ideas for the stop motion Lego videos that he does. (He is currently working on a different Bible story.)

He enjoyed the videos -- and the blooper reels on them.

If you are unsure about these, I would suggest checking online for video previews -- to be more confident in your purchase.

Definitely worth the cost and investment for me.",1357776000,3,473,4.292134831460674
8451045,5,B0050C4LDU,"Got this for my mom, who is an avid lego fan. She enjoyed these dvd's all though they are short in length.",1342828800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8451046,5,B0050C4LDU,"These are fun and remarkably accurate depiction of the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt and a very well done Joshua enters the Promise land . There is some humor with the Lego characters commenting on their inability to bend their arms and their lack of fingers in addition to a really well done story line . I am pleased with the accuracy of what is presented . There is no trying to explain away what is recorded in the scripture which is refreshingly honest . The first DVD has very limited production value , these are not professionally done , how ever the third ""Joshua"" has a much higher grade of productions more Lego figures much more variety of those figures . There is a greater number of frame shots per min giving a smoother appearance to the illusion that the characters are animated . The children enjoyed the DVD their ages were four to eight years old I am 60 and I enjoyed the DVDs . Well worth the price .",1326412800,,921,4.329479768786127
