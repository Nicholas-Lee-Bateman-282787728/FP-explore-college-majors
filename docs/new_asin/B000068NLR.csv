7964303,3,B000068NLR,Disney makes a lot of excellent childrens movies.  This one is just good.  My children did not love it.  And I can say its didn't hold a lot of magic for me either.  This is just a matter of personal preference.  Someone else might love it.,1349481600,2,240,4.130434782608695
7964304,3,B000068NLR,"Maybe if I had paid $10 instead of $18 I would consider this a better buy.  Unfortunetly, I paid too much.  My 4 1/2 year old daughter is in LOVE with Ariel, so I bought it and was not real pleased.  Neither was she.  The find Sebastian game was fun for about 3 minutes (she found him every time) and the story is narrated with still pictures from the video. (maybe a different story about Ariel would have been nice)  I do think the foreign language part is cute, although a little tough to understand for a 4 year old.  All in all, for $10 it's a decent buy...but no more than $10!",1037491200,11,583,4.115044247787611
7964305,5,B000068NLR,"DVD READ-ALONG - THE LITTLE MERMAID is a fantastic thing for the kids and adults. It has the complete story of the Hans Christian Anderson story of The Little Mermaid with all the character voices and a great narration by actor Roy Doltrice (TV's Beauty & The beast) It's all the original cast too. Jodi Benson (Ariel) and Buddy Hacket too!
The menus are cleverly put together and the graphics are fun. The extras include music videos with sing-a-long capabilities and words as well. There is a game that you can find Sebastian and a vocabulary section that everyone can learn foreign words. There are even two rock videos of Kiss the Girl and Jodi Benson herself singing Part Of Your World. That is very good.
The best part for me and the kids is the fact you can listen to this story in six different languages. A very cool feature I wish I had as a kid. Our kids today are going to be smart in several different languages. You should get this. It's fun and musical! (8-15-02)",1029542400,17,978,4.4692737430167595
