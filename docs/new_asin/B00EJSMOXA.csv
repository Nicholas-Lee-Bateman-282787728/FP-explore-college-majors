8606102,5,B00EJSMOXA,"This is a TV series prepared by Arthur C. Clarke in the 1980s for British television.  In the series Clarke reviews contemporary (for that time) evidence to either support or refute various claims of the existence of certain ""psychic"" phenomena.  If you are looking for something sensational about psychic phenomena this series is not it!  Clarke approaches each topic in a dispassionate and clinical manner and simply reviews all the information of which he had possession at the time of filming.  A good part of each episode is taken up with personal interviews.  The only really spooky stuff is saved for the last episode in which he also gives his personal opinions about the existence of the phenomena which he covered in the preceding episodes.  I feel that Clarke does an excellent job with the material he covers and offers lessons in critical thinking for anyone whose vocation or avocation requires critical thinking and writing.  For that reason alone I recommend this series.",1425859200,,987,5.0184049079754605

8606104,4,B00EJSMOXA,"Overall, a good watch.  To be fair, it is an old show and cannot compare to the modern and more fast moving shows, but it is still worth the time to watch.  The show did cover numerous topics in the world of ""strange powers.""",1400025600,2,225,4.090909090909091
