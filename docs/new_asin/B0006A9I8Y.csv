8040935,3,B0006A9I8Y,Disc was brand new but it was missing the insert and the movie box got damaged when it was shipped. Other than that the movie was pretty great.i recommend in watching at least half the episode of urusei yatsura episodes to understand what is happening and why Lum wants touse the love potion on Ataru.,1337040000,,301,4.490909090909091
8040936,5,B0006A9I8Y,"yea!!! now ataru has a reason for all that lust!! i bought this one at the colorado anime convention in october of 2000. this is a fun story to see and all the characters play a role (big to small). if lupica were real, i would have to tell her that she should've stopped being so damn shy and tell the tofu man rather and force him to fall in love. oh well different strokes for different folks.",1129680000,2,396,4.089743589743589
8040937,1,B0006A9I8Y,"Ok, first of all I thought personally that this ending movie was not what I hoped it would be. I hoped that Ataru were to kiss Lum and say he loved her. But this was not a good concluding ending to Urusei Yatsura! Though, I did like it a little. Ok, here is the entire unconcluding movie plot: Ok, Ataru at a festival meets a princess that carries a bazooka gun. Lum as you would expect, tries to stop him from going in the princess' UFO. Now she used Ataru to get a love potion for her, because she was in love with a tofu boy. But Lum wanted it to give to Ataru. So the way that the drinker of the potion falls in love is that the drinker falls in love with the first person they see. (A spoof of cupid's arrow huh?) This in my opinion is a movie to watch BEFORE the last episode.",1113350400,,782,3.9556962025316458
8040938,3,B0006A9I8Y,"This movie, ""Itsu datte My Darling"" in Japanese, was released some years after the ""Final Episode"" (""Urusei Yatsura Kanketsuhen"", movie 5).  In watching this movie, you'll have a sense of deja vu; just about every plot element in this movie comes from earlier movies in the series.

Seen by itself in isolation, it is alright; but compared to the others it is a disappointment.

The absolute best Urusei Yatsura movie is #2 (""Beautiful Dreamer""), rightfully considered to be director Oshii Mamoru's masterpiece.  #3 (""Remember My Love"") is perhaps the most typical (and with an awesome theme) and easiest for non-Japanese to understand.  #1 (""Only You"") is probably closest in ""feel"" to both the manga and the TV series.  #5 (""Kanketsuhen"") is an outstanding finale to the series (but be sure to watch the Inaba-kun story OVA first for necessary background).  #4 (""Lum The Forever"") is just plain wierd but beautifully done.

Compared to the others #6, ""Itsu Datte My Darling"", is just a disappointment.",1112140800,3,1003,5.073170731707317
