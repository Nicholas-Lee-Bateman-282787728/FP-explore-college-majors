8490964,4,B0061SURKI,"I found the idea behind this series to be quite intriguing. The idea of reticulated pythons, saltwater crocodiles, and Komodo dragons growing much larger than they already are is both a fascinating and frightening one! This series looks at the science behind such an idea, and I think it does a pretty good job on that. Of course, if this idea becomes an reality, let's hope it doesn't happen anytime soon!",1482796800,,406,4.732394366197183
