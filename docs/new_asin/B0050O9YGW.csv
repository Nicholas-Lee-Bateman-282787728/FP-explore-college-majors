4516804,4,B0050O9YGW,"Storage Wars is a 20-minute fast-paced show with 2 acts.

Act 1:  Bidding Wars
Our main characters, along with others who happen to be there, compete in auctions for storage garages (when people don't pay their rent on their unit, they go up for sale).

The main attraction here is the competing nature of the characters. Throwing nasty wods and occasional assistance, mixed with money and profit, makes for some good drama.

Act 2:  The Appraisal
The characters appraise anything worth value. The appraisers often give history and meaning behind the value. It's like a competitive version of the Antiques Roadshow or Pawn Stars.

You'll learn interesting facts about both interesting and mundane pieces. A seemingly dull punch bowl might net thousands while an interesting antique Coke product might turn out to be an artificially aged fake. It's especially fun when the poeple you don't like end up with the fakes.

The Characters:

Each character has their own purposes.

Dave has a giant shop to keep stocked, so he's after high-end profits. He has tons of money to bring to the table and a large team to help move.

Jarrod and Brandi have a quaint little shop with very little money to spend. So they're after the marketable stock.

Darrell is a sniper of a bidder. He'll be quiet until something very nice shows up. He's looking for high profit goods to sell.

Barry is a retired guy looking for unique collector's items. He could care less about making a profit. He only bids when he thinks the unit has something he wants to put in his living room.

This is a great show to watch for the character interactions and the appraisals. However, it's not terribly great for rewatch value.",1321488000,16,1690,4.766323024054983
4516805,5,B0050O9YGW,Received it in my mail just 3 days after ordering.  I couldn't find season 2 yet but I will get it as soon as it comes out.  I love amazon.,1315958400,,139,3.6
4516806,4,B0050O9YGW,"5 stars for the show. 3 stars for the DVD. I wish they had extras included, like interviews, commentary, ect.",1315699200,5,109,4.5
4516807,4,B0050O9YGW,"There are two ""storage pickers"" shows out there.  This one and Auction Hunters.  I prefer Storage Wars since I find the 'characters' far more interesting in this show.

The show centers around a group of four auction hunters (each has a nickname such as ""gambler"" and ""maverick"").  Each of the groups has a different perspective/reason for coming to the storage locker auctions.  As an example, one is a husband/wife team who own a small thrift store and are looking for items to sell at their shop.  Another character is a guy who is looking for big ticket items hidden in the lockers.

The show really is like a treasure hunt - you never know what they will find.  I am a bit skeptical of the estimated price of the items.  The figures seem to be really random or unreliable.  And when they add up the estimates of value at the end of the show, one group is declared a winner for the week - but with the randomness of the estimates, it seems a bit silly.

In all, I enjoyed the first season greatly and look forward to season 2.",1298592000,,1030,4.368421052631579

4516819,5,B0050O9YGW,DVDs were in great shape and arrived quickly. The price was very good and made a good gift.,1446422400,,91,4.111111111111111
4516820,2,B0050O9YGW,"I bought this for a buck at a yard-sale. Did I get my money's worth? Yes...but if I paid more, I'd have been disappointed.

So, I watched all 19 episodes over both days this weekend. I admit that I was a bit hooked at times, but it had nothing to do with any of the actors. The excitement came from just seeing a cool find, but was diminished when I knew a jerk bought it.

Various thoughts...

- the woman Brandi was pretty-annoying at times; ""Really? You're falling for Dave's tricks again and spending our entire day's budget on one locker?"" she mentioned in one episode; I found myself saying to the TV ""You're ridiculous. Say something right to the guy you're in business with and not the viewing audience.""; she's 'done' inaction like this before

- Barry is the most likable, with some funny ideas (the small-person on stilts to see in the back with night-vision: awesome; psychics: silly) and even offering stuff from his bins to others

- only in the final episodes do you see others actually bidding and not just the main players; others are never named by the auction-guy; of course, he knows the names of the ""pros""; it annoys me to see people just standing around and not even looking in the storage units; there is no episode where anybody outside of the actors lost a locker to someone who wasn't a part of the show

- Darrell was alright overall (I hear that he's more of a jerk later, so...whatever; I'll never know)

- Dave was an unfunny clown in every episode, with a smug look and the most-visible greed; I'd never buy anything from any store he's involved with; he bids on stuff he doesn't want in order to ""prove a point"" and to be sure that the competition pays more; his character is there since the creators would want someone that people ""love to hate"" who hope to see him by a crap-unit; sadly, there are people behaving this way in many businesses

- buyer Barry to annoying Dave: ""Actors are professional. You're the one that referred to this as a profession. It's an auction.""; to me, this is just showing that everyone's an actor and I don't believe any of this is real

- in a later episode, a bin was shown containing a car and it was said that the car wasn't included since, by law, they had to notify the DMV and have something done first; however, in an earlier episode, an old, odd-shaped vehicle in a bin was sold (it was covered-up and unknown ... so, there's a difference when it's not seen? there's no standard rule of ""if you find a car, you must do (this)""?

UPDATE 4.18: I reluctantly watched the first episode again and realized that one guy bought a car in there; this car was about the only thing in there and definitely recognizable as a normal car with a cover over it; any mention of the DMV? nope; maybe the law wasn't in effect until many episodes later?

- the first episode's opening spoke of how the storage space of these things in America covers so much space that there would be enough room for every ""man, woman, and child to fill 7 times over"" (close to that); I doubt that's true (and it was only mentioned in the first episode)

So, I give this a generous two-star rating (which accurately means 'I don't like it' according to Amazon). I won't be seeing any of these again and don't care about any other episodes.

I've had more fun with ""Pat, the NES Punk's"" FLEA-MARKET MADNESS on YouTube than with this. I'm into filming my thrift-store and rummage-sale experiences while commenting and having a good time. Even if I can't afford certain things, just hearing stories about stuff or seeing neat items and having a recording of it is a blast.

Hopefully, I can make a profit and sell this three-disc set for $2. This could have been much-more interesting to me, but in the end I must bid ""Yeahhhppp!"" ... I mean ""Nohhhpppe!""

UPDATE 4.13.2015: I've now read that the guy had ""Yuuup!"" trademarked and there's lame merchandise with it; interested? ""Nohhhpe!"" (TM)",1428796800,,3925,4.50070323488045

4516943,5,B0050O9YGW,I love this show. Then I wonder...how is it that at so many of these auctions there are so many people at the beginning and then it ends up being a showdown between the four silly stars.  Where did all the other people go?  I like treasure hunting...so I get excited when any one gets a great find in a locker.  This is a rough business....I can only imagine.  The best thing about watching this was not have have to wait SO LONG between commercials.  Loved it.  I am on to Season Two very soon.,1401580800,,495,4.157894736842105
4516944,2,B0050O9YGW,"I watch Storage Hunters and it seems more interesting than this.  You have a couple who own a second hand store who want to buy bins to get stock (the youngster), a guy who wants stuff to sell at the swap meet (the gambler), a rich guy who wants to find a cool object to collect or sell (the collector), and a complete jerk who thinks he is king of the trailer trash (the mogul).  The jerk (Dave Hester) doesn't want to buy the bin, yet he loves to bid everyone up and make them pay more.  He wins nothing but people hating him.  The only people who win on this are the storage facilities and the auctioneers.  The gambler (Darrell) is just horrible to his son who is trying to learn the business.  If I were his son, I would go get a job somewhere else.  The young couple (Brandi and Jarrod) are fairly likeable, but sometimes they call each other horrible names which is sad.  The collector (Barry) is the most likeable and funny one there.  I mostly enjoy all his cars and motorcycles he drives to the auctions.  He is the nicest of the people (always treating them to snacks and giving people parts of bins).

The part that isn't very true is when an idiot like Hester starts stating what items are worth.  He will say ""this is worth $199 retail, I am MAKING MONEY!""  Yeah, not really.  Cut the price in at least half and then realize that some of this stuff is in storage because it could not sell at all.  At least Jarrod and Darrell put more realistic prices on their items.  I just do not understand why a bidder feels they have to ""school"" another bidder or if someone comes to their ""backyard.""  Who cares if a new person wins a bin that they do not want anyway?  Why do they have to make the person pay hundreds or thousands of dollars more?  Hester will say things like ""I would never sell this junk anyway, but I want to make him pay.""  WHY?  These people don't even sell the types of things he does and putting a company out of business is a pretty terrible thing to do (he hasn't yet, but it seems like he wants to be the only person in the world who owns a company).",1401408000,,2082,4.193954659949622

4516954,5,B0050O9YGW,"I thought this show was going to be boring but was wrong completely after watching one or two episodes.  Immediately, I was hooked.  It was entertaining to watch the bidders try to out bid each other especially knowing that they each have a different purpose as to why they want the items in the lockers or simply want to raise the bid for the others.  It is especially exciting to find out the treasures that people store in their lockers and then forget about it.  Each regular bidder/buyer has tricks up their sleeves from repetitive trial and error.  I find the show funny.  Definitely, both entertaining and informative at the same time.",1397606400,,642,4.6875

Brandi and Jerrod are delightful,  Darrell is just so full of himself he is both likeable and funny but also to be pittied because sometimes he just doesn't get it! But my most favorite person is Barry! I love when he dresses up in costumes, or comes in on one of his different modes of transportation, and he always seems to have fun looking for an ""antique"" whether he finds it or not. And he seems to know everyone! It's just a fun show to watch.",1395878400,,546,4.2

4516969,5,B0050O9YGW,Enjoyed watching this series. It gets you involved to  root for the underdog and boo the villain . I enjoyed learning about some of the unusual items that they find in some of the lockers. Kinda like antiques roadshow .,1394582400,,219,4.475

4516978,3,B0050O9YGW,I watched this often for a while but over time tired of what seemed like a soap opera than a civil war.  None of the charaters appeared like they could deal 4 hands of 13 each before running out of cards (jokers aside).

4516990,4,B0050O9YGW,I actually did not think I was going to like this show. I thought perhaps it would be mush to the brain. Voila! It was entertaining and I was looking forward to the end to see how much the buyers would get from their finds. I gave it four stars as there are other shows that will challenge my thought process such as Masterpiece Mystery. This show is good for some down time and enjoyment.

4517012,5,B0050O9YGW,"I love this series. First of all, I never knew about auctions on storage lockers that were in default. Never really thought about it. My family and I found it really interesting. Certainly a series I would recommend.",1382572800,,216,4.7105263157894735
4517013,3,B0050O9YGW,"Though the show can be educational at times about antiques and collectibles, it generally is the kind of program you can just sit down in front of and turn off your brain for a while.

I enjoyed the episodes more which explored the background behind the main people who go to the auctions and deal with stuff they buy--the life of those who run thrift stores and so on--but a lot of the show seems contrived at times.  I can just see these guys sitting around discussing how they can have a fight in the next episode or pull off some goofy stunt, like bringing so-called psychics to the storage lockers.

Worth watching once is you are interested in the mystery of what can be found in the storage lockers and how much some items are worth.  The rest...well, yeah.  A renter more than a keeper of a show.",1381708800,,804,4.369127516778524
4517014,5,B0050O9YGW,This television show about peoples' discarded treasures is entertaining- one never knows might just turn up in one of the lockers that the protagonists purchase. It reminds me very much of being a young girl and doing the yard sale route every Saturday in the summer with my Grandmother. I really had found a treasure back then and hadn't known it- a Napier ring with a cage that held one of six polished gemstones. I saw one recently at an antique shop in New Hampshire for $220!,1380931200,,480,4.528735632183908

4517025,5,B0050O9YGW,"I don't know why, but I love this show.  It has a bad guy and an underdog so I find it interesting to root for one scoring big while rooting for the other to bust out.  Not really a how to guide, but definitely entertaining.",1377475200,,224,3.9555555555555557
4517026,4,B0050O9YGW,very entertaining!!!  Barry makes the show :)  Darrell is just an a**.  We watch the show often and find it cool.  Wish they would actually show these guys actually selling the items at the price they think its worth.  It's just their estimation of value that's not backed up by any actual sales.,1377388800,,296,4.509433962264151
4517027,4,B0050O9YGW,"I found I got caught up in it, while I don't like some of the characters finding out what is in the storage units is fun. I like the part after the bidding when they open the units.  I have learned about some of the items and had no idea.  I know people who lost storage units and I think of them each time I watch wondering if I am going to see their stuff.  I tried the Texas version and them I could not get into at all.",1377216000,,423,3.730337078651685

4517030,4,B0050O9YGW,Great mixture of personalities with the treasure hunt drama and education of Antique Roadshow. Great to watch with friends and guess out the value of items and what the locker will sell for. Often though you get the feel that there might be a little docudrama creative placement of items.,1376956800,,288,4.78
4517031,4,B0050O9YGW,"overall , All the characters played their parts very well . Its a reality show and for a change they did appear like they are playing their parts to truly represent their personality . I also liked the aspect of a little lesson in it, how one with years of dedicated experience has more indepth tools to take risk and make profits .",1376956800,,332,4.285714285714286
4517032,5,B0050O9YGW,Purely entertaining and interesting. Enjoy the quirky characters. Surprised at the items that people leave behind and that there is only a 90 day period before their stuff sells. The show is great!,1376784000,,197,5.0

4517036,4,B0050O9YGW,"The characters are interesting, and all play to the camera for a prime spot.  But, even though the mere act of observing these people changes the outcome, the interaction of the storage war cast is fun to watch.  My favorite character is Barry, who clearly enjoys life, knows he is putting on a show, and seems genuinely funny.  Brandi, who is a late comer to the cast, seems to be the smartest of all of them, and usually has the most insightful comments and the best business sense.

If you want 22 minutes of mindless TV, this isn't a bad way to spend your time.",1375574400,,565,4.352380952380952

I know they run up auctions for TV,  but boy is it fun to watch. I also like  how in year  one  details were given out and the  cast was  just starting to  gel on camera  and off.  Suffice it to say a lot has happened  since then  like any baby this series started to run  quickly....and the drama  and bitterness continues to grow today.",1374192000,,470,4.193181818181818

It is mind-blowing how much stuff is left behind in these storage auctions.

There's something about the mix of the personalities (Barry in particular), the situations, and premise that make this, irresistable television (albiet guilty irresistable television at that).  At times it can be a little staged and hokey, in particular all the bs bravado between the players, but, so be it.  I'll watch a little posturing to see the things in some peoples storage lockers.  Too, I dig the historical factor when they find something odd, unique, or historically significant.  All in all, a winner.",1371081600,,535,5.103448275862069

4517098,4,B0050O9YGW,"Two years ago, A&E's Storage Wars came out of nowhere and quickly became one of the highest rated shows on cable. The show is extremely addictive and I watch it religiously, but why? Most people think it has something to with the mystery about what's behind the door or the hunt for buried treasure, as usual; I have a different take on things. The reason this show is as popular as is it, is the buyers themselves. Reality TV is about watching real people in real situations. We like to see people who are just like us, struggling to survive, fighting with co-workers, etc. The cast of Storage Wars are people that we can relate to and more than that, they are interesting as well. Every week I can't wait to see what Barry does, who Dave's gonna fight with, and what inappropriate thing Jarrod is going to say to his wife. I believe the show's popularity has little to do with what's behind the door. It's the unique and interesting cast that keeps us coming back for more. The truth is that it doesn't matter if it's storage auction buyers, repo-men, meter maids, or hand fisherman, what we want is people we like and can easily relate to in different situation both inside and out of the office, and Storage Wars provides that and then some.",1361491200,,1245,4.488986784140969

It's educational like PBS's Antique Roadshow.  Storage Wars is a great character study as well.  Barry knows how to live life to the fullest.  Dave's business excels thanks to his street smarts.  Poor Jeremy is still learning; if he'd only listen to his wife Brandy.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",1354579200,,451,4.632911392405063
4517116,4,B0050O9YGW,"I look forward to Storage Wars each week as the colorful cast of characters go in search of hidden treasure among the abandoned storage lockers of the Los Vegas area. I need to suspend my critical judgement a bit for the fun of seeing the gang bicker and bid for what appear to be endless mounds of trash. Invariably someone comes up with a box of jewelry or a valuable antique, but it's best not to look too closely and just settle back and watch Brandi and Jarrod, Barry, the mysterious prankster, and Dave, the bully of the group. These are supposed to be real people, and they probably are, but it matters not because they entertain far more than most scripted comedy or ""unscripted reality shows"". Lots of fun, and no distasteful antics!",1347235200,,742,4.544776119402985
4517117,5,B0050O9YGW,"This show ranks right up there with Ice Road Truckers and Deadliest Catch as really well done reality TV shows. Storage units that have been abandoned are sold at auction, and this show follows the 4 people who make their living by bidding on them, Jarrod, Dave, Barry and Darrell. The only thing people bidding on each of these units are allowed to do it take a quick glance at them from the outside, never opening a box or touching anything. Each unit is a gamble on what's inside and if the person buying it will be able to salvage anything to make a profit. Each of this shows cast members is very different from the others, and they seldom ever get along. This show is packed with all kinds of surprises, funny moments and lots of fighting. It's quickly become one of my new favorite shows and am hooked and ready for season 2!",1337558400,,832,4.374193548387097

It made her feel like she was home again.  She said the beginning was different because they didn't know each other yet, but soon it was like the series she remembered.  I am so glad it was available and could be sent to her.  What fun!",1337212800,,381,4.295774647887324

4517120,5,B0050O9YGW,"Storage Wars is an awesome TV show. It's a very fast pace show and it gets right down with the premise in every show. It works!

In every show does the same thing will happen. You see all the same characters going around looking in storage units and bidding on the units if they like them. Then, after auction, you find out what they bought exactly in the units. Sometimes they getting their money back, sometimes they losing money, or sometimes they make a profit. That's it! You going to see this exact same thing in every show. But it's so good because everyone loves watching to seeing what they bought in each unit. Then, finding out if they were right or not before buying the unit.

I think this shows makes more and more people come out and try to do what these people do in the show. They try to go out and bid on the units themselves, but we usually won't see other people bid and win a storage from the stars of this show. It does happen but we don't usually see that. I believe I only saw that happen once for all 19 episodes.

I'm looking forward to watching Season 2 next.",1335916800,,1086,4.236714975845411
4517121,3,B0050O9YGW,"It's hard to believe these guys are finding rare collectibles and valuable antiques within abandoned storage units so often. I know plenty of storage unit renters. Broken Ataris and E.T on Beta are the closest things they have to antiques. The lockers  are probably being stuffed for entertainment purposes. So why 3 stars when I have little faith in Storage Wars' credibility? Because I view it the same way I view a sitcom. Quirky characters with silly catch phrases; some like each other, some don't; and the outcomes are often hard to believe. Barry Weiss, the laid back jokester, is the most entertaining cast member. Those who prefer villains will vote for Dave Hester. The way Darryl and Dave overvalue their winning units for resale can be annoying. They'd price a bucket of urine at $50. This show might be the reason it's no longer easy to find cheap stuff at yard sales. I've seen horrible second-hand furniture priced at hundreds of dollars over retail just because some miser slaps a ""vintage"" label on it. Thanks Storage Wars, for making the inflation problem worse and encouraging everyone to overprice their junk.",1333324800,3,1129,4.9109947643979055
4517122,3,B0050O9YGW,"I manage a storage facility in Southern California.  I hate to tell you this, but there are a lot of reasons people ""default"" on their stuff.  Sometimes it is a death, jobless, but honestly, most of the time, it is just that that person (or company) realized that they have paid on the stuff for so long, that it is just not worth it anymore.  My current price on a 10 X 20 unit is $309 per month, plus $9 for insurance.  People pay it every day, an a lot of them are happy to pay it.  But it doesn't take long to tell yourself that you are upside down on the items.  If you have a sofa that has been in storage for three months, it is easy to say ""time to let that one go, and just buy a new one"".

We make every attempt to get the people in here to pay, even offering them the ability to  move out for next to nothing.  Sometimes, even move out for free. By the time it happens, it is too late to feel sorry for them.

As for the coin collections and such, a lot of times, the kids put grandmas stuff in storage after she died, and they didn't know what was in the boxes.  Or more likely (especially lately) it is stuff that ""The Talent""had in his store, that he brought with him to make it look a lot more interesting for the show.

I have had the show filmed here, and I know what I am speaking of.  One time, I saw the same stuff that the one buyer had purchased at an auction here, that he ""discovered"" in a unit. It was right on top of the stuff he bought here, and the bidding got pretty fierce because of it.
While these guys are the real deal, (Barry is a true crack up) they are simply acting for the show.  In fact, when they filmed here, they ALL got into Darryls truck and went to lunch together...it's an act folks...",1330560000,17,1732,3.982608695652174
4517123,1,B0050O9YGW,"Yes, it's fun to go treasure hunting in abandoned storage units. But it's good to keep in mind this stuff did not just pop up from nowhere. Behind the scenes are other people's losses. According to California law, 'abandoned' means just three months of unpaid rent. Why would anyone abandon a unit full of property - coin collections, restaurant equipment - unless due to some personal tragedy, death, prison, illness? I would have more respect for this show if they occasionally went and interviewed the people who were forced to give up these units, and learned why. That would be more of a true ""reality"" program and not just a vulture program.",1328313600,9,647,4.785714285714286
