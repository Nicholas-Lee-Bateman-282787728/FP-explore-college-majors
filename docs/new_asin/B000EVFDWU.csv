8114646,4,B000EVFDWU,"A different way of getting revenge.

Deadly Daphne's Revenge is a story abut a hitchhiker named Cindy who goes for a ride with a bunch of party animal redne***.  One of them gets drunk and keeps hitting on Cindy (named Charlie) so she has to continue pushing him away the whole ride.  She wants to be dropped off in San Diego but the guys continue driving forward.  Cindy questions it, and you know, she should've been asked to be dropped off right away when this happens.  Obviously when the driver continues on it means something bad's going to happen.  That's how it goes in suspense films!  Not that these boys would let her go without a problem of course.

When they arrive to the lodge the guys are staying in, well Cindy thinks one of the men (Steve) will protect her from his drunken dishonest half-brother, but sadly that's not the case.  Really the half-brother is the only truly bad person of the group.  They do some drinking and partying, even Cindy has some fun.  Charlie tries to have sex with Cindy again due to all the excessive drinking going on, but luckily Steve steps in and stops it from happening.  While in bed Cindy thinks she's being protected by Steve, but sometime in the middle of the night Charlie wakes up and walks into the bedroom to rape the girl.  He defends his actions by saying ""She's been around"" even though the others in the group say she's just an innocent girl and doesn't deserve to be raped.

Charlie comes up with a lie that Cindy woke up angry and cussing at Steve, and even saying how men ""Always run out on her after they had gotten what they wanted"" so Charlie had to smack Cindy just to get her to shut up, and that's how the blood got on the pillow.  Steve realizes the story doesn't add up.  Charlie continues to insist she was easy and has been with plenty of men, even though it's clear by her screams during the rape that she feared for her life.  Cindy files a report and cries in her defense of Steve.  She clearly likes Steve and doesn't want to see him get punished in any way.  The lawyer mentions how difficult it will be to punish just Charlie despite Cindy crying in her desperation to protect Steve.

Charlie gets a rape warrant for his arrest.  Funny while being arrested a woman yells ""Charlie, what's going on!"" and he says ""I'm going to a picnic, what do you think's going on?""  LOL!  Also hilarious when the one guy's (lawyers?) wife picks up the morning newspaper, sees her husband's name on the front concerning the rape case and says ""Your name is smeared all over the paper you horny worm!""  He tries to defend his involvement saying that Charlie would take care of it but... no, Charlie didn't!  Later on during a fight, she demands a divorce and even says it's too bad he didn't try killing himself 2 years earlier.  She says ""The next time you talk to me it'll be through my attorney!""  He becomes so emotionally messed up after this he picks up a gun and kills himself.

Charlie goes to a lawyer, and the lawyer says he has to admit Cindy was in the house the night of her rape because the jury certainly wouldn't believe they were playing tiddlywinks most of the night!  There's a lot of arguing going on between the lawyers in this movie.  The one defending Cindy has his hands full because the other lawyer says the four men are respectable and Cindy doesn't have a chance because it's her word against theirs.  No one was at the scene to back up Cindy's claims.  As you can guess, Charlie's actions caused a LOT of grief for many people.

When the lawyers go after Steve, he defends himself by saying Cindy was only a week away from turning 18 but looked like she was 25.  Yeah... that defense won't hold up man!  Charlie's lawyer has a chat with Charlie and stresses that he better make sure Steve and the others have his back or he'll have to find a new place to live.  Meanwhile Cindy blames herself for her lawyer shooting himself.

Steve and Charlie argue, and Steve demands ""I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do!""  Charlie comes up with an idea that none of his friends have to go to trial.  Charlie gets into an argument with a Spanish guy who claims he knows what really happened.  I think he was at the party in the beginning but can't say for sure.  There were a lot of men at that party in the lodge, so it's hard to keep track of them all.  Charlie says ""Just keep your mouth shut!""  I like the argument two scumbags get into while on that boat.  The one says to the other ""There's something wrong with your mouth- it's open when it should be shut!""  One of these scumbags knows men who can secretly eliminate people (a hitman) for a price, which catches Charlie's attention.  Charlie just needs to give this guy the money and Cindy will be killed.

The lawyer questions if Cindy really wants Charlie behind bars because she suddenly wants to drop the case.  She can't drop it now- she's in too deep!  She's already gone through with the information and charges have been filed.  The lawyer says she can be held responsible for perjury in the court of law.  Lawyers continue to argue.  Cindy's lawyer claims Charlie nearly broke her jaw, but the other one says Cindy is beginning to feel guilty for forcing (railroading) Charlie.  Charlie's lawyer says that Cindy dropped all charges.  Unless... Charlie bribed someone or threatened to kill her in some way.

The lawyer threatens that nothing better happen to that girl, not realizing Charlie already made a deal to have her killed.  Otherwise Charlie would be in for it then.  Charlie goes to the scumbag guy from earlier and asks to call off the deal to take out Cindy.  More like begs, but he says he never actually sees the men who carry out the crimes so he can't make any promises.  Charlie asks Steve to try and win over Cindy  If Steve goes through with it, Charlie will give Steve the deed for the lodge for free.  Charlie wants Steve to tell her he was going to rough her up a little bit.  It's extremely important that Cindy doesn't get hurt after the conversation/deal the lawyer had/made with Charlie.

Steve meets up with Cindy at a bar.  Whoa, great song playing in the background!  Don't know who sings it.  Steve insists he didn't know Charlie was going to rape her that night.  He was sure Charlie would pass out and not cause problems.  Steve wants Cindy to defend him by convincing the jury he didn't mean to leave her alone with Charlie that night.  He even tells Cindy that Charlie paid a large sum of money to have her killed so she didn't have to be appear in court.  This of course upsets Cindy.  She wants to run to the cops but can't.  It's already a big mess of a problem here!

Steve and Cindy come up with a plan to keep her protected.  A van/hitman follows Steve and Cindy back to the lodge.  He keeps an eye on Cindy by sneaking around behind trees.  Steve and Cindy discuss the rape that night.  Cindy says she was in fact raped, but Steve questions if she screamed that night.  He's trying to get the facts right.

Steve then tells a VERY important story that changes this movie's story in a big way.  It almost makes it ten times more confusing.  He mentions 5 years ago Charlie had an affair with a young black girl named Daphne and brought her to the lodge.  He was married at the time.  The girl fell in love with Charlie but she wanted him to leave his wife.  He refused.  Daphne was vindictive.  She somehow got to Charlie's son, beat him up and killed him.  Charlie went crazy and beat the girl like crazy.  She was sent to a hospital.  Charlie's wife left him and took all his money.

Steve came across a bushy haired thing during a walk in the forest one night.  It scared him like no other.  While these stories are going on -the first story in the daytime while Steve and Cindy are sitting on a bench outside and the second story indoors at night- the crazy hitman with a gun is outside aiming his shoots at Cindy.  But... someone clobbers the hitman.  Cindy wakes up screaming that night and holds Steve out in the hallway.  So this is twice Cindy couldn't get a peaceful nights sleep at this house!

When Steve wakes up in the morning he walks downstairs and sees Charlie with his friends.  Now the story gets crazy.  Steve thinks it wasn't a hitman out there that night- it was Daphne!  She came back to kill Charlie as revenge.  I now realize how *horrible* it is the movie's called Deadly Daphne's Revenge, because the title gives away a crucial character in a big moment of the story who was nonexistent until now!  I admit I WAS wondering why the movie wasn't called ""Deadly Cindy's Revenge"".  Now we know, haha.

I like how the storyline goes in a very different direction suddenly though, and doesn't end with the typical courtroom drama stuff (where the story appeared to be heading).  We see a dog while Charlie's hunting in the forest with the Spanish guy, which explains the yelp we heard during the clobbering of the hitman.  Scumbag Charlie goes and shoots it.  He gets into a fight with the Spanish guy over shooting the dog.  Of course in movies, the dog runs away first before dropping to the ground.  So fake!  Charlie explains the dog would just roam around breeding and that's why he did it.  Suddenly Daphne appears and stabs Charlie to death!  That was sudden.  No lead up or anything.  We see Steve and Cindy ride off into the sunset determined to be a couple when the case is finally over.

What!  Not a good ending at all, haha.  The story builds so much into Cindy's rape case that I feel betrayed another character suddenly enters the mix, kills Charlie and then everything's suddenly over.  It ends way too soon, and feels unresolved.  It would be like someone spending a long time building a huge sandcastle only to kick it over one day for no reason.  Strange ending, but a solid story otherwise.",1496448000,,9829,4.428172163219676

8114652,2,B000EVFDWU,"DEADLY DAPHNE'S REVENGE (aka: THE HUNTING SEASON) opens w/ the title character crawling around w/ her pet dog. This goes on for five whole seconds before Daphne disappears- for the next hour and twenty minutes! The scene switches to four men on their way to a hunting lodge for the weekend. Their leader, named Charlie Johnson (Anthony Holt), is a detestable, drunken redneck. He looks like Hank Williams Jr., and sounds like Tommy Chong! These four idjits pick up a young hitchhiker named Cindy (Laurie Tait Partridge), take her to the lodge, where Johnson rapes her. Next, an hour or more drags by as Cindy and her lawyer grapple w/ the finer points of the law. Very little else takes place until the finale, when Daphne -remember her?- shows up for her vengeance. Unfortunately, even this is dull. We are told of her relationship to Johnson, and that's supposed to make up for any lack of a real plot. As TROMA films go, DDR is among their worst releases. There are several places where some sort of action, any action, would have made it more watchable. Ugh...",1436054400,,1064,4.695187165775401
8114653,1,B000EVFDWU,Simply awful. The plot is so beyond idiotic and the only thing worse is the incredibly bad acting. No redeeming value whatsoever.,1435968000,,129,4.909090909090909
8114654,2,B000EVFDWU,"Well first off, if you really want this head over to the Toxie's Triple Terror Vol. 1 and get this move and 2 others for a fraction of what they want here.  It is part of that set and that is how I watched it.

Overall, this is just very typical and run of the mill even for Troma.  You know the Troma formula, bad films with stereotypes and other extreme stuff meant to shock and entertain.  Here you have your usual characters - the girls - the redneck racist, etc but there is little entertainment.  The film isn't very funny and is not over the top bad to make it funny that way either.  The ending comes quick and is not set up well so there is little reason to watch this film.",1238112000,3,683,4.059701492537314

This  is a suspense/action/thriller,, and  revenge is

the name of the game. Beware  of women scorned. However I

believe I would be reacting the same way as the victims.
