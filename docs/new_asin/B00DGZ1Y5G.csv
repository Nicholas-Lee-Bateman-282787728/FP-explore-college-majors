Bill Stone is an aspiring film maker, and somehow struck on the idea of filming an acquaintances project: to build a stone wall, 1000 feet long in total, along the front border of a large piece of property which he is managing for an absentee owner.  The builder is Chris Overing, the property is  somewhere in Quebec province [though these people are speaking English], and the whole thing is a true story.  Stone turned out to have chosen a somewhat unfortunate topic for a first film.  Overings original notion was to complete the wall in 8 weeks.  Eight YEARS later, the wall is still un-finished, though one must admit a fair amount of it was built.  Along the way, one gets the distinct impression [from the captured dialog, as well as the film makers sections of monolog] that this documentarian crossed the usual line and was goading Overing into finishing the job, so that he could have a finished movie.  He finally had to call the movie finished, even though the wall was not.

Along the way, he took a trip to Scotland and met some true dikers as they are called there: men who know a good bit about building stone walls without mortar, because theyve done it their whole lives.  To me, the parts filmed in Scotland were really the most interesting, and the pieces filming Overing and his occasional assistants in Quebec were simultaneously disorganized, irritating and sad.  But heythis guy has put it out there.  Eight years in which he spent time trying to make a movie, and Overing trying to make a wall, both of them apparently amateurs who would have benefitted from quite a bit more planning and research before embarking on their respective projects.  If 90 minutes of viewing seems a not unreasonable task for you to draw your own conclusions as to whether this is funny, or philosophical, or mundaneit is a lot easier viewing it for 90 minutes than living it for 8 years, I suspect.  I give it a C-.",1409529600,,2075,4.600543478260869
8593069,4,B00DGZ1Y5G,"This amiable, meandering and finally satisfying documentary follows Chris Overton, a self-taught rural Quebec stonemason as he plans to build a 1,000-foot long stone wall in eight weeks.  Ten years into the project, the wall does not seem to be fully completed, but the obsession and the process has yielded a film about expectations and two guys - the other guy is filmmaker Bill Stone (yes, stone) - who are stumped to explain exactly what they are doing and what it means - if anything.  Clearly the lesson learned - at least by the viewer of the film - is that art and life are much more about the process than the thing itself.  Or maybe not.

What I really liked, and why the movie is worth seeing, is for the last 30 minutes which are spent in Scotland with a ""diker"" who has spent 20 years learning his trade of making free standing hedgerows and explains why his is the best life possible.  I found a new way to think about stones that help in my own quest to be ever more mindful of the precious passing moments.
