8044901,3,B00076HXBQ,"The (I assume) student filmmakers have some good ideas here, especially in the brilliant idea of making Goods resident in a computer and making Everyman a late 70s Yuppie.  But I agree that they should have considered modernizing the dialogue (which wouldn't have taken much effort at all).  This was made on about half a shoe-string, but a pretty good job overall, given the limitations.  This was released in 2002, but it appears to have been shot c. 1980.",1263254400,,458,4.772151898734177
8044902,1,B00076HXBQ,"This is by far the worst film I have viewed in a long time.  It appears to be an independent student production shot very badly on digital cameras...home cameras.  The editing is bad, with repetitious shots (like in a cartoon) and the picture cuts out at one point and cuts back into the next scene with Good Deeds, and from that point on, the sound does not match up to the action/speaking.  The director's choices are just odd, along with many of the costume choices as well.  The acting is not particularly good, and it is only updated in setting...the dialogue remains true to an early translation. The two contrast badly.  I don't doubt they all worked hard on this production, but sadly, the result is definitely not worth the money...or time to attempt to view it...unless you want a good example of bad film making.",1174262400,4,823,4.609589041095891
8044903,1,B00076HXBQ,"This DVD is listed as the only film version of this Middle Ages play.  I was not impressed with the production values, sound, image or acting.

I appreciate the effort, but not the end result.  I had purchased the DVD for possible viewing by theatre students, but decided not to share or recommend it after viewing it myself.

It is worth a viewing, but not that memorable.",1128384000,7,373,4.522388059701493
