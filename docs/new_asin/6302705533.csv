8178118,5,6302705533,"This is a great workout!  You will work hard, but the time will pass quickly, because the choreography is fun.  The choregraphy is moderately challenging, but perhaps easier to catch onto compared to Sweat Express or Body Tech.  I'd recommend this for intermediates and advanced, but beginners can also start here and work their way up.  This is a worthwhile addition to any workout collection.",1121126400,,394,5.015384615384615
8178119,5,6302705533,"This workout is FUN! I don't really feel like I'm working out. The floor aerobics are definitely harder than the step aerobics, but once I learned the moves the time just flew by! If you purchase this video (which I recommend if you are fairly coordinated and enjoy more advanced routines) take time to go over her steps before doing the workout. It's a lot like learning a dance routine. The music, provided by Dynamix, is some of the best workout music to come along. Even though this video is now 13 years old, the music doesn't sound too dated, although maybe the outfits in the video are!

A few things to take into consideration:

-You'll need quite a bit of open floor for the hi/lo aerobics

-Carpeting is okay, but hard floors are better; there's a lot of pivoting

-She provides alternative moves for beginners, but Kari herself always does the more advanced moves

-Some of the cool down stretches require you to balance on one foot, so you might want to be near something like a wall for stability",1114992000,,1009,4.552486187845304
8178120,2,6302705533,"I have over 25 step aerobics videos.  Everything from Gay Gasper, Kendall Hogan, Kathy Smith, Gin Miller's Reebok series, Buns-of-Steel, Jane Fonda, Cory Everson, even Cher.  Many of them I keep as part of my rotation of at least four per week.  Kari Anderson's Two the Max is the one I go to the least, if at all.  I liked the concept: half of it is step aerobics, the other half is aerobics without the step.  The step portion is pretty good.  I would say it is intermediate level.  The first section of floor aerobics, however, is overly complicated.  So much time is spent learning the moves and turning the correct way that it's hard to concentrate on the areas your working out.  Control is such an important part to exercise.  I don't think the movements are very controlled in this video.  The cool down I actually found to be the worst part.  At one point, you're asked to do a lunge back into a pleeay (excuse my spelling) very fast.  Knee position and body alignment is so important in those moves they are not something that should be done quickly and recklessly.  I experienced a sharp pain in my knee and never did this move again.  This is the lowest score I've given to a step video.",1046390400,2,1199,4.435779816513762
8178121,5,6302705533,"Kari Anderson is one of the most experienced video fitness instructors I have ever seen.  Her moves are simple and repeated enough to be learned, but not boring.  The music is ""peppy"", but not corny.  It's also  original music, so that is a bonus.  I recommend it highly!",916704000,5,271,4.5625
