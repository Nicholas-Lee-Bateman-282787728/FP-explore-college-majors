8727532,5,B013FGAUGY,"This film is wonderful and strange. It's gruesome and naughty, like the once- oral tales popularized by the Grimm Brothers, in their effort to combat everything Napoleonic and Prissy. Based on the work of Giambattista Basile, the film lightly ( very lightly) weaves together the strange tales of three kingdoms, one headed by a a Queen who will give up anything for her child, one by a lecherous king whose love of beauty leads to an ironic and hilarious end, one headed by a king who loves his pet flea more than his child. All in all, it's a great film to share with a group of good humored friends and a bottle of wine( food might be iffy). FYI: Ours played just fine on a US Playstation 3.  There was an option for an English soundtrack in the menu.",1463011200,2,753,4.378571428571429
8727533,5,B013FGAUGY,"Artistic and well done. Interesting story lines, cool fairy tale elements, and the ""gore"" is done in a way that's not really gory. It's not as gory as a movie like Friday the 13th or nightmare on elm street. Wouldn't let children watch this obviously but fun for adults! Definitely weird movie though.",1461888000,,301,4.69811320754717

8727535,4,B013FGAUGY,"This is an adult tale of three storybook kingdoms which include magic, witchcraft and sorcery. The first tale involves Salma Hayek as a queen in an odd version of ""The Prince and the Pauper."" The second kingdom involves a princess who desperately wants to leave the castle and explore the outside world as her father holds an odd contest for her hand. The third involves a lustful king tricked into spending the night with an old woman.

The three tales swap back and forth in case you get bored. The cinematography was grand and better than the plots, whose theme appears to be: Be careful what you wish for and something to do with birth and death. The sorcerer was going to explain it, but Salma Hayek wanted the Cliff Notes version.
