8499991,5,B006K31SPM,"The various Just Planes cockpit videos are superior products and the ones featuring Air Canada flights may be the best of all. Since these pilots usually speak native English their explanations and comments are much more easier to understand than those of the many foreign airlines the pilots of which are not native English speakers. And in this particular production the Polar flights are especially interesting as in addition to the North Pole they overfly Russia, Mongolia and China. And the length of these flights provides ample opportunity to detail the special features of the B777LR and the special characteristics of overflying the North Pole. This is a fascinating exercise.",1480636800,,685,5.236363636363636

8499996,5,B006K31SPM,"I have always enjoyed the Just Planes videos, and with the addition of high definition and Blu-Ray, they have gone to another level.

These are not scenery videos.  We start with a lengthy explanation from the dispatcher, get the full treatment with the crew pre-flight, and fly two very long trips from Canada to Hong Kong, including take off, various activities in the cockpit en route, cabin activities with the flight attendants, and landing.

We have multiple cameras in the cockpit which is a new feature for the Blu-Ray discs, plus more video of the aircraft on the ground than we often get in this series.  Quality of the video itself is amazing, scenery is awesome, crew explanations are great, and you get to see things a normal person would not.

A must buy for anyone who enjoys flight in the cockpit videos.  There are nothing like these Blu-Rays.

The only caveat and my only wish for the future is that Just Planes stops trying to make it a literal movie.  With the in the cockpit video and the out the window camera, and the length available in the Blu-Ray format, they should give us a chapters which are:  window camera from push back to cruise, cockpit camera from window to cruise, window camera from top of descent to landing, and cockpit camera from TOD to landing.  That would have made it perfect, instead of constantly switching from view to view.  If you really want to concentrate on the cockpit activity, or really want to concentrate on the outside view, you are always a little frustrated.",1332028800,5,1519,4.672932330827067
