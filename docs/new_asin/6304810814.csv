3874871,5,6304810814,"This movie is heart breaking. After watching it, you wish it was fiction.  A naive Irish American gets pulled into a situation that she may never make it out from.  Her romantic notions of supporting the causes of Ireland take a harsh turn when she comes face to face with violence.  It shows how much one should count the cost before getting involved in things they don't really understand.  This is a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone who is considering embracing a ""cause"".  It shows how lack of conscience can be on both sides of an issue/cause...and how people can redeem themselves by reclaiming their humanity",1371859200,5,633,4.666666666666667
3874872,5,6304810814,"I watched this movie on Hulu and later bought it on Amazon. Here are the reasons why I LOVE this movie:

*Independent film= Lesser known actors= More believable performances
*Filmed entirely in Boston and Belfast, rather than somewhere else and passed off as Ireland
*Based on a true story
*Violent but not gory

Each time I watch this, I find new parts that I missed before (and I've watched it about ten times!). Linda Amendola makes you feel for the real Alex, no matter how anti-violence you are. Mark Newell brings incredible emotion to the confused, desperate Sean. He is harbouring a dark secret, and obviously feels guilty about his decisions. The interactions between the two are excellent and make you wonder if you wouldn't have done the same in Alex's position. Finally, Aidan Parkinson is horrifying as the ruthless Damian Ryan. A cast of brilliant supporting actors makes your heart break with every twist.

Anyone interested in the Troubles of Northern Ireland should definitely watch this movie. It isn't ""The Devil's Own,"" doesn't star Brad Pitt or Liam Neeson, and wasn't a box office hit, but it will affect you more than any blockbuster ever could.",1315008000,5,1168,4.918781725888325
3874873,4,6304810814,"You can tell from the moment the film began it was a low budget movie.  Yet historically, those who joined the Irish Republican Army were mostly from lower income/working middle class families so the low budget filming and actors makes it more real. The acting is not superb but I felt the action and plot were developed very well. For the most part the intensity builds nicely especially at the scenes when the girl is hiding out with the woman who owned the pub. Its based on a true story and I did not think the lead actor did a great job of capturing the audiences attention span nor did she come off as genuine.  Yet I did enjoy seeing the suspense build watching the UVA and IRA trying to hunt her down. The last scene was full of suspense and kept me drawn to the movie.

If you enjoy movies based on the Troubles and Civil War that took place in Ireland, then this is a solid film to watch.  There are a few twists in the movie and several characters such as Belle and Damien who have such strong personalities that add flare to the story line and focus of the film.",1287187200,7,1074,4.25
3874874,5,6304810814,"People that are rating this movie poorly don't get the point of the story. It's a true story. No matter your acting preferences, it is about what it was really like in the 70's thru the 90's in the North. If you care about the reality of the North then you will enjoy and be tormented by the story. If you do not then you should skip the movie.",1449187200,,344,4.0
3874875,1,6304810814,"What a terrible movie, the scenes that are suppose to be shot in Ireland (US electrical outlets/light switches in the background) are clearly not shot in Ireland, not an Irish landscape at all, just an awful move overall.

8357043,1,6304810814,".., because whatever grain of truth is the basis for this film is utterly lost.  This is a pitiful film from the standpoint of cinema, no cliche has been spared.  There are very few movies on the topic I would recommend.  Honestly, ""The Crying Game,"" a great film in its own right, is he only fictional account of any merit as relates to Operation Banner (or, The Troubles).  To give some grounding to this assertion, to the literary merit of that film, I'll point to the fact that Neil Jordan drew upon two seminal short stories any student of Irish literature (written in English) as a brilliant literary device.  Last point to the Jordan's film, it's a masterpiece of cinematic expressionism.  I should leave it at that but ...

I would be writing this in Irish (Gaeilge), but the expectation that it would be censored restrains me.  I lived in Ireland during the same time period, and have a not dissimilar background from the protagonist.  To the point, we would have been exact contemporaries.  Which is why I am called upon to wonder if the storyline itself isn't based on a complete fabrication.  A lie.

Before continuing, I need to say categorically that I am not a shill for anyone, nor to I countenance violence.  I'll volunteer (no pun intended) this much: I was for a time living there friends with the son of a former Chief of Staff of the PIRA during the 1970s, a very, very well known figure.  HIs son, my friend, was named after a young man killed in a botched raid during the border campaign during the 1950s.  Anyone who has spent 10 minutes in an Irish pub anywhere on the planet knows who I am talking about. Oh, in ""friend,"" like, I went to his grandmother's funeral with him.  He, my friend, was entirely uninvolved in politics or anything related.  My point here is that this film is a cliche based upon a cliched historical inaccuracy.  And, trust me, I know what I am talking about all too well.  Wish I could say more.  On a constructive note, I'll let Amazon and anyone interested know that you can stream Irish language television (all but the news is dubbed, if anyone is curious).  A number of brilliant documentaries and films have been produced, including one by a former professor of mine about a female member of the PIRA that I would highly recommend as one of the most incisive biopics I've ever seen about anyone. Period.

Oh, right, Patriots.  Yeah, well, um, here's the bringdown: Don't waste your time or money, there's more art and history in either one of ""Tommy Boy"" or ""Weekend at Bernie's.""",1501718400,,2537,4.576496674057649
