4860848,5,B005R2SHX8,"I grew up watching this cute and funny show. A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.

The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs  the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.

If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get. Plans to release the other two seasons are in motion, but I think sales of this first set will determine the fate of the other two releases. It's a bit expensive, but I really enjoyed seeing this again. ......people let me tell ya 'bout my best friend!",1328054400,41,1210,4.417040358744394

4860850,5,B005R2SHX8,"Watching The Courtship of Eddie's Father again transports me back to 1970.  Seeing the styles of then does date the show, but that is part of the charm.  See Bill Bixby before his Hulk days.  I can't wait until they offer Season 2.",1327622400,5,231,4.325581395348837
4860851,3,B005R2SHX8,"These are fond memories of a simpler time.  Eddie was so sweet we named our son Brandon after the child actor.  The first DVD is clear and lovely.  The downside is that now I am hearing impaired and closed captioning was not an option in 'the olden days'.  I cannot distinguish most of the dialogue, but love it all anyway.  The first disk, at least, seems fine, although the case it arrived in was mashed to smithereens but there was no way to communicate to Amazon without returning the entire package.  Explaining this to a real, live person isn't possible without a phone number and the choices in the return items screen do not fit the situation.",1326672000,5,651,4.521367521367521
4860852,5,B005R2SHX8,I don't know when I last saw this show on TV but I always had fond memories of it growing up watching it. I was basically the same age as Eddie. And now rewatching it as an adult I can totally appreciate it on a different level. The relationship between father and son is so open and loving that I cant think of another show that showed such a relationship between parent and son. Looking forward to the next two seasons.,1325203200,17,421,4.209876543209877

4860860,5,B005R2SHX8,One of my favorite television shows. Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz are very believable as a father and son. The show is both funny and at times very touching.,1444608000,2,156,4.413793103448276
4860861,5,B005R2SHX8,"I'm lucky, says six-year-old Eddie Corbett (Brandon Cruz).  Most kids have fathers who are just dads.  But I have a father who's my best friend.  Eddie's mother died some time ago (we're never told exactly when or of what, although Eddie remembers her telling him that it was his job to look after his father, a charge he interprets as meaning he has to help ""find girls"" for his dad to date; he was probably about five, because he apparently hasn't been to kindergarten, and when it comes time to enroll him in first grade, his dad wonders if it's too soon).  His father, Tom (Bill Bixby), is the 32-year-old managing director of Tomorrow, a newspaper-insert magazine.  They live in a high-rise apartment in Culver City with a breathtaking view of L.A., and their Japanese housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston (Miyoshi Umeki), who comes in by the day, calls Tom Mista' Eddie's Fatha and has succeeded in teaching Eddie to speak rather respectable Japanese (their exchanges tend to leave Tom baffled).  Peripheral members of the family are Tom's free-spirited art director (and Eddie's honorary uncle), Norman Tinker (played by series producer and occasional writer or director James Komack), and ditzy secretary Tina Rickles (Kristina Holland).

Bixby and Cruz bonded almost instantly, and the chemistry between them is very real (indeed, the show's success spurred bachelor Bixby to get married and have a son of his own).  This is one of the last of the gentle, old-fashioned family sitcoms that could address problems in a semi-serious way, but it also has a definite late-'60's/early-'70's vibe, and with seldom more than two guest stars, it also has a cozy, intimate feel.  Many of the episodes focus on the kinds of problems endemic to child-raising, such as when Eddie is branded teacher's pet after Tom begins dating his teacher, or on bullying (a very young Jodie Foster appears as Josephine Joey Kelly, whom he, of course, can't hit back when she beats him up), first-day-of-school jitters, honesty, responsibility, academic stumbling blocks, following one's conscience, or the concept of generosity with one's possessions; but, as the title suggests, many others come from Tom's and Eddie's search for a new mother for us.  Eddie has all the innocent frankness of his age and sometimes speaks before he thinks, but he's also very good-hearted (once, concluding that Mrs. Livingston is all alone, he brings home a little Japanese boy to be her son), bright, and eager to please, and he and Tom spend a lot of time together (the teasers and tags show them on a variety of father/son excursions, from the beach and the amusement park to sailing and fishing to exploring the zoo and a large aviary, usually with Eddie asking questions).  This is a sweet, enjoyable sitcom that everyone can enjoy.",1438905600,7,2796,4.978540772532189

4860867,5,B005R2SHX8,"I think my brother and I watched every episode. I was 6 when this started already a fan of Bill Bixby we loved tuning in every week. This was a different time for our country and this show reflected it. I for one wish that time were still here. I wish the children of today knew that time. Harry Nielson had a song called ""People Let Me Tell You About My Girl Friend"" which when he needed money became "" People Let Me Tell You About My Best Friend."" The acting is great. The song is great and all I can say is I wondered, at 9, what happened to one of my favorite shows. It was gone. Well such is the times that have changed to become modern it just went away. If you ever catch Steve Harvey on the modern Family Feud you might see that even he doesn't understand what is passing as television today. It seems to make him sick. He once said that the word family shouldn't be in the title. I agree. He does do his stand up in front of adults not children. Anyway I remember when Bill Bixby died about the same time as my dad in 1992. I was in a somber state and that made me think of this show. My wife thinks of this show as well and we remember the great times of this great country. Long live an America that I Loved. Sorry to hear of its passing...

I think every young parent should buy this show and let your young ones watch it. It really is great. When people like writers really cared. Do you see that anymore? Or do you see them filling your kids heads with the ideas of the state. Act this way or you get no Bananas. Just saying.",1423353600,2,1539,4.013029315960912

4860871,4,B005R2SHX8,"Not sure why so many compliants on quality. Found dvds nicely packaged and the picture quality rather good for the 1969-1970 season and probably better than when I watched them as a kid with my folks. A very nice walk back down nostalgia lane-makes one truly believe America was a much more happy and free place in 1970 than it is in 2015. Tom Corbett played by Bill Bixby, gives a great insight into the mood of the country in 1970 as he plays the role of a  is a magazine publisher. Brandon Cruz,who is the only living actor of the series,plays Eddie. The acting is fantastic, when one sees the emotional contact between Cruz and Bixby one doesn't see the acting-the emotion feels very real and is very sweet. The sitcoms of this time be they The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Brady Bunch, Star Trek, or The Walton's make it easy to contrast what is aired today and the direction the country is moving racially, ethically, and politically.  -why not 5 stars instead of 4? No bonus material.",1419897600,3,995,4.522222222222222
4860872,5,B005R2SHX8,"Amazing quality. I am halfway through the first season and my wife enjoys them as well. The chemistry of Bill and Brandon is remarkable and who wouldn't love a housekeeper like Mrs Livingston. 'Mister Eddie's Father....'
The music is brilliant and the location footage really adds to the proceedings. Of course it is a slower paced show, but that is part of the charm, just like A Family Affair. No fast cuts and a laugh at every second line of dialogue.
The apartment looks HUGE on our big screen TV (as you would expect!).
You can even see scratches and paint chips around the door frames. The doors are also huge and the paintings and other wall hangings really stand out. I purchased all three seasons together and although slightly expensive, it is well worth it.",1418774400,,768,4.654411764705882

I grew up with Bill Bixby on My Favorite Martian, The Hulk and countless other shows he had appeared on throughout his career, And this is one that I would always remember fondly. So once I saw that it was on DVD I had to have it. Once I have seen every episode I will get season 2. It was the best friend concept between a father and son that I would from time to time draw from in the raising of my own 3 children. You win some you loose some, but if you don't try you win none and lose all! And these shows gave me a blueprint that I would try and model myself after because their message was motivated by love and there was always a lesson to be learned and to draw from.

Bill Bixby & Brandon Cruz had an excellent show with ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father.""

These are golden moments and its a joy to watch the episodes just for these. But the episodes/plots themselves are also fun.

All sets have been burned on DVD-R's just as you would burn a CD or DVD on your computer. Who knows what the quality of the DVD R disk is?

What you get are a set of disks that may or may not play on your DVD player. A couple of disks in each set may play on some players, but I struggled to find a complete set that would play on both of my players. I had to return these sets several times to collect disks that would play.

Essentially, the studio is so paranoid about copy protection that they won't let these be played on many players. The interesting thing is that I had no trouble creating back-up copies!! In other words; they have succeeded in frustrating people that want to play what they bought, but can't prevent people from copying!

Some shows don't age well. ""Welcome back Kotter"" seemed cool as a kid, as did ""Home Improvement"", but when I watch them now they seem so corny (How could I have liked that?). But some shows, like ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"", ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""McHale's Navy"" are ageless to me.

Bill Bixby and Cruz are soooo very good together, that you almost swear they are actually father and son. Co-star Miyoshi Umeki plays Mrs. Livingston, a kind and lovely Japanese woman with such powerful wisdom. I absolutely love her to death! When one thinks of all the garbage on television today, this show is so much better and isn't dated at all. It's a show that makes you smile, laugh, cry, chuckle and feel good. Absolutely great writing too... each episode has such wisdom. The dialogue of Eddie and Tom at the beginning and ending of each episode is priceless!

At the very least, any parent who enjoys the sayings of young children (ie: kids say the funniest things kind of thing) will thoroughly enjoy the interludes of Eddie and his Father talking and exploring the Train museum, the beach and the forest. It is pure heart warming enchantment!

Each half hour is so well written I laugh, cry and just relax....well actually there is a bit of suspense too! And of course I sing along every single time to the theme song!! The song writer/singer also does little bits of tune during the story as a transition bit... I have never seen this done since!

I highly recommend this DVD set for a pure enjoyable respite from our modern chaotic life!",1331164800,9,981,4.594285714285714

8484038,5,B005R2SHX8,"Enjoying so much! Used to watch as a child. Of course, I thought then that I was much older than Eddie...funny to now realize, I was actually just a couple yrs older than he! I watched an interview with Brandon Cruz and he said that Bill Bixby did not want him to do any acting;  he just wanted him to be natural. This is likely one of the reasons that he was  extremely good in his role as Eddie. A clean show with a lot of lessons. I especially love the affection that they display for one another. Unfortunately, some men feel and/or have been taught that displaying affection such as kisses and cuddling is not for fathers and sons. Its a beautiful thing to see and even more beautiful when sons who are raised with the same type of affection raise their sons in the same manner. It becomes  a beautiful cycle. And omgoodness, the song! I lovvvvve it! I will never forget the tune but didn't know all of the words  as a child,,,the tune was just catchy! I now know the lyrics and can greatly appreciate them,  they are soooooo cute and endearing! I just  the song!  Oh My Goodness!! I also enjoyed seeing different guests on the show! Very nice to see different ones back in the day. Cisley Tyson was beautiful, as she still is!! Love the fashion for the ladies and Mr. Bixby and Eddie also!  I love the different itroduction scenes before the show started ......not the same each time as typically with sitcoms. Very interesting to see! I don't recall ever seeing that with any other sitcom. Very cool!  I loved the random singing during different scenes in some of the shows. So unique and cute! I love the chemistry between them all and how Ms. Livingston was treated as a family member and Eddie Loved and adored she and Uncle Norman. I like Tina too, she cracks me up! Can't wait to watch with my grandson! Well done...Very Well done. The picture is  nice and clear; the color is spot on , the sound is great! I'm very pleased and so glad I ordered!

8484045,4,B005R2SHX8,"Sweetly nostalgic.  The relationship between father and son is super sweet and the core of the show.  I can get emotional hearing the theme song.  The '60s sitcom landscape was littered with widows (Lucy, Hope Lange, Doris Day, etc), but single widowered dads was given a groovy, sexy twist.  The sexism is kinda casual (as apparently were the hookups!), and the jury is out on the issues of Mrs. Livingston (Eddie learns Japanese and she is given a love life and visa issues -- but making her the exotic other was a way of having someone young and attractive as the housekeeper without worrying that the show would end with her and ""Mr. Eddie's Father"" getting it on. Problems notwithstanding, I binge-watched this and LOVED the trip back to my childhood.",1469664000,4,756,4.748091603053435
