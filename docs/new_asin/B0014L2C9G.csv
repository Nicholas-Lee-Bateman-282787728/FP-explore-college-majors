An impressive version of this classic novel, it provides three hours of tense, fast-moving, and often uncomfortable viewing. Worth watching.",1478908800,3,278,5.318181818181818

 There is no doubt that ""Crime and Punishment"" would have been one of the greatest novels of the century had not Dostoevsky leaned towards the more acceptable sense of morality related to the weak tenets of Chrisitanity. In doing so, he made Rasknolikov a caricature of himself, lethargic and yet redeemable by accepting Christ's pathetic suffering. It was more appropriate to adapt Nietzsche's figure of ""the noble superman"" but Dostoevsky, at the time of his writing, was a destroyed soul, drinking and plagued by debts, a gambling and morphine addiction and on top of that, he was a converted Christian, which is to say he resembled a ""spineless worm"".

There is a powerful beginning in which the bold character Rasknolikov conceptualizes the murder of an old aged hag who serves no purpose to society but beyond that, Dostoevsky tortures us with the conscience of an obstinate man who is shattered by an insignificant crime. In all effect, Dostoevsky became an apologist not only for bourgeois values and the Czar with his corrupt regime, but for Orthodox Christianity, which not only supported the exploitation of the Russian population but welcomed it. The end of the novel, which portrays a once proud, noble, and intellectually superior young man weeping before a prostitute and the image of the bible, brings about the demise of Dostoevsky's credibility.",1391472000,,1405,5.1

8256015,5,B0014L2C9G,"This was a wonderful production of Crime and Punishment.  It is very faithful to the book.  many scenes are as I saw them in my mind.  Only a couple peeves.  The main character was too short and a little too talkative (I imagined Rask to be much more sullen and less crotchety), and Porfiry, while exemplary in the role, is older than his description in the book.  These are just aesthetics though.  Wonderful, wonderful production for the short running time.  Would like to see a longer version someday though.",1261180800,5,511,4.674157303370786
8256016,5,B0014L2C9G,"This most recent BBC production of Crime and Punishment was shown on American television a few years ago, and I was blown away by how well the tension and psychological drama of the classic novel was captured on film.  (Please note: I am discussing the 2002 BBC production and not the 1980 miniseries that starred John Hurt; that version, to me, was simply so so.)  It is a shame that BBC has not yet released this 2002 production starring John Simm.  I have read Crime and Punishment several times, and seen many different versions of it, but the 2002 version is by far my favorite.  It was filmed in St. Petersburg, and manages to capture (no easy feat!) the psychological turmoil within Raskolnikov that forces him to first commit murder and ultimately to confess the murder.  The major side plots are properly handled as well, resulting in a film that properly conveys the brilliance of the novel.  Sadly, BBC has so far not released this amazing adaption in the U.S.  BBC: please make this gem available to American viewers!!!!",1255651200,12,1032,4.731843575418995
