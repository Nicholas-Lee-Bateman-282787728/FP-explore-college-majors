952998,5,6305006571,"With Kundun, Scorsese has accomplished a remarkable feat:  he has created a movie that evokes more than it tells.  His images create a true gestalt in that collectively they are far greater than the sum of their parts.  Beautifully filmed, with a stunning score by Philip Glass, Kundun tells the  story of the first few decades of the current Dalai Lama's life (from the  time he was recognized as a small boy, through his flight to exile in  India). What is extraordinary about Kundun is how much Scorsese is able to  tell by NOT telling it, or by relying upon almost miraculous imagery.  There are scenes in this movie that are absolutely breathtaking, and images  and events that will touch you deeply, and break your heart.
Kundun is  able to accomplish all this by creating a real sense of what the story  ""feels like"" rather than what it is about. Using a full cast of  Tibetans, including members of the Dalai Lama's own family, and gorgeous  locales, Scorsese truly lets you feel what it was like to be at every step  of the Dalai Lama's incredible journey. One can almost sink into the rich  tapestry of color and sense that the film weaves around it's subject.
If  you're looking for a movie with quick plot, fast action, and quaint or  curious characters, this movie is not for you.  If you're willing to let  yourself fall into the mood and world that Scorsese faithfully, and  astonishingly recreates, then this will be one cinematic event you will  never forget.",913593600,6,1476,4.665369649805448

953000,5,6305006571,"While Buddhism is often little more than an Orientalist fascination with many Americans, ""Kundun"" is one film, despite its hint of shangri-la reverence, which successfully depicts the core values of  Buddhism--nonviolence, compassion, discipline--in a truly positive way. A  far better film than the ambitious but ignorant ""Seven Years in  Tibet,"" this surprise wonder from Martin Scorsese  harmonizes a  breathtaking tapestry of art, color, and landscape with a soaring score by  composer Philip Glass. Although the Dalai Lama is not completely depicted  as an everyday man, the actors portraying him exhibit an infectious and  stoic charm. As a young Buddhist myself, I was touched by the film's many  observations of human life, and was moved to tears by the measured  depiction of Chinese cruelty against the Tibetans. Many lines are taken  directly from actual Buddhist prayers and are delivered with sincere  inspiration. Although the film may be difficult to follow for those  unfamiliar with Buddhisms core tenets, it is nonetheless a visual and  emotional experience. One need not know the symbolism of sand mandalas to  savor their image draping across the screen like bright rainbows. For those  who are curious to learn about the Dalai Lama, as well as the plight of the  Tibetan people, ""Kundun"" will no doubt be a worhthile and  unforgettable experience.",912384000,10,1368,5.313084112149533

953154,5,6305006571,"Kundun is a very interesting and informative movie about the fourteenth Dalai Lama. This movie does a great job of taking us through the early days in the life of Kundun, the God king of Tibet  before he was banished into India at the young age of twenty four. Martin Scorseses does a great job of showing the struggles of the Dalai Lama against a communist China. I thought that the chanting and rituals of fortune-telling were depicted very well and showed how in Tibet, the people of the city submissively got down on their hands and knees to bow to Kundun as they awaited his blessing. It really showed how they looked to him as their savior, the movie really made me feel that he gave them a lot of the hope and peace that they were seeking. Even though in the film he came across more as just a normal man and not necessarily a God, it is apparent that he is a really special person. Kundun, who is believed to be a reincarnation of Buddha, actually shows that while growing up, he also was subject to learning more as the teachers corrected and educated him. He is shown in the movie as a quiet, humble and gentle man who loves unconditionally. This film relates to world religion by giving a detailed view to those curious about Tibetan Buddhism. It is very enlightening and gives a breakdown of the Chinese invasion and the thoughts of the Dalai Lama. This movie helped relate a lot of the reading that I have studied about Buddhism over the past few months and is a memorable film. Overall I think that this movie did a great job of showing how Dalai Lamas are selected, the life and journey of Kundun and his time in Tibet before it was harshly taken over by China.",1491696000,,1676,4.389067524115756

953158,4,6305006571,"This is a movie about the 14th Dalai Lama who is the head of the Buddhist religion. It starts out in a remote area of Tibet close to the Chinese border. Kundun was a needy two year old boy who felt that everything was his. There were monks and others on a search for a little boy. When they enter the house of Kundun they notice his reaction to certain things. They give him the Dalai lama test and he chooses all the item correctly. They then notice that he is a spiritual leader.  Two years later he is taken to live with monks. There he is trained to be the official leader of Tibet. Later china invades Tibet and the Dalai lama flees. He is left with no other choice since he was practicing the ways of Buddhism. He started at a young age and didn't really understand how to take on something like that.
 I liked this movie because it explains the belief of reincarnation in the religion of Buddhism. The belief that the child at the beginning of the movie is reborn as the same man who was the Buddha of compassion, before the child was born, sets the tone of the film. I believe that the film had great imagery. The music and the images tied in well together, unfortunately it lacked in emotion and characterization. The use of nonprofessional actors took away from the film a little bit because they may not have particularly portrayed the person they were trying to be as well as they could have. Other than that the film was good and had some aspects of Buddhism that were depicted well. Kundun wasn't sure how to take on the challenge he was faced by the Chinese. He needed to defend his homeland while practicing the tenets of nonviolence. The portrayal of the 14th Dalai Lama's childhood and adolescence is unforgettable based upon the message about the courage it takes to comply with the Buddhist principle of nonviolence in the face of suffering and injustice.",1478995200,,1875,4.463556851311953

953244,5,6305006571,"A mesmerizing masterpiece! Another brilliant epic from five-time Academy Award nominated-Director: Martin Scorsese. Who, superbly illustrated on the big-screen the remarkable and absolutely incredible true story of Lhamo - whose name, means: ""The Protector"", who was thought to be - reborn... and subsequently, discovered by a Tibetan Monk, as a toddler, who... then went on to become the 14th Dalai Lama. The political and spiritual Leader of the people of Tibet. He..., through reincarnation, embodied the 'Buddha of Compassion' in human form. The KUNDUN. The exalted Dalai Lama and Supreme Head of all who practice Buddhism, worldwide. He is thought to be the epitome of an ""Ocean of Wisdom"" - as named, by the sons of Genghis Khan. This stunning cinematic spectacle is awesome to behold. Touchstone Pictures presents this Martin Scorsese Picture in widescreen, DVD format on this picturesque, color, single-disc, in Dolby Digital 5.1 Stereo with an approximate running time of 135 riveting, minutes. It vividly depicts how... from a far corner within the Nation of Tibet, a little boy was selected to lead an entire Nation and it's People - The Tibetans, who had practiced Buddhism and non-violence for a 1000 years. Who, together with a Regant, Buddhist Monks and a People that literally worshipped him, attending to his every wish along side his nurturing, education and monastic upbringing, the 14-time reincarnated, Dalai Lama - the KUNDUN himself, at a mere 18 years old was officially enthroned on November 17, 1950. Symbolizing that Buddha has yet again, graced his people by being, reborn. However, his search for enlightenment, truth and understanding, as when one continuously reincarnated soul... ascribes to reach during ones quest towards Nirvana, was tempered and encroached upon by hostile political rivals and geographic neighbors, who followed the Communist agenda. Specifically believing, that religion and all forms of worship, is ""...poison..."" and an opiad to the minds of the people. This powerful epic film is as historical and educational, as it is, entertaining. It seemingly magnetizes the audience from the on-set. It is an absolutely superb motion picture that portrays the true story of a rags to riches spiritual ascension and the struggle to hold on too that attainment and enlightenment.

953248,5,6305006571,"This movie is taken from Tibet, where a 2 year old boy has been described as the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion. He is visited by some men searching for the Dalai Lama so he undergoes testing to identify him as the reborn Lama.  His destiny is to become a political and spiritual leader of all the people. The Buddha of Compassion is also known as the Dalai Lama.  The 1st Dalai Lama was called Kundun.

The young boy grows up but goes through a rebellious streak. But after he grows into a man, he is prepared to take on a leadership role. After he turns 14 and begins his religious leadership role, his homeland is invaded by the Chinese army. The Chinese are initially helpful, but when the people of Tibet resist communist reorganization, the Chinese become oppressive. He makes a statement as too,  What can I do, I am just a boy.
After the Chinese invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama learns that they want to kill him, then he flees to India.  By hum fleeing, this was a historic moment. It kept alive the unique identity of the people in Tibet and in the world. Upon his return, Dalai Lama learned of much more oppressions by china. The Dalai Lama becomes ill and has several experiences of the past and the future. He eventually became the epitome of non-violence. He was a man who practiced what he preached.

This movie portrays the religion of Buddhism. Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to the insight into the true reality. They practice meditation that is a means of changing yourself in order to develop qualities of awareness, kindness, and wisdom. Their basic teachings are nothing is fixed or permanent. Buddha believes in the four noble truths.",1460764800,3,1708,4.62046204620462
953249,4,6305006571,"The film opens in Tibet in 1937, four years after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, as monks find a young boy whom they sense may be their reincarnated leader. In one of the film's most charming scenes, they place the child in front of an array of objects, some belonging to the 13th, some not, and he picks out the right ones, childishly saying, ""Mine! Mine! Mine!"" Two years later, the monks come to take the child to live with them and take his place in history. The child peers out at his visitors through the loose weave of a scarf and sits under a monk's red cloak as the man tells him, ""You have chosen to be born again."" At his summer palace, he sees dogs, peacocks, deer and fish. He is given a movie projector, on which a few years later he sees the awful vision of Hiroshima. Soon the Chinese are invading Tibet, and he is faced with the challenge of defending his homeland while practicing the tenets of nonviolence. There is a meeting with Chairman Mao, at which the Dalai Lama hears that religion is dead. The Dalai Lama can no longer look in the eyes of a man who says such a thing, focusing instead on Mao's polished Western shoes, which seem to symbolize the loss of older ways and values. The film is made of episodes, not a plot. It is like illustrations bound into the book of a life. Most of the actors, I understand, are real Tibetan Buddhists, and their serenity in many scenes casts a spell. The sets, the fabrics and floor and wall coverings, the richness of metals and colors, all place them within a tabernacle of their faith. But at the end I felt curiously unfulfilled; the thing about a faith built on reincarnation is that we are always looking only at a tiny part of it, and the destiny of an individual is froth on the wave of history. Those values are better for religion than for cinema, which hungers for story and character.",1460246400,,1861,4.350574712643678
953297,5,6305006571,"Kundun stands out to be influential as compared to other epic biographical films of the past and present generations. It is a movie that was directed by the famous Martin Scorsese and produced by Barbara De Fina. The writer of this historical movie, Melissa Mathison, deserves praises because he was success in portraying how various social-religious factors affected people in the past. Despite it being released in 1997, the film brings to light the activities of the period between 1937 and 1959 with a background setting of Tibet. The purpose of this paper is to review this movie and highlight how it is related to religion.
This movie begins with a searching mission where Tibet representatives are sent to look for a small boy perceived to be the 14th mind-stream emanation of their religious and political leader. The search turns out successful when the small boy, Tenzin Yeshi Paichang, and his family accept to move to Potala Palace that was situated in Lhasa. However, the China government was determined to extend its boundaries to the Tibet territories with their communist ideology. At this point of the movie any viewer gets to understand the significance of the Dalai Lama who travels to Beijing to present the pleas of his people to the Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong. The alliance of other anti-communists such as the United Kingdom, India and United States was null and void because they neglected the weak Tibet people at a time when they needed them most.
This movie reveals a lot of aspects connected to social, political and religious forces. Religion can be defined as the act of believing on super natural forces that are fundamental in helping the lives of the people involved (Basarab, 2013). Just to mention, diverse people have controversial opinions over religious matters in accordance to what they believe in. This movie relates to the religions of the world in many ways. The fact that the Tibet people are willing to do anything in their power to safeguard their religion is enough to reflect the magnitude in which people around the world value their respective religious groups and believes (Gerhards, 2007). However, controversies revolving religion can be seen when Mao Zedong makes a comment to undermine the Tibetans Religious believes. According to Mao, religion was poisonous and it had made the Tibetans weak and inferior in many ways.
In summary, Kundun is a very interesting movie worth the praises it attained immediately it was released. It exposes different community setups where diverse cultural and religious beliefs are embraced. This movie echoes the kind of life the people that lived in the medieval epoch experience. Furthermore, it evaluates how various religious beliefs have developed over the years to attain global status that cannot be sidelined at any given time in the current generation.",1460246400,,2850,5.0918803418803416

953304,3,6305006571,"Kundun
 The movie Kundun, is a movie based on Buddhism faith, is centered on a little boy who is born in 1935 in Tibet. In the beginning of the movie the two year old boy seemed to love hearing stories of his birth. It was said that when he was born there were two black crows circling in the sky (crows are often associated with the presence of gods or goddesses). He loved hearing the stories over and over again. Monks traveled to his town and he told a monk, who was wearing a Rosary, that it belonged to him. The monks then went to his home and he was able identify items which belonged to the 13th Delia Lama, he was then enthroned at the young age of five years old. Even though he was the reincarnation of the 13th Delia Lama he had to relearn practices and teachings of the Buddhist faith and gain enlightenment. The 14th Delia Lama was taught and protected by his teachers and reagents as he learned and practiced. There was an uprising in China, the Chinese government wanted to gain control of Tibet and the territory, as it was once part of China. The communist China moved in on Tibet and the young Delia Lama had to start ruling before he was ready or before gaining enlightenment. He was in consonant turmoil on which way to turn, his reagent suggested he leave Tibet and head to India; however, he refused this idea. He meet with the head of China and came to agreement, the terms of this agreement was not followed and was broken by the China government. The people of Tibet were being made to deny their religion. Ultimately, the Delia Lama was no longer in agreement with these terms, and he was no longer safe. He had to leave his people and head to India, where he would be safe.
 I have studied Buddhism in a World Religion class and was able to relate to many references within the movie. For example, they spoke about Dharma, The Four Noble Truths, and gaining enlightenment. Also, in Buddhism there is not a god that is worshiped, as the people look to the Buddha more for their teachings and helpings them gain enlightenment. There are many differences that I notice as compared to the time of Siddhartha, the first Buddha, as my World Religion classes teaches. There are many icons and temples, and Siddhartha believed everyone should be equal. One part of the movie I found interesting, the women had to be out of the temple after dark. Overall, I recommend this movie.",1447372800,,2398,4.460136674259681

Once again politics proves to be the poisonous viper in the world tree. When Tibet needed aid while the Chinese under Mao attacked and overtook their country, no one would help because there was nothing of interest to anyone outside that c\would make it worthwhile. No oil, gems, nothing. So poor Tibet and the Dalai Lama specifically were being targeted, the people murdered in the streets, families forced to kill each other.

953466,5,6305006571,"The film title ""Kundun"" refers to the name given to the 14 Dalai Lamas of Tibet. Each was a young boy when selected, and then trained to be Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader. The present Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was forced to grow up quickly when Mao Zedong's forces took over mainland China in 1949. At first, Tenzin labored patiently to reconcile differences and forge an agreement with Mao's government over the status of Tibet. After a meeting with Mao, however, the Dalai Lama suspected that his days in Tibet were numbered. Although a gracious host, Mao made it a point to end their meeting with the following words, ""Before you leave, there is one thing you must know: Religion is poison. It ignores material progress and keeps people backwards. We have a new China now."" Although ""Kundun"" seems unusual for a Martin Scorsese effort, it need make no apologies. This fine movie highlights the spirituality and courage of the 14th Dalai Lama. He is a leader on the world stage, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize (1989), the (US) Congressional Gold Medal (2007), and the Templeton Prize (2012). Fr.

953500,4,6305006571,"As part of an assignment for one of my classes, I watched Kundun for the first time and I thought it was very good. The movie was released in 1998 and was written by Melissa Mathison and directed by Martin Scorsese. As many movie goers know, Scorsese is arguably the greatest director of all time so I was excited to be able to watch the film for the first time.

Although it is considered a masterpiece by many critics, Kundun is one of Scorseses lesser known films and begins in 1937 with the story of a 2  year old child who is recognized by his people to be the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of compassion. This child, named Tenzin Gyatso (real name), goes on to become the Dalai Lama who is both a spiritual and political leader of the people of Tibet.

The movie takes us through his early life through his eyes as he is taught by the most enlightened Buddhist Monk scholars as he prepares to lead his people. This particular time in history turns out to be one of the most challenging times that the nation of Tibet had ever seen.

After Tibet is invaded by China, the Dalai Lama is made to go into exile because he refuses to conform to many of the policies set for by the new ruling government. As a result, Kundun tells a unique story that in the face of tremendous political pressure, the Dalai Lama never wavered from his religion and stood firm with the Buddhists belief of non-violence even after being exiled by communist China in 1954 at the age of 24.

This story made me think a lot about our current political situation here in the United States. At every turn it seems that our politicians bend and break in the face of political pressure. Take the crisis at the crisis at the Mexico/Texas borders regarding waves and waves of illegal immigrant children entering this country. I believe that many lawmakers and politicians truly feel that this is wrong and really want to do something to fix the problem. Like turning those busses around and sending them back to their homeland. But due to political pressure, these so called Conservatives and some conservative leaning Democrats become spineless and are not willing to make the tough choices because their careers mean more to them that the security of this country does.

The Dalai Lama would not have broken his beliefs and would do what is right for his people regardless of the pressure and he would be truthful to the nation which is also severely lacking in our current administration as it has for the last several we have had here in the US",1404777600,,2522,4.519736842105263
953501,4,6305006571,"Kundun is a story of indomitable will and fervent religious commitment set against a spectacular physical backdrop and compelling world politics. It is the true story of Tenzin Gyatso, a boy from rural Tibet, destined to lead his people at one of the most challenging times in their history. Through the eyes and heart of Tenzin Gyatso, as he grows from boy to man and is prepared for leadership by the most enlightened Buddhist scholars, ""Kundun"" reveals a society that remained isolated from the West for centuries. Before he reaches maturity, the Dalai Lama is placed at the head of his small, undeveloped and very religious country. He must contend with the surging strength and territorial ambitions of China, a newly unified and invigorated great power. The boy is taken away to be trained by monks and scholars for his role as Tibet's spiritual and political leader. When the boy his teachers call Kundun reaches the age of 15 in 1950, his homeland is invaded by the Chinese Army of Chairman Mao Zedong. This crisis leads officials in the Tibetan government to bestow the Dalai Lama with temporal power in order to defeat the fears of the population. With the search for the 14th Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, ending when a young boy is able to identify the objects that belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama. That boy, Kundun, the re-incarnated Buddha of Compassion, is taken to a monastery in Lhasa and is instructed in the ways of the Buddhist religion.
Kundun recounts much more of his life, from his discovery at age two all the way to his flight into exile at age twenty-four (in 1959), to escape the tyranny of Mao. Kundun includes more mention of some of the basic teachings of Buddhism, such as the Four Noble Truths, the Dharma of impermanence, and the awakening of compassion. (World Religions 156-158). Kundun relates to Buddhism in the Quest for freedom where the Notion of the Middle way has been systematized. Through its history it showed that Buddhism has always had a unique ability to adapt any cultural context. Much versatility was fostered in the earliest teaching of Buddha when he insisted that wherever Buddhism is transplanted, local custom, convention, and religious observance should always be maintained. The Buddha taught that much of human suffering is rooted not only in our presumptions of ""how things are"" but also in our assumptions of ""who we are."" The Buddha declared that there are ""Three Marks of Existence -impermanence (Aniya), suffering (Duhkha), and no independent self or soul (atman) (pg156).

953506,5,6305006571,"Kundun is a biographical account and writing of the 14th Dalai Lama.
It begins by the mother of the small child telling him of the story of his birth using a mosaic. She tells him this story to show him how significant he is. The small child is eager to be a man. He wants to have his fathers place at the head of the table. His father conforms.
The Dalai Lama is born repeatedly. The council sends a search group each time the Dalai Lama passes. Each time they have been successful.
There has been an extensive search through all the lands off Tibet to find the Dalai lama. A monk disguised as a servant visited the child only 4 years old home. The nature of Buddhism, allowed the family to invite them in. The child, Kundun, desired the prayer beads from the servants neck saying that the strand was his. The servant agreed to give him the strand, if he could tell him who he was. The servant left with the bead strand in hand. At the age of 2, he was found by a wandering group of religious men who discovers who he is by placing several items that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama and several more that didn't to see which items the boy picks. He picks the right ones, and the boy was named the 14th Dalai Lama. The child was allowed to go to the Temple to live as the 14th Dahlia Lama. He continued to show that he was the Dalai Lama reincarnated for the 14th time. As he grew, he learned the ways of the Buddha. He was told by his followers, that he will ""soon have great responsibilities"", each time he wanted to grow up to fast. The child learns daily of his past life by the possessions that he has collected through the years.
 Some years later, before he was to become a man, Communist China raids Tibet. Kundun tries to stand up and keep Tibet independent. He is invited to make a treaty with China but still they invade causing him to leave his temple, but not after much convincing. He returns home because he feels that he must protect his people, saying that the people come first. Only to be forced out again by bombing and killing of his peaceful people. The Dalai Lama takes heed to the prophets account of the break in the war for a path to leave his precious Tibet. He designs a plan that gets him and some of the council out of Tibet. The journey was tedious over the mountain to India where he remains.
The teachings of Buddhism is related to this movie in the teachings of the Four Noble Truths. Kundun was the living Buddha of Compassion. The peaceful people of Tibet refused to fight because they do not hurt any living things.",1397347200,,2556,4.2809917355371905
953574,3,6305006571,"After the 1933 death of the 13th Dali Lama, a lama begins searching for the new incarnate of the Buddha of Compassion.  His search takes him to a small village in Tibet where he finds the 14th Dali Lama, a young boy named Lhamo who seems to have almost free reign over his house and family members, however also seems to possess mercy. He loves to hear his family tell the story of his birth and how he never cried. When telling the story of his birth, his family recalls that a pair of crows came to nest on the roof of the house at that moment and someone present states that this is just what had happened at the birth of the last Dali Lama. When Llahmo lays claim to the prayer beads that the servant has from the 13th Dali Lama the servant decides to test what other possessions of the 13th incarnation Llahmo claims as his own. A series of items are placed on a table in front of the boy and he is asked what is his. Llahmo picks items out, one by one, and puts them aside as his. Finally, he reaches his walking stick and the lamas present confirm their suspicion that Llahmo is able to pick out the possessions of the 13th Dali Lama because he is in fact the next reincarnation. Llamo and his family are then taken to Lhasa, for Llahmo to be educated and eventually assume his role as the next Dali Lama when he comes of age.

The movie then follows him as he becomes Dali Lama and ultimately takes control of the leadership, politically and spiritually, of the Tibetan people. At the same time, the communist revolution has taken hold in China, and Mao Zedong comes to power. The Chinese communists lay claim to Tibet as being part of China and they invade Tibet. The invasion takes a darker turn when the communists crack down on Tibetans as a response to their resistance of communist ideology.

The two leaders, the Dali Lama and Mao meet and for negotiations. The talks sour and when the Dali Lama returns to his homeland, he finds that China as indeed become more violent in their oppression of Tibet and that Tibetans in return, have begun fighting back. An oracle advises the Dali Lama to flee Tibet, and while doing so, he is pursued by the Chinese. However, he does eventually reach safety when he crosses the Indian border but he longs to return.

This movie is a great addition to a Worlds Religion class as it exposes students to some Buddhist beliefs. It also is useful in showing how modern ideologies are clashing with religious traditions in the modern world. By exposing students to this clash, they will be able to see how some religious traditions attempt to hold onto their beliefs while others might willingly undergo changes in order to assimilate.",1397260800,,2679,4.461224489795918
953575,5,6305006571,"Kundun is the story of the reincarnation of the fourteenth Dali lama. In the beginning the young boy, only two, catches the attention of a group of traveling monks who are searching for the Dali lama. The boy tells one monk that the beads around his neck are his and the monk agrees. He is later put in front of a test that had similar items and was asked to pick what was his. The two year old selected everything correctly and was found to be the next Dali Lama.
The monks took the young boy with them to the temple to teach him the way of the Buddha. Here he studies his duties in life and learned his place among the monks. When he reached the age of 14 Kundun had to make decisions for the people of Tibet when the Chinese invaded. Later the Dali Lama has to flee to India where he is plagued by visions of his people being slaughtered.
Kundun was viewed as the reincarnation of the Dali lama, this philosophy of samsara is important in Buddhism because it links all previous lives to one (Brodd, et al. 164). Meditation was one of the first experiences Kundun has when he is taken to the temple. The concept of meditation is important in Buddhism because it anchors awareness, moment to moment, to the immediate experience and thereby to allow consciousness to expand spontaneously beyond the minutiae of compulsive and restless thought (Brodd, et al. 176-177). During the young Dali Lamas monk training we see him being tested on several of the important teachings of Buddhism; the twelve link chain of causation, the four noble truths, and the noble eightfold path. These methods helped lead him through the Chinese invasion, his fathers death, and making the decision to leave Tibet and his people. All though he left he did have every intention of returning to Tibet but has not had a chance to do so.

953577,4,6305006571,"Kundun is a movie that depicts part of the life of the fourteenth Dali Lama. The movie starts in a small village in Tibet near the Chinese border where the Dali Lama as a three year old little boy lived with his parents, brothers, and sister.  He is portrayed as an opinionated young child who often demands things and his own way. The young Dali Lama loves to hear his family tell the story of his birth. He is discovered in his home village by a monk that presents him with multiple items of the previous Dali Lama. As he chooses one item of multiple pairs of similar items each that he chooses is the actual item of the previous Dali Lama, thus reaffirming the monks belief he is the Dali Lama reincarnated. The movie goes on to show how he was moved from his home village to a monastery, where he was taught the ways of the Buddha and the protocols of leading the Buddhist people of Tibet as the Dali Lama. He was shown as a young boy to be mischievous and inquisitive, yet insightful in his studies.  As the movie progressed it showed the tribulations that the young Dali Lama went through as the Chinese invaded Tibet. As a young man leading his people in religion as well as politics, the Dali Lama remained true to his people and country refusing to leave Tibet despite the dangers he faced.  The Dali Lama never gave into violence, yet his compliance with the Chinese did not prevent his people from suffering or dying due to their chosen religion.  The Dali Lamas struggle with the communist regime taking over Tibet caused him to relocate from monastery to monastery before ultimately having to escape to India.
 This film is about the life of the Dali Lama, a worshiped deity to the Buddhist people. The film shows many ways, ceremonies, and teachings of the Buddhist. As the film illustrates the events of the Dali Lamas life it shows colorful and insightful examples of the Buddhist way of life and traditions. The movie shows festivals in which the people dress up in traditional garments while singing and dancing in the streets. The film also shows the tradition of an oracle (person possessed by a spirit or God) informing the Dali Lama of the future and advise such as his advised route to India. The movie shows the monks and Dali Lama in meditation at the monastery, as well as the teachings the Dali Lama received from the monks. I believe the movie shows in great detail the traditions and ways of the Buddhist.",1392595200,,2434,4.5227272727272725

953624,3,6305006571,"The Story of the 14th Dalai Lama is about a boy they call Kundun that lived in Tibet.  The movie is based on the writings and life of the 14th Dalai Lama. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away the people were searching for the new reborn Dalai Lama.  There were men called ""lamas"" that were searching for him.
They had a test that they presented to the young boy named Tenzin Yeshi Paichang to see if he was indeed the incarnate of the Buddha. The test was simple, they had numerous items that had been owned by the previous Dalai Lama mixed in with other things that were not owned by him, and they asked the boy to tell them which items were his.  The boy correctly identified the items from the previous Dalai Lama.
The movie chronicles the life of the boy after he is identified as the new Dalai Lama.  The boy travels within Tibet being instructed in the ways of a monk as he grows and matures.  He is brought to Potala Palace in Lhasa.  When he comes of age he officially becomes the new Dalai Lama, after which he takes a more active role as a religious and governmental leader.

The Dalai Lama, however, is being extremely non-violent, so when the Chinese attack, he does nothing.  When some of the citizens rebel though, the Chinese become very oppressive and deadly.  The Dalai Lama has no option except to flee to another country to escape the Chinese.  He puts on a disguise and he and others slip away in the night and travels a long distance to India.  An ""oracle"", which I think acted possessed, showed him a safe path to travel to India.

The Dalai Lama never returned to Tibet, although, someday he would like to.  It hinted in the movie, that he had a vision that someday he would return safely to Tibet.

This movie correlates with my studies in World Religion and the study of Buddhism.  Although I think the life of a monk would never be a life I would want.
I would rate this movie a three because honestly I didn't see anyway that he earned his position.  He did not come off to me as being wise or a great leader or even one who meditated a lot like you would think of a Buddhist monk.",1381536000,,2109,4.287878787878788
953625,4,6305006571,"A powerful Martin Scorsese film set in Tibet prior to the Chinese invasion where the search is on for the 14th Dalai Lama.  In the Hindu religion when the 13th Dalai Lama died his spirit was reincarnated into a child but first they must find the child.  Once the child is located a test is performed to verify whether the spirit of the 13th Dalai Lama is present.  Items that the 13th Dalai Lama are placed on a table along with items that look similar and the child must be perfect with all of his selections to prove that he has been reincarnated.  If you have never believed in reincarnation this scene will definitely have you scratching your head wondering in amazement how this is possible.  The child is named Kundun and is elevated as the 14th Dalai Lama and must bring the Tibetans together.  Even though Tibet has a small army just like Gandhi both men believes in non violence.  The movie takes you from his childhood to adulthood and his transformation into a born leader of the Hindu people of Tibet.  The artistry in this movie is magnificent and the historical timeline is gripping.  Martin Scorsese is one of the best if not the best film makers in the industry and is able to show you how the Dalai Lama lived, in regards to what he ate, preached, dreamed, and how he guided his people.  Unfortunately after World War II the Chinese government was determined to take back Tibet and in October 1950, the People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet.  The Dalai Lama was still against violence and felt his country could still hold onto its independence.  In 1951, Tibetan representatives negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement which formalized China's sovereignty over the Tibetan people.  This became a crushing blow to Kundun and in 1959 secretly went into exile in India.

This movie relates to my World Religion class because of the belief of non-violence. This beleif helped shape both Buddhism and Hinduism religions.  In regards to the non-violent belief in Hinduism, it was guided by Gandhi during the British rule of India.  Both religions were also polytheism in that they believed in multiple deities or gods.",1381017600,,2132,4.768392370572207

953662,5,6305006571,"The movie Kundun revolves around the religion Hinduism. The movie is about an encounter between a monk and a young boy names, Tenzin Gyatso. Tenzin is the reincarnation of the Buddha Dalai Lama, ""Kundun"", which is love and compassion.  He was the child of a farming family. This is a major highlight of the religion of Hinduism, where they strongly believe in the reincarnation after death. The religion thinks that one will be reincarnated into another form of life, not necessarily human, one could be born again as an animal, plant, Buddha, etc. The Lamas provided a test for the young boy regarding previous possessions of the last Dalai Lama. After passing the test, they took the young boy and his family to Lhasa, where he quickly began teachings. At the age of five the young boy is taught important teachings on how to be a monk. He was recognized as an important leader and treasure as a young boy, who taught the rest that everyone is here to love all living things. At a very young age the boy is wise, wiser than most adults and becomes a very strong leader. The main conflict in the film is when the Chinese communists invade Tibet, and Kundun, whom at this point is a leader in the political government, takes actions. He soon learns that the Chinese are out to kill him, and his only option is to flee. The Dalai Lama and some of his supporters decide the best route options are to flee to India, so they disguise themselves completely and begin to their safe destination. Once in India he is asked by an on-goer if he is the Buddha, and he replies with the films most popular line, ""I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself."" And then the film ends with the words across the screen that the Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet, but he hopes one day to return from his journey. This is a perfect conclusion to the film, implying that Buddha is indeed reincarnated and is living in the presence.",1365984000,,1992,4.413043478260869
953663,4,6305006571,"This movie chronicles the life of the fourteenth Dali Lama from his discovery in a small village up until his exile to India in 1959.  After the death of the thirteenth Dali Lama the Regent of Tibet had a vision of where to find the next one.  The search party led to the small village where the boy lived with his family.  They stayed the night with the family during which time the boy and Regent played.  The Regent wore the rosary beads of the thirteenth Dali Lama hidden under his robe.  The boy found them and recognized them, saying mine.  Convinced that they had found the Dali Lama incarnate they later returned along with a formal delegation, and brought with them a number of articles, some of which had belonged to the previous Dali Lama.  During this test the boy recognized those articles belonging to the Dali Lama claiming that they were his.  The boy, now called Kundun, would go to the Kumbum monastery where he was separated from his family for the first time in his life.  Kundun was sad and lonely for his parents, but he was joined by his older brother which was helpful.  Also he was comforted by his teacher, an old monk who held Kundun inside his robes.  Eighteen months later Kundun, along with his family, made the trip to the palace where they would live.  There his education began in order to prepare him for his leadership.  In 1940 Kundun was officially established as the spiritual leader in Tibet.  In 1950, at fifteen, Kundun was notified that communist China was intending to invade Tibet.  Kundun was worried because he knew that their army of 8,500 was no match for China's army.  The people of Tibet were becoming concerned and they wanted Kundun to be awarded with full temporal power.  In his first official act as Dali Lama he granted amnesty to all prisoners and set them free.  On the precipice of war Kundun sent delegations to America, Nepal, and Great Britain to ask for assistance.  Another delegation was sent to China in hopes of being able to negotiate.  Kundun along with his advisors decided that he should move to southern Tibet.  While there he found out that America, Nepal and Great Britain refused to see his delegations, and the delegation sent to China was unable to reach any agreements.  In 1954 Kundun visited China for peace talks and he met briefly with Mao Zedong.  Unfortunately, they came to no resolution that would be beneficial for Tibet.  Concerns were rising for Kundun's safety and in 1959 the decision was made that he was to go into exile in India, and he remains there to this day.
This movie includes references of the Buddhists beliefs.  Several scenes exhibit ceremonies with beautiful costumes, dancing, and music, as well as demonstrate monks in prayer, in meditation, and chanting.  The Dali Lama said in the movie ""violence is never good"", which is a major teaching in Buddhism.",1365465600,,2862,4.6853707414829655
953664,4,6305006571,"Kundun is a movie that is rooted deep in the beliefs of Buddhism.  The intro title cars set up the background information very well, saying that the Dali Lama has died and a monk is on a journey to find the next one.  It very quickly moves to a mother narrating to her child the story of his birth.  Upon retelling this same story later at the dinner table, a visiting monk notes the similarities between the young boy's birth story and that of the Dali Lama.  This leads more monks to test him, laying out objects that belonged to the previous Dali Lama and seeing if he picks out the right ones.  Two years pass and the child is sent away to begin his training to fulfill his place as the reincarnation of the Dali Lama.
 A ceremony is held to present the young boy as the fourteenth Dali Lama.  His spiritual learning is shown throughout the next part of the movie.  The film then starts to slowly, but soon heavily discuss the problems in international relations between Tibet and China.  Though Tibet has independence, China believes that it should be a part of their country and are starting to do more than make noise about it.  The rest of the film is about the young Dali Lama coming of age and trying to decide what the right thing to do for the people of Tibet is.
 Tibet is known for Buddhism and this movie is immersed in Buddhist principles and history.  The main backbone of this movie is that the great spiritual leader of Buddhism, the Dali Lama, is reincarnated and must be found again, over and over.  Not only does this fit in with the reincarnation beliefs of Buddhism, but also of their view of life in cycles.  Through the movie, it is said a few times about the importance of peace for all living things, touching on vegetarianism.  One of the great conflicts of this movie is how the Dali Lama can balance his religious beliefs of nonviolence with the aggression of China.",1365206400,,1897,4.426512968299712
953665,5,6305006571,"In 1949 the Communists took over the mainland of China and by 1950 had solidified their hold on the previously independent Tibet. The Dalai Lama, after giving the political situation much thought, went along with his chief adviser and fled to India to form a government-in-exile--where he still resides today.
Director Martin Scorsese and screenplay writer Melissa Mathison present a sober and reverent portrait of the fourteenth Dalai Lama from his discovery in a small village in 1937 through his escape to India in 1959. In the opening section of the film, Tibetan monks give a two-year-old boy a series of tests. He proves to them that he is the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha of love and compassion. The boy is taken away to be trained by monks and scholars for his role as Tibet's spiritual and political leader.
When the boy his teachers call Kundun reaches the age of 15 in 1950, his homeland is invaded by the Chinese Army of Chairman Mao Zedong. This crisis leads officials in the Tibetan government to vest the Dalai Lama with temporal power in order to quell the fears of the populace. In a brief encounter with Mao, the young Tibetan leader recognizes that his society of spirit and nonviolence clashes with China's culture of materialism and militarism.
Kundun (which means ""Ocean of Wisdom"") this presentation of the childhood and adolescence of the fourteenth Dalai Lama is memorable mainly for its moral message about the courage it takes to adhere to the Buddhist principle of nonviolence in the face of so much suffering and injustice. The Dalai Lama is a true hero of peace.
I think in accordance to Religions of today, there is a lot to be learned. Especially the spirit of nonviolence. And with so much adversity right in your face today. Not to mention how hard is is sometimes to see someone mistreated and you really want to get involved. For the most part religions of today practice nonviolence, with the exception of one or two.",1362268800,,1964,4.813609467455621
953666,5,6305006571,"The movie starts off in the year of 1933 and takes place in Tibet. The thirteenth Dalai Lama had died not too long ago and the search for the fourteenth Dalai Lama was in order. A two year old boy is discovered by several lamas while playing outside. They believe he might be the next Dalai Lama and immediately involve the small boy in a test in which from several items, is told to select only the ones that belong to him. To their astonishment, he passes the test and two years later, along with his family, is brought to meet the one who discovered him. In order to comfort the boy, Reting, the regent of Tibet, tells him the story of the first Dalai Lama who came to be called Kundun. As the years progressed, Kundun matured and became wiser. Shortly after, Reting is imprisoned, which motivates Kundun to step up and write a letter to the president of the United States. News of Retings death along with the passing of Kunduns father comes as an unfortunate surprise to Kundun. Now in his teens, Kundun becomes aware of the fact that the Chinese have invaded. He releases all prisoners of the palace and immediately calls the west for help by sending delegations to India, America, and Great Britain, in efforts to help recognize Tibet as independent. Those countries unfortunately refuse to meet with Tibet's representatives, which leaves Tibet facing China alone. Kundun then meets with Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing and is told that changes must be made. After returning to Tibet, Dalai Lama is informed of the injustices against his people and is persuaded to flee in order to avoid falling into Chinese hands. He then begins his strenuous journey to India where he ends up residing for many years.",1362268800,,1709,4.662251655629139

The 1997 release of Kundun directed by Martin Scorseses and written by Melissa Mathison is about the life of the fourteenth Dalai Lama. This picture is a moving story of the Tibetan spiritual leader. The movie starts out with the early life of the boy, who will become the spiritual leader of the Tibetan Government. The story is a history lesson about the Tibetan struggle for independence from China. Tezin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama, was not found until four years after the death of the thirteenth Dalai Lama. He was taken to live with the Buddhist monks, who taught him the teachings of Buddha. Gyatso was schooled in the traditions of his office until November 17, 1950 when he was enthroned as the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. About this time China invaded Tibet and forced the Dalai Lama into accepting Chinese rule. After a failed revolt, the Dalai Lama fled into India; where he set up his government in exile.
This movie also shows how the Dalai Lama as a leader in the Buddhist religion. The Vajrayana of the Mahayana branch of Buddhism found in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim and Mongolia look to the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader. Lamas are spiritual teaches and work to help individual to find enlightenment. The Dalai Lama is the most holy and the leader of the sect. As with all Buddhist the Dalai Lama teaches that we are to live at peace with others. It is the goal of Buddhism to liberate all beings from pain and suffering. The Dalai Lama proved to be a man who practiced what he preached, when faced with being over taken by china he tried to work out a compromise he and his people could live with. When it became apparent that his life was in danger he left his homeland to seek refuge in India. There he has continued to teach non-violence and worked to liberate his county from China's rule. The Dalai Lama has shown the world that his faith is strong even in the face of certain death.
This movie did a great job of showing the Buddhist faith to the world. It is worth two hours of your time to watch it. This movie shows the non Buddhist world the kindness of this faith. It brings to light the plight of the Tibetan people and their fight to free their county from an outside power ruling over them. Take the time and learn something new by watching Kundun a great movie that will inspire and uplift you.

His recognition begins in 1937 and ends in 1959 when he separates from his homeland at age 24. This is an actual story of Tenzin Gyatso, who is a boy from Tibet and is meant to lead his people in challenging times. He left Tibet because of the invasion of China on India. The Tibetans practice Buddhism and believe that their spiritual leader who is known as Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is supposed to be the same person that is reborn again and again so that Tibet can benefit from that same person. In order to find the next leader, the monks go out and search homes to find him. They found items that were similar to the previous leader, such as a walking stick and a food bowl and recognized him as the next leader. The little boy was taken to a palace in Lhasa in Tibet and this is where he would basically be trained and educated to be the fourteenth leader. He was to stay away from his family and his family were recompensed to live a high rich life. Before he actually came into power, China invaded and claimed that Tibet was part of China. The new leader was told to leave but he stayed to help and be with his people. He wanted to stay and protect his people and not leave them during hard times. Although the Chinese generals were not as cruel as thought out to be, which shows that there are different ways of being evil and monstrous.

It shows his life and how he evolved as a Buddhist till the age of 14, after which China invaded Tibet. You can already tell, that by this time, young Tenzin Gyatso had already developed strong opinions and wanted to be a more prominent part of the decisions that were made in the Buddhist community. After China attacked Tibet, he tried to get help from the West, but his requests were in vain and he was left alone. Even through these tough times, however, he kept true to his Buddhist principles and still exercised his non-violent ideals.

The most interesting part of the movie for me, was the beginning, because it showed a young child trying to live while implementing Buddhist teachings. This gave us a good summary on the main buddhist rules that young Tenzin Gyatso had to live by. He wasn't always successful, obviously, as he was only two years old! This caused quite a stir since he was the Dalai Lama and had to teach others to do things that he himself didn't always do!",1352592000,,1166,4.398148148148148

This confirmed to the other lamas that this child was the one. He and his family were then taken to a palace in Lhasa. Reting tells the child the story about the first Dalai Lama, named Kundun.

953736,5,6305006571,"""Kundun"" is perhaps Scorsese's most masterful film. It uses the medium of film virtuosically to show both the way an exceptional but naughty young child grew into the towering spiritual and political leader who won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989. The cinematography is exquisite, the story is told with great finesse and sensitivity, and the historical facts are presented with impressive accuracy, right down to very minor details (even most of the costumes and props being appropriate to specific times and places).

In terms of historical context, Scorsese's ""Kundun"" does an admirable job of telling the plain truth that old Tibet that the 14th Dalai Lama found himself ruling at age 16 was neither a spiritual utopia nor a uniformly authoritarian state, but rather a unique and complex collision of the lightest of the light and the darkest of the dark. And that's one of the facts that makes the historical backdrop of the story so interesting: Tibet in the 1950s (before the Dalai Lama came to power) was neither all saintly nor all devilish, but rather a fascinating mix of exceptional wisdom and the same mundane political intrigues one finds in any government. In that context, the story of Kundun follows the young Dalai Lama as he begins to become wise to the shadowy side of the old Tibet and embarks on a path to transform it. And, of course, one of the great tragedies is that, not long after the promising young Dalai Lama came to power and began instituting much-needed reforms in Tibet, that's when Mao's army rolled in the tanks... and from there the rest of the fascinating, true-to-life story unfolds. All of this is portrayed brilliantly by Scorsese in the film, though to appreciate fully the richness and complexity of the story requires the viewer to watch in an engaged and thoughtful way (rather than taking it in passively as ""entertainment""). Understanding can also be aided greatly by reading the Dalai Lama's autobiography, Freedom in Exile, which is a must-read for anyone interested in Tibet or the life of the Dalai Lama.

953741,4,6305006571,"There are many gorgeous shots in Kundun, Martin Scorsese's meditative drama about the youth and early adulthood of the Dalai Lama, the messianic spiritual leader of Tibet. The landscape, with its arched snowy peaks and palaces etched into the earth, is almost lunar in its crystalline aridity, and Scorsese does eerie justice to the forbidding beauty of it all. What the movie doesn't have is visual flow. The images are hermetic, almost literally pieced together; it's hard to forget that you're watching officially splendid cinematography.

Kundun is at once spectacular and inert--a mosaic impersonating a movie. As the story progresses from the '30s through the '50s, with the Dalai Lama played by one actor, then another, then another still, we're denied a sense of how his temperament as an individual played against the demands of his pedestal. The great achievement of Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ was the way it dramatized Jesus as man and deity. The director grasped the startling theatrical conflict in that duality. But Scorsese, lost in an outsider's empathy for Tibet and its struggles, never gets close to the conflict at the heart of Buddhism--the acknowledgement that life is ''suffering'' because its sensual demands can't be truly fulfilled. There's precious little sensuality in Kundun. Like Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (also the vision of an Italian Catholic), it's an empty-shell epic, a Western sinner's pious ode to the decorousness of Eastern mysticism. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, who plays the Dalai Lama as an adult, is as cold and impassive as a Harvard preppie--he doesn't show a trace of the real Dalai Lama's sneaky joy--and when he finally meets Mao Zedong (Robert Lin), the dictator who is seeking to destroy his country, the supreme mass murderer of the 20th century just seems an effete clown. Scorsese has taken the harsh mystery out of Tibetan Buddhism, and out of its oppression, too. The Buddha, based on his own experience, realized that each one of us has the capacity to purify the mind, develop infinite love and compassion and perfect understanding, and through meditation find solutions to all our problems. Buddhism does not force preset ideas on you, and furthermore all other religions are tolerated. By showing respect for another person's religion, a Buddhist demonstrates the confidence he has in the strength of his own religion.",1332028800,,2392,5.196891191709844
953742,5,6305006571,"This film provided great insight into the life of the fourteenth Dalai Lama.  He was discovered in Tibet when he was just a small boy.  Two years later, he went to the monastery to begin learning the ways of life.  One scene that stood out for me was when he said, ""My teeth are in there.""  He was speaking as the thirteenth Dalai Lama, and they did indeed find his teeth wrapped in cloth in the cabinet that he pointed out.  He was faced with many difficult decisions at a young age.  China wanted Tibet to be a part of them and no longer an independent country.  He did whatever he could to remain peaceful and keep his people peaceful.  He did not want to flee and wanted to remain by his peoples' side.  He ultimately had to flee to India and had yet to be able to return to Tibet.
This film relates to World Religions because it primarily features Buddhism.  We see him learning the teachings and often hear him reciting their beliefs. We see many monks working in this film.  We also see him saving animals, mainly sheep, whenever possible. At the beginning as a young boy, we see him pull two bugs who are fighting apart and separate them to save their lives.  We see rituals take place, such as dancing in masks.  We also see the ritual where one elder dresses up and seems to be relaying the message from another spirit.  They believe in reincarnation, as they found the thirteenth Dalai Lama in the young boy who became the fourteenth Dalai Lama.
This movie was truly inspirational and educational.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.  I would definitely recommend this movie to others.  I was amazed at how they were able to find this young boy at such a young age and be sure that he was the Dalai Lama.  He was able to pick out all the past Dalai Lama's things with little hesitation.",1330646400,,1805,4.36936936936937
953783,5,6305006571,"I was one of those very skeptical movie fans who didn't believe Scorsese could make a biographical film about the Dalai Lama and be successful.  I had also seen Bertolucci's Little Buddha and wasn't that impressed.  That film came out close to the time of this movie.  Still this film turned out beautifully and it is so quiet and sweet that a viewer doesn't recognize how successful the film is until the end.  Scorsese actually used Tibetan actors in making this film and doesn't let the idea that all are speaking English interfere with the story.  It seems natural and not odd.  A young boy in a distant part of Tibet in 1933 is found to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and is taken to Lhasa for education.  The training is gentle though there is a boy who is a whipping boy if the young Dalai Lama is naughty.  His parents are allowed to live with him and life for the most part is presented as welcoming and respectful.  Bad conditions are pointed out such as prisons and soldiers and his teacher at one point is arrested and imprisoned.  When he asks to see the teacher, the teacher suddenly dies without explanation.  Spared from most of WWII bad effects, the kingdom is rocked by a freedom movement in India and a communist revolution in China.  The Chinese invade and it appears to the Dalai Lama that there is no middle ground with the invaders.  Monestaries are destroyed, people are killed and monks humiliated.  The determination of Mao to destroy religion doesn't accept the idea of Tibetan Buddhism as a main part of Tibetan culture. Finally the Dalai Lama is forced to run into India for safety, probably never to return.  Scorsese takes the story slow and quietly as Tibetan Buddhism is often represented.  Non violence is respected and violence isn't shown.  Very appropriate for the film and I remember on first seeing it how wonderful the approach was.  It holds up.

953784,4,6305006571,"The movie is a very educational and interesting movie it starts basically with a two year old child is born and there is search for the 14th Dalai Lama. This is the year of 1937 in an area of Tibet, close to the Chinese border. The film goes into his childhood where this little boy is said to be the reincarnation of the one and only Buddha. The film portrayed the young boy proving that he was Kundun reincarnated. A couple years pass by and he is bought to Lhasa where he is schooled as a monk. The film shows Kundun with an aggressive communist China. When he is 14 the Chinese invade Tibet. He is forced into a treaty. The film also continues into his adulthood where he travels to China and finally in 1959 ill and under siege flees to India.
My favorite part of the movie is this part where the Dalai Lama is leaving Tibet, getting into a boat that will commence his journey to refuge in India. The moon has backlit on an impressive mountain range, beyond the water's edge, and there are still stars visible in the sky. As the boat drifts off, it looks like the Dalia Lama is floating into the stars beyond the mountains. This part of the movie was very interesting and beautiful.
How this movie relates to religion is from the things I have learned about the religion of Buddhism, this movie represents them well. The movie shows the importance of rituals and practices of the Buddhist religion. The Dalai Lama is an inspirational human being and leader. The movie also shows monks at work and overall if you don't know anything about the religion you will after you watch this movie.

953785,5,6305006571,"Martin Scorcese's movie Kundun is a visually stunning film about the life of the fourteenth Dali Lama. Four years after the death of the thirteenth Dali Lama, a young boy is discovered to be the next incarnation of his holiness. While a typical child in many respects, he displays qualities uncharacteristic of most ordinary children.
 Once the new Dali Lama is discovered he is embraced by the monks and taught the ways of Buddhism. He proves to be the one as he displays profound wisdom beyond his years. As the Dali Lama grows from a child to a young man many of his teachers pass away and he is the one everyone seeks answers from. This proves to be a struggle for a young man with so little worldly experience. It is not an impossible task though because he has the knowledge of the four noble truths of Buddhism and has the integrity of a truly righteous person of peace.
The film gives us a glimpse into the oppression of Tibet by a communist China, after World War II. The Chinese government, led by Mao Tse Tung, has decided to invade Tibet and force its ways onto the people. Oppression is disguised as needed progression. We see the desperation and horror of the Tibetan people caused by the oppressive Mao regime and its manipulative ways with the propaganda they produce for the world and the conquering of a peaceful country of Buddhist people.
Despite his life being at risk, the Dali Lama refuses to flee his country because he is so concerned with the Tibetan people. Even as the Chinese begin to invade and bomb his country he insist on staying, for he is more concerned with the torment of everyone else rather than the risk of his own death. The communist make attempts on his life, even trying to convince his own brother to kill him if he does not agree to sign the seventeen point agreement giving China full control of Tibet. Eventually his advisors and followers convince him to flee to India because the future of the Tibetan country rests with him and everyone tells him that if he dies the country dies with him.
He makes the long, rigorous journey with the help of a few of his people and eventually makes it to the safe haven of India, where he is welcomed by the border soldiers. When asked if he is the Buddha he displays humble wisdom by responding that he is a reflection and when you see me see the goodness in yourself. This is a good example of the Buddhist's philosophical approach to a world full of doubt, uncertainty and suffering.
Another example of the Buddhist philosophies is how Kundun apparently buys sheep every time he crosses paths with a shepherd. He does this to keep them from being killed, out of compassion for all creatures.",1321747200,,2680,4.548654244306419

Tenzin Gyatso seems to have been a much loved; healthy little boy with a strong
character.  Then he was found and tested and recognized as the reincarnation
of the 13th Dalai Lama.

The movie explores his leaving the comfort of home for the comfort of
new teachers and friends. Tenzin is forced to grow up fast to become the Head of State
at age 15; 3 years earlier than usual, due to political pressures from
China.  The Dalai Lama escapes Tibet as the country is overrun by Mao Zedong's
army.

It feels sad; until one realizes that Zedong, in his efforts to destroy
Buddhism (he tells the young Dalai Lama that ""religion is poison""), he has
actually helped spread the knowledge and practice of Tibetan Buddhism from the
tiny country to all over the globe.  This hopefully balances out the sacrifice
of so many Tibetans.  And according to Reincarnation:  'they'll be back'.",1319155200,,946,4.662650602409639

He is then taken from his home to be raised and taught by only the most respected monks around. While he is with them he proves he is the 14th Dalai Lama by knowing things about the life of the 13th Dalai Lama he shouldn't know about. All of this is going on about the time of the end of WWII. He learns of the war through old film movies, news papers, and the radio. China once had the understanding with Tibet that they were each their own country but China's new leader decides that Tibet is part of their empire and wants them to surrender to their control. As the movie  progresses you see how the Dalai Lama deals with the encroaching Chinese army but always keeps to the rule of non-violence. He sends out many pleas of help to different countries but to no avail. With the army approaching the Dalai Lama then listens to the advice of his elders and decides to flee Tibet. He flees to India where he is still located today and dreams of his return to Tibet.

953789,4,6305006571,"Kundun

The movie Kundun was an interesting movie that showed people the realness of Tibet and its culture. It is a movie that depicts realness and sincerity. The most extraordinary thing that I found about this movie was the honesty and navet. It seems like the movie was told through the eyes of someone that understood the simplicity of the situations. The Dali Lama was played by more than one person. At one point of the movie, I think the most interesting part, was when he saw himself standing in the midst of all the monks that were dead. It felt very real and there were different emotions brought forth because of that. At that point, it had nothing to do with religion to me, it was just that it was people laying there in front of him dead. Any person that experiences real human emotions should have felt something from that scene.
 I think that the movie was well planned and thought out. The pictures were tasteful and tied in with the movie very well. The music was different than the genre that I am used to hearing. The dramatization of the characters was also pretty good. I did seem to like the characters of the movie that were or seemed to be American better than the actors that did not seem American, but I felt it was necessary to put the point across. I do understand more about the society as a whole better now, but I wish that the only venue could be more than a movie to keep me interested. I do not understand some things that were in the movie, but it was not that it was not clear; it was because I am of a different religion. I do love that the values that they upheld.
This movie relates to world religions because it shows how a culture or a religion operates and how it is present and not really that known of.",1303603200,,1747,4.306990881458966
953790,5,6305006571,"This film captures events, times and a culture which has been decimated. Concepts often not well understood or dismissed without examination are made clear to those of us whose minds might be uninformed or shut against cultural differences. The visuals and soundtrack are stunning. The story is not a story. It is a modern cinematic reflection of the truth.

It is said and it is accurately spoken: the Tibetans are much like the Native Americans were when the pilgrims landed. You may disagree with the customs of an indigenous people, but truly it is not just of another culture to trespass, kill the people, pervert their culture, steal what is precious to them, destroy their homeland in the name of communism or christianity or convenience. It is astonishing that America did not care and still seems unwilling to become involved. If there was an exploitable resource like oil in Tibet, you know America would have been sending in troops to defend the Tibetans decades ago. And in so doing, less people may have died but the culture would still have been contaminated. In life, happy endings and wonderful results are more often the exception rather than the rule.

Kundun affirms the fact of reincarnation, shows that Buddhism is more about learning and work than it is about religion. One simply does not enter a designated building one day per week, talk to an unknowable someone separate from themselves in order to be absolved of all wrong-doings. In Tibet, each spiritual person takes responsibility for their actions and works to be kind and compassionate to all. Anger, greed and foolishness are to be understood, evolved beyond and avoided if at all possible. And it is truly up to each person to conduct their lives with a minimum of idiocy and quite lot of nobility and self-control. This can in no way be compared to the simplistic concept of ""turning the other cheek"" when slapped.

The film shows a far more intelligent funeral ceremony which would likely shock many Americans: we each take so much from the food chain and so it is proper that we are returned to the food chain. There is ceremony, but not of sadness. The funeral industry in our country is a high ticket farce. When I leave the body, the lights will be off and no one will be home. As long as I did not die of some horrific communicable disease, why shouldn't the carrion eaters enjoy a well-deserved meal? Why would I want to be under six feet of dirt in a sealed box or burned to ashes and put into a decorative jar?

To be Dalai Lama is not trivial, as this spirit will return again and again to lead the people. It is not as though there is a simple or straightforward way off the wheel. Ah, but an evolved spirit might choose not to return if it meant risk to the lives of the loyal people who remain.

It is not to turn one's back on wealth or position or privilege that is important, but the love of one's land and people and the safety of same that matters. Emotion *is* expressed in Kundun. And the visions of the Dalai Lama came to pass. The man represents hope and attaining a beauty of mind to which others aspire. He did not leave easily, happily or with a sense of relief. In Tibetan Buddhism, the country is the man and the man is the country and the creation of boundaries, of ""us versus them"" is a bizarre and flawed way of thinking. And so peaceful people must learn to defend themselves ""against"" a self-described enemy who uses the age-old lie of The Religious War to do what is simply this: grab land and whatever looks like a treasure for reasons of greed and acquisition.

Martin Scorcese created a very different masterpiece in Kundun. He told the truth to a world that has in great part been unwilling to listen. He demonstrated a deep understanding of how emotion is and is not expressed in Tibetan culture. I recommend this film as one that is both brilliant and loving, from a man whose character is deep, intensely diverse and fearless.",1300752000,4,3951,4.589235127478753

953862,5,6305006571,"KUNDUN is Martin Scorsese's grandly episodic biographical film of the life and times of Tenzin Gyatso, the XIV Dalai Lama, the ""Kundun"" of the title. Although Mr. Scorsese is best known for his gangster epics MEAN STREETS, GOODFELLAS and CASINO and for studies in violence such as RAGING BULL and TAXI DRIVER, his films can all be seen as studies in the condition of the human individual (AVIATOR), and how that individual comes to terms with the Spirit within himself (THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST and KUNDUN).

KUNDUN is unique among Scorsese's films for lacking an A-List lead, and is in fact unique among films as the ""authorized biography"" of its subject. The XIV Dalai Lama was intimately involved in the making of this film, and most of the sequences in KUNDUN were drawn from his living memory. The actors in KUNDUN are the Dalai Lama's niece (as his own mother) and his grandnephew (as himself), and while the acting is unpolished it is heartrendingly sincere.

From the time he is discovered to be the reincarnation of the XIII Dalai Lama, Kundun's life is strictly proscribed. A sweet, precocious little boy whose compassionate nature makes him pet puppies and separate fighting beetles, he is taken away from Takster, his home town in Amdo Province, and brought to Lhasa, where he grows up within the ""old and dark"" walls of the Dalai Lama's vast and ancient Palace, the Potala. Although his upbringing among adult monks seems sad and drear and he admits to loneliness, his is also a life of great pomp and circumstance. As the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Kundun is both indulged and delimited in his choices. Among the gold statues and rich silks, rats are seen to scurry hither and yon, even while the eldest greybeards prostrate themselves before him. Although he does show a few youthful inclinations toward arbitrariness, he outgrows these quickly. Interestingly, Heinrich Harrer, His Holiness' adult friend who introduces him to the West (and is the narrator and chief character of SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET) never appears in KUNDUN (both movies were released in 1997; the cast and crews of both pictures were forever banned from China for making these films).

A curious boy, he wants to know how things work, where places are, and what the politics of his kingdom portend. Although he is shielded somewhat from the harsher realities of life, circumstance dictates that he assume the mantle of power in youth. China, long having claimed Tibet as its own territory, falls to the Reds, who quickly occupy Tibet and begin the slow extermination of the Tibetan language, culture, religion, and people. Although His Holiness first attempts a policy of peaceful coexistence with Beijing, he is advised rudely by Mao-Tse-Tung that ""Religion is poison."" Shortly thereafter, the Beijing government begins killing monks, destroying monasteries, and uprooting native Tibetans. Although he at first refuses to flee Tibet, a transparent Chinese plot to have him killed convinces his advisors that the Dalai Lama must lead from exile. And so he has, from 1959 to this day.

KUNDUN is richly textured, deeply moving, and emotionally intense. It captures an almost-extinct Tibetan culture rich in color and ritual and spiritual depth. If the viewer allows him or herself to practice compassion by stepping into the Dalai Lama's place, then KUNDUN is a movie that can be life-altering.",1291334400,4,3420,5.058510638297872
953863,4,6305006571,"This is one of Martin Scorcese's good film, I wouldn't say one of his bests films. The movie Kundan was a beautiful movie. This movie takes place back in 1937, where Dalai Lama is a character who goes from the ages two, five, and twelve, to fifteen years of age.  He was stated to be the fourteenth reincarnation of the compassion Buddhism. This character lives in Tibet a distant village. He is taken away from his home to be turned into a leader. He is trained as a monk and he studies the war. We watch him in the movie while he grows up into a young man.  All Dalai wanted was to protect his people while in Tibet and to gain his people back their freedom. He then is exiled and he is trying to save his life. Dalai was portrayed as someone who could not do any wrong and he was basically flawless. I questioned myself how they would allow Dalai Lama as a little boy to rule over his people. Dalai Lama grew into a man and matured very fast. This film did describe the life of a Buddhist. I did struggle through understanding the concepts with Tibet and China. Dalai's role was to confront China's rule. However, in this movie you learn about the history of Tibet and the connection with the country China. This film had very harsh reviews; however, I found the movie to be a bit interesting. In the end, Dalai was forced to seek refuge in India and to flee from Tibet for good. The theme of the movie relates back to the World Religions of Buddhism that they believe in non-violence. This movie states that Dalai's message was to create peace and prevent violence. I think that this movie did display how Dalai was able to use his religion to help him rule and fight for his people. I would give this movie four stars.",1290297600,,1723,4.314814814814815

The story of the child who was chosen to be the believed reincarnation of the last one, which was the 13th one, was just fascinating.

He was given this role as he passed a test as a small child, choosing the ""right items"" off a table in order to prove he was indeed worthy and the reincarnated Dali Lama that had been ever so missed. Then as he gets older, the reality of his life is really setting in, and he becomes homesick and scared - however once he is reminded about how he came to be this specific person with this very specific role, he is comforted.  He deals with many difficult tasks such as preventing China from taking over Tibbett.  He was somewhat even insulted by some of the Chinese officers, who were stating that Tibbett was at a handicap because of their religion, which is of the upmost importance there.  In the end, the Dali Lama must flee to India, as his life and family have been threatened.  He becomes very sick on the journey away from Tibbett.

953865,4,6305006571,"I thought overall Kundun was a good movie. This movie takes place mostly in Tibet and is about a young boy who becomes ""Dali Lama."" The people learned about a boy who was thought to be the next one. At a very young age the other lamas put him through a test to see if he could pick out objects that belonged to the Dali Lama before him. The boy passes the test and begins a journey earning his name Kundun. The boy continues to grow up throughout the movie and starts to become more participated in his leadership. Tibet begins to have issue with China, because they end up taking over and trying to force communism on Tibet. Many people suffered with these conflicts and Dali Lama meets with the chairman in China. Things continue going wrong over in Tibet and the Chinese end up wanting to kill him. Dali Lamas family convince him to escape and go to India so he speaks with the oracle to find out which way he should go. He and his posse disguise themselves and make way to India. They finally make it to the Inidian mountains and at the end of the movie he announces that he sees himself as a reflection of Buddha. This movie related to my religion class because it pertained to Buddhism. Dali Dalai Lama is a Buddhist leader that is in Tibet. We talked about all different countries where Buddhism is practiced, with Tibet being one of them. Dali Lama also consist of rebirth which is another big part of the religion. We discussed this topic a lot in my religion class and it is something that is important to Buddhist. It has to go with having good karma which is basically achieved by doing good works.",1290211200,,1610,4.37

The movie certainly helps viewers understand the beauty, peacefulness, and introspection of Buddhism.

The story starts with Kundun as a young boy in a distant village in Tibet. He is taken from his parents in order to be groomed to be the Dalai Lama. He does his best to lead and exhibits all the traits of a Dalai Lama. He is a compassionate and respected leader. He is taught the ways of the religion that he is to lead, and then he is forced to confront the tyranny of Chinese rule. The Chinese are oppressive and abusive to the Tibetan people. He visits Chairman Mao and when he realizes that religion will never be accepted by the Chinese, he returns to his people only to have to flee to India to stay alive. The story of the Dalai Lama is inspiring and no matter what your faith is, anyone can appreciate the leadership and courage of Kundun. Although I liked the movie overall, I'm not sure this movie helps the viewer understand the complexities of the politics behind the Dalai Lama, the Chinese, and Tibet. Even today, I don't think people understand the heft of the Dalai Lama and how the entire nation of Tibet rests on this religious sect.

953867,4,6305006571,"The movie Kundun was released in 1997 amid much controversy. The Chinese government was very displeased with the movies portrayal of the takeover of Tibet. The movie itself is quite worth all the controversy. In my opinion, there are several `slow spots' but Kundun does a fantastic job of cinematically explaining the Buddhist religion and the belief in a true, living Dali Lama; a reincarnation of the compassion Buddha.
The movie begins in 1937 shortly after the death of the 13th Dali Lama. Buddhist monks find a young boy that they believe might be the reincarnation of their leader. There is one scene where the monks place several things in front of the young boy. Some are ""his"" (belonging to the 13th Dali Lama) and some are not. He correctly picks ""his"" things. Time passes and the Dali Lam must deal with the Chinese invasion while still practicing the Buddhist principal of non-violence. The Dali Lam is shown as being a perfect person and never seems to truly struggle with any negative ""human"" emotions, like hatred, in regards to the Chinese. We do see him seek help from several governments including India and the UK but even the United Nations refuse to get involved in the Tibetan cause. Even meeting with Chinese leaders is portrayed as a test for the Dali Lama but he seems to handle the choices so fluidly and with such peaceful resolve.
Buddhism is a very beautiful Eastern religion and this film introduces many of the basic beliefs such as the Triple Gem, Eightfold path and of course, the Four Noble truths. I usually prefer to watch actual documentaries when it comes to historical matters such as this because, of course, Mr. Scorsese and the writers chose to portray the characters in the light that they see fit and might have ""Hollywooded"" Tibet's plight just a bit too much. I do think that it important to expose Westerners to all the Eastern religions and if it takes Martian Scorsese film to do it then so be it.  Buddhism is not a religion that actively proselytes so introducing their beliefs of non-violence, reincarnation and peaceful, harmonious living is a welcome relief from some of the more violent movies that seem to do so well at the box office.",1289260800,,2192,4.753280839895013

Mr. Scorsese did a marvelous work with the actors which bring us these epics moments from 1937 to 1959 from the life of this great man that is the Dalai Lama.  A very important fact to know regarding this movie in my opinion is the reaction of China's leaders; they objected to the release of this movie so firmly that they threaten to remove all access to China market to Disney. Disney unlike Universal Pictures who had turn down the distribution of this movie in fear of these threats did not bend to China threat. Mr. Scorsese and several members of the production are prohibited to enter China as a result of making the movie.

Early in the movie the young actor interpreting Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, showed how pacifist he was by separating two scarabs that were fighting. He was discovered by a Lama who was seeking the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama base on the vision of Reting Rinpoche, the regent of Tibet. Following their discovery of the child the Lamas will test him, and then they will take him to Tibet capital. . Scared and homesick a Lama will calm the boy by telling him stories of the 1st Dalai Lama. He is named Kundun the 14th Dalai Lama reincarnation of the Buddha of compassion. For many years the will study the Buddhist way, the 4noble truth and the eightfold partway are mention in this movie. Studying for many years he will be face with hard decision as China political situation change greatly and start invading Tibet saying that Tibet is part of China and want to liberate the people from the imperialist oppressor and from the tyranny of the Dalai Lama. Kundun was denied help from the United Nation, England and India when he asked their help in this matter. Things seem to improve for a time under China occupation however things are not always as they seem to be. Kundun eventually meet with China leader whom ask him to join the government. Seeing how things really are under Chinese occupation Kundun is face with hard choices, remaining in Tibet and facing consequences that might cause him his life or flee to India and live as an exiled.

Knowing the fact that the Dalai Lama currently lives in northern India we all know what choice he made however I have told you so little of this movie I hope that my review of this movie gave you the desire to see it. It is the epic tale of one of the most known religious leader still alive today.

The book explains some of the things that you will see in ""Kundun"" which are not clearly explained in the film.

The lamas began to test the boy further to see if he could correctly identify items owned by the thirteenth Dalai Lama.  He was able to identify the walking stick, food bowl, and were he was from, which really impressed the lamas.  Llamo's mother would not let him keep any of the items, including the beads. In 1939, Llamo was taken to the massive palace called Potala located in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet where he was groomed and educated to be the fourteenth Dalai Lama.  His family were not allowed to join him, but were allowed to live the high life just like him.  China began to invade Tibet, before he could assume full responsibilities.  They claimed that Tibet had always been part of China and it was not really an annexation so much as bringing Tibet back to the bosom of the motherland.  Advisers urged Dalai Lama to flee the country while he still could, but he decided to return to be with his people.  He is asking for help from India, Britain, and America for the recognition of Tibet's independence from China.  Lama was told that India is in no condition to help and Britain will not help.  He decides to write a letter to the president of the United State, who was Harry Truman during this time period.  After his father's death, China is taken control by communism.  Tibet must accept being part of China, it's defenses must be conducted by China, and all political and trade must be conducted by China, since they plan to take over.

Lama is persuaded to exile before the Chinese capture him and destroy Tibet's future.  The Chinese are taken strict measures to prevent Lama from escaping and they plan to bomb Tibet.  Dalai Lama does not believe in war.  He manages to escape dressed in a soldiers uniform to India at night.  The movie ended with the statement that the Dalai Lama has not returned to Tibet, but hopes to one day make the journey back.

Tibetans practice Buddhism and believe that their head leader, the Dalai Lama, is a manifestation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion.  The Dalai Lama is really the same person being reborn again and again so that Tibet would benefit from his continued presence and rule.",1270771200,,2666,4.591966173361522

The only disappointment for me was the lack of special features on the disc. However, I believe there are documentary DVDs available that tell about the making of Kundun.
This is not for the casual movie viewer. But even if you don't have an interest in Buddhism or the plight of Tibet under Chinese rule, this film is still beautiful to watch and the culture is fascinating to observe.

It wasn't all that visual a film.  I expected more great cinematography.  It left me kinda confused about Tibet culture.  I think my favorite parts were the Dalai Lama's meetings with Chairman Mao.  You don't see much of that guy in films, yet he was such an interesting historical figure, in some ways, he kinda overshadows the Dalai Lama.  A far more interesting biographical film would have been about Mao Tse-Tung's life.  Seriously.  The movie falls flat trying to describe Buddhism, which is really a great way of understanding life.  Communism too, tries to explain life and that contrast would have been great but I think Disney was more interested in creating a movie that the Chinese communists would accept, than to really investigate these two great schools of thought, and how they compare and contrast.  In the end, I actually lost some respect for the Dalai Lama.  He abandonded his people.  A great charismatic Buddhist leader would not do this.",1268352000,,1138,4.83419689119171
953921,4,6305006571,"Kundun, though slow to start, was an intense, gripping-at-the-heart-strings movie that enters the world of Tibet and its Buddhist views. As a viewer, you watch the young Dalai Lama take his place as leader of Tibet, both secular and religious, in the midst of a Chinese overtake of their previously independent nation. The movie is based on a true story, which makes watching the story come out of the screen and play with your head, wondering how any young man could have began to deal with the trials and heartbreaks he endured with such grace. In this movie, you watch as the Dalai Lama takes on his role beginning as young as four years old, as the spiritual leaders of Tibet search for Kundun, the believed reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama. Through the movie, you see Kundun grow up into his role. His innocence and curiosity are evident in the first few years of his journey by his unwanted shaved head, his curiosity of Western Culture, and even learning how to drive a car.
This movie speaks to the exclusivity of different religions and cultures, as you watch the heartbreaking story unravel and the Tibetan religion of Buddhism used against the people of Tibet, who fall as a result of their devotion to Buddha and the Dalai Lama. You also get to see parts of a Buddhist ""funeral"" service, during which Kundun's father is dismembered. The evidence of the true Buddhist way, including their devotion to non violence is everywhere, in almost every scene throughout the movie. I truly recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about religion, or has a wish to understand the ideology of Buddhist culture. The reservation these people practice is riveting and shows true dedication to their leaders. Martin Scorsese does an excellent job portraying the innocence and passion involved in Tibet during this time. Speaking later to a reporter, he says this: ""Non violence is the only revolutionary idea left to us.""",1267056000,,1932,4.857575757575757

They believed that this child was the Dali Lama, just based upon a few observations that they had.  They put a few items in front of him and some belonged to the Dali Lama's of the past and mixed in some items that were the same but had no meaning.  The child was able to identify all the items that had belonged to the pervious Dali Lama's and even responded that they belonged to him.  This movie explores the life of the child growing up being a very religious figure.  The 14th Dali Lame was eventually exiled out of Tibet, and taken to India for his safety and for his people.  He still resides there today.  This movie relates to my religions class because right now we are working on Buddhism.  This movie showed the life of the monks and there practices.  It showed there rituals and chanting that they did.  It really gave an inside look of the temple and how things work.  It also gave a sense of the middle way and how they truly believed that living a certain way would bring enlightenment.  There no violent methods of thing was also very important, they didn't fight back just transported the 14th Dali Lama to India.  For their thought was every action has a reaction. This movie kinda had the same non violent concept of the last movie that we watched which was Ghandi.  that movie was about Hinduism and this movie is about buddhism.

953923,4,6305006571,"Martin Scorsese does an outstanding job directing the artfully moving and emotionally charged motion picture, ""Kundun."" The film provides a poignant and staunch recount of the early life and times of the fourteenth Dalai Lama, born in 1935 to an independent Tibet.

Deeply rooted in the religious beliefs and customs of Buddhism, this movie provides a judicious glimpse into life as it occurs within a Tibetan Monastery.  Meditation and sacred ceremonies find center stage as the life and early development of the fourteenth Dalai Lama are shared. Chanting, drumming, worship scenes, and blowing of horns create a pious feel toward the divine and lend themselves most appropriately to the film.

Legend has it that signs lead holy men to the birth place of the reincarnated Buddha. A common sign are two crows that guard the infant at birth. Once found, the child must first undergo various tests to prove he is truly the reincarnated one before being recognized as their holy leader, the Dalai Lama.

Whether it was intended or not is unknown, but the film could almost serve as a documentary -- as it takes us from the time of birth of the fourteenth Lama, through young adulthood. It explores the exploits and cruelty that awaits the peaceful and independent land of Tibet, when communistic China decided the country should be under its control.  By the film's end, it successfully and skillfully captured the historic and tragic outcome that occurred when nonviolence and compassion met with greed, desire, and unthinkable violence; thus, eventually leading to the inauspicious fleeing of the Dalai Lama from his homeland to the safety of India for the sake of his people. He still resides there today.

Written by Melissa Mathison, this recipient of four Oscar nominations is a very good film and comes highly recommended. Receiving a rating of PG-13, it may not be suitable for younger viewers, but is a good choice for the mature audience.",1255824000,,1946,5.0092879256965945

A two year old child is located and believed to be the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha Compassion, Dali Lama. He is destined to become the spiritual and political leader of his people. A couple of years later, the child is brought to Lhasa and he was trained as a monk. At the age of fourteen, he uses news reels and magazine articles to study the war in the west, World War II. The film allows us to watch him grow up into his teenage years. At the age of 14, Tibet is invaded by the Chinese and he, the child, is forced into a coalition government dealing with Chinese Communism. In 1959, after he has met with Mao, he must then make the decision between staying in Tibet to fight for his people's freedom or fleeing the country to save his own life.
  The young Dalai Lama is raised to be the spiritual leader of a country that will, for all practical purposes, cease to be while he is still a young man, having been annexed by the Chinese government. The movie shows the torment the Dalai Lama feels being in the middle of political arguments he cares for so very little. Throughout the entire movie, the Dalai Lama struggles not with his faith, but simply with his destiny.
  This movie typifies religions of today. China is still a communist nation, predominately Buddhist, which deals heavily with the plot of this movie. Buddhism is a large religion and according to [...], there are is an estimated 300 million to 1 billion Buddhist. The central theme of this movie along with the Buddhist religion is non-violence.

From childhood until his exile as an adult, 14th Dalai Lama deals with upheavals and Chinese oppression. This crisis leads officials in the Tibetan government to vest the Dalai Lama with temporal power in order to quell the fears of the populace. In a brief encounter with Mao, the young Tibetan leader recognizes that his society of spirit and nonviolence clashes with China's culture of materialism and militarism. This presentation of the childhood and adolescence of the fourteenth Dalai Lama is memorable mainly for its moral message about the courage it takes to adhere to the Buddhist principle of nonviolence in the face of so much suffering and injustice.

This movie also shows the Dalai Lama to have been reincarnated of Buddha himself. In efforts to make certain that this Dalai Lama was the ""right one,"" the Buddhist monks took him through a series of test that allow him to identify items that had previously belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The test that they had set forth had proved to be true when began shouting, ""Mine, Mine, Mine!""  At that point they were certain that they this young boy was in fact the next Dalai Lama also known as Kundun. The film charts the extraordinary growth of Dalai Lama from a giggling child into a world leader who raised the global consciousness about the Buddhist society, and the plight of Tibet and its people. While growing up the Dalai Lama had been taught at all cost to avoid violence. His belief in non-violence never waivered, even while facing brutality. Even with his strong faith, there was never a compromise when it came to conflicts between faith and politics. The Dalai Lama had been born into a troubled 20th century. As he grew up, he often had to watch films of other atrocities around the world. This lead him to wonder how other cultures could not embrace peace as he thought others should. But then China, under Mao's chairmanship, decides to assert its power and take Tibet for itself, knowing full well that the peaceful Tibetans will not defend themselves with the use of violence. China initially appears to be a moderate conqueror, asking only for cooperation, but when the Dalai Lama meets with Mao, the truth of China's intentions becomes evident. And it's not a truth that's acceptable to Tibet. The occupation by China and its associated oppression and cultural destruction goes on to this day. The Dalai Lama depicted in Kundun still lives in exile in India, still hoping to be able to one day return to a free Tibet. This story is, after all, a familiar one, one nation imposing its will, by force, on another. But while the horrors and injustices of World War 2 have been at least partially rectified, Tibet still suffers under occupation when, to put it in simple terms, all they wanted was to be left alone.",1254614400,,2215,4.664961636828645

It beautifully depicts the culture of Tibet at that time - the devout people and their dress, the monasteries, the sand mandala, and the disturbing scenes with the Nechung Oracle spinning in his trance.

""I was trying to put together a story through images, music, colour and light; a movie that would ultimately reflect emotionally and psychologically, the philosophy of a people and Tibetan culture"" - Martin Scorsese.

The story is told through the eyes of the Dali Lama. So we only know as much as the boy knows. Although Tibet is shown as an idyllic land, the film shows that the Dalai Lama recognizes and wants to fix problems as well. He tells Mao, 'I see a lot of ways to change, especially industrialize Tibet'. After the Chinese invasion at the end of the film he says, 'we were just about to change, we were about to do it ourselves'.",1254268800,,976,4.508474576271187
953976,5,6305006571,"For anyone interested in Buddhism, Tibet, or simply how the world works in mysterious ways, I highly recommend watching Kundun. This factual tale traces the progress of the current Dalai Lama from his childhood - when he was an unknown farmboy in a remote farming village - through his discovery and eventual escape from Tibet as the Chinese came in with bombing runs.

The story is almost entirely told from the boy's point of view. This is very charming at times - but can also be confusing. The boy is baffled by many things which are going on around him - but that means we as viewers are also getting confused. Just why are some of the regent changes occuring? Just what exactly is going on in the political situation? You really need to research it all beforehand, so you understand the context the movie is set in.

With that all being said, it is a fantastically moving movie. You get a sense both of the real and the mythical here. Is the young boy really a reincarnation of a previous person? In some situations he seems to know something only the previous Dalai Lama would know. In other situations he is almost looking for visual cues to determine if he should choose item X or Y.

The landscapes are, of course, gorgeous. Between the clothing, the scenery, the movement of the people, the feel of the language, you can almost smell the spices and feel the breeze on your face.

Perhaps more than that, you really begin to appreciate just how special it is to be able to be who you are, to believe what you want to believe in, without being bombed or shot at for it.

I like that Kundun does not try to portray the Dalai Lama as a perfect being. He is stubborn at times, goes through normal growing pains. His family is a little uncertain at times, having him go from the precocious child to the ruler of their country.

In many ways this is a documentary. It captures the views, language, culture of Tibet in an era of transition. That alone is worth a watch or two.

953981,3,6305006571,"The movie Kundun, originally released in 1997, seeks to convey the life story of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and secular leader of Tibet.  Beginning with his selection to be the next Lama at the age of two, the movie follows his life as he embarks on the noble path that has been set before him.  Unfortunately, although the film is well made and visually stimulating, Kundun fails to be widely appealing due to its focus on Buddhist ritual, and its solemn, often somber, tone.
 Kundun, which means presence, is the name by which the fourteenth Dalai Lama is known.  In 1937, he was identified as being the reincarnation of the thirteenth Lama.  He was sent to a large monastery where he was raised and trained in Buddhist teaching and meditation techniques.  As he ages, he begins to follow and take interest in world events, specifically World War II and the impending threat the Chinese pose to his country and people.
 In 1950 China invaded Tibet, setting into motion a series of events that would dramatically influence the now fifteen year old Kundun's life.  Initially, he tried to peacefully co-exist with the occupiers, even agreeing to a Seventeen Point Agreement laid out by the Chinese.  This agreement would ultimately break down in 1959 however, due to the unwillingness of the Chinese to abide by the conditions.  A Tibetan uprising resulted but was defeated and the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India to escape, setting up a government in exile in Dharamsala, India.
 To its credit, Kundun is visually breathtaking.  The exotic scenery and colorful dressings provide multiple layers of sensory input.  Coupled with a chilling musical score from Philip Glass and remarkable cinematography, the result is epic.  The direction - contributed by legend Martin Scorsese - is skillful, providing the overall vision throughout the movie that holds everything together during the chronological advance.
 Regrettably however, Kundun spends too much of its time preoccupied with Buddhist rituals.  The pacing of the story is interrupted time and again with long scenes of intense ritualistic practices.  There is a ritual for Kundun's enthronement, one for his welcoming, assorted scenes of chanting and drumming, and on and on; too many for the average person. While this may add a certain level of realism to the story, it diminishes its appeal to a wider audience, aiming squarely at adherents only.  Additionally, the overall tone of the film seems needlessly gloomy and heavy.  Coupled with the protracted scenes of ritual, and the potential market for this movie has been seriously reduced; as evidenced by its poor showing at the box office.
 As with any historical piece, a balance must be struck between accuracy and entertainment.  While Kundun does an excellent job with the accuracy part, it stumbles slightly in providing entertainment for mass consumption.",1224374400,,2881,5.087234042553192

The Dahlia Lama was their ruler; his was the human manifestation of the Buddha of compassion.  In 1933 the thirteenth Dahlia Lama died.  Four years later a holy man, found himself in a far corner of Tibet, he was searching for the fourteenth Dahlia Lama.  A Buddha had been reborn.  The beginning of the story goes like this.... The mother was talking to her son saying, ""Your father had been sick and we thought he would die, some cows, horses, a yak, and chickens had died.""  She said that all the farmers had bad crops for four years.  She told her son, ""One night I knew you were coming and at dawn you were born and you did not cry.  Your father got better and named you Lhamo, the protector.""  Lhamo loved to hear the story of his birth.
Tibetan men came into the village and Lhamo seemed to had sensed something.  One of the Tibetan men bent down to talk to Lhamo and Lhamo saw that the man was wearing his necklace.  Lhamo then told the man that the necklace he was wearing was his.  The man said, ""If you can tell me my name, I will give you the necklace.""  Lhamo told the name man that his name was Lama and he was correct.  Lama did not stay long but when he left Lhamo started to cry.  The same man returned that night and the mother got Lhamo out of bed, took him into the room where Lama was.  There was man items lying on a table and Lama asked Lhamo, ""What else belongs to you?""  Lhamo picked up a drum, a bell, a stick, a bowl, a pair of glasses, and finally a cain.  He was able to pick out all of the items that belonged to the thirteenth Dahlia Lama.  Lama then called the little boy ""Kundun"".  Kundun was recognized from this point on to be the fourteenth Dahlia Lama.  He was taken to a monastery where he was given a regent which is a monk teacher.  The teacher told him that, ""To this life you will be born again and again as long as all life continues.  Love, care and have compassion for all living things.  The Buddha shall appear.""  Kundun was dressed in gold from head to toe.  All the Tibetan people were present; he was then introduced as the ""Buddha of compassion"", ""the wishful fulfilling jewel"", ""the fourteenth Dahlia Lama"".  Kundun was continually being taught about the three jewels and the importance of the Four Noble Truths but it seemed that he already had wisdom beyond his years.
By the time he became about seventeen or eighteen years old the Chinese were getting ready to invade Tibet.  As a leader he was uncertain about his ability to save the people.  Lord Chamberlain told Kundun that he needs the warning of predecessor or the war will end here.  Kundun was then given a letter and told that it was written when the thirteenth Dahlia Lama was eighteen years old.  The letter said that he had to lead spiritually and be the secular head of the country, and that the Chinese invaded.  He said, ""The power of truth was great, we prayed and the Karma is infallible, we routed the Chinese out.""  Then the monk that read Kundun the letter told him, ""You are the man that wrote this letter, you must lead us.""  Kundun had decided to write President Truman of the United States a letter, asking if they would come to the aid of Tibet.  He never received any true confirmation.  During all of this Kundun lost his friend and teacher, Regent Reting.  They held a ritual for Regent Reting and over his body they said, ""Do not be distracted as you enter into the coming of the awareness, go to your father, he is dead.""
China had three demands of Tibet which was Tibet must except that it is part of China, Tibet's defenses must be conducted by China, and that all political and trade matters concerning foreign countries must be conducted through China.  Kundun said, ""We accept no conditions from China.  I will consult our protective deities; Lord Buddha appears where he is needed.""  China invaded by crossing into six locations of Tibet.  Kundun heard on the radio that Tibet agreed to China's conditions. The Tibetan people found themselves living in a feudal kingdom under the tyranny of the Dahlia Lama.
Kundun became of age and celebrated the auspicious day for his enthronement.  At that time Kundun told the monks to free the prisoners.  He said, ""The gods will win.""  Kundun then left for the Indian border.  The monks pleaded for him not to go.  He went there first to gather with his people.  Here he heard over the Chinese radio that today the surrender of Tibet was complete.  The people Republic of Tibet signed a seventeen point agreement that returned Tibet to the motherland.  The Dahlia Lama Representative signed the agreement in his name.  Kundun went to China to talk with Chairman Mao.  Chairman Mao told Kundun that religion is poison and that it retards the minds of the people.  Kundun returned home because he knew there was nothing he could do.  China began bombing the monasteries and killing the monks.  Kundun had a dream of standing in the middle of thousands of dead monks and after that he said that wisdom and compassion will set us free.  He said, ""You cannot liberate us, you can only liberate one's self.""  ""Beings are released by the teachings of the truth.""  For Kundun's safety he was told to go to India.  He has not yet returned....
Relating this movie back to the practice of Buddhism, it is known that Buddhists are non-violent as it relates to any living creature.  One's life reflects back to your deeds that you do each and every day, known as karma.  The movie depicts what monks look like and the culture in which most of them live.  They also perform certain rituals in the movie that look somewhat like what is in the book.  It truly depicts one's desire to be of good nature, all of the ones in the movie where good to each other and extremely respectful.",1224374400,,5910,4.470533208606174

There was a test given toKundun to prove his purpose after he succeded they moved him and his family to Lhasa. After the boy was removed from his homeland the monks raised him as the re3incarnation of Budda, the most powerful leader in Tibet. It was interesting to see how a young Kundun, just fourteen was conventially appointed to the throne as the Chinese invasion began. The Chinese had wanted Tibet to become a part of them but the people refused.  The movie contiounes through his growth into adulthood and displays the trials he is faced with alomg the way. The whole story was revolved around Kundun's and the Tibet people before and during the invasion of their country. Eventually the Dalai Lama had to flee to India and live in exile for the rest of his life. I have never watched ""Seven Years in Tibet"" completely through however what I have seen is similar to ""Kundun"" . All in all the movie seem to be a good movie for the whole family. Although there may be some scenes that small children would have a problem with. The way the young child grew and took respondsiblity for his country which had suffering, showed the courage that different culture take.  The information I have obtained from the chapter on Buddism has opened my eyes to the different beliefs and their reactions to stressfull situations.

953984,4,6305006571,"Kundun is a extraordinary story filled with colorful details of the Dalai Lama's life that were not apparent to me before I watched this movie. The message is deep, powerful, but the direction is not; this movie could have been made so much better if it was directed well.
The story starts off with Lamo, a arrogant little boy, who goes on to become the humble Dalai Lama. He is said to have been born in sight of two crows, a sign which was apparent for all the incarnations of the Buddha, he himself is the 14th. His destiny takes him to the heart of Tibet, Lhasa, at a young age. His family follows, but their paths still separated from his. Lamo spends his time in the shadow of monks, learning vigorously the tasks, and teachings of Buddhism. As he grows older he becomes more and more involved with videos and documentaries that were gifted to Tibet by the United States, he begins to educated himself more and more about international relations. Meanwhile, the Chinese threaten to attack his country, in a desperate attempt he writes to the president of the United States, the United Nations, and etc for help. Bound by religion and strict ethics, he chooses not to fight back, instead watch the destruction of his land and people under the communist regime of Mao. He is haunted by images of blood and bodies of monks spread out on the street. He travels to China, hoping to settle things down, but is unable to. After his return, the Chinese threaten to kill him, knowing that his death would mean the death of hope in Tibet he chooses to flee to India.

This story has a lot of Buddhist ideologies. One which stood out strongly to me was the concept of reincarnation, as Lamo was the 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama, the compassionate Buddha. Another point which astounds me is that when attacked by the Chinese he chose not to fight back, even though he had an army, he followed the ideology of Buddhism which enforces peace and non-violence. He is also taught the concepts of Dharma by the monks, as well as taught how to meditate on a daily basis, the book of world religions teaches these basic fundamentals in the Buddhism chapter.",1223164800,,2149,4.567357512953368

The Dalai Lama, also known as Kundun, is born into an ordinary Tibetan family, and is soon discovered to be the reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama.  An interesting segment in the movie is a scene where Kundun is visited by a Buddhist Lama, or priest, and Kundun sees his necklace and proclaims, ""That is mine.""  This seems to clue the Lama in that this might be the actual Dalai Lama, and soon, Kundun is brought into a room with objects belonging to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, and he is asked to identify the objects which belong to him.  Kundun correctly identifies the objects, and is proclaimed as the Fourteenth Dalai Lama.  He then is instructed in the ways of Buddhism, and we learn the Four Noble Truths; suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering.  The Dalai Lama embraces these truths, and embarks on a path of nonviolence, pledging to protect his people.

There are great scenes with lush imagery and beautiful, colorful costuming that make this film very watchable.  Dialogue is rather sparse, which makes it a bit difficult for those of us who have not studied Buddhism to understand; I found that turning on the subtitles helped a great deal.  We then see the historical events of the Chinese takeover of Tibet unfold; what seems at first to be a helpful Chinese government soon turns into an oppressive one, and the Dalai Lama is urged to flee the country, which he eventually does, reluctantly.  He knows that he is abandoning the country that he loves, and the people he has pledged to serve.  One especially moving scene is a dream sequence where Kundun is standing, and as the camera pans out, you see that he is standing among thousands of deceased Tibetan monks dressed in their red robes.  The Dalai Lama takes refuge in India, and as he turns back to see his entourage, he again has a vision of them dead and bleeding on their horses.  He settles in India close to the Tibetan border and watches over Tibet with a coveted telescope that he was given earlier in the film.

The film ends telling us that the Dalai Lama has never returned to Tibet, but hopes to one day.  There is much imagery of world religions in the film including costuming, Buddhist rituals, sacred objects, a fascinating oracle who appears twice in the film and helps the Dalai Lama plan his escape from Tibet, and beautiful sand mandalas at the beginning and end of the film.  The act of creating the mandalas is a form of Buddhist meditation; contemplation of the mandalas is another form of meditation, and in the end, the sand which forms the mandalas is swept away to reinforce the idea that all action is impermanent.  Beautifully filmed, great cinematography, and a surprising offering from Scorsese.",1222905600,,2903,4.716831683168317
954037,5,6305006571,"""Kundun"" is an enlightening, affecting experience giving viewers insights into the early life of the Dalai Lama. He was chosen from an ordinary family and was given a few simple tests to see whether there was a spiritual connection between him and the thirteenth Dalai Lama who had passed. (From assorted objects did he gravitate toward those belonging to the late Dalai Lama?) He became the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lamas, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet and for the Tibetan people, a living god in the Tibetan Buddhist creed.
 Martin Scorcese, filming in Morocco, has made a devotional work, an authentic-looking piece with a brilliant depiction of the colorful vestments and garments worn by the monks, a sense of place in Lhasa, the capital, and the recreation of the pageantry, the rituals and rites practiced in Lamaism. One scene shows the funeral ceremony of a dead body left outside to be picked over by vultures as in the Parsi religion.
 The film shows the boy struggling to learn his duties and later coming to grips with the toughest decisions he has to make when Tibet is brutally taken over by China. Forced to flee to India in 1959 at age twenty-four, we leave him wistfully looking over the mountains to his lost country.
 He is presented as a quiet, humble, meditative pacifist. He knows in his meeting with Mao that China, which has forsaken religion, will never let Tibet be free. The Dalai Lama represents unconditional love. He is the compassionate Buddha, a monk and a head of state who has to be Kundun, the Presence.
 The movie is inspiring, a learning experience done with all the wizardry a gifted director can muster.

A very sad and yet hopeful telling of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama's life from 1937-1959 when he fled Tibet for his saftey and to safe his country from communisum and Chairman Mao.  It is one of the most memorable films that I have ever seen.  I have watched it countless times and have shown it to many friends and family members.

954041,5,6305006571,"Martin Scorsese has created a visually stunning, mostly-accurate but otherwise extremely hagiographical view of the life of the Dalai Lama when he was discovered to be the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama to his flight from Tibet in 1959. Only one scene takes place in India and a few take place in China, though I am to understand that it was shot almost entirely in Morocco. Of course no movie can be filmed about the Dalai Lama in Chinese-controlled Tibet, but Scorsese manages to recreate the rich mountain landscape through brilliant splicing with the Moroccan sets. Philip Glass's score, which mixes orchestra music with Tibetan chants, creates a passionate effect. I confess I always get a little choked up at the end, when the young Dalai Lama approaches the Tibetan-Indian border and takes his final steps out of his homeland, then looks back on the mountain range he is forbidden to return to.

The movie's main weakness is pacing. The early scenes of the Dalai Lama's childhood are touching, the views of rural Amdo (now a Chinese province and not part of the autonomous region of Tibet) and feudal Lhasa area a portrait of a life that is gone, and very reminiscent of the movie ""The Last Emperor."" After age 12, the movie jumps ahead to age 16 and the invasion of the Chinese, and becomes a complex political story of mediation, disappointment, and disaster. It runs about half an hour too long, though the last 10 minutes will stay with you for a long time.

Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong plays the adult Dalai Lama (age 16 and on), and has been criticized for his acting, as he is often passive and lifeless and not resembling the real Dalai Lama we know from speeches and public appearances, who is charismatic and smiling. Of course some of this is based on fact; the Dalai Lama is more serious when dealing with Tibetan politics than when addressing a University crowd, and he was going through a difficult time and faced with impossible political choices. Still, he doesn't liven up the screen, and the actors playing his real-life advisers (who match photographs of them very well) are still serious but more fascinating to watch as actors. The Dalai Lama at this age is overwhelmed by his political position, and the actor is overwhelmed by the role.

There are some historical inaccuracies, though to be fair, not many. The opening line on the screen about how Tibetan lamas had practiced non-violence for centuries isn't true; the movie contradicts it by showing the Regent's uprising when the Dalai Lama is 12, when Reting tried to unseat the current Regent with his army of monks. The lamaist state had an army, and used violence to protect the country and occasionally to suppress other strains of Buddhism. It's hard to open a film with a lie; I don't understand Scorsese's decision there.

The movie is accused of being a hagiography, but almost all of the significant events have been confirmed by several sources, from the Dalai Lama himself in his autobiography, to his mother's autobiography, to the official Tibetan state records, to photographic records, to his brother's autobiography. Several minor facts were changed for dramatic purpose: the 2-year-old Dalai Lama ran out to greet the disguised monk looking for him in real life, while in the movie it occurs later, in the house. The scene where the 4-year-old Dalai Lama finds and identifies his ""old teeth"" (dentures belonging to the 13th Dalai Lama) is confirmed in his mother's autobiography, though HH says on his website that he has no memory of it, but does not doubt that it happened.

Several key issues are not addressed. Heinrich Harrer, the Dalai Lama's childhood friend until he was 9, is absent from the film, either because of timing reasons or because Harrer was a Nazi in hiding. There is one image of a Tibetan slave in the film, who bows to the Dalai Lama, who prays for him. The man is not identified as a slave by the film; a viewer could assume he is a convict by his shackles. Scorsese does not shy away from portraying Tibet as a corrupt, backwards state that even the Dalai Lama admits to several times in the film and has admitted to in real life (he was very impressed with Mao Zedong until Mao said all religion was a poison, at which point the man regarded as a living Buddha probably thought they weren't seeing eye-to-eye). The Panchen Lama, who was very active in Tibetan politics at the time of the Chinese invasion, is completely absent from the film. (The current Panchen Lama is a political prisoner in China, so he couldn't be consulted) In the scene with Mao, only the Dalai Lama is present, but in historical photographs of the meeting, the Panchen Lama is there with him.

These quibbles are actually quite minor; the vast majority of the film is drawn from historical sources and stands up to the account of everyone who was there and lived to tell about it (except the Chinese gov't, which has banned the film). Much like ""The Last Emperor,"" it captures a world that was lost to time and political change, and can never be seen again, except in this re-creation.

As the Dalai Lama says himself as he passes over the mountains that lead to India and his future exile, ""All will become nothing. Just like a dream, whatever things I enjoy will become a memory. Whatever is past will not be seen again."" Except, of course, on DVD.",1209427200,2,5353,4.718716577540107

This, as China prepares to host this summer's Olympic Games. I, personally, am hopeful that many athletes, as well as others, throughout the world, will watch  a version of this excellent motion picture and understand from it the very important part that China has played in depriving the people of Tibet of their spiritual and established governmental leadership throughout the last half century. I think it is important to understand that this deprivation is not limited strictly to the Dalai Lama being forced into exile, but includes others; who, as Mr. Scorcese's film points out, might find themselves moved, even as young children, to attempt to separate large genetically predisposed insects from attempting to destroy one another and ultimately destroying themselves. I think we might all ask ourselves if there exist ways to protest the flagrant disposition of such behavior by our governments.",1205625600,2,1155,5.243243243243243
954044,5,6305006571,"This is a movie centered around the life of the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama through to his exile to India.  Before he was discovered, he was already a special little boy.  Traveling monks discovered him at about two years old by offering a sampling of the 13th Dalai Lama's possessions.  Amazingly, Kundun recognized correctly which items were his own and even remembered where his false teeth were kept.  The monks returned to retrieve Kundun about three years later to whisk him away.  He was taught extensively to prepare him for political and spiritual leadership and addressed as ""Holiness"".  He maintained his childish behaviors such as watching this little mouse with curiosity as well as eating pork and eggs when he shouldn't and even wrecking a car.  He continued to mature and learn more about life around him.  In the meantime, he noticed the Chinese political issues involving Tibet and other minor issues are kept in secrecy from him.  He then instructed the others that he isn't a child anymore and he needs to know what they know so he can lead his people.  Eventually the Chinese insisted on reforming Tibet since the Dalai Lama's legend is poisoned.  Kundun pleaded with neighboring countries for help to no avail.  The Chinese continued to invade further.  Ultimately, he is torn between his beliefs and protecting his people and hesitantly exiled to India.

This movie shows many references to Buddhism and beliefs through the Dalai Lama.  One basic belief is the Dalai Lama's non-violent lifestyle.  Throughout his life, he emphasizes his belief, even as a young child, he would separate fighting bugs so they wouldn't hurt each other.  He recognized one of the lamas and the lama's beads as his own, which prompted them to realize that he is probably the 14th reincarnation.  Later as an adult, he refused to fight against China's persistent invasion.  The elaborate ceremonies with the singing/chanting, horns, drums, and beautiful robes were very realistic.  The monastic existence Buddhists practice is very obvious.  Kundun is taught many aspects of Buddhism including the Four Noble Truths of Buddha from his first sermon and the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha).  He is also taught to love all living things and refrain from any violence or killing as a part of Buddhism practices.",1203724800,2,2325,5.015665796344647

954107,4,6305006571,"Martin Scorsese's film Kundun, about the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, is beautiful but hidden within the film is a subtle debate on political timing, defining defeat, and defining victory.

My eyes were entranced by the beauty of the film, its wonderful cinematography, costumes, rituals and pageants. The uniqueness of the Tibetan Buddhist culture and the impact on architecture, furniture, costume, and social hierarchy was highly entertaining and interesting. The music of Phillip Glass was a wonderful compliment to the cinematography.

However the film was more than a sequential story of the period in the life of the 14th Dalai Lama between the times he was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937 to the time he crosses the mountains into India seeking political asylum. The film is about the careful cat and mouse game between the Communist Chinese invaders into Tibet and the range of options left to the Dalai Lama. If he remains in Tibet under communist rule, he could become the puppet of the communists, even if he selects to isolate and circumscribe his domain as purely spiritual. If he remains in Tibet he would be the focus of insurgency by faithful Tibetans, particularly the Buddhist monks, which would set the stage for complete annihilation of the priesthood of the Tibetan Buddhist. The longer he stays in Tibet, the more endorsement it appears he lends to the Communist invasion. Yet, his ties to the people is of such great strength, that to leave Tibet would signal a major victory for the communist Chinese. However, to leave Tibet also has its consequences, some of which are mentioned above. Eventually the Dalai Lama does leave Tibet, a very sad but necessary move to retain the integrity of Tibetan Buddhism in the face of overwhelming forces. Why was this sad decision the right decision? Because a non-violent philosophy would indicate that in the face of great evil, one must run away until the great evil passes by. Scorsese recognizes that the timing and decision to leave Tibet is the crux of the film and he builds the tension and action of the film around this. If you are the reincarnation of Buddha, Kundun, then communism is a passing season, a winter storm from which you must seek shelter. If you are the Buddha, then one day Spring will come and you will return.",1201219200,2,2330,4.851758793969849

According to him most of the events (most significantly the episode with the false teeth of His Holiness the 13th Dalai Lama) actually happened while a lot of the ""details"" were sometimes fluff.  From what I could find out and depending on your own interpretation of reincarnation, his holiness the 14th Dalai Lama is INDEED the reincarnation of the 13th.  Viewed from this position, the film takes on another light.  If I can believe the King James version of the bible, I can sure lend a little credence to the events depicted in the film.

Otherwise this is a very unusual film, worth your time and popcorn.  With the possible exception of the first 12 minutes that take about two hours to pass and still leave me confused as to just what had happened.  ENJOY!!

As a toddler, he identified possessions of the late 13th Dalai Lama. He was thus declared the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet - the reincarnation of his predecessor.

Mystical as it sounds, the movie does not fail to present the human side of the Dalai Lama. As a boy, he was disobedient and insisted on eating eggs. As a teenager, he was arrogant towards his teachers. He even drove a car and crashed it.

As someone who is in touch with the realities in Tibet and all too familiar with the infatuation of many Western fans, I was pleasantly surprised when the young Dalai Lama asked his new regent: ""monks have guns?"". Greed, corruption, power struggle, backstabbing politics. This unpretentious film distingusihes itself from a lot of others in the same genre by making no apologies for the fact that Tibet was no Shangrila before or after the Chinese invasion.

The 14th Dalai Lama had recognised that his country needed reform and modernisation. Alas, it was all too late. The Chinese had invaded. The aggressors tried the soft approach first, making the Tibetans agree to their terms. The Dalai Lama was even quoted as saying that perhaps Buddhism can coexist with communism. How did Chairman Mao come to say that religion is poison and how did things in Tibet get really violent? Did the Tibetans kill the Chinese migrants like they did the Christian missionaries who came a century earlier? There seems to be no coherent explanation for the escalation in violence. Perhaps even the historians on the Tibetan side can't explain.

The movie takes us all the way to the Dalai Lama's escape from Chinese-controlled Tibet, going into exile in India. Not all the scenery is authentically Tibetan, but the cinematography is exellent. Disappointingly, however, are the dull scripting and the rather amateurish acting. Still, I think it's a very touching and important movie that everyone should watch. Amidst all the Chinese propaganda and anti-Chinese ""documentaries"" like ""Cry of the Snow Lion"", this movie adds a touch of balance to an often emotive issue.

Kundun is an often neglected masterpiece by Martin Scorsese.  It recounts the story of the Dali Lama from his birth and coronation to his escape to India.  Martin Scorsese explores many themes including the tragic rape of Tibet by the Red Chinese, fundamental principles of Tibetan Budhism, the culture of a dying nation and the psychological journey of the Dali Lama from a magical childhood to, in many ways, an unbearably tragic adulthood.  The photography, cinematography, editing and musical score by Philp Glass are mesmerizing.  This is an incredible movie and, in my opinion, one of the director's best.  I saw it 3 times in a theatre and a few on DVD.  It is one I never tire of or fail to notice something new upon subsequent viewings.",1183334400,2,874,5.583333333333333

954196,3,6305006571,"The ability of human faith to stay alive across generations when such a faith is denied a chance to exist is amazing! Someone somewhere always keeps tiny little sparks alive for causes forced to be forgotten.

Therefore, Tibet has hope.

No matter how many years China rules Tibet; no matter how many Chinese settle down in Tibet and convert Tibet into a Chinese territory, someone somewhere would keep tiny little sparks alive to keep Tibet's identity as a peaceful serene temporal/religious system.

Kundun is the story of Dalai Lama.

The young boy is discovered to be the reincarnation of the earlier deceased Dalai Lama; is taken to Lhasa and coached in the ways of Buddhism. How does the peaceful wise leader of a non violent nation fight the aggressive plans of an ambitious, efficient and modernized army of Red China? Is the nation important? Or is ""ahimsa"" important? It is exceptionally difficult for a young Dalai Lama to decide.

In the end, Red China occupies Tibet and Dalai Lama is forced to move to friendly India and form a government in exile. He is yet to return to Tibet.

Tibet is forgotten by World because the aggressor does not play by its rules and the offended would not resort to terrorism.

However, nations never cease to exist. Someone somewhere keeps a tiny spark alive. Martin Scorsese's 1997 movie: Kundun is one more spark for Tibet's continued existence.

The movie stays away from melodrama. China is not portrayed as a villain. The way some Chinese narrate how Chairman Mao brought justice to their life is likely to win respect for communism. The young Lama is portrayed in life like terms: a vivid mixture of curiosity, anxiety and mischief. The maturity of the young adult Dalai Lama is nicely portrayed when he tells his mother that women cannot stay in the monastery after dark in a stern affectionate tone.

Lovely movie.",1175731200,4,1865,4.821316614420063
954197,5,6305006571,"The story begins with the search for the 14th Dalai Lama.  When the 13th Dalai Lama passed away in 1933, the task of finding the new successor by the Tibetan Government was not as simple as one might think.  The Government does not just pick a successor but they actually seek out to discover a child in whom the Buddha of compassion would incarnate.  It was not necessary that the child should have been born just at the time of the death of his predecessor, or even soon after, they would be indications of the direction in which the search should be made.  The child would be found to possess physical and mental attributes similar to those of the previous Dalai Lama.

When the regent of Tibet arrived at the predetermined destination, that is thought, might lead them to the 14th Dalai Lama they encounter a family that possessed a small child that fit the profile.  The Party of Tibetan dignitaries went into the house with Kewtsang Rinpoche (High Lama of Tibet) disguised as a servant and a junior official disguised as the leader.  Rinpoche was wearing a rosary which belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the little boy recognized it, and demanded that it should be given to him. The rosary was even hidden to the child under numerous garments but somehow he still knew it was there.  The boy also picked out the disguised leader by name as if he knew him and also knew he was the true leader..  This was followed by a series of tests which included choosing of correct articles which belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama. By these tests, they were further convinced that the reincarnation had been found.

The movie takes us through the young years of the Dalai Lama (which happens to mean ocean's of wisdom) and is to be some of the most trying times in Tibetan history.  In 1950, when he was only 16, the Dalai Lama was called upon to assume full political power when Tibet was threatened by the might of China.  Invasion of the Chinese to, ""liberate Tibet from the plague that is Buddhism,"" and try to convince that the people of Tibet that they need reform.  The Chinese kill monks, slaughter women force the children to kill their parents and force nuns and monks to fornicate in the streets.

The Young Dalai Lama is forced to either succumb to the rein of the Chinese and denounce their religion and culture or stand and fight which is a contradiction of the teachings and beliefs of the Buddha. Even if they fight, Tibet only had 5000 solders with primitive weapons, no match for the military power of China.

Kundun (literally meaning ""presence"".) is the most underrated movie ever directed by Martin Scorsese. Such a powerful film that the Chinese government has since banned Scorsese and crew from ever entering Tibet again.  If you watch this movie the first thing you notice is how the cinematography and the images really make the movie. The second thing you will notice is the haunting score.  Many scenes have sparse dialog and are really told by the sequence of shots. Scorsese directs shot after shot in a melodic pattern to guide the viewer though the story.  You know what's going on even with little or no dialog.  Every shot in the movie has a purpose and is executed artistic and masterfully.

An excellent account of the true story of the fourteenth Dalai Lama and the plight of Tibet to remain a free country ( and hopefully again) This was a time after WW2 where no one wanted to get involved and no other country or government came to the aid of Tibet even after countless pleas by the Dalai Lama himself.

 No big name movie stars but powerful acting.  The movie is a well woven story that really opens one's eyes to the plight of a different culture. At times it might be misunderstood and look to be ""dated"" but at further study you see that the way of the Tibetan people was one of true honor, complete dedication to ones beliefs and sacrifice of greed and personal successes in search of enlightenment for the betterment of an entire culture, not just person gain...  Living each day practicing the belief that all life is important. It's a shame that this way of life might be one that is lost to us forever and vary rarely is taken seriously by most 21st century idealist..  It's also a breath of fresh air to witness a positive religious expericance compared to today's world of so many fanatical type religious factions that have undermined laws and peoples personal freedoms.  Most people today witness countless ""god fearing people"" contradicting their own teachings with every breath they muster.",1173744000,7,4539,4.628428927680798

The story of the Dalai Lama is recreated yet again.  He is depicted at 2 years old, 5 years old, 12 years old and then at 15.  I  wish the casting was better.  The children looked very different from each other and had different personalities.  The little boy is mischievous and high spirited. The 15 year old is quiet and wise without a sparkle in his eye.  I miss that sparkle and wish that the 15 year old showed some of the energy of his younger selves.

This film got rave reviews.  It was even mentioned as a potential candidate for an academy award for Scorsese when it was released.  I don't get it.  To me, the 135 minutes was much too long.  I was bored most of the time.  No story can be this simple.  The Dalai Lama is discovered, he grows up, he goes into exile to save his life.  It could have been a documentary, but even a documentary is more interesting and I kept thinking that the History Channel could have done this story better.  I yearned to see some conflict other than the inevitable Chinese takeover.  I wanted to see some real characterization of the Dalai Lama.  And even though the cinematography was good, this script didn't do it. Too bad.  It was a good try.",1172966400,2,1439,4.334586466165414

954200,3,6305006571,"Make no mistake, I enjoyed this movie. My husband and I stayed for two months in Tibet last year. We watched Seven Years in Tibet before we went and watched Kundun after we came back. I think it's a beautiful movie in that the creators of the film obviously did a lot of homework on the exotic and unique aspects of Tibetan culture, which they incorporated successfully into the movie: the monasteries, the prostration praying, the mandala, the sky burial, the oracle, the Tibetan operas, the women singing while working, etc.

However, the flaws of this movie are a bit too obvious too. It's like the filmmakers put no effort into creating at least a Chinese 'Chinese army' - the soldiers, masked by goggles, are clearly not Chinese! Not even Asians. The views towards the Chinese invasion and the portrayal of Chairman Mao Zedong were simplistic and stereotypical. It seems to me the scriptwriters put unnatural words in their mouths, lines more likely to come from a history textbook. I have always been fascinated by Tibet, and I took my jounrney in Tibet into a search for the truth, the truth of what had happened.  I've talked with many Tibetans and my conclusion is that it's not a simple matter. It's true that the Tibetans still worship Dalai Lama, still devote themselves to Buddhism and that China indeed did terrible things there. But what many people fail to see is that China has also done constructive things there - building bridges and paved roads, providing electricity, and supporting communities to grow by sending doctors, engineers and business trainers. Tibetans have gotten on with their life! My Tibetan friends also told me that during the riots, Tibetan policemen tortured the prisoners much more brutally than the Chinese police. Only once in the movie did they elude to the poverty and sadness of the lives of people besides the religious leaders and landowners. The Dalai Lama mentioned in the movie: 'The sad thing is, we were just about to change.' Change from what? A deeper analysis by Scorsese would have answered this question.

I'm not trying to defend China for what they did. I'm just trying to prove here that it's not a simple, black and white, matter. It's scary when movies like this are taken as documentaries, when all the scenes are considered reality, and audience are, in a way, brainwashed into believing everything they saw in the movie was true. Especially people who have rarely traveled to other countries, who have a confined view of the world.",1168560000,8,2499,4.847775175644028

This movie was sort of a biography of the 14th Dalai Lama and his dealings with the Chinese oppression of Tibet. At about 1h 40min this film begins to get marginally interesting, but by then it is just too late. If you can't interest your audience in the first hour and a half then your film has problems.

One of the problems with this film is that it showed a lot of traditions, ceremonies, rituals etc. In the beginning I thought, well this is fine they will explain it all later. They did not. Any time you are seeing something on screen that is confusing but will never be explained...skip it. Just don't bother. One of Scorsese strengths is that he focuses on detail. In this case though it turned against him. Sure, these are the ceremonies they perform in Tibet but you have to know when more detail is important and when it is just boring and superfluous.

There were some amazing shots in the film. I always liked Roger Deakins cinematography and he is one of the few things that make this film even tolerable. There is an absolutely brilliant shot revealing the Dalai Lama standing in the middle of a mass of dead bodies.

I did learn a little history. Before this movie I knew nothing about the Dalai Lama, Tibet, the Chinese oppression, etc. I know a little now, but not enough to make the movie worth watching. It is interesting to note that after this film was released Scorsese was banned from ever entering Tibet.

I really wish I hadn't watched this movie. I lost 2 hours of my life to boredom and I'll never get that back.

954205,4,6305006571,"I went looking for this movie after having read a few books on Tibet, since I had missed it when it came out. I successively read all the reviews and I found out the discrepancy of opinions that have accompanied the movie from 1997 on. Scorsese fans either love it or hate it, considering it a bypass from his usual violence based poetics, Buddhists appreciate its theme and realization, people interested in Tibetan history find it not precisely attinent to reality. Epicurean aesthetics and Philp Glass accolytes magnificate the scenes and the music.

I believe that a classic is a work of art that endures through the years and awakens us each time we see it to the atmosphere and the feeling of the Author. I think this movie may be defined a classic.

Obviously the research on which it is based is meticulous. The Dalai Lama has been personally questioned and has contributed with his memories to the story. The costumes and settings are perfectly reconstructed and anyone interested in Tibetan civilization can see that all the elements religious and non are all there (the sand mandalas, the butter lamps, the one sided earrings, etc). The historical evolution of the situation of those difficult years is depicted from a subjective (the Dalai Lama's) point of view and the mesmerized character of the young monk can be felt throughout the film.

If in a movie we look for emotion, in this work of Scorsese I couldn't find it in the story, but if we judge a work of art by the techniques that are utilized, visual emotion arosen by the marvelous scenography is practically always present. The only scene that really touched me emotionally was the one of the D.L. dream, with him standing in the middle of dead monks, but if I remember the movie I can see all the embroidery and gold of the robes, the lights in the dark, the little mouse that eats out of the lamps, the beautiful mountains and the forlorn nature of the lake where the State affairs are decided. The trip to China is exactly as described by many other Tibetans interviewed in the following years (read Sandy Johnson's The Book of Tibetan Elders) and Mao is extremely attinent to his public image.

As a documentary the movie is perfect. I think it should be shown in schools (actually it was in one of my daughters schools) when talking about modern history in Asia.

Why did Scorsese make this movie? Probably he was fascinated by the subject as a great part of Americans in the late '90's. Many books were written on Tibet and the Dalai Lama was all over the place at that time, so Tibet was fashionable and the expected audience was present. But Scorsese also saw something else in the D.L., the confusion when faced with violence and the inability to act in response. This attitude is typical of Buddism, since in this system of thought the world is not really but a reflex and the sense given to human actions is not orientated to a material purpose. Non-violence had been actively used also in India by Gandhi with much greater success, so the D.L.'s same existence and his failure toward his country have been a topic of reflection for many people.

The immobilism of this young leader is portrayed magnificently and it is justified on the basis of the permanece of his civilization. Religion is everything in his life and a world that is not based on it is unconcievable for him. He ignores what is going on around him, the poverty of his people, the social revolution happening in China. Only at one point there is a word of regret when he says: what a pity, we were about to change by ourselves.

Tibetan history is still evolving, the crimes against humanity are still present, the world's attention is catalyzed towards this magnificent and fascinating country and I believe this movie strongly contributes to the knowledge of history and social customs of a disappearing society.",1150243200,8,3866,4.6932153392330385

In some senses it is quite unique in that there is little in the sense of on screen action. However in its simplicity lies its power. You really feel you are watching a real life event as it really happened, quite rare for a film.

Despite its theme it avoids any unnatural sentimentality or proselytising of the Tibetan cause. It merely tells the absorbing story; you become drawn in to the unfolding history and can only feel great sympathy with the Tibetan people.

There is a great scene when the Dalai Lama goes to visit Chairmen Mao. Initially Mao is very charming talking about the common goals of socialism and Buddhism. But at the end his tone changes, slipping in his wholly negative view of religion - using Marx's quote ""religion is the opiate of the people"" the Dalai Lama is then aware of what he is up against but like in many instances, merely maintains a dignified silence. This prayerful silence is invoked many times and leaves a very powerful impression. More powerful than the most dazzling speech could have been. The director Martin Scorsese said making the film was almost like a prayer. Watching the film was in many respects, quite meditative, enhanced by the beautiful soundtrack. However it also offers a unique insight into Tibetan culture and the Buddhist religion, and is a powerful condemnation of the political system that allowed the events to occur",1143763200,8,1492,4.756756756756757

Some parts are not suitable for children.  There are a few bloody scenes (visions of His Holiness) that depict what the Chinese had done to Tibetans.

It's an overwhelming story that tugs at the heart strings.  As a Buddhist myself (although of the Zen tradition) I have always admired His Holiness and found this true to his spirit of peace.  I don't believe it showed his witty and intelligent side though.  He is a real character with a hearty smile and great boyish demeanor.

With an entirely Tibetan cast, he works the magic of film, accompanied by beautiful, stunning photography.

At a bare minimum, one must understand what His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has done for his country in exile, or else, one will miss much of the importance of the film.

I remember watching this the first time and liking it, but feeling that it lacked cohesion. It does take awhile for the Kundun to mature to an adult so we can identify with him and care about him.

But now I look at the film as being almost two separate parts. The first half shows us the Dali Lama as a child who must take on the role of Kundun and gives us a very slow (and beautiful) sense of environment and atmosphere. It also quietly sets up characters that will grow in importance as the film continues. The second ""adult half"" of the movie focuses on the Kundun having to deal with an aggressive communist China closing in on him and his people.

I feel like many people (including Ebert who said this is the only Scorsese movie he would not want to see again...) watch it once and say it was slow and they didn't care about the Dali Lama character enough. Well if you only watch it once you won't be able to see the detail (like the shot of the Kundun looking at Mao's shoes, or the baby Kundun separating the fighting beetles) , and depth that make up the fabric of this movie. There are all kinds of great shots and quick edits (the 3 seconds of violence in this film are more powerful then the lengthened violence in other films), and symbolism that you simply can't get your mind around the first time you watch this movie.

First, let me explain that I absolutely love the film Kundun.

I beleive it is a true work of art/ labor of love that didn't receive the recognition it so much deserves.

Let me skip to the big point-- the last 10 minutes of this film is a near perfect blend of music, film and editing that is spot- on for the subject matter, which is enlightenment.

My guess is that a *very conscious* person had a lot to do with the creation, blending & timing of the music, script and film, especially for the last ten minutes-- OR that it was a total coincidence that it came out to be so near perfect. (either is very much in keeping with the movie's theme, which IMHO is NOT the Dalai Lama at all, but enlightenment)

Not for everyone, and I'm afraid I may have built it up in your mind too highly, so that you'll feel let down by the actual experience of the film & music itself, I can say that *everytime* I watch or listen to the last ten minutes (titled Escape to India), I cry for joy at *experiencing* a few minutes of the most sublime enlightenment, insight, sorrow & simple wonder at being alive in this dance of life myself, with you.

... and I'm not even Budhist.

Thank you, Martin Scorcese, Phillip Glass and all involved in this brilliant study of how a culture's focus on a single individual being assumed to be & treated as enlightened-- and his training to actually act the part, resulted in a person of great compassion, richness and insight.

In other words, their culture made him enlightened by treating him as enlightened.

What if we were all assumed to be enlightened and treated as such-- what difference would that make to you, at this very moment, dear reader, to live in such a world, as you absorb these words, now?

If that sentence has any impact on you at all, then you'll likely be *deeply moved* by both the movie and soundtrack.",1109376000,6,1874,4.3746397694524495

954354,4,6305006571,"As a previous reviewer has stated, the first few minutes of this movie are agonizingly slow. Thankfully the pace picks up later on, but only slightly. I found myself wondering if Scorsese had really directed this movie, since it seemed very different from his other projects.

The best part of Kundun was that it made me aware of the plight of the Tibetan people. But as with any one sided view of the events, especially on film, I was not quick to label the Chinese the bad-guys. The movie's focus is on the life of the Dalai Lama, and how he was raised up to rule his people. I have to admit that at times I found myself questioning the wisdom of trusting the destiny of a whole people to a little boy; it seemed like the stuff legends were made of, not how countries in the 21st century should be run.

The boy did grow into a man however, and he matured fairly quickly. Much credit must be given to the system that transformed him. Although this is a very Buddhist film, I concentrated on the political struggle between this midget; Tibet and its giant neighbor, China. If there is any value in Kundun, it is that it made me want to know more about the history of Tibet and its relationship with the Chinese. There are, to its credit, little snippets of information in the movie itself, especially the meeting between Chairman Mao and the young Dalai Lama.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars, because I thought Scorsese could have made this a better movie had he not relied so much on cinematography and concentrated more on the drama, that's just my opinion though. I would recommend this movie to you if you are interested in a brief, if one sided, overview of the situation between Tibet and China.",1094947200,7,1701,4.44551282051282

One of these was Kudun. It's very slow paced and if you are one of those people who needs to figure out a movie in the first ten minutes or you become cranky this isn't the film for you. To be honest, it's more like a historical paegent than a movie. It's beautiful to look at but it's so stiff and artificial that I think Martin Scorsese could've used puppets and gotten the same effect.

If you want to watch pretty scenary and costumes Kundun will be enough. If you want the true history of Tibet you'll have to go much further than this.",1094256000,4,709,4.412213740458015

It's very commendable of Scorcese.  No wonder Hollywood spurned it at the Oscars. At the very least there is a lot of unique, stunning, and ground breaking style and imagery in the movie that the subject brought out. But then this movie isn't for everyone. I've been in interested in Tibet since I was very young and I don't think this movie was intended to be a history lesson, but rather a tribute and representation of a unique spiritual life. The Dalai Lama is an inspirational human being and leader and it's great to see a movie on it that just has tibetan actors.  It is hard to compare the real Dalai Lama with the young character in the movie, but one has to realize the burden on young shoulders of having to choose the method of saving his country and people.",1091836800,8,960,4.448863636363637
954357,4,6305006571,"Some novels, films, plays, poems, sculptures, music, dances, and paintings are meant to entertain us in various ways, and some are meant to alter our outlooks on the world we live in. This film belongs to the latter category. Specifically, it's an instance of what Aristotle called ""epideictic rhetoric""--a work constructed to make us respect and admire (or disrespect and look down on) some person(s) or thing(s). In this case, as most reviewers notice, most of us come away feeling that we greatly respect and admire the Dalai Lama, who has developed into a highly enlightened and compassionate person DESPITE (or because of) great adversity. While our govt. has eagerly sucked up to Red China (which is guilty of ""human rights abuses"" against its own citizens as well as Tibetans), Martin Scorsese courageously unmasks the villains--none of that ""most favored nation"" stuff for him (which is why Red China has singled him out and forbidden him to go to Tibet). The film is genuinely touching and beautifully filmed. My only fault-finding with it is that the current Dalai Lama is presented as being IN FACT a reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lamas. Although I've been a Buddhist for over 40 years, I don't believe in reincarnation and doubt that many other viewers of this film--Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, atheist, etc.--do either; this COULD have been presented as part of a ""belief system"" and not as a ""factual"" condition. (Next time you watch one of the 57 different film versions of the crucifying of Jesus, look to see whether the director's approach is naturalistic or supernaturalistic and how that makes a difference on the impact. And look for the same factor next time you watch the Indiana Jones films, which are meant to entertain us. That may partly explain why the second of these films, which uses a non-Judeo-Christian array of beliefs as FACTUAL is usually rated lower than the other two.)",1072483200,6,1923,4.993769470404985
954358,4,6305006571,"Because of his place in American Pop Conciousness, the Dali Lama too often suffers from shallow treatment and cartoonish representation because of his association with famous personalities.  In reality, he is a serious religious figure and deserves serious treatment.  This movie is a serious and, I think, beautifully poetic attempt to tell the story of his youth through his escape from Tibet into exile as the Communist Chinese closed their grasp on his sad homeland.  The images are powerful and the Philip Glass score supports the visual means of telling the story very well.
I have no idea how much of the miraculous nature of the selection of Kundun as the Dali Lama or his remembering of his previous lives is based in perceived reality or is just poetry, but certainly the Dali Lama deserves some iconographical treatment.
For me, a most powerful scene occurs when Kundun has his last conversation with Mao and finally realizes his betrayal.  In this scene Mao tells him that religion is poison in a most callous and condescending manner.  In this, I see the emptiness of modern materialism and its inability to see anything of value in the spiritual and traditional.  There is blindness in materialism's view favoring the new and the present as necessarily being progress over the past.  It sees technology as always an improvement (it is the flip side of the coin of those who believe that all technology is soulless and evil).
This isn't an adventure film and certainly nothing like Scorsese's more famous and violent films.  But I think he has accomplished something beautiful here and I have enjoyed watching it several times.
""Seven Years in Tibet"" tells the same story a bit differently and less poetically and has the complication of the Brad Pitt's character being, well, a Nazi.  But I think seeing both movies adds to one's understanding rather than seeing either of them alone.",1062201600,10,1898,4.943396226415095

But this movie is about the part of his life most Westerners know very little (if anything) about. From his testing as a toddler to decide if he was the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama and his subsequent removal from the sole care of his parents to his teenaged dealing with being both spiritual leader to and student of the the elder Bhuddist Monks and their later, but still while he was quite young, flight to safety and exile from a homeland that they are clearly deeply connected to.

Apart of the terrific cinematography and the pleasure we can have to follow the life of the reincarnation of "" The Buddha of Compassion "", what's left of Martin in this movie ? Almost nothing. In fact, he is hidden behind his subject and leaves the keys of the house to the Dalai-Lama. That's respect, after all. And I respect it.

Yes, the Glass soundtrack is unique, even if (and I'm a Glass fan) it does err on the side of detachment overly much.
But the problems are just far, far too large to ignore.
First, we have the historical and political reality of Lama-ist Tibet that this movie barely even hints at.  For all of you who think that Tibet was some sort of Shangri-La prior to the invasion of the Chinese, do a Google on 'Tibetan serf'. You'll quickly discover that Lama-ist Tibet was a feudal society, with 95% of the population living as illiterate serfs or slaves.  The top 5% of society, who were more or less allowed to treat the commoners as disposable draft animals, consisted of landowners, the aristocracy, and....you guessed it.....monks.  Add in the CIA funding of the uprising against the Chinese, and you quickly realize that the Dalai Lama can be seen as a well-heeled theocrat whose drive for Tibetan nationalism cannot be divorced from a retrenchment to an ancient despotic regime.
Secondly, you have the portrayal of the Dalai Lama himself in the movie.  To put it simply, he's flawless.  He's not portrayed as a man so much as a demi-god.  He can do no wrong, commit no evil.  If he has a flaw, it's that in his purity and idealism he is a bit naive.  This glossy cardboard rendition leads to a bland, flat, dramaless character with whom the audience cannot connect. Every great hero has tragic flaws, and every great villain has a kernel of sympathy.  But not the Dalai Lama! Instead, we're given a spiritually perfect uber-being who, when all is said and none, comes across as pretty darn boring.
Had Scorsese made a movie about a spiritual, idealistic man caught between defending a despotic, slavish regime and selling-out to aggressive, god-less, brutal Chinese communists...with a little international politics and CIA intrigue mixed-in...we could have had a very interesting movie.
But, instead, he gave us Botoxified artprop: pretty on the surface, but only skin deep.",1055635200,50,2133,4.8646408839779
954362,5,6305006571,"I think this movie is simply astonishing. As most of the (positive) reviews have already mentioned, the stunning visuals, perfect musical score, and emphasis on religious pageantry are what makes this film great. However, I don't feel that these ""take away"" from the film or provide any sense of detachment, like some people have argued. Robert Ebert complained that the film provides no sense of the Dalai Lama as a man because it is so wrapped up in the myth of his reincarnation, but I disagree. Especially after the Chinese Communist regime gets involved, the Dalai Lama is depicted as very ""human,"" as he is reluctant to abandon the Tibetan people, who revere him, but is forced to concede that Tibet cannot resist their more powerful adversary. And the Chinese aren't depicted as monsters either, for those who would argue that the film is too one-sided. Some have complained about the acting, since Scorsese casted all largely unknown Tibetans, but I couldn't detect any weaknesses in that area. What Kundun does is beautifully depict the tragedy of this isolated kingdom being coerced to abandon its way of life and time-honored traditions. This may not be Scorsese's best, but it ranks right up there, and is certainly better than the Last Temptation of Christ, which dealt with similar themes.",1055203200,3,1303,4.981651376146789

I feel there were parts excluded from the Dalai Lama's life that shouldn't have been.  However, they covered the Dalai Lama's life from a baby until he moved to India very well.  Judging from outside research they did a very good job ""sticking to the script"".  I think they captured the setting and mood of the Dalai Lama and his people very well.

The acting of Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong is amazing, I fell in love with the compassion, thoughts and lines in this movie. The music is neither disturbing nor irritating, it simply was perfect. I recommend this video for anyone who want to catch a glimpse of tibetan buddhism imagery and just have a great time watching a film about the Dalai Lama.

954425,3,6305006571,"The costumes are beautiful, the cinematography is excellent, and this movie is visually breathtaking.  However, a personal story about the Dalai Lama it is not.  Buddhists are gentle and mild-mannered by nature, and this might have something to do with the fact that this movie lacks the emotional depth that we are accustomed to seeing in Martin Scorsese's movies.
The movie starts off with the discovery of the 14th Dalai Lama as a young boy in a distant village in Tibet.  He is taken from his home in order to be groomed to be the leader that he is destined to become.  He is taught the ways of the religion that he is to lead, and then he is forced to confront the tyranny of Chinese rule.  Since this movie is based on the life of the real Dalai Lama, it isn't too much of a spoiler to reveal that in the end he is forced to flee Tibet and seek refuge in India.
Frankly, I was expecting more out of this movie.  After all, a young boy is taken from his family and has the weight of an entire religion and country put on his shoulders, and all of this is narrated in a largely dispassionate and uninteresting way.  The audience is never able to feel the Dalai Lama's pain because we never really get to know him, and so we're left feeling a numb sort of apathy throughout the movie.
While I might have problems with the script and the way in which it is performed, I don't think I've ever seen a movie with better costumes and camera angles.  It's worth watching just for these reasons.",1041292800,2,1491,4.318996415770609

In the early scenes this underscores Kundun's remoteness from the secular world, but as the movie rolls on, Scorsese's eye for Eastern splendor overtakes the story of Tibet's struggle and the 18-year-old Kundun's growing response to it.  I share Scorsese's respect for the Dalai Lama, but I think there's a crippling Orientalist romance at work in this movie.  Would he treat a Western leader so uncritically?  A lot of love and passion clearly went into this production;  I wish it had dropped the dreamy filters and done justice to a very human tragedy.",1041206400,4,703,4.923728813559322

954428,4,6305006571,"It's amazing, glancing over the first page of reviews, the wide range of love/hate opinions on this film.  I don't actually feel terribly ""qualified"" to review this, since I don't actually know any of the history of China and Tibet and the life of the Dalai Lama, like many people here obviously do.  I bought the film mainly because of the Philip Glass score and the hope that I could get a start in learning more about the Dalai Lama and Buddhism.  In that sense, I think the film succeeds in bringing to the audience a glimpse of the life of a Buddhist monk and the environment where the Dalai Lama lived and grew up.
The critics are asking for the movie to explore issues and areas that are really not within the realm of possibility considering the time frame and the style of storytelling...
The music fits perfectly to the absolutely beautiful images found in every frame of the film.  The editing and camerawork are amazing, and convey an emotional impact without hitting you over the head.  Philip Glass is Philip Glass, and his score is just what you would expect if you are familiar with his music, and he does pepper his normal arpeggios and pulses with Tibetan instruments and sounds, to a very effective degree.  If you find that distracting, go listen to your John Williams CDs.
Many of the images reminded me also of the films Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, also scored by Philip Glass, and Baraka.  I just got my notification that Koy. and Pow. are being released in Septemeber on DVD after a REALLY long wait.  If you enjoyed Kundun, and liked the glimpse into the spirituality and different culture of Tibet, then you owe it to yourself to check those other films out as well.",1024704000,2,1694,4.604651162790698
954429,4,6305006571,"The majority of director Martin Scorsese's best liked movies have been about criminals or about people full of anger and potential violence. These include ""Casino"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Color of Money"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"" and his masterwork, ""Raging Bull"". He also made the brilliant, turn of the century romance, ""The Age of Innocence"".
""Kundun"" is his second attempt to tackle a spiritual subject. The first was ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", arguable the most controversial movie ever made about Christianity. It was so provocative, at least in theory, that it was never shown in many cities and towns.
Covering the life of the last Dalai Lama of Tibet from childhood to his exile, ""Kundun"" created a controversy of a different sort. It was deemed politically incorrect. Several decades ago, Tibet, which for a thousand years had been independent and peaceful, was taken over by the Communist Chinese. They slaughtered many civilians, as well as Buddhist priests and nuns, claiming they were simply taking over a distant part of China. The survivors were 'reeducated.' Today, Tibet exists only as a mythical, fabled land , which was ruled by the Dalai Lama, its spiritual leader. The people believed that this man was reincarnated over and over again. Whether you believe that or not, the important thing is that Tibetans believed that all problems could be solved by peaceful means.
Because China, as well as the rest of the world, are so much changed these days, the making of this movie was deemed by them to be insulting. In truth, ""Kundun"" dwells on the end of grand traditions more than it does on the moral values of the invaders. So, I suppose the controversy arose because, while China has changed drastically, it has no intention of letting go of Tibet.
It is an unusual motion picture, taken down a notch or two for a reason I will get to in a minute.
You will note that I have listed no cast credits. The posters for the film didn't either. This is because Scorsese, attempting to be as faithful as possible to the story, cast mainly actors of Tibetan heritage. These people came from two acting groups, one in New York, the other in India. The main character is well played by Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong. Since all of the names of the performers are equally exotic, they would be meaningless in selling the film to the public.
Philip Glass, a renowned composer of modern classical music, wrote a film score that fits exactly what the stunning visuals show.
From the standpoints of photography, music, and set and costume design, the film is a work of art. Unfortunately, Scorsese, like many other famous directors, took on a story which he appears not to have known how to approach. Steven Spielberg had the same problem with ""Amistad"", only to turn around and unleash the astounding ""Saving Private Ryan"" on an unsuspecting public.
In ""Kundun"", I felt that all its beauty could not overcome Scorsese's inability to bring real emotional power to subject matter that demanded him to do so. This makes it rather like an elegant coffee table book. That's the heavy, oversized kind of book filled with stunning photos and art. People rarely read the text in such a volume. With this movie, it is difficult to tell whether the its artistic merits overwhelmed the story or whether the story would have come off even less involving without the lavish trappings.",1017273600,5,3377,4.864583333333333

And yes, the frame is filled with visual splendor and Scorcese's mastery of cinematic composition and color is on full display, but somewhere along the way he forgot something called ""an interesting narrative"". The actual story of the Dalai Lama's struggle and exile IS in fact a fascinating tale, so this should have been a no-brainer. Using ""non-actors"" is always a gamble, and in this case an unfortunate decision. I think Scorcese got too hung up on his obvious reverence toward the subject, to the point of stifling his own creative license.

954490,5,6305006571,"Other than the original 1950's ""Seven Years in Tibet,"" which offered incredible first hand footage of H.H. the Dalai Lama from Heinrich Himmler, Scorsese's ""Kundun"" is the most definitive film on the life, trials, and tribulations of Tibet's Spritiual and Political ruler.
Scorsese's skills, as always, are first rate in the film. The photography, amazing for the original vhs or theater version, is even more amazing in the dvd version. Of course, the fact that Tibet is a beautiful country helps, but the angles and shots that Scorsese uses only accentuates the natural beauty all the more.
The film itself chronicles the life of H.H. The Dalai Lama from his discovery at the age of 2, the meticulous tests that go with the Buddhist traditions to be sure that Kundun is indeed the 14th Dalai Lama, etc. through to the dark days of post WWII, where Mao-led China declares that Tibet is a Chinese province and forcably annexes Tibet, to H.H. having to leave Tibet for the safer lands of India. All parts of the film are historically accurate, as H.H. lent his cooperation to the script and film itself. The co-operation of H.H. gives the film absolute legitimacy.
Scorsese's portrait of Kundun is that on an enlightened monk (which indeed, a Dalai Lama is), and some people will argue that the human side of H.H. is not painted in the film. I disagree with that assertion- indeed, the scene where H.H. dreams of being amongst monks who were killed for their pacifism, is an all too real image of absolute humanity. The fact that H.H. wanted to stay in Tibet and not flee to India is another sign of his humanity. While Scorsese looks apon H.H. as a spiritual leader, he does not leave out the human factor at all.
The film is boosted by a brilliant score by American minimalist composer Philip Glass, whose music accentuates the otherworldly quality of certain scenes, and keeps the overall dramatic nature of the film intact.
If you see one film of H.H. the Dalai Lama, choose ""Kundun."" Scorsese's work is brilliant, as is the acting by the cast of Tibetan unknowns, which adds more credence to the overall experience. Add Philip Glass and H.H. himself to the mix, and the overall experience is unparalleled.",989539200,,2209,4.7702349869451695
954491,5,6305006571,"Let's get one thing straight off the bat. This is NOT a movie for the MTV generation. Martin Scorsese is not interested in hyperstimulating you with quick edits, hyper music or constantly changing visuals. Kundun is a magnificently measured meditation on a culture of meditation and contemplation. Does that mean it's boring? Not for someone interested in a serious look at another culture, its beliefs, and the price it pays to preserve them from an adversary. Beautifully shot and acted, with a score that is meant to entrance rather than draw attention to itself, I would argue Kundun is one of the best films of the 1990s, and maybe of all time.",989280000,3,649,4.803571428571429

There were surprisingly few violent scenes, although the ones that are included might be too disturbing for smaller children.
Visually, this film is absolutely gorgeous. Each scene is arranged perfectly and there are dozens of beautifully filmed slices of Tibetan culture. Widescreen on DVD, the film was especially eye-popping.
This movie also got me more interested in Tibetan history. It also presented a few cursory snatches of Buddhist thought, but not enough to satisfactorily explain how it feels to be Tibetan.

954496,5,6305006571,"One of the beauties of KUNDUN comes from the way it preserves and recreates a culture that is now almost extinct, of a Tibet which is now almost completely destroyed. And it is a beautiful culture, where almost every  detail is related with spiritual value, the very values that our contemporary culture is in the verge of completely losing them, yet still so essential to human life. To see this film is, first and foremost, like a meditation.
Dante Ferretti's design recreating faithfully the traditional costumes and building with a great reality, with Roger Deakins beautiful cinematography (which depth, nuances and richness of colors  are so beautifully transferred on this DVD), as well as Philip Glass's music, make KUNDUN a visual poem. Also must be noted is Thelma Schoonmaker's complex editing which explores and reveals the complexity of the story and giving them a beautiful, almost musical rhythm. According to Mr. Scorsese, the climatic Sand-Mandhala montage sequence that cross-cut the Dalai Lama's exile to India and a religious ceremony was her idea, and it brings the film up to an incredible spiritual level.  Yet, Scorsese does not show Tibet as an idyllic and idealized society. By using the young Dalai Lama's point of view as a narrative strategy throughout the film, by showing almost everything through  his eyes, the film also glimpses at the complexity of the Tibetan society and its own problems; ""I didn't know monks has guns"" ""Is there a prison in Potala"" says the 12 years old Dalai Lama.
Violence, or human pain to be more exact, is also present in this film. An amazing nightmare sequence shows the Dalai Lama in the midle of thousands of dead monks. A typical Scorsese image? Well, in fact, it is a faithful recreation of a dream that the Dalai Lama himself has told the filmmakers. In this sense, KUNDUN is also a documentary as much as it is a beautifully created dramatic piece. A particulary poignant moment is when the Dalai Lama gives audience to his people, an old woman starts saying something in Tibetan, as if she was posessed by her traumatic experience. This scene, according to Mr. Scorsese, actually happened as they started to shoot the scene. They put a photo of the real Dalai Lama, and the woman started to talk like that. All the filmmakers did was to film her, and leave it as it is in the film, without even a translation. We can't tell what she says, but we understand the deep sorrow, the truth of her emotion. This is indeed one of the most emotional scene Scorsese, the ultimate filmmaker of emotiin, has ever presented us.
As different as it may seems on the surface level, KUNDUN also explores the familiar Scorsese themes, of the dilemma between religious spiritual values of human trying to be good, and the harsh reality of the world they live in and their own human vulnerabilities inside them; a conflict that has been always present in his films since WHO'S THAT KNOCKING ON MY DOOR  and MEAN STREETS, the dilemma that drove Travis Bickle to a burst of bloody violence, the demon inside that Jake La Motta had to fight, the conflict of divinity versus humanity in Jesus.
But KUNDUN takes a different direction. Instead of being obsessed with his own dilemma that drives him near self-destruction (as did so many Scorsese heroes), the Dalai Lama goes beyond that to become the human incarnation of not divinity, but of ultimate compassion. It is amazing how, after witnessing so much violence and anger, he could reach such a state of peace in mind.
Most of the people in the film are non-actors; real Tibetans (the Dalai Lama's mother is played by one of his own niece), and though their performance are not as dramatic as De Niro, Keitel, Pesci, Dafoe, Day Lewis and Pfeifer et all, they bring a truthfulness to the screen.
Mr. Scorsese told me in an interview last year ""It was almost like a prayer to make this movie. And my life has changed, to certain extent"". I believe this film has the same effects, to certain extent, to us viewers as well.
The film also carries an important political-- Mr. Scorsese says he prefer the word ""human""-- message: ""Non-violence is the only revolutionary idea left to us"",  says Martin Scorsese.",970790400,129,4201,4.779614325068871
954497,5,6305006571,"This is one of my top five favorite films of all time.  Scorsese is so versatile.  He can go from the brilliance of Raging Bull to the brilliance of Goodfellas to the understated brilliance of Kundun and not miss a beat.
Not many people saw this movie because of its spiritual subject matter and its lack of big name stars.  THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE MOVIE SO GREAT.  Scorsese used actual Tibetans for the role.  They exuded so much reverence for the subject matter and made the movie seem so real.  The movie teaches an incredible about Tibetan Buddhism and Asian politics as well.
The Cinematography is the finest of any film ever. Period.  When they show the chopping of the dead body or the mandala of dead monks it is awe inspiring.  The Tibetan landscapes are unbelievably incandescent as well.  Seeing the monks sweep the sand of the mandalas away after intricately constructing them is amazing.
You must see this movie.  It is somewhat slow, but it is enlightening.  Scorsese treats this subject matter exactly how it was meant to be treated.  If you haven't seen this, you are cheating yourself.

954498,2,6305006571,"Watching this again on DVD, I've grown to like it a bit more since seeing it in the theatre and being almost bored to death by it (especially in the second half which just drags on and on). It's certainly a technical achievement of the highest order with endless dazzling shots, but artistically it's still flat: it could've, and should've been much more than it is. I still like every other Scorsese film, including ""Cape Fear,"" ""New York, New York,"" and ""Boxcar Bertha"" better than this and don't think it has anything profound to say that wasn't also said, much more economically in the less pretentious Hollywood entertainment of ""7 Years in Tibet."" And ""7 Years"" managed to also incorporate some of the differences between East-and-West and how the two regions see each other and learn from each other and a mountain-climbing adventure into its confines while ""Kundun"" just investigates in poetic detail the viewpoint of one man (Kundun himself) filtered through a certain all-encompassing 'hip' viewpoint of Americans about him as represented by Scorsese, Glass,  and Mathison. I don't exactly share that viewpoint and maybe that's why I can't really enjoy this film to the hilt; it offers me no choice for my own interpretation that comes directly from the substance of the film itself and not from what I think about how it was made.
The main aesthetic problem I have with enjoying ""Kundun"" is with Philip Glass's music: it's not bad for some ambience in small doses and used in the right places but in large doses it becomes unbearably repititious and just plain weak.  I couldn't  stand ""Koyanoquatsi: Life out of Balance"" for the same reason, though I loved the beautiful images. And why Scorsese, who's ten times the director that Glass is a composer, would want to fit his whole film ONLY into a Glassian 'New Age' perspective by using so much of his Jive music, I don't know. On most of his other films he uses all kinds of music for different scenes, not here: it's all Philip Glassed into your head from beginning to end. A little eastern-sounding-classical, some Vangelis or Peter Gabriel could've helped, mixed in with the beautiful traditional music of the land itself like the brilliant new Siamese-Fusion soundtrack of the silent classic ""Chang,"" (available on the DVD)  maybe some Brian Eno, who knows, the possibilities were endless, but Scorsese only went with whatever variety Glass could come up with; I guess he wanted a hypnotic score: well, he got it! It hypnotizes me right into total annoyance. That particular Western idea or perspective of Tibet and China and the East, that sensibility represented by the Philip Glasses of the world is too shallow to warrant an entire film cut to it. Scorsese directs a filmed ballet of Philip Glass's ""Kundun"" would've been a more accurate title for this film, because that's how you're forced to see it unless you turn the volume off. There's no 'mysterious neutrality"" there where the music doesn't direct your interpretation: it totally does, and in a not too deep a way, just enough to get a couple of brain cells tickled comfortably and no more (although Scorsese probably thought it was 'neutral,' and conducive to audience involvement with the film when he used it).
Also, Scorsese's film concentrates too much on the clash of the 'non-violent' pacifist philosophy of the Buddhist Monks and the violent nature of the entire living world when it's obvious it's a no-win situation. You either exercise your right to defend yourself againt people who choose to act like animals and coerce and oppress you or you disappear into a void. The problem of 'physical violence' is very simple: the right of self-defence against anyone who initiates violence against you; it's the problem of 'spiritual violence' that's the profound one and at which ""Kundun"" merely hints at.  The million and one ways that you can do violence to your spirit by following irrational philosohies, religions, and superstitions. Scorsese, while he hints at this in earlier scenes, makes pretty much clear toward the end of the film that his attitude is one of reverence towards the irrational thinking of these monks simply because they refuse to defend themselves. Jean-Jacques Annaud, on the other hand, with just one scene of Kundun's followers saving all the worms before they can build a movie theatre with Brad Pitt/Heinrich Harrar in ""7 Years,"" dismisses the harmful aspects of the whole religion as such utter absurdity, that only a lunatic would decide to follow its tenets to the letter.",969408000,8,4541,4.946264744429882

It almost seems disrespectful to Tibetan Buddhism, (at least to me),  and  also strikes me as dangerous. As spiritually starved as so many in the West  are, we tend to take a ""cafeteria"" approach to spirituality and  dine on whatever the religion-du-jour is.

Much is hinted at, implied and alluded to out of respect for the viewer's intelligence and ability to creatively visualize. The music, editing, acting, direction, and cinematography  are truly inspiring. KUNDUN is truly a BRILLIANT  masterpiece!",956361600,,304,5.733333333333333
954575,4,6305006571,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I had very high expectations knowing the Dalai Lama's connections with Hollywood (for example, Richard Gere, Steven Seagall). He has visited and talked with Hollywood's brass  many times and I figured many people in Hollywood would be intimately  familiar with this fascinating man's life starting with his very birth.  Also, since the name of the movie is: ""Kundun"", not ""The  Plight of Tibet"", I figured this movie would be about His Holiness,  the 14th Dalai Lama.
I have read a few chapters from a book which  intimately described the beginnings of the Dalai Lama's life and I own  several video cassettes of him and his teachings. The director of this film  (Scorsese) has little faith in this kid's ability to act in my opinion.  Take the scene where the Chinese send their representative to negotiate  Tibet's ""Sovereignty"". There are 3 such meetings in the film.  During the first 2 meetings, Kundun is sitting on the throne, and a monk  next to him does all the talking. Kundun didn't say a word. Not one single  solitary word! Here is the ""Spiritual Leader"" of this country and  he cannot say one word in defense of his country?  In real life, since he  was only a young teen at the time, he probably didn't have much input or  say because he wasn't very experienced in those matters. But why even have  him in the scene if he's not going to say anything?  It's only in the 3rd  and last meeting when Kundun is alone with a Chinese Representative does he  finally say some words, and from my vague recollection, it was a few weak  cliched lines.
Scorsese could have done a much better job in the  beginning of the film when the monks initially found the Dalai Lama's  reincarnation. Here is a 4 year old kid, who is a perfectly normal little  child living in a small village on the outskirts of Tibet. His mother has  had dreams of spirits talking with her although everything else seems  perfectly ordinary. A group of monks and former servants who have  deliberately disguised themselves have set out on this house to test the  Dalai Lama. They bring artifacts from the previous Dalai Lama's life and  ask him to identify which ones were his. Of course he picks the right ones.  He is also asked to identify the monks who were present before him. This is  not an easy thing to do! These monks are in disguise! And this kid has  never even seen them in his life! Of course the kid remembers all of them  and knows exactly who they are. If this happened in America, this would be  front page news. But Scorsese does a poor job of covering this aspect of  his life. All that was shown in the film was the kid picking out artifacts  of the previous Dalai Lama's. No dreams are shown, the viewers are not  aware that the monks who have come to test him are actually in disguise,  and Kundun is not required to identify the monks. I don't think this is  beyond the comprehension of the viewers. People aren't *that* dumb! They  can recognize incredible feats of spirituality when they see it.
Incidentally, the Dalai Lama was constantly tested upon his arrival in  the Potala Palace and he was given extensive tests to prove he was indeed  the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama on almost a daily basis (even  years after it had been established he was indeed the 13th reincarnation)  but this was not covered in the film.
None of this is was really that  important though. I really wanted to see the Dalai Lama, the future Nobel  Peace Prize Winner. The Spiritual Leader of Tibet. I wanted to get to know  HIM. I wanted to know what he liked, what he didn't like, was he a brash  kid or a rebellious teenager? It would have been nice if they had gotten  some stories from the monks about any special relationships he had with  other people. I wanted to learn something about him that I didn't know  before. There was nothing in the film about this.
Scorsese did an  outstanding job in using real monks during Buddhist Ceremonies. I'm  Buddhist and I can appreciate what goes on here. I knew he was using real  monks because I have participated in many ceremonies myself.
Scorsese  also does an outstanding job depicting the Chinese cruelty that went on  during the invasion of Tibet in which millions of people were killed. I've  seen some of the real life footage that was smuggled out of Tibet and can  tell you that the sheer terror depicted in the movie was no fluke. The  Chinese were savages and beat monks to a pulp, they showed no mercy  whatsoever. It makes me sad because when I see the Potala Palace and all  the people who visit there on a yearly basis, they think, ""Oh how  cool! How nice! This is the place where the Dalai Lama used to live!""  But they don't realize the Dalai Lama *SHOULD* still be living there. It's  still HIS home! They have no more business being there than the Chinese do.  It's a holy, sacred place.
That's why this film is such a let down for me  is that Scorsese went through such tremendous pains to make things as  realistic as possible. The Dalai Lama is a very down to earth man and is  fairly accessible. There have been many books written about him. It would  not have been difficult at all to get detailed information on his life.  Scorsese could have made the film infinitely more interesting if he had  covered perhaps a special relationship the Dalai Lama had or something  funny happening to him rather than portraying the kid as a nerd, tinkering  with clocks and radios all the time.",954374400,,5485,4.516819571865444
954576,5,6305006571,"As war films go, `The Deer Hunter' is a unique work and an impossible template for would-be imitators to use. Director Michael Cimino takes a straightforward premise and complicates it so thoroughly that the end  product can be nothing else but a true imitation of reality. His picture is  a first in that it demonstrates slices of lives before, during and after  they go into the oven.
  Three Russian-American steelworkers from  Philadelphia go off to serve their country in Vietnam. After enduring  unbelievably sadistic treatment from their Viet Cong captors, the trio  manage to get out.....  ......only to find  that there is no escape from war.
  Homing in on De Niro and Walken  (the third guy gets backseated early), Cimino's cameras milk each scene dry  of its humanity. De Niro finds that he is able to try for some semblance of  normality back in Philadelphia, albeit as a changed man. However, Walken's  character has popped all his screws and is drawn back to the Russian  Roulette tables of Saigon by his maniacal suffering.  Only when he  finds that Walken has being sending large cash conscience gifts to the  legless third member of the original trio does De Niro feel hopeful that he  can find his friend. He returns to the self-destructing city in search of  him and finds something so horrifying that he chooses to gamble with his  own life.
  Clocking in at over three hours, Cimino's epic  wonderwork earned several Oscars for its contributors. Ultra strong  performances are pulled from the cast and the realism never lets up during  the entire run of the film. Every aspect of these men's lives comes to the  camera which is a double-edged blade. On the one hand, Cimino's lack of  subject concentration ensures that the characters and the events that  befall them are extremely plausible; on the other hand, sometimes this  constant microscope on life makes for tedium. Given the novel feel of `The  Deer Hunter', though, the negative aspects of Cimino's over zealous style  is excusable. No, the reality factor in this movie is so great that it can  push the viewer to tears. As a whole, the movie can't be construed as  overlong, either, because it's far too mind engaging and poignant.
  Perhaps it's owing to its identity as the first Vietnam War drama film  that `The Deer Hunter' is so powerful. At any rate, it made a name for its  director. Cimino was trail blazing here in the strictest sense and nothing  like it has come since. Future Vietnam pictures would eschew the human  element in favour of the violence only.  A sad ending, a beautiful  soundtrack and spectacular location photography provide the jewels for this  crown of a work. Even so, the dimensions and dynamics of `The Deer Hunter'  were as good as impossible for Cimino to replicate in his later films. He  tried to do it in the Western `Heaven's Gate' two years later and nearly  sank MGM studios.
  `The Deer Hunter' is the archetypal War Drama.  It had to be done so Cimino committed it to film. It can never be done  again or transfused into another format. This film is a monolith of  Humanity on tape. It needs to be seen by those who seek to understand the  darker sides of the human condition and owned by those who already do.",954288000,7,3237,4.726618705035971
954577,5,6305006571,"There is an amazing scene in Kundun, where the Dalai Lama is leaving Tibet, getting into a boat that will commence his journey to refuge in India. The moon has backlit an impressive mountain range, beyond the  water's edge, and there are still stars visible in the sky.  As the boat  drifts off, it looks like the Dalia Lama is floating into the stars beyond  the mountains. This is one of many incredible images in this riviting  film.
 I give Scorcese credit for using Tibetan actors (who turn out to  be superb), and paying such meticulous attention to detail and visual  imagery. My only concern is that the director has such reverence for the  central character of this film, that he becomes somewhat distant -- a  larger than life figure who is simply beyond the mortal lives that the rest  of us live.  Yet I have read that the Dalai Lama is anything but aloof to  people around him -- full of humanity and with both feet planted solidly on  the ground.
 Even so, this is a magnificent film, and it has a strong  political message.  After viewing it, one will be inspired to take the  ""next steps"" and do such things as register protest with U.S.  foreign policy that turns its head from the atrocities still going on in  Tibet.  Another step is to practice peaceful and harmonious living with  those who are close by.  Surely, a movie that inspires us to do such things  is... GREAT.",954288000,4,1391,4.516129032258065

954619,5,6305006571,"If you watch this film patiently (because it's long), and hang on every word that's said, you will be left dumbstruck. This film is so real it is like a documentary. Here are the details: the film is divided into 3 parts.  The first part depicts three ordinary men (Mike, Steve and Nick) living in  Pennsylvania, going about life just as you and I do. They live as if there  is no tomorrow: having a good time, getting drunk, Mike getting married.  This part lasts 1 hour. The film then moves up a gear, and takes you to the  other end of the spectrum of their life: playing Russian Roulette against  each other forced upon them by the Vietnese. The Russian Roultete scene,  which is carried out in detail and leaves you sweating, lasts about 20  minutes. In the third part (post Vietnam) the film moves into top gear. De  Niro (Mike) returns to Pennsylvania a traumetised man who is now far aand  distant from his friends. He eventually tracks down his collegues who are  also broken by their experience (I'm not saying what has happened to them).  This part lasts about 1 hour. The film  is so moving to me because of the  way the three men appear experts in Russian Roullete after their ordeal -  they are able to pick up a gun and point it to their heads as if they know  they will win. I could write much more. Don' be put off by the slow start -  it's necessary in order to see the contrast when they move to Vietnam.

954621,5,6305006571,"Having read the previous 49 reviews, what can I add? There are maybe three ways to review a film: on craft (how the film medium is used), on content (is this story worth telling?), and for a ""true story"" film, is  it true? If you are a student of film (officially or not) and know  something about Scorsese, you MUST see this film. Very, very few films  since the invention of ""talkies"" have used the medium as  brilliantly. Mathison's script, Glass' music, Deakins' cinematography, the  incredible amateur acting: On the craft score, this is Scorsese's greatest  work. The story of a young boy raised to be the spiritual - and forced to  be the political - leader of his country may not attract everyone.  There's  nothing for it: that is the storyline of one of the greatest films ever  made. As for ""true stories,"" one reviewer compared Scorsese to  David Lean, who made ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  As a lifelong student  of history and cinema, I can say that all ""true stories"" must  compress events and characters, must make one incident or one dialog stand  for many, and that all must be colored by the historical viewpoint of their  tellers.  Both David Lean and Martin Scorsese have clearly tried to capture  their subjects sincerely and represent ""truth"" with all their  skill and within the limits of their medium. Scorsese has let the Tibetans  tell this story through him. Buddhists can usually be counted on for  greater than average objectivity. From everything I have read and all I  have talked to about Lawrence and about Tibet, Scorcese has done a far  better job of representing history than Lean. If you have any interest in  film or Tibet, see this in widescreen. It will almost certainly be the best  film about the Dalai Lama ever to be made.",949968000,42,1761,4.695081967213115

Geez, I  would've thought they would get past that after a week or so (and he makes  the common Western error of translating the first noble truth as  ""suffering"" instead of ""sorrowful impermanence"" or a  like phrase).

Scorcese has always been known for the constantly maintained pace of his films, tracking shots  and quick-fire dialogue. So this makes it all the more interesting when he  decides to tackle in the Dalai Lama, a subject who is almost defined by his  stillness. The film is a resounding success due to the directors restraint.  He clearly feels some reverance for the Dalai Lama and given his story  rightly so. This film is a fascinating study of a culture that few of us in  the west know much about but more importantly this is a truly inspirational  film.  One of the main reasons this film works so well is the Phillip Glass  score which i bought after seeing the film. Without the score the  necessarily slow pace of much of the film may have dragged but the music  adds a sense of real grandeur to the incredible cinematography. In short if  you are one of the apparent minority who thought Age of Innocence was  amongst Scorcese's best work then you won't be disappointed by Kundun, a  film which takes its director to a new level as an artist.

In the movie a boy is believed to be the 14th Dalai Lama. The two year old boy is put to a test to choose his items which where items that belonged to the prior Dalai Lama. The young boy picks the right items, and he is then perceived to be the next Dalai Lama. The movie then shows the boys coming of age, and his growth in both leaderships and religion. Then when he is a young adult the Chinese communists try to say that Tibet was a part of the traditional China. The Chinese start to invade, and are fine at first, but when Tibetans try to resist the Chinese communist control the Chinese communist turn violent to get them to conform. That is when the 14th Dalai Lama has to try to fix things. So the 14th Dalai Lama decides to visit Mao Zedong in Beijing, China. Dalai Lama insists changes need to be made, and that  is when Mao Zedong says that ""religion Is poison"". Dalai Lama then leaves and goes back to Tibet where he learns that the  situation has gotten much worse. He finds out that the Chinese want to kill him. So then Dalai Lama decides to flee the Tibet at night time with the rest of his staff. They were disguises, and sneak out in the darkness. This movie relates to World Religions, because it has a huge part based on the Buddhist religion. The Buddhist people worship the Dalai Lama, and believe that he is reincarnated just like he is in the movie. A lot of the religious beliefs depicted in the movie are the exact same as in real Buddhist beliefs. For instance, Buddhist that all living creators are intertwined. This is seen when the Buddhist chop the bodies up, and leave them for the birds to eat the remains. The monks were also depicted accurately by the way they dress, and the way they act.

The movie also showed some aspect of Tibetan religion where they look for the new Dalai Lama who would lead their people and made the people look up to him as the spiritual leader.",1523145600,,1598,4.2947019867549665

7881215,4,6305006571,"Martin Scorseses film, Kundun is set in Tibet during a time when China sought to conquer the country. The storyline itself focuses on the discovery of the 14th Dalai Lama by several Tibetan lamas.  A young child, born unto a family in Amdo is considered to be the primary selection for the title of Dalai Lama, but must first pass an examination to be accepted.  After the young child passes the test, the lamas move his family into a palace while they await his aging transition.

Reting, the ruler who originally had the vision about the child, takes time to comfort the child and explain the history and origin of the 1st Dalai Lama. Many individuals question the legitimacy of Retings selection throughout the earlier parts of the film.  Ultimately, Reting is removed from power, imprisoned, and left to die. As the 14th Dalai Lama comes of age, the film centers on the looming Chinese invasion. Tibet requests the aid of many foreign nations in the wake of such events, but is left to defend itself against Chinas interests (Communism).  As Chinas presence increased, their stance became clearer and more violently oppressive.  This stance is emboldened when Chinas intention to kill the Dalai Lama is established. Upon this realization, the Dalai Lama and his family flee to India for safety. The film ends stating that the Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet after such events.

The films connection to world religions is apparent in its presentation of Tibetan Buddhism from various perspectives. For one, the film depicts the struggles of religious persecution from outside interests and nations. Across the world, many religions face tremendous scrutiny, oppression, and violence. This film takes a piece of the history of Buddhism, and delineates how such events have affected its mobility and impact.  Kundun also prioritizes the depiction of Tibets religious identity during this particular time with precision and sensitivity.  The values and beliefs of Buddhism are carefully utilized within the story, but in a manner thats educational about the religion itself.",1522886400,,2083,5.102941176470588
7881216,5,6305006571,"The film Kundun starts with lamas who are disguised and are in search for the 14th Dalai Lama. What they find is a young boy who they believe to be the 14th Dalai Lama. It is also important to note that the movie starts in Tibet. The monks and teachers proceeded to teach the boy about Buddhism even though he was a reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama. The 14th Dalai Lama however very quickly faces a large problem at a young age. The chines government wants to take over the country of Tibet. If this was to happen Tibet would no longer be independent and not be able to practice their religion. The Dalai Lama find out also that the Chinese want him dead because they do not believe in Buddhism. Since Buddhism teaches nonviolence the Dalai Lama flees to India in order to avoid violence to escalate. All in all, I enjoyed watching Kundun and learning more about Tibetian Buddhism and the 14th Dalai Lama.

I think this movie relates to world religions because for one it a religious movie that follows the life of the 14th Dalai Lama of Buddhism. The Dalai Lama is very significant because in Tibet the Dalai Lama governs the country. This was until the Chinese invaded Tibet and took control of the country forcing the 14th Dalai Lama to flee. This movie also related to world religions because it displays a lot of the religious tension between different cultures. The communist Chinese government in the 1950's wanted to take control of Tibet but many Tibetans protested. Thousands of these peaceful protesters were killed. The Tibetans did not retaliate because many practiced Buddhism which taught nonviolence what the best answer. In conclusion, the movie Kundu related to world religion because we learn more about Buddhism and its practices. It also related to world religion because we learn about the 14th Dalai Lama and his significance for Tibetian Buddhism.",1519344000,,1879,4.781538461538462
7881217,5,6305006571,"Dont get me wrong, I love Martin Scorsese and think he is a great filmmaker. But sometimes watching a MS film, I think Im seeing a glorified music video. For example, in a bar scene in Mean Streets, MS plays Jumping Jack Flash. Now, what possible relation does Jumping Jack Flash have to a movie about small-time Italian gangsters? Or another bar scene in The Departed. The Allman Brothers is softly playing in the background. Whats the connection? Many times the music does match the action on the scene. More often times it does not.

Not with Kundun.

The rolling, undulating rhythms of Phillip Glass are in perfect synch with this movie. The music is transcendent because the subject is transcendent. This is a movie about the Dalai Lama. Glasss music will take you higher. It moves the movie along. As good a movie that it is, the music is almost better than the film. MS wisely chose relatively unknown actors to play the roles in this movie. The music, with the events depicted in this film, produces a huge impact. Such that after the movie ends, you will be thinking about the subject and feeling the experience well thereafter.

Needless to say, highly recommended.",1519171200,,1175,4.721951219512195
