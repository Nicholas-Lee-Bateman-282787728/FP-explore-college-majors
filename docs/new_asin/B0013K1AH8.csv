I popped it in to see what special features and I was surprised to see a sub menu for the special features. When I clicked it it just said ""NONE!"" really big on the screen. I was glad to see that amazon has not disappointed me and cares about me as a loyal costumer who uses his solid gold credit card. This DVD is really worth $853293.00 because it taught me everything about the Halloween Cars. The only thing was there was a bit of scariness. I was #sp00ked4days upon days. I guess it was #2sp00ky4me!",1398124800,,631,4.266666666666667
