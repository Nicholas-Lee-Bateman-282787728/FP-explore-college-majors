501579,1,6302714192,"I bought this video as an avid fan of Webber, but this video is ridiculous. For one thing the video has a tremendously out of date look to it. It looked more like bad kareoke videos than to any contemporary music  videos. It's more like a Sarah Brightman showcase and I love Sarah but this  gets out of hand with her constantly mugging through 70% of the songs. Get  the Royal Albert Hall collection which is fantastic. I watch that one time  and time again and yet I'm embarrassed to have this one on my shelf.",922233600,,511,4.291666666666667

501689,5,6302714192,"This is a must have for any Andrew Lloyd Webber fan  I't s a great video with short musical vidios on it. Each number done so wonderfully.  Sarah Brightman Michael Bal and Michael Crawford particually shine in it.  On eof my favorite numbers, Is ""Music of the Night,"" done by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.  It's so beautifully done, truly romantic.  The entire vidio is entertaining and lovely to watch.  It deserves all the stars it can  get.",1031011200,,451,4.705128205128205
501690,5,6302714192,"As with other writers, this video is a boost to Sarah Brightman, but that having been said, it also contains Michael Ball and his signature song ""Love Changes Everything"".  I've had the video since day one, and it's well worth it.  The duet with Jose Carreras ""Amigos Para Siempre"" is excellent.  This video is a *must* for those of us who are ALW fans.",994723200,6,353,4.484375
501691,5,6302714192,"This video is excellent and showcases some of the best interpreters of the music written by Andrew Lloyd Webber (up to Aspects of Love).  The premiere  interpreter is of course Sarah Brightman, though some would argue with  this.  Most of the selections have her in it and the span almost 10 yrs  (about 1984-92).  Her renditions of Anything But Lonely and Tell Me On A  Sunday are paticulary noteworthy as is of course Phantom of the Opera and  Pie Jesu (with Paul Miles Kingston).  But everything on this video is  terrific!",966988800,20,526,4.681318681318682
501692,4,6302714192,I haven't seen this as of yet but I know that anything to do with Andrew Lloyd Webber has got to be good! I love all of his musicals and I'm now eager to see anything with his name of it!  I'll take a chance and say that  it is good!,964137600,4,233,3.549019607843137
501693,5,6302714192,"Please advise asap where i could buy the video of The Phantom of the Opera played with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford or Andrew LLoyd Webber. I really would like to find it here in Australia because i'm fond of it and  i've been looking everywhere without any success. We use The pal video  system but whatsoever i really would like to find it, could someone help me  with it? thanks and best regards.

501694,4,6302714192,"This video I thought was very good. A tad bit corny in some places, and I have to agree andrew's place is in theatre, and not videos. But if you love Sarah Brightman, phantom of the opera, or micheal crawford. Then you need  to get this video. There is only one music video with micheal in it, but it  is a reinactment with sarah brightman of music of the night, and is very  good. It adentical to what happens on stage in the play. Sarah brightman  does six other videos, one which is phantom of the opera. The song is a  different one than the one we have today, and micheal hadn't been hired  yet. The song is a little more on the dark. obsessive side than the love  song it was made into. Put if you love Phantom of the opera, and don't mind  changes, than you need to get this video. the other videos with sarah  brightman are beautiful, and it's fun seeing her younger.",937440000,6,875,4.191616766467066
501695,1,6302714192,"Well, this might as well have been titled Sarah Brightman and friends. If I hadnt loved the songs so much I would have been turned off by the cheesy videos within the first thirty seconds... Michael Crawford, Michael Ball  and Jason Donovan were wonderful but whoever the genius was that told Steve  Harley he could sing needs to get his/her ears checked. I recommend passing  on this video and buying ""The Very Best of Andrew Lloyd Webber""  on CD which has virtually all of the same songs but you get Michael  Crawford singing Phantom with Sarah.",931392000,,547,4.65625
501696,5,6302714192,"If you're buying this because you're a Michael Ball fan, you won't be dissapointed. In fact, you'll bow in front of your TV and chant ""I'm not worthy!"" at the end of ""Love Changes Everything"". I did  that. Seriously. If you're buying this for Sarah Brightman, you'll get a  collection of some of the cheesiest orchestrations and backgrounds  (""All I Ask of You"" is a hoot) that you'll ever see. It really  should be called ""Sarah Brightman- The Premiere Collection  Encore"" with special guests Michael Ball, Jason Donovan, etc, etc. It  really is a good video, though, if you keep in mind this stuff was  fashionable in the 80's, but ""Oh What a Circus"" just HAS to go.",930787200,2,668,4.610169491525424

My father found this used, I watched it, and now I'm going to send it to my best friend for Christmas.  I know she will get a kick out of it.  We are all musical theater fans, but this video goes too far. The choreography is the cheesiest thing ever.  The costuming is hilarious.  I understand it was made in the early 90's, but the directors and actors simply take themselves too seriously.  To the point of being laughable.  Wow!",1134518400,,521,4.309278350515464
7830126,5,6302714192,"This is a great DVD if you are a broadway fan.  Why?

1.  This is one of the DVDs where you see Sarah Brightman at her best!  She is much younger here and thus her voice is MUCH better than in the ALW Royal Albert Hall DVD.  Although I have seen her in other DVD concerts, I was not a fan of Sarah Brightman UNTIL i watched this DVD.  Her Pie Jesu rendition is enough to make the whole DVD a worthwhile purchase. Charlotte Church is nowhere near Sarah Brightman at her peak. It could make you cry.

2.  You get to see Michael Crawford and Michael Ball in their younger years singing Broadway songs.  How good and rare is that?",1125014400,10,626,4.107438016528926
