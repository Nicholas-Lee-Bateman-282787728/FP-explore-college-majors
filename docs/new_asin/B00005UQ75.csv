7955112,5,B00005UQ75,"Chen Kuan Tai is the master, on the run from the 3 Evils (including the man with a blade in the braid!), who have severely injured him in a scuffle. Yuen Tak (aka Yuan Tak on the back of the MediaBlaster's dvd case) plays the student who takes him in, and after being bullied continuously, the Master takes him under his wing. Overall, very good story, with some of the best actors in the genre. Lau Hok Nin is excellent as the school master who hates Chen Kuan Tai and takes it out on Yuen Tak.

Directed by Lu Chun Ku, 1980. aka 3 Evil Masters

I own the Media Blasters/ Tokyo Shock/ Celestial version that contains two dvds, Heroes Two and The Master (aka 3 Evil Masters). The version is presented beautifully in 16:9 widescreen, with excellent audio in either English dubbing or Chinese, and there's also subtitles available. 96 minutes. The dvd quality gets a 5 out of 5. These are the best of the best-- anything by Celestial is top-notch.

The film is very good, and stars Chen Kuan Tai- one of my favorite kung fu actors (also in Opium and the Kung Fu Master with Ti Lung). Some of the dialogue is very clever, and the English dubbing made me laugh out loud more than once.

Overall, the film deserves a 4.0 out of 5 stars, but if you get the Celestial version, it's really a 4.5 out of 5. Watching old kung fu in pristine quality is what really does it for me. I highly recommend. A top 25 kung fu film in my book, and a staple of the genre.",1323820800,,1450,4.242753623188406
7955113,5,B00005UQ75,"When 3 kung fu masters show up in town and start causing trouble, one man takes it upon himself to do something about.  He despises their reckless use of the Martial arts and has no problem taking all three of them on, but is tricked by a supposed innocent bystander.  After being critically injured, he manages to barely escape with his life and is found and saved by a student at another kung fu school.  Appreciating the life saving actions of the student, he decides to take him on as his pupil and teach him how to defend himself.  But the pupils skills are put to the test as he must soon avenge his teacher untimely death at the hands of the three evil masters.  Solid martial arts action and a few laughs along the way!!",1300147200,,728,4.323529411764706
7955114,3,B00005UQ75,"I have no problems with the price or the time of arrival for my DVD. It was very reasonable. But for some reason, there is a few seconds of black out in the movie during the scene where one of the three evils is at a brothel throwing gold at the prostitutes. This didn't stop me from keeping the disc because it's the movie editor's fault, but this is a little something I thought a fan of the movie should know about. Other than this, I love this DVD!",1214956800,,452,4.089887640449438
7955115,3,B00005UQ75,"We found this movie in the mid 80's and tried to video tape it, but we couldn't get it all. A martial artist, who has an unusual style is attacked by three men who also have powerful techniques. The injured man is found by a goofy student who takes care of him. In return, the injured man teaches the student his special techniques and gives him pointers on how to defeat the 3 Evil Masters who have taken over the town. The dialogue and the acting are so stupid that it's incredibly funny. What held our attention is the fighting. Some of the things these men do will blow you away! There is a little language and a little sexuality, so it's not for small children. My children are all adults now, but they still quote this movie and it still makes us laugh. I've always wanted to find an original copy because we love it so!",1184457600,,826,4.267515923566879
7955116,5,B00005UQ75,"Listen up all old school Kung Fu fans do not sleep on this one. This is surely in my top 5% of great all time Kung Fu flicks.  Years ago, this was one of the flicks (on VHS then) that was least advertised and spoken about in my neighborhood.  I just happen to pick it up at my local video rental store because the cover looked interesting.  Man, I picked a winner with this one!

This flick is the classic case of a young, skinny, and unskilled student getting picked on and bullied by others - in my opinion - less skillful than himself. Because he was less in stature and position and was the Kung Fu school's flunkee, he was often used as a punching bag - even by his teacher who was supposed to teach him Kung Fu and protect him.

After finding an extremely injured man who managed to escape the clutches of ""The Three Evils"", he took it upon himself to hide him on the premises and try to nurse him back to health.  His fellow students nor his teacher never knew that he was hiding a severely injured man.  He later learned that it was this same man that broke his teacher's ribs in a fight.  So, Yes, his new friend and teacher had history and an obvious hatred for one another. This fact was played into the plot and carried out well here. Out of pure gratitude for what this young student done for him, this teacher taught him Kung Fu to prevent him from being further bullied.

Once his teacher discovered he had befriended the same man who broke his ribs, he was viewed as a traitor and forced to leave the Kung Fu school.  After ""The Three Evils"" caught up with his friend (who was still injured) and killed him they took over his teacher's school.  They forced the teacher to obey their demands and made servants of the students.

After using trickery to gain access into the school as a student again, he began to scheme and plan his revenge against ""The Three Evils"" for killing his friend and taking over his teacher's school.

I purposely left out many details as to not give away too much of the plot and the excellent ending.  It's an ending that can easily go down as being one of the best in Kung Fu.

The Kung Fu in this movie is excellent.  This guy has a roundhouse kick you won't believe - whoaaaaaa - it's something you must see for yourself!!!!!!  This young student is awesome - totally awesome!  It's a shame that I don't see this guy in too many other Kung Fu flicks. The ""back"" button will be your bestfriend in this one.  I can't tell you how many times I had to go back to see a special move saying to myself, ""Man, no way, he didn't just do that!""  The overdubs on the DVD great - acting - no problem! I was sold. I'm truly impressed with the quality of this old school joint.

I gave this movie a ""5"" star rating based upon the movie itself not the dubbing of it to DVD.  This was a great flick in itself from beginning to end.  This is a must have for your Kung Fu collection.",1125273600,3,2911,4.205405405405405

7955118,4,B00005UQ75,"""It's just you should be punished.  I'm going to chop off your arms, so are you ready?  Those word are spoken by Chen Kuan-tai as Chin as so begins probaly the best opening fight sequence in a Shaw Brother movie.  Chin takes on all three of the titled villains in a restaurant.  Watch closely as the knife expert does a back flip while throwing two knives.  The Three Evils are lead by my favorite Shaw actor Wang Lung-wei. You would reconize him as Iron Robe in Kid With the Golden Arm and also from Five Deadly Venoms.  In this movie he uses Panther style.  In the movie the Three Evils wound Chin and he hides in a Kung-fu school where he is aided by Kao-chin. Chin repays Kao-chin by teaching him new techniques.  I don't want to give away the whole movie, which I'm sure you enjoy.  All the good Shaw elements are here excellent martial arts and choreography and the hero gets his revenge.  I would like to explain why I gave this movie four stars.  Like I said I love this movie, but I took one star away because of the quality of the DVD.  I know the makers Ground Zero tried to the best they could by using the best original print they could find, but I can't give a perfect rating to am ovie that's neither wide screen nor remasterd.  Unfortuantely many reviewers are quick to slap on a perfect rating because the movie is great and forget the quality of the DVD it's self. I just want people to know what they are buying.  If you are a old school martial arts fan I encourage you to buy this because it's the best version of this good film at a reasonable price.  I can only hope that one day someone takes the Shaw films seriously and gives a digital remasters with all the extras.",1011398400,8,1692,4.260188087774295
