5944990,5,B00EV1YZRI,"My family are HUGE Disney movie fans. Whether they are cartoons or regular movies we are there. I have been a bit skeptical on some of the sequels in the past as some were not to the same caliber of writing or animation it seemed to me. However in saying this I have to relate that this was not the cast with these films. My girls loved both of these films. One of the things that I appreciated was having two films in one. This means less space and easier transport-ability in the long run as well. The movies had some great new songs and I appreciated that they used similar actors so that the voices would remain in tact for the characters that you know and love. There are also some great messages that parents want to share with their children in these movies that range from messages of friendship and dedication, to those of self-exploration and trusting in others as well as many others. All-in-all, this was a great Blu-ray and one that I would highly recommend to others!

*I received a copy of the Blu-ray for review - all opinions are my own*",1385769600,,1054,4.377551020408164
5944991,2,B00EV1YZRI,"This review originally appeared at:[...]

George: So, these other two films have just been released on blu-ray. Wait, are they serious?

Jeff: Thats some way to start the review, George. Its almost like the entirety of what were about to say can be summed up by that alone.

George: We both loved the blu-ray release of the Little Mermaid (read our review , here). I missed the release of the Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea and Little Mermaid: Ariels Beginning when they were released at some point in the past. Theres good reason for that. After seeing both films, I cant really recommend a viewing order. The Little Mermaid II takes place a few years after Little Mermaid while Ariels Beginnings is an obvious prequel. I will say that there was an obvious difference between the two films that was quite jarring.

Jeff: I guess we should start with The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. The basic plot is a reverse of the original film. Ariels daughter, Melody, is a human who wants to play all day in the ocean. But, due to Morgana (Ursulas crazy sister), who tries to kidnap the child when she is young, she is forbidden to go near it. Of course, disobeying her mothers wishes, Melody escapes to the sea, learns her mermaid heritage, and finds out why its hotter under the water. On paper, I love the concept. Is it a good film, though? Short answer: nope. I feel like they disrespect the original in a few ways, reducing Ariel to a supporting character role and almost changing her entire personality completely.

George: I was completely unnerved by Ariel and Prince Erics lack of parenting in this film. In order to save Melody from skinny Ursula, the build a fortress that destroys the look of the castle and forbid Melody from seeing her grandfather, the Sea King. What? And they never tell Melody that her mom was a Mermaid when most everyone in the castle saw the transformation at the end of the first film? Ok. Well, the animation was truly subpar, even compared to the animated show and the music was incredibly lacking. And what happened to Prince Erics voice?

Jeff: The only upside (as small as it may be) is that Jodi Benson returns to voice Ariel. But again, her role in this is so small that it didn't really matter all that much. I will give some extra points for the transfer, as its not terrible, but its not the best, either. Its truly run of the mill, typical direct to video, and they don't usually look all that good in high definition.

George: The second film in the set, which is a prequel, so its the first film of the trilogywait, my head hurtswas actually a tremendous surprise. Ariels Beginning is about, well, the beginning. We find King Triton, his wife and their mer-brood enjoying life in the royal court. Tragedy strikes and we understand why theres no Queen Triton in the Little Mermaid. Basically, music is outlawed under the sea and Ariel has to find her voice and bring love back to the kingdom. At least this film kept my attention and seemed miles above (fathoms below?) the Little Mermaid II and many of the other direct-to-video sequels.

Jeff: I did enjoy this film marginally more than the sequel, but at the end of the day, its still a subpar and unnecessary look into a story we didn't really need. Sure, it was neat to see how things came to be in the original film, but it still was missing a lot of the charm that the original had.

George: Thats true and its really hard to recommend a blu-ray purchase when only part of the it is decent (and thats being generous). This is squarely aimed at diehard Little Mermaid fans. I know that Disney only releases a few major films each year, but there are still plenty of films that haven't been on DVD that deserve more attention than these two films.

Jeff: There are a handful of new extras on the disc that pertain to both films. There is a story, read by Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel, a deleted song, some deleted scenes, some sing alongs, and not much else. Nothing really should compel you to purchase the disc, though, as they are just like the films themselves: sub par and kind of disappointing.

George: So, another subpar release from Disney? Unless you're a Little Mermaid fanatic, theres no reason to pick these up. Youre much better off purchasing the blu-ray release of the Little Mermaid from earlier in the year. Or just watching Communicore Weekly over and over and over",1385337600,8,4398,4.547408343868521
5944992,3,B00EV1YZRI,"My daughter loves the Little Mermaid and we bought the new blu ray/digital copy immediately.  I don't understand why in this era a digital copy isn't standard on any blu ray purchase.  Honestly I have zero use for the standard DVD version and if people still want a standard version, fine sell that as stand alone but please include a digital version so I can load it on my ipad for use when traveling.

I can't speak to the quality of this movie, only just the frustration of seeing no digital copy included.",1383091200,5,509,4.451612903225806
5944993,4,B00EV1YZRI,"Alright we have watched the Little Mermaid and were treated to an event in the Little Mermaid 2 Return to the Sea to meet Ariel's daughter Melody , and than we are taken to the past to see a glimps of Ariel's childhood and even see her mother for a few brief minutes before tragedy falls .

The films do an alright job fitting along side of their crowning jewel .

The only downer in this franchise is that there are many deleted scenes and bonus features that could make these editions worth while but the damn company won't give a good fully loaded copy  of the prequel and sequel .  With BluRay you would think they would unload a whole grotto of features onto the disc....

Take as an example,  The Lion King 2 has a nice bit of deleted scenes,  however there has never been a release of the deleted scenes in the USA .

It is a shame when a great edition could make for better sales

The films are nothing much when compared to the masterpiece / classic film The Little Mermaid",1379289600,40,982,4.236559139784946
5944994,4,B00EV1YZRI,"I really think that Disney is doing a great job brining back these movies onto blu ray movies, 2 movies not so bad and you get points for it so that is great.
I am not a huge fan of movies the continue but if you have ever watched the Little Mermaid then no harm in looking at 2,3,
So if you like disney movies i would say get these movies not bad.
Look around for a great price and when it comes out look for a good price at stores some of them do not sell them on sale, i asked about this and it all depends on what Disney says
Well good luck to all who get this",1379116800,6,564,3.7083333333333335

5945233,4,B00EV1YZRI,"My 3 year old is OBSESSED with The Little Mermaid, so I thought she'd love this set too.  She really likes both of the movies.  Ariel's Beginning is a pre-qual to the original and has the same great characters, along with some new ones.  The Little Mermaid II is about Ariel's mermaid daughter and introduces lots of new, fun characters. Like most straight to DVD films, the songs aren't as great and the voice acting is not as well done for all of the characters, but for my Little Mermaid lover, it's still very good!",1421798400,8,519,4.442105263157894

5945259,4,B00EV1YZRI,"These are fun DVDs, and my daughter loves them. The Little Mermaid II is clearly very cheaply made with not only character voices different but less experienced character artists different b/c they weren't good at all, especially noticeable was Flounder. In any case, my daughter did not notice or care. Arial's Beginning was much better quality and the story of where it all started and what happened to her mom are answered and this one is of better quality.",1421193600,,460,4.8354430379746836

It is a personal preference but this DVD was not a hit in our household.  Also, the actual disk won't play very well either. The DVD player keeps ejecting it as ""bad disk"", although it has only been a week and the DVD player plays other disks just fine.

I have to say I wasn't in love with the Little Mermaid II but it was much better than the second Cinderella. All in all for 2 movies this is a good value and we do watch them both. Regularly.

5945380,5,B00EV1YZRI,"it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it",1390348800,,104,4.0
5945381,4,B00EV1YZRI,The movies were great. my daughter loves them. the only thing i had a problem with is that they stacked the dvds on top of the other. most blu-rays come with 3 to 4 discs and each have their own slot. well this blu-ray comes with 3 discs and two slots so two of the discs are stacked and share the same spot. I did not like that and would have definitely given this product 5 stars had it been like the other blu-rays I've bought.,1390003200,,430,4.011627906976744

5945395,5,B00EV1YZRI,I had the first movie on VHS that my daughter loved and kept it so when I became a grandmother I had shown it to my granddaughter and Ariel is her favorite princess at the age of 10 and wanted to add to our collection and didn't have it on a DVD I think she watches it at least once a day,1389225600,2,288,3.661290322580645

5945410,4,B00EV1YZRI,"After a theatrical rollout of the digitally remastered ""The Little Mermaid"" in high-definition 3D, Disney did what we've come to expect from them. They released its two direct-to-video sequels, ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" and ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea,"" in one Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack. The follow-ups might not be as good as the original, but you better believe there's a demand for them.

In the prequel ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning,"" King Triton (Jim Cummings) bans all music from the kingdom of Atlantica. After visiting a secret underground club, his youngest daughter Ariel's (Jodi Benson) passion for music is ignited. Does the mermaid hide her love of music from her father or reveal it to him? She embarks on a dangerous journey to convince her father to allow music in his kingdom once more.

""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" begins with Ariel and Eric (Rob Paulsen) celebrating the birth of their daughter, Melody (Tara Strong). Melody is curious about her heritage as a mermaid and journeys into the sea to become a mermaid. Ursala's evil daughter Morgana (Pat Carroll) involves Melody in her plot to take over the underwater world. Ariel finds herself reuniting with Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright), Flounder (Cam Clarke), and Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) in a dangerous adventure to save her daughter and restore peace to the Seven Seas.

Both movies have been given high-definition video and audio upgrades. The 1080p transfers are clean and vibrant, making the colors simply pop out at the viewer. A 5.1 surround sound mix immerses audiences in the underwater world of Ariel and her friends. It also brightens the wonderful musical numbers and will leave your ears delighted.

""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" and ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" each have fun bonus material. They include a Storybook read by Jodi Benson, a deleted song and two deleted scenes, four sing-along songs, and a Mermaid Discovery Vanity Game. A classic animated short entitled ""Merbabies"" is featured as well.

""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" and ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" 3-Disc Special Edition will thrill all fans of Disney Princesses. There's nothing here that will top the first movie. However, both will give viewers something else to watch when their children either grow tired of the original or wear out their existing copy.",1386547200,3,2408,5.11704834605598
5945411,5,B00EV1YZRI,"This is a great Blu-Ray/DVD Combo because you get not only both discs but you get two whole movies, a prequel and a sequel to The Little Mermaid!  Ariel's Beginning is all about her childhood and even shows us what happens to her mother (yes she does die) that has made her father so protective.  I had honestly never thought about Disney not explaining that in The Little Mermaid.  Now it makes more sense!  Then you get Return to the Sea which is all about Ariel's daughter!  Yeah that makes me old thinking Ariel has a daughter (yes I know its a cartoon movie!)  How is the animation?  It is actually great.  Sometimes when prequels or sequels are made the animation is terrible but that is not the case for this disc set.  I was impressed with the high definition quality and sound, yes being a Blu-Ray does help as well.  These are two Disney movies that I honestly didn't even know existed and I am so excited to own to watch with my own daughter.  I see a Little Mermaid marathon in our future!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1386460800,,1075,4.373737373737374

But, she later on dreams of being in the ocean or the sea, and goes to venture out for herself and Ursula's sister comes to her aide and transforms her into a mermaid. (Eric and Ariel's daughter is Melody) The witch tricks Melody into stealing King Triton's triton, and Ariel turns back into a mermaid to go save her daughter, and together they save Atlantica from Ursula's sister. And in the end, Melody is allowed to be with her family on land, and lived happily ever after but they no longer protect her from the sea.",1386460800,,667,4.475409836065574
