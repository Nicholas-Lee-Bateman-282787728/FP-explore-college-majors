6505225,5,B00LTO33Q4,"I too, can rewatch these every now and then as a refreshing, and relaxing change from the extremes we get these days on TV.
Some other appealing points, probably also noticed by others, is how good Angela Lansbury is at being Jessica at home or on the case
and well spoken.  I don't think anyone else could have done better (Although, if it had been Doris Day, we would probably just have gotten use to a different type of J.B.F.). Than, there's the music, which is well done and seems original to every episode, not recycled (Credits show different writers); almost movie quality, especially when used with some good cinematography of the opening scenes that introduce the story and other places.",1411948800,,697,4.760330578512397
6505246,5,B00LTO33Q4,We have been re-watching this entire series and enjoying it so much just as we did in earlier years.  Great relaxation viewing with suspense and fairly predictable outcome.  Angela Lansbury is always so much fun to watch.,1486339200,,221,4.945945945945946

6505285,5,B00LTO33Q4,"This is really one of my all time favorite shows. When I was a child I watched murder she wrote with my Nana every week who was an avid mystery novel fan and I came to love the show as a bonding experience with her. As an adult I've now rewatched the series and really love it, not just for the memories of the woman I loved but for the show itself. The innocence and quality of the show is something we'll never see again in this day and age but its still timeless. If you love mysteries and don't require close up shots of corpses and half naked strippers and serial killers to be enertained then you'll love this show as well.",1449619200,5,629,4.121951219512195

8668001,5,B00LTO33Q4,"This is the last season of Murder, She Wrote.  CBS purposely ended the series by switching its timeslot and night.  The show plummeted from eighth to fifty-eighth in the ratings, forcing CBS to cancel the show due to poor ratings.  It was sad to see it end, forced out because of a bad decision on the part of CBS management.
Other than that, the show was a good as ever.",1507852800,,371,4.271428571428571
