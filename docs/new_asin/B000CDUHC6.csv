8097981,5,B000CDUHC6,"I enjoy Esteban's lessons and DVDs. I love the guitar, it is a wonderful and beautiful instrument that brings joy to everyone, and Esteban is living proof of that. In this DVD, Esteban teaches you how to hold the guitar correctly, how to position your hands, how to tune the guitar, as well as some training exercises like the chromatic scale. I had this DVD along with the other 5+ dvds in the same series in another house but lost them all and I found out recently that amazon had a few different Esteban lesson dvd series and I found this series again and ordered volume 1 earlier this year. I need to get the rest to my collection. If you want a great person and teacher for the guitar, then this guy is a fine example. I know there are other teachers out there with their own dvds but Esteban's dvds started my interest in the guitar. Wonderful guy, teacher and excellent skilled guitar player. Def. 5 stars from me.",1469232000,2,921,4.391812865497076
