8497315,1,B0000DG98Y,I can only express my true sentiments with one word - JUNK!  I know different horses for different courses but this is mindless garbage. The music CD is bargain bin type stuff of which some is mildly listen able however the DVD is so weird that even if you were tripping on acid I don't think the videos would inspire any startling revelations.  Don't waste your money on this rubbish.,1186704000,,385,4.485714285714286
8497316,5,B0000DG98Y,"Probably to weird to understand, but then again, you never understood ANYTHING. Cosmic toxic stew anthology of several short tales from the nasty corner of a cinematic dumpster. Character-driven, takes parts from sci-fi, sexual mind benders, 80's teen movies, spy thrillers, bad horror movies, disgusting snuff flicks, urban decay intropsections, heavy metal videos, porn, and the bastard child of David Lynch does John Watters fluffed by Fellini and Troma. Comes with the soundtrack also.  Includes the Doormouse (Addict Records) ""Skelechairs"" video which is a cinematic delight in its own right and deserves the price alone.",1067472000,4,626,5.589473684210526
