8223980,4,B000WM4R7S,It's a very good TV movie with a lot of great names in the roles.  I have the disc from Wild Eye and wish they had really gotten a better print of this film.  Especially at the beginning there is some color flashing and later at one of the breaks there is a bit of splicey dialogue.  Would like to see more of these older TV movies released.,1452384000,,341,3.985294117647059
8223981,5,B000WM4R7S,"THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER (1973) is yet one more excellent made-for-TV-movie dealing w/ an occult / satanic story-line. This time, Beelzebub is up to his old, fiendish tricks again, fathering a child w/ a human woman named Alice Shaw (Diane Ladd- EMBRYO, WILD AT HEART, INLAND EMPIRE). Years later, the hell-spawn, named Diane Shaw (Belinda J. Montgomery), is all grown up. She finds herself in the care of her dear Aunt Lilith (Shelly Winters- THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, LOLITA, WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?, CLEOPATRA JONES, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE) and her strange, mute chauffeur, Mr. Howard (Jonathon Frid- TV's DARK SHADOWS, SEIZURE), seemingly unaware of her malevolent parentage. Soon, Lilith, along w/ her creepy friends, crowd in on Diane, who is slow to interpret the demonic goings-on. Not even the huge portrait of Satan in Lilith's living room can penetrate Diane's naive persona. It's only when she begins having devilish nightmares, and is stalked by hellish minions, that Diane starts to wonder about things. As 70's devil movies go, TDD is a superior entry, w/ Ms. Winters providing more than her share of brilliant, scenery-devouring antics. Frid is also quite good in his silent role. Watch for Abe Vigoda (THE GODFATHER, JOE VS. THE VOLCANO), Joseph Cotten (LADY FRANKENSTEIN), Ian Wolfe (THE SENTINEL), and Robert Foxworth (THE ASTRAL FACTOR, DAMIEN: OMEN 2, THE PROPHECY) in small, but perfectly eeevil roles. Highly recommended for fans of these ominous, entertaining films...",1434326400,4,1488,5.256302521008403
8223982,5,B000WM4R7S,"When I was only about 5 or so I remember waiting all week for the ABC Movies of the week. This is one that I remember best during those early years. I would get bathed & my pj's on extra early so that my parents & I could all watch together, and even though some of the content was a little hard to understand I still got the gist of what was going on. Kids now just don't understand how a TV movie could be that good that we waited eagerly every week for a new movie but how can I remember something @ that young age.
I try to explain that not only was the story & plot well written but there were big name celebrities, no cheesy scenes, costumes, or acting.
I was lucky to see some clips on YouTube. I finally find copies but they're selling @ outrageous prices. I mean come on starting @ $46?! WOW, I don't remember it being that good.",1393200000,,838,4.023952095808383
8223983,5,B000WM4R7S,"We saw this on tv originally when I was in high school. Let's just say, not only was the ending surprising and unsettling, but our Church calendar fell off the wall as the credits rolled! That really freaked out my Mom. I'd been searching for this for years - so glad I finally found it.",1368576000,,287,4.236363636363636
8223984,5,B000WM4R7S,"I love this movie and want it so badly on dvd.  Why so much?  I have academy award winning movies on dvd go for much less.  Given that many are struggling to make ends meet, the movie is great; the price, ridiculous.",1359244800,,216,4.095238095238095
8223985,5,B000WM4R7S,"An aspiring mother makes a pact with The Devil for wealth in exchange for her daughter, who would one day marry Satan's son. She despicably tries to renege on the deal, and is promptly punished for her ingratitude. In an attempt to shoot The Devil, the bullet actually penetrates her own chest. Her daughter 'Diane' {Belinda Montgomery} grows up sheltered in convents and private schools, eventually developing into quite a comely young lady until the day of her mother's funeral, where she meets with Lilith Malone {Shelley Winters}, who graciously offers her to stay at her beautiful home, wherein she begins experiencing nightmares and comes upon little secrets here and there, and her suspicion grows. She becomes fascinated by a certain sigil which she notices being virtually omnipresent at the mansion, on objects, and on jewelry upon suspicious persons, including two rather feather-brained women who act like something out of The Stepford Wives.

Upon meeting a new friend Alice Shaw {Diane Ladd}, she decides to be out on her own, and leaves the comfort of this veritable palace for an apartment. Here and there, Lilith and her cohorts begin appearing, monitoring her. Jonathan Frid {of Barnabas Collins / 'Dark Shadows' fame} plays a mute butler / limousine driver, who seems to feel for the young lady's perceived plight, when all she had to do all along is merely accept her birthright as the ""Princess of Darkness'.

One night while at a party thrown by Lilith, Diane drinks a bit too much wherein her repressed carnal expression breaks free and begins lasciviously dancing in the midst of the crowd, who begin hailing her as the said 'Princess of Darkness', as well as 'The Demon of Endor'. Her denial persists, despite her increasing experiences with her own diabolical powers made manifest. She is summoned by a Judge who informs her that her father set up a trust fund for her; who pleasantly agrees to 'give her away' at her impending whirlwind romance and wedding. I thought it rather interesting that she began dating her now dead friend's man, who perished in a freak horse 'accident' {seems that during one of Lilith's unexpected visits, she stealthily lifted a horse figurine from Alice's collection, obviously using it for a Curse}. She meets Steve Stone {Robert Foxworth} and falls horns over hoofs in love. We later come to discover that she meets her true ""soul-mate"" in his form.

Many surprises await the viewer at the end during The Wedding with a truly delightful twist.

The Devil's Daughter was released around the same time as all the legendary 'devil movies' such as The Devil's Rain, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and later, The Omen were, which also includes an 'all-star' cast, and otherwise served to launch the career of subsequent stars.

8223986,5,B000WM4R7S,I was 7-8yrs old when this movie aired on a Tuesday night(movie of the week)my brothers and i begged and pleaded with our mom to watch this movie(it was a bet in school who would watch this movie)needless to say my parents regretted this decision because they couldn't keep us out of their room for two weeks. After i ordered this movie i called my oldest brother to remind him of our ordeal and we laughed about how the Demon of Endor was under our beds waiting for us. If you have a passion for movies like this get it.,1246320000,6,521,4.22
8223987,3,B000WM4R7S,"I really liked this movie, no gore just lots of eerie atmosphiric tension throughout. But Jonathan Frid deserved a role that had some lines! And not just as a mute Chauffer/Boy toy for Miss Shelley Winters. I mean, he carried Dark Shadows for 4 years and was always so great at compassionately killing off people. But Shelley Winters is fun to watch as Lilith, in my opinion. And Joseph Cotton is always good in anything with a horror/suspence element.",1217116800,6,452,4.734177215189874
8223988,5,B000WM4R7S,I haven't seen this made for tv movie since its original release. The dvd has not been remaster or color restored but the transfer certainly is a good quality. The storyline is fast moving and the actors top notch. I would recommend the dvd to anyone that enjoys made for tv movies. Add this title to your collection. You will not be disappointed.,1204761600,11,347,4.523809523809524
