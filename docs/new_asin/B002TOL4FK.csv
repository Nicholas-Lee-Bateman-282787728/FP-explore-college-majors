8380538,5,B002TOL4FK,"I had the opportunity to view The Italian Zombie Movie over 2 nights at the Cinema Wasteland horror/B-movie convention recently. This film, although clearly made on a shoestring budget, is clearly a labor of love.....a love of the zombie movies from Italian directors, particularly the great Lucio Fulci. It combines elements from these films with some sci-fi, a good dose of blood & gore, a halfway-coherent plotline with a few twists to create a very enjoyable zombie comedy. Any fan of Italian-directed zombie movies, or just zombie movies in general, will enjoy this little indie scare-comedy. I purchased the 2 parts separately, so this review is on both pages. ENJOY!!!! (I know I did!!!) Buy this film so this filmmaker can continue providing us with great low-budget fun!!",1272585600,2,780,5.1015625
8380539,5,B002TOL4FK,"WoW!!! Someone in the horror/comedy genre got the hint!! & it's about time. The Italian Zombie Movie is a breath of fresh air in the indie film industry, Dir. Tom Berdinski did not set out to make a ""be all end all"" zombie movie, but what he did do was make a smart, entertaining film in a catagory of films that is almost as dead as the corpses that shamble on the screen in so many low budget films. Berdinski makes it easy for the viewer to follow his outing with chapters like ""night of the zombies"" which really works with the film. As a big fan of zombie movies I can't tell you how many films I have sat through wondering ""where is this going and when does it end?"" Such is not the case for IZM pt one. first of all, i'm not a big fan of CGI effects. Berdinski uses none of that. the FX are glorious & gory (see nail into eyeball in the first 10 min.)the film itself is like a rollercoaster ride that starts off slow but then builds as you reach the top & are then plunged in a heap of intestines & violence! Berdinski is not trying to make a serios zombie film but he is making a point. Classic special effects are alive & well on the indie scene still! if you are looking for a serious low budget film, look elsewhere,BUT if you want to be entertained with a funny, & witty film & a overall good time with creative kills & lots of gore IZM is waiting for you like human prey to a hungry pack of the undead! no stop reading & by all means Horror fans unite! BUY The Italian Zombie Movie!!

8380540,5,B002TOL4FK,"You have to love actors that don't take themselves too seriously and you really have to love zombies who  . . . whoa almost gave away too much information!  This is a classic zombie movie.  A little grossness, some humor, and a lot of undead.  If you are a fan of zombies, don't miss this movie or its sequel.",1268265600,2,309,4.186440677966102
8380541,5,B002TOL4FK,"On a shoestring budget, Tom Berdinski and his troop of local actors, created a fun to watch, parody of 70's schlock monster movies. Some of the lines are priceless, if not familiar. If you are a true fan of B monster movies, and TV shows of the 70's, you will find those gems of dialog, that you can't help but laugh out loud at. Most of the actors are fun to watch and create a great chemistry of comedy timing and goofy-ness.  If you've ever thought about making you own movie, with a bunch of friends, this is what it would turn out like. A lot of fun!",1264896000,2,555,4.138888888888889
8380542,4,B002TOL4FK,"This is a good movie that is funny in a way like scary movie.  The low budget makes the movie even more humorous.  The acting, camera work, and special effects are good. The plot is a little lame, but after all, this is an italian zombie movie! This is an entertaining movie that is worth the cost.",1262649600,3,298,4.2105263157894735
8380543,4,B002TOL4FK,"THE ITALIAN ZOMBIE MOVIE PARTS 1 and 2

For having the budget of a what semi decent used car would sell for the two full length films: Zombie Movie part 1(Zombie Abomination) and part 2 (Zombie Atrocity) have a striking snares of dark humor coagulated in honor of true cinema independence. The zombies not only look amazing but the lighting could be almost straight from Lucio Fulci's ""The Gates of Hell"" or yet Bruno Mattei's film ""Burial ground"".

Just the way zombies arise and devour pays it's respects to the Italian masters. The score itself surrenders completely to the feel of a true 80's Italian Horror Film. Almost every detail the tongue and cheek humor delivers endless silly gore amongst the cast that really cares and gets behind the dialogue. Zombie Atrocity and Zombie Abomination are truly a unique crafted parody/homage to the yesteryear of Italian zombie films. I cannot wait to see the next project from The Cult of Moi and Vous films will be! Grazie!",1262131200,3,971,4.808383233532934
8380544,5,B002TOL4FK,"As a fan of 80's ""B"" movies, I have to say this is one of the best to come along in twenty years!  It's funny, gory, sexy and smart.  A zero budget film with great special effects and a cast and crew that loved what they were creating.  Grab a group of friends and a couple of Ichabod's and enjoy this Wildly acclaimed film festival favorite!",1261958400,3,342,4.151515151515151
8380545,5,B002TOL4FK,"This is a GREAT movie to pop in alone, but even better to watch with friends. This movie is more entertaining than alot of the crap Hollywood is shoveling out these days. Even better that its part 1 of a 2 part series, so even MORE fun can be had in Part 2.
 The bttom line is this, you WILL have a great time watching this, and an even BETTER time re-watching it. support Independent Movie Makers and support great ideas, and grab a great dvd in the process!",1259625600,4,459,4.157303370786517
8380546,5,B002TOL4FK,"I really enjoyed this movie, and its sequel Zombie Atrocity. It's fun, it's smart, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. This is what I love about independent filmmaking -- Thomas Berdinski and the wonderful cast and crew he assembled are truly passionate about what they're doing, and have fun doing it. Watching these movies, you'll feel the passion and fun that the makers have.

A perfect movie? No. Low budget? Yep. But a hell of lot of fun.",1256774400,5,450,4.69620253164557
