1546705,5,B00005JOLS,"...since KING-5 has stated they refuse to ever release Almost Live! onto DVD.  The dot com yuppies homogenized the Pacific NW neighborhoods to the extent that Almost Live! stands as a timeless snapshot of what once made the area so vibrant.

I truly hope the idiots at KING will wake up and change their minds.  Almost Live! was too important to the NW.",1205193600,5,353,4.571428571428571
1546706,5,B00005JOLS,"I grew up watching Almost Live! every weekend--as a native Seattleite, I caught all the little quirky Northwest gags people in other parts of the country probably wouldn't. It's a hilarious show no matter where you're from, but it's especially great for those of us who live in Western Washington--Lynnwood Beauty Academy, anyone? I still can't believe King 5 hasn't released this on DVD, since it would be a huge money-maker thanks to all of us still-devoted fans.",1203811200,2,465,4.9743589743589745
1546707,5,B00005JOLS,"...so I visited the Wiki page, and then I came here.  I only caught the expurgated versions of the show on Comedy Central but damn, was it funny!  Utterly brilliant stuff!  The worst episode of ""Almost Live!"" was funnier than the best episodes of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Mad TV"" from the same era (and, particularly with the chronically overrated SNL, almost any era).

Please, whoever owns the rights--release the DVDs!  So what if the material's probably a little dated by now.  There are lots of people--including people like me, who have never been within a thousand miles of Seattle--would would love to see this show again.",1203552000,12,632,4.859813084112149
1546708,5,B00005JOLS,"What a show. To date I can not recall many of the episodes. I can however, recall Pat Cashman sniffing a line of coke for the very last episode. Good times, good times!

On occasion I am treated with a rerun of the show and get to enjoy the consistent and ever so hilarious bashing of Kent, Wa. Poooooor Kent... I hope some day we get the opportunity to purchase this on DVD but, I just don't see that happening.

What ever happened to Pat Cashman and Bill Nye!?! I rarely see TV commercials any more.",1195084800,2,501,4.208333333333333
1546709,5,B00005JOLS,"First Off, This Show is GREAT and one of my all time favorites !!!
I was able to obtain a Program Guide for the entire series of Almost Live! and it looks like they filmed 257 total shows over a 10 year period.
I have managed to get about 246 of those shows recorded to DVD with the Commercials edited out.
I am currently recording the shows two back to back appearances once a week on Seattle's KING TV. I'm just looking for one of the 11 shows I'm missing. Anyway the Quest goes on since I really don't think these shows will ever be released to DVD or any future media. I have several postings at different Forums that discuss this issue. I have also created  hand written notes that list every skit in my collection. If you have any questions on what I have so far recorded or about a certain skit, please look for these other forum postings. Good Luck & Good Hunting",1193443200,2,871,4.246987951807229
1546710,5,B00005JOLS,"Seriously, why would a show as popular, witty, and memorable as this NOT already be on DVD?  At the very LEAST there should already be a ""best of"" DVD, but heck I'd buy every single season if they released them.  So the jokes are dated, and it's true that the only ones to really ""hit it big"" outside of Seattle were Bill Nye (of The Science Guy) and Joel McHale (of E! Talk Soup).  But I'd still laugh at every dated Seattle joke, treasure every moment of Billy Kwan, and drink in the guest celebrities like Michael Jordan and Dave Grohl.  What's not to like?  BRING IT OUT ON DVD ALREADY!  Criminey...",1187049600,2,603,4.339285714285714
1546711,5,B00005JOLS,"I would not be who I am today if it were not for this show. My family and I, mostly just me and my dad really, watched this show for years. It started on King 5 in the mid 80's and sadly ended it's run in the very end of the 90's. So for fifteen years out of my first twenty years I was educated with such jokes about Longacres and south King County and King Dogs. Speedwalker anyone? I am one for sure that wants to see this show on DVD. Bring it on!",1159401600,15,451,3.7578947368421054
1546712,5,B00005JOLS,"Almost Live! is a hilarious sketch comedy show based in Seattle Washignton and makes fun of all the people placesand things that go on there. Mainly, this programs ran from the late 80's to the early 90's until it was cancelled, but it did have a lot funny sketches. High Five'n White Guys, The News Report, and of course Billy Quan. This show was also the staring point for Bill Nye and his science show. It also features many other funny actors and actresses, so laugh until you die at this show!",1155168000,4,498,4.423913043478261
7941261,1,B00005JOLS,"If all these people are posting up begging for a DVD release,  doesn't it seem worth releasing? Five stars for the show, one star for a missed opportunity by the owners of the tapes.",1491264000,,182,4.352941176470588
7941262,5,B00005JOLS,Why do we have to post reviews for something we WISH existed?  Get this thing out here!,1433894400,,87,4.117647058823529
7941263,5,B00005JOLS,"Having grown up near Seattle, I was a loyal viewer of Almost Live!  I was devastated when it got cancelled and Ive been looking for a full-series DVD release ever since then.  I check back every so often to see if anything has been released and Im always disappointed when it hasn't been.  KING 5, PLEASE RELEASE THIS SHOW ON DVD!

In my opinion, Almost Live! is one of the funniest skit shows ever made.  I found myself consistently enjoying it more than Saturday Night Live.  Almost Live! was to Seattle what Portlandia is to Portland.

Without Almost Live!, we might not have Bill Nye the Science Guy, or Community.  Both Bill Nye and Joel McHale got their start on TV in this show.  Even back then, Bill Nye would have a weekly segment on Almost Live! in which he preformed awesome science experiments.

An Almost Live! DVD release would not only satisfy the original fan base like myself, it could potentially generate new fans.  Its that funny.

I look forward to the day when I can see all my favorite skits on DVD like: Worst Girlfriend in World, Speed Walker, Capable Woman,  Nature Walk with Chuck, The Lame List,  Ballard Driving Academy,  Uncle Fran's Musical Forest, Sluggy, The High-Fiven White Guys, and  Folk Songs of the Slightly Inebriated.

Please release the DVD so I can relive one of my all-time favorite TV shows and share it with my friends!",1390694400,,1365,4.620833333333334
7941264,5,B00005JOLS,"Please release the show to DVD!  I have the ""Best Of"" VHS tape, but do not want to buy a VCR just to watch it.  As the other folks mentioned, I would buy the entire set if released.  Great, great show.",1336521600,,201,3.8536585365853657
7941265,5,B00005JOLS,This is the funniest show ever. I want to relive the memories now that I'm a middle-management suck-up. Please!!!!!! We need Amazon.com to sell the DVD set of every single Almost Live episode ever aired!!!,1327363200,,205,4.885714285714286
7941266,5,B00005JOLS,We are sooooooo ready for this to come out on DVD. I'm from the Pacific Northwest and have faithfully watched this show from beginning to end. Give us what we want!,1309305600,3,164,4.32258064516129
7941267,5,B00005JOLS,"I must be getting older because I am becoming more nostalgic for the experiences of my youth. This show was one of my defining experiences. I regularly watched this show from about junior high until I was 18. The other day I found myself randomly thinking about ""The Worst Girlfriend"" in the world...and a flood of memories about this show came back: The High Fivin' White Guys, The Lame List (Patty Murray's Hair: ""Oh, LAME!! Unbelieveably LAME!!""), and all the other brilliant humor inspired by the Pacific Northwest. Of course, The Worst Girlfriend in the World (to a large, intimidating man: ""Hey, buddy! My boyfriend is gonna kick your ass!""). This show was the perfect opener to Saturday Night Live (back when SNL was funny and relevant) and often times, Almost Live overshadowed SNL. Imagine going to a U2 Concert and the opening band was infinitely better - yeah, ""Almost Live"" was that good.

I impulsively jumped on Amazon to purchase the full box set of ""Almost Live"" with credit card in hand...and was shocked to see that there is no such thing available. What a travesty. I would hope that the out of touch, bumbling exec that holds the rights to this show will one day achieve enlightenment and release it. But it probably won't happen until a ""Gen Xer"" gets into power and re-discovers it. I hope that day is not too far off.

I would give anything to see those goofy infomercials again for the latest music released by those folks singers. I just remember they were rolling all the song titles and I was hysterical with laughter. The one that stuck with me: ""I think I can beat this train.""",1306627200,3,1606,4.651408450704225
7941268,5,B00005JOLS,"A fantastically funny show, I wish I could view every episode as originally aired.  Once I learned about it back in the early 90's I never missed an episode.

I was only living in Washington for 3 years during the original airing of this show, but loved it.  I would immediately purchase a DVD set of the original versions of all seasons, preferably not the episodes edited for airing on Comedy Central.  To whomever owns the rights...PLEASE RELEASE A DVD SET!!!",1253059200,,462,4.666666666666667
7941269,5,B00005JOLS,"Many of us here in New Orleans during the early 90's were huge fans of Almost Live!  Almost Live! was one of earliest shows to air on Comedy Central, which was a new cable station at the time.  Almost Live! was also syndicated nationally, and it appeared locally in the early 2000's at 1:00 AM on Saturdays on WGNO (26).  I remember staying up to 1:00 AM every Saturday just to watch 30 minutes of Almost Live!

  Of course, the early 90's were the golden age of cable TV comedy.  Aside from Almost Live!, Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Monty Python were also on Comedy Central.  This was the Phil Hartman/Mike Meyers era of Saturday Night Live.  Greg Kinnear hosted Talk Soup on the E! Network.  And, there was a show on A&E every weekend called ""Evening at the Improv"", which featured the best and most original stand-up comedians of the time, some of whom are now famous actors and writers.

  It's a terrible shame that comedy has deteriorated so much since then.  Now all someone needs to do is make racist comments and say a lot profanities and they can get a show on XM radio.  I'd rather watch the episode of Almost Live! where John Keister was assaulted by a gang of dangerous ethnic stereotypes.  I think there was a Black man with an Afro and a boom box, a kungfu-fighting Asian, and a drunken Irishman...",1241395200,10,1318,4.474789915966387
7941270,5,B00005JOLS,"Almost Live! was a treasure maybe because it wasn't anything else like it on television unless you count Saturday Night Live or MAD TV. What made Almost Live! stand out from the rest was that the cast was excellent in it's portrayal of life in Seattle. A few years ago, I got to visit Seattle which is a beautiful, American city. Almost Live! was the best export from Seattle besides Starbucks. I used to tape it on after it aired on Saturday nights. I don't know why programming executives at the networks didn't bother to nationalize this show and put it in a decent time slot. Comedy Central has stopped showing episodes of the show years ago but they introduced Almost Live! to a national audience. We need laughter now more than ever and it's the best medicine. I remember some of the skits and wished to get the DVD to see some more. Like Mercer Island cops who bust somebody for drinking tap water instead of bottled water or maybe it was generic bottled water and not the expensive brand. The skit where summer comes for an afternoon. Whatever the cast did an excellent job and the show made me want to move to Seattle.",1240099200,3,1127,4.475728155339806
