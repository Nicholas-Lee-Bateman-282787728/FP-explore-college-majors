5773563,5,B00D49YDR0,"Darker than I imagined, but still gripping and always with a twist at the end.  Banks does a fine job of getting to the bottom of a murder/mystery, and letting the chips fall where they may.  His integrity is a thorn in the side of his bosses, but it gets him on top in the end.",1377993600,9,278,3.9464285714285716
5773564,5,B00D49YDR0,I hope that there will be more episodes to come because this is sort of like the Downton Abbey of crime shows!,1376524800,2,110,4.045454545454546
5773565,5,B00D49YDR0,Great deceive series. It was both tense and thought provoking .it was a series that I enjoyed a great deal.,1376524800,2,107,4.4
5773566,5,B00D49YDR0,"We enjoyed this series on PBS & wanted to see more. When I ordered it from Amazon, I failed to notice the warning that it was in a non-USA format. My DVD player would not play it. My laptop offered the option of changing its region setting, but warned this could only be changed 4 times during the life of the PC, so that didn't seem like a very satisfactory solution. When I initiated a return, Rare Consoles sent me a very accommodating e-mail, offering a full refund, & even a domestic address that would minimize my return shipping costs, but they also mentioned the option of obtaining a region-free DVD player for viewing DVD's not compatible with standard US players.  After reading up on region-free players offered on Amazon, I obtained one for under $40 (shipping included) that was a snap to set up & plays this DVD just fine.  Now I look forward to locating other seasons of this series, & also to using my new region-free DVD player for other non-USA format DVD's. Kudos to Rare Consoles for their customer service! --- Note: DCI Banks' new season-2 partner, DI Helen Morton, is played by Caroline Katz, who viewers may know from the Doc Martin series.  It's interesting to compare the characters she plays in these two very different series.",1370217600,46,1255,4.6441441441441444
5773567,5,B00D49YDR0,Great British detective series with Alan Banks teaming up with a new assistant.  I hope they continue to keep this series being filmed.,1370131200,2,135,4.869565217391305
5773568,5,B00D49YDR0,This second series is worth five stars plus!  DCI Banks 2 is another gritty BBC crime drama much like the Inspector Lewis series .  There are 3 more epesodes in this set with plot twists and surprises that will keep you guessing until the final minutes of each program .  DCI Allan Banks faces all kinds of challenges personally & on the job including dealing with his new recruit DI Helen Morton but he fights his way thru it all to close each difficult case.  I would only recomend this series to adult viewers due to it's mature content .,1363737600,29,541,4.38

5773575,5,B00D49YDR0,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

This show is really about the ""team"", and every one of the cast is unique and is top grade in terms of acting ability.

Finally, this show specializes is ""sick"" murders, but not in a way that creeps me out.",1486166400,,404,4.45945945945946

It is more gritty than 'Poirot' or 'Midsommer Murders' but I enjoyed it as much (better than the last couple of season for 'Midsommer Murders"" which may have ""jumped the shark"" as Motive did with its opening moments of the opening episode of season 3.

A note on the main character Alan Banks (Stephen Tompkinson):  He is well suited for the role and has a swagger that is out of this world.  I love him and the camaraderie created between him and the female investigators.  I also love his relationship with his father.

No two or three orher characters combined could match his centrality to the whole season and every episode.

The secondary lady detective in this season is an improvement over the one from season one , but again, for a female detective BLUE MURDER and VERA are better viewing.",1420156800,,458,4.506024096385542

No, she doesn't have a husband or boyfriend and as soon as the baby pops out she's eager to get back to work and be more fierce that ever. Oh well, that will give The Government something to do. Then a hooker is carrying a baby from who knows who whom she is going to sell to be parted out to save another kid with a weak heart. OK.

Unfortunately, the characters aren't very well formed (I'm half way through season 2, and can't really figure out what Banks' deal is, other than he's 'a quite nice policeman' (which hardly makes for a massively compelling lead), yet it's the plots which bring this show down; basically, they're not very good. Not enough suspects, hardly any 'twists', and you either guess within the first ten minutes 'whodunnit' (and if you don't, when the culprit is revealed, you don't really care).  Still, it's better than nothing.",1414886400,6,623,5.048543689320389

5774173,4,B00D49YDR0,"This second season of DCI Banks includes three stories on two discs, each of the stories consisting of two one-hour portions. Even more so than in season one, the photography, casting, and sense of brooding is simply excellent. I do have quibbles here and there. As at least one other reviewer declared, Banks is too emotional -- and in my opinion, suffers from occasional bad judgment -- to completely enthrall me. Minor character tics and flaws can be endearing, of course, but sometimes as I watched these episodes, I winced at what I thought were bad calls by Banks.

A good part of each story is really concerned with the private lives of one or more characters, which is a plus, except that at times I felt that intimate angle pushed the mystery itself out the window, leaving it almost like an afterthought. And more than once, there were loose plot threads or unexplained aspects that gnawed just a bit too much. Still, this series is so well-produced that one can overlook those negative personal reactions -- at least, I can. A fine series, made better by the replacement of Annie with Morton.",1412640000,,1103,4.715025906735751
5774194,5,B00D49YDR0,"As I post this review (in October 2014) there are already 18 reviews posted  including  three lengthy reviews of this DVD (dated 2013), though this release  from BBC Home Video  is due to be released on June 17, 2014. (I received an advance screener from the distributor.). This is because Amazon has a policy of combining all formats (streaming and physical product) together. So you should always note the date of the review.

Since there are two fairly in-depth reviews here, including one by my fellow Amazon Top 50 reviewer K. Harris, I won't go into much detail  though, honestly, I always feel that long reviews of mystery series give away too much info. Mysteries are called that because the less you know the better.  But Ill let you make that judgment call.
This volume contains three crime cases which are solved by DCI Alan Banks and his new partner Helen (there is a transition from his former partner,  Annie, at the beginning) Each case is covered in two 44 minute episodes. Note that even though the BBC name is on the package, the series was produced by the independent commercial ITV network, which is why there was plenty of room for commercials when it aired in the UK,

The series also aired in the US on some local PBS stations (more like a syndicated series) and I cant be certain if there was an edited version that was shown. (This happens with a lot of British shows that air on PBS in the US.). But I will warn you there is graphic language and violence  though the violence is toned down some from Season One. Yes, the cases are fascinating and will keep you guessing (in most cases) but viewers may want to know this.
The murders -each based on a novel by Peter Robinson - are central to each story. Banks (actor Stephen Tomlinson) is a serious man who lives alone and in Season One almost no time was spent on the personal lives (or background) of the recurring characters. But this time things get REALLY personal..

If you like British crime dramas, I can recommend DCI Banks; just be aware that the show is more violent than some others. And if you liked Season One, I think youll like this as well. I certainly did!

The set includes two DVDS. There are 4 episodes (2 cases, with 2 episodes each) on the first disc and the remaining case on the second disc. There are no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5774195,5,B00D49YDR0,"I enjoyed this series more than many of the American made dramas. Series is well written, all the actors work very well together, you become fully immersed in each show as well, which keeps your attention and guessing as to what will happen next. Stephen Tompkinson plays a strong leading character who keeps the others on their toes. His Team repays him with admiration and loyalty.

5774197,4,B00D49YDR0,"This is a great show. There are a lot of reasons to watch the show and if you're into British crime dramas you must watch it. There are two things, at least for me, that I didn't find helpful to the stories - but they are minor annoyances. First, it seemed almost every episode included a crime to be solved that was directly related to or involving one of the characters in the crime unit that was doing the investigation. I found it odd and unrealistic. Second, I loved DCI Banks character with one exception: He's too emotional for a British detective! I like my detectives more methodical, plodding and contemplative even. But that's just me. It would have been a 5 star otherwise.",1412121600,,685,4.532258064516129

5774203,4,B00D49YDR0,"You know, Leeds is far away from Ballykissangel, as the crow flies, and even further the Glen Afric Country Lodge, but Stephen Tompkinson manages the same indignant stare and compressed lip in Yorkshire as he did in South Africa (he was wild at heart at the time, so I suppose his demeanor was acceptable, and they do teach the fine art of the indignant stare in seminaries, do they not?). But the real star of this show is Caroline Catz, whose careful characterization of the uptight DI Helen Morton is as far away from DI Kate Ashurst (from Murder in Suburbia) or Louisa Glasson (from Doc Martin) as Portwenn is from Broederstroom.

And it's interesting that the breakout character in this series wasn't even in the Inspector Alan Banks novels by Peter Robinson. Sometimes fiction is stranger than, well, fiction.",1378080000,19,815,4.821428571428571
