8081736,1,B000B5XSJ4,"I loaned this video from the library prior to purchase and I have to support all of negative comments made about the instructor and the person doing the beginner moves.  The ""class"" takes place in a weird looking set and the poor beginner girl does not look like she has taken a pilates class in her life.  The intermediate girl looks like she has a clue.  The clothes are strange as well. I guess I'm spoiled by all the exercise videos with a coordinated look.  It was just a strange video.  I noted the flow of exercises as a routine and felt it was the most thought through thing about this video.  Needless to say I won't be buying this one.",1524873600,,645,4.289256198347108
8081737,5,B000B5XSJ4,I love this workout. The girl is annoying but I just mute her now that I know the moves. And the girl doing the level 1 modifications doesn't know what the heck she's doing. But this workout itself is easy for beginners with 3 levels of difficulty. I noticed toning and improved flexibility after just 2 weeks of doing the workout 3x a week.,1449187200,,341,4.34375
8081738,1,B000B5XSJ4,"I had to do everything within my power to view this DVD through to the end.  The instructor seemed to be knowledeable, good form and I liked some of the sequencing she did with the exercises but the assistants were awful to watch.  The instructor would have been better just doing the exercises herself and just explaining the modifications.  I don't believe Beginner Girl performed one exercise correctly.  Not only did she not listen to the instructor's directions but when she did seem to undertand the concept, she still performed it incorrectly.  It was hysterical to watch.  I watched this video for the first and last time.  I am a Pilates Instructor hoping to obtain some useful information.  But other than some different sequencing, I'm sorry to say this video was a bust.  Hopefully, beginner girl has taken more classes since the filming of this video.  She should have taken the lessons prior to.  I don't know the producers were thinking on this one.",1254528000,,964,4.817073170731708
8081739,3,B000B5XSJ4,"the workout is pretty challenging for a beginner like me, but i felt it was kinda annoying the way the main fitness instructor explains everything.  she sounds so fake, i don't know if she's reading cue cards or what, or if she's nervous in front of a camera, but she talks like a person who's bad at acting.  She had people in back of her who were supposed to show what the beginner and intermediate level alternatives for certain moves were, if we weren't able to do the advanced level. I thought this was good, but the girl who was supposed to show beginner moves seemed to not be paying attention and seemed lost during the whole entire workout.  The fitness instructor reminded us to have a straight spine throughout the whole workout, but the beginner level girl had the worst posture i've ever seen.  She looked sickly.  The video is missing something, I'm not quite sure what it is, but whatever it is, the lack of it makes this video pretty boring.  Very effective though, i felt the burn.",1177200000,,998,4.516666666666667
8081740,5,B000B5XSJ4,I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this new DVD at such a great price. The workout is fantastic and Lariesa Bernick teaches it in a way that anyone can follow. I have been practicing Pilates for two years now and appreciate the benefit of it. This DVD will definitly improve your range of motion and core strength.,1135123200,,325,4.433333333333334
8081741,5,B000B5XSJ4,"Lariesa Bernick leads the viewer through slow, precise exercises in a way that is easy to follow. I liked that I could follow the basic routine or more advanced routine at the same time. The classic Pilates mat exercises are challenging, and yet she keeps it basic enough for a beginner. This is a great abdominal workout!",1135123200,,322,4.666666666666667
