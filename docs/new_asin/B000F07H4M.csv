8210480,1,B000F07H4M,"I bought this box set in the hope of reliving some great memories and hoping it would uncover some new information about the band that changed my life. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to read on the back cover they state Kurt's suicide occurred in 1993, not 1994, so I was instantly disappointed at the producers lack of journalistic integrity from the outset. Don't buy this if you are a Nirvana fan. It's a bad documentary only made to profit from the death of a great musician who changed my life, if not many others. For a second-rate documentary, I'll paraphrase and use Kurt's own words ""second rate, third degree burns..."" Don't buy this s***e.",1382400000,16,653,4.7368421052631575

DVD #1: Nirvana: A Golden Legacy (Running time: 70 minutes)

While this DVD and its accompanying case are both titled ""Nirvana: A Golden Legacy"", the main feature itself is actually called ""NIRVANA: THE UNTOLD STORIES"", and was previously released as a single DVD using both the title ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nirvana-A-Golden-Legacy/dp/B000IFSGSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nirvana: A Golden Legacy</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nirvana-The-Untold-Stories/dp/B0023W651Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nirvana: The Untold Stories</a>"". This is not an unusual practice for Koch International (which distributes many Chrome Dreams and Silver & Gold products, amongst others), which is quite unfortunate since their video documentaries are actually better than this distributor's questionable strategies would have one believe.

The DVD menu is very plain and basic, and offers the following choices:

- Play Film
- Subtitles (Optional Spanish subtitles only)
- Chapters
- Interactive Trivia Quiz (15 multiple-choice questions about Nirvana)
- Discography
- Beyond DVD (Other available Chrome Dreams products about Nirvana)

The documentary has 11 chapters:

1. Intro
2. Defining Rock
3. Childhood Memories
4. Developing The Sound
5. Musical Influence
6. Going Public
7. Getting Noticed
8. Debut Album
9. Perseverance
10. Fitting Together
11. Forever A Legend

The film opens with a disclaimer: ""This documentary contains no original music by Nirvana. It is not authorized by Nirvana, their record company or their management."" So you have been warned. There are also no interviews with either Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, or Dave Grohl (or any of Nirvana's former members for that matter), nor are there any live performances by Nirvana.

What you will find are snippets of interviews with a variety of people who knew the guys from Nirvana (and Kurt Cobain more specifically) such as journalist Tim Appelo; producer/engineer Jack Endino; Kurt Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain; producer Steve Fisk; music scene-ster Slim Moon; high school friends of Kurt Cobain's, Paul White and Steve Shillinger; Kurt Cobain's best schoolmate Darrin Neathery; Kurt Cobain's biographer, Charles R. Cross (Heavier Than Heaven); studio owner Robert Lang; and band manager Ryan Aigner. There is also an interview with several people who saw Nirvana's very first public performance, and what they remember of that experience.

I thought it was quite interesting to get to know a little bit more about the guys from Nirvana, and Kurt Cobain in particular, through the people who had known them over the course of their lives. While long-time, hardcore fans of the band will probably not learn anything new from this documentary, the anecdotes and opinions related in the various interviews do provide rare glimpses into the lives of Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl, and that alone is what makes this DVD a worthy purchase.

DVD #2: In Utero: A Classic Album Under Review (Running time: 63 minutes)

This documentary combines a series of commentaries by expert contributors around each of the songs comprising the album 'In Utero' with a general narrative about Nirvana that leads up to the making of 'In Utero'.

This DVD, like the previous one, also has a 'plain & basic' menu but offers only 3 choices:

- Play
- Chapters
- Extras

The main feature is divided into 14 chapters:

1. In The Beginning
2. Under The Influence
3. Making The Album
4. Heart Shaped Box
5. Serve The Servants
6. Scentless Apprentice
7. Rape Me
8. Frances' Revenge
9. Dumb
10. Hard Music
11. Penny Royal Tea
12. Not Friendly
13. All Apologies
14. At The End

Additionally, there are 4 'extras':

- Special Feature: Nivana Unplugged - A Classic Album
- Contributor Biographies: The stories behind the DVD's expert contributors
- The Hardest Interactive Nirvana Quiz In The World Ever
- Beyond DVD: More Nirvana related product from Chrome Dreams

What really sets this DVD apart from the previous one is that unlike 'Nirvana: The Untold Stories', 'In Utero: A Classic Album Under Review' does include original music by Nirvana, if only in the form of short clips from live performances, music videos, studio albums and demos. There are also clips from live performances, music videos and studio albums by other influential bands, such as The Melvins, Black Flag, The Pixies, and Big Black (amongst others), and even a clip from a black-and-white movie showing actress Frances Farmer singing 'Come And Get It'!

People who were interviewed for this documentary include: Chad Channing (former Nirvana drummer); Tracy Marander (Kurt's first girlfriend); Ben Thompson (music journalist); Charles R. Cross (author of Kurt Cobain's biography, 'Heavier Than Heaven'); Jack Endino (producer/engineer and owner of Reciprocal Studios); David Stubbs (writer); Mark Paytress (music journalist); Peter Blecha (writer for The Seattle Times); Mark Sutherland (former Melody Maker editor, DJ for BBC 6 radio); Matthew 'Slim' Moon (Seattle scenester and founder of record label Kill All Rock Stars); Tim Appelo (film, TV and music journalist); and Andrew Mueller (journalist).

The quality of 'In Utero: A Classic Album Under Review' is much superior to that of 'Nirvana: The Untold Stories', hands down. Not only is it very informative, but because it mostly uses video footage with only the occasional photo slideshow, 'In Utero: A Classic Album Under Review' makes for a much more dynamic film than 'Nirvana: The Untold Stories', which as a result makes for a much more interesting watch.

Overall, this DVD collection, while not essential, is a nice addition to any true Nirvana fan's collection.

I'll conclude this review with a quote by Tim Appelo, which struck me as being particularly effective in describing Aberdeen: ""Aberdeen is [...] where rains lives.""",1357257600,8,6004,5.496199782844734
