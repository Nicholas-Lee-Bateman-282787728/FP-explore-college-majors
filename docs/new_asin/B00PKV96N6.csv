8688526,1,B00PKV96N6,"The first 12 minutes of DVD I had the feeling of being all improvised , the shots of the cameraman and the ability to maintain static camera is not good , there are many approaches and blurs camera that I particularly bother me further explanation of the material is a bit confusing , as to the first technique ( biomechanical ) there is no explanation of the process clearly, the painter begins the body painting without a working structure , is more a demonstration rather than a didactic process , and thus all the dvd with each of the following techniques , not worth it in my opinion pay the price for this DVD.",1426550400,,616,4.412280701754386
