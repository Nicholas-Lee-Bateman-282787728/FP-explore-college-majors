3423743,2,B00197KG02,I purchased this DVD hoping that it would provide some live music performances of Love during its heyday but was I ever disappointed!!!!  This is just a bunch of interviews with former members of Love including Arthur Lee.  Any music performances shown are short clips-- what a rip!!!!!,1229040000,4,286,4.9375
3423744,4,B00197KG02,"I HAVE BEEN A LOVE FAN SINCE 1967. I AM THRILLED THAT EXPENDED EDITIONS OF THE VARIOUS LPs HAVE FINALLY BEEN RELEASED. THIS DVD HAS SOME VERY DETAILED AND INFORMATIVE INTERVIEWS , WHICH FILLED IN MANY BLANKS FOR ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF LOVE. I GUESS THE ONLY SHORTCOMING FOR ME WOULD BE THAT THEY LARGELY PASSED OVER THE PERIOD FROM ""FOUR SAIL"" ON.  I PERSONALLY LIKED THAT EDITION OF LOVE. APPARENTLY AT LEAST TWO OF THE MEMBERS ARE STILL ALIVE AND COULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED. OVERALL , IT IS A WORTHWHILE EFFORT.",1225238400,4,515,4.537634408602151
3423745,5,B00197KG02,I grew up with LOVE and forever changes is a cd I listen to every couple of weeks. I bought Love albums as soon as they were released.  Arthur Lee and his band were ahead of their time.  I love all the LOVE albums and urge everyone to listen to them and watch as many dvd's on them as possible they were great!

3423746,4,B00197KG02,"Firstly,I've given this dvd 4 stars because it lacks sufficient band footage to illustrate the special something Love had. However,this is not really a criticism of the product itself,as very little material is available(only 2-3 video's from Love's heyday),but it would have been nice to see the full renditions of ""My Little Red Book""and ""Message to Pretty"".What this dvd does do,is evoke a time and place(1960s,Los Angeles,Sunset Strip)with informative,humourous recollections. The participants in Love Story explain the group's rise and subsequent fall with mostly sadness and not bitterness,acknowledging the mistakes made,but rejoicing in the fact that for a short time,Arthur and the boys were the kings of the scene. Particularly insightful are the reminiscences of Johnny Echols:he recalls the good and bad with a sense of balance and maturity. Arthur comes across as slightly wigged out:no acid casualty,but operating to his own rules and impulses;the scenes of his post prison re-emergence are genuinely uplifting and gratifying,especially in light of his death 2 years ago. Also entertaining is Arthur's return to ""the castle"",the band's communal home in the sixties:he seems to really enjoy remembering the fantastic ""experiences"" they had there;a guided tour that you know only touches the surface of what occurred 40 years earlier. In all,this is an excellent music documentary that will please the die hards(like myself) and serve as a great educator to newer fans(who maybe should view this in conjunction with the ""Forever Changes"" live concert dvd).Thoroughly recommended.",1221177600,5,1591,5.605809128630705
3423747,5,B00197KG02,"Superb film. I FINALLY was able to find it in NYC at Virgin (its sold out twice at Rocket Scientist in the Village on St Marks)

WAY too much for an import dvd at Virgin tho. I had to pay $50. OUCH!!

absolutely heartbreaking film. Oh god.. the one band that should've made it, had all the talent, but just burned out..

The film ends at Four Sail, dead. Which may be unfair. But then, how was one to follow up Forever Changes? It really is the best album ever recorded (in my humble opinion!) and if this film can nudge the average Joe to check this album out (or at least Alone Again Or - wisely sequenced by Elektra's Jac Holzman to start the disc) that is not necessarily a bad thing

The film is almost 2 hours - lots of Love, interview. Absolutely heartbreaking. Arthur Lee did get his due, but it was to be much later after a jail term - nice to see UK's Parliament like the album (Forever Changes I mean of course) as well (they put it to a vote in the Parliament, declaring it the best album of all time and pressing people to check out the live Forever Changes tour!)

Video interviews with the late Bryan Maclean from the late 90s (from BBC TV I assume) and audio interviews with the late Kenny Forssi from the early 90s

Extras include Snoopy going solo and Arthur, Johnny interviews, as well as the Parliament guy who did a petition that deemed FC the best album ever made. Right on guys! At least the album did better there in the States (it made the top 30 in the UK - made the top, oh, 160 in the US!)

Snoopy and Johnny are working on albums (H.O.M.E. and FC follow up Gethesemene, respectively). Indeed, you can listen to Snoopys album (and message!) on CDBaby, but, really, this is a celebration of Love in its heyday (the first 3 albums). Nice to hear from ""Fleck"" (co-writer of ""Can't explain"" from the first album) after all this time (he was bassist before he opted out for a film career, and the late Kenny Forssi joined from off the Sufari's tour in time for the first Elektra album (simply titled Love)

Arthur is pretty honest here. In fact, sometimes he comes off as a jerk. Hes honest about Revelation too (which most Love fans are pretty tolerant of, curious considering it takes up a full side!) He thinks its the worst thing hes ever recorded (probably true - its certainly longer than some of the dreck on Vindicator or Out Here) and that there was a terrible vibe between the band members on that particular track

Michael Stuart covers FC for us (the band couldn't get it together due to lack of rehearsals, and the first 2-3 tracks (Daily Planet, etc) cut for the album didn't have them playing at all (Stuart notes that while 7&7 Is took 40 takes to get thru, they got nowhere near as many tries to get the material right

Arranger Angel is talked to (hes very kind about Arthur, and seems honored to have been involved in the album). Echols is probably the star of the film, as hes never really been talked to before and a lot of what he has to say about the background of the group (him and Arthur's parents knowing one another in Memphis, him and Arthur playing a great deal in bands during weekends while still in high school - at fraternities parties and the like, his own feeling in holding a guitar at the school for the first time (which seems to have sparked Arthur, who saw him so)

I understand that the filmmakers were limited in using video footage of the band, so theres no full footage of the band on Where the action is, American Bandstand (this was even a problem in the excellent Beatles Anthology, which had talkovers over Hey Jude on the Frost show

That quibble aside (it would be nice to see Love footage from the 60s on dvd, at least the excellent Your Mind And We film, which originally surfaced on a Love Story (2cd) promo of Rhino's

Indesribably essential if you're a Love/Arthur Lee (RIP)/Bryan Maclean (RIP)/Kenny Forssi/Bobby Beausoleil/John Fleckenstein/Don Conka (RIP) and Baby Lemonade fan!",1220486400,25,3960,4.430536451169188
3423748,5,B00197KG02,No one is a bigger fan of love. Saw them in LA many years ago on the strip. Was just about to buy this for the 20.99 asking price when it jumped to 21.99 then 26.99. Come on amazon this is not fair to the band. This is a must buy but old sixties people are not going to put up with corporate games and greed. Give us back the old price or we will go elsewhere.,1219708800,8,360,3.688311688311688
3423749,5,B00197KG02,"Well, no Ali McGraw, but you do have a top notch documentary about America's great neglected musical genius, Arthur Lee, and his band. The narrative is smart and well paced, the interviews wise, revealing, and occasionally hilarious, and the paucity of live performance footage forgiveable in light of the fact that no one knew at the time that a cult legend was being born. If you are into Love, or want to get into Love, this DVD is a necessity. I think three things happened in the latter part of Arthur's life that turned it from tragedy to triumph; one, he lived long enough to see ""Forever Changes"" widely hailed as a masterpiece, two, he got to tour that album at long last with a great backup band and small orchestra to adoring audiences, and three, this terrific film was made. So to the film-makers - many thanks, it's a great doc, hope it wins an Oscar.",1218931200,7,865,4.515923566878981
3423750,4,B00197KG02,"The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star DVD is the shortage of original band footage.  There really isn't a whole lotta Love footage out there, so the band's many fans would've wanted to see some more clips of Arthur and the guys in action.  But interviews are what make up the bulk of the doc, and the interviews are fascinating, revealing, informative . . . There's lots of Arthur himself talking, lots of Johnny Eccols, some old Bryan MacLean footage, some with Jac Holzman, some Bruce Botnick, other members of Love . . . Wait till you hear Arthur hold forth on The Gulf Wars, George Bush, Tony Blair, etc. in the bonus footage, and have a seat before you play the bonus segment where a modern-day Snoppy Pfisterer performs some of his, uh, current material.  The documentary focuses heavily on Love's first three albums, and of course zeros in on their masterpiece Forever Changes.  There could have been more on post- Changes Love, who were never as good as they were on the first three records, but always had their moments.  But that's a quibble.  Any fan of Love, of 60s psychedelia, of 60s youth culture, of the LA Sunset Strip scene . . . all of you will get something from this excellent documentary.",1218412800,38,1220,4.573394495412844
3423751,5,B00197KG02,"This is a heaven sent for Love fans like myself since their is very little information available on this group. The story of Arthur Lee and Love is one of the biggest enigmas in rock and roll. Despite being one of the biggest bands in LA during the 60's, despite being instrumental in helping The Doors launch their career, and despite making an album 'Forever Changes' that consistenly is listed among rock and roll's greatest records, they never really made it big. Love Story presents a bunch of theories from many of the people involved with the group, including Arthur Lee and surviving members of the group. This documentary also explains the orgins, the dynamics, and makeup of Arthur Lee & his group. I wish they delved a bit more in his life after 'Forever Changes', but you can't be too pickey. The film makers do a excellent job is telling the story, so even people not aware of Love will be entertained. Good show all around.",1216339200,20,937,4.616766467065868
3423752,5,B00197KG02,"I viewed Love Story last week without any real expectations, most documentaries seem to fall into the trap of covering what we already know or offering too much of a personal slant. This film had a good balance of filling in blanks and remaining editorially neutral and will be informative to both fan and curiosity seeker alike.

I enjoyed this film because it gave insight into the other members of the group who, with the exception of Bryan Maclean, were merely just names in liner notes.

As with most good films it left me seeking more and just like a good book it I couldn't put it down. I hope it resonates with a large audience and we will see a renewed interest in this great body of work and the lives it touched. Perhaps, a sequel. I thought it was very well done and outstanding for a first effort from Start. My only disappointment was not enough early performance footage.

If you're a Love fan please listen to my radio program ""Whole 'Nuther Thing"" on 7/26 at 4:30 PM Pacific Time as I feature 90 minutes of Love. [...]",1215907200,13,1035,4.436842105263158

3423755,5,B00197KG02,"If you love ""Love,"" then you will love this documentary!  A behind-the-scenes look at the group, from the earliest days to today.  Arthur Lee even takes us on a journey through his days at high school when he used to ditch school to walk miles to the Capitol Records' office in the hopes that somebody (anybody) would be interested in someone like him.  The interviews are very candid and show us how it truly was for the group at the height of their popularity.  Arthur even takes us on a tour of the  castle where the band lived together in those early days.  A nostalgic look at Arthur's tragic death (and his views on war and death) complete this ""must-have"" item for any true ""Love"" fan.",1369785600,,692,4.4523809523809526
3423756,5,B00197KG02,If you have never heard the 60's band Love then you are missing something from your musical education.  Way ahead of the curve for their time.  Big influence on my music writing.  Watch it and read the book as well.,1358035200,,215,4.325
3423757,4,B00197KG02,Being a fan and having seen the reunion band in 2006 I wanted to know as much as I could about one of the seminal psychedelic rock bands that never quite received the recognition they were due. This documentary takes us back to that time in the late 60's when flower power was preeminant and we thought we could change the world. We were naively innocent and idealistic. We all probably took too many drugs to our detriment and Love was no exception. If Love had been from San Francisco they might have gone much further but who knows what might have been. Arthur Lee was a shooting star that made one more pass 40 years later and now has joined the ancestors.,1282176000,,660,4.373983739837398
3423758,2,B00197KG02,"I am a huge Love fan, but I was disappointed by this documentary, which relies far too heavily on interviews with the (at that time) remaining members of the band, and has far too little actual performance footage.  I consider myself a major Love fan but I found myself fast forwarding through a good portion of the DVD. Frankly, much of the interview dialog borders on being dull. I do not plan on watching a second time.  Not for the casual fan.",1264464000,7,447,4.439024390243903

3423760,5,B00197KG02,"being a huge fan of Arthur Lee and company this is a fantastic documentary.as much as i enjoy listening to Arthur(sadly his last interviews)his tour of the area near Dorsey high,Capitol records,and the ""castle""(Love's residence during the recording of their first 3 albums),to me it was Johnny Echols who provided absolutely fascinating insight into the band(Johnny's story of the Manson clan on the bonus features--WOW!!).yeah i hear what people are saying about not enough vintage performances,but from what i read about him Arthur Lee was not that crazy about being filmed while performing,so maybe that is why,who knows?along with the first 3 classic Love cds get this dvd--this band in their prime could give any group(I MEAN ANY GROUP)a run for their money!!",1241136000,4,764,5.219512195121951
3423761,4,B00197KG02,"Whatever else can be said about Love Story, most viewers will agree that its not for the casual fan. Indeed, it is likely that only hard-core fans will even be interested in seeing it. That is because proper appreciation can only be attained when the viewer comes to it with competent knowledge of the music it celebrates.
The documentary's main focus is on the formative years of the band and the creation of the first three albums. So those who cut their teeth on the earliest incarnations of the enigmatic musical phenomenon that is Arthur Lee and Love will enjoy Love Story most.
What you get is a series of interviews with former band members and a few music industry personalities who were crucial to the band's introduction to the wider listening public all interspersed with live clips of the band and shots of its former haunts. An appropriate soundtrack augments discussions of the chronology of Love's development and eventual demise.
In the course of the documentary, Arthur Lee is often charming but sometimes comes off as an obnoxious boor. You can feel his intellectual heft, but you will also see how his arrogance and caprice kept the band from going on to the heights merited by its rarefied talent. Lee and Johnny Echols blame the putative racism of both the public and the record company, but the reality is that Lee's aversion to the discipline and hard work of touring ensured that Love's base was largely restricted to California.
Lee's musical resurrection and his triumphant Forever Changes concert in England following his release from prison is one of the high points. But in some of the later clips, it is almost painful to watch as an apparently dying Lee(leukemia)struggles to collect and express his thoughts.
Echols contributes almost as much to one's understanding of the band as does Lee and obviously enjoys having been given the opportunity to expound on his memories. Other former members contribute much less with Ken Forssi being heard only on a recorded interview. I find the segments featuring the thoughts of Bryan MacLean to be humorous mainly because he looks like he's facing a firing squad while speaking. The few appearances of Alban ""Snoopy"" Pfisterer are almost as absurd as his nickname and his successor on drums, Michael Stuart-Ware, is given scant opportunity to pontificate.
There are a seven bonus features, the best of which are the illuminating additional commentary of Johnny Echols and Canter's Revisited. Snoopy Goes Solo and When Arthur Met Shack are the worst. Enthusiastic liner notes by Bobby Gillespie would have been more enjoyable if he would have cut the unnecessary profanity in half.
Several good books have been written about Arthur Lee and Love. Love Story fills the documentary void. If you are an old-time Love fan, you will certainly want to add this to your DVD collection.",1234310400,11,2849,4.949895615866389
3423762,5,B00197KG02,"This documentary consists of mostly interviews with the late Arthur Lee and the other surviving members of the 1960's group LOVE. Because hardly any footage exists with the ""Forever Changes"" lineup exists apart from appearances on ""Where the Action Is"" and home movies. Interviews and memories are what you are left with but the directors do a great job of making the film compelling.

Guitarist Johnny Echols gets just about as much screen time as Arthur Lee but Echols seems to give a truer account of the band and its history while trying not to put down anybody. There are also interviews with original bassist and future Standell John Fleckenstien, Snoopy Pfisterer (drummer #2 and keyboardist) Michael Stuart (drummer #3), Elektra records founder Jac Holzman, engineer Bruce Botnik (who produced ""Forever Changes"") and Door's drummer John Densmore. David Angel is also tapped for information because he was the orchestral arranger for ""Forever Changes"" and gives a more musical insight on the way Arthur Lee worked on the arrangements.

There is old interview footage of the late Bryan Maclean, and a taped interview of the late Mike Forrsi. If you want the definitive history of the band LOVE than this is for you.

Be forewarned you may walk away from this film with the impression that Arthur Lee was a self-absorbed jerk and the only reason for the bands failure to make it big was due to his lack of motivation while blaming everybody and everything for his failure instead of himself. And you would be right because that's the saddest thing about the group, they could have been as big as the Doors but they choose to bum around LA content with being a popular group in California while blaming Elektra records for lack of promotion and racism.

The DVD also comes with bonus footage and contains extended interviews with Echols, and Arthur Lee. Then there is some extra footage with Snoopy, in which he demonstrates the proper way to listen, dance and dress when listening to his new compositions. Overall, a great package for fans of 60's rock as well as documentaries.",1231804800,12,2083,4.8923512747875355
