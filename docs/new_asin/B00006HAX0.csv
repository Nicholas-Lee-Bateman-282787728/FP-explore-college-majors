8591078,5,B00006HAX0,"For all you Full Moon Movies Fans, I have a treat for you. This DVD comes with the full versions of Deathbed starring Tanya Dempsey and Stuart Gordon's Castle Freak. Deathbed has a good suspensfull story that will draw you in wondering what will happen next? Castle Freak is another great movie BUT IT IS GRAPHIC!! If you have a weak stomach then this might bother you. For all you hardcore gore fans this is an AWESOME film. Fangora Magazine gave this movie lots of praise! Full Moon Studios produced both of these films and make it a worthy addition to anyone's horror collection.",1074902400,,582,4.605769230769231
