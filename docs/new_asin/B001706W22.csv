8264266,4,B001706W22,"First let me say that this is a 4X3 non high definition video and appears somewhat grainy on a large screen TV.

The sound is good, but not great. Virtually no documentation or notes on von Karajan.

Good to see the somewhat frail looking von Karajan so ebullient in this lighter enchanting Viennese music. He is again united with the orchestra with which, after being from the de-nazifiacation program, he started his log and very productive and distinguished post war career. As you expect from the VPH the performances are all little stylistic gems, played as to the manner born with all of the ""luftpausesn""in the right places.. The Kathleen Battle solo  is beautifully done.

Some nice pictures of the famous Spanish Riding Academy and ballet sequences from various venues and palaces in Vienna.

There are two domains here. Little needs to be said of the music. This is the most famous Strauss concert of all time. It has a sense of occasion and more. Whatever this music stands for - joy and radiance, melancholy and sadness, loss and longing - is encapsulated here exquisitely. Beyond all expectations, the Vienna Philharmonic surpasses itself which is not easily done in this domain.  The sonority it invokes at the commencement of Sphrenklnge IS the Music of the Spheres. Kathleen Battle comes to the party with her flawless coloratura in Frhlingsstimen - and the nags of the Spanish Riding School stomp around with great lan. Father Melchizedek OP, the High Priest of Period Practice, can be seen sitting next to Eliette von Karajan and boisterously enjoying himself for all to see.

 But the real interest here is Karajan himself and the image he projects.

Herbie has long been flagellated for his membership of the Nazi Party and rightly so. It was a shirt of Nessus he wore for the remainder of his life. Not that he materially extended the war or sent anyone to the gas-chambers but it was infamy all the same. Troubling as it is, I have always been more bothered by his phaoronic attitude to lesser mortals. Vaughan recounts an episode where he mocked a cleaning-woman who was going about her chores in the Philharmonie. Well remunerated though they were, his lackeys and sycophants regularly had ""to assume the position"" to allow their master to vent his wider frustrations. Who can forget Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's salute to the Ides of March:

. . . . . . . Karajan and I did some marvellous work together. I must give him his due but I do have to say that Karajan was an utterly bad character. In my case and in the case of my husband, it was so utterly awful. Although he was a great conductor, the behaviour of Karajan was such that we have no reason, even after his death, to say he was a great man. He was not. He was somebody who wielded his might over everyone else. He was really a `Macht' possessor and he used that power in a very very awful way. But we are talking about Furtwangler, aren't we?

True, Mrs Legge had an axe to grind but her ire is credible. Talented and ambitious in equal measure, Karajan ruthlessly crowned himself as General Music Director of Europe and left a $300m fortune. This dynamic is visible in many of his videos from the 60s to the mid 80s where Herbie, immaculately groomed and perfumed, is the focus of attention like an oversized central pane in a Rose Window.  He partakes of Olympus. Our obeisance and worship are demanded. Nary a smile is to be seen.

And yet the Herbie on display here in this 1987 New Year's Concert is arguably a different being - at least publicly. Evidence: the glitter in his eyes as Kathleen Battle makes a grand appearance; his frolics at the closure of Unter Donner und Blitzen; his wryness upon forgetting the entry for Ohne Sorgen and the unforgettable moment when he turns around to face the audience in the middle of the Radetzky March. And who gave him permission to smile so often? Is this not a man who is asking to be . . . well, loved and needily so? To what could one attribute such a change? His tribulations do not need to be listed. Could Aescyhlus be pertinent?

He who learns must suffer
And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget
Falls drop by drop upon the heart,
And in our own despite, against our will,
Comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.

With Herbie as anti-Herbie, this Concert raises as many question as it answers. It is never less than fascinating. Musically it is a treat.

Gun stuff.",1341878400,2,3706,4.523168908819133
8264268,4,B001706W22,"This release is a puzzle to me regarding the sound. It seems that Sony undertook a project with their von Karjan videos to play back the audio portion in the original recording venue and re-record it to capture the hall ambience and re-master the audio in surround sound. However, this video and the video of the 1983 New Year's concert do not have surround sound. This can be seen by the lack of a black logo in the lower left-hand corner of the cover. What is so very strange to me is that a few of the earlier Sony von Karajan video releases were already in surround sound and this was one of them. The booklet inside suggests that some re-mastering may have taken place, but it is not at all clear.
The music is marvelous and it is fascinating to see Karajan in a lighter mood.",1232928000,2,781,4.319727891156463
