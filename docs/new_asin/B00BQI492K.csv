However, the people involved in this project seem to have convinced themselves that one of the remains belongs to John Ruddy without conclusive proof. It is stated that DNA testing would be conducted; some source claim that it was, other indicate that it was not. According to 'IrishCentral' (March 1, 2013): ""both time and money have not permitted for the tests to be conducted. Despite this, Dr. Janet Monge from the University of Pennsylvania, who worked hands-on with the research, said it's unlikely Ruddy could be anybody else."" Regardless of how compelling the circumstantial evidence may be, there's always a chance that it could be someone else. But I guess knowing for sure is now no longer a possibility.",1381881600,,865,5.055944055944056
