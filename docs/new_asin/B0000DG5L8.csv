1924410,5,B0000DG5L8,"I have the all regions DVD version.

It is worth mentioning that the majority of the documentary is in Finnish with English subtitles. If subtitles bug you, this DVD may not be for you.

With a length of approx 2 hrs (if my memory serves me correctly), it is a DVD I tend to watch over a couple of sittings. With its mixture of interview with Tuomas & Jukka, and footage of recording albums, touring and hanging out, I notice something new each time I watch it.

Note, mainly revolves around Tuomas, Jukka, Marco and some of the roadies. Ie not too much Tarja or Emppu.

The interview with Tuomas shows a man who despite having changed through having a successful band, does not appear to have an ego. Runs through the forming of the band, the circumstances of Sami leaving, and talks about the ease or difficulty of recording each album, and much much more.

Beautiful shots of their home town of Kitee and Tuomas' island.

Lots of funny bits. Eg. Naked bungee jumping (with appropriate bits covered for the DVD), standard drunken tour moments (but doesn't overwhelm the DVD), and more.

The live section of the DVD isn't the greatest. I tend to view it as a bit of a support for the documentary. Basically, I wouldn't buy it for the live performance alone.

Hope this helps!",1113696000,32,1276,4.541484716157205
1924411,5,B0000DG5L8,"Just for clarification, the edition I have is made by NEMS Enterprises and purchased out of Argentina. I have no complaints for audio quality. I'm running 2.1 speakers. This DVD is worth getting alone for the 6 songs performed at the Summer Breeze festival in 2002-- End of All Hope, Dead to the World, 10th Man Down, Slaying the Dreamer, Over the Hills and Far Away, and Sleeping Sun.

There is a wealth of additional material on here; the 2 concert performances (5 and 6 songs, respectively), the interview with Toumas for MTV Brasil (in English), photo galleries, etc. Any Nightwish fan should get this.",1110672000,10,606,4.771428571428571
1924412,3,B0000DG5L8,"Don't buy if you want a show. The sound and the camera in the show are very poor. Not far from amateur. What is good in quality is the story of Nightwish in 2 hour 15 minutes in Finnish subtitle in english.
For fan who want everything on Nightwish",1109635200,4,247,4.061224489795919
1924413,2,B0000DG5L8,"I love Nightwish, but this DVD was not a good investment.  I know that I sound lazy when I say that I don't like subtitles, but I wish that there was an English overdub option for the documentary part.  It would make life a little easier.  Even though I'm not happy about the subtitles, that's not my main complaint.  The sound quality during the live performances is horrible.  The one performance is in mono and sounds like there was a single mic, placed in the crowd , used to record it.  The other performance actually utilizes surround sound but all of the low end is gone.  My subwoofer was pretty much useless for both live performances.  I feel bad saying such horrible things about a Nightwish DVD, but it's depressing to see such fine music be butchered like this.  I hope that From Wishes to Eternity is better and I hope that the next DVD has better mic placement and better mixing work.",1108684800,4,899,4.466257668711656
1924414,5,B0000DG5L8,"I have been a Nightwish fan for a while now and I never got a chance to get my hands on the DVD, they're rare in stores. This documentary really wakes you up to the life of Nightwish, its incredible how a small band from Kitee, Finland erupted into such a great band. Like any other music group, they face hardships and other problems. Tuomas shows his feelings about his lost friendship with Sami Vanska, who was replaced by Marco Hietala. This film reveals the rock-star life of Nightwish and their life outside of the band. There is tons of live footage, which includes some of their earlier gigs. The DVD also has many features such as 2 music videos, 2 sets of live shows, and a pointless photo slideshow. Even if you are new to Nightwish, this is must have. The music is unmistakably beautiful and the sound is great.",1104624000,3,823,4.456953642384106
1924415,2,B0000DG5L8,"The sound quality in one of the concerts is terrible to say the least. Half of the audio tracks are probably recorded with a monophonic voice recorder - at least they sound like this.

The band history (narrated in Finnish if I'm not mistaken) is boring. Would've put one star, but I like Nightwish and hope that their new DVD would be mastered by professionals.",1103846400,8,362,4.569230769230769
1924416,5,B0000DG5L8,"Be warned all ye Tarja lovers. She's not heavily featured in this so if you want it thinking she's all you ever see, that's not what you're going to get. Besides, Tuomas is THE man behind everything.

I picked up the region 0 Limited Edition last year when Nightwish originally released this DVD. If you're a huge Nightwish fan, it's a must buy. Chronicles the history of the band with its ups and downs in an interview with Tuomas and Jukka. Lots of behind the scene footage included. You finally get to see just how much this band parties. Also some very nice footage of the area Tuomas grew up in as that's where the documentary was filmed.

Everything is in Finnish with English subtitles.

As a bonus you also get the End Of All Hope and Over the Hill and Far Away videos. Two seperate live concerts with one in 5.1 sound, and a maze of a photogallery that has a trick in getting to see every photo they include.",1101340800,11,917,4.350877192982456
8000887,5,B0000DG5L8,"My recommendation would be that this be for hard-core Nightwish fans only. This is disjointed, very hard to follow. But if you love Nightwish, you will sit through it and be happy regardless.  If you want a good concert DVD/Blu-ray (with good sound), I recommend the Showtime Storytime Wacken 2013 DVD.  (All MHO, of course).",1458086400,,325,4.890909090909091
8000888,5,B0000DG5L8,Really enjoyed the documentary.  Gives an interesting look at the band's early years.,1454198400,,85,5.538461538461538
8000889,4,B0000DG5L8,"Impressive documentary regarding the formation and first years of the iconic melodic metal band Nightwish.

Tuomas Holopainen provides a very long and intimate interview discussing his weaknesses, sources of inspiration for the remarkable letters of the band (with the funny exception of the scent of a woman), his feelings regarding life and music and also the love for his hometown, a true haven in the middle of a maelstrom.

Jukka and other members of the band, associates and friends also provide commentaries, although its mostly a Tuomas show.

From the studio, to the life on tour with liters of booze and craziness in spades, you will accompany this iconic band from the idea of the band, through the scary early successes till the consecration as one of the main metal bands in the world.

Its curious that Tuomas confess that, after having extreme difficulties dealing with the large amount of stress of a life on the run of a band member, he was the first to propose to dissolve the band in 2001; although he recognized the error of that decision and recanted. Recognizing his failures and frailnesss (like in the Sami issue) in front of a camera isn't easy and requires a lot of guts and intellectual honesty.

The extras are interesting; they include an interview MTV Brazil, Two mini concerts: 4 de July Norway and Summer Breeze Festival 2002, it also includes the most confusing and infuriating photo gallery and two video clips - ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" and ""End of All Hope"". The sound of the concerts is truly ghastly, which is a shame.
This documentary is Finnish spoken and has English subtitles. Highly recommended for fans of the band.",1427932800,,1664,4.824561403508772
8000890,5,B0000DG5L8,I loved it because it was the best video i ever seen better than any movies i ever seen. awesome,1377043200,,96,3.85
8000891,5,B0000DG5L8,"This video is mainly a documentary with some live music thrown in there. It tells the story of the band and has a lot of footage of them on the road. It is mainly if Finnish with English sub-titles, but it is worth it. It is really funny! I laughed out loud throughout.  I was even funnier watching it after I had the pleasure of meeting the band.

Just know that this is not a concert video, but it is fantastic.",1221436800,,413,4.08641975308642
8000892,1,B0000DG5L8,"...this DVD sucks. only interviews and Tarja barely talks, probably because when they making this this DVD, she already was the ""diva wannabe"" that is now (thanks Marcelo). only few concerts but at the end, this DVD it's only for real fans of Nightwish. and only has english subtitles.",1202515200,,285,4.836734693877551
8000893,5,B0000DG5L8,"This DVD is awesome. It's a documentary DVD, so don't look for any good-quality songs here. But it's still BLOODY HILLARIOUS!",1197072000,,125,5.0
8000894,5,B0000DG5L8,"Because he is soo shy and his private life is very hermetic I can only talk about his musical mind,..and finally that's the important thing isn't it?..as a musician he is brilliant ,..as a composer he is a god,..a very depressed ,..shy and desesperate for something to hold on to life is what Tuomas Holopainen really is and this DVd will show you that,..lots of interesting footage and the emptiness sometimes of the muscician's life is a reality that none of us could deny,..A MUST FOR ANY FAN OR EVEN A CURIOUS LISTENER OF THIS GREAT BAND,...",1192492800,,545,4.628865979381444
8000895,3,B0000DG5L8,"Nightwish is my favorite metal band of all time. I own most of the band's cds and was fortunate to have seen the band live before the dismissal of Tarja Turunen. After listening to their music recently, I had to check out one of their dvds as a trip down memory lane. ""End of Innocence"". Most of the dvd consists of a chat with Tuomas, the band's founder and composer with a few comments here and there from the drummer. This was around the end of the Century Child tour for the beand. As most reviewers have written here, the sound on the dvd isn't so hot. It is pretty bad to be honest. The cinematography isn't any better either. The sound and cinematography left me with the impression that this documentary was thrown together at the last minute and on a really tight budget. I did though like seeing behind the scenes footage of the band as well as the videos for ""End of Ages"" and ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". I just wished that more thought and effort was put into this dvd. This dvd felt too lazy and cheaply made.",1169683200,,1025,4.288659793814433
8000896,2,B0000DG5L8,"I love Nightwish, I think they brought freshness to a metal scene that was screaming for something new. Call it goth metal, power metal whatever at the end it is very very melodic and that's exactly what I love about them.

This DVD is cool for the Nightwish fans it features a extensive documentary about the band which is fun but not must have material.

It also features a few songs (very good ones) from different footage in different countries but the sound is not good.

So, Up to you!!",1140739200,,492,4.444444444444445
