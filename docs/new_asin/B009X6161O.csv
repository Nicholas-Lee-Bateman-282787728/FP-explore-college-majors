8544846,5,B009X6161O,We don't have cable or watch the mindlessness of tv because of most of it being a complete waste of time.  That being said we do love movies and certain tv series.  Now that we have a toddler running around the house we found that she loves watching World World (and Super Why) and it's great to see that it's both entertaining and educational.  It gives her something to watch in the mornings without having to deal with commercials.  I can't say that it will keep an adult riveted but even I find it mildly entertaining enough to watch through once or twice.,1381363200,,560,4.407766990291262
