8198906,1,B000GRTR60,The quality of this dvd was awful and appeared to look like a very poor bootleg copy. I do not recommend purchasing this dvd.,1365552000,,125,4.25
8198907,2,B000GRTR60,"Too bad the soundtrack is so muffled to be almost unintelligible.
Too bad, good story.",1248048000,,86,4.8
8198908,5,B000GRTR60,"If you are interested in how the criminal mind works, this is an excellent film for you. The Kray Brothers are scary.",1210204800,2,117,4.363636363636363
8198909,5,B000GRTR60,"I lived in London during this period and this movie sums up how violent, sadistic and vindictive the Krays could be.

But they loved their mum and that is portrayed superbly throughout the movie. I'd recommend this to any tru-crime movie fan!

The classic line in the movie is

""When people are afraid of you, you can do anything. Remember that.""",1172534400,,346,4.639344262295082
