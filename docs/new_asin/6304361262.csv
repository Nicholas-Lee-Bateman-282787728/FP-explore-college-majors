She had lent me her copy of the movie but when I put the 1st tape in my VCR it broke, so I ordered her another set from Amazon and told her what happened.  She could not believe that I could find such an old movie, but I told her that if anyone had it, it would be on Amazon.  Thanks for coming through for me!",1252540800,2,412,4.0
7868939,5,6304361262,"Lady Boss was released in 1992. It is a television mini series. It stars Kim Delaney and Jack Scalia. A great sequel to Lucky Chances. Jackie Collins writes her usual over the top Hollywood stars and gangster mix ! Lots of fun here as Lucky buys Panther Studios. Fans of Hollywood glitz, and lots of mob action will like this the most.",1521331200,,335,4.419354838709677
7868940,5,6304361262,Lady Boss was just as good a mini series as it's predecessor Lucky/Chances. Lady Boss focuses on an older Lucky Santangelo and her husband Lennie Golden. Both were recast with Kim Delaney and Jack Scalia. And the supporting cast is great as well. Steven Dimes returns played by the same actor from Lucky/Chances. I give this film 5 stars. The only thing missing was Gino who is not present in this film. I know these mini series all were from the early 90's but there is many other books in The Santangelo Saga now and I would love to see them come out as a made for TV movie or mini series. Especially since in the newer books Lucky's kids are now older.,1482883200,,655,4.333333333333333

7868947,5,6304361262,"Great for a rainy day, movie day. I really enjoyed this box set. It came very quickly, excellent condition. I prefer the lead actress in this series rather than Nicola Sheridan in the lucky, chances movies. Enjoyed looking back at how decadent the 80s were. Enjoyable, I  recommend this miniseries.",1364947200,,298,4.96
