3791798,2,B001TKK3I4,"Unfortunately this was the first Gundam series I came across. Setsuna's cliche brand of Atheism is about as annoying as they come. ""Im gonna fight for my OWN will"" ""God does not exist."" ""After death there is no God "" no God No God so there!!!. It made me wanna scream ALRIGHT I GET IT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD. WHO CARES?!!! Shutup already. I don't know why anybody would use the word ""pretty boy"" to describe anyone on this show. No pretty faces here. What annoyed the heck out of me was the incessant cursing. Half the series summed up would be ""BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP I am Gundam!"". Annoying and one of the primary reasons I decided to stop watching this show. The protaganist is stupid, angsty, and whiny. Througout the series you find him backing up his cliche personality by saying that he's searching for answers to the old list of philosophical questions about man and God. I liked only one character in the series. The crazy guy; Allehuiah Hsaptism but even that wasn't enough to keep me watching the show. It got two stars from me because its' theme song rocks. My advice: Download the theme song off the internet and forget about this useless piece of crud. it isn't worth buying so don't waste your money or time. I'm gonna check out some of the earlier ones. I suggest you do the same.",1285286400,2,1303,4.548936170212766
3791799,4,B001TKK3I4,"Well, I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who is obsessed with Gundam, but personally I've never really gotten into any Gundam series, Wing or Seed included.  From an objective point of view, I thought the animation quality was really good, especially with the new HD quality visuals, the mobile suits were all pretty tight, and sound quality was good as well.
Ok, so here comes the subjective part.  In terms of storyline, so far I can't say that I'm really impressed.  It just seems like every Gundam series is basically cast from the same mold: some sinister military organization has somehow gained a lot of power, and its up to a band of androgenous teenagers to use their obscurely procured Gundam suits to save the day.  This has been the plot of every Gundam series since 1980.  The characters are all totally emotionless drones.  And above all, the script could have been better written by my dog.
So bottom line: if you're really not and never were into Gundam, this series brings no surprises.  If you're already a fan (and if you are, you probably don't find any of my aforementioned criticisms salient), then you'll probably like the series.",1252368000,,1163,4.671568627450981
3791800,4,B001TKK3I4,"I've finished watching this series and I must say that it's one of the better series. As a gundam fan that started with Gundam Wing I can say that I am very please with the story that gundam designs. What I'm especially pleased with is the very limited recycling of animation which we see a lot in Gundam SEED Destiny (which is still another one of my favorites). I only wished that some things were a little better explained and it kind of annoyed me that the gundams had numerous other features that you would see in the manga or the model kits, but you never see or hardly see used in the anime. An explain of this was that 00 Gundam actually had a 7 sword system much like Exia did. But towards the end of the series, Setsuna has only the GN sword 3 in use for the final battles. He never bothered to combine his GN swords 2 until his final battle with Mr. Bushido. There are a few others I'm sure most other gundam fans are aware of. Aside from that being a little annoying to find out, the story was just a bit predictable. I think it's great addition to the gundam line with many first times in the series. Which had me smiling and rewatching. A must for gundam fans.",1244419200,5,1174,4.199115044247788
3791801,3,B001TKK3I4,"I have been a fan of Gundam for a long time and I have to say that this series was a real disappointment.  And no I am not judging this series based on the other Gundam lines, I am judging it on the fact that it is just a mediocre series.  First off the characters are just awful, never have I watched an anime with a more standard, stock and boring cast.  Every cast members seems to be just there to ""fill the roll"" and after a while it gets old.  Example, the main gundam pilots, feminine one, the quite one who happens to be psycho, the trigger happy one and the standard main pilot of the series who is almost cut and copy of every other main gundam pilot we have seen before.  The mecha designs, well at first it was a relief to see some original designs after the f-fest that was all the unoriginal designs of Gundam Seed, but after a while the designs got old and seemed to blend together leaving no real awe.  Lastly there is just no drama here, the action is good and that gets the three stars but the story is lame and has been done before.  So in the end not the best series, I think flashy images and fast battles are more appealing to people that story telling or good story telling.  But I will say that the animation is solid, best in a while, since Gundam Seed had just boring animation.  Rock on.",1243209600,,1314,4.141732283464567
3791802,5,B001TKK3I4,"Hands down, Gundam 00 is quite possibly the best Gundam to date (up there with Char's Counterattack and 08th team - and nowhere near that horrible Gundam Wing series). The action is over the top, the plot, while similar in some respects to other Gundam series, it varies in that it didn't fall off into that ridiculous, destroy the suit not the pilot sort of crap. It's a tad more visceral than the others. It was also novel in that they mirrored real-world events and shied away from space colonies. It's vibrant, exciting and very little in the way of plot droppage. If you like Gundam, then this one surely will not disappoint.",1241568000,3,630,4.584070796460177
3791803,5,B001TKK3I4,"UPDATE:

After buying and finally getting this box set I come to find out that it only the first 9 episodes out of 25 for season one, and the reason for this box set cost more than the one that isn't SE is because this one comes with the first Manga for Gundam 00 and the first Manga for Gundam 00F. I have a feeling there will be 3 box sets for season one, since the next box set has two DVD's in it as well as this one did, but the 2nd box set's run time is only 200 mins in all where this one was 225 min. So I have a feeling the next box set will only have 8 episodes in it. Which leaves 8 episodes for the 3rd box set for season one. To tell you the truth, I was a bit shocked and disappointed to get only 9 episodes for the price I paid, but I also got the mangas, so it's not so bad, but I would have rather had the other official manga that is out for Gundam 00. for the art and the story line are a bit better it in. The manga they put in there for the SE is too comical for my liking. It makes everything into somewhat of a joke, where the show itself isn't comical. But having the Gundam 00F manga was a joy for me, since I haven't been able to find it state side what so ever, but it woudln't have killed me to wait to find it later on either. If you really don't want the mangas then I would say get the other box set since it's cheaper, or just wait all together and get the full box set when it comes out (which will be in about a year I'm thinking) This anime is still one of the best in my book, I just wish I would have known about the manga they put in here first, because as I said before, I really didn't like the style of that manga. I wish I would have saved my money and gone out to buy the other official manga for Gundam 00 since it's more of the true Gundam 00 style.

(THIS CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS!!!)

Contrary to what other reviews have said, this show is well worth watching. It has some of the best plot, characters, and Gundams you could ever see in any Gundam show. Here is just a bit of background on the show, Characters, and popularity stats:

Background:

The series is set in 2308 AD. As a result of the depletion of fossil fuels, humanity had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of massive arrays of solar power collectors orbiting the Earth, and supported by three orbital elevators, each one serving one of the three ""power blocs"" on the planet, namely UNION, controlling the region surrounding North America, Human Reform League, consisting of China, Russia and India, and AEU, which controls mainland Europe.
With this nearly inexhaustible source of energy benefiting only the major powers and their allies, constant warfare erupts around the globe among minor countries for fuels and energy. Countries that once economically relied on the sale of fossil fuels have plunged into poverty. Some even believe that solar energy threatened the ""promised land of God"", resulting in the 20-year Solar Wars. This chaos led to the formation of a private military organization, called Celestial Being, dedicated to eradicating war and uniting humanity through the use of four humanoid machines called Gundams. Mobile Suit Gundam 00 follows four mobile suit pilots termed Gundam Meisters, sided with Celestial Being. The main protagonist is 16-year old Setsuna F Seiei, a quiet, taciturn young man who grew up in the war-torn Krugis Republic. He pilots the GN-001 Gundam Exia, a high mobility mobile suit effective in melee combat.

Characters:

Setsuna F Seiei
He is the primary protagonist of the show and was discovered by Celestial Being at the age of 14 for having special potential as a pilot. He is currently a Gundam Meister for their organization, piloting the Gundam Exia specialized in melee combat.

Lockon Stratos
Lockon decided to join Celestial Being after losing his parents and little sister to terrorists in Ireland; because of this, he loathes terrorists. As the eldest pilot, he is considered the team leader of the Gundam Meisters, and sports a more easygoing, flamboyant personality as compared to the other Gundam Meisters. He owns an orange Haro to control Gundam Dynames.

Allelujah Haptism
Allelujah spent his childhood as an orphan in the Human Reform League as a Super Soldier experimental subject, designated ""E-57"". He is the pilot of Gundam Kyrios which specialize in high mobility and are able to transform into mobile armors (fighter jets).

Tieria Erde
Gundam Meister of the heavily armored Gundam Virtue, Tieria treats Veda's (there super computer) orders with high regard, valuing the mission above all other issues. His arrogance and cold attitude towards others, his relationship with the other Gundam Meisters got off a rocky start, but later learns to care for the other Meisters. Of all the Gundam Meisters, Tieria is the one with the most unknown past.

Popularity:

While critically acclaimed, the first season of Gundam 00 experienced lower average ratings than its predecessors Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Over its 25 episode run, it averaged a rating of 4.85% and peaked at 6.1%. On a more positive note, Gundam 00's average rating was higher than the other previous Gundam shows set in alternative universes such as Gundam Wing (which averaged 4.3%) and G Gundam (which averaged 4.1%).
In a top 20 anime poll published in the April 2008 issue of Newtype magazine, Japanese readers voted for Gundam 00 as the best anime, higher than its predecessor Gundam SEED, which was voted ninth. In Newtype's poll for top 10 male anime characters, Setsuna F Seiei was voted second, Tieria Erde third, Lockon Stratos fifth, Graham Aker sixth and Allelujah Haptism at seventh; and in its poll for top ten female anime characters, Nena Trinity was voted eighth and Marina Ismail was voted tenth.
At the Anime News Network website, the first season of Gundam 00 has an average rating of 8.4/10 and ranked #129 in its top 250 anime poll as of October 18, 2008, while the second season has an average rating of 9/10 and is ranked #14 in its top 250 anime poll as of December 13, 2008.",1240358400,13,6114,4.568430656934306

3791805,2,B001TKK3I4,"Each to their own, but this series is not for fans of anything Universal Century. Pure pretty boy fluff. Not surprising since the target audience for this series in Japan is teenage girls. The mecha designs are nice though!",1238630400,7,223,4.743589743589744
3791806,5,B001TKK3I4,"I really enjoyed the first season of this and I am currently watching the second season which will end in about 1-2 weeks concluding this fantastic series. Anyways back the the the main topic. This series has arguably the best animation in a Gundam series ever and the first to be produced in wide screen HD format. The mech designs are all unique and colorful, The character developement is also well played and the story is quite solid. I could not compare this series to Gundam Wing even though they share similarities to each other. But each have their own twists and settings and characters. Overall if you are a mecha fan or Gundam fan I highly recommend this series. I'm positive you will not regret it.",1237852800,16,710,4.5984251968503935

Great characters and a new premise about starting a war to end all wars by making sure nobody can fight.  Plenty of mystery and most of the staple aspects of Gundam to be found such as various types of mobile suits each able to get upgrades and the like down the line.  Fantastic music as well.

I much prefer the Japanese character voice acting compared to the American voice actors due to the variation between characters vocals as some of the American voice actors sound similar.  Having said that however, this does not deserve a $300 price tag as the price they are asking for is 6 times retail value, and that's a horrible deal IMO.",1426291200,4,544,4.376237623762377

3791842,4,B001TKK3I4,"I remember me and my brother first saw this anime on tv when it was airing on the Sci-Fi channel back in either 2007 or 2008. My brother and I loved watching it (we are gundam fans!). Then years later in 2012 Bandai Entertainment was shutting down so they had this sale on all of their dvds. I got this (the complete season 1) for around 29 bucks! It came in really fast and it has both the dub and the sub. The quality is amazing. The only issue I had with the dvd was that I didn't like how the disks were kinda crammed together. I have some complete anime dvds and the disks were separate. Whenever I took out one of the dvds, I was scared that I might break it (I haven't broken them and made sure that I was very careful) Other than that this is great! I recommend!",1393977600,,770,4.03921568627451
3791843,3,B001TKK3I4,"The show is great, the quality on the discs is good, but I'm giving this 3 stars because a couple of the discs have a very strange issue. When we put them in the blu-ray player or the Xbox, they aren't recognized. The Xbox says they disc isn't compatible, and the blu-ray acts like nothing's in there. But when we put the discs in the computer, it reads that they're Gundam, we put the discs back in the blu-ray or Xbox, and they work fine. Not all the discs have this problem, but the discs that do have it every single time. It's the weirdest thing.",1389916800,,551,4.2075471698113205

3791845,5,B001TKK3I4,This is one of my favorite anime. Its really well written. The characters and the story just merge so smoothly. They put a lot of work into making this. I believe its a masterpiece,1386460800,,180,4.323529411764706
3791846,5,B001TKK3I4,"Gundam 00 is the most original Gundam series we've had since Turn A, and the best non-Tomino series since Gundam X. These two things, by themselves, do not guarantee quality nor greatness, but thankfully 00 manages to succeed in both respects. 00 season 1 is a breath of fresh air for any Gundam fan out there who just wants to enjoy their giant robot drama without the same trite and uninspired Universal Century clichs that have long plagued the AU Gundam franchise. (Gundam SEED I am looking right at you!) Its fun, its engaging, its also the first Gundam in HD so the animation is very nice, none of the characters are annoying and the comic relief is played just right. Its really what Gundam Wing should have been, instead of that badly written mess with a truckload of UC rehashes we got.

This is the first Mobile Suit Gundam in my Collection, why you may ask its because of the price. Gundam Wing goes for $100, G Gundam goes for $200, and Gundam 00 went for $50 when i bought it. keep in mind thats only one season for all 3 of those pricepoints. I bought Gundam 00 because i needed some Gundam in my collection. Gundam 00 is epic throughout the whole season, its just fight after fight, the story is believeable since we are stuck in a world of war. I love the animations not a surprise since most of the Gundam series is known for its beautyfull scenery. Top notch Voice acting and the fact its Gundam is totally worth the $50. I will get the Second season for $50 also, but i seriously wish someone gets the right to Gundam since it would be a more affordable purchase. 5/5.",1375401600,,928,4.219101123595506

The series itself, while presenting some mature themes, is an epic saga of the struggle of the GUNDAM pilots, as well as showing the impact on several other people, from civilians Sagi & Louise, to other pilots in the various militaries.

The characters are fairly standard for Gundam, but what makes them really shine is their histories and the motivations behind joining Celestial Being or the various other militaries.
The animation is outstanding, and the battle scenes are amazingly well done. Director Mizushima's (of Fullmetal Alchemist fame) vision for this series was very ambitious, as the staff discuss in one of the extras, but it pays off in a big way.
There are a large number of characters, but the designs and colors make it fairly easy to tell who's who, so this is a good place to start for someone who's never seen a Gundam season before.
If you're a fan of mecha, drama, action, and good storytelling, you owe it to yourself to check this series out.",1333670400,6,814,4.659722222222222
3791873,5,B001TKK3I4,"This is not a review to say how great Gundam 00 or how great previous Gundam series were.  Each Gundam series (except Gundam Seed Destiny and a few other offshoots) tends to start from scratch with a new fictional future, and new characters.  Gundam 00 is a new series where the future is one that is oddly foreseeable.  The world has depleted the supply of fossil fuel, so the only resource available is to harness solar power.  But to harness solar power on the scale needed to power the planet, 3 orbital solar power stations were built.  The Middle East fell into ruin after the oil dried up and the foreign powers abandoned those countries.  The countries where the solar elevators were built (along the equator) are targets of struggle and terrorism, despite their apparent fortune.

The world is dominated by three superpowers, but there are still many countries around the globe that war over finite resources.  Those superpowers have control of the solar power and can literally 'shut off' a country.  So even independent countries must bend a knee towards one of these superpowers.

The Gundam Meisters are in an organization called Celestial Being.  They are an anti war organization that uses armed intervention to end conflict (kind of ironic).  We do see that there is more than meets the eye, especially as this first half of the series moves to the conclusion.  And there is a nice demarcation between season one and two (which takes place a couple of years later).

The Japanese voice acting is a real treat.  I have listened to the English dubbing, but I still prefer the Japanese voice cast.  The music is very nice and everything is presented in high quality digital audio.  The mixing and editing is nice, so you actually get movie quality sound effects instead of the same overly repeated explosion sound of previous series.

The series starts off almost too fast. You are introduced to probably a dozen or so central characters and not really given much time to catch your breath.  I highly recommend watching through a second time soon after watching through the first season (I did and it helped).  I might also recommend watching the first 5 or 6 episodes then possibly re watching them just to clarify a few items.  At times it seems you might need a Gundam wiki at hand just to keep straight the three superpowers and which character is working for which power!  It all gets a little clearer later on, but this is really the only negative I can think of.

The animation is top quality, backgrounds are stunning.  The story moves along well and is full of plotting, revenge, and intrigue.  This is a more political style of story rather than previous series which have been more military or overlord centered stories.  Even Gundam Seed featured a moral rift causing war and racism but had a couple of key megalomaniacal characters that could obviously be pointed out as the bad guys.  In this series, things are a bit more ambiguous.

The first season is more about setting the table and then dishing out some great action, but the real entree is to be served in season two.

Pros:
+ Great Japanese voice acting (as expected in a Gundam series)
+ More modern character designs and appearances
+ High quality animation and backgrounds
+ Terrific musical score
+ Interesting and oddly foreseeable future
+ Rarely does it bore the viewer or settle on one scene for too long
+ $30 for 25 episodes of great Gundam action!

Cons:
- Too many principal characters and too many introduced too quickly
- Some side stories and back stories detract from overall flow
- Each character less developed than characters in previous Gundam series",1333584000,25,3655,4.746434231378764
3791874,3,B001TKK3I4,"Gundam 00 is decent.  Does not hold up to the classics like 0083 Stardust Memory or the MS 08th team.  This series has a little bit of everything for everyone.  The video quality is terrible compared to older releases.  Bandai North America is falling from Grace.  I'm glad to see them leaving the industry, as there current products are extremely sub standard compared to what they put out a few years ago.  It really is sad to see considering that they have the licenses for some of the greatest recent anime shows.  Hopefully someone can put out a Gurren lagann and a code geass Blu ray set when Bandai completely steps out of the American Anime industry.
Reccomend the product only for the story, and nothing else.  If your looking for anything fancy it's not here.  The packaging is plain and bland, and there are hardly any extras.",1332720000,,837,4.601351351351352
3791875,5,B001TKK3I4,"First off, this review is coming from someone who has NOT seen any Gundam series in the past. This is the first series of Gundam that I finished, and I have to say that the experience was amazing!

Story:
There are rumors about Mobile Suit Gundam 00 taking a large resemblance from Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, but since I haven't seen any other series of Gundam, I won't compare them. Basically an organization called ""Celestial Being"" uses it's mobile suits called ""Gundam"" in attempt to rid the world of conflict through armed intervention. Though this may seem like an impossible task... it is. The story probably sounds boring, but trust me it's not. The story's theme, especially in Season 2, is so realistic it changed my life forever! There are times where the Gundams seem ""invincible"" which can upset some people, but I didn't mind.

Characters:
I LOVE the character development and how they change throughout the course of the anime. That's something I always look for in any TV show/movie, and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 surpassed it completely!!! You have a wide-range of main characters in this series. I like what they did with two of the main characters having a civilized/normal-person point of view that isn't affected by the war at first, but later they will and will cause them to change dramatically. The members of Celestial Being all (Except one) have some sort of dark, depressing past which makes them determined to rid the world of war, and thus joining the anti-war group. Characters opposing Celestial Being aren't considered to be ""evil"", which is very realistic because large-scale wars are not about good vs. evil, but rather different beliefs.

Animation:
Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is just stunning when it comes to the animations. The battle scenes are beautiful and the mobile suit designs are not only original, but amazingly crafted. Gundams Dynames and Exia are just awesome when it comes to their design. The explosions in outer space are abnormally purple, (which I began to notice because of a friend) which does kind of bother me, but that's just a minor thing (Then again, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED's explosions are pink... Why? I don't know).

Music/Sound and Voice-acting:
Let's talk about the openings real quick. L'Arc en Ceil starts the series with ""Daybreak's Bell"", which if you look at the lyrics translated in English, you will notice how relevant the song is to the series. Season 2 is started with UVERworld's hit ""Hakanaku mo Towa no Kanashi"", again, the song's lyrics are relevant, but it's such a good song to listen to because of how upbeat it is. The music for the anime itself is really good and it fits in perfectly with everything that's going on. No complaints.

I didn't notice anything unusual with the sound, so again, no complaints... I watched Mobile Suit Gundam 00 in the English dub for personal reasons, and I have to say that the voices were top notch. I didn't notice any problems other than the first couple episodes. Setsuna's voice actor did an amazing performance and same with the voice of Nena Trinity. Once again, no complaints.

Verdict:
Mobile Suit Gundam 00 left an impact on me that will last the rest of my life. This is basically the Gundam series that got me into Gundam, so I absolutely recommend this to those who are just getting a feel for Gundam and don't know where to start. Your eyes will love you as Gundam 00 delivers amazing graphics and animation. I loved the mobile suits so much that I decided to get my first Gunpla! English voice acting is top notch, and music is great. What more can I say? I love this anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, please give it a chance!

Story: 4/5
Characters: 5/5
Animation: 5/5
Music: 4.5/5
Voice-acting (English): 4/5

Overall: 9/10

NOTE: In the future, when I start to watch some older Gundam, I'll edit this review so it will be like a ""New-comer Gundam fan"" to ""Gundam fan"" I don't know, something like that.",1331337600,13,3933,4.738304093567251
3791876,5,B001TKK3I4,"Gundam 00 is a different take on Gundam Wing. The series is fun to watch. The English voices go well with the characters; the only one I had a problem was with the annonucer giving a preview of the next episode did not match the announce from the original gundam series that aired on cartoon network back in 2000, that voice was right on it made wanna watch the next episode. This series is a good buy since the series is now in two vlolumes which is cheaper than buying each individual disc.",1330560000,3,492,4.301075268817204
