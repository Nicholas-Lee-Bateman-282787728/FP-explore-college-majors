3030047,3,B000YJH226,This was okay. Some of the signs were regional. The review was weak. The words could have been repeated slower for clarity. The categorizations were good.,1358553600,6,154,4.961538461538462

Volume 1 and 2 offer an understandable presentation of Actions & Verbs, Clothes, Food & Drink, Cities and States, people and professions, and much much more. I think the Interactive Vocabulary Quiz is great. Buy these DVD's and you won't regret it!",1346803200,9,279,4.833333333333333
3030049,5,B000YJH226,"On March 27th I placed an order on-line for 3 ASL DVD's.  They were promoting 25% OFF the entire purchase so instead of purchasing just 1 CD I splurged and purchased 3 CD's.  However, when checking out I didn't activate the discount properly. Realizing my mistake, I immediately contacted Customer Service and requested thier assistance in helping me with a refund.  At first I thought of voiding the entire transaction BUT I really WANTED these CD's so instead I turned to their Customer Service Department via e-mail. After chastizing myself for making such a stupid mistake, I chalked my ""human error"" up to a learning experience and figured I would just forget about the lost money and enjoy the CD's when they arrived BUT in less than 24 hours I received an e-mail back explaining they had reversed the charges and DID refund me the money due me!!  I was very surprised and extremely pleased that they took me seriously and had listened to my request!!  $9.48 might not sound like a lot to you BUT it made a world of difference to me!!

My students viewed it once, however they weren't interested in viewing it more than once unlike the video Sign A-Lot, which they loved!

educational information about animals of all kinds...my favorite was the rescue of the giant male sea lion, Goliath. Kudos to the Marine Mammal Rescue Team at the California Wildlife Center in Malibu, Ca. Keep up the good work!
Avery and Gilda do a wonderful job with teaching kids as well as adults the importance of respecting and caring for wildlife and all other animals and they do it in a fun and enjoyable way.
Great job! I can't wait for the release of their other DVD's.",1197504000,3,549,4.555555555555555

8233066,2,B000YJH226,"I thought there would be learning words and then using them in sentences, but it just flys through the words.  Here is the word with sign, next, next, next.  Good if that is what you are looking for though!",1393027200,2,206,4.256410256410256
8233067,5,B000YJH226,"Came across this series in a sign language class I went to at church. My daughter has unilateral deafness, and while she can hear and speak, she has always been interested in deaf culture. She was not taught sign as a young child because they wanted her to use her hearing and focus on being a hearing child. Now as a teenager she is choosing to learn more about deaf culture and is very interested in learning to sign fluently. I bought her this DVD and several others in the series, so that we can all learn together at home.",1392854400,3,527,4.28
8233068,2,B000YJH226,The video moves to fast for the children to see the movements and repeat it. Then it was very boring.,1376006400,2,101,4.1
8233069,2,B000YJH226,"I am new to ASL, so I wasn't really sure what I was getting into nor where I am supposed to start. Since I seem to learn more from what I see, I thought these dvds would be right. I got the whole set of these DVDs. Great concept but the DVDs are poorly produced. The teacher is so overly exposed that I can't see at times if one hand goes in front or behind the other. Besides, each word is introduced only once at only one speed. The camera is fixed, so you don't have any other angle to see how to form your hands.

I also think that the list of words in each category is a bit strange (under the section called ""clothing"" there is rollerskating but not shirt; under ""Food and drinks"" there is sushi but not bread).

Considering that there are a lot of asl dictionary on line and for free, I really can't recommend this to anyone. Sorry. This dvd got 2 stars because at the end there is a nice exercise/game that helps the viewer to recognize the correct sign over a list of words.",1369180800,11,983,4.114583333333333
8233070,5,B000YJH226,Like this training dvds very much. I am unable to complete them at this time but consider them fun learning. I did complete vol. 1 and it was fun and easy.,1364947200,,155,4.032258064516129
8233071,5,B000YJH226,"Deaf culture is on the incline. If you want to learn a language, and want it to be easy to do, then this is your best and closest bet. I've been speaking american sign since I was a baby, and now I have this to help me teach my future family.",1364428800,2,242,3.764705882352941
8233072,5,B000YJH226,It's great to have this on hand to watch at my convenience! I have watched it several times and it has been very helpful as a supplement to my classes!,1362441600,2,151,4.066666666666666
8233073,1,B000YJH226,"The video seemed to be either filmed in too much light or a [copy of] a copy. Signer has a bleached-out effect and signs are often difficult to read.

The signer signed at ""everyday"" speed. Too fast for teaching & there was no review or slow signing to learn from.

I watched 3/4 of first ""lesson"" and it was so poor [quality], I gave up.",1362096000,9,338,4.184615384615385
