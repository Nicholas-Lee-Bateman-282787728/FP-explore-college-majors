4709999,4,B005IUIY3W,"""I don't want your money, you got a car don't you...drive"" Lorraine (Bello) is having a rough time. Her husband left her with her young son and she has no money. Her night begins with group therapy, then she spends the rest of the money she has on Bagel Bites and gas. It gets worse when Roy (Dorff) comes into her life. He wants a ride, and has a gun to make sure he gets one. Lorraine and her son are now forced to help him. This is a movie that could easily have been a cheesy TV drama. The fact that Bello & Dorff are the actors helps make it into a more tense and exciting thriller. This is the kind of movie that has you hooked 5 minutes in and you are tense and on the edge of your seat the entire time. Stuck between doing what you would think you would do, and what you should do keeps you thinking and engrossed the entire time. Nothing really amazing here, but one of the most tense and exciting thrillers I have seen in a while. Overall, a very good movie that won't disappoint and is very much worth watching. I give it a B+.

4710000,1,B005IUIY3W,"Before I write this review I take full responsibility for watching this film. It's my fault and I deserve what I got. I have always loved Stephen Dorff and he is like a bad drug I can't kick. With every release he makes his movies get worse and I KNOW this yet I keep giving them a try.

So I'm to blame for watching Carjacked. It's not even like I expect Stephen's movies to be good now. The last twenty have been terrible so I lost expectations back when he made Steal AKA Riders.

Sigh. What can I say about this movie? Okay, it's bad. Which I am sure we all know. It's not as bad as some of Stephen's movies but that's not a compliment seeing how awful some of his movies have been.

There are tons of problems with Carjacked. It's boring, it's predictable, it's slow, it's pathetic and I could go on forever.

SPOILER ALERT!

Roy (Dorff) carjacks Lorraine (Maria Bella, who I liked before seeing her in this and now I will run from her movies from now on) and her son Chad at a gas station. They spend the first hour of the movie bonding like they are on an inspirational field trip. At one time I expected them to start singing Kumbaya. A movie like this is supposed to be a thriller but it's hard to be on edge when the main character is chatting it up with her kidnapper like they're in Hawaii.

Lorraine never tried to get away until almost the end of the film. The direction was horrible but the character development was shameful. That's what I absolutely could not forgive.

At the beginning, Roy acts like Lorraine's best friend. He even seems compassionate about her ex-husband and the life she's led. Roy even takes to Chad. I mean it's obvious that he cares. But after the first hour it's like the writers went, ""Oh yeah, he's supposed to be a bad guy."" So we get this huge switch concerning Roy just at the spur of the moment. One minute he's opening up to Lorraine about his background and the next he's stuffing her into the hood of a car and burning her alive. It didn't make any sense.

This is a bad, bad movie. I am going to vow not to watch another Stephen Dorff picture again and I suggest you do the same for your sanity if not anyone else's.

I keep hoping that things will get better but Dorff has gone down the drain of D-movie status and looks like there's no possible chance of rescuing him.

Sad. Sad. Sad.

In the famous words of Deacon Frost, ""What a waste.""",1341360000,4,2392,4.269911504424779
4710001,5,B005IUIY3W,I think the movie CarJacked is exciting and intense and the Actors Maria Bello & Stephen Dorff are wonderful. I really like this movie because it is full of intense action! I think you would really enjoy this movie because it will keep you at the edge of your seat. I hope you like it as much as I did.,1341360000,,302,4.05
4710002,3,B005IUIY3W,"Maria Bello is Lorraine Burton, a woman who has a lot on her mind, primarily an ex-husband who is trying to get custody of her young son Chad (Connor Hill).  While stopped at a convenience store, she returns to her car to find Roy (Stephen Dorff), a bank robber on the run, in the back seat with a gun.  Thus begins a strange journey, as Roy is bound for a rendezvous with his partner, several hours drive away.

Watching Carjacked is a strange experience that is disassociated from reality.  Lorraine doesn't seem to be very seriously concerned about the safety of her son, engaging in some really strange conversations with her captor.  She doesn't appear to be trying to trick or distract Roy, but seems to be generally engaged, as the writers seem to be enamored with displaying their talents for dialog.  Lorraine is portrayed as someone who isn't the clearest thinker, as she mistakenly dials 411 instead of 911, when she has a brief opportunity to be alone.  Like his mother, Chad doesn't seem to be the brightest kid, and displays little fear as well.

For a supposedly desperate man, Roy is one talkative kidnapper, and seemingly very interested in playing with Lorraine's head.  After clearing a police roadblock, there would seem to be better and faster ways for him to get to his destination, but he still sticks with Lorraine and her clunker of a car.  Only after Lorraine figures out a way to get her son out of danger, do things turn very nasty, and the film becomes something of a roller coaster.  After Lorraine miraculously manages to avoid being incinerated, she sees Roy kidnapping a mother and daughter, and goes into action hero mode for what is one insane and extreme finish.

With quirky characters who seem to be living in an alternate reality, Carjacked is an entertaining, but strange disjointed ride.  Written by a husband and wife team collaborating on their first film, the story isn't very credible, but has the kind of over the top finish that Hollywood seems to favor.  Maria Bello (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback/dp/B00000JDIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-History-of-Violence/dp/B000E1126G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A History of Violence</a>) and Stephen Dorff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortals/dp/B004LWZW8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortals</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>) both do a nice job of delivering exactly the kind of performances that the screenplay calls for, however you may need to be in a very undemanding frame of mind to really enjoy this movie, which stretches reality severely, while putting a warped spin on empowerment.",1336262400,,2854,5.84578313253012
4710003,3,B005IUIY3W,"Lorraine (Maria Bello of Prime Suspect) is having a bad year. Her husband, Gary, has left her, filed for divorce and full custody of her son, Chad.
When we join Lorraine she's in a women's group therapy session where other participants accuse her of being ""too nice"" and a doormat.
She picks up Chad, stops by a convenience store for frozen pizza, and cigarettes (but she's trying to quit). She comes back to the car, realizes she's about out of gas, so gives the clerk the last six dollars she has.
She pumps the gas, gets in the car and is introduced to Roy (Stephen Dorff). Roy's in the back seat with a gun. He's robbed a bank. The police have set up roadblocks. He's got to get out of town, meet up with his partner and split the money.
Lorraine and Chad are his way out.
As the viewer you are constantly second guessing what Lorraine should do.
We're thrown off by Roy's personality. At times, he becomes a fatherly figure to Chad and even hints he'd be interested in becoming a part of their family. But that's when he buys into the idea that Lorraine is that ""doormat"" but over the course of their travels she's transforming into a survivor.
It's the acting by Maria and Stephen that hold this cross country carjacking thriller together.
The movie is more realistic at the beginning. By the end, it morphos into a more cookie cutter thriller with car chases, bullet wounds, fireballs and bags of hundred dollar bills.",1331683200,,1425,4.5271317829457365
4710004,4,B005IUIY3W,I enjoyed this movie but one thing in the story bothered me. Maria Bello seemed too friendly with her carjacker. Otherwise it was good.,1326499200,,135,4.666666666666667
4710005,4,B005IUIY3W,"I liked this movie.

While much of the criticism of other reviewers is accurate, I don't think the movie deserves some of the harsh judgemental comments.  There were some unexpected (admittedly unlikely or unrealistic) twists that kept the energy going throughout the film.  The weirdest thing to me was when Lorraine reached the diner after escaping from Roy and did not ask for help or call 911, but it proved to be a necessary part of the plot.

There were other contrived momments, but hey, this is supposed to be entertainment, not a documentary, and is certainly no more ridiculous than some of the big blockbusters (eg. Titanic).  This movie will not win any awards, but I found it to be very entertaining and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films (which, less face it, are traditionally riddled with ridiculous dialogue and plot devices).",1324857600,4,861,4.86986301369863
4710006,2,B005IUIY3W,"The movie started out pretty good and then towards the end it just got silly and farfetched to the point where we were laughing.  The quality of acting also went the same way, started really good and then was a little less believable as time went on...maybe the actors even knew what they were acting out was silly material at that point.",1322265600,,338,4.451612903225806
4710007,3,B005IUIY3W,"This is a nice fantasy thriller with the banter between the carjacker and carjacked mom (Bello) soooo unbelievable---definitely not what you'd expect between a supposedly scared out of her mind victim and deadly criminal.  It's almost as if they're long-time friends or maybe ex-lovers.  Bello plays somewhat of a weak, apologetic dimwit---quite the opposite of her tough as nails Jane Timoney character on Prime Suspect.  You keep waiting for Jane to show up and save the day, and when she finally does toward the end of the movie, the tables turn.  The victim becomes the deadly perpetrator and the bad guy becomes the victim--and that, boys and girls, is where this movie really gets even more all fantasy and crazy.",1322092800,,719,4.966666666666667
4710008,1,B005IUIY3W,"Poorly written as follows:
(a.) Kidnapping of viewing/paying public by a movie that consists of 95% ridiculous monologue between kidnapper and mom with kid riding in a car which sounded more like the inane imaginations of a really cheap paperback book.
(b.) Not believable mom who is totally incompetent and then suddenly is handling a shotgun and two pistols like a trained weapons expert.
(c.) Cell and other phone calls that either don't get a clear signal (P.S. There actually is a website that lists all the movies where phone connections always seem to fail at the critical moment.) or the people (e.g. police, phone operators) are really dumb a...
(d.) Mom rolls and totals out pickup she stole and without a seatbelt gets out and walks away like nothing's happened.
(e.) Towards the end mom doesn't help shot police officer and instead steals the bank loot.
(f.) At the end mom gets custody of son in what seemed like an afternoon made for TV courtroom. Her behavior in these final two scenes made me change to rooting for the carjacker.

Acting, directing, etc:
(a.) Acting was almost comical knowing that it's a mom and her son riding with a carjacker and everybody is acting like it's an afternoon drive to the market. The behaviors were totally unrealistic.
(b.) Directing was mostly run of the mill attach a camera to the car or car dolly and just film head shots for the whole movie.
(c.) Director forgot to keep track of bullets and guns because even when empty they found new life and people were also pulling new guns out of thin air.",1322006400,2,1551,4.681318681318682
4710009,2,B005IUIY3W,"Maria Bello stars as Lorraine, a divorced mother who has trouble coping with life. She is unable to take charge of her life and blames herself for every misfortune that comes her way. While spending her last dollar at a convenience store on pizza bagels for her and her son, she gets carjacked by Roy, (Stephen Dorff) a somewhat understanding, yet terrifying bank robber who gets along great with her son Chad, who BTW needs a father figure. The movie takes you to a point where it can go a number of different ways and downhill would not have been my first choice, but that is how it went.

Good acting, although Mario Bello becomes less convincing as the plot turns unrealistic.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1321142400,3,708,4.566929133858268

8475034,4,B005IUIY3W,"I read a lot of the reviews about this movie and was surprised to see people knocking maria bello. I feel she is a very good actress and still like her. Sephen dorff, well thats another story. Why on earth does he always play the same character in every movie?  And i don't mean that he always plays the same kind of characters. I mean the exact same character. Does he really have only one method of acting or what? Its really sad he never thinks outside of the box and plays a different character. Maybe thats why he keeps getting these roles, because at least directors know what they are getting. Now Maria Bello I  really like. She wasn't bad in this move but working with Stephen Dorff i can see why people look a little down in her. But for those who think they have lost faith in maria bello, just watch Big Driver, and all faith will be restored. That being said i cant say i did enjoy this movie i really did like it. But like most people I am really sick of seeing a move with Stephen Dorff in it and you already know how the movie will play out. No surprises at all",1476748800,,1077,4.148325358851674

8475037,2,B005IUIY3W,"Being the understanding, affable, amiable, bank-robber he is, Stephen Dorff cuts his hostage, Maria Bello, some slack. Slack, unfortunately, also describes the tension in this film. The acting is of a high enough standard in the beginning, but the script is, at best, mediocre, and by the end of the film, the two leads are just turning in their performances by post.",1461369600,,367,4.935483870967742

8475040,3,B005IUIY3W,"This movie is actually pretty descent.  It's not the best, but definitely not the worst for a movie that went straight to DVD.  I would recommend this movie if nothing else is on.  It sure passed the time and kept me entertained wondering what was going to happen even though it's predictable.",1409616000,,293,4.596153846153846
