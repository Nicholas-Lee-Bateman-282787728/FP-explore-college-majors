5170588,3,B008NNSCJ2,"You likely already want these, so I'll cover the key points regarding the remastering job they present you with then you can decide.
The first film is clearly not from the original elements. It looks very poor - like it was processed through way to much noise reduction (and the audio as well).
There is very little detail in the image & the audio is very muffled. This is not what I call High Definition - Many upconverted regular DVD's look far better than this.
The giveaway is that you can see the reel change cue marks about midway through.

The second & third films are totally done the way they should be. Even for a low budget movie, these look amazing in terms of detail & color balance + the sound is much clearer. These will be like seeing them for the first time.

It's too bad they did such a shoddy job on the first one - it borders on fraud to be honest. Full Moon really should offer free replacements of this movie.
I'd give the set 5 stars if it looked as good as the other 2.
Let price be the deciding factor if you purchase this set.",1363392000,9,1053,4.207920792079208
5170589,5,B008NNSCJ2,"Don't be fooled! These aren't hoity toity full screen reissues, these are the releases a Puppet Master/Full Moon fan has been waiting for! This 3-pack for both formats includes the first 3 films in the series (1 and 3 are my favorites in this pack) and have been digitally remastered in high definition! No more having to buy the shoddy full screen releases, no more having to look at the awful DVD transfer of Puppet Master II, you are getting what you always wanted; restored and remastered HD transfers, in widescreen, with 5.1 sound, and extras! Infact, Charles Band has informed us that the Puppet Master disc in the 3-pack will be all new with extras (so sooner or later, retire your old disc)! So buy this set today and get ready for the next upcoming chapter in the Puppet Master series Puppet Master X: Axis Rising (though XI if you count Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys)! And from what I understand, more Full Moon flicks will be remastered so stay tuned!",1343001600,9,964,4.6104651162790695

5170593,1,B008NNSCJ2,Don't buy these movies. DON'T. BUY. THEM. I regret every single second of my life after wasting my time with this crap. This is the most boring thing I have ever seen and I sit through things other people would never even consider entertaining!

5170594,5,B008NNSCJ2,1-3 Amazing just wish there was four and five on blu ray >.< Otherwise a good buy for the price.,1387238400,,96,3.85
5170595,4,B008NNSCJ2,This loses a star because the first film is the poorest one when it comes to the conversion!  I mean basically most of us really want that to be the best one because it is the original but it had tons of fragments and noise on it.  The other two movies are glorious looking and very well done.  You will find some fun things like an old ad for the toys which was hilarious and some other extras which make this a great purchase for us fans wanting to upgrade to blu ray for our puppet masters.  Of course it takes a special kind of person to enjoy these films as much as I do along with the dolls.  The tall man will still be my all time favorite but the puppets are a close second.,1381363200,4,682,3.985294117647059

5170597,5,B008NNSCJ2,"I won't spend time reviewing each film, but rather the quality of the blu rays themselves.  Full Moon has done it's fans a great service by finally releasing these on Blu Ray.  The first 3 films are really classics in the genre and this is the first time we're getting to see them in their intended form.  These films were first released on VHS in the late 80's/early 90's before widescreen presentations were common place in the home video market.  We were forced to see full frame versions.  Those transfers carried over to DVDs.  If you were unlucky enough to pick up any dvd releases from Echo Bridge Entertainment of the first 6 films on DVD, you saw some pretty awful transfers.  Now we are treated to beautiful 1.85:1 transfers with brand new color timing that makes the films look brand new.  The only issues would be that there is some banding in the blacks every once in awhile and the menu volume is louder than the feature volume.  To be clear, the feature volume is perfectly fine, it's the menus that are cartoonishly loud.  Each disc includes the original Videozone from back in the day, as well.  If you're a fan of the series, or just a fan of indie horror, this is a must own.",1373328000,5,1194,4.456221198156682

If you know Full Moon and The Puppet Master series at all then you know you're in for B grade awesomeness, and the first 3 are still the best hands down. This bluray set is fantastic at an affordable price. If you've been disappointed with the terrible VHS and Laserdisc dvd transfers, then it is now time to rejoice. Full Moon's new remastered bluray renditions are exactly what you've been looking for.

8529144,4,B008NNSCJ2,"Full Moon Features are a big part of my horror upbringing. I would say they were my first exposure to direct-to-video movies. I remember going to the local video store and grabbing up every ""Subspecies,"" ""Trancers,"" ""Robot Jox,"" and ""Dollman"" release I could get my hands on. I never thought I'd see the day where these B-movie gems would get a high-definition transfer. That dream came true as I sat down to enjoy the ""Puppet Master 3 Disc Blu-ray Slimline Set.""

The collection includes ""Puppet Master,"" Puppet Master II,"" and ""Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge."" In the original, Neil Gallagher (Jimmie F. Skaggs) found the secret to Toulon's (William Hickey) puppets who come to life and then killed himself. Alex (Paul Le Mat) and his psychic friends come to investigate and are stalked by Toulon's puppets who have a variety of strange traits including a drill for a head and the ability to spit up leeches.

In ""Puppet Master II,"" the evil puppets dig up their creator, Toulon (Steve Welles), and bring him back to life. They need the mad puppeteer to concoct more of his formula to keep them alive. Thanks to a new group of paranormal investigators visiting the Bodega Bay Inn, the diabolical little creatures have a fresh supply of humans to use for the ingredients. Complications arise when Toulon becomes mesmerized by the leader of the group who resembles his late wife, Elsa (Elizabeth Maclellan).

""Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge"" takes the series in an exciting new direction. In 1941, a doctor named Hess (Ian Abercrombie) is attempting to produce a serum that will re-animate dead soldiers to march on the frontline and give cover for the live ones in battle. He hears about a puppeteer named Toulon (Guy Rolfe) who uses stringless puppets in his performances. Upon investigating, Hess discovers Toulon has generated a potion that brings inanimate objects to life. Toulon's wife (Sarah Douglas) is killed by the Nazis and the puppeteer uses his wooden creations to exact revenge on those responsible for her death.

The ""Puppet Master 3 Disc Blu-ray Slimline Set's"" high-definition transfers give the films a new lease on life. It's safe to say the movies never looked this good. Charles Band admits that himself in the introduction of the films included on the discs. The coloring is beautiful and there's no softness to the picture. Everything looks sharp and clean. It's nice to see these get the facelift they deserve as essential pieces of B-movie horror history.

The movies get 5.1 surround sound upgrades from their original versions. Richard Band's scores accentuate the dark fairy tale atmospheres of the films and feel fuller. All the sound effects, dialogue, and horrific shrills are given more room to breathe. Fans of these films will hear portions of the audio they won't remember from the original video and DVD releases because of the improvements made here.

You can see the care and love executive producer / creator Charles Band put into transferring these films for Blu-ray. He makes sure the B-movie tone isn't lost while cleaning up the picture and correcting coloring issues. It's safe to say you've never viewed the ""Puppet Master"" movies the way you will in their high-definition versions.

""Puppet Master"" comes with a Special Introduction by Charles Band, a Promo for ""Puppet Master: Axis of Evil,"" ""No Strings Attached"" Original ""Making of"" from the first ""Puppet Master,"" and original Trailers for the First 12 Full Moon Features.

Special features for ""Puppet Master II"" include an introduction from the set of the new ""Puppet Master"" movie by Charles Band. He also provides commentary for the film. The original full length ""VideoZone"" with the making of ""Puppet Master II"" is here as well. There's also a montage of the killing scenes, a rare 1997 commercial for ""Puppet Master"" action figures, and Full Moon trailers to enjoy.

""Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge"" is loaded with entertaining extras as well. The same special introduction from ""Puppet Master II"" is included with audio commentary by Director David DeCoteau and Writer C. Courtney Joyner. An original full length VideoZone featuring the making of ""Puppet Master III"" is paired with a montage of killing scenes from the film and a rare 1997 ""Puppet Master"" action figure commercial. There's also Full Moon trailers contained within.

The ""Puppet Master 3 Disc Blu-ray Slimline Set"" gives new and old viewers alike the chance to see the films the way they were intended to be. Although they're cleaned up, they don't lose any of their B-movie swaggers. They're classic creature features that will give you a fear of dolls and puppets if you don't already have one. A combination of entertaining features and great bonus material makes this a must-own release for every B-movie horror enthusiast.",1423440000,2,4818,5.041457286432161
