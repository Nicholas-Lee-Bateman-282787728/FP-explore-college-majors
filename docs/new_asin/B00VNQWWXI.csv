7100374,5,B00VNQWWXI,The best show on Math ever!  My daughter love it the most.  She was able to get her 6th grade teacher to show it in her class and made a test that the students would answer.,1436400000,14,173,3.7777777777777777
7100375,5,B00VNQWWXI,"This Nova episode debates the viewpoint of just how important math is to the universe; not just whether it is useful for calculating how things might work, but whether or not the universe itself is made up of numbers and equations and is nothing but mathematics, and our belief that we are in a real universe that is different is just an illusion.

Why would anyone think such a thing when the world seems so real, looks and feels so real, when we can't even get computers and math and equations to predict the weather a few days (sometimes hours!) in advance?

It is a bold step, this belief, but it does have some basis in reality, if not enough to prove the case.  In the history of science there have been quite a number of things that were predicted by just playing with the numbers and the physical quantities that make up our world.

A simple example:  we buy a new car and wonder what kind of mileage it will get.  We fill the gas tank, drive it for a few days or a week, fill it up again and then divide the number of miles by the number of gallons:  we get the mileage.  But it's not just the numbers that count, it's the physical quantities ""miles"" and ""gallons"" that have to be taken into account.  That doesn't seem so obvious here with such a simple example.  But take the example of Einstein discovering that energy is related to mass by the speed of light squared:  he wasn't working on energy or mass, he was working on relativity and, when he swapped around some of the various physical quantities, the equation fell out of the mix.  (Not a great explanation, I'm afraid, but an online search of ""mass energy equivalence derivation"" will get a better one for those interested).

Most of modern physics depends on advanced mathematics:  subatomic particles are predicted mathematically before being discovered experimentally and even then you can't see them, just their effects, as predicted by the equations.

And it's not just physics:  they show some examples from the world of biology that somehow follow mathematical formulae.

Then Nova gives some examples of where math seems to be less powerful:  weather forecasting, the behavior of the stock market and economics, and people's behavior in general.  Predicting the future is easy for some things, not so much for many others.

In all it's a nicely rounded program with many examples (mostly different from those I've mentioned here) and really gets you thinking.  It is a bold step to claim that the entire cosmos is really just numbers and equations, well beyond what can be proved.  But, in the spirit of nothing ventured, nothing gained, I'm glad that people like Max Tegmark and Mario Livio are exploring it and others, like Stephen Wolfram are on the other side.  It's one of those debates that promises to go on for a long, long time and I'll be interested to see where it takes us along the way.",1430265600,32,2878,4.611001964636542
7100376,5,B00VNQWWXI,"100+ YEARS AGO:
20 year old Guglielmo Marconi started sending radio signals across the Atlantic and he was credited saving many lives when the Titanic sank in 1912 since signals were transmitted by his equipments.

155 YEARS AGO;
In 1860, James Maxwell published a set of equations that explained how electricity and magnetism were related. Maxwell figured how each could generate the other and together could produce wave of energy that would travel through space at the speed of light which these days we know it as electromagnetic waves, the X-ray.

500 YEARS AGO;
Iin late 1500, Greek philosopher Aristotle thought that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones till challenged by Italian mathematician, Galileo Galilei.

700 YEARS AGO;
In late 1300, Fibonacci came up with Fibonacci sequence of 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 which works with all those daisies.

Either consider mathematics as an imperfect tool of human inventions OR a discovered part of the universe OR the truth of nature or the reasonable ineffectiveness; I will be counting the petal of every single daisy that I will be planting tomorrow and the rest of my life.

It was mostly an excellent look at the complexity and often overlooked aspect of how math, in theory can shape and influence the world around use, but it also had portions that were a little odd.

7100400,5,B00VNQWWXI,"I first saw this program on pay TV and was so fascinated that I felt I would benefit even further by having the DVD so I could re-watch it and so pick up on points I had missed - there was just so much of interest in it about the nature of our universe and how the laws of nature affect our very day lives. Anyone interested in what goes on around us, unseen but affecting us all, should see this program. Although the laws of the universe are profound the program is presented in such a way as to be within the grasp of the lay person.

As well as describing how the universal physical laws constantly are affecting all our lives, the program also examines the historical aspects of how these laws were discovered, e.g. Galileo's discovery of gravity and Newton's discovery of the laws of motion (e.g. acceleration). The presenter even demonstrates, using the same methods as used by the discoverers, how these breakthroughs were achieved. It was then demonstrated how these laws control everything that we do.

We learn that these laws are constant throughout the entire universe. We lean that all universal bodies create gravity but at different strengths and this is what keeps the stars and planets ""in place"". We also learn that these laws can all be 'reduced' to a mathematical formula, e.g. the circumference of a circle is calculated by the formula 2r. We are told that recently a previously undiscovered star was identified by using gravitational formulae in connection with a planet that was being pulled away from its gravitational rotation around a its star by a stronger gravitational pull from another, unsighted and previously unknown star. Th whereabouts and size of this 'new' star was then calculated by gravitational formula and subsequently physically sighted.

The ""mystery"" part of the program is whether the universal mathematical formulae existed before the ""big Bang"" and in some way was the force behind everything and we are now discovering those formulae or whether man has invented the various formulae and applied them to the laws of nature. In other words, have these laws existed for all time or do they originate in the human brain. Apparently the jury is still out on this.

I hope I've been able in my layman's way to shed some light on the subject matter of this Nova DVD but, whether or no this is so, I can assure others that the subject matter is brilliantly dealt with in the program and is eminently suitable for the lay person.",1457395200,13,2470,4.7372093023255815
7100401,4,B00VNQWWXI,Very good,1455062400,,9,4.0
7100402,5,B00VNQWWXI,Another great show from PBS!,1453507200,,28,4.8
7100403,4,B00VNQWWXI,Interesting and Informative.,1451952000,,28,8.666666666666666
7100404,5,B00VNQWWXI,"This program explores the idea that math is more than a language or tool for the scientist or an art or game for the mathematician, but, in itself, expresses a science, i.e. that axioms, definitions, theorems and proofs are not just logical and artistic creations, but are also discoveries about the world.  This is a bit subtle, because the ancient Pythagoreans and Plato saw math not simply as a science of the natural world, but of an ideal world, inaccessible to the senses but not the intellect.  Much of the choice of topics in the program were very elementary, directed more toward children than the educated adult.  It is interesting that computation was not much discussed.  However, the potential for turning mathematics into a science, even if it is not that now, has certainly grown exponentially with the consequences of the computer revolution.  Although this was not discussed, the film is nonetheless of very broad scope.  The mystery of the nature of mathematics is a deep one, and it is important to be aware of it.  Therefore, I recommend this film, not just for children, but for others who perhaps are interested in math, but are not themselves mathematicians or scientists.  Even I, as someone who is fairly knowledgeable about this mystery, found the show visually interesting, even if much of it was reviewing ideas with which I am already quite familiar.",1451260800,,1379,4.913793103448276
7100405,5,B00VNQWWXI,NOVA usually delivers extremely well created and executed programs on science and this was one of the most interesting and intriguing that I viewed.  It concerns itself with the philsophical question of whether math is a wrapped up in the universe or only exists in our heads.  It's not an easy answer.  It's a fascinating show that will have you wondering about the nature and power of mathematics long after you watch it.,1447718400,,423,4.767123287671233
7100406,5,B00VNQWWXI,"The problem of ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics"" has puzzled the west since Pythorgas. This video provides an excellent presentation of this enigma.

Explains the facinating insights of math, such as Fibonacci numbers, Maxwell's prediction of radio (found by Marconi), atomic physics -quarks, leptons, etc. Why does all this 'stuff' obey incredibly complex mathematics? Yes, but really, Why?

Newton's gravity - a mathematical formula - precisely explains all known motion, everything on earth to anything in the universe. How is that possible? If these are mathematical laws, who is the lawgiver?

Are humans creating mathematics in their head and imposing it on reality? Was mathematics used in the production of reality and we are just finding it? Or as video mentions, are both true? Human brain contains mathematical potential, and reality contains mathematical existence. Presents various mathematicians who believe math is found (Plato's opinion). They are convinced humans don't create math, it is already in existence? Who did that?

Highlights Mario Livio, astrophysicist, who penned the book ""Is God a mathematican?"" We know that Galelio, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Pascal all thought math was a way to see into the mind of God. Video shows that Aristotle who did not use math, just common sense, was wrong.

Explains Galileo's use of an inclined plane to slow down motion, enabling him to measure speed and deduce the mathematical formula. Actually shows the building of this apparatus. Uses animation to quickly reproduce Galileo's experiment. It shows his step by step reasoning. This was a key moment in western science. Very well done!

Mentions Wigner's Nobel address ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics"". (This can be found on the web. Twelve pages. Accessible to layman. Excellent!) This video does not supply the answer to the question. It just propounds the mystery and allows viewer to reach his own conclusion.

This video good for all ages. Lots of visual demonstration. Little time spent on talking heads. Planning to review with my grandson and recommend to friends. Enjoyed it.
