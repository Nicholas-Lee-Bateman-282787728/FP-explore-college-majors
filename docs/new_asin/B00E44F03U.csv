The beautiful lion cub ""star"" of the movie is the cutest thing!
I think that this is a fun movie that kids of a certain age could watch.  We used to watch Mutual of Omaha when I was a kid.
Really like the ending.
It's a Hanna-Barbera production.",1488672000,,449,4.022471910112359

8600819,5,B00E44F03U,"Made in Texas in the mid 70's. And it show what Hollywierd thinks Texas is like. Rednecks running around in pickups with guns. Too many plot holes and continuity errors to count.

I had to rate it ***** because I was in it. Otherwise I don't think I would have purchased it.",1443916800,,274,4.269230769230769
