8600279,5,B000009RKO,"Excellent video which covers the Roswell crash and the history of the  government cover-up since then. It has taped interviews with Jesse Marcel,  the Air Force intelligence officer who first viewed the Roswell debris, and  Philip Corso, the army intelligence officer who wrote 'The Day After  Roswell'. It also has interviews with Dr. Hynek and Astronaut Dr. Edgar  Mitchell, along with some great UFO footage and photos. It should prove to  anyone that UFOs are real and the government is not telling us the truth.",965865600,2,516,5.011764705882353
