8617468,5,B002UKOOAK,"This film of a family, moving to Alaska in 1960, living an isolated and independent life for years, and filming themselves and nature, is amazing, simple, and beautiful.

The scenery, nature, music, narration, and editing in this film, skillfully come together in a subtle way that creates a lasting aftereffect.  It's hard to describe.  This is a film I wish everyone could see.

I picked up this documentary by mistake at a local video rental store back in the early 1990's.  Over a decade later, I was able to track down and purchase a copy of the VHS tape.  This is not a high resolution film, but I'm grateful that the nature, life, beauty, and music of this film have now been captured digitally for future generations on DVD. The DVD video quality is similar to the VHS tape, which I suspect matches the original film.  On my player, the DVD colors are a bit red heavy compared to my tape, but it's still lovely.  The DVD offers a pictorial update of the Meader family since 1977, and a pictorial photo journal, both set to beautiful music.

Another documentary film that also spanned years that I wish everyone could see is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/People-of-the-Forest-The-Chimps-of-Gombe-VHS/dp/6304887035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">People of the Forest: The Chimps of Gombe [VHS</a>].
