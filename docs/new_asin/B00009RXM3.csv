1890251,5,B00009RXM3,"Rainbeau Mars is an excellent instructor.  Following this tape/DVD is similar to attending an actual yoga class.  She conveys warmth, and knowledge with her instructions.  I think women of any fitness level, and at any stage in their pregnancy will benefit by practicing this workout.",1069545600,4,284,5.266666666666667
1890252,1,B00009RXM3,"i like yoga and do it weekly, but i found rainbeau to be a different breed. the workout does not seem inspired by the pregnancy, it is a traditional yoga routine with very little information to help create safety and awareness for the safety of the mom and baby to be. I didn't care for this style of yoga and don't think this is a very well thought out video routine. FitMama by Leisa Hart is so much better, weird how the names are similar.",1068681600,4,442,4.211764705882353
1890253,5,B00009RXM3,"Really wonderful program by the ever powerful Natual Journeys!  I was so very pleased with this yoga series.  Great and challenging poses with modifications offered.  I felt energized and refreshed.  I also felt like all the right muscles were streched and worked.  What a difference from any other prenatal DVD I have done.  Love this session/workout.  Realistic, challenging and really enjoyable.  I wish I found it earlier in my pregnancy and vow to use it through the rest.",1067644800,24,477,5.0256410256410255
1890254,5,B00009RXM3,"I really enjoyed this video.  I am five months pregnant and haven't been very active so far in my pregnancy.  I was looking for something to help me gradually build some strength, flexibility and endurance without over-doing it and I think this is just what I need right now.
With soothing background music, Rainbeau moves from pose to pose very slowly and talks directly to you.  She stresses the importance of listening to your body and working at your own pace.  She does a great job of describing the positions and gives you lots of alternatives to suit your own needs.  Having 3 people to watch (one for each trimester) was very helpful.",1057190400,2,642,4.646017699115045
1890255,4,B00009RXM3,"I LOVED that this even had the oh-so-important kegal exercises. I found mucles I didn't know I had. The actual work out is very mild. It has a meditation session at the end. I liked it, although she seemed a little cheesey. Really centered and relaxed me though.",1331164800,,262,4.479166666666667
1890256,3,B00009RXM3,"I must not be in to yoga because I didn't care for this work out.  I found all the zen, peace, and tranquility stuff to not be my cup of tea.  I bought this and FitMama<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leisa-Hart-FitMama-Prenatal-Workout/dp/B000W1V4OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leisa Hart: FitMama - Prenatal Workout</a>&nbsp;and I much prefered the FitMama.  That one was more of an aerobic workout.  My obgyn had said yoga would be good for me but, since I had no physical limitations for the pregnancy, I prefered to sweat a bit more.",1325030400,,574,5.7976190476190474
1890257,5,B00009RXM3,"I really enjoyed doing this thru my pregancy.
Rainbeau is very pleasant and explains what she is doing and how it will positively affect pregnancy and birth.
It's not complicated and was very relaxing.",1297382400,,201,4.9411764705882355
1890258,4,B00009RXM3,"I am a huge fan of Rainbeau Mars as anyone who visits my ratings can tell. I find her style and philosophy to be amazing and enlightening. That said while I enjoy this video and can see it becoming a staple for those days when I am feeling not quite up to a rigorous workout or as I get further along in my pregnancy (only about 5.5 weeks) it is definitely not challenging enough for me. I am into intermediate yoga even doing some advanced yoga postures as well and I found that while sublimely relaxing this was not enough for me. Granted, Rainbeau is I believe 7 months pregnant in the video which may account for the more relaxed style.

I still think that this is a great video, especially if someone is not necessarily experienced in yoga or working out in general but want to start their pregnancy on a healthier foot. I personally will be using it for those days when I need to get my body moving and stretched but don't feel up to a very hard work out.

One thing that I absolutely love is that there is an inclusion of the baby into the flow of the practice, it makes you come into focus on not just why you are working out in that moment (to ensure a healthy pregnancy and de-facto a healthy baby) but also the miracle of pregnancy and conceiving and housing a child within your body. Its very affirming and very empowering!",1271376000,,1335,4.2936507936507935
1890259,4,B00009RXM3,I have not done a lot of yoga before I became pregnant but this was a very enjoyable workout.  I liked all of the variations depending on which trimester you are in and how you are feeling.  I not only could feel my body working I also felt a great stretch for my whole body which really relaxed me by the end.  I would recommend this to other pregnant women.,1243987200,2,359,4.1
1890260,4,B00009RXM3,"ZenMama with Rainbeau Mars has grown on me among my small collection of pre-natal yoga videos.  I wasn't convinced at first, and found some of the asanas more challenging than I had hoped for - however, those little challenges have worked themselves out, and it wasn't enough for me to shelve this video.  Now, it's risen to the top of my list.

Rainbeau Mars uses a variety of asanas, talks them through in a very human, compassionate way, and encourages you to welcome the challenges and breathe through them.  At first, I felt she talked too much through the video, but after awhile, I realized that it helped me build a connection to my practice.  Also, her talking through shavasana at the end really tuned me into 1) how to relax my body 2) why this is considered such a hard pose, even when it would seem so easy!

I believe this video will be a challenge for those who are not already practicing yoga, or who are new to fitness.  Her third trimester accommodations might be useful for those who are in even their first trimester, but need a bit more support through some of the asanas.  It might not be as challenging for people who are super-familiar with yoga, but I think that it hits a good happy medium, and wherever you're at, is a good video to supplement studio practice, or use twice a week (or more) at home.",1233878400,2,1326,4.450413223140496
1890261,3,B00009RXM3,"I must admit I like the actual routine in this video. But I am not sure I feel comfortable saying this is a good beginner video because the routine is easy and basic, but the instructions Rainbeau gives are not really that great and really lack technique. She doesn't name most of the poses which means you need to be watching to see what she is doing, which is a bit annoying and a problem in many poses. Her technique is a little poor, and her verbage while instructing the routine is a little off and sometimes annoying because it doesn't really flow.

If you want to be technical about how you move throughout the routine watch the girl in back with the red hair and blue leotard.

There are also parts of the workout that if you have a bad back, as I do, and have never been to a formal yoga class, you are likely to hurt your back as she does not tell you to gently roll up or give you any of the gentle instruction that allows you to save yourself the back pain when doing yoga. Just be aware.

Other than the lack of technique and formal titles for poses I think this is a good video, but not necessarily a good one if you are a true blue beginner as it does not explain enough IMO.",1229558400,3,1190,4.120689655172414
1890262,5,B00009RXM3,"This is the only prenatal yoga video I've found that I like. Let it be said, I am not the hugest yoga fan to begin with, so I am quite picky about it. I just force myself to do it bc I know it is good for me. Anyways, I don't mind doing ZenMama because it's not as corny as a lot of other vids and bc find Rainbeau Mars voice very soothing.",1209254400,2,340,3.671232876712329
1890263,4,B00009RXM3,"I really enjoy this workout. I am a little familiar with yoga, but have never practiced it before and I found it fairly easy to follow. There are a few parts that I think could have been explained a little better, but after trying it out a couple of times I found them easy to get the hang of. I really liked that Rainbeau had 2 other women with her, and that each of them was in a different spot in their pregnancy so there are different variations shown for each trimester. It wasn't like some cheesy yoga videos  I've seen before, but very calming and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this video to a friend.",1202860800,2,617,4.318965517241379
1890264,2,B00009RXM3,"I was grooving along pretty well with Rainbeau until she got to the Kegel Exercises and began referring to our vaginas as ""basements"". She was instructing us to squeeze tighter and tighter and so said ""Basement, First Floor, Second, Third..."" Maybe that's petty of me to get all torn up about that, but it really did ruin my yoga groove. If you're the kinda gal that has no problem with an analogy to a room under your house that stores spiders, plastic christmas trees, and various rusty tools... you'll probably really love this DVD. Really... other than that... it's very good. :)",1201564800,2,583,4.7254901960784315
1890265,4,B00009RXM3,"This is a video that will help one cope with stress and tension. I did not break a sweat (I'm in my 2nd trimester), but it is more to help you breathe deeply and relax. She has a personal style and does some poses that encourage bonding between baby and mother.",1190851200,3,261,4.137254901960785
1890266,5,B00009RXM3,"After working out with this video, I feel relaxed and ready to face day.  Rainbeau has a warm and caring approach that makes viewers feel great.  The workout is not very strenuous, but as I'm in my second trimester now, you get some good leg stretches and toning in.  Two other women join Rainbeau to demonstrate modifications.  Although Rainbeau is not perfect in her queuing and speech, it's easily forgivable -- none of us are perfect, right? I love the music, too.",1189123200,3,468,4.670731707317073
1890267,5,B00009RXM3,I loved this DVD while I was pregnant. She is fantastic at instructing Yoga. Not just what exersises to do but all the little details about positions and adjusting to your particular needs.,1188000000,,189,4.757575757575758
1890268,1,B00009RXM3,"This is the poorest quality prenatal yoga DVD I've purchased. I did yoga for a couple of years before I got pregnant so I can compare to some good teachers. This young woman is constantly out of breath, she rushes her talking and postures as if she is late for something. It gives a very restless rhythm to the whole work out. Also her comments about anatomical and physiological processes in woman's body are either erroneous or don't make sense. And the work out itself is not well designed and doesn't engage all groups of muscles.",1184544000,2,534,4.572916666666667
1890269,5,B00009RXM3,"I own a variety of prenatal yoga dvds and this is one of my top 3.  I have horrible sciatica in the pregnancy and nothing helps relieve the pain associated with the back of my leg, lower back as well as hip/joint pain like this dvd.  There are a lot of easy and effective front bending postures which work to take the pressures off the areas pregnancy put pressures on.  It's very easy to overstretch and hyperextend during pregnancy and this dvd does not leave room for those types of errors.  I recommend it along with Shiva Rea's and ""The Method"".  If you have sciatica your quality of life will be greatly improved by incorporating this into your prenatal lifestyle.",1182988800,,670,4.55
1890270,3,B00009RXM3,"I bought this when I was pregnant and needed a new workout. I work out on a regular basis but needed something more geared towards pregnancy. This was OK. It was easy to get through, but I wouldn't categorize as a 'good workout'. Good to have for the days you want a really low key workout while preggers!",1182211200,,305,4.275862068965517
1890271,2,B00009RXM3,"I am in my first trimester and purchased this DVD to start a simple yoga routine - to stretch and keep active - I wasn't looking for a heavy workout, just some simple and safe yoga. I have done some yoga in the past, so I'm not a total beginner to it. It is certainly a simple yoga routine, but at the end of it, I don't really feel that I've done very much or feel very well stretched. I find I have trouble following some of the instructions/understanding what I'm supposed to actually be DOING in certain moments and feel like I'm just sitting there on my hands and knees many times for some unknown reason. There are several instances where you are told to let your head hang down and - maybe this is just me - but all the blood rushes to my head resulting in a rather dizzy few seconds. Other DVDs I've used (while not pregnant) focus a lot on proper posture, and this one doesn't at all, which I found disconcerting. I was also distracted by the poor lady in her third trimester who keeps having to move her various props in and out (that chair looks heavy). The squats and kegel moments are good, but the whole thing is SO low energy and filled with awkward or uncomfortable moments that I'm not even excited to put it on.",1175212800,,1229,4.23404255319149
1890272,3,B00009RXM3,"I was doing a little yoga before my pregnancy (in preparation for the 3rd trimester, actually), so this seemed like a natural fit. Maybe... but I rarely felt inclined to watch it, must less do it. It's almost like they expected everyone to be fully prepared to throw their pregnant bodies into all kinds of positions -- not me! I WANTED to, but I wasn't prepared to. Give me a little more motivation, please! Then maybe I would have been inspired to complete these programs.",1174867200,,474,4.588235294117647
1890273,4,B00009RXM3,"This is a great video to supplement your in-studio yoga practices. She gently guides you through some great poses/positions and talks about all the adjustments that can be made as we get bigger. Personally, and only being 6 months pregnant now, I would still like something that pushes me a little bit more, but I'm sure I'll appreciate the video in full in a few weeks. For now I just pause the video and do a few more repeats of certains poses to get the workout that I want. All in all, a great video.",1174262400,3,504,4.315789473684211
1890274,1,B00009RXM3,"I don't mean to be too negative, but I found this DVD to be truly useless.  It wasn't a good workout, relaxing, very informative, or anything else worthwhile.  I really just threw my money away on this purchase.",1171670400,,211,4.526315789473684
1890275,4,B00009RXM3,"I thouroughly enjoyed this yoga practice.  Yes, it is not a dificult as some, but I was pretty lazy during my pregnancy and this was perfect for me.  Sure, there's a bit of inane, new-age chatter, but that is to be expected in any yoga video.  Overall, I thought it was fun and got me to stretch and work out some of the discomfort in my back and pelvis.  It was definitely very helpful in those areas.",1171152000,,402,4.181818181818182
1890276,4,B00009RXM3,I enjoyed the yoga journal one more than this one.  It is a little too tree hugger for me and this is from a former tree hugger,1167868800,,127,3.7037037037037037
1890277,5,B00009RXM3,"Wow, what a great workout! And I didn't feel like she was ever asking me to do something I couldn't do. Rainbeau uses herself and 2 models as different trimesters for you to follow. (Rainbeau is in her 2nd trimester.) The modifications are helpful and plentiful for whatever trimester you're in. It also feels like she's talking to you like a normal person, which makes a big difference in the feeling of the workout.

I also am so glad that the essence of true hatha yoga is used in this video. I've tried 2 others (Shiva Rea and Dr. Christine Anderson) and I just didn't feel I was getting real hatha yoga. I appreciate that she focuses on the correct breathing techniques and how important it is listen to your body. During this workout I felt like I was working, but not past my limit. I highly recommend this video!",1165881600,4,820,4.466666666666667
1890278,5,B00009RXM3,"I really, really enjoyed this workout. And while it is tailored to the pregnant woman, these exercises will continue to be useful even after birthing. I believe the stretches and postures will really help prepare my body for birthing. And I've stretched muscles I forgot I had!

There are 3 women in different stages of pregnancy, so they show you how to modify your postures according to where you are in your own pregnancy.

The postures are easy for beginners, and those with yoga experience can intesify them if needed.

Definitely two thumbs up.",1165795200,2,550,4.829787234042553
1890279,5,B00009RXM3,Best pre natal yoga! I have been doing yoga (but not advanced levels)for 5 years. I like how she talks to you while she is in the poses. Unlike others that have someone in the back ground just telling you what to do. She is upbeat and fun. I recommend to anyone that has any yoga experience!,1149206400,,291,4.12280701754386
1890280,5,B00009RXM3,"ZenMama is a great DVD.  I tried a few prenatal classes at yoga studios, but they were hard to find and started getting expensive.  ZenMama was the same price as one studio class and I can do it over and over.  She has very much the same teaching style and pace as a studio class.  Now that I'm entering trimester 3 it was amazing to feel the positions creating some much needed extra space for both me and the little one inside.",1145750400,,429,4.195121951219512
1890281,5,B00009RXM3,"I had a very difficult pregnancy and this was so helpful.  It helped with the stress & with the pain in my lower back & down my leg.  The special features with the stretch to shorten the birth canal was especially helpful.  Circumstances didn't allow me to use it in actual childbirth but it was so great during the pregnancy.  I've been doing yoga for a while but not consistently, so this was very good for someone at a moderate level.",1144195200,2,437,4.3580246913580245
1890282,5,B00009RXM3,"This is one of my favorite yoga tapes. Rainbeau has such a good spirit as she guides you through simple and effective yoga poses. Some tapes have complex poses that make a pregnant woman feel off balance, even when using a chair. Zen Mama is all about solid grounding, no chairs unless you are in your third trimester, and firm stretches.

You don't feel rushed since Rainbeau is talking while moving into the poses herself, no dubbed and overly produced cuts. She emanates a wonderful and loving environment that will make you smile as she personalizes the workout.",1142294400,,566,4.775510204081633
1890283,4,B00009RXM3,"I enjoyed practicing yoga dedicated to pregnancy.  With three on screen demonstrators in varying stages of pregnancy, you can use the video during the entire 9 months.  I feel a greater connection to my pregnancy and baby doing the ZenMama yoga and felt it was very comforting and relaxing.  But the next day, I felt the little burn in my muscles which made the poses / exercise worthwile!",1140652800,,389,4.6911764705882355
1890284,3,B00009RXM3,"As an experienced yoga student, I have been desperately seeking a prenatal yoga routine that will be challenging but safe.  This is not the one.  It is really very basic and provided very little strength work or endurance training.  It also seemed somewhat choppy.  I would do it if I had time to kill for relaxation, but not to exercise.  Any experienced yoginis out there should definitely try Dr. Christine Anderson's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga rather than this DVD.",1137715200,10,464,4.897435897435898

At first it was interesting but a little slow. Then I started having premature contractions and got put on modified bedrest. My doctor said I couldn't exercise at all but after a week of that my muscles (and my brain) got very twitchy and restless. Now I've started to do this yoga DVD again and it's gentle enough to ease my restlessness and doesn't cause any contractions.

I really notice when I have missed a session and it always makes my body feel stronger and more flexible. The instructors' soothing, confident way has reminded me of what an exciting and mirculous time pregnancy is! I tried Shiva Rea's video and did not enjoy it at all.

1890290,5,B00009RXM3,"I'm not a hardcore yogi by any means, although I have dabbled here and there.  When I bought the DVD, I was just looking for anything to help me stay limber and relaxed.  But I didn't use the DVD until I started experiencing back pain and some insomnia.  I used the DVD (before bed) and wow!  I was so relaxed and happy and I could've either stayed up or gone to bed, it didn't matter.  My back pain was gone and I knew how to breathe through it and pose through it when it came along again.

Thought Rainbeau doesn't always say the right thing (she'll tell you to take your left leg when she means your right), if you watch the DVD through once before using it, you'll know where you're supposed to be.  It's certainly not hard to get used to, and the modifications are quite helpful.  As another review on here said, Rainbeau isn't cheesy or as hippie as one may assume she'll be.  I really enjoyed her style and presence while doing my workout.  Her voice is also soothing, which is a great help.

All in all, I am going to send this DVD to several people I know who are currently pregnant.  I have to, having the results I've had!",1110067200,6,1134,4.223255813953489

I've done yoga for 7 years, so I do know what I'm doing, which maybe something to think about if you're a beginner.  Check out a local yoga studio for prenatal and do this at home.  I usually throw in some of my own challenging poses in between her instruction, but it's a good workout.  And, unless you're used to doing Ashtanga, I guess we are supposed to take it a little easier when we're pregnant.",1097884800,6,531,4.333333333333333

Thank you Rainbeau, for sharing such a full and rich time in your life with those of up going through the same thing at home...  It will definetely appeal to hip, open and probably younger enthusiastic but possibly scared moms to be.

Both workouts are good and safe to do. I found Rainbeau Mars to be sweet but not soothing or spiritual. She has a high voice and talks way too much during the workout. Shiva Rea also talks a lot but it's in a soothing low voice that's not interfering. I like my yoga to be meditative and somewhat serious. Rainbeau jokes too much and I can not take her seriously as a qualified yoga instructor. Yoga Zone Pregnancy tape is okay, though Zen Mama's workout is better.",1084752000,4,636,4.352941176470588

I am not really enjoying this video, its not as fitnessy of a yoga prego video as i'd like, it's about to be traded away.",1083542400,2,267,4.056603773584905
1890298,1,B00009RXM3,"the instructor is a yoga guru obviously, but she does not know how to instruct prenatal exercises...i did not like the workout or the style in which she attempted to soothe and settle the body...i don't think others will really like this video either, it is not very good at all",1079395200,,278,4.470588235294118
1890299,4,B00009RXM3,"I also thought this was a great yoga video, very much like a class.  The background music is soft and does not distract from the yoga practices.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because of an audio technical difficulty.  Rainbeau appears to have been dubbed or rather, her lips do not match the words you hear, even though she speaks English and the words are in English.  It is weird.  This might not bother some people, but it bothered me when I initially watched it.  It seemed to me like a timing thing.  Once you are doing the routine comfortably and look at the screen less, it might not be a problem.  Seems like it would be easy to fix, I'm emailing the company to see what the deal is.  Amazon was great about giving me a new DVD, but it did the same thing.",1078704000,5,776,4.12
1890300,4,B00009RXM3,"If you haven't done yoga before, this might be a tough workout - it's not too strenuous, but her instruction can be confusing (eg. ""Move your shoulders up... down towards your back"") and she doesn't explain the poses in-depth.  Still, it's not watered-down and has more ""true"" yoga poses, unlike some of the other options.
I do this video as part of my fitness routine, but each time I  cringe at some of the more annoying chatter - problems with grammar like ""the femur bones is the bone,"" or telling us that chest stretches along with a good oil are great for preventing stretch marks (to which my dr. said she sounds like an enthusiastic, first-time mom.)  The good news, if you have the DVD, is that if you're distracted by her instruction but want the thorough workout, you can select the video with music only.",1078531200,20,816,4.575342465753424
1890301,5,B00009RXM3,"I think that some reviewers failed to understand certain things.  It's yoga, and as such, it's not an aerobics video.  Yoga is more about strengthening and breathing techniques, whereas aerobics is about sweating and constant movement.  I love the video.  Since I've been married, I'm nowhere near a yoga studio, so I haven't had the opportunity to practice it.  To me, this was just like my old yoga studio, and I love it! I must allay any fears about the ""extended"" section on Kegels.  The section is very brief, just to inform us how to do the exercise and to advise that it can be done anywhere.  Very useful, IMHO, and very tasetfully done.",1078531200,6,645,4.605263157894737
1890302,5,B00009RXM3,"I was completely blown away by this video.... Rainbeau offers a very personal and in your livingroom way to go through a very effective yoga routine.  I am five months pregnant and found it so very thourough in technique, enjoyment and education.  This is the first video that I have found that the teacher is pregnant herself and because of this, seems to be sharing a very personal, direct experience.  I am grateful for her that she took the time to make this video as I myself can not imagine doing anything other than being pregnant right now.  THANK YOU RAINBEAU FOR THIS GIFT....  I hope that all pregnant woman will get this video and that they are moved by it as deeply as I have been.",1075161600,2,694,4.433070866141732
1890303,4,B00009RXM3,"I really like this DVD.  For once, it's a prenatal yoga workout that doesn't seem like I'm watching that old Sit To Be Fit TV workout with the old woman in the plain leotard and monotone studio droning out the exercises.
It's more like being in a yoga studio. Rainbeau Mars is instructive without being overbearing, soothing and spiritual without being hokey.  It's like she's a friend in the room with you, not too formal.
There is also a menu selection so you can do the workout with music and no talking once you get the routine down, or if you want to modify the routine.
The problem with the DVD is that sometimes Rainbeau Mars is a bit confusing or doesn't describe things as best as I think she could. If you don't normally do yoga, it might be difficult to understand some of the form, although, you could still find value in it and figure it out by watching the DVD a time or two before participating. I actually had a breakthrough in improving my form from something she said.
I also wish that she had an additional workout, maybe a second stretching workout or additional poses you could opt into with the menu before starting the workout.
The progressions are simple, but if you have been practicing yoga for a long time, you will still find that you can make them challenging.  She also leads you through Kegel exercises better than any other DVD I've seen.  She does the Kegels just long enough to understand why they are in the context of the DVD without overkill(afterall, how much of a DVD do you need devoted to something you can do anywhere).
Of the prenatal yoga DVDs available, I think this is the best option, and a pretty good one at that.",1071792000,86,1662,4.457236842105263
7992979,5,B00009RXM3,Very easy to use when I was in my 3rd trimester. They show you the different poses to use at each trimester to help you in any way. The video went at a good pace and as a beginner I found it very easy to follow.,1456444800,,211,3.608695652173913
7992980,2,B00009RXM3,"Too much sitting on bolsters, not enough actual yoga.  Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean I can't actually exercise.  There are too many positions claiming to help with labor, when in reality labor pain is just super bad and no exercises are going to help.  I just want to stay fit and limber, so I'm doing modified regular yoga instead.",1447113600,,341,4.65
7992981,5,B00009RXM3,This is a wonderful gentle way to stretch the body during pregnancy that feels comfortable and safe. I had tried multiple DVD's for a healthy way to keep my body feeling good while pregnant and this one was the only one that I could do comfortably up until I delivered. If you are looking for more of a challenge I would not suggest this workout but if you like relaxing stretches and deep breathes then it's a great way to move your body everyday in conjunction with moderate exercise such as walking.,1421020800,,502,4.467391304347826
7992982,4,B00009RXM3,"I have only done this video a couple times so far but just started my second trimester so plenty of time still. The first time I did this video, I hated it. This lady is super, super chatty and her instructions are not clear. I haven't done any yoga before this video so I didn't know what the poses were and got frustrated when in a position where I could not see her (my head down, facing the floor) and could not understand what to do based on her instructions. I had to watch her do a pose, rewind and then do it. This obviously took a lot longer to get through the video. The last part of the video you're supposed to relax and let go, but her non-stop talking was so distracting and annoying that I almost did not finish the video.

The second time I tried the video, I liked it much more. Even though I've never done yoga before, by the second time through I was familiar with the poses and could focus on my posture, body and breathing. I felt very relaxed and stretched afterwards. It seems like the poses are going to be really good for preparing my body for labor (which is why I gave this 4 stars). There is a section of squatting, opening your hips, stretching your back, balancing, strengthening your kegels etc.

I was disappointed with the so called bonus labor preparation video. It is a few select segments from the regular video, so if you do the entire regular video, no need to do the bonus video.

Over-all, I will continue to use this video throughout my pregnancy and do believe it will help prepare my body for labor. I would definitely recommend this video to another yoga beginner.",1408147200,,1608,4.3533333333333335
7992983,4,B00009RXM3,"I enjoyed this Dvd throughout my entire pregnancy.  I felt like I got a bit of a workout in while feeling relaxed and rejuvenated at the same time.  I liked the instructor because she spoke of gratitude regarding labor and pregnancy in a positive light.  I did not like how long the explanations of doing certain poses were.  I am not new to yoga so it was just a little frustrating waiting for her to finish explaining how to do a certain pose after doing tvd for maybe the 4th time.  Overall, I could look past this and enjoyed it.  I would do this again for the next pregnancy.",1401408000,,580,4.275229357798165
7992984,5,B00009RXM3,This DVD was recommended to me and I am so pleased I purchased it! It provides the right amount of workout without over doing it and also provides exercise modifications for each stage of pregnancy. I purchased it primarily to still have some form of stretching since I am a regular Zumba exerciser but aren't able to do it due to the pregnancy. I would definitely recommend!,1377820800,,375,4.611940298507463

7992986,5,B00009RXM3,"This is one of our favorite prenatal yoga tapes. My wife and I do them together. It is challenging, but appropriate for pregnancy with modifications for different trimesters. It is nice for someone who is actually pregnant to lead a prenatal video.

7992987,3,B00009RXM3,"I gave this video 3 stars even though I did not like it because I can see how it might be good for others.  I wanted a yoga workout video that would be an actual ""workout"" that I could do safely while pregnant and this was not that.  It is more of a breathing, stretching, posing video rather than a vigorous exercise video.  I didn't even break a sweat.  I much prefer ""Prenatal Vinyasa & Short Forms"" if you are looking for more of a workout routine.  For those of you looking for more of a calming, centering, birth preparation video, this is probably for you.",1368576000,,563,4.273584905660377
