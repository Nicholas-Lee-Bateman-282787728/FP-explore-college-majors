5469785,3,B00AQAZZ3Q,"It's hard to believe that the Power Rangers franchise is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. It is making me feel old as I remember when the original series aired. I watched the occasional episodes of the original series up to the In Space series, but I tuned out because the constant cast changes. I wasn't aware that there was a new series on television, until I reviewed two other DVD titles early this year. Lionsgate recently released Saban's Power Rangers: Clash of the Red Rangers: The Movie onto DVD this month and I was sent a complementary copy in exchange for my honest review.

Clash of Red Rangers originally aired in November 2011 on Nickelodeon as an hour special that teamed up the six Samurai Rangers with the RPM Ranger Red. The plot involves the RPM Ranger Red chasing the robotic villain Professor Cog from the RPM alternate universe into the real world, where the Samurai Rangers are fighting the newest Nighlok called Sharkjaw, who runs away in defeat. Cog finds an entrance to the Netherworld as he wants to use the water to destroy the humans in his own universe. To get the water he agrees to help Xandred's Nighlok army in defeating the Power Rangers.

Grinders attack the Samurai Rangers and the rangers only win because RPM Ranger Red used his nitro blaster to destroy the Grinders. The Samurai Rangers gladly accept their new friend, though Jayden has a few issues with him. Cog returns with several Grinders leading the Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, and Gold rangers to be zapped to the RPM universe. The Nighlok are building a huge army to invade earth and only the two red rangers are left to stop them, but only if they can work out their differences.

After previously viewing the last two Power Ranger DVDs, I have been in the mood to watch more as it takes me back to my youth. The Clash of the Red Rangers is less of a movie and more of a two-part episode as it is only 45 minutes in length. The plot is a little thin, but most of us don't watch Power Rangers for the plot as we watch it for the fun Zords VS Monsters mash-up. Besides from the quick fight between the Sky Rev Megazord and Professor Cog at the opening, you have to wait until the very end for the even quicker fight between the Samurai Shark Megazord and General Gut. I've never seen the RPM series, so I'm not for sure if the Ranger Red is the same voice. He never takes off his helmet because he can't breathe the air. I also do not know why Antonio (the Gold Ranger) is barely in it. Considering the short running time, I would have thought there would have been a bonus episode or two, but there wasn't. The special features that are on it are: The Power Rangers MEGA Album Playlist Video, ""Train Like a Ranger"" video, ""Bloopers"" Featurette, and ""Auditions"" Featurette.

Overall, Clash of the Red Rangers is silly and fun, even though it is only 45 minutes. Sure, it could have been better written, but it is what is. I'm sure that younger kids will enjoy watching the movie.",1363478400,3,2987,4.495395948434623
5469786,5,B00AQAZZ3Q,the power rangers have been around forever and my son still enjoys watching them!!!!!!!!!!!its classic action adventure and some comedy too.,1362873600,,140,5.714285714285714
5469787,4,B00AQAZZ3Q,i really enjoyed being able to watch another power rangers movie. They do not make many of them anymore this is the first one in a long time. its a simple plot save the world type deal its all there the megazord the giant monster battle great martial arts action great movie for people like me who enjoy these films. i hope they release more power ranger movies in the future or at least release the ones that were released on vhs years ago or even if they make them only 45 minutes long thats fine with me.,1362528000,2,507,4.183673469387755
5469788,2,B00AQAZZ3Q,"I agree with the other reviewers who have commented about ""Clash of the Red Rangers,"" and
Samurai in general.  I noticed something else wrong with ""Clash"":  when did it take place?
RPM ended with all the robots destroyed.  Were RPM and Samurai happening at the same time?
If not, the continuity of the whole franchise has been severely compromised.  Also, why invent a
villain that never appeared in RPM?  I think it's safe to say that Samurai was a prime example of
Saban Brands 'pulling a Gallano'.  For anyone who is a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, one of them
will recognize the character Gallano from the movie ""Mitchell"" starring Joe Don Baker.  Gallano was a
mobster portrayed by well-known character actor Harold J. Stone.  He affected a very bad Italian accent,
causing Crow T. Robot to comment: ""He was hastily put together, wasn't he?"" Such was the case for
the whole Samurai series.  Nothing in Power Rangers was that bad since ""Trakeena's Revenge.""
Hopefully, the Saban staff has learned its lesson and won't repeat those disasters.  So far, Megaforce
seems to be progressing a lot better than Samurai.  The only problem is that the cast wears the same
clothes in every episode.  That fashion faux pas hasn't occurred since Wild Force.  Hopefully, that will be
rectified ASAP.",1362441600,,1296,4.863013698630137
5469789,2,B00AQAZZ3Q,"First, I'm not a fan of Samurai. At all. And I've been watching Power Rangers for years and years.

This is a stinker. First, I know why logistically and financially why Eka Darville wasn't available to be there in the flesh (working on an American TV series, and had gone SAG). But that's no excuse for a terrible, terrible teamup. My problems start from the moment that subway train pulls in. The idea that RPM is a different dimension, I don't exactly buy that. I prefer to say it's different relative to Samurai. Proof: Assuming PR series generally take place in the year they air, tell me how old Skull would have to have been when Spike was conceived? But I digress.

Another problem is right there on the box. This is only a teamup with *one ranger.* Last time we didn't get a teamup without the full team (Once a Ranger aside) was one of the teamup episodes in SPD. And even then, the RPM-side footage used like that first Megazord scene is out of character and there is very little grounding it in the RPM universe, not even where in the RPM storyline Scott's appearance takes place.

And none of the other rangers appear, only getting a throwaway mention when the other Samurais come back (""Your team says hi.""). They could have shown us the Samurais in the RPM universe, fighting Grinders with our old Corinthian buddies. Instead, they may as well have been in Ohio for half the episode.

This is among the best of Samurai I've seen, which is kind of like saying, ""That was the best root canal I've ever had. Let's try it without the novocaine next time."" Get it for Ranger Red, if you must. Or Netflix it for far cheaper.",1362009600,,1633,4.469798657718121
5469790,1,B00AQAZZ3Q,"This is not a movie , if anything its long enough to be a two part episode . I like it , but anyone who thinks that anything less then 80 minutes long is a movie is ither an r-tard or just trying to sell as many copies as possible by falsely calling it a movie . Wake up and smell the coffee you gullible power ranger fans , & make shure you tell all of those ripoff artists and others like them that if they want to make a real movie , it better be more than 79 minutes freaking long !!!!!",1358726400,2,490,3.766990291262136
5469791,5,B00AQAZZ3Q,"ok for the older fans who like the shinkenger version this probably isn't for you only hardcore fans and kids are gonna dig this film.

5469792,2,B00AQAZZ3Q,"As a Power Ranger fan I've seen every episode since the beginning.  Samurai has been the worse season of PR sadly, and Clash isn't really any better.  But they try I guess.  It's alright compared to the rest of Samurai for what that's worth.  But what is up with the price mix up?  It's listed at the time of this review as over $1000, um...yeah...someone goofed big time.",1356048000,4,372,4.411764705882353

5469797,3,B00AQAZZ3Q,Was Scott even in this??? He claims he doesn't know if he can breathe the earths air so he stays in costume the whole time from start to finish. We don't even see him morph.  The voice sounds like Scott but why couldn't we see him de morph at least once????  Why make this movie if you can't get the original actor from rpm in this?  #lame,1441065600,,339,4.029850746268656

This was after my mephew gave up and seeing this incarnation, the Samurai, it was cool and fun too. Seeing another Red Ranger from a different dimension enter the fray...oh yeah, but we never see him de-morphed, that was a little disappointing. Anyway it was fun.",1408320000,2,441,4.325301204819277

Jayden and Scott are attacked that make them turn against each other but in the end they end up working together to stop the bad guys and save the day.

power rangers mega album play list, where the samurai rangers redo cover albums from various artists, i thought this was unique and interesting. theres interviews with the 5 rangers, how to train like a ranger featurette and bloopers from the series, not from the movie sadly.

this movie should really be released on Bluray. Lionsgate, stop being cheap and stoopid. give power rangers samurai a bluray release, as well as this movie. the series looks too awesome to be on dvd. but to everyone else, please support these dvds!",1379030400,2,586,4.909090909090909

I recommend it to other buyers if ur a power ranger fan great movie",1376870400,3,128,4.12
5469816,2,B00AQAZZ3Q,"First - it is only 45 minutes - I would much rather have 60-90 minutes of distraction, speaking as ""Nana"" - for that price, I was surprised it was so short.

I haven't actually watched it, and couldn't tell you exactly WHY he doesn't like it, just that he could watch the original movie 20 times in a row, and the same with the Turbo movie, and the various collections of the TV shows. This one, he just isn't interested in.",1376611200,,424,4.234567901234568
5469817,1,B00AQAZZ3Q,Power Rangers is just awful on almost every level. Why they even have the female rangers is beyond me. All they get to do is clean and cheer on the boys. It's ridiculous.,1373328000,,170,4.181818181818182
5469818,4,B00AQAZZ3Q,"I actually thought that Power Rangers was a bit old for my three and five year olds but they insisted they wanted to watch Clash of the Red Rangers so I figured I'd give it a shot.

As soon as I saw the fire and explosions at the beginning I thought, uh-oh, they are going to be scared. Nope - they were excited! Paige actually loved all the different bad guys and was really into their weird costumes and appearances.

My kids like to sword fight with their dad every day (Nerf swords) so I think part of the appeal was all of the fighting. I know some parents oppose this violence but I think for my kids right now it's ok because they understand it's not real. While I don't always love the swords everywhere in my house, I think it's helped my kids separate fantasy from reality. Power Rangers even taught them some new moves to use on their dad!

I appreciate that there is a girl Power Ranger. I want my daughter to know girls can be heroes too. And of course if you ask her who her favorite is, she'll enthusiastically respond: ""the pink one!""

I do think this movie is geared to older kids but if you have young ones like mine that sometimes appreciate older movies, go for it! But if you are against bad guys and violence, probably better skip this one.

I never thought I would say this but Power Rangers: Clash of the Red Rangers just moved to the top of the most requested list in my house! Go Go Power Rangers!",1369526400,2,1423,4.236162361623617

5469821,3,B00AQAZZ3Q,"I've never understood the appeal of these low-grade productions, but my son is engulfed in the Power Rangers universe.  He loves this DVD.",1364428800,,138,5.0
5469822,4,B00AQAZZ3Q,"I'm not sure why people bash this dvd so much. Remember, Nickelodeon's movies for TV are 45 minutes so I don't know why the length is a surprise. And this is not a team up of RPM & Samurai. This is simply Red RPM Ranger appearing for the movie (as the title blatantly states).

This movie lives up to the title and we get to see 2 red rangers fight it out in a very cool storyline. It's fast-paced and any of the more quieter scenes are just long enough to keep your head exploding from awesome power rangers action.

Positives: Although 45 minutes, it's a great 45 minutes of action.

Negatives: A little rushed and of course Jack not appearing in the movie drags it down a little (despite lending his voice talents).

Plus this dvd is short. Other Samurai dvds have 3 or 4 episodes plus extras while this has the filler of 2 episodes and re-used extras.

It's good, but get it cheap if you can.",1363564800,,896,4.27810650887574
