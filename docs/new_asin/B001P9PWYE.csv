8332890,5,B001P9PWYE,"Even though this is ages ago, you can see the brilliance in Greg from an early age, and his instruction is fantastic!  A must for all guitar playaz!",1370563200,,148,4.285714285714286
8332891,3,B001P9PWYE,"*NOT A CRITICISM OF GREG, BUT WITH THE *TUNING* CAUSED BY THE TRANSFER TO DVD BY ALFRED PUBLISHING*

It's an inspiring/informative/funny video from one of the greatest guitarists of the last few decades!!!

...BUT in the transfer from VHS to DVD, they must have had the playback speed on the VHS set too fast. Greg's TUNING on the whole DVD about a half step sharp! All of my guitars have locking trems, so having to readjust the bridge to play along is annoying. No biggie if you have a guitar with a non-floating bridge/trem, but it still seems rediculous to tune HIGHER than A440. Even if I had a non-locking instrument, it's the principle of the thing!

PLEASE don't think I'm a complete unfair/picky nutjob. If this was a Jake E. Lee, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix or Roth-era Van Halen instructional video, I would expect to get a guitar ready for E-flat tuning, for example.

Alfred Publishing should be checking these kinds of things before printing tons of these DVD's.",1291161600,,981,4.719298245614035
8332892,5,B001P9PWYE,Greg was young and still developing in this video but there is still so much there.  Worth it if only for Greg's intro solo and the warm up exercises,1269820800,,149,4.137931034482759
8332893,5,B001P9PWYE,"Great to see this video being released again. a look into former shrapnel guitarist Greg Howes style at the time ( hes went into a far more jazz fusion vein since). what can i say, like all the shred instructionals from the late 80's early 90's, its campy (remember jim from the tv show taxi? he makes an appearance....sort of) and its starts off with a long mind bendingly fast neoclassical type howe solo. there are some good warm up patterns, what seem to me as oddly arranged scale patterns to go with Gregs picking techniques. the tab is onscreen...no booklets or anything, but greg goes through everything note by note slow. its a bit lacking in content compared to the modern shred virtuoso videos and greg seems uncomfortable in front of the camera but as a howe fan i recommend it to other howe fans. as to aspiring shredders id say youd be better off taking webcam lessons with greg himself, his techniques and style has progressed hugely since the making of this video. and hes a great teacher.",1248998400,2,1005,4.588888888888889
