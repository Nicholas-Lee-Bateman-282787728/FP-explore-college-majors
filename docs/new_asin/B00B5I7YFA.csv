8562949,4,B00B5I7YFA,"Melvyn Douglas as a suave French master thief? Oh, heck, why not? 1938's ARSENE LUPIN RETURNS reacquaints us, cinematically, with Maurice Leblanc's audacious gentleman thief. A notorious operator, Arsne Lupin has been known to occasionally side with the angels and solve a mystery or two. Except rumor has it that Lupin had gotten killed some years ago. Still, when attempts are made to steal the De Grissac Emerald, guess who's implicated? Certainly not Rene Farrand, prosperous breeder of pigs and terriers and fiance to the lovely Lorraine de Grissac (Virginia Bruce), owner of that same fabulous emerald necklace. Is it important that M. Farrand appeared out of nowhere three years ago just as the legendary master thief perished? Probably not, no... Maybe.

ARSENE LUPIN RETURNS is the sequel to ARSENE LUPIN, the 1932 mystery that starred John Barrymore (as Lupin) and his brother Lionel (as the pursuing detective). This sequel finds Melvyn Douglas and Warren William jockeying for prominent leading man honors, with Douglas, I think, winning by the thinnest hair. The film opens up with those news rags trumpeting the greatness of nervy top G-Man Steve Emerson (William). But Emerson's eye for publicity at last renders him useless to the FBI (hard to nab them crooks when your mug is plastered across the front pages). Emerson lands a gig as an insurance consultant, and it's just his luck that his first case pits him against the infamous international jewel thief Arsne Lupin, not quite as dead as initially presumed. Emerson's snooping takes him across the pond to Paris, to Lupin's bailiwick.

In France, Emerson shakes hands with Rene Farrand, and I don't doubt that there's mutual sizing up going on, especially since it's obvious that both men have their eyes on Lorraine de Grissac. Too, Rene ponders the perplexing framejob that lobs accusations at Arsne Lupin's feet, what with Rene - who, yes, is the real Arsne Lupin - having stayed on the straight and narrow for the past three years. To resolve this conundrum, he comes out of retirement. It doesn't help his investigation that his two former henchmen, thinking that their boss had gotten back in the game without sending them a memo, come a-knockin'. Their bumbling presence complicates things for Rene, makes a former G-Man go ""Hmmm...""

ARSENE LUPIN RETURNS is a 1938 suspense thriller with healthy chunks of levity injected. It's entertaining and brisk and it's over before you know it. Never mind the pedestrian whodunit aspect. The good bits revolve around the urbane matching of wits between Lupin and Emerson. Their rivalry is never more pronounced than in that one drawing room sequence in which the gents partake in an escalating game of oneupmanship. Sad to say, Emerson's ripping the phone book in half just may have beaten out Lupin's paltry parlor tricks. Ah, but which one solves the mystery? Which one lands the girl? Which one edges out the other in the ""I'm more raffish than you are, neener-neener!"" department? It may be worth your time to see ARSENE LUPIN RETURNS to find out. Ironically, Warren William himself would repeatedly take on the role of another daring gentleman burglar, the Lone Wolf (although, okay, Melvyn Douglas, too, would have a shot at playing the same character in 1935's THE LONE WOLF RETURNS). This bout of gamesmanship may never have been satisfactorily resolved.",1402963200,,3381,5.0447227191413235
