5425895,1,B00AIA88AQ,"This is a fabulous movie; stars are Yul Brenner and Kay Kendall.  It is a wonderfully funny movie, made in the late 1960's or 1970's.
Kay Kendall is a very funny actress, who is beautiful, an extremely good and very funny actress.  It has only recently become available  and I ordered a copy as soon as I heard about its availability.  This is one of my all time favorite movies !",1363910400,,380,4.309859154929577
5425896,5,B00AIA88AQ,"If you like funny movies...if you like Yul Brynner and/or Kay Kendall, you will love this movie! It even has a smidge of classical music. It is worth seeing the movie just to see THE BED. I won't describe it...just watch it. I can't believe this never got more fame and 'movie cred'...it's great!",1362528000,3,296,4.5
5425897,5,B00AIA88AQ,"Although not as well remembered as Jean Harlow or Carole Lombard, Kay Kendall was one of only a handful
of actresses who were stunningly beautiful, hysterically funny, and who died MUCH too young. Like Lombard, she started out in straight dramatic roles. Then, in GENEVIEVE, she showed her funny side, and there was no looking back. With the release of ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING, all three of her best movies are now available on DVD ...
LES GIRLS, THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE and now this one. Yul Brynner is also wonderful in one of his rare comic performances. If you cherish great cinematic comedies, this one's a keeper!",1360195200,10,619,4.794392523364486
5425898,1,B00AIA88AQ,"This DVD was very poor quality. There was no narrative,just ""diso-like"" music in the background. A child could have put this together with a computer. This was supposed to be a gift to my husband who served on this ship during operation Sea Orbit. He was embarrased that the first nuclear powered air craft carrier was treated to such mistreatment by Military Films. I believe that the clips on the carrier might have come from left-over footage. The music was a major distraction since there was nothing nautical or patriotic sounding. Somewhere there must be REAL official film of the exploits of this carrier. VERY DISAPPOINTING!",1304726400,4,632,4.971698113207547

5425900,5,B00AIA88AQ,"Truly funny. My first exposure to Kay Kendall--she's marvelous, but Yul Brynner  is the big surprise here. I've seen him in many movies, but never a comedy. He's a riot. Who knew!",1430092800,2,179,4.59375
5425901,4,B00AIA88AQ,"I remembered the movie as hilariously funny with a wonderful performance by Gregory Ratoff (a takeoff on Sol Hurok). It is still very entertaining, but it seems to strain for laughs a little too strenuously now.",1424822400,,211,4.888888888888889

5425906,3,B00AIA88AQ,"When the wife (Kay Kendall) of a narcissistic and high strung orchestra conductor (Yul Brynner) catches him with a young girl (Shirley Anne Field), she leaves him. When she wants to get married again, she asks for a divorce but there's one small problem ..... they were never married in the first place! So they must secretly get married and then divorced (this is 1960 after all) so she'll be free to marry again. But the conductor, who's still on love with her, has other plans. Based on an only modestly successful Broadway farce by Harry Kurnitz (who also wrote the screenplay), material like this needs to sparkle like champagne. What we get is a drink of tepid water. Watching the actors flapping around in an attempt to induce laughter, one calmly listens to the dull dialog thinking, ""Oh, there's supposed to be a laugh here"" as you sit there stone faced. Brynner is all wrong for this kind of farce that cries out for a Rex Harrison or even a Danny Kaye. He just doesn't have the comic timing needed. Kendall (who died at 33 before the film opened) looks stunning in her Givenchy outfits, fares better but nothing is going to help. It's a static film that lazily doesn't even bother to hide its stage bound roots. Directed by Stanley Donen (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN), who usually has a better touch for material like this. With Gregory Ratoff, rechanneling his Max Fabian from ALL ABOUT EVE and Martin Benson.

The Sony MOD DVDr is a very nice anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1395446400,,1487,4.632575757575758
5425907,5,B00AIA88AQ,So happy when I finally found this. Had searched for years! What a cast! It's light entertainment but I loved the sparring between Yul Brynner and Kay Kendall. How lovely she was and how tragic we lost her so young..,1393459200,,216,4.425
5425908,5,B00AIA88AQ,"This film I saw on it's initial release. I enjoyed it for it's subtle wit and the performances of Kay Kendall, Yul Brynner and Gregory Ratoff. I wondered why it was not available on DVD for many years, considering the re-issues of  films that were with less qualities than this one. Happily, now I have my own copy. I have enjoyed it twice since it arrived. It will be watched again. As I am much older than when I first watched it, I found it had more subtlety in the dialogue and characterization of the central characters. Yul Brynner seemed to quietly send up his own screen persona and Kay Kendall's beauty was never captured on screen so close to perfection as in Once More With Feeling. As an post script, my eldest grand daughter is a music student, learning viola. She has played in a schools' orchestra. She needs to meet Victor Fabian. It will help keep her feet on the ground and introduce her to the unpredictability of the temperament of the ""artistic genius"".",1390953600,4,974,4.534090909090909

5425911,5,B00AIA88AQ,I loved this movie when I first saw it and have always wanted to add it to my collection.  I snapped it up when I saw it on Amazon.

5425912,1,B00AIA88AQ,"Search Amazon for ""Ghibli 17"" before buying this junk!

Every year a new set comes along that's the next best thing, this year the 17 movie version is the ""next best thing!"" It added 1 movie on disc 6 (Poppy Hill), added a cardboard slipcase and is using a case that basically can't break in the mail. Also, each disc now has beautiful artwork depicting each movie vs the old boring art. The only other change is Arrietty now has the US, UK and Japanese audio options. All 6 discs played fine. Some of the older versions with 16 movies have known problems with the 2nd and 6th disc because of poor manufacturing. If you do decide to buy one of the other 16 movie sets LOOK AT THE BACK OF EACH DISC, most of them will have fingerprints and scratches on the data side GUARANTEED.

The newer 17 movie version comes with a nice cardboard slipcase to further protect the strong case inside. ***The only drawback I've seen (on any version) is since 2-3 movies are on each disc the video quality is ""decent,"" but not quite Blu-ray or HD crispness**, but heck for the price I'm very happy, and my kids can't get enough! All 17 movies have both English audio track, and also has a Japanese audio with English subtitles.

There is another very cheap 16 movie set (sold by Sword) that the discs are ok, but the case is so flimsy they literally use rubber bands to hold it together in the mail (serious read their feedback!). There's yet another set that uses a single hub black case which all 6 discs are stacked on top each other. Some think the single hub is bad, but it actually protects the discs if one of the individual holders come loose, then that disc flys all over inside the case (not a good thing). The 17 movie set has a case you probably can't break, but I noticed the discs are kinda hard to get off the very inner spindle. Some of the 16 movie set's cases are similar, but made of some sort of cheaper plastic that causes it to break easily.

VERY IMPORTANT: Just be sure to read each seller's individual description as to exactly what they are selling. NOT the Amazon description, but the INDIVIDUAL seller's comments that each seller uses to describe their product. There's at least 5 versions I'm aware of, this one you get an impressive foil embossed slipcover + 1 more movie. If you don't want Poppy Hill just buy a cheaper set, again, just make sure you read the seller's comments.",1381276800,2,2392,4.417233560090703
5425913,4,B00AIA88AQ,"Yul Brynner set as a proud and narcissistic conductor who lost his wife, his muse, due to his infidelity. He must go through all to get her back, including a thorough self reflection which he did half heartedly until he realised that he is truly losing her to another man. Kay Kendall was excellent, she played her role to perfection. She 'managed' Yul in this movie as his wife brilliantly.",1376092800,3,391,4.6
5425914,5,B00AIA88AQ,"Most of the reviews here focus on this highly interesting film as a sparkling comedy enlivened by the exquisite final performance of the deeply regretted Kay Kendall.  There's no denying her success in lifting this film above its rather mediocre dramatic realities.  Perhaps her finest moment comes while she listens to a televised interview with Yul Brynner, as her husband---a monumentally (think Mount Rushmore) egotistical orchestra conductor.  Her ongoing reactions to his pompous and self-serving statements, which the audience immediately realize are so much crap, bring to mind one word: Vitameatavegemin.  You know what I mean.  Kendall's handling of that scene could have been hammed up to a fare-thee-well, but she handles it every bit as eloquently as the Vitameatavegemin lady handled that scene.

Brynner's performance sadly suggests something of what might have been had the studios ever been able to decide what to do with him.  He presented formidable obstacles to being cast in major roles, starting of course with his bare scalp, but also arising from that matchlessly deep, sonorous voice and Russian accent.  He proved in ""Kings of the Sun"" that he was a viable action star, but even there he had to be cast as an exotic type---an Indian chief---to accommodate his appearance and speech.  ""Once more..."" shows that he had it in him to succeed in comic roles too, but again his persona got in the way. (""The Buccaneer,"" made around the same time as ""Once More..."" also gives him a few very effective comic moments, but there again he was given a wig and cast as a French pirate in the Caribbean.)  Apart from his repeated tours in ""The King and I,"" he was repeatedly cast as Europeans, evil Nazis or Russians threatening Hungarians or other Eastern Europeans.  Today he would probably have no trouble gaining access to a wider range of roles; for the 1950s and 60s, his choices were sadly limited, and his career suffered.

One way the designer of this film got around Brynner's bare scalp was to meet it (pardon the expression) head-on.  Every work of art in the conductor's house, whether painting or sculpture, is of Brynner's character, so the audience is constantly brought face to face with that shaved head, itself a striking departure from established convention in the 1950s.  One might adopt that for one role, as Brynner himself did for ""The King and I"" in 1951, but until the more adventurous '60s nobody except Brynner kept it that way. (Telly Savalas first shaved for ""King of Kings"" in '62; the best-known of the other '60s skinheads, Shel Silverstein, adopted the tonsure only in '64 to deal with a receding hairline.)  Note that throughout the picture, whenever Brynner stands in front of one of the paintings (nearly all of which show him in dramatic conducting poses), he adopts the pose shown in the painting behind him.  Of course the ubiquitous display of Brynner's most recognizable feature is meant to demonstrate the conductor's immense ego even as it plays up the bald head AND at the same time, neatly diminishes its impact.  Surprisingly enough, it works.  It really does work.

During a recent viewing of ""Once more..."" I suddenly (and unexpectedly) became aware of what a film like this must have seemed like to experienced eyes in the late 1950s. (I would have been 12 when I first saw it theatrically, so ""experienced"" didn't apply to me.)  The film contains a number of surprising bits of business and sight gags that must have struck knowing viewers as quite risqu.  Two examples suffice.  In one scene, as Brynner and his agent are riding in the conductor's limousine, Brynner makes a suggestion to resolve a current crisis, a suggestion that strikes the agent as quite mad.  The agent takes the cigarette Brynner is smoking and sniffs it to be sure it's really just tobacco.  Today the implications are obvious, but I doubt that would have been the case for most people at the time this film was made and released.  Later, when Kendall is doing her magnificent best to resolve a quarrel between Brynner and the principal violinist in his orchestra, the violinist admits to her that he has one weak finger on his left hand (the hand that creates the pitches on a violin's fingerboard). He holds up that particular finger to show her.  You can guess which one it is.  I'm sure the actor playing the violinist was cast because of the unusual length of his fingers, that one in particular.  And gven that finger's implications, Kendall's restrained reaction to the sight of it is exquisitely priceless.

There are other such moments, e.g., when Brynner escorts Kendall upstairs, obviously intending to engage in intimacy, and says he has ""a surprise"" for her; she archly asks ""Is it bigger than a breadbox?""  Including such fleeting but unmistakable references in what was supposedly a family film in Mamie Eisenhower's USA  could not possibly have been accidental. Coded though they may have been for an audience of that time, they are unmistakably THERE and make ""Once more..."" an unexpected point of departure from mainstream society of the '50s to the lurking changes of the '60s.  The subtlety with which these moments are embedded in the film makes them all the more enjoyable even now, at a time when we are far less sensitive to such things.

For one major reason, I believe these allusions were deliberate.  The cast includes the familiar presence of Gregory Ratoff as the perpetually harried agent to the gifted great. Ratoff had trod the same ground in 1950's ""All About Eve,"" as agent to Bette Davis' temperamental Margo Channing.  In ""All About Eve,"" Ratoff's character was named Max Fabian, and in ""Once More..."" his first name is also Max.  The name of Brynner's character in ""Once More..."" is Victor Fabian, however, so the agent's last name is not Fabian but Archer.  I can't help concluding that Ratoff's casting was deliberate for just this reason---Ratoff's virtually identical character in both films, and the repetition of the names Fabian and Max.  If the production crew on ""Once More..."" was this attuned to these resonances in what they were doing, they were attuned as well to other resonances, so I think they knew all about ""Once More's..."" subtly embedded allusions to subterranean currents that would tumultuously become so markedly less subterranean by 1970.

A major plot theme is, moreover, the fact that Brynner and Kendall are not married; everybody thinks they are, but they've really been living together for 8 years.  Unwed cohabitation was not unknown in 1960 but it wasn't advertised as honestly as nowadays.  I think this got past the censors only because the film is not set in the pristine USA of those distant days, but in London, so it didn't have to be seen as a straightforward picture of US society.  People over there did that sort of thing all the time, and Brynner is supposed to be an artsy type, and in the end they do get married. It's foreign and safe, so it's OK. None the less, so open an acknowledgment of Living In Sin must have been at least mildly surprising to US audiences of that day.

To sum up, we've got 2 solid comedic performances from 2 very competent actors; highly imaginative and successful set design that contributes a great deal to the film's success; a literate script and skilled direction that point toward changes that were on the brink of transforming the world.  What's not to like?  Not much I can think of.  Maybe those novelties, and the then-hidden realities they suggested, were what kept this little jewel from the wider recognition it deserved. I'd like to know, but probably we never will find out.  So just enjoy this very special film.  Enjoy it a lot.",1375315200,6,7697,4.862068965517241
5425915,5,B00AIA88AQ,"I am so glad I finally found this movie!! I remembered watching it on TMC years ago, and ever since then I have been searching for it high and low...and leave it to Amazon to have it!!

This is a hilarious film! Yul Brenner is just fantastic, it is a shame he did not do more comedy. His timing and wit are classic! And Ka Kendall was a force of nature--both on the screen, and off given how ill she was during the making of this film. She was a great loss to the film industry. There was also great chemistry between these too, which made the film even more fun to watch. This is definitely one to have in your classic film collection.

Thank You Amazon for carrying this rare and hard to find title!!",1373068800,,702,4.154411764705882
5425916,4,B00AIA88AQ,"I had never heard of this movie OR Kay Kendall. It's a rather predictable adaption of a comedic play, but Brynner and Kendall played it perfectly. I loved the narcissist character with paintings and sculptures of himself all over the house.",1370044800,,240,4.878048780487805
5425917,3,B00AIA88AQ,"Years ago I caught this funny movie on TCM and LOVED IT.  Knowing how orchestral musicians, conductors, and patrons can be (neurotic, egomaniacal and clueless, respectively), I very much appreciated the jokes and the situations.  The ""retro"" audio equipment is cool too.  I looked for this DVD before it came available because I want to share it with friends.  I watched it once and it ran fine, but the second time, it got hung up and I had to skip ahead to scenes several times.  I'd hate to invite friends over for a ""screening"" and have this happen.  So--at least 4 stars for the movie but 1 or 2 for the condition of the disk.",1369872000,,631,4.443478260869565
5425918,4,B00AIA88AQ,"It's poignant to watch this film, an intended comic battle of the sexes about a egotistical conductor Victor Fabian of the London Festival Orchestra(Yul Brynner)and his mercurial though charming wife Dolly(Kay Kendall). By the time of it's initial release in February 1960, Kay Kendall had been dead almost six months. She had been fighting leukemia for several years, but she was unaware of her condition, thinking that she had a severe iron deficiency.  However, her husband Rex Harrison knew the truth, and had confided it to several friends, and it seems it was an open secret in the theatrical community.  Filming was done in Paris, with Kendall's fragility becoming more and more evident.  When the film was two thirds completed, she had to be hospitalized, but managed to rally to wrap it up.

In this film, you can see the physical evidence of her illness for the first time, Ms. Kendall looks painfully thin and frail, but still matchlessly elegant gowned in chic creations by Parisian courtier Hubert de Givenchy. Although the screenplay by Harry Kurnitz adapted from his Broadway play is very slight, Ms. Kendall rises to the occasion and turns in a final scintillating performance.  She is the best thing about the film, I just wish she had a stronger role for her last performance.

Sophisticated, high styled comedy was not co-star Yul Brynner's forte, he comes off as heavy handed, and oddly Stanley Donen's direction so wonderful in ""Indiscreet"" is off kilter here.  Kay Kendall enchanting and effervescent is the reason you'll want to see ""Once More, with Feeling!"". My four star rating is solely for her, tragically a star that got away.",1369785600,,1655,4.97463768115942

The storyline - a narcissistic conductor who has been ""living in sin"" with a harpist (this movie was made over 50 years ago) could have been extremely funny if Kay Kendall had made this film with Rex Harrison - - -they were hysterical in ""The Reluctant Debutante"" - - but I just didn't feel the chemistry between Yul Brenner and her.  Yes, Yul Brenner is a very good actor, and excellent at playing the imperious man, excellent at playing a narcissistic conductor, but I didn't feel the connection between he and Kay Kendall.  It seemed that the only connection they had to each other was sex.  He certainly didn't understand her and treated her as a second class citizen.  I love a good comedy, and the story line had a cute premise - individually each one did a good job in their role, but together they just didn't have the spark.
