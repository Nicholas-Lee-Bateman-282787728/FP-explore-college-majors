5205883,3,B0090JBD8A,"My (young) adult children introduced me to Kick Ass several years ago, which I loved as an over-the-top farce with ironic humor, great music, excellent sets, bizarre but interesting characters, a brilliant style of directing and filming, and an actual storyline that had a beginning, middle, and end. I found Kick Ass 2 entertaining, it held my interest until the end, but it was not near as good as the original. A strong story line was simply missing. The plot I am sure was written to be consistent with the comic book series, but I had honestly hoped for more than just the usual teenage angst, the mean high school girls throwing up in the lunch room, and Red Mist changing his name to something unprintable and making odd fashion choices. Still, this is a must see for those interested in following the original story, seeing what happens to the surviving characters from Kick Ass, and of course those interested in seeing how far Hit Girl will evolve as a super hero.",1376697600,6,974,4.6686046511627906
5205884,5,B0090JBD8A,"If you liked the first Kick Ass movie, you will love the sequel.  Previous reviewers have already touched on the story, and I don't want to spoil it for you by giving you more tidbits.  Let's just say that Kick Ass and Hit Girl's persona's will be fleshed out a bit more and there is action and intrigue as well as drama(involving Hit Girl).  Go watch already.",1376611200,8,360,4.343283582089552

5205886,4,B0090JBD8A,"I was intrigued by the original Kick Ass, but not quite a fan after seeing it initially.  After a second viewing I was better able to appreciate the odd sensibilities of the flick and the drastic tonal shifts.
If you enjoyed Kick Ass, I can't imagine you hating Kick Ass 2.  Like the original it is genuinely sincere in its emotional content.  It is still infused with a crazy energy and well shot, however where it is significantly worse than the original are a few plot elements used (rather lazily in my opinion) to connect the second and third acts.
The movie also is a tad more reserved with the violent content, nothing that happens is close to as brutal as the original, hell The Wolverine has a much higher on screen body count.  That doesn't mean we're anywhere near gaining a PG-13, but it made the film a bit more fun for me.  A gang rape was among the content cut from Millar's original book.

5205887,5,B0090JBD8A,"Kick-Ass 2 was a strong, hilarious, and original sequel! It is, in my opinion, just as good as the first...They kept the feeling of the first movie while adding new twists and turns. I could not stop laughing throughout the duration of the film!",1376611200,5,245,4.590909090909091
5205888,4,B0090JBD8A,"Kick Ass 2 will probably disappoint a lot of people who, like me, loved the original to one degree or another. There are just too many flaws in this film to not, at some point, feel a little jilted. There are many times when it matches the greatness of the original film but as a whole this film comes nowhere near the level of ass kicking awesomeness we all fell in love with just a few years ago. It's just not as well made, and doesn't have the same love and attention it seems to me as the first movie. To make a comparison, this is The Dark knight Rises whereas the first movie was Dredd mixed with Iron Man. It even has the same kind of big nonsensical finale. That may not sound like a bad thing, after all a whole lot of people (not including myself) loved Dark Knight Rises, but for a movie like Kick Ass 2 the overly long and convoluted plot and wishy washing direction put a damper on this film. Like Dark Knight Rises, most of the movie is spent trying to get both our main hero's back into their costumes and doing the things we all wanted to see them do in the first place. First Hit Girl is a hero and Kick Ass is out. Then Kick Ass is a hero and Hit Girl is out. Then both are out, and then they're both in. Come on, was all that really necessary? I mean you have two much liked, well established ""super heroes"" already here, there's no need to spend almost the entire movie with at least one of them out of game entirely. What I wanted more than anything in this film was to see Hit Girl doing her thing like she did at the end of the first movie, but nothing she does here comes close to the jaw dropping action sequences she had before. Don't get me wrong, what she DOES get to do is really cool, but there's just not enough of it.

What saves this movie from a three rating is that, for all its faults, there's no denying the huge grin I had while watching. Hit Girl may not have that huge action sequence that steals the show like in the first movie, but as I said before when she does don the purple jumpsuit and whips out her swords what follows is always a treat. Kick Ass doesn't get as many big action scenes, but he's always been more bumbling sidekick ""super hero"" then the Batman like ninja assassin Hit Girl is. His action scenes fit his character, and are a lot of fun in the same manner as his fights in the previous movie were. But who really steals the show is Jim Carry. Nick Cage played a great character in Big Daddy in the last film, and it's a real shame he died as he would have been great to have here. Fortunately for us, we have Jim Carry to take his place. I never would have imagined Jim Carry could have pulled off a role like this, especially after the long absence from notable films he's had. Jim Carry owns his role as ex mafia enforcer, and new leader of the Justice Friends super group, Colonel Stars and Stripes. The crazy grin, the way he gleefully peruses criminals and even trains his dog ""Eisenhower"" to bite off the dicks of pedophiles and human traffickers, all come together to make one of the more memorable characters in the entire series. If not for the trailers I wouldn't have even known it was him until his demasking.

SPOILER!!
It's a real shame they killed him off, like they did with Big Daddy, but I understand the reasoning behind it. This isn't the ""Colonel Stars and Stripes"" show with Kick Ass and Hit Girl being background characters, this is Kick Ass, and you can't have Kick Ass being upstaged by Jim Carry.
END SPOILER!!

The main villain, mob boss son Chris D'Amico from the first film makes a return as The MotherF'er, a whiny ""super villain"" who's only claim to power is a fortune he inherits when he accidentally kills his mother which he then uses to buy an army of super badies with comically racist names. The villains can be fun at times, but there are just too many of them and none of them get any sort of attention besides Mother Russia who's pretty much the female version of the Russian from Rocky III. Other than her though, it's pretty slim pickings when it comes to memorable villains. Sure they do bad things, but besides the before mentioned Mother Russia none of them do anything of note to make them stand out. There was a short guy, an Asian guy, a black guy, and that's about the extent of their characters. Funny names, no personality. As for MotherF'er, he has his moments but again its nothing special. In fact the director seemed to go out of his way to make this guy as whiny, emo, and annoying as possible. He wasn't bad persay, he just wasn't good either.

If it sounds as if I didn't like this movie, trust me, that isn't the case at all. Even for all its problems Kick Ass 2 never bored me. My eyes were glued to the screen for its entire run time, and I can honestly say I had a blast watching it. Sure it's full of corny one dimensional character, plot holes, and is at times sloppily written, but at the end of the day this is a fun as hell movie that should please the inner nerds in all of us. It's not as good as the original, that's for sure, but for what it is it still manages to deliver hours of fun.

Replay value: moderate.",1376438400,4,5145,4.229908443540183
5205889,5,B0090JBD8A,"I received an invite to this movie from Universal and rearranged my schedule to make sure I could get to the theater early enough. I arrived with about two hours to wait and there were about 40 people already ahead of me so I knew I was going to get into the movie. Let me just start by saying, it was well worth the wait if you're a fan of the original.

Let me say right now there are spoilers in this review so don't read it if you don't want to know any of this.

Obviously most of you are aware that Chris D'Amico / Red Mist is the Main villain in this film but, he's taken on a new identity known as The Mother F****r and his getup consists of his mom's old bondage outfit. Well his main goal is to make Kick-Ass pay for blowing his dad up. Of course, his mom is holding back his ambitions so, he had to kill her to get her out of the way; once that's done, he begins to form his evil posse known as the Toxic Mega C**ts.

Kick-Ass approaches Hit Girl about training him and forming a team and she agrees as she has been skipping school and training everyday since her dad died. Unfortunately, Marcus (her legal guardian) finds out and reminds her that her father's letter wanted better for her so, she backs out of the deal and retires Hit Girl.

Colonel Stars and Stripes has already begun forming the team Justice Forever; His team would become the new partners for the man that inspired them in the first place... Kick-Ass!

Uncle Ralph took over the family when Chris' father was killed. In an attempt to dissuade Chris from forming his posse Uncle Ralph has Chris' only friend killed and this lesson is not lost on the MotherF****r as he learns to hurt Kick-Ass, he has to hurt those closest to him.

So, the basic plot of the movie has always been revenge against Kick-Ass and this revenge starts with the death of Colonel Stars and Stripes, the Beating of Night B***h, and the Death of Kick-Ass' Father. Of course, the ultimate goal is to break the inspiration that is Kick-Ass by killing him, cutting him up, and feeding him to sharks (that's the plan anyway).

Through most of the Movie, the MotherF***r and the Toxic Mega C**ts are wreaking havoc on the city and terrorizing the police. To say the least, the lack of Colonel Stars and Stripes has made Justice Forever a little bit weak and the lack of Hit Girl makes matters even worse.

My only real gripe with the movie is that they made Todd an even bigger idiot than in the first movie. Everything else about the movie was great and I really enjoyed it.

Believe me, if you were at all a fan of the first movie, you're going to love this one! It was at least as good as the first and maybe even better but, all I can say is that I really liked it a lot.",1376265600,42,2724,4.233140655105973

5206015,3,B0090JBD8A,"What I can't comprehend is why Hollywood ALWAYS has to beat-Up on the main characters. HIT GIRL is obviously a well trained one 'man' army---she can decimate 20 men in seemingly 20 seconds---but when it comes to the Main villain...she gets her ass handed to her on a platter. C'mon directors---why does someone with Hit Girl's stature & talent---have to suffer with repeated blows ONLY to rise at the very critical moment & win ??? LAME, LAME, LAME...same baloney as James Bond, and ALL the other Hollywood crap...a STOOPID formula they have GOT TO STOP. There were some funny moments in the film, like the cheerleader tryouts & school cafeteria scene---other people may Object to what happens as Gross & Tasteless...but that was Perfect, in my book. I really thought Hit Girl was going to OBLITERATE everyone in the previous scene when she was embarrassed in the woods---ala CARRIE style...but evil teenagers are MORE devastated by their peers by what happened. Another area of contention I have is the miss-directed violence....severe violence was in places it Shouldn't have been ( like the back alley PIMP scene & Mother Russia killing innocent policemen ), but in others that DESERVED MORE violence---like revenge on Kick Ass's father's killers or Mother Russia, herself----Nothing...In the first film, Kick Ass got beat Up a lot---but here he was TRAINED by Hit Girl...and was still a wimp. Yeah, they made it a point to show off his one-hand chin-Ups & muscular body---but he should have done some EXTREME damage---Nothing. And just one last wish...would have been nice if the Cop in charge of taking care of Hit Girl JOINED as a partner---especially after seeing SO many policemen killed for absolutely NO REASON...",1509926400,,1723,5.027972027972028

Still, that's not the film's fault, it had to follow up what was an all around outstanding movie and it honestly delivered on most levels. The core duo of Kickass and Hit Girl deliver on their own, but the companions came in a little flat (seriously, was that really Jim Carrey underacting for once?). I realize the film had a certain direction to follow being somewhat based on the comic source material but I think a lot of the cast more or less phoned this one in. Still, it was entertaining and for fans of the original this should not be a bad film, it's just not as good as the first movie.",1471564800,,690,4.315384615384615

5206152,1,B0090JBD8A,Extremely flawed when compared to the first film- firstly with the 'team' approach there are so many actors added to the cast that nobody gets enough screen time for their character to be explored or expanded in any substantial way.  And the choreography in this film just doesn't match up to the frantic pace of the first one.  At the same time the story is paper thin compared to the first film yet too filled with spineless preachy dialog at the same time.  The script in trying to do too much and be too wide in scope loses all the charm of the first outing. And it wants to be too many things- an action film with not enough action- a coming of age film for Mindy with not enough time or insight or contrast between Mindy the girl and Mindy the hero to make it work; those scenes feel just shoehorned in because the film tries to deal with too many topics and characters in its available running time.  Kickass seems less like a character here and as written comes across more like a shallow clich instead of a fleshed out character. The dialogue has no edge to it as it did in the first movie- it takes more than swear words to make the talk interesting.  If you haven't seen it yet give it a pass and watch the first film.,1471046400,,1229,4.257510729613734

If you liked the first one, I think you'll like this one as well. If you didn't like the 1st one, why would you bother looking at the sequel, right?
Like any ""part 2"" there are those who might say, ""it's more of the same."" DUH. That's like complaining that episode 2 of Mad Men still had that damned Don Draper guy. I hate that complaint, it's the laziest comment one can make about a sequel. Anyway, enough ranting.

5206264,5,B0090JBD8A,"Sequels of successful movies often can be terrible, but Kick Ass 2 is a little different to the original, mostly due to the fact that Hit Girl (Mindy) is now 15 compared to 11 in the first one, and a fifteen year old is obviously going to be different to an 11 year old, but I think the film does well with that, by including her being forced to attend high school (which she had been wagging to keep up her training and fighting skills), and having to deal with a ""mean girls"" type, without being able to just beat her up. It doesn't really make sense that four years later Dave (Kick Ass) is still in high school but you can forgive that for the movie to work. This is also a world where heaps of people were inspired by Kick Ass's appearance and actions in the first film and heaps of vigilantes patrol the streets as superheros. However they don't have the skills of Hit Girl. Mindy and Dave decide to team up and fight crime until Mindy's guardian makes her promise not to and actually attend school, and since Hit Girl's word means everything she must blow off Dave which in the eyes of the other students makes him look like he was cheating on his girlfriend with an underage girl.

Meanwhile Redmist from the first film is now a super-villain who has just inherited a lot of money and is determined to avenge his father's death by killing Kick Ass. His superpower is he is wealthy and can recruit criminals to be super-villains on his team. Dave's going to have to team up with other wannabe superhero's if he's going to overcome this threat. One of those he teams up with is Srubs' Donald Faison another is Jim Carrey who is pretty unrecognisable as Colonel Stars and Stripes.

There's a few scenes such as the throwing up one that could have looked more realistic but the film was still a lot of fun. It would be great if they ever made a spin off with just Hit Girl (or maybe she's have to be Hit Woman now Chloe Moretz is older) or a Kick Ass 3, perhaps Mindy is at university, Dave is in some dead end job but fighting crime in their spare time. I'd watch it.",1464652800,,2072,4.283163265306122

The story line was a little too much about a coming of age type feel and the stars not knowing who they are or what they wanted was a little annoying.  I would have liked to see a little more about the loss of Big Daddy, and Mindy rebuilding her life. I would have loved to see more of Kick-Ass working towards becoming a real super hero.  I would have liked Chris D'Amico to be a little more psychotic than a nonsensical villain.  Hit Girl's fighting style looks too much like a cheerleader instead of a martial artist. What happened there?  Hit Girl kicked ass when she was 11 years old.  She was brutal. She comes off much differently in Kick-Ass 2.",1461801600,,697,4.282442748091603

In this sequel, well, we have high school drama, reality-breaking school bullies, a lower level of puerile, and, well, they kicked the wrong part of the original movie ""up to eleven.""  Not only do we have wannabe villains acting like crazed and unrestrained two-dimensional gloating psychopaths (which makes sense), we have typical high schoolers doing the same?  My suspension of disbelief is strained at that point, and then completely gets broken when, well, the response to bullying defies character, consideration of consequences, and scientific-biologic law.  (Seriously, unless everyone involved in that scene were ALREADY in a bad way, that scene could not have happened.)

The only thing that prevented me rating this movie even lower was, well, even though it was a poor sequel it was still a sequel that reminded me of the original.  And Hit Girl is still fun to watch as she kicks ass.",1449705600,,1160,4.948453608247423

5206814,4,B0090JBD8A,"The first Kick-Ass film was an odd take on the superhero genre with enough grit, humor and action to make it stand out. With all that was going for it there were a few hiccups in my opinion. Kick-Ass 2 does a lot to rectify that. It's a worthy sequel with about the same amount of violence, comedy and crazy choreography as the last film. This time it also has an added level of depth and, dare I say, restraint in the right places that make this film sit better than the previous film. You are still getting the same movie... only more refined.

Movie takes place maybe a few years after Kick-Ass. Dave retired as a superhero, but lots of other costumed heroes have popped up inspired by him. He gets restless not being out there fighting crime so he trains with Hit-Girl so they can eventually become a duo. Mindy (Hit-Girl) has to bow out of crime fighting so Kick-Ass joins a team of vigilantes called Justice Forever. In the meantime Red Mist from the previous film becomes a supervillain to avenge his father's death and creates his own team determined to hunt down Kick-Ass and make him pay. This synopsis glosses over a lot of sub-plots and other various details in Kick-Ass 2. This film actually has quite a full storyline.

Kick-Ass 2 has a number of things that make it stand out from the previous film. First off the story has a lot more happening in it. There is a lot more depth than you saw before. Mindy is growing up, and trying to fit in with a whole new way of life. Dave is learning there is more to being a superhero than he assumed. This film has a lot more happening in the background, and in much greater detail. This level of added dimension to a number of characters give this flick a more mature feel to it, and balances out the mayhem that comes along being a Kick-Ass movie.

Another difference I notice is how the violence is handed out. In the first film you see Hit-Girl mercilessly slaughter her opponents, which didn't sit that well with me since she was supposed to be a hero. This time the heroes in the film have toned down the gratuitous violence. They are felling more under the kinds of superheroes you find in your mainstream comics. Even Hit-Girl limits her ultra-violence to acceptable levels. That is not to say Kick-Ass 2 two isn't any less violent than the first. It's just this time the excessive force comes from the bad guys almost exclusively. This makes a better contrast. Besides the first movie already did all the ""shock and awe"" for us so there is no need to rinse and repeat.

And yes the movie is still very violent. Throats cut, limbs chopped, various people dying in various gruesome ways (like throwing a lawnmower into a car windshield, chopping up the passengers). It's all still there. There is tons of vulgarity as well. Even the bad guys' hero names can't be mentioned without getting Family First in an uproar. Jim Carrey made a point to denounce the film based on the violence, but you know what? It's no worse than the first movie. As a matter of fact I would think it's better since the lines aren't so hazily drawn. More to the point the superhero team Justice Forever makes it a point to refrain from excessive force (and language) along with community service. In other words the contrast between who's bad and who's good is more defined without ultimately toning down the violence that Kick-Ass fans have learned to love.

It's not all great though. There is one scene where the mob tries to teach Chris D'Amico (formerly Red Mist) a gruesome lesson. It made no sense to me. Neither the mob's lesson or Chris' reaction to it. It just felt like some excuse to show some violence and ruthlessness, but it didn't hit home. There aren't many scenes like that in the movie, but it just goes to show it's not perfect either.

Kick-Ass 2 still has room for insane action and quirky comedy. You get observational humor and potty humor. You get witty jokes and slapstick. Some dirty jokes too. Plenty of fight scenes. Since Kick-Ass gets some better training in this film he... well... kicks ass more than ever. The actors get to step up as well. Chloe Grace Moretz really stands out as she gets to explore her character far beyond the tough as nails vigilante. Jim Carrey's Colonel Stars and Stripes has an odd thing about him, but that's what Carrey is good doing. Aaron Taylor-Johnson delivers as Kick-Ass, and this time he gets to stretch his character as well. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (is it me or are there a lot of three-name-actors in this film?) brings on the crazed villain who is both geeky and insane and filled with humorous one liners. Acting is pretty solid in my opinion.

Kick-Ass 2 looks great on high definition. Lots of contrast and the colors stand out nicely. The movie also makes good use of surround sound so be prepared to enjoy. The extras that go with this disk run from okay to really cool:

Commentary - Here you have the three main actors and director Jeff Wadlow tossing a few anecdotes on the film. Nothing all that informative, but it's entertaining to hear the actors out of character all the same.

The Making of Kick-Ass 2 - Four featurettes that make up less than an hour. Upping the Game is about the director's vision of the movie and what he adds to the project. An Ass Kicking Cast is all about casting. Going Ballistic: Weapons and Stunts is behind the scenes with the stunts and the weapons used. Creating a Badass World goes into the design of all the crazy costumes. Street Rules: Showdown at the Evil Lair is an in-depth analysis of the climactic end fight scene. Not a bad set of documentaries, but I feel there is more to be said about the production.

Hit Girl Attacks: Creating the Van Sequence - Three featurettes about the van fight scene with Hit-Girl. Cool behind the scenes look at one of the better fight scenes. They didn't really need to break this one down to three separate parts. Feels like they are trying to fluff the disk content.

Alternate Opening - There was a different opening scene that was filmed. It's very different what you see now, and if you ask me they made the right call. The current opener has more punch to it.

Big Daddy Returns: The Unshot Scene - This is unfilmed footage so all you get is a slightly animated storyboard sequence. It was going to be Hit-Girl having a vision of her father during one of the action scenes, but ended up on the chopping block. Good thing if you ask me. It doesn't add anything to the movie, and only serves to confuse the plot more.

Extended Scenes - These are neat. Some are so-so, but a lot of them add some extra color and depth. I am guessing the Kick-Ass 2 Extended edition puts these back in the film. One of these days I would like to see that.

All in all Kick-Ass 2 is a better movie than the previous one. This is one of those instances where the sequel outshines the predecessor, and does so by making a deeper and more refined movie. If you enjoyed Kick-Ass you will love this film. If you thought Kick-Ass was okay you may end up liking this better. If you are into superhero movies and never seen any of the two films you should have trouble jumping right in without seeing Kick-Ass.",1422835200,5,7178,4.486217457886677

The story is interesting and complex enough to keep you enticed, and the addition of Jim Carrey makes it all the more awesome.

There isn't QUITE as much action as the first movie, and sure, you don't get to see a little girl beating up a bunch of henchmen anymore. LOL!!! But the message the movie portrays is quite profound, and it really makes you think about life in a different angle at the end. It portrays what people probably would feel if their parents were both dead and they had nobody to take care of them. It's a messed up world out there and you have to find some way to survive. You have to take the pain of losing loved ones and turn it into something good, just like Hit Girl says. That's something that everyone should follow.",1414022400,,941,4.286516853932584

5207145,2,B0090JBD8A,"If there's anything we can rely on, it's that Hollywood knows how to destroy a good thing, and this movie is proof.

It's not a bad movie, per se, but it sure took a detour from what made the first movie fun to watch. They should have named this movie ""Hit Girl Meets Mean Girls"", because a good portion of the movie focuses on Mindy's ""adaptation"" to school. Boring, cliched, and completely unnecessary.

The movie's direction is horrible, because too much was going on too fast, but none of the material was played out as to actually care.

For example, we're given a few new characters, but they only talk about their history for about 30 seconds. That's it, and it's pretty hard to find a reason to care about these people because of it, and that they're only onscreen to act as hero fodder.

There's another scene which we get to meet a potential new arch-nemesis (3rd movie?), but the inclusion was so far off the movie's main path that it's painful to witness, especially on how the scene concludes.

I can't discuss another element of the movie without spoilers, so I'll just say this: be prepared for anything and everything, because this movie was too far over the top from the first, that it might as well not have been made at all.

5207271,2,B0090JBD8A,"I loved the first Kick-Ass film. It was such a great and original story. Of course when I heard that due to the success of the film the writers of the original story went to write a second graphic novel, that says a lot. There was no doubt that a film would soon follow based on the new material and now we have Kick-Ass 2...which I am sorry to say does not pack the punch that the first one does.

I don't know why but in this new installment I just found everything about it to be forced. The on screen chemistry of the characters doesn't work as well as they did before. The whole Mean Girls element involving Hit-Girl in high school is pretty dumb. The worst part is Christopher Mintz-Plasse is such a whiny little annoyance in this film and makes a terrible super villain. Even the parts that I thought would be high notes to redeem the film ended up being mediocre at best. The biggest let down for me had to be Jim Carrey, the trailer really over-hypes his character and in the film he really doesn't come off as what I anticipated him to be. Kick-Ass himself doesn't really seem to be as great a presence as he was in the first film and neither does Hit-Girl. John Leguazamo on the other had did a great job in this film. Known for being a goofy comedy star, he really put on his big-boy pants with a more fatherly character to the main villain and I really liked that.

As far as I am concerned this was such a horrible let down. After such a great achievement we get next to nothing for a follow-up. I know that there is a third graphic novel out there now, but will we get a film adaption? Based on this film...I am not going to hold my breath.",1404345600,,1655,4.184952978056426

5207275,4,B0090JBD8A,"Somewhere in the first act, Chloe Grace Moretz -- who gives another fine performance as Hit Girl, and would you expect anything less? -- says something like, ""Yeah, I'm only 15.  But I've done a lot more than most people three times my age.""  Sure, I'm paraphrasing a bit, and sure, the quote is probably a little off.  But  I would say that her quote is not only correct from her character's perspective, but it's also correct from her personal life as well.

If you take a peek at her filmography, you will quickly see that she's been acting for at least 10 years now.  And that wouldn't be too impressive, but only if you forgot the fact that she's only 17 now.  She could quit acting today and still have starred in more films than most actresses.  And acted well.

And while this may not be her greatest performance, it's certainly solid again.  Like I've written ad nauseum, you can almost guarantee that the second film in a series is almost always the worst, and while you may argue that it holds here, it doesn't matter much; the first film was so Kick-Ass that, even if the second was only minor-Kick-Ass, the second was still, well, Kick-Ass.

I loved the humor in this film.  Sure, there's lot of violence.  Sure, there are more than enough swear words to go around for a lifetime.  Sure, this film is not for everyone.  But just like Quentin Tarantino has done -- particularly in the latter part of his career, as I didn't like his earlier stuff myself -- this film is over-the-top enough to let the audience know that this is not to be taken exactly seriously.  This film is meant to be funny, and it is meant to be a fun ride.  And it is.

The critics didn't much like this film, but that was probably due to political correctness most likely.  Because of those reviews, I waited at least a year to see it, when it was on ""free"" TV.  And now, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.  I should have ignored those reviews, gone with my gut, and made that purchase.

While this film couldn't possibly match the refreshing surprise of the original, number 2 definitely still kicks butt.

While the dark humor and wild action scenes are still in play here, the story evolves nicely to cover the aftermath of the first film. This one has a car chase that rivals some of the finest in any action film (despite some choppy greenscreen at points) and some gut-busting jokes involving the pathetic bad guy. But despite the easy low-brow entertainment of regular people trying to be heroes, the film still manages some intelligent discourse on heroics, morality, identity, ambition and fame. Two of the subplots - Hit Girl goes to high school and the origin of the ""real"" world's first supervillain - are smart and entertaining enough to be their own full-fledged movies. But nestled alongside the continuous saga of the eponymous hero, this film will definitely delight fans of the first one.

This movie can't decide how seriously you should take it. It fails horribly as a drama and is very weak as a comedy.

The first Kick-Ass felt very much like a comic book about comic book nerds. It had some serious moments, but was mostly a comedic perspective on how practical being a superhero really is.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) delivers the only consistent acting in the whole film and it is completely wasted by the paper thin characters and predictable plot.

The one thing that made this worth 1 of the 5 dollars I spent on it is the one liner delivered by Hit-Girl at the end of the last action sequence. And it is far too vulgar to quote in a public forum.

Jeff Wadlow (the Director) managed to pull better acting out of the cast than the story warranted. Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a good job with the title role, and Morris Chesnut plays a believable Dective Williams (although I think his character deserved a bit more screen time). Garret Brown gave an incredible performance as Mr. Lizewski (Kick Ass's dad).

However, this film really should have been called ""Hit Girl and The Bad Guy Whose Name Amazon censored"" -because that is who it really was about. Cloe Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintz-Plasse absolutely killed it with thier performances -both as their respective ""super"" and ""real-world"" personas.

too.  Not quite believable was Mindy's trauma at being treated like crap by the archtypical ""snotty girls""; why would somebody
who's life involves walking alone into a building full of killer thugs, slaughtering them all, and jetpacking to safety free and clear
give two craps what some breeze-brained high school bimbos thought or did?  But the writing did set up her attempt to ""be normal"",

Most negative reviews from fans was that it wasn't the same as the comic.  I'm a huge comic book fan (have a collection of 5,000 plus) and I understand when comic book movies aren't the same as the comics.

The only three movies that come to mind that were really adhere to the source material were Sin City, 300 and Watchmen (loved all three).  Unfortunately some things don't translate well to the screen or just can't get past a PG-13 rating (just make it R!!!!) or even an R rating.

One particular scene from the the Kick-Ass 2 comics would've never secured an R rating (MPAA even preemptively warned so).  Not giving any spoilers but if you've read the Kick-Ass 2 comics, you know what scene I'm talking about.

Sticking to Kick-Ass 2, actors and actresses simply age.  Mindy can't stay a little girl like in the comics.  That drew criticism, especially at the end, which deviated from the comics as well.  I loved Watchmen, however it unjustly was subjugated to a lot of fanboy backlash because it was almost panel-to-panel the same, minus what the attack was at the end that still spurred the exact same end result.

This movie introduces a new super villain, there's lots of drama and action, a little bit of love, and some pure awesomeness. It's fast paced, exciting, and it ends well. I can't wait for KA3, and I think most people will be the same. You'll love Hit Girl and Kick-Ass in this one, they're bigger, badder, and better than ever.

5207817,3,B0090JBD8A,"If I remember correctly, the original Kick-Ass was a surprise hit like Se7en. The film was like Taxi Driver of comic book genre. With such unforgettable characters as Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, the film was meant to be shocking and entertaining at the same time, whether you like it or not. And perhaps most importantly, Matthew Vaughns (dark) action comedy is based on a one-time-only premise about an ordinary high school boy turning into a self-appointed crime-fighting hero.

Now, after three years Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit-Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz) come back. So does vengeful Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) from the original, formerly known as Red Mist, who becomes a super-villain (and his new name cannot be written here). Some new characters are introduced and among them Olga Kurkulinas Mother Russia is very impressive, almost stealing the show.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to come up with an interesting story. The idea of Mindy Macready or Hit-Girl trying to fit in a high school does not interest me simply because the result is too obvious. The same can be said about the vigilante group led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey with a special make-up), which Dave Lizewski or Kick-Ass joins in.

Not that Kick-Ass 2 is a terrible film. Shaky camera aside, director Jeff Wadlow did a decent job of creating several nice action scenes. But if you are looking for the originality of the first Kick-Ass, I think you will be most probably disappointed.",1393718400,2,1498,5.08130081300813

You still have this underline plot of good regular people being ""super heros,"" but there was a lot going on in the plot. The film just didn't know what it wanted to be; a teenage mean girls plot, revenge, absurd Quintin Terintino style violence. I totally saw what they were trying to do, but really failed.

The chemistry between Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chlo Grace Moretz is good; funny and real. Jim Carrey was great. I only wish he was in the film more.

After a fast and furious start, the film starts to get bogged down by a glut of characters that don't have much to do. While the humor helps, there is an expectation of action and drama in a superhero movie. It does pick up at the end and proves to be a worthy addition to the franchise. After this installment, it would be hard to see a third movie maintaining steam for 90 minutes.

Also I felt the Kick Ass interaction with the less memorable league of super heroes left something lacking.

This time around the best thing going for the movie is, surprisingly, Jim Carrey. Gasp! He actually does a really great job in his role and doesn't do any of his frequent over acting. Sad then that his part is kind of small in the whole thing. Even sadder is that the best thing about the first one, Hit Girl, is now starring in a weak version of Mean Girls. Not only does that not really work for her character but it makes the whole movie feel like it doesn't know what it wants to be in terms of tone and pacing.

Not terrible though, I got through it and only felt disappointed. Go re-watch the first one instead.",1392336000,,738,4.125

The sequel has to deal with the fact that the characters are older, and so it has to attempt to make them be characters you have to take somewhat seriously. You now have a 15-year-old wiping the floor with guys 4 times her size, only this time you have to consider her as a person, too, and in that the story gets better but the character of the movie has to change. The rest of the movie was still as idiotic as the first one, but with the real story developing with the main characters, the over-the-top silliness didn't fit anymore.

I found myself wanting one of two things: 1) give me a stupid movie like the first one that made me laugh at its lack of reality, or 2) let the rest of the movie become as real as the characters you're making me like. The old movie stupidity didn't fit with the new movie characters, at least to me.

I hear there's going to be another sequel. It'll be interesting to see what they do to deal with the tension between a realistic super-hero called ""Hit Girl"" that we're all curious to see grow and the parody-like elements of the first and second movies.

It had an unusual quality and personality that separated it from almost all films of that genre. It was memorable and could have joined the Swedish ""Girl...Dragon Tattoo"" in status. Kick Ass 2 with a different writer and director ruined any opportunity at sustaining that legacy. In place of difficult practiced performance and action scenes we were given the alternative of countless nauseous brief & changing camera angles as a cheap substitute. Thus, creating a just not believable (almost laughable) illusion of action. Even the helmeted sub for Mindy on a hot bike came off as a gratuitous cheap stunt trick. Another cheap prop was her electronic device creating a not believable vomiting/diarrhea CGI scene. Having Mindy go through the teen H.S. romance scene was a tiresomely clichd plot hook designed to bring in the monied Disney-like audience for the producers. The excessive profanity/obscenity ridden dialogue was another cheap pointless filler for having to come up with a creatively meaningful story.

One of the biggest surprises to me a couple years ago was the first movie KA. I didn't know much about the movie at the time and only had seen some of the brief highlights from the trailer. Frankly at the time, I didn't have high expectations as it looked a bit ""hokey"" but I watched it and I thought at the time this was one of the sleeper hits of the year. KA had it all, action, humor, and a great story with good actors. The first movie was outstanding, which I don't give high praise often to most movies but the original deserved it as it turned out an original ""superhero"" story that was unique in a lot of ways.

Then comes the sequel and unlike the original KA I had high expectations for the follow-up. Unfortunately KA 2 has a lot to live up to in my mind and like most sequels falls a bit short of the original. Nothing against the movie, but unfortunately for it, it loses the originally that the first one had simply by being second. Unfortunately there is no ""Big Daddy"" appearance by Nicholas Cage, not even in a flashback, which is a shame but Jim Carrey does an outstanding job at being Colonel Stars and Stripes. With the acting and the makeup job he is almost unrecognizable but not in a bad way. I am normally not a Carrey fan, but I will give him credit, he plays the role and plays it well, with less of his typical spiel he does in most of his movies. The movie takes a bit to find its footing I think and starts off a bit slow with ""Hit-girl"" not wanting to be ""Hit-girl"" and ""KA"" well trying to talk everyone into joining his band of crime fighters. But once it does, the action and the story picks up and gets better as time goes along, you have to give the movie a bit of time to get going but once it does, it does a good job at keeping you entertained until the end. A decent story, not as good as the first, but with the addition of some of the villians, especially ""Mother Russia"" the movie finds a way to make you like the characters good and evil. Will there be a sequel, that remains to be seen, but it would be a shame to not follow up with some more of the gang finding new villians to fight.

Maybe it doesn't live up to the original and takes a bit of time to get going in the story, KA2 is decent and if you are a fan you will love it. 3.5 stars.",1390694400,10,2497,4.102249488752556

5208347,2,B0090JBD8A,"Not since The Godfather have I seen a movie that features scene after scene of such wanton cruelty.  Sure, there's plenty of the usual blood & guts violence (e.g. mugger gets knife shoved through foot, bad guy takes baseball bat to crotch) that was in the first movie, but there's a level of true sadism here that wasn't present in the first.  There's a difference between comedic violence (see: Kill Bill, part 1) and what goes on here.

Warning: spoilers ahead

High school kids are often cruel to each other--that's no shocker.  What was surprising here was just how matter-of-fact the cruelty was.  Dave's girlfriend walks up to him and tells him, point-blank, that she's having sex with someone she volunteers with.  Mindy is the object of a mean prank where she's abandoned by her ""date,"" left in the middle of nowhere.  Fortunately, she gets back in a rather satisfying way that is one of the movie's few bright spots.

In the first movie, the actual violence was mostly comic--bad guy takes bazooka to face.  In the sequel, Dave's father is murdered in jail--hanged with his throat slit--and Dave finds out via the most graphic text message I've ever seen.  Chris D'Amico kills his own mother (presumably by accident).  One of the team of good guys is murdered while his dog watches.  A child pimp gets his genitals chewed off by said dog.  Chris D'Amico threatens to rape Dave's new girlfriend--just for fun.  Chris's crime lord uncle orders a murder and forces Chris to listen to it via cell phone.

Plenty more in the semi-comedic vein, but hopefully you get the point--if you were hoping for a lighthearted movie, you'll be disappointed.  If you expected ordinary movie shoot-em-up violence, be prepared for villains who want to damage people's psyche.  You may be entertained, but prepare to be disturbed in a way that not many movies depict.",1390176000,,1855,4.8164556962025316

Although the first movie was definitely original, the sequel followed the same themes as the first one showing more mature versions of the characters.  This movie is darker in some places than the original, but the first one was plenty violent.

I was surprised how much I liked Jim Carrey in the movie.  After seeing the movie, I was more surprised he spoke out against it because his character and the rest of the group he leads (Justice Forever) actually don't use guns (even his is not loaded).

Make sure you watch until the end of the credits because there is an extra scene once the credits complete.  I didn't realize this when I first watched the movie.  This is separate from the extras in the extended edition.",1390003200,,883,4.579617834394904

It feels forced and shallow. I would put this in the top 10 of the worst films of 2013.

For fans of the original this has to be really disappointing because it feels like a totally different movie than the first. The original had great warmth to the characters, the humor, and an overall mix of a superhero world/real world reality. This one just leaves you cold. I'll try to explain. I felt like I didn't know any of the characters anymore. Even kickass and hit girl which are the main characters felt a bit off. Jim Carrey was one of the best parts of the movie but his role is so minimal that it's almost pointless.

On the topic of the characters, they just introduce too many of them and you never get to know any of them at all. They also throw in too many subplots. The one in particular that was absolutely horrible was the one with hit girl in high school trying to fit in with some dumb cheerleaders. These scenes will leave you staring in shock at what is happening on the screen. So unlike the original. What's left to say? This movie just goes too far over the top and it's beyond being a comic book. The original felt based off a comic book but yet real. This one is just a dumb cartoon.",1389916800,,1408,4.172794117647059

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is what it is - that being a bunch of folks who are tired of bad guys and want to help out. And then, of course, you have your evil villain, who is an idiot, and his army of evil guys.

It was funny, exciting, and just plain out fun to watch.

My thoughts of Jim Carrey, after I watched the movie, was that he probably got pissed off because he couldn't do any of his moronic and sophomoric comedy in this film. As for his character: I thought he played it very well.

This is definitely a ""watch again"" movie.",1389916800,,739,4.041095890410959

Kick-Ass 2 will probably not be the best movie you've ever seen; but sometimes there are other aspects which should be considered, and these should be rated at, too.  An important aspect- in my opinion- is: ""Was it really fun to watch?""  I say that the answer is: ""Yes!""
  For the most part the characters were likable.  The F/X were very good.  The filming was top notch.  The sets were fine.  The acting was very good- or better.  Very good pace.  The script was better then acceptable.  The story could have used a little more meat but they added a lot of outside bits to fill in the spaces [bringing in the father, the super-hero gang, the shark, the teen angst, ...]
  Plot: 2 super heroes.  Both dealing with father and one with the guardian- also, are, dealing with high school and their place in the high school.  One has quit being a super hero and one is doing it in secret.  Then they switch that position.  Basically the main theme is: ""To be, or not to be, a super hero?  Is it nobler to suffer the slings and arrows as a super hero.  Or to suffer the mental turmoil that is to stand on the side lines and 'fit in'? That is the question!""  [This along with VENGENCE is what this film is about.
  Lots of action.  Dump put off some other film that you're dying to see for this; but if you're looking for a fun [non-serious- movie with high entertainment value, this should do.
  Special: both the female villain and hero are the best characters without making them ridicules and over the top.  Finally: The scene with the bad woman taking on the  cops can probably go up against any action scene.",1389916800,,1662,4.308441558441558

Graphic violence and over the top obscenity that didn't work like the graphic violence and obscenity did in the first film. This one had the feeling of kids just learning to swear, or worse, trying to shock an audience that was ready to be rocked, not shocked. You can't shock an audience after what we saw in the first film. Mother Russia massacring those cops was pure violence porn. Not fun. Not cool. Too long.

Even the big fight scenes were campy, and not even close to Hit Girl's incredible introduction at the drug dealer's pad in the first film. That scene was the Bolshoi Ballet.

Maybe it was supposed to be camp. And maybe it did follow the graphic novel (Unfortunately, that's not a big enough audience to make money with a film.).

For some reason this left me wanting something...I respect the direction it went but again I can't put my finger on what exactly it was missing.  It's a fun watch anyway and I would advise to watch it if you want to catch up on the story line and see where it heads.  If they decide to make a third one they could really go anywhere with it.,1389139200,,569,4.18348623853211

The movie was a decent follow up to the original, which surprised me. I don't think the franchise could hold up through Kick-Ass 3 though.

I do have one major peeve about the movie.

Story line is weak, you can guess at what will happen next, but if you've seen part1, this is NOT the same type of movie!!
ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE DIES A GRAPHIC DEATH.
BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD and more BLOOD
Most characters spend their times saying F-this and F-that MF-this and MF-that

1 STAR rating because the same 2 main characters were in this movie and their roles were the only decent roles in the movie, everything else is like a cut-em up and kill-em video game.
Fast paced and full of action, racist comments and full of mass cop killing.
It will leave you wishing you did not watch it and ruin what you thought of the original movie. They must have spent $1,000.00 on costumes - and not much else - very low budget and extremely poor graphics\effects.

5208780,4,B0090JBD8A,"I feel the need to address a small point here.  I'm not a fan of the Kick-Ass comics.  I think they're poorly written, predictable, irritating, violent for the sake of violence and ridiculously juvenile (i.e. like most of Mark Millar's work).  But the movies, they're great.  They take all the good parts of the comics and ignore, rewrite and even make fun of all the bad parts.

The first movie was just great.  Since the beginning it hooked you in and it had some incredibly memorable moments.  Though at times it seemed like it tried too hard to look relevant, it did a fantastic job of making a fun, entertaining and even compelling story.

Along came the sequel, which is made by mostly the same team (but different director) and holds the same cast (well, those who survived) and, in general, is great too.  It doesn't reach the greatness of the first film, but it mostly does a fantastic job too.  I'm not a suscriber of the opinion that sequels can't surpass their predecessors, but this one sadly doesn't.  And it's mostly because it doesn't manage to avoid some of the pitfalls the previous film gracefully circled around.

The movie starts in a slightly different place from which the first one ended.  Both main characters have grown up, but it seems like the villain has somehow regressed.  Our hero Kick-Ass has abandoned the vigilantism, but it starts it again and he's looking for partners.  Since Hit-Girl is reluctant because her tutor won't allow it, he finds partnership in people he's inspired.  Meanwhile, the villanous Red Mist rechristens himself as the Motherf****r and decides to stir revenge upon Kick-Ass by creating his own group of supervillains.  Hilarity and violence ensue.

First, the good things.  The cast is as great as always, and the newcomers do a fantastic job too, specially Jim Carrey, who's practically unrecognizable under his guise as Coronel Stars and Stripes.  The story of the film is plausible for the universe of these movies, and, in general, most of the characters have very good moments.  This film has also some emotional parts, which are very well handled, and the effects are quite good.  Like the previous one, it relies more on practical effects than CGI, which is great.

Buuuuuut...  then there are things that are not so good.  For instance, Hit-Girl is a great character, but her presence is minimal.  Her alter ego is relegated to what's essentially a Disney high-school drama story for most of the film, which is a spectacular waste of the character.

The pace of the film is problematic too.  Some scenes drag out too long and others are not long enough.  Some things happen for no reason while others don't happen at all.  Like, Kick-Ass just decides at the beginning of the film that he will come back to vigilantism just because.  Why bother introducing him as having left the job when you're going to make him come back two minutes later?  We are introduced to The Motherf****r's uncle as the guy who really runs the bussiness after his father's death.  He does something horrible to the kid and then he gets completely ignored for the rest of the film.  Later, we have one of the most important plot points happening because some guy just happens to show up and blurt out a comment out of the blue for no reason.

The movie also lacks any defining moments, like the wonderful scene with Big Daddy in the warehouse in the first film.  And then, of course, there's the violence.  I have no problem with it, but I understand why some people might think that it's unnecessary sometimes.  It doesn't reach the levels of ridiculousness from the comics, but still, it seems like it tries to compensate for the lack of defining moments with character deaths, which doesn't work.

In any case, the movie has more good than bad moments.  Just like the previous one, it greatly balances action, humor and emotion.  It's just that the flaws are more noticeable and less forgivable this time around.  I still recommend it, of course.  It's not one of the greatest comic book films, but it is still great on its own.",1388793600,2,4073,4.7258522727272725
5208781,4,B0090JBD8A,"Would give the first Kick Ass a five. If anything, I would have liked to see Jim Carrey have a bigger role. It was good.",1388793600,,120,3.84
5208782,3,B0090JBD8A,Just wasn't as funny or catchy as the first one. Overall not bad but not what I was looking for.,1388793600,,96,3.85
5208783,3,B0090JBD8A,"This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be . . . bathroom humor?  Coming of Age story?  Cool Reboot?  I felt that the script wasn't worthy of the original movie, some of the fight scenes looked too staged, and it just wasn't anything more than a nominal diversion. Want a crazy cool movie... watch The Perfect Host. That one will blow your mind.  David Hyde Pierce stars in it.",1388793600,,382,4.414285714285715
5208784,5,B0090JBD8A,"So, glad there keeping the Kick-Ass movie series going. Hopefully, there will be a trilogy. In any case, this movie was a bit more serious then the first one. Also, it may not have been as funny as the first one, it certainly is more action-packed with a growing team of super heroes to help Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl fight crime. Some nice editions to the cast like Morris Chestnut, Jim Carey, and John L. have helped to spice-up the overall value of the movie. In fact, this is definitely not a PG13 movie, so parents be careful! However, the movie is just entertaining and ideal for 18 and up audience.",1388793600,,601,4.472727272727273

5208818,3,B0090JBD8A,"This movie is a bit choppy, moving up and down and has too many over the top moments.  It is not as good as the first and they have made in my opinion minor but unreasonable tweaks to the main characters.  Jim Carrey is billed but has a small role.  The climax of the movie is way too unrealistic even for a B-movie.  Still, I enjoyed it but only from the viewpoint of a B-grade action film with moderate expectations.",1388707200,,418,4.1875
5208819,5,B0090JBD8A,"I can understand how some people don't feel this lives up to the first film, or the comics; I personally feel this exceeds the first and serves as an excellent example of a sequel. Everything is bigger, more ludicrous. My only complaint is the role of Todd. Having not read this comic beyond issue one, it's hard to comment on the character but I do feel it misses something having been recast. He feels a bit of throwaway filler that just happened to have a really contrived moment or two in the film.

The special features are comparable to the first but I'm not sure they're worth the few extra bucks one expects to drop during the first couple months of release. It's worth waiting for it to drop below $20. Were this an uncut edition where you didn't have to select through all the deleted or extended scenes, then it might be worth the few extra bucks.

Bottomline: It's 5 stars for it's escapism, humor, and total unabashed ridiculousness. If I could rate the special features separate from the film itself, they'd be a 3.5.",1388707200,,1031,4.537634408602151

I kept finding myself irritated by something ridiculous a character would do or say, only to find that the other characters were reacting in the same way. I like that; it hints at the idea that most of these characters are a little crazy, and coping with it.

This film does build upon the first one, though, so make sure you see Kick-Ass before you watch #2. It doesn't really stand on its own.",1388707200,,504,4.478260869565218

Not only was he no more interesting than any other character, he was totally unrecognizable, even without his mask.  I only knew it was him because my kid said it was, and because it couldn't have been anyone else.

The story rocked like the first one.  Like I said, I only exected more because Jim Carrey was on the cover.  They don't brag so big about the other actors, they shouldn't have made him special. It just made me expect more.

The high school girls act was done well until the end of it when the kid decided she had to dress like a slut like them, to defeat them.  Staying herself would have made it more meaningful.  It actually made me groan.  This isn't a movie for tweens and making any scene insipid to grab a younger target audience is just stupid and insulting.",1388534400,2,936,4.285714285714286

I think not! Then you have your own actor (Jim Carrey) boycott his own movie!!! Priceless!!! That is a huge sign that this movie was in trouble, it's way over the top with violence and the sex is just stupid. I could hear the creators around the table saying; ""what a great idea to have teenages as villains and Heros. To show how kickass stylist they are lets have them cut school, have graphic sex, and kill criminal with lots of guns and knifes!"" The violence is so Kill Bill, with the shock value and blood.

The characters are terribly written, things happen ONLY because the plot requires them, it reneges on it's message - or whatever message it thinks it has - often and with abandon.  Often the characters remind each other that ""This isn't a comic book, this is real life!"" before engaging in behavior and actions that would only be found in comic books, and without any of the repercussions of real life (the consequences are pretty much the only reason to try and tell a ""realistic"" superhero story).  It's an exquisite mess, and I suspect it wasn't directed so much as pasted together from recollections of wet dreams by frustrated 14-year olds.  On the other hand, you won't see a more polished mess this year.  Also, it's nasty and arrogant and snide.  Just a catastrophe of an ugly, exploitative film.

My main problem with it was its inaccuracy to the graphic novel. My friend is a huge comic book buff so it upsets him.

My other problem was Hit Girl. She was older and fit the part in a weird way. They also tried too hard on the girly girl aspect of her.

It really delves more into the enigma that is Hit-Girl, and we finally see the villain formerly known as the Crimson Mist go full-on bad guy. This time around, Kick-ass receives actual combat training from Hit-Girl, making him more of a threat than he was previously, and Colonel Stars and Stripes aka Jim Carrey has a definite screen presence as team leader, though he doesn't get as much screen time as I would have liked. Overall, the action and humor really make the film, and if you like colorful villains, Mother Russia proves to be the reigning badass in this movie - she's like the female version of Ivan Drago ala Rocky IV.",1388275200,2,729,4.572519083969466

5209234,3,B0090JBD8A,"Kick Ass Two(released Aug/13) stars,among others,Aaron Taylor-Johnson,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Chlo Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey. Has anyone noticed the three main stars use three names for identification? Just thought I'd throw that in there. KA2 unfortunately does not live up to the high standard of the first,then again very few sequels do.
The story finds our two protagonists Moretz and Johnson with a bit of an identity crisis on their hands. Moretz is now living with her guardian Marcus and she is consistently skipping school and keeping in training as Hit Girl. Johnson starts retraining also with Hit Girl but it soon comes crashing down when Marcus discovers the school skipping. She is grounded and is forced to promise not to don the tights again. Johnson is left on his own and hitches up with a rag tag group of civilian do-gooders started by Carrey.
Moretz meanwhile tries to play the typical high school student but,in the end,with the predictable and unsatisfying results we all saw coming a mile away. Johnson,with his new group,has been kicking some baddie butt and seems to be doing alright until one fateful night. It seems Johnson's nemesis Plasse has been planning revenge on him for quite awhile. With his mother dead he has assumed a new identity and has hired a substantial group of real baddies to assist him. That night they jump Carrey at his group's lair,and decapitate him. They then track down another member of the gang,trash her home in the burbs and attempt to rape her. The cops come in swiftly but all are disposed of just as fast.
That night the police track down Johnson's home address and arrest his father,thinking it is Kick Ass they have. While in jail Plasse has his father killed and sends a message to Johnson showing him the pictures. At his father's funeral,Plasse and his gang kidnap Johnson. Moretz is there and,while knocked unconscious during the initial assault,is now up and at them and on the roof of the van. All along Johnson has been pleading with her to come back into the super hero fold but she has refused. This,it seems,is the kick start she needed to return. She rescues Johnson and together,with the help of the core gang and many more recruits,storm Plasse's home for the final show down. The bad guys have their butts handed to them,while nemesis Plasse falls into a shark tank. Initially he thinks he's alright,but soon he goes under and the water turns blood red.
The end has Moretz leaving the city as she has become a wanted fugitive. She hands the super hero torch over to Johnson who continues to train in earnest. In the post end credits there is a brief shot of Plasse in a hospital bed with his legs eaten off,trying to reach a bottle of water. Sequel anyone?
This film concentrates far too much on Moretz's personal crisis and demands of her guardian to act""normal"".She cannot and will never fit in to that environment as that was made plainly clear from the first film. It is the fatal flaw of the film,as they fall back on an old literary device seen in a gazillion films prior to this,but which doesn't belong in this one. The film also has a tendency to flit all over the place and sometimes cannot connect it successfully altogether. Carrey plays a subdued(for him)role and is SO subdued he just doesn't stand out over anyone else. Or is that a case of alot of editing along the way? You decide. The big thing about the first one was Moretz's unbelievable moves. In this film we see her in very small moments throughout the film doing her thing. It is not until the final showdown do we see her doing anything substantial and even then,between cutaways,there is barely over an actual minute of screen time devoted to her fighting. VERY disappointing. Finally,if I heard it once I hear it a gazillion times by various characters in this film,that""this is not a comic book,this is real life"".My gosh,talk about preaching to the audience. Hey producers,try using a hammer next time,it would be much more subtle!
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include some extended scenes,three featurettes and commentary.
All in all a disappointing come down from the first. The script writers shoot themselves in the foot with some old literary canard that has no business in this film and Moretz's fantastic moves from the first are whittled down to precious little. Note to producers:have your writers watch and re watch the first film to find out exactly what made it tick,then and only then,have them write a new and hopefully better and more fitting script. This franchise's core idea is just too good to fritter away on bad writing.
P.S.Jim Carrey gets the condescending disingenuous butt award for his comments post Kick Ass 2. He applies for and gets the part,then the script,films the movie,gets paid and when it comes out he issues a statement saying something to the effect that he does not condone the violence this picture portrays and does not support it. I am starting to see the end of your career road Jim,and there's a sign saying ""Unemployed"" there. Go figure.",1388016000,3,5112,4.777401129943502

She is lifted and thrown on her back coughing straining for breath. Exactly as she was ,again in the 1st movie. The movie is much better the second time you watch it though. The director does not have the chops that MARV does (aka Mathew Vaughn), and the movie suffers for it. The new director Jeff Wadlow just does not have the chops yet. Maybe he will gain them but right now he does not. He has 4 other movies. His ratings on Rotten Tomatoes Range from 22% to a high of 29% the last is the rating for Kick Ass 2.

Kick-Ass 2 has taken the grittiness and the dark undertones of the first movie and really kicked it up a notch this time around. A few moments were surprising, and even quite shocking.

Nothing like that in this movie and honestly some of the plot devices are shallow.,1387843200,,429,4.443037974683544
5209351,4,B0090JBD8A,"Kick ass will not appeal to everyone.  It is a very dark and violent ""superhero"" movie, where the heroes are real people who have no powers which of course puts them in real jeopardy.  The first film definitely had those elements and this one takes that up even more.  There are some comedic elements to this movie, but on the whole probably not as much as was in the first one.  Like the first one however the comedy is dark.

Comic book adaptations of movies are always hard, because you want them to strike a balance between telling the story of the comic, but not always being locked into everything the book does.  I have not read the comics, but I know just in terms of the timing of how the movie sets the story vs what the comic did there are a lot of differences.  So those who would be disappointed that the movie does not follow lock step with the comic, probably want to avoid the movie.

Unlike the first movie which really set up a second movie well, this one ends so that the franchise can either end with it, or continue on.  In the bonus material it is more than once strongly hinted that there will be a third movie.  On the whole I would say that this movie is not as original as the first, but that is to be expected.  I would say it is as action packed as the first though.  It is very violent, with a lot of bad language and a little bit of nudity, so if those things turn you off to a movie you will want to skip it as well.

For those who get the disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  If you watch the extras, there is about an hour or so worth of material from deleted and extended scenes, a making of feature and behind the scenes bonus material.  Definitely enough there to make the people who like going through the bonus material happy.",1387843200,2,1779,4.1608187134502925

The way they handled the growth of the old characters and the introduction of the new characters was a joy to experience. I highly recommend this movie. I used to respect Rotten T but their critics of choice have fallen prey to the snob factor - basically they watch to many movies and lose sight of a good catchy original super hero concept.

I give one star to the crap critics. Elysium got 69%? it was overhanded garbage. Kick-Ass2 gets 29%? These guys get a cut of the budget if you know what I mean. Shameful.",1387756800,,682,4.3700787401574805

The villains became comical stereotypes rather than brutal mafia and we were faced with a Hit Girl who gave warnings after a modest beat-down. Did the villains commit murder, sure, but they were cartoons. They were allowed to commit over-the-top murder because we knew the cartoons would get theirs.
The film was obviously toned down because the producers realized their target audience were teens and that teens have parents and special interest groups who bray on about violence, etc. Also, teens like sparkly vampires and revenge on the bullies at school. The vampires were not doable no matter how much they stretched it, on the other hand the less than lethal comedic weapon for some light bully revenge was.

This film however is as though the director was too afraid too keep some of the original politically incorrect material from the comic book. It is darker but also not in a good way. there is only one scene shot at night and its not even a good scene. I feel that when the villians went on a rampage it should have been at night. Most of the action comes off as goofy over the top nonsense. most jokes fall over dead and beg to be taken to the morgue and buried, but no, the director pics that dead joke up and tries to make it work. For instance the shark ""joke"" does not wrk at all but the director decided to keep kicking it until it just makes yu sick. oh yeah the sic stick. Come on really. The original film based all its weapons and tech on actually things that excist and can be bought. This film just makes up junk and says hear eat this puke. Its funny eh?...its funny right?...hahaha its funny to me the director who cares what the audience wants. yeah ok jim carrey is in it but for reasons unknown... Wait hes in it to make the audiance go hey jim carey. Kick ass is wearing big daddys armour and the director didn't even give a logical explanation to why hit girl would let him wear it. The armour is in a glass case kinda like a fallen samurais armour. ok that bit works but why is kick ass wearing it. Hit girl mindy carries this movie on her back and makes it work hats off to the actress. Kick ass does not do much in this film. He kinda sits back and lets hit girl run the show. There are elements that work like the bad guys. But there is no real motivation for why the bad guys are following chris. Other than money. If you want to see kick ass 2 and don't want to ruin the experience of the fist i sugjest buying the comic book. If you must see this movie rent it first. This movies core is the core of the original the entire story could have been thought through better.

5209439,5,B0090JBD8A,"Kick Ass is a wonderful comic book series turned movie series about people who want to stand up for Justice in the real world by putting on masks and beating the crap out of everyone.

Movie Itself - The movie itself, in most peoples eyes, is a horrible movie compared to the original.  I think it's not as good but at the same time it's better because it gives us so much more comic relief than the first one.  It adds more depth to Hit Girl's teen years struggles, which is kind of dumb drama in the movie, and it shows Kick Ass' struggles of staying Kick Ass and joining a real life super hero team.  I also have to add that Jim Carrey deliver the most powerful performance in the movie.  He makes you feel like it's not just a movie by portraying the greatest Colonel Stars and Stripes character you could ever ask for.

Blu-Ray - The video presentation delivered with great detail of color and sharpness.  The only problem is there are times that if your tv is set to brighten up colors then Kick Ass 2 will look too bright.  The audio is only 5.1 DTSHD mixed surround sound which is a step down from the original's powerful 7.1DTSHD surround.  It still sounds and looks great despite its faults.

Extras - There are plenty of extra ex trended scenes, commentaries and more that actually adds to the story.  The best news about the extras, too, is that the extended scenes are even more hilarious than the movie itself.

The Verdict - Kick Ass 2 was masterfully transferred onto Blu-Ray to provide the greatest experience ever to kick you in the balls at your home.

5209443,1,B0090JBD8A,"I won't get too specific so I don't spoil anything. But this movie was mediocre at best. The actor's performances were generally pretty weak. Even Jim Carrey's. The main 'bad guy' was less intimidating than his side kicks, whose background stories were minimal. Leading to me giving them ridiculous nicknames, like ""Prison Chick"" and ""Skull Dude"".

The first movie was excellent. I am so disappointed because I desperately wanted this movie to be great too. But it's not. I don't understand how or why people are giving this four stars. You're really telling me this movie was even remotely as good as the first one?

So many of the lines were cliche, forced or cringe worthy. It's not an excuse to say you're trying to do it ""deliberately"", as was implied in the movie. There's a right way and wrong way to do that. This was the wrong way.

The gore in the first movie was a statement, to show that being a superhero would actually be quite horrific. And being a super villain is beyond monstrous. In this movie it felt more like the gore was there as an advertisement to convince young adult audiences to watch. Same with all the toilet humor. I get it, you want to use poo references. Fine.

Mindy Macready is the exact opposite: she, too, fought evil, but is forced to give it up after her father's death by her new warden, who just wants her to be a normal girl.  But neither's lives are going to be the same, because Dave killed Chris D'Amico's crime lord father, and now Chris is out for vengeance...bloody, bloody vengeance.

KICK ASS 2 is arguably even more violent than the first.  In fact, Jim Carrey's comments after the Sandy Hook tragedy actually may have some merit (even if it's just another case of a celebrity jumping on a popular bandwagon); some of the violence in KICK ASS 2 is wholly gratuitous and over-the-top, at times so much so that it's off-putting.  But, of course, you should already know that going in.  All said and done, it's still just a movie, one with a thick sense of humor (albeit extremely dark humor).

Returning cast members Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are in fine form (even if the film's plot has Hit Girl hanging up her cape for a bit; she's sorely missed in the film's middle section).  Morris Chestnut has a lot more screen time, thankfully.  John Leguizamo is a welcome addition, as usual.  And Jim Carrey, despite disowning the film, gives a fantastic performance.  In fact, the overall plot is highly intriguing, and the caliber of performances are about as high as you can expect in this type of film.  It's hardly for anyone; and it's certainly slow going until Carrey enters the picture.  But once writer/director Jeff Wadlow (and source scribes Mark Millar and John Romita Jr., of course) begin ratcheting up the tension along with the body count, KICK ASS 2 becomes a darkly enjoyable little action flick.  It's not as good as the first, despite its darker overtones, but it's still gory good fun.  With people in spandex and bondage equipment.",1387324800,2,1985,4.7101449275362315

Kick-Ass 2, however, is an equally superb sequel that continues with what was already set up in the first film.  The first Kick-Ass made for a great opening ""act"", or origins story, with Big Daddy and Hit-Girl being the title characters benchmark to achieve.  In the second film, he has already gotten the ""taste"" for being a ""super"" hero and the inevitable violence that accompanies it.  This was truly an inspiring character piece on two people (Dave / Kick-Ass, and Mindy / Hit-Girl) with almost opposite goals.  Kick-Ass, trying to get back into the hero business, and Mindy, trying to ""fit-in"" an all girl crowd in high school.  Ultimately, they meet somewhere in the middle with Mindy dawning her infamous Hit-Girl costume once again due to an old enemy seeking revenge upon them.  We are even introduced to a super hero, vigilante group known as, Justice Forever.  Of course, The Motherf'er has his own group of villains and team name that I won't bother mentioning here.  You'll just have to check this incredible sequel out for yourselves.

So, this movie's worst mistake is its insistence on making Hit Girl torn between being a good teeny bopper and kicking a** for America's safety.  They waste so many minutes on having Hit Girl worry over her place with her guardian, EVEN THOUGH her father made her promise to be Hit Girl.  Pretty stupid, because Hit Girl would not care.  She's the real deal.  I'm not paying to see the life of a weak teenager.

The second problem with this movie is Colonel Stars and Stripes' short time in the film.  He was the absolute best character in the movie.  He's in and out too quickly.  So is his incredible dog.

The third big dump this movie takes is NOT USING John Leguizamo as a villain!!!!!  What . . . the . . .?  His star never gets to shine.  How could you mess that up?  I would have LOVED to see what kind of villain this character would have become.  In fact, they also gave up a developing comedic relief dynamic by getting rid of him.  Dumb, dumb move.

Other than those three complaints, I have nothing but good to say about this movie.  Why?  Because the other characters are fun, funny, and unique.  The action is way better than the first movie.  The scenes are fun re-watch.  Just great stuff.  Mother Russia vs. Hit Girl.  All I am gonna say.  :)

I love the series and think it tells a fun story with a fun background and the actors are refreshing in a world full of political correctness this movie makes no apologies in the efforts to go against the grain of such correctness however tells a valiant story of what a hero should be.,1386720000,,511,4.3578947368421055
5209630,5,B0090JBD8A,I totally love this. Despite the negative reviews I dragged my wife to go see this in theater because I loved the first one. I was not disappointed! Just a very well rounded film. Well done!,1386633600,,190,4.305555555555555
5209631,5,B0090JBD8A,"I actually didn't really like The original Kick-ass, but gave this one a shot because of the reviews and Jim Carey being in it. I think that this one has a lot more heart to it. More about the characters.",1386547200,,204,4.125
5209632,5,B0090JBD8A,Great movie! Watched this with my husband and we both enjoyed it so much. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed to see that some of the characters were replaced but yet they put in characters that used the same exact name. Whatever happened to saying the old character moved away? Other than that I loved it.,1386547200,,319,4.333333333333333
5209633,5,B0090JBD8A,"It's awesome. It is a well made follow up to the first movie.  Altough not exactly like the previous movie, nor should be, it is a good continuation that any real fan should enjoy. There are new heroes inspired by kick ass' stand from the first film, and many more villains recruited by the Mobster's surviving son.  It has very gripping scenes where you aren't sure some of those new heroes, both amateur and naive or the experienced and skilled, are able to handle and survive the realism of the streets and real bad guys... It gets really intense.  You have to watch.  It is full of surprises, serious dangerous, and humorous situations. It deserves to be right next to the first.

What I like this time was the greater push and reflect on character development for kick ass and hit girl  This sequel includes inspiration from both Hit-Girl and Kick Ass 2 comic story lines.  This movie shows a fun journey for hit-girl where she has to confront being a ""real girl"", high school,  her newly discovered feelings for guys..all the while she and kick ass both have to decided if they are meant to really be heroes or retire those thoughts when things become more threatening.

5209634,4,B0090JBD8A,"Not as Good as the Original. This is true for most sequels though. There must be a fine balance between keeping true to the original and making it stand on it's own. In this case, it seemed like a failed attempt to make it just like the original. The story line of teen anx overriding almost every aspect of life was kind of boring. Some good action, but nothing like the original, especially when it came to fight scenes of the main characters.  Also, the new concept of ""everybody can be a superhero"" was hard to swallow. The Jim Carrey character was implausible as well. Character development and back story is weak almost to the point that it seems they believed the viewer would buy whatever they sold, no matter how pretentious and petty.

The names of superheroes, and especially the name of the arch villain, are great examples of the pretentious and pettiness of this sequel.",1386115200,5,884,4.624203821656051
5209675,5,B0090JBD8A,"I enjoyed movie a lot. Jim Carrey did not agree with the violence in the film so he refused to do any publicity for it. That was probably a factor in it failing at the box office. Mr. Carrey could have waited and voiced his opinion after the movie ran it's course not before it was released. Maybe he could have just came out with a story of being too busy with another project to promote it.  Think about all the people that worked on it. Funny he must have forgotten about that movie called ""Me, Myself and Irene"". Anyways I loved the movie.",1386115200,,543,4.221153846153846
5209676,1,B0090JBD8A,"Not sure this movie rates even one star because the bar was set TOO high with the first film.  And as expected Kick-Ass 2 falls flat on its face.  But I'm not going to bash the director or the acting either because both are at the mercy of the writers and bashing isn't my style.  I don't recommend, if you anticipate something as epic as the original film you'll be let down.  Rent first and then make a decision whether to buy - you've been warned.",1386028800,5,450,4.1976744186046515
5209677,3,B0090JBD8A,"I'm re-titling this Kick-Ass 2: In Search of Rational Characters. It's exciting. There's a real sense of danger, mostly because the filmmakers ignore genre conventions. But this is very much a plot-driven exercise held up almost entirely by one actress.

Since the first Kick-Ass, the eponymous superhero has hung up his cape. For about ten seconds. Then he joins a superhero crew, eventually facing off with a foaming and frothing Christopher Mintz-Plasse who took the death of his father from the first film rather personally. In between, Chloe Moretz alternates between killing people and attempting to be normal.

This isn't a bad film. It's just not exceptional like the first one. Everything from the music to the camerawork is a little less inspired. In Moretz's first appearance three years ago, there was a frenetic, childish background number that elevated the WTF-factor to eleven. Here, it's mostly just generic score, a sort of indifference that mutes the action scenes. The two most compelling (including a Matrix-style highway melee) still trump the outlandish CGI carnage from most movies with 'legitimate' superheros, but there's nothing here with the emotional impact of Nic Cage's video ransacking, Moretz's night-vision rescue, or the combination of Elvis and a minigun.

Partly to blame is the lack of an emotional core and a strong villain. Cage anchored the first film. All the violence was in service to his injustice. There's no equivalent here; Jim Carrey isn't onscreen long enough to play the role, and no one else has a compelling motivation. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is only back to crime-fighting because he's bored, and his adversary isn't a black belt mob boss with a business to run, but a decidedly unserious teenager in BDSM gear. All the minor characters are caricatures; the major ones are internally inconsistent. Why would a guy call the murderer of his relative 'dude' and then start lecturing him about 'real life'? Why would a girl who thinks nothing of amputating limbs be hurt by the rejection of someone she doesn't respect?

Wild tonal shifts swirl into that morass. Very few people actually died in the first Kick-Ass that weren't generic baddies. In this one, the script indiscriminately offs cops and sympathetic secondary characters. Then we get jokes about impotence and dead sharks. Explicit violence lends verisimilitude to some scenes in the middle third, but that's out the window by the end; guns disappear whenever the script calls for ten minutes of physical beatings. The final fight resembles the brawl from The Outsiders with more colorful costumes.

Caveats aside, Moretz carries the film. She's stellar, vastly better than the writing. On the other end is Mintz-Plasse, who the producers apparently told to chew the scenery, vomit it back up, and then swallow it again. His character alternates between insanity and teenage insecurity. I had no idea Carrey was in the movie until I checked IMDB. He's totally unrecognizable and steals every scene he shares with Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

I'm giving Kick-Ass 2 four stars because it was engaging to watch and emotionally affecting. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. But watch with modest expectations be prepared for a little more darkness.",1386028800,,3271,5.173913043478261
5209678,5,B0090JBD8A,I went the movies to see Kick-Ass 2 because I really liked the first one.  I was and am happy to say that in my personal opinion that this was just as fun and entertaining. Of course movies like this one will always get critical reviews regardless of how well the movie is made simply because there are people who get two touchy-freely about kids in rated R movies--Chloe Moretz was more mature at age 10 then half the adults I know!  Looking forward to this movie being released on DVD in December so I can get a copy.,1383696000,,519,4.232323232323233

Like, ""Man of Steel"" got a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than ""Kick Ass 2"". Seriously, that awful, awful movie, ""Man of Steel""!

This was an awesome flick, extremely well-acted and well written, and a fantastic followup to the original. Usually, sequels are terrible, but this movie has escaped that curse. I hope, and bet, this will become a cult favorite.",1383091200,2,600,4.9405940594059405

Hit- Girl (Moretz) wants nothing more then to join them but made a promise to stay away from it. Still bent on revenge Chris D'Amico becomes more obsessed then ever and when he finds a way to get even he jumps at the chance. Leading a gang of super-villains he sets out to destroy everything he can until he finds Kick-Ass. I have to start by saying that I wasn't a fan of the first one. I'm not really sure what I didn't like but it just didn't click with me so I was not looking forward to this one and had low expectations. I don't know if that played a factor or not but this was surprisingly good and I liked it much more then the first one. As a warning (if you want to see this you may not need it) the movie really goes for shock value throughout most of it and is a little over the top, but all that actually fits in a movie like this. Funny, violent and a surprisingly good plot make this much better then the first one and I have to say that I really was entertained by it. Overall, a rare sequel that is better then the original.

Swears like a sailor, acrobatic movements, fast, precise, very professional, determined and deathly, she's a legend and a ghost in the crime world (at least for Damico's gangue) and can show some tenderness when the occasion allows for it. Body count 40 villains including a whore (could be 42). WTF factor = 20/10 (+10 she's a real super hero (like her dad) in a no super hero story, WTF(Dave's expression in Rasul's apartment)?). Fighting crime along with her dad also added her some extra weirdness.

Kick-Ass 2 -> Hit-Girl = Uses mainly a nunchaku, double sided detachable blades, a Glock 17, knives and an adrenaline shot. Swears like a teenager,acrobatic movements, fast, precise, very professional, determined and deathly. She's a troubled teenager, bullied and is stuck under a promisse, she's changing into a woman and starts developing feelings for Dave, which she already showed some interest in KA. In the end she understands she is Hit-Girl and Mindy is only her persona. Body count 10. WTF factor = 15/10 still breath taking though softened up a bit and no Big Daddy this time (I guess I miss Nicholas Cage a lot, he should've done some cameo). Well I believe Mother Russia should be equivalent to ten men.

Kick Ass 2 is great entertainment specially for those open minded viewers that long for something other than vampires, werewolves and Marvel and DC characters (not saying they're bad, they're great actually, just think they deserve some rest so other ideas can also have their chance on the big screen). A bit of a letdown for die hard fans of the First Kick-Ass (who miss the stylish direction of Matthew Vaughn) but nonetheless a great sequel for the most beloved original and if worked ""properly"" (if they listen to the fans) KA 3 would be a great ending to the story.

*Spoiler Alert*
P.S.: The scene where Hit-Girl takes on Mother Russia after the adrenaline shot reminds me of AZUMI where there's a scene in a forest where she moves fast while the ninjas moves in slow motion just to show how faster she is. Also the corridor scene in Kick Ass (1) is similar to the end in AZUMI where she needs to fight about 200 men to get to the ""BOSS"" (Bijomaru). If Azumi had a little more camera work and editing would've been a much better movie. But still good.",1378598400,,2506,4.7015945330296125
5209729,5,B0090JBD8A,"Of course I was excited when I found out Kick Ass 2 was being made. I am a huge fan of the first movie and I couldn't wait to see the next one. Kick Ass 2 is pretty much like the first Kick Ass movie. A lot of action mixed with violence and goofy humor. There is more characters in this film and the action is just as good. Acting wise a few people steal the show from the stars of the first movie. Jim Carrey plays Colonel Stars and Stripes a former Mob hemchman turned masked super hero/born again christian. Now we all know that Jim didn't want to promote this picture b/c of the violence and don't get me started on that and I feel that might have hurt the movies box office performance here in America but I still think he steals every scene he is in. The down point on that is that there is very few scenes with him. Another new character this time on the bad side called Mother Russia is just great. The way she hunts and kills anything that gets in her way truly had the audience at the theater on the edge of their seats. You will leave the theater quoting lines from her and thinking that you wished she was in the movie a lot more. The leads like Kick Ass and Hit Girl are still great in this movie and Hit Girl really gets a lot of character development in this which is a good thing. I have to say I did miss seeing Nic Cage as Big Daddy in this film. I think he really helped the first movie rise to that epic level when he gets killed off leaving his daughter alone and out for revenge,
So as I do not think it is as good as the first movie I think it came very close to it. I hope to see a 3rd and final movie to this series which is hinted as the death of Kick Ass. But who knows.

reviews of kickass 2, very good moive and great acting, to me there was more story and action to the second one, but both are really good movies

5209733,3,B0090JBD8A,"The first Kick-Ass film was a high-velocity, ultra-violent, comedo-drama about real people attempting to be superheroes. It had some riveting action sequences (most of them not for the squeamish), a deceptively straight-forward plot, and a pull-no-punches attitude towards what is often the gooey-sweet sentimentality that action hero flicks often have at their heart. The film was a success.

Capitalizing off of that success, we have the sequel. As is a usual problem with follow-up films, they try to do way too much. In an attempt to either top the original or at least match whatever expectations it may have caused in the audience, the film ironically fails to do either, fumbling as it juggles far too many plot threads.

Our story picks up several years after the original. Kick Ass has inspired whole legions of superhero wannabes, most of whom wander the streets ineffectually in their various, goofy outfits. They eventually face off against a villain whose name I can't type here, played by the embittered Chris, the well-to-do kid whose mafia dad was dispatched in the last film. Overall, you've got a general up-the-ante feel with the good and evil forces expanded exponentially.

However, there's a whole lot of distracting elements thrown in to muddy the waters. You've got both Hit Girl and Kick Ass experiencing superhero angst, most of it propelled by their respective parental figures. You've got a dead-end sidetrack while Hit Girl tries to navigate the murky waters of high school popularity. You've got Chris screaming and moping as he gathers his band of baddies, with an equally dead-end sidetrack to his imprisoned uncle. Add in some fairly awkward jokes, action sequences that (on the whole) aren't quite as impressive as the first film, and deeply (deeply, deeply) schmaltzy dialogue about what it takes to be a superhero (apparently, all it takes is bravery), and you've got a film that feels scatterbrained and overly-sweet compared to its predecessor.

While not without its charms and a few enjoyable moments, and also while not an overall disappointment, the flick nevertheless fails to really kick quite as much butt as the one that spawned it.",1377907200,5,2178,5.109550561797753
5209734,3,B0090JBD8A,"This film picks up a few years later. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson )joins a Justice League of misfit crime fighters. Hit-Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz) has promised to stop crime fighting as she stuffs dollar bills into the swear jar. Our bad guy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has taken on a name not worth repeating. He has started his own league of criminals.

The film is let down. Kick-Ass has taken on the looks and persona of Harold Ramis. The film is filled with awkward swearing, i.e. lines read by people who don't know how to swear. The Justice League of misfits should have been a solid spoof, but instead was written rather lame.

The film had potential. It opened with a re-do of my favorite scene from the first film, but since I have seen that film, the element of surprise was missing, making the scene a bust. Hit Girl as Mindy suffers from teen angst as she fails to fit in with the kids in high school.

The plot was bad, characters were shallow, and the humor was a yawn. Yet there are aspects of enjoyment to be found in the film.

This is aimed at the young adult audience who have to lie about their age to see it.

5209747,2,B0090JBD8A,"I really had high hopes for this movie. I saw it on the very first day it came out, after waiting half a year for it to come out. I loved the first movie and watched it over and over again. Then, finally, it came out and I saw it. What a let down!!!

The movie tried so hard to be as good as the first, but it doesn't even come close to it. It could be that in this movie their was a different director than the first and I do believe that played a big part in it's failure. I thought the movie had a pretty good story to it, but the scenes on how it was done was bad. The jokes were not as good as the first movie either. Also, the acting was really done badly because I think the director didn't help them bring out their skills well.

What did I not like about the movie? First thing, I didn't like was that they keep on showing Big Daddy's costume over and over again. I think I saw it 4 or 5 times in the whole movie! What the point was the point in showing me that costume so many times?  I thought they were going to somehow get again person to use it or maybe Kick-Ass would put it on or something. But, nothing ever happened. It was so dumb that they did that. If the point was to make the audience remember Big Daddy or show that Hit Girl still cares a lot of about her dad wishes, well I got that after seeing it the first time. That was done and done, no need for anymore of those useless scenes. Also, Kick-Ass did put on black body armor at the end, but that wasn't Big Daddy suit to me. Why? Because Bid Daddy suit is different! His belt says ""BD"", Kick Ass's belt says ""KA"". Daddy's wear all black suit. Kick Ass's wear's green and yellow! Mask? BD is all black, guess what, did Kick Ass wear a Black Mask? No, he did not! So, what do we have here? All Kick Ass did was put on any old body armor and that's supposed to be BD suit? I say, HELL NO! If so, then, you're saying we really needed to see BD suit 4 or 5 times just to see Kick Ass put on body armor. It is genius - NOT!

The second thing I didn't like. Why did they have to kill off Jim Carrey""s character, Colonel Stars and Stripes, so soon? If you wanted to do a moment like having Big Daddy characters die like in the first, they should had done it right. When he died it was towards the end and people really liked him a lot at that point but having him died made the movie move forward. Colonel Stars and Stripes didn't needed to die so soon, he could had lived and the message could had still moved the story forward. Up to that point, Colonel Stars and Stripes was the best thing in the movie, and then, he was just gone! I believe the audience really was confused and lost, just as much as the characters in the movie were. Then, I lost much interest in the movie.

The third thing I didn't like. Naming the Super Villains in the movie stupid or racist names. No, it not that funny. Not even a tiny bit. It just dumb what they did. They wanted to force a laugh out of people, but people have to be really low in intelligence to get that kind of humor. I mean really, they could had done much better with the jokes than coming up with ridiculous names.

I could go on with a list of things I hated about this movie, but I won't because there just too many things and I believe I wrote enough items for now. If there is a Kick Ass 3 with the same director, I would NOT watch it. No way, no how.

If you loved the first movie, you will be greatly disappointed with this second movie, and so, I don't recommend this movie.",1377475200,4,3501,3.9715504978662874
5209748,5,B0090JBD8A,Brilliant job and story!! No doubt better than the first!!! But Jim Carrey wasn't one of the main Actors for some reason,1377475200,,120,4.5
5209749,5,B0090JBD8A,This movie is awesome. I love the first movie and the sequel is just as good as the first and the best thing about 2 is that jim carrey is in it. even though that he has a short role he still makes the film. i'm glad that they kept all the original actors in it. I love colonel stars and stripes jim did a great job at him. I thought that the story was good and that all the actors did a great job. I love how they make it realistic like that's how it would be if real people dressed up and played superhero. I just thought that this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1377388800,3,608,3.8333333333333335
5209750,2,B0090JBD8A,"I really liked the first Kick-Ass.  I thought that it made some good changes to Mark Millar's graphic novel and recreated the really fun tale of regular people turned heroes.  When Kick-Ass 2 was announced, I was stoked...until I found out that Matthew Vaughn was no longer going to be involved in the movie (as more than a producer).  Jeff Wadlow wrote and directed the sequel, his first rated R adventure.  So...did it kick ass?

I'll start off my review by saying that Kick-Ass 2's story is an absolute mess.  I'm familiar with the source material, and I know some liberties had to be made with the story for the screen (some of the violence in the book is disgusting), but the characters here seem like that have little to no motivation to do anything.  Kick-Ass gets back into the crime fighting game...because he's bored.  One of Kick-Ass's friends becomes a super hero because...it seems cool.  Hit Girl gets back into the crime fighting game because...she's basically also bored.  Certain characters seem completely forgotten about.  This script is, simply put, a disaster.

There are several really fun, really well done scenes here.  The 'van' scene (hinted at in the trailer) is outstanding.  Mother Russia showing the NYPD that she means business is another stand out scene.  However, the rest of the movie seems entirely forgettable, with the exception of Jim Carrey's charismatic turn as Captain Stars & Stripes.

The direction is competent.  Wadlow lets the action breathe a bit instead of getting up close and personal with the shaky cam that I hate so much, so I did appreciate that.  You can actually tell what's going on.  The CGI blood is a little distracting (why don't we just use squibs anymore?).  The acting is competent, although Mintz-Plasse is even more annoying here than he was in the first one.

Here's my bottom line...going into Kick-Ass 2, expect the following - a terrible story, some cool action scenes, and a ton of dick jokes.  Aside from a handful of scenes, this won't be a movie that you remember in a year.  Hell, you may not even remember most of it as you exit the theater.  It's definitely not as good as the first one.

Final Score: 2/5",1377302400,10,2182,4.73936170212766
5209751,4,B0090JBD8A,"I do not consider myself a movie critic, but I am an avid movie goer and watcher. Sometimes, certain critics will enjoy movies that audiences may not always enjoy and vice versa. Following the release of this movie it has been slammed by critics as "" falls flat"" and ""lacking"". After months of anticipation, i saw Kick Ass 2 today. All I want to say is forget the critics and negative press because this movie is good.

Kick Ass 2 brings back Aaron Taylor Johnson as Dave Lizewski "" Kick Ass""( he buffed up) Chloe Moretz returns yet again and gives a great performance as Mindy Macready "" Hit Girl"". Also returning are Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma, and Christopher Mintz Plasse takes the role of antagonist to the extreme playing Chris D'Amico. New, but exciting additions include: Morris Chestnut as Marcus Williams, Donald Faison as Doctor Gravity, Tom Wu as Genghis Carnage, Lindy Booth as the female hero of the night, and Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes. There are many other supporting actors/actresses, but the actors I mentioned all were great; Jim Carrey, Chloe Moretz, and Christopher Plasse were the highlights.

Ever read those stories about heroes teaming up? Well picture that; only this time bad guys/girls do the exact same. This movie also has a small element from Spider-Man 2 whereas the main hero wants to be normal and put being a superhero in the past. The movie as a whole delivers in terms of action, and relatively extreme humor. I do also feel that the seriousness in the questions:  What is a superhero? or What does it take to be a superhero? is upped even further in the sequel.

Kick Ass 2 does lack the epic feel, or rather classic quality that its predecessor has, but it is NOT a bad movie. It is not nearly as memorable as the 1st, but fortunately despite the minor flaws, it is enjoyable nonetheless. If you love the 1st as much as I do you may not "" love"" this one, but I honestly think you will have a good time. I give the sequel a score of

4 stars",1377302400,3,1998,4.50828729281768
5209752,4,B0090JBD8A,"If the first Kick-Ass movie was your kind of thing, Kick-Ass 2 more than delivers. The first film was more unique and original, but this one gives you even more laughs and great performances by Chloe Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey.

Hit-Girl still rules and it was fun seeing a much larger cast of good and bad characters. Carrey is not in the movie for very long, but he sheds his goofy facial expressions for a realistic and believable tough guy role. He should do more stuff like this. McLovin is much better here this time around and goes from Red Mist to the supervillain with a name I can't repeat here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is once again good as Kick-Ass, but he spends most of the time (like the first movie) just getting beat up.

The violence is a little extreme, but I was expecting more given that Jim Carrey is now against the film due to this fact. Yes it has flaws, but it is a fun ride that had me smiling throughout. Oh, stay after the end credits for a short but important scene.",1377302400,4,994,4.338709677419355
5209753,5,B0090JBD8A,"If you liked Kick Ass you most likely will like 2.  KA2 is a sequel so not as good as the first, but pretty close. Hit Girl isn't the cute foul mouthed little girl anymore.  She is 15 and dealing with high school and feelings.  She is still an awesome butt kicker and is a great character.  Kick Ass is bigger and a bit tougher.  The movie still has all the violence, crude humor and foul mouth stuff that the original had. Funny and action all in this movie.  Stay after the credits and one bonus for me was in the previews where we saw the Bad Grandpa trailer which was funny especially the beauty pageant part.  I was nearly crying.",1377216000,6,635,4.198347107438017
5209754,3,B0090JBD8A,"This sequel's  plot is better than the first movie ""Kick Ass"" because, it was developed from it to include more costumed heroes versus villains!
Eleven  year old version Hit Girl should have her own movies about her as the main character! Maybe constantly changing eleven year old child actresses could be in spin-off sequels instead of about the title's main character ""Kick Ass"" and ""Kick Ass2"" ! Hit Girl's character extreme youthful cuteness factor enhances the comedy and her mutilating and killing criminals made a surrealistically perfect heroine!",1377216000,4,554,5.284090909090909
5209785,3,B0090JBD8A,"""The sequel to the controversial dark action comedy, Kick-A**, brings a new slice of the pie that is surprisingly humorous, occasionally humanised, stylistic, and still very violent and sadistic (more about the brutality later).

Without giving too much away but the scene involving Chloe Moretz playing Mindy, not Hit Girl watching a Union J music video and the scenes involving the cackle-mouthed girls lambasting about Mindy was so hilarious and interesting that it stood out over what are perceivably under-received yet dynamic performance from Jim Carrey (who thankfully decided not to promote the film) and a drive toward rushed action over more enriched storytelling. The same issues with this action vs. storytelling aspect stood out with recent big-budget films like The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and Thor.

It did not have the novelty of the first film nor the shock factor to the highest level of its predecessor but it still sufficed with some humanity in the film with Hit Girl's alternative, high school life and Kick-Ass' troubles with his father. The Hit Girl character is strongly represented here that the film could've almost been called, ""Hit Girl: A Spin-off of Kick-A**"" (an issue apparent with Cars 2 where it focused too much on Tow Mater than the others).

Aside from that, Kick-A** 2 suffers a bit from standing out and timing but it is all an acceptable effort on a more commercialised sequel and makes for fun yet painful viewing with beer and crisps after a football game.""

*PARENTAL WARNING: In regards to the violence, it is just as graphic, sadistic, extreme, and potentially disturbing as the first film but to a slightly less degree given the novelty of the first (no one expected a 11-12 year old girl could kill or curse like that) and excess promotion of Hit Girl as now a cult pop culture icon, in a way. Along with the irony, dark humour, and normalcy of the frequent brutality as well as strong foul language (including the f and c-words), this film is in no way suitable for children especially given the ages or youthfulness of the main characters and stylistic, sensationalistic violence involved. The 15 certificate in Britain was not well deserved, in my opinion, and like its predecessor should've been an 18 due to the violence and themes as one. The filmmakers, from how I perceive it, wanted to make it 15-ish enough by skimming on bloodshed a bit and detail to make it more available to teenagers (who are the target audience for comic books, in which the true Kick-Ass source material is slightly more graphic and disturbing than the films). In addition, the film could be, if without artistic leaning, exploitative or subject to child protection laws with the violence, use of weapons, and perverse content (especially involving a kiss in the end). In all of this, it is a fun film at parts but please exercise with caution!""",1377129600,,2885,4.893660531697342
5209786,2,B0090JBD8A,Just watched Kick Ass 2 today.... Very disappointed :(  went from the pinnacle of Kick Ass to this.... what ever it was 2.... I wonder why Jim Carrey is boycotting it - He was horrible in it & it will kill the last embers of his career. I am truly Kicking my own Ass for watching this (X2).,1377129600,3,290,4.0
5209787,4,B0090JBD8A,"Comics Books, Graphic Novels and more are coming to life it seems like once a month these days. In this sequel, ""Kick Ass 2"" written and directed by Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down, Cry Wolf) this film picks up were the first film left you with a newly banded `super hero' team of basically regular people fed up with the US Justice system, which is made up of kids and  and vigilantes banded together to protect their city.

The super hero `Kick Ass' is back with more motivation than ever to be as good as his best super hero friend (Hit Girl) and is again performed by Aaron-Taylor Johnson (Savage, The Illusionist) who does a great job of showing his angst, ambition and eventual confusion at a major crisis that is forced upon him. His father played by Steven Mackintosh (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Underworld: Evolution) tries to convince him, with a lot of passion and conviction, of doing the right thing but it all eventually leads to one of them making the ultimate sacrifice.

Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer, Hugo) is back as Hit Girl and with the death of her father in the last film and he dilemma with living with her father ex-partner, now her guardian played by Morris Chestnut (Identity Theft, Boyz N The Hood), she is torn between being the person she is - Hit Girl - or the person everyone thinks she should be. Chloe is amazing to watch both as herself and as `Hit Girl'. She could be an X-Men if you ask me!

And of course you good guys like Clark Duke (Hot Tub, Greek) playing  Marty (whose alter ego is `Battle Guy'), Augustus Prew (Charlie St. Cloud, About A Boy) as Todd (whose alter ego is `Ass Kicker') and Donald Faison (Scrubs, Remember The Titans)  as  `Dr. Gravity' banding together with `Colonel Stars and Stripes'.

You also have your bullies and baddies like the snarky and rude Claudia Lee (Heart of Dixie) playing Brook the high school `bi&?h' and of course Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) is back as Chris (and his alter ego Motherf*&?er). Both do their very best to stop our heroes and destroy their personal lives. Add in the element of a `butler' of Chris  with a character named Javier played wonderfully by John Leguizamo (Ice Age, Moulin Rouge!) who gives his character much heart and passion to this truly idiotic example of a super villain.

Now the surprising delight was the addition of Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, The Truman Show) as `Colonel Stars and Stripes' who has a big hart but a desperate desire to violently rid the city of scum and villainy. Jim is obviously have a really great time doing it too and his physically up for the challenge as well. Pretty impressive work Jim!

Overall the movie is fun and filled with action and some great fighting sequences. And you can follow these fighting sequences well because the director chose to use a standard tripod instead of the all shaking, all vomiting, all have-no-clue-who-hit-who hand-held camera style most actions films seem to think is `cool' these days. Most of the action does defy the laws of natural physics, but because you care and follow the good guys, you go with it. Clever dialogue and a big heart make this sequel better than the first for me. Fun, but lots of violence, blood and language!",1377129600,55,3254,4.622183708838821
5209788,5,B0090JBD8A,"I found Kickass 2 just as entertaining as the first film. Filled with action and a generous dose of irreverent comedy, If I didn't know any better I would say John Cleese was giving the director a few pointers. A few scenes reminded me of Monty Python's flying circus in a good way. I was apprehensive at first expecting the movie to take a darker turn just like all the latest hero movies do anymore, but it never did. In my opinion we have enough darkness in real life, we don't need it in our entertainment.
There's loads of action, plenty of blood and cringe worthy moments.

If you go see this movie wait till the credits end, there's a brief Easter egg to be seen.",1377043200,6,670,4.317460317460317
5209789,5,B0090JBD8A,"The first Kick Ass was a bloody romp through a budding superhero's career. This outing follows the titular super hero as he lives in the world that he's changed.

This movie is bloodier, funnier, more action packed and packed with heart. A true GRADE A sequel to an incredible film. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Cannot wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray so I can rip through the making of featurettes that are hopefully included.

If you want an edge of your seat, bloody and wild ride, then go see this damn movie!",1376870400,3,526,4.46875

5209791,4,B0090JBD8A,"Just saw this in the theatre. I liked it. It's great to see a strong, confident, intelligent female superhero who doesn't have to wear skimpy clothes. Actually, I've always thought fighting crime in a bathing suit would be pretty stupid, leaving one very vulnerable. The movie looks at important concepts like the definition of ""growing up""; the nature of childhood; the relationship between what is ""real"" and what it not; the tension of keeping the values of our parents and living our own. Plus it's funny, has satisfying action scenes, has believable and likable characters, and a good plot. The ending was a little bit disappointing; not because it was ambiguous but was just blah, a little dull. Overall, a good movie.",1376870400,4,724,4.942622950819672
5209792,4,B0090JBD8A,"So I saw this at the early showing Thursday night and loved it just about as much as the first one, but I feel this new director didn't take any real risks. Matthew Vaughn took what he read in Mark Millar's Kick-Ass comics and made it his own, where Jeff Wadlow just took what he read and saw in the comics and threw it on screen with only a few changes.
  I like to see movie versions of books or comic books as a sort of a cover song where the person taking from the source material isn't afraid to make some changes. The writers didn't have much to do for this movie because the dialogue is almost word for word what it was in the comics. same goes for the action sequences.
  BUT, luckily the source material is good enough that they were able to put it on screen and make a great movie. Although, I would like to see less shaky cam next time Wadlow.",1376697600,3,854,4.095808383233533
5209793,5,B0090JBD8A,"Being a hardcore fan of the first Kick-Ass, I will admit that I was skeptical about the second movie. Why? A different director and the comic was not amazing...I see now that I had judged too soon! Kick-Ass 2 does exactly what it sets out to do- it gives you an enjoyable, cool experience. I found myself feeling various emotions throughout. I found myself near tears due to laughing, I found myself sad when certain characters were killed off, and I felt pumped for the climax. Chloe Moretz, Jim Carrey and Christopher Mintz-Plasse stole the show with their great performances. Plus, the Mother****er provided many of the laughs.

Don't listen to the critics; this is a sequel that lives up to the original (Maybe better?!) and you should check it out!",1376697600,8,753,4.748091603053435
5209794,4,B0090JBD8A,"Initially, the premise of the Kick-Ass universe seemed like such an arbitrary idea.  After all, who would read a comic book about a bunch of kids trying to emulate comic book characters?  These kids are the equivalent of Peter Parker, only without the super powers, but not unlike Batman - minus the ambition and wealth.  They live in the real world in an unforgiving setting where it would be completely impossible for any of these characters to keep their identities a secret, not to mention live long enough to fight actual crime for more than a day.  In any event, the comic book mini-series was quickly adapted to film in 2010, and Kick-Ass went on to gross nearly $100, prompting creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. to begin work on a comic book sequel, Kick-Ass 2 - which was also quickly adapted to film.

Directed by Jeff Wadlow (Cry Wolf, Never Back Down), Kick-Ass 2 once again stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as David Lizewski aka Kick-Ass and Chlo Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready aka Hit-Girl.  After the death of her father, Hit-Girl is having trouble adapting to a normal life of high school and studying.  But, she makes a promise to her guardian, Marcus (Morris Chestnut) to give up being Hit-Girl.  At the same time, David is bored after having a taste of being a superhero and decides to hit the streets once again by joining a group of superheroes, called ""Justice Forever.""  Still coping with the death of his father, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has revenge on the mind and hatches a plan to eliminate Kick-Ass as payback for murdering his father.  Now working under a new, profane identity, D'Amico hires a group of villains to counter Justice Forever.  It's an all-out war between heroes and villains, and absolutely no one is safe.  Jim Carrey, Clark Duke, John Leguizamo, and Lindy Booth also star in supporting roles.

While the first Kick-Ass film was a bit slow-going at first, it eventually picked-up the pace about half-way through the film, which definitely helped set the tone for the sequel.  With the characters fully established, the sequel had plenty of opportunity and potential - and it most certainly didn't disappoint.  Naturally, in order to enjoy a story like this, you'll quickly need to come to grips with the idea that it's completely silly, non-realistic, and basically a joke.  However, the characters in this sequel do everything in their power to send a message that this film stands on its own merits, outside a world where superheroes can fly, bend metal, or shoot laser beams out of their eyes - and so on and so forth.  At no point during this sequel does it feel dull, boring, or un-entertaining.  The action is relatively constant, and even though the jokes are silly and costumes look like something you'd buy at Wal-Mart, it doesn't delude the quality of the film - unless you simply didn't enjoy the first endeavor.

By far and away, the most enjoyable character of the Kick-Ass franchise is Hit-Girl.  Despite her young age, she steals every scene with her charisma - and Batgirl-like costume, complete with wig and purple motorcycle.  Following her lead is Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who does surprising well as a villain, although he comes off as a bit too tyrannical at times.  If this were a real-life superhero situation, he'd probably have someone twice his size slap him and put him in the corner.  Regardless, his attitude is on par with the character, but his name is probably over-the-line, along with his bondage-based black leather costume.  Finally, it should be noted that Jim Carrey portrays a likeable character, called Colonel Stars and Stripes - with a background as a former mob enforcer.  Despite his disdain for the film's violence, Carrey is actually one of the most violent characters, essentially taking over the role as the elder mentor for Nicholas Cage.

Obviously, the elephant in the room is in regards to this film is focused solely on Jim Carrey and his comments about Kick-Ass being far too violent.  Is Kick-Ass 2 a violent film?  The simple answer is yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jim Carrey was right to criticize this film.  If you're a parent and you watch this flick, there will be a number of things that bother you about it - namely the violence inflicted to and by characters that are portraying high school students - not to mention you will most likely also be bothered by the language being used by a sixteen year old girl.  However, if these issues are such a hang-up, the simple solution is to not watch it.  Kick-Ass is not the only movie on the market with an abundance of violence and abusive language.  American culture is based on the idea of individual choice, and people that are uncomfortable with Kick-Ass should exercise their right not to watch.

Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is superior to its predecessor in nearly every way possible.  There's more action, a more elaborate story, and the characters are given an allotted amount of space to expand their individual stories without focusing too much on one specific storyline.  Even though this film feeds off the success of past comic book film - one example includes a rough reenactment of The Dark Knight Rises' final battle between heroes and villains, the film still manages to create constant entertainment and endless fan boy pleasure.  And, if you can manage to look past the senseless violence, sexuality, and abusive language, you'll find a story that tells an interesting, action-packed tale about kids wanting to be superheroes.

P.S. - Don't forget to stick around for the post-credits scene. Bring on the trilogy's finale.
