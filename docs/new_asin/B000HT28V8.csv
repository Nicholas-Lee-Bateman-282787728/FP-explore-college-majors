2640289,5,B000HT28V8,"For 30$, it's like getting hours and hours of lessons from the #2 golfer in the world since you'll watch it over and over.  At first I was worried that Jim would teach me to take his same unorthodox swing :)  but this video is all short game and Jim's short game is fundamentally near perfect.  Jim and Fred are good instructors and the material is easy to understand and apply.  The production quality is outstanding - this isn't a low budget video, it looks like feature film quality and you can see and hear every detail of the beautiful TPC Saw Grass course.  In the video you actually watch Jim and Fred compete against eachother in a short game match while they describe how they approach each shot and what desicions they make.  Overall I was very please with this purchase and recommend it to anyone serious about the short game.",1160611200,20,837,4.473684210526316
2640290,1,B000HT28V8,"I got this for Christmas. When I tried to remove the CD from the packaging, playing around with it for over 5 minutes, it cracked. Not sure why a cd has to be fastened to a plastic backing so tightly, but oh well, it's really disappointing. Is it just me or has packaging become a huge pain in the neck?",1391299200,,303,4.066666666666666
2640291,4,B000HT28V8,"The short game is where to drop a couple of strokes with a little practice.  The video gave fairly clear techniques on chipping, pitching, and sand shots (putting was in included)",1388880000,,179,4.774193548387097
2640292,5,B000HT28V8,"I enjoyed it, nice easy DVD to watch, picked up useful tips for my short game.  Great to hear their thought process.",1379721600,,116,4.2727272727272725
2640293,5,B000HT28V8,"Agree with the other reviwer in that for under $30 (it is more like $20 as I write this) it is like hours and hours of lessons. Sorry I am not adding anything original here, but if you are new to golf or a mid to high handicapper and are interested in advice, its a great watch.

I would add that if you are shooting under with a hc under 10 I'd bet most of this is more of a review - but would imagine you can still enjoy it.",1289692800,3,426,3.7333333333333334
2640294,5,B000HT28V8,I have purchased a lot of golf videos and this is one of the best. Rather than teaching you how to play it provides multiple scenarios and provides you with several ways to play the ball. If you are looking for help with your short game this is a great video. If you are just getting started buy the golf for dummies book/video bundle and this video. Then take some lessons. As a whole you will always do better with books over videos. The videos move to fast and don't explain things well enough.,1279065600,,497,4.297872340425532
2640295,4,B000HT28V8,This video provides a fun way to finetune your short game. Funk and Furyk are good friends and have fun in the video.  They review the mechanics of each swing as well as how they think through the various shots presented around the green.  I have had the pleasure of playing with Jim Furyk recently and he reconfirmed with me on the course that my handicap could be cut in half or better if I practiced the skills learned on this video (typical of most amateurs). I am going to try and create this challenge match with a buddy somewhere as this would make the practice a lot more fun.  This video is well worth the norminal investment. I purchased a dozen for the people who were not able to play with Jim that day..small consolation prize.,1196467200,2,740,4.386861313868613
2640296,3,B000HT28V8,Just medicore.  Spend your money on David Leadbetters short game video or DVD.  It is much more comprehensive and informative.,1183420800,3,126,5.25
2640297,5,B000HT28V8,"As the other reviews mentioned, this is a quality DVD.  I've seen other teaching dvds in the past and the production on this one is of very high quality.  It's well done and there are 3 other ""lessons"" on the disc that are good to see as well.  The match between Furyk and Funk is actually pretty short.  I definitely would've wanted to see them go a full ""18"".",1181001600,6,361,4.188405797101449
2640298,5,B000HT28V8,"If anyone wants to improve their short game dramatically, get this dvd.  You have two premier players in the world teaching you how to execute various short game shots, as they would play it, in a heads up format against each other.  Chipping, pitch shots, bunker play, even that awkward 30-50 yard wedge shot is in there.  They'll show you how to do it.

My score was in the the high 100's before the dvd, and now I average low 90's and high 80's as my average score.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely, My golf buddies thought I practice like a mad man to lower my score, when in fact, all I did was play it like the pros do.",1168300800,20,622,4.141666666666667
2640299,5,B000HT28V8,"I was really suprised by this DVD.  Most of the instructional golf DVDs I've watched end up being quite boring after a while.  Short Game Golf was extremely entertaining and very educational.  Great out-takes.  An overall must-have.

It was fun to watch Jim and Fred compete against each other while listening to their strategies.  I found it interesting that they often chose different shots for the same hole.  The production quality is top-notch and they used some fantastic graphics to illustrate strategy on each hole.

Fred Funk's bonus lessons are great for the range.  This DVD has inspired me to spend less time with my driver and more with my wedges.",1160870400,10,660,4.873873873873874

8140987,4,B000HT28V8,"Mom loves golf. So I got her DVD.

Amazing how she remembers the tips from the video! Not sure if her game improved

but she claims that her short games became better.",1493683200,,167,4.1875

8140991,3,B000HT28V8,"I guess it's an OK instructional video.  You get to follow Jim and Fred around the course to see how they play the different shots.  The video and graphics are outstanding.  However, I didn't get much value from it overall.  There isn't much that you haven't seen or heard either in a magazine or on TV.  So, I would say that it could be good for beginners, but not for advance players.",1413244800,,386,4.305555555555555

8140994,5,B000HT28V8,"This video shows a short game competition between Furyk and Funk.  They are in about 10 different short shot situations.  Each talks out loud his shot ideas, club selection, swing keys.  Each guy uses a different approach,  so you get 2 ways or shot types in each situation.  Each hits his shot, then reviews what went wrong or right.  Similar to the show ""Playing with the Pros"".  Just pop this in the DVD player and you get a quick review of all the short game shot ideas.  Very instructional!",1402272000,2,495,4.48314606741573
8140995,4,B000HT28V8,"This is worth having and using periodically for review.  For the first time golfer it won't replace some hands on learning experience but for the average golfer, or better golfer, it will likely be very helpful.",1396483200,2,211,4.861111111111111
