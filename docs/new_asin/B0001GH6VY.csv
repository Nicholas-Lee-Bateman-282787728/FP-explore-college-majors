I have been a yoga teacher for many years and enjoy exploring yoga from different viewpoints. I found the practice fairly easy to do and a very deep practice because of the constant awareness brought to the breath. There are no TriYoga classes in my area, so I was grateful to be able to practice it with a DVD. The awareness on the deep breathing created an awareness to that quiet place within and the rememberence of that would come up in the middle of the day.",1385424000,2,560,4.242990654205608
8012367,3,B0001GH6VY,I've practiced TRi Yoga for 4 years and love it. I didn't like the amount of time spent on the spinal wave. I felt she was filling in time. Overall thought I liked it and will continue to use the DVD regularly.,1353456000,,210,4.023809523809524
8012368,5,B0001GH6VY,"Love these DVDs. Big fan of KaliRay yoga. Sometimes her style is a little slow for my taste, but she's thorough and pleasure to work out with. She speaks clearly. They demonstrate variations and give clear instruction for how to modify. These DVDs and her yoga style have definitely helped me to improve my health and flexibility.",1328486400,2,330,4.807017543859649
8012369,2,B0001GH6VY,"After reading the previous reviews, I was hoping to finally get a DVD that would offer a true Yoga that focused on breathing and poses....yes they  are here .....HOWEVER - THESE POSES GO ON FOREVER.  IF anyone has any suggestions on any other Yoga videos on Amazon that will provide this without me staying in one position forever,  please post!  thanks!",1263513600,,354,4.754098360655738
8012370,5,B0001GH6VY,"I love Kali Ray!  This is only my second DVD with her as the instructor.  This DVD emphasized moves that bend, twist and stretch the spine.  You will also get some ab, arms and leg work with it.
The quality of the production is great. You do not have to turn your head awkardly to watch the screen as all of the moves are slow, repetitive and well instructed.  If you  miss it the first time, it does come around again.
I know that some reviewers complain that this is slow, but I think that is the point.  It is very meditative and stress free.  You will feel better after doing this 60  minute work out as opposed to more stressed.
This DVD does require some upper body (cat bow, sort of a modified push up) and lower body (half locust, leg lifts that work the gluteal area) strength, but Kali offers modifications and suggestions if the pose or flow is too difficult for you.
I own over 80 yoga DVD's and this series is fast becoming my second favorite (Ana Brett and Ravi Singh being my first).",1205280000,15,998,4.2712765957446805
8012371,5,B0001GH6VY,"I needed something to help me build sufficient strength to do chaturanga (low push-up) for ashtanga yoga.  This DVD was invaluable.  After doing it once a week (and practicing the spinal wave off an on in between formal practice) for about 2 months, I am now able to EASILY move from plank to chaturanga!  Not only can I easily lower into chaturanga, I can also hold this asana for one complete breath before going into a full cobra!  Please note...I am a 60 year old woman with moderately severe pulmonary fibrosis!",1179100800,11,516,4.637362637362638
