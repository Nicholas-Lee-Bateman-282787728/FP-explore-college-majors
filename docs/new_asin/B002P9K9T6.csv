3964134,5,B002P9K9T6,"I love the Waldbuhne concerts, held annually in a Berlin amphitheater modeled on the Greek one at Epidaurus, but last year's version featuring the Russians was the most spectacular yet. Under the somewhat puckish Liverpudlian (aka Scouser) Simon Rattle's direction, the concert began under the sun with excerpts from The Nutcracker. Then the Russian bear Yefim Bronfman appeared onstage to play the thunderous Rach 3, the piano concerto that all others aspire to be. Ominous black clouds appeared overhead as the sun sank in the west. A baby's cries heralded the coming storm and Bronfman paused for a minute, then began pounding the keys even harder.
Then under light rain the Berlin Philharmonic began to play Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, a ballet based on pagan rhythms which caused a riot at its premiere in Paris. Soon the sky opened up and everyone got wet. They loved it. After all, what fun is Berlin in June without a rainstorm?
As is the custom, the concert ended with the orchestra playing Berliner Luft, with all the wet attendees singing along and enjoying themselves immensely.",1262822400,7,1091,5.0
3964135,5,B002P9K9T6,"I had the great pleasure to be at this concert on father's day June 21, 2009 with my daughter. The sun was out for the first half but rain began during the intermission. Sir Simon and the  Berlin Philharmonic began the concert with the opening of the Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky followed by the Rachmaninoff third piano concerto with Yefim Bronfman. During the intermission the rain began but the concert continued with the Stravinsky Rite of Spring with the rain on and off. The encore was the Pas de Deux from the Nutcracker with Sir Simon's comment about Singing in the Rain. The rain continued as the concert ended with the ever popular Berliner Luft. I sang along with the 20,000 plus listeners as we all Sang in the Rain. The concert was available for a short time on the Medici web site and it was broadcast live on the German RBB network of which I was lucky enough to get a copy. The broadcast included interviews with both Bronfman and Sir Simon. The only other Waldbuhne concert I know of with the rain was the Abbado concert of 1996, another classic. What we heard was, of course, coming from the loudspeakers which included twelvw sub-woofers so the sound we heard was similar to what is on the DVD. I own most of the Waldbuhne DVDs and this one will be one I will never forget.",1261958400,15,1289,4.485106382978723

Up to 22,000 people can luxuriate, enjoy the view of the stage and appreciate the acoustics while Sir Simon Rattle conducts both the orchestra and Yefim Bronfman at the piano, in June 2009.
With Rachmaninov, Stravinsky, and Tchaikovsky, really, what more can you ask?",1425600000,,508,5.6103896103896105

8376775,5,B002P9K9T6,"This is not really a concert. It can be best described as a ""Musical Happening"" --------- one of these events categorized as ""Performance Art""  ------------ an Orwellian terminology for public vulgarity that is neither a performance, nor art. But I am getting ahead of myself. It is the BPO. It is Sir Simon who Rattles. It is Yefim Bronfman who owns the largest fists on the planet, bigger even than those of ex-World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Primo Carnera. It is also The Rite of Spring, and Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto that could be aptly titled Hurricane for Piano and Orchestra, but in fact was played in suburban open-air Berlin as Concerto for Piano, Orchestra, and Hurricane where the Berliners clearly demonstrated that when rain comes to wind, they can muster many more umbrellas than Jacques Demy's citizens of Cherbourg.
It was a crazy night, and it is captured superbly for all time with wonderful sound and stunning cinematography.  The stage stands in a sea of humanity that rises in front of it and travels backwards to a horizon that changes colour as light, darkness, and the elements all have their chance to wield their paint brushes on its broad canvass. It is a world apart, the world of action where everything happens, where each individual owns his personal destiny, where notes get played and might get fluffed, but miraculously never do. The world around it is the world of  passive victimhood, whose inhabitants can receive but can never give, except  applause, token of their appreciation. The concert began with a couple of Nuts from Tchaikovsky's Cracker, crunchy but pretty modest fare from an ensemble of this potential. The boxing match that followed was dramatic  ---- action-packed, full of tension, at times one-sided. In the first two rounds, Rattle clearly had Bronfman on the ropes where only the bell saved him from an ignominious KO. But in the last round he got his second wind, came out of his corner with both fists flailing, and almost put Rattle's silver scalp on the deck for good and all. But the latter ducked and weaved his way to the end of time-up when the spectators were provided with a complimentary cold shower by the management. It was a memorable contest, with honours  all round. I recall a statement in the movie SHINE that declares Rachmaninov's 3rd to be the most difficult work for the piano ever written, and it provided a contest of World Champonship quality.
I don't know whether to call the second half of this HAPPENING ""The Rite of Spring"" or ""The Brollys of Berlin"". There was plenty of both, the first in sound, the second in sight. Let me just say that for all the distractions and diversions, Rattle and his brigade were able to keep their cool and concentration, going on to deliver a memorable performance encapsulating every nuance of this difficult work in all its colour and clarity. It was as extrovert and as unashamedly exhibitionistic as you can get in the realm of music, magnified many-fold because of the setting and the impression of infinite space that it provided. The orchestra played like possessed. I have never seen Sir Simon rattle his baton to such supremely musical effect. All were wreathed in smiles in the protective cocoon of the auditorium as they gazed out at the plebians who no longer had any dry grass to sit on. They were enjoying themselves enormously, not just because of their own good fortune, but because they were clearly infatuated with what they were playing. A stellar performance, brilliantly captures for posterity, with imaginative filming and unsurpassed sound quality. At the end, the sodden audience screamed for more and they got more: two encores in the 2nd of which they joined in and turned the event into a Berliner ""Last Night at the Proms"" or a Wiener ""New Years' Eve Concert"" under the stars. Utterly memorable. I repeat, not a Concert. A Happening.",1374105600,3,3887,4.86404833836858
8376776,4,B002P9K9T6,"The Nutcracker excerpt was excellently played, and the Rites of Spring interpretation and playing were exceptional.  Although the Rites of Spring has been played to death, conductor Rattle managed to give it a fresh and vibrant interpretation.  The Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto no. 3 was also well performed.  However, the piano part was overall played at too fast a tempo and with too much egotism and even release of pent-up anger by the pianist.  But in general the piano playing was appropriately nuanced and decently controlled.  The audio mastering for the blu-ray DVD was excellent, as was the video quality.",1329436800,2,614,5.161616161616162
8376777,4,B002P9K9T6,"This is the most exciting Rach 3 on dvd that I have seen/heard. Bonfman is truly amazing in this. However, the sound is not so great, as one might expect from a huge outdoor venue. In fact, I get no sound at all from my center channel with dts or dolby surround (not a problem with other discs).However there's no problem hearing a baby crying with gusto towards the end of the first movement. I would love to hear this combination in a real concert hall absent reluctant infant concertgoers. Even with the shortcomings, this is worth having just to watch and hear Bronfman.

The Rite of Spring was disappointing, probably due to the acoustics. It was just flat-sounding, not much instrumental separation or oomph. For a hair-raising Rite, get Tilson-Thomas in his Keeping Score series - outstanding performance, sound and camera work. This was really well produced - perfect sync zeroing in on players at the exact time they're playing their part.

About the above comments on extraneous noises - There is a Rattle/BPO with Barenboim playing Brahms' first  piano concerto,where you can hear birds singing along throughout. Pity they can't edit these things out.

BUT - once again, get this for Bronfman!",1281312000,6,1204,4.887254901960785
8376778,3,B002P9K9T6,"I am sorry to bring the rating of this product down.  However, I think people who are considering buying this DVD should know what I experience. The performances are indeed wonderful, especially Bronfman's playing is larger than life.  The sound and picture quality are great EXCEPT the sound and picture are not in sync most of the time, probably a result of integrating many camera angles.  One would think the technologies nowadays would have no problem resolving the issue but it is not the case here.  And this drove me nut, I had to close my eyes to enjoy the concert. If you want to see how bad it is, maybe clips on YouTube would give you some ideas.  The picture is usually behind the sound in most views.  The conductor's view seems to be the only one that is in sync with the sound.",1278633600,20,793,4.43448275862069
8376779,5,B002P9K9T6,"Simon Rattle, conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in the huge ampitheater, Waldbuhne, outside of Berlin, gives the viewer a healthy dose of great Russian classics. The program opens with Igor Stravinsky's pagan Rite of Spring, with its frightening music of human sacrifice. This is followed by Sergei Rachmaninoff's Third Piano concerto, played for all it's worth  by Yefim Bronfman. Closing the program are charming excerpts from Peter Tchaikovsky's, The Nutcracker. It's a grand program, beautifully played by the Berliners, with good sound and visuals. It should be in every music lover's library.",1271894400,3,599,5.582417582417582
