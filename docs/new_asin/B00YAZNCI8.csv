7209421,1,B00YAZNCI8,"This movie is pure torture. Annoying and not disturbing at all. Disturbingly boring and unoriginal. Found footage kidnap fake snuff movie that made me wish I was duck taped in a trunk so I didn't have to watch this.

The whole movie is pretty much a boring cat and mouse game that drags on at a snails pace. From the trunk to a warehouse to a basement in said warehouse and finally into my trash. Nothing to see here move along people. If the director had a gun to my head and made me say something positive about the film I would say I guess the score was ok.",1445212800,8,560,4.137614678899083
7209432,1,B00YAZNCI8,"I'm not sure which was more shaky - the camera, the story or the acting. Let's call it three-way tie, give it the 1-star it so deserves, and move on to something with more than just a promise to deliver in the marketing literature,teasers and planted reviews.

I'm not giving it a poor review because I'm offended at the content. I AM, however, offended by the shameful bait-and-switch, complete with laughable awards, planted 5-star reviews, and the entire buildup in the synopsis which leads you to believe this is some original and highly controversial movie that is just now being released ""from the underground.""Nothing could be further from the truth.

The truth, unfortunately, is that this is another low-budget project with all the trappings that result in an awful movie...actually worse than most.",1471132800,,808,5.067669172932331

7209440,2,B00YAZNCI8,Shame on Amazon to allow such a movie. I understand these or like things happen in every country. Maybe a good show to bring folks to reality of the true adnormal. Not good for those with twisted minds--.Movies as this should not be allowed anywhere.,1462147200,,250,4.5777777777777775

7209453,1,B00YAZNCI8,"This film is a horror. I mean it is truly a horror. Admittedly I brought this on myself, as I did read all of the comments, for the most part nobody liked this movie at all. Then I looked at the five star reviews and saw the comments from one of the films producers/actors, and someone with a cheesy plastic award that this film earned - I couldn't pass on this film after those two reviews, I needed to see what type of product came out of minds that have been praised and assured of greatness since birth. The film was pretty much what you would expect from people who get a trophy just for showing up.
The story starts out poorly, then it gets worse. There is not much of a plot to follow, apparently some guys wife is kidnapped, the prostitute he is having an affair with goes with him in search of her. Somehow, he ends up with a video camera from the kidnappers, and the plot becomes a gorefest. Not much suspense, lots of running around, and for the viewer, wondering why the heck the actors are running around so much.
Fortunately the production crew of this film has enough money that they could create this horror and it doesn't look as it was filmed on a cellphone. The first few minutes of the film are not to be viewed by those that are prone to motion sickness. This is another film that has potential to be a pretty good drinking game. Each time you see blood or hear the piercing scream of the main actress, take a drink. You should be drunk enough in the first thirty minutes to pass out for the remainder of the film.",1456012800,5,1535,4.260273972602739
7209454,2,B00YAZNCI8,Not nearly as good or gritty they made it seem. Actually pretty lame. Pretty disappointed.,1454716800,,90,5.066666666666666

7209456,5,B00YAZNCI8,"This movie won the DOA Blood Bath Film Festival in Dallas. It's a bit of a slow burn to open, but then things heat up, and the ending is shocking. Katie Keene is excellent in the central performance and I would agree that the score by Paul Wiley is also excellent. The movie also has a very interesting backstory -- it was cut from ""reality"" footage shot by underground Detroit filmmaker Jorje Krippe, a very controversial character.",1449014400,,433,4.636363636363637

7209458,1,B00YAZNCI8,Eerie. Lack of plot. Too much talking. Most of them is senseless. I turned it off after 15 minutes.,1448236800,2,99,4.2631578947368425
7209459,1,B00YAZNCI8,Wow.  That was a movie?  I guess I could run through a vacant building filming with my cell phone and produce something similar....,1448064000,3,131,4.6521739130434785

8717939,3,B00YAZNCI8,"Some spoilers herein... Hard to see, and hard to read about, this film has some merit though, as another entry in the shock-handheld cam genre. It's basically one man & a prostitute (the latter a believable/sympathetic portrayal) trying to escape a vast industrial complex and some snuff filmmakers who are trying entrap & kill & film them. I don't agree with the other review posted here; I think sometimes what violence the camera doesn't show has compelling value (remember Resevoir Dogs?) Besides, later on in the film, we do see a montage of the snuff filmmakers' work, so there's a nice blast of visceral imagery toward the end. A decent effort, I would definitely watch more from this writer/filmmaker.",1475107200,3,709,4.966386554621849
8717940,1,B00YAZNCI8,"What this movie did right, the music, it was a very good soundtrack choice. The girl was quite good at her role as well. You got the feeling she was in deep and truly terrified.

What this movie did wrong, the camera. Having it be the supposed tense first person perspective took away from the movie. It allowed them to cut more than a few corners and played to the lack of budget; but ended up hurting the movie way too much. If you want a cheap thrill I'd say look elsewhere.",1474588800,,477,4.184782608695652
8717941,1,B00YAZNCI8,"This film is barely watchable. I have watched some pretty intense horror films (Serbian Film, Human Centipede 1~3, Guinea Pigs, Salo, etc.) and this film is just an experimental found footage film trying to be a snuff film.",1473206400,,223,4.894736842105263
