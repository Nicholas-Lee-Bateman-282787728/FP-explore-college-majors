8230302,4,B000XYBDVS,The tapes are on the boring side.  I expected more coverage of the actual financial policies.  It's interesting the amount of BS that was put out during this time period.  It's no wonder the kids in the 1960s were pissed off.  I do think that the service given by the seller was very good.,1278892800,4,289,4.296296296296297
