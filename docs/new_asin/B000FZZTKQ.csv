8128045,5,B000FZZTKQ,"I first viewed this movie about 10 or 12 years ago, and I truly fell in love with it, and shortly thereafter contacted its maker, Steve Kroschel.

Wolverines, which this movie is about, have a ferocious reputation in all of the far North latitudes, where they live still.  American indians have told stories for many centuries about their cunning, intelligence and fierceness, and trappers hated and feared them.

This story is about a young boy who becomes friends with an orphaned ""kit"" -as baby wolverines are called- during a summer in the Alaskan wilderness.  The beauty of the scenery and the touching affection between the two of them is very heart-warming and shows not only the potential fierceness that a wolverine is capable of when facing grizzly bears and wolves, but also the deep affection they are capable of with humans who treat them well and the constant playfulness that is naturally part of their nature, as it is with their cousins, the otters.

Some skeptical viewers may say that this is only a movie, and that wolverines are not affectionate with humans, but it may be worth noting that the producer of the movie, Steve Kroschel, has raised a number of wolverines from infants and has also obtained others as adults, and has an extraordinarily affectionate relationship with them, some of which starred in his movie.

This movie is educational, visually stunning, and instructive about nature, Alaska and Alaskans, and the true nature of wolverines, which are part of the weasel family, as are martins, weasels, otters, ferrets? Fishers, and others.  I absolutely recommend this movie for family viewing.  It delights adults and children, as well as teenagers and grandparents.  Exceptionally good film.
