There are better demonic vehicle movies out The Car, Christine,even if your looking for killer truck driver Joy Ride is good one. This I would not reccomend to anyone even to kill boredom.

4190004,2,B003T04NDS,"I really find it hard to write something about this film.  I'm kind of shocked that this thing even got made.  It's not very good.  I don't want to say too much about the actors because I think the cast gave it a sincere effort and probably did pretty good with the material they had to work with, but the plot was so silly.  For instance, when Nina opened the back door of the trailer and walked inside...My thought was ""Really?"" Who in their right mind, or even out of their right mind would have gone in there?  And then at 120 minutes, when she hesitated to pull the trigger.  Oh, heck no.  Usually, I give stars for meeting the expectations I had for a movie going into it.  If it meets expectations, then I rate it higher no matter how low those expectations were.  Well, I didn't have real high expectaions for this one, but ROAD KILL does not even meet the minimum either in horror or parody. It is no fun at any point and does seem to take itself seriously.  I can't even put it in a class with other films that are so bad they're good. I gave it 2 stars because I made it through to the end and because the ending was kind of interesting.  I actually had to replay the ending then go back and look at an earlier scene to determine what exactly had happened.  Unfortunately, going back did not explain it so I just had to go with my own thoery.",1282435200,5,1353,4.161538461538462

These are not detailed reviews. Just my quick thoughts.

Hunger (4.5) Intense with good acting.
Dark House (4.5) Silly but a really fun ride.
Grimm Love (3.5) Well made but off putting story.
Fragile (3.5) Well acted but a tad slow.

4190006,5,B003T04NDS,"While it may never be possible to convert the chopped-up corpses of Earth Liberation Front activists directly into gasoline to power your car, it's a delicious irony that ""Road Kill"" explores with juicy fervor. Or, I wish it had. Ultimately, what we end up with is ""Christine"" meets ""Maximum Overdrive,"" by way of ""Hostel."" The latter is apparently necessary these days to get the ham-headed horror-jock flock to leave the basement long enough to ask mommy if they can order it off Netflix.

Actually, I'm giving this 5 stars solely for the reason that Stephen King is probably very upset about this film. And because of the scene where the ""Dawson's Creek""-looking guy finishes his last bottle of water, immediately pees into the bottle and attempts to drink it piping hot.",1281225600,3,774,4.908396946564886
4190007,2,B003T04NDS,"Let me first say I am usually a big fan of the Australian Horror Films. This film starts off ok and then goes straight down hill. Road Kill takes place when a Truck rams into a car filled with four people and causes them to crash. They then go after the driver and Truck which has stopped not far from the crash only to find no driver inside. **SPOILERS** The Truck requires blood to run, playes hypnotic music causing them to leave the Highway and drive off road, has some Wolf Heads' Symbol they never explain, causes visions... Very disappointing and very lame. Waste of time and quite frankly this has been done several times before such as The Mangler. This series overall was to be as the 8 films to die for but comes up short. Way short. Pighunt was at least entertaining enough to watch if you want something a little different. **Check out ""Grimm Love"" and ""Fragile"" probably the best two films out of this series.",1281225600,5,923,4.4674556213017755

4190009,4,B003T04NDS,"I am not a horror fan, but somehow this film grabbed my attention.  It is scary, but different because you are possessed by a dingo decorated trailer truck or 'road train' as they call them down under.

The acting was real good for a low budget film, and the outback looked both dangerous and beautiful.  There is a sex scene between Sophie Lowe (ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland) and Bob Morley (CW's The 100) in the beginning, but no nudity, no 'parts' are shown.  Then, you got the graphic injury of Morley's arm through out the film.  He does a great job of going insane, and both of the actors are hitting thirty when they play 18 year olds.  They both do a great job of being eighteen though, despite physically,they do not look it.  The girls were okay, nothing stood out about them except Sophie's gladiater sandals.

Injured, they go into the driver-less cab and take off down the road and then... Okay I don't know what happens. Was the truck demonically possessed? Then they got possessed? What was with the three headed dog we never saw? Is this a Greek mythology thing?

And is this one of the things we should know about the outback?

They film had some blood and body parts. I thought the lack of a decent explanation or any explanation detracted from a film that needed something more. Too much time spent of four people whose character left me bored. Fangoria has had better.

4190013,4,B003T04NDS,"Road Train (Dean Francis, 2010)

Man, Road Train, released in America as Road Kill, is getting savaged on the Internet. It has a 3.8 rating on IMDb as I write this (Rotten Tomatoes doesn't have enough reactions, either critically or from the public, to form an opinion yet), and the reviews and comment board are full of bile. [Note: between the writing of this review and the publishing of it, I have discovered the Syfy Channel repackaged this as a Syfy Original Movie; suddenly a lot of the above makes a lot more sense.] Now, I grant you, I am coming into this movie as an existing fan of both Sophie Lowe (The Clinic) and Xavier Samuel (The Loved Ones), so I was kind of partial to the movie before I even hit play (and noting on IMDB that Samuel was also in Eclipse clarifies a lot of things about the movie's chilly reception), and you know what? Now that I've finished it, I still don't see the problem. It's certainly not the most original movie in the world, though most of these demon-car flicks put one traveler up against the Satanic vehicle (The Appointment, Duel, and the third segment of Nightmares all come to mind) while this one puts a quartet of friends up against the possessed Road Train (in America, you probably know the Road Train as a triple-decker or stacked semi--it's where one cab is hauling two or three semi trailers) in question, and once you realized what other flick it's crossed the Duel conventions with, it becomes predictable enough. But solid acting, excellent cinematography, and a better-than-average script powered this one right on through the night.

Plot: four friends--Marcus (Samuel), Nina (Lowe), Craig (Home and Away's Bob Morley), and Liz (Crawl's Georgina Haig)--are on a camping trip in the Outback when they get into an accident. Well, kind of an accident. The titular monster truck trashes their car and leaves them stranded, mostly uninjured (Craig has a broken arm) but shaken. They set out to find the nearest civilization, but come upon the truck, seemingly abandoned. ""Seemingly."" Lacking other transportation, and with the truck's driver sniping at them from the desert, the four friends decide to take the nearest available transport--but soon discover the truck is not what it seems to be...

...and what it is is pretty obvious if you're seen the movie poster. Or, for that matter, read the first paragraph of this review. The movie distinguishes itself by going deeper into that malevolent, disembodied intelligence than most movies of this strip do; all you know about the trucks in the movies mentioned at the top of this review is that their drivers, or devils, are out to kill the protagonists. Here, we have a group rather than an individual, letting said intelligence work in a more insidious fashion, playing mental and emotional games with the protagonists instead of just going on a balls-out attack all the time. You may have seen it all before, but not necessarily put together in this way; absolutely worth a watch. Don't let the Internet put you off it. *** ",1375228800,3,3036,4.810344827586207
4190014,4,B003T04NDS,"Released in 2011, ""Roadkill"" is yet another creature-on-the-loose flick from Syfy. This time it's a giant bird-of-prey, the mythical Roc, preying upon a bunch of youths touring rural Ireland in an RV, picking 'em off one by one.

With Syfy you never know what you're going to get. For every ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Mountain/dp/B000JYW5UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Mountain</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Within/dp/B0026HXH50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Within</a>"" there's a ""Mega Cleavage Vs. Gatorade."" With a title like ""Roadkill"" the prognosis wasn't very good, but ""Roadkill"" surprised me.

The movie combines elements of several films: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers-2/dp/B002Q32OQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers 2</a>"" (flying creature attacking a bus full of youths) and countless other flying creature flicks like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carny/dp/B003CJMPG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carny</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wyvern-Maneater-Series/dp/B00284G2A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wyvern: Maneater Series</a>"", as well as films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B001HM22VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dying-Breed/dp/B0026HZ2GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dying Breed</a>"" (malevolent hicks in remote areas). It also has a subplot about an old gypsy curse, which is reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drag-Me-to-Hell-Unrated/dp/B002MX0T6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drag Me to Hell (Unrated)</a>"". If you like these types of films ""Roadkill"" is as good or better.

What makes it ""as good or better""? For one, it's filmed on location in mysterious rural areas of Ireland, which sets it apart from most Syfy flicks which are filmed in British Columbia, Romania or Bulgaria. Secondly, it has a likable cast with a good assortment of gorgeous women. Thirdly, the CGI creature is well done, unlike say the cartooney cat in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabretooth/dp/B000KHI0AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabretooth</a>."" Fourthly, the material is taken seriously and never devolves into camp or goofiness. Fifthly, this is just a solidly made Grade-B creature feature. The filmmakers obviously took the time to make a quality product and this is seen in numerous scenes. For instance, the sparrow scene (you'll know what I mean when you see it), as well as the touching reflective sequences in-between bird attacks and the many atmospheric forest/moors images. I also like how the film touches on the human breaking point and insanity, which would certainly be a possibility (or probability) if this occurred in real life.

The initial review of ""Roadkill"" on IMDb gives the film the absolute lowest rating possible (1/10), which is absurd, not to mention inexplicably gives away the ending (?!). What a moron.

This reviewer refers to the youths as ""stereotypical beautiful college kids"" but, as far as the dudes go, I don't see any Brad Pitts, and as far as the ladies go, they're pretty hot, as noted above, but not unbelievably so. Also, despite the token minority they seem like a realistic circle of friends.

This reviewer also rags on the film for the huge RV, but this is a pretty big group of youths so the RV HAS to be big enough to accommodate them. Besides, we see huge RVs all over rural areas of North America, why would it be any different in Ireland?

BOTTOM LINE: ""Roadkill"" is a solid low-budget flying creature flick with a sideplot of ee-vil gypsies and is well worth your time if you're into these types of films. It's at least as good as ""Wyvern"" and I like it better than ""Jeepers Creepers 2.""

The film runs 88 minutes.

4190015,3,B003T04NDS,"Ever since landing a role in the Twilight movies, Australian soap hunk, Xavier Samuel has been every where! Recently, many films he made back in Australia have been turning up on DVD in the U.S. and Road Kill is one of those films. Picked up as part of the Fangoria Frightfest, Road Kill isn't your typical horror flick. It has it's fair share of gore and beautiful people, but the story is defiantly unique. Four backpackers in the outback get run off the road by a large truck. Unable to go anywhere, they start walking and find the truck abandoned up the road. Since they're stuck in the middle of nowhere, they decide to take it and that's when they start to change. It's not the most original story, but it's not predictable either. Xavier Samuel does a terrific job as the groups leader, trying to make sense of the whole things. Both female leads, Sophie Lowe and Georgina Haig, are also really good. I tend to find in films like this that the girls are super hot, but very rarely can they act, but that's not the case here. Road Kill impressed me, but it's not all good, as parts of it were extremely slow and some of the dialogue was kind of ridiculous. Road Kill's a pretty entertaining film, it's nothing special, but it's not bad either.",1361491200,,1249,4.458515283842795

Young people in horror movies have been around forever, there have also been some crazy trucker movies. So what would happen when the two come together, well this movie is that answer. Now I know you are saying this type of movie has been done before, well not like this really. I want to tell you what the deal is here but that would give so much away.

""Road Kill"" or ""Road Train"" as it was originally called follows a group of friends on the road, of course. All is well until a road train runs them off of the road; a road train is a truck hauling two large trailers. When they all regroup after their crash they notice the truck has stopped up the road. Of course youngn's always think they are indestructible so they head up to it. What for you may ask, well to give the driver what for of course. Once there they realize the driver is gone, but only for a brief moment as the driver comes back shooting. They dive into the truck and take off getting away from the truck driver, but all is not what it seems. They one by one start to fall asleep including the driver, but they wake up fine in the middle of nowhere. How did they get there and what could be going on inside this road train?

I have to say that I liked the story behind this film since it turns out to be more than what you would expect. In fact the villain here is not who you first believe it to be, in the end it turns out kinda cool. But the thing that bothers me about this flick is that the acting is not up to par with some of the actors. Also the story can be a little out there but for a guy that watches SyFy channel movies all the time I thought it was good.

The best way I can describe this flick is by saying it is a cross between ""Maximum Overdrive"" and ""Christine"". I know what you are going to say, both of those are about vehicles that come to life. Well not really when you think about it and if you watch this flick you will most likely catch on to what I am saying. My brother pointed it out to me so I am sure you will get it. Any way this flick is about friends that are just young, dumb, and you know the rest. Plus a truck [SPOILER] that runs on blood, so the flick is ok minus some acting. The DVD has a commentary track and the trailers for the other Fangoria Fright Fest films.",1351641600,2,2287,4.008771929824562
4190020,3,B003T04NDS,"I'm in a difficult position. I like this movie but wouldn't recommend it, not even to those diehard horror fans like me that must watch all horror movies. It's not one of those ""it's so bad it's good"" type of movies. It's one of those ""It's so bad, it's bad. Nevertheless, I like it but I wouldn't recommend it because I know most people wouldn't care for it"" type of movies. I wonder if other people have ever been in my position.

I liked the cinematography. It had nice photography and scenery. I didn't like or dislike the characters. But I was interested in their fate. I was also interested in their conflicts with one another. I liked the music as well. Sometimes it grated on my nerves. But most of the time it went well with the movie and satisfied my musical tastes. Personally, I liked the whole atmosphere of the movie and have watched it several times since buying it two days ago.

I wanted to give this a 2.5 rating. My star rating is a 3star system: 1 star=poor; 2stars=far/pretty good; 3stars=good/excellent. I'd give this 2stars. It's possible I could watch it more and my rating will increase :) But I can be a weird guy sometimes.

I couldn't recommend it because there were too many plotholes. Admittedly, I believe I understand the movie better than others, but I still saw a crapload of plotholes. The cover is also misleading. The girl crawling away from the semi gives the impression that this is a killer truck driver movie ala Joy Ride. The killer truck driver doesn't exist at all. The protagonists are the killers of each other. The truck drives them insane enough to kill each other.

All in all, this is a movie where you will see LOTS of unexplained things happening. It's not a movie that will make you think. But it's the type of movie where you have to draw your own conclusions. Sometimes it works in cinema, sometimes it doesn't. Judging by the fact that the majority of reviews for this movie are negative, I'd say this didn't work for most people. For those of you who still want to see this movie, here's what I'd recommend: read the synopsis for this movie on wikipedia or imdb; read the reviews; read the spoilers; watch clips or even the full movie; etc. I would not recommend you buy this movie for more than half minimum wage. I got mine for 99 cents. Maybe that's why I can be so forgiving.",1334188800,,2336,4.476525821596244
4190021,2,B003T04NDS,"Here's another typical Australian low-budget horror flick shot out in the middle of no-where in Australia because you pay pretty much nothing for the filming location, only to give international audiences the feeling that Australia has nothing buy open ranges of nothing and you will die if you go out there alone. In this hard to beleive story, a group of friends are off Jeeping in the middle of nowhere when a road-train appears from behind them and bumps them. So the genius behind the wheel decides his FWD is faster and will overtake the truck, get in front... and Do what? So the 4 morons in the FWD end up knocked off the road and their car is totaled. Amazingly they survive, and the truck is parked just up the road from them. When they investigate the truck, there is no driver, until the driver returns screaming like a lunatic, the 4 steal the truck and escape. Only this truck I guess is from hell? Now weird things begin to happen to them and they begin losing the plot out in the middle of nowhere.

The acting in this is pretty bad, and the whole plot of their actions is unanswered, yet, not scary, so in no way did I even care why these things are happening and they are acting the way they are. When you find out what fuels the truck, I just rolled my eyes and thought that was a dumb idea. The ending of the movie is pretty predictable, I knew from the time they investigated the truck how this was going to end.

I won't say it's a god awful movie, it was worthy of watching once. So rent it if it interests you, but I highly doubt you will ever want to own it and see it ever again. There is no gore for you gore fans, which you would probably expect from Fangoria. But that is not the reason I rated the movie so low, even if it had gore, the movie would be no better. The acting and characters are just down right annoying at most times, and there ability to drift in and out of possessed characters is atrocious. Or are they not possessed? Maybe they are just losing their actual minds and acting that way when they signed on to do this movie that had not been thought out very well... or the director attempted to go all artsy-fartsy and try to make the twist intriguing with no inspiration on how to achieve it.",1326412800,,2239,4.265882352941176

And, no, the characters do not act in an inexplicably stupid manner -- other than doing something people who've watch Spielberg's ""Duel"" would think twice about, strange behaviour is part of the plot.

Maybe I can relate because I, myself, survived a similar type situation years ago while coming home from college. Road Kill, however, despite it's  enticing cover art,  is just flat out insipidly dull. It's about 4 idiots in the Australian outback who make stupid decisions. Everything in this movie is annoying and makes no sense (a haunted truck?? [smh]). The dialogue is terrible, the characters are less than one dimensional (if that's possible). There's even a ""Dingo took him"" joke...There's no suspense at all, and even worst, really no plot.. It also has a hard time figuring out what time of day it's supposed to be. If you want a better Australian made horror, skip this and see Wolf Creek, and if you've seen Wolf Creek, see it again.",1461196800,,926,4.78125
8404880,4,B003T04NDS,"Spoilers ahead! Okay, I only watched this movie because I'm a fan of Bob Morley from The 100. I thought it was going to be a gory slasher flick, but instead it's more psychological. I never quite understood why the truck was so addictive and why it runs on human bodies, but I was interested in watching the characters go crazy and turn on each other. Only one girl is unaffected by the truck for some unknown reason. I watched the movie to the end only because I was genuinely curious who would survive. I was really hoping the character of Craig could be saved, and that he and Nina could get out of there, but alas no such luck. All in all, it's not bad, just a little weird and slow at times. The acting was mostly good, and the scenery was amazing. I might watch it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything.",1449446400,,818,4.2165605095541405

8404882,4,B003T04NDS,"I'll be honest: I bought this movie simply because I'm a fan of Bob Morley. And for a Bob Morley fan, it certainly does not disappoint. On a purely superficial level, him being shirtless throughout half of the film certainly helps.

That aside, I really didn't dislike it as much as I was expecting to. I thought the 4 main actors did a really good job selling the plot (as bizarre as it was) They all brought an impressive intensity to their roles. After the first 10 minutes, I thought I knew where the plot was going, but it actually surprised me. If you go into it with an open mind, as I did, it can be enjoyed for what it is: a light & entertaining psychological thriller. That's definitely how I would describe it. If not for the copious amounts of blood, it wouldn't be classified as a horror film.",1428105600,5,806,4.337748344370861
