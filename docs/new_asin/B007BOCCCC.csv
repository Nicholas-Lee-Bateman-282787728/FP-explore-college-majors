It has most of the major Universal Trailers plus a selection of other horror movies - one of which (The Phantom of the Opera) is in color. The trailers are as is - no cleaning, enhancement, etc has been done to them. However, to me, that's part of their charm - after all some of them are more than 75 years old!

This would be nice to show outside at Halloween on a big screen (I plan on doing that for Halloween if the weather is ok) or maybe for a Halloween party!

So, to summarize, this is a nice collection of old horror trailers. This would be nice for Halloween fanatics, old movie lovers or Universal horror freaks. I would rate this a very good 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10!",1494979200,,765,4.155405405405405

Surprisingly there are some Spaghetti westerns, musicals, and dramas mixed in with the horror and sci-fi trailers.  Other than that at almost two hours this is not a bad buy.  The DVD-R is in very good condition.  Recommended for trailer fans.",1442620800,,310,5.019607843137255
