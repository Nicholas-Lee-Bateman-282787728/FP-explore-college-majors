7865500,5,6304164068,"My daughter loves Wishbone and it is a great way to introduce kids to classic literature.
The story brings out questions from the audience to want to know more about the actual book.",1360108800,,182,4.545454545454546

7865502,5,6304164068,"Well obviously the episodes title Bone of Arc is taken from the book Joan of Arc (Written by Mark Twain) who's writing I'm not a fan of, but this is still a great episode.

Joan wants to convince the King of France to give her an army to lead against the English invaders. Louis (played by Wishbone) doesn't get too much of a role in this episode so I don't quite think it is as good as some. While back in Oakdale Without their best player Joe and David need help to defeat their undefeated rivals in an upcoming soccer tournament and Samantha steps in. But are Samantha and the rest of the team good enough to win the tournament?

Well just because wishbone doesn't have much of a role in this episode doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. It's still a great episode!",1245196800,,768,4.326388888888889

7865504,5,6304164068,"I love all the Wishbone eposodes, but this one is by far the best.  I love the story of Joan and what she did for France, it is an amazing story and Wishbone is an amazing show!  Because of Wishbone I know what some of the classic books are about, which is nice to know.",1093392000,,270,3.890909090909091
7865505,5,6304164068,"If you check out the ""Bone of Arc"" episode of ""Wishbone"" expecting to see the world's most imaginative Jack Russell terrier dressed up as the Maid of Orleans, you are going to be disappointed.  Wishbone is Joan of Arc's friend Louis de Conte.  The other thing you will want to know going in is that this particular tale of Joan leading the French Army against the English comes from the Mark Twain version, so you do not have to worry about you kids going off to read Shaw's version of Joan's martyrdom.  Meanwhile, back in the real world, Samantha (Christie Abbott) is encouraged by Wishbone to become the heroine of the boys soccer team.  ""Bone of Arc"" is one of the best episodes in this imaginative series that I have seen so far.  Sam's story stands on its own and the parallel with the story of Joan just adds more good things.  It is a good thing that this show is about reading books because it gives you something to do while waiting for the next adventure.",1008979200,6,966,4.429378531073446
