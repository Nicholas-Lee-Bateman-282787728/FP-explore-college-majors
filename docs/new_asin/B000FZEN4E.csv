Liner notes on the 2-dvd set list each of Frank's 21 gold records and the year, along with the various record labels he recorded with and the years.  While at Columbia Records he sang duets with many of that label's stars, mainly Jo Stafford, but also with Jimmy Boyd and Johnnie Ray.

8128036,4,B000FZEN4E,"There isn't much around on Frankie Laine in DVD or even video - surprising considering the longevity of his career. This one is an absolute must for the die hard fan of this wonderful vocalist and entertainer. The documentary goes right through his career and there are plenty of interesting facts - like how he came about the name etc.
My only criticism is that there are not enough full length show case performances. The ones that are there are really enjoyable, but we can't ever get too much of this legendary performer. If you listen and have followed his career through the 50's to when he passed away - buy this one - you will be spellbound by the story. RAWHIDE!",1343347200,,671,4.508196721311475
8128037,5,B000FZEN4E,This is an excellent biography of a truly legendary vocalist and old-school crooner. The best part is that it was done while he was still alive and had many personal insights of his own as well. Well worth the price!,1207612800,2,216,4.425

It is great to see Frankie Laine himself being interviewed! I'm thrilled with this project. A must for music fans!",1149638400,17,286,5.1063829787234045
