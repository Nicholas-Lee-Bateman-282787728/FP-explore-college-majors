8545284,2,B009YMGWZC,Disappointed that singing is mainly PANTOMINED although storyline is okay.,1496966400,,74,6.5
8545285,5,B009YMGWZC,Loved it. Says it's a volume 1 but I don't think they made more. Can't find ost available to get tracks. I think lunatic is my favorite song by Daesung But maybe that's because it's unavailable. The audio during some of the songs was a little muted like volume control which is why I'm looking for the ost... and the should have special features with songs or something.,1491868800,,370,4.455882352941177
8545286,5,B009YMGWZC,"It is an amazing piece of art. I love the camera work, I love the soundtrack that goes with it. The characters are amazing with unique stories of their own. They have an amazing cast, including Big Bang's Daesung, who is incredible in this TV show. It's a must watch for anyone.",1465430400,,278,4.365384615384615
8545287,5,B009YMGWZC,"I rated the drama itself 5 stars because I saw it online and enjoyed it considerably enough to own it.  Daesung from #1 Korean Hip Hop group Big Bang, was awesome with his unbelievable vocal talent and hardrock performances in this picture.  HOWEVER!!!!,  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PRODUCED BY PMP ENTERTAINMENT!!!  I GIVE IT A SOLID -0- STAR RATING BECAUSE OF ITS POOR QUALITY AND AMATEUR EDITING!!!  I ordered the same DVD from one dealer and retuned it by reason of defect but when I reordered from another dealer, it was also defective at the same footage!  So annoying and so poorly put together, sputtering and stopping constantly!!!  But even more MADDENING is that the original music was DUBBED with some other crap that I didn't match the mouthing, and the sound quality was so horribly off that it totally ruined everything great about this drama!!!  What were they thinking when they dubbed the music from this ""MUSICAL DRAMA""!  NUTS!!!  WARNING:  DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS PUT OUT BY PMP ENTERTAINMENT.",1423785600,3,1003,4.7398843930635834
