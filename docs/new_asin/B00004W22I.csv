1359540,5,B00004W22I,"I am a long time fan of The Avengers.  While I have been primarily interested in the Emma Peel episodes, I found the Cathy Gale episodes interesting, too.  The quality of the episodes isn't as sharp as I would like, but one must consider how long ago they were made (47 years).

I am glad to add them to my collection of The Avengers DVD's.",1288656000,2,340,4.2
1359541,5,B00004W22I,"If you relish a series like ""Honey West,"" ""Peter Gunn"" or ""77 Sunset Strip"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), ""You scratch my hat and I'll scratch your, well what ever. Just watch the umbrella please."" John and Cathy Gale are back and are here to stay via DVD's digital technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. Steed they look good, very good old boy.",972000000,2,615,4.6

  The 4 episodes in the 2nd volume of this set seem to me to comprise the best of the Honor Blackman lot so far. For starters, it is good to see the very young Peter Bowles (""The Prisoner,"" ""To the Manor Born,"" etc.), Warren Mitchell (who would appear twice later as the bumbling Brodny), and even Leonard Rossiter (who would portray the immortal Reginald Perrin in his own series).
  Then we can enjoy the elements, which would later be reworked into Rigg episodes. ""Dressed to Kill"" is essentially the same basic idea as ""The Superlative Seven"" from the 1967 series in which a seemingly mixed group are lured to a party (this time aboard a train) for reasons they have to reason out themselves. ""Death A La Carte"" seems to predict ""Honey for the Prince,"" the last of the black and white Riggs, even having the little round Ken Parry (the honey man in the later episode) as the head of the kitchen. And then there is the famous ""Don't Look Behind You"" which was redone almost intact with Rigg as ""The Joker."" You remember, Cathy/Mrs. Peel is invited to a spooky old house by a spy she once seduced and turned in to Our Side.
  The other episodes are not bad, although one suffers from very bad sound. Some of the camera shots, however, of  ""Second Sight"" are almost cinematic and definitely a pioneering effort in live TV production.
  There is seldom the sparks-go-flying chemistry between Gale and Steed as there was going to be between Peel and Steed; and the horrible percussion that inevitably accompanies the fights do not make them any more exciting--but at least we know that doubles are not being used and it was shot ""live"" after all. Further, Johnny Dankworth's music is somewhat repetitious and unimaginative; the scores by Laurie Johnson for the Rigg series will be witty and appropriate.  Still, it is not fair to judge this set by what was to come. So where I gave the '64 set four stars, I should but am not permitted to give this one 4 1/2. Therefore I will let that bad sound lose a point and recommend this one as good fun.",970012800,12,2064,4.539083557951482
1359543,5,B00004W22I,"Could it get any better? I think not. Honor Blackman as the briliant Cathy Gale and Patrick Macnee as Mr Steed.
These few episodes go part way to explaining the relationship between the the main characters for the rest of episodes sharing  the ""Avengers"" name.
We get a glimpse inside the ""ministry"" which was a bit of a thrill for me.
The filming techiques changed considerably between '64 and '65. This season demonstrated what sort of advances could be made in technique  resulting in the '65 season looking totally different. In fact it was the rough and ready style of the '64  season that made me realise what truely fabulous actors this couple were. They had only their talent and great writers. No wiz-bangery here!
Having said all that, there just isn't anything better than these two swapping pithy comments whilst fighting the bad guys and still looking totally glamerous.
Keep in mind that the later episodes displayed the muchly improved cinimatography ( in other words they were better at using a camera! )
What these guys did with such a tight budget is totally amazing.  Clever scripts and brilliant chemistry made for one of the true highlights of recent re-releases.
I gave it 5 stars and why not I say?",969580800,6,1221,4.7725118483412325

7924533,5,B00004W22I,"Word to the wise when ordering The Avengers (great show of course) but you should be aware that the box sets often contain two volumes, so if you order Volume 2 you're actually going to receive only the second disc of Set 1 (Set 1 contains Volumes 1 & 2 and Set 2 contains Volumes 3 & 4). Once you get the right ordering information, you won't be disappointed.  I recommend ordering the sets because of the added cover art and convenience of the packaging.",1382918400,,456,4.364705882352941
