8294299,5,B001DN0UP8,Bought all DVDs individually and loved the whole series.  It's so funny to see ther main character being haunted by ghosts that he can only see and having the love of his life talking to his arch enemy who could care less about her.  Very wonderful series.  Can't wait for season 2 to come out.,1242777600,,294,4.3090909090909095
8294300,3,B001DN0UP8,I never could get into this series very much. I always tried but after so many plot points that got picked up and then dropped again it just became a chore to keep up with whatever story elements it tried to present. What started as a very interesting premise dissolved very quickly into lots of half ideas that eventually fizzled out. The time I spent on this series wasn't a waste but I certainly don't feel compelled to see the next OVA or TV season in the series.,1233273600,,467,4.318181818181818
8294301,5,B001DN0UP8,"Holic is amazing.  It would be redundant to repeat how much I love the show over and over, but I really do.

its spiritual, with great ""new age"" philosophies behind great writing, beautiful animation and fabulous stories.

It really just keeps getting better.  Keep watching, you won't regret it, its amazing.  :)",1231286400,2,313,4.9423076923076925
