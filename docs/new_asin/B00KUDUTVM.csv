6448832,2,B00KUDUTVM,"They really decided to stretch the dollars of kill la kill fans when they made this series. This may look awesome but 60$ for 4 episodes and an artbook is nowhere near worth what it should be. I understand that each frame is being redone and new frames are being added, but it just isn't worth the money at the moment. Buy it if you REALLY have to have it in your collection. If you are looking to own the whole series though, and don't want to spend $450 on 25 episodes of anime, then i suggest you wait for a box set or something more affordable at least.",1417996800,31,557,4.1192660550458715

8661783,1,B00KUDUTVM,"Literally, all episodes but 25 are available on Netflix and crunchy roll. If you have to, just buy the 5th part of this collection so you can see the last episode. That's what's I'm considering",1471219200,,193,4.542857142857143
8661784,1,B00KUDUTVM,"Yeah $60 for 4 episodes is a really good idea......SAID NO ONE EVER !!!! And they wonder why they won't make any money. You can stream this for free. I'll never understand why they charge so much for so little, this release is so ridiculous. Sucks because this is an amazing anime and I'd love to own it on blu ray but the price is outrageous and the fact they split the episodes into 4 a dvd case?? What sense does that make? I might as well start collecting vhs tapes again and that'd still be taking up less space than this show when you collect all of them for well over $100. Thumbs down. Fail",1462406400,,598,4.163793103448276
8661785,5,B00KUDUTVM,"An impressive debut from Studio TRIGGER, this is a simple story of revenge, mixed with high school drama, sci-fi overtones, and screwball comedy (mainly from the best friend/sidekick of our heroine).  There is plenty of fan service and nosebleeds (see the cover), but don't let that discourage you.  The academy is as much military camp and fascist dictatorship as a high school, and the special uniforms are the key to the domination of all Japan.  Enter the cover girl Ryuuko, who comes with two things: a gigantic scissor blade and the burning desire to know who used it to kill her father.  She's not the type to take ____ from anyone, but these uniform-wearing students are tougher than anyone she's seen.. But she soon evens the odds with a suit of her own (no matter how skimpy it looks), and even the school council president has to get in on the (exhibitionist) act.

Pull the TRIGGER on this, and remember why you love anime so much!",1454544000,,943,4.656626506024097

8661788,1,B00KUDUTVM,i don't care how good this anime is its not worth almost 60 bucks for 4 measly episodes or 360 for the entire series once u buy everything,1431993600,6,138,3.9642857142857144
8661789,3,B00KUDUTVM,Great movie but I was under the impression that it was the full season 1 not just 4 episodes for 44 dollars.,1426032000,7,108,3.9545454545454546
8661790,1,B00KUDUTVM,"The series itself is five stars, but the release (like many Aniplex products) leaves a lot to be desired. Each set costs $40-60 and there are five sets total, which means in the end customers are going to wind up paying $200-300 for about twenty-five episodes.

When you consider the fact that companies like Funimation and Viz will only charge you $15-60 for a set containing roughly twenty-five episodes, this is absolutely ludicrous and there's really no excusing it. To make matters worse, Aniplex doesn't allow many of their shows (Kill la Kill currently included) to be purchased digitally which means your only legal way to own these shows is to buy them for ridiculous prices like this. I refuse to do it on principle and I honestly think that everyone else should do the same. If we want to see change happen, then hitting Aniplex's wallet is the only option.",1423180800,31,868,4.748344370860927
