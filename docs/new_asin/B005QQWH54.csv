8483607,4,B005QQWH54,"As advertised, the picture quality of this film is considerably less than desirable; there has been no attempt at remastering.

However, the sound quality is acceptable (not great), and since this is a musical, that is really what counts.

The historical value of the film is also not to be overlooked.  It does a pretty good job of summarizing the attitude and music of the WW II era.

It would be nice to have a restored copy, but until one is available (if ever), this one will do.",1368489600,2,484,4.465909090909091
8483608,3,B005QQWH54,"This 1943 Columbia Pictures B-movie musical, based on Jean Ruth Hay's radio show of the same name, features the great Ann Miller, who plays Beverly Ross, a tap-dancing switchboard operator who eventually gets a job hosting an early-morning radio show for the troops. During her show, she introduces the acts, and puts their actual records, with real labels, on the turntable. The performances then morph into short films which, in 1943, were called ""soundies,"" or what would be called music videos today. Among the performers: a young Frank Sinatra, The Mills Brothers, Vernon Alley, a comedy team called The Radio Rogues, who do spot-on impersonations of the radio personalities of the day, and four big bands (Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Bob Crosby, and Freddie Slack, with vocalist Ella Mae Morse, whose ""Cow Cow Boogie"" was one of Capitol Records' first hits - the Capitol Records label is shown in the movie).

And of course, there is Annie Miller herself, showcasing her tapping talents toward the end of the film, with a patriotic ""V For Victory"" dance number, similar to the number that she did years later in 1955's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hit-the-Deck/dp/B0017I3S30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hit the Deck</a>. She was only 20 years old at the time.

While the film is very good, and I applaud Loving The Classics for making it available (I also own the soundtrack CD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reveille-With-Beverly-Jam-Session/dp/B000005L1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reveille With Beverly/Jam Session</a>), the picture quality is poor, and looks as though it was taped off of someone's TV, then transferred to a DVD-R.

I do hope that Sony Pictures Entertainment eventually gives this film a proper re-release, perhaps through either their made-to-order Choice Collection series, or the Warner Archives-distributed Columbia Classics series. Two Miller films, currently being aired (April 2014) on the getTV digital channel, have already been released this way:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-Out-for-Rhythm/dp/B008I34XZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time Out for Rhythm</a>, through the Choice Collection, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carolina-Blues/dp/B006DHAT8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carolina Blues</a>, through Columbia Classics.

REVEILLE WITH BEVERLY and two other Miller films officially unavailable on DVD -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jam-Session/dp/B00GKL7LUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jam Session</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-West-Young-Lady/dp/B00J0ZU146/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go West, Young Lady</a>&nbsp;- are also being aired on getTV, and the prints are from Sony Pictures Television, which owns getTV, so perhaps official DVDs of these three films are not far off.

My overall rating for REVEILLE WITH BEVERLY: 4 stars for the movie itself, but only 2 stars for picture quality, which averages out to 3 stars.",1362182400,3,3156,6.979746835443038
