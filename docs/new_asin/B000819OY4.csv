8055208,3,B000819OY4,"This, the final item from a cut-rate series of six called ""Gangsters - - Then and Now"", is assembled from several sources by Diamond Entertainment and named """"Hollywood Gangsters"" upon the video box but given the title ""Movie Mobsters"" in the film, a generally interesting piece that periodically makes a point that the outcome of these pictures is not in doubt, as ""crime does not pay"", a theme established in the early days of Hollywood and only slightly modified since.  Footage of actual gangsters at work and play serves as preface, with clips depicting such as Al Capone, John Dillinger, Lucky Luciano and Joe Valachi, followed by lengthy trailers and scenes from feature films wherein these and other unappetizing figures are portrayed, albeit with scant attention to reality, connections being made for Humphrey Bogart as Dillinger, James Cagney as Dion O'Bannion, and both Paul Muni and Edward G. Robinson serving as ""Scarface"" Al Capone proxies.  The narration is capably written, Bogart having the greatest amount of screen coverage, including well-known sequences from PETRIFIED FOREST, HIGH SIERRA, KEY LARGO (along with Robinson) and, not surprisingly, THE ROARING TWENTIES (together with Cagney), mention being made that it was at the insistence of Leslie Howard that the American actor was cast in FOREST, the pair being friends and co-stars upon the New York stage in the original play of Robert E. Sherwood.  Cagney is presented in clips from EACH DAWN I DIE (shared with George Raft) and PUBLIC ENEMY, but it is rather odd that selection of the largest amount of screen time for him in this documenary is as a representative of law enforcement in GREAT GUY wherein he plays as a Weights and Measures Inspector for the City of New York.  Among others included in brief segments are Charles Bronson performing as Machine Gun Kelly, Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty as Bonnie and Clyde, in addition to, as matriarch of the infamous Barker clan, Shelley Winters as Ma Barker.  There are even links made between organized crime in the United States and two of Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures: DOCTOR NO and GOLDFINGER, and there are brief looks at Baby Face Nelson, Eliot Ness, and Robert DeNiro in a still from THE GODFATHER.  Although little is accomplished in any original sense with this compendium, it entertains, and will repay the viewing of most devotees of cinema.",1128816000,,2389,5.035443037974684
