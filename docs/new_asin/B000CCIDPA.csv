8097259,2,B000CCIDPA,"Unfortunately, it presents a very inaccurate (and damning) portrayal of Karaite Jews. For this reason I am marking it as 'don't like it'. The movie presents a lot of good information about Rambam but then starts to go into the same misguided stereotypes of Karaites, where it stays for far too long. Beware-a lot of what is said about Karaites simply isn't true. Even a small amount of research uncovers the factual errors.",1498694400,,423,4.808219178082192
