Story revolves around an old lady (Meena Kumari) who is trying to make peace between two gangs. Vinod Khanna is the leader of one gang, but a very kindhearted person. Flashback story of his and his lost love Yogita Bali was the best thing in the whole movie, that turns his life upside down. Shatrughan Sinha is the leader of other gang. The move shows lots of street wars between these gangs. Meena Kumari cares for all of them, and teaches them to stop fighting, and make friendship with each other. Performance wise Vinod Khanna is best among all as a heartbroken lover and gang leader, Shatrughan Sinha also did his best. Meena Kumari was excellent in such a brief role. Supporting cast includes Paintal, Asrani, Dannie, Yogita Bali, did their best. Direction of Gulzar was perfect.",1305849600,,1051,4.717391304347826
