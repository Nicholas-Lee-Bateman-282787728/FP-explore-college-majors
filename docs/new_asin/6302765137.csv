7831017,4,6302765137,It gets three stars just for having the best cover ever made for a movie. The other star is for making me laugh for 90 Min.,1291507200,,123,3.769230769230769
7831018,5,6302765137,"Sometimes the stars just align perfectly don't they? Sid the Elf's weekly B feature was one of those examples this time around. We got the privlige--no the honor of viewing Ninja Vengeance and it could not have turned out better. This flick is B personified. Without any facts, we guessed it was made in 1983. Nope it was '88. And we guessed it was a Dutchman special. Boy, were we wrong. Here's a quick recap: Our main character is passing through wherever the film is set(they never say) on the way to a seminar(on what we have no idea). He witnesses the town's KKK faction killing a young African-American man. So now he and a local girl become the clan's targets.

Before you start feeling sorry for our hero, it is revealed that this guy's got it. He is a former ninjitsu student under sensei Bill Vila, Bob's brother. He throws 7 different kinds of smoke and has moves that would make a young Bruce Lee shake in his boots. He eludes the klansmen and obviously the first thing he does is gets on his bike and gets out of town right? Wrong. The entire sheriff's department shot at this guy and instead of just riding out of there asap, he stays and fights. This is not stupidity. If you had a blonde mullett and could throw roundhouses that should be clocked with a sun dial, you'd stay to teach a lesson too. We would never speak a bad word about the legendary Mike Norris, but this film predates&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;and our hero covers himself lightly in mud for camouflage AND does an astounding FIVE unnecessary shoulder rolls. Stunning.

A few more things are worth mentioning with this movie. The sherrif was brilliant. He was Sid's favorite, especially when he got shot and he had his shirt on, then had it off completely in the very next shot. Just a powerful piece of cinematography. We also loved Bernie Kosar as the deputy who was in love with the local girl because he reminded us of check in the barn and burning house in a riveting sequence. We'd love to tell you more about this movie, but we spent an inordinate ammount of time trying to decide if the girl was hot or fat. The film warrants an ""N"" because of her and we still couldn't decide. Oh well. We loved this one and definitely would have years ago. It may get multiple Woody awards and is a lock for Best Original Score.",1252368000,8,2425,4.716981132075472
7831019,1,6302765137,"Being a fan of Stephen Hayes, I was excited to see his name on this in what seemed to be a ninja vs the Ku Klux Klan.  Minutes into the movie, my instinct told me it would be a loser when it opened up with an overweight topless woman changing.  What does this have to do anything? I asked myself.  Next followed a sorry excuse for a hero with no combative skill, athletic ability or common street sense whatsoever.  What the heck was he doing in this supposed ninja training?  A junior high kid track athlete would have put this ""hero"" to shame.  Ninja Vengeance was a misleading title, since there was obviously no real ninja doing much of anything.  It should have been called ""Blundering Youth Stumbles Across Rednecks"". The acting and dialogue was as cheesy as something a double digit IQ person would have inspired. You end up not really caring much about any of the characters in this film. Don't waste your time.",1067299200,3,919,4.5
7831020,1,6302765137,"The bulk of ""Ninja Vengeance"" contains neither ninjas, nor vengeance.  What it *does* contain is something you don't want to see.  The action is... umm... yeah.  But at least they have the decency to explain away the hero's OBVIOUS lack of any fighting skill whatsoever, in a flashback to his master, who tells him ""Once you go out into the world, you will have to adapt your fighting style to the situation at hand.  When you are a true ninja, your fighting will adapt so much that it no longer looks anything like ninjitsu"".  Well, he's right about that.  The fighting looks absolutely nothing like *any* martial art I've ever seen.
But the highlight of ""Ninja Vengeance"" has to be the absolute incompetence of the lead character--not just in his fighting, but in anything else he tries to accomplish as well.  Ever seen a ninja warrior shout out ""I'm just a student!  I don't want to fight you!  Leave me alone!""???  Well, I've seen it--in ""Ninja Vengeance"".  I can also say that I'd never before seen a ninja (or *anyone*, for that matter) who can be snuck up on by a pickup driving offroad... through the woods... at night... with it's lights on... with drunken rednecks sitting in the truck bed screaming their heads off.  But I saw it in ""Ninja Vengeance"".  But this is the man who uses his advanced stealth and sensory abilities to such a high degree that he can walk out of a forest into an open field ten feet from a redneck deputy with a shotgun and... oh, wait, he didn't know the deputy was there, and the redneck saw him.  Any time the ninja gets out-stealthed by his love interest, you know something is wrong.  Notice a pattern here?
This movie is what ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" would have been if you took away the General Lee and replaced Bo and Luke with Screech from ""Saved By the Bell"".",1013299200,4,1804,4.507692307692308
7831021,3,6302765137,"This movie is one of the only true ""ninja"" movies i have found.  It has StephenK. Hayes in cameo work which authenticates the action.  The movie isn't that great but gives an accurate portrayal of the bujinkan  system and philosophy and has some of the most realistic fighting sequences  ever filmed for ninjutsu.  I recommend it to anyone who only knows the  myths about this art.",939600000,6,381,4.696969696969697
