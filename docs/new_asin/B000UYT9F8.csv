2927217,1,B000UYT9F8,Total waste of time and money.  Don't be fooled like I was with the cool picture of the band.  Not high quality video footage at all.  Save your money.  Invest in Don Felder's book instead.  'Heaven and Hell'...,1211846400,13,211,4.447368421052632
2927218,3,B000UYT9F8,"Even though I love the Eagles music and I am from the 70's, I was disappointed in the DVD because I thought it would have old clips of them singing.  The interviews were interesting but I wanted to see the long hair, mustaches and fantastic vocals in their songs.  I am keeping the DVD however, because I have their reunion tape on VHS and also have since gottom their Desperado dvd so it will be added to my ""stuff"" regarding the ""Greatest Group in music history"".  There has been no other group since or before that have the vocals these guys do, Period.  I have been trying for years to go to a concert of theirs, but since I live up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it has been very hard.  I am still hoping that they come up this way, I would go as far as Chicago or Milwaukee to see these guys no matter what the cost!  LOVE THEM!  Nancy Hansen",1198886400,11,853,4.164634146341464

I'm thrilled that it ncludes the bands induction into the Rock & Roll hall of fame a moment I thought was lost to tmie. Only thing is it seemed to be too much Don Henly And Glen Frey. I'm syill very greatfull to have this DVD",1198368000,5,468,6.2153846153846155
2927220,3,B000UYT9F8,"The content of this DVD is actually very good. The interviews are in depth, and cover a lot of history, song development, relations amongst the members of the band, outside band activities (i.e. worthy causes, etc.), etc. Each interview is an individual interview with either Don Henley or Glenn Frey.

Also, there is a segment on the band's induction into the hall of fame, and then a final interview (which is very good in video quality) of the entire band during their first reuinion tour (around 1994).

So the overall content (subject matter) is good. However, and this is a big ""however, the video quality leaves much to be desired. Especially the first interview with Glenn Frey and Bob Costas (even the sound quality is not great on this interview). Because the quality is not all that great, and the sound on the first Glenn Frey interview is poor as well, the price of the DVD should not be so high. $12.99 or lower would have been a much better price for this DVD (strickly due to quality).

However, if you are a huge Eagles fan then you will want to get this DVD (if you are willing to pay the sticker price), for the content alone it is worth getting.

[Update on 4/13/2009 - I have noticed that since I originally wrote this review, the price of the DVD has dropped to $9.99. That's good to see, and the DVD is worth that price.]",1196467200,30,1344,4.473469387755102
2927221,5,B000UYT9F8,"Like I said above this is probably the best set of interviews with The Eagles I've seen. It is two hours worth of footage with the band where they discuss the songs, both old and new, among various other things.

I was very pleased with this purchase... expected something so good to cost a lot more.",1196380800,9,300,4.357142857142857
2927222,1,B000UYT9F8,"If I see a picture of these five guys I expect to see interviews with every single one of them. There is nothing by Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon or Don Felder. Brainwashing claptrap!",1390608000,2,182,4.545454545454546
2927223,2,B000UYT9F8,Boring interviews with talk show hosts. I thought it was that documentary everyone was talking about. Not this one.  I'm very unimpressed.,1384387200,,138,5.2727272727272725

2927225,4,B000UYT9F8,"Fun to watch these older interviews including the induction into the R&R Hall of Fame.  Gives you another perspective on the story of this amazing  band. If you're a real fan, you will really enjoy seeing many of these interviews that might not have been shown in your area before. Revisiting the history is a good time!",1373328000,2,320,4.5964912280701755
2927226,1,B000UYT9F8,"Very misleading. The interviews were of Grey and Henley only.  I guess Don Felder was right about the ""Gods"" controlling everything that came out of the Eagles machine.
Hated it!!!",1366329600,,180,5.0

2927230,4,B000UYT9F8,"We thought it would have more interviews with other band members.  It was mainly Don Henley.

It was an interesting group of recordings and clips, just not as diverse as we were looking for.",1226275200,13,190,4.5588235294117645
2927231,3,B000UYT9F8,"I was extremely interested in watching this DVD after reading Don Felder's autobiography, Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles. Unfortunately, Don Henley and Glenn Frey glossed over all the ""troubles"" within the band over the years and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't much in the way of interviews with the other band members, i.e. Don Felder, Timothy B Schmit and Joe Walsh. Having said that, overall I enjoyed the DVD but would have liked to have heard more about the band from Henley rather than the Waldon Woods Project.",1215475200,15,540,4.75531914893617
