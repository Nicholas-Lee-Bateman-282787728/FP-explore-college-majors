No, it's not the highest quality, but it's also not the worst. You CAN clearly see everything and it's so interesting to see what has changed at Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party over the years. It's a souvenir that you cannot buy at Disney World and simply fun to watch!",1393718400,,438,4.353658536585366

only complaint is the grainy video, wish it was better quality....but it works! We missed the fireworks and after seeing the DVD we know to never do that again!! it was fantastic!!! can't wait to go back and we have watched this video about 20 times!!",1326758400,,377,4.178082191780822
8425110,5,B004DBYCGK,"My family had a fantastic time visiting Disney for their Halloween celebration. Since departing, we have such great talks reminiscing about the Halloween parade and fireworks. This is a fantastic way for us to relive the vacation. I also recommend this DVD for those thinking of going for the first time. Gives an excellent viewpoint of the holiday celebrations. Nothing takes the place of being there in person, but this DVD gives a great representation of the fun you had, or will have!",1315958400,,488,4.891566265060241
8425111,3,B004DBYCGK,"This captures halloween at Disney World just short of being there. The Boo to you halloween parade is a tad dark. The fireworks is excellent, and the Villains Mix and Mingle is the highlight.",1308787200,,191,4.647058823529412
