8178305,5,6303920349,"Fine editing, with one exquisite montage of stunning Kim Delaney lecturing to policemen about the perp's MO while we keep cutting to the perp executing the very things Delaney is talking about, done in precision timing. Also, a seductive Pam Grier in a riveting performance as police chief  not long before her career was resurrected by Tarantino. David's second delving into the world of directing makes us long for more films from his assured and deft hand.",1472342400,,459,4.961038961038961
8178306,4,6303920349,"Fans of Tobin Bell are strongly advised to purchase 'Serial Killer,' in which Bell plays a highly intelligent psychopath who stalks a special agent - with rather unexpected intentions.
As a whole, the film is sub-par with regards to acting, but this does not apply to Bell, who steals scene after scene with his powerful presence and spot-on delivery. One may even argue that this is the best performance of his career, second only to that of John Kramer of the 'Saw' series.
Although difficult to find (especially if you require DVD format), 'Serial Killer' is worth the search.",1296432000,8,579,4.858585858585859
