536894,3,6303047025,"My review isn't about the movie itself but really about the other revews. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie, I thought it was ALOT better than the second one but not as good as the orignal, wich gets me to my point. After  reading the other reviews for this movie I have to disagree when people say  the first 2 were ""wittiy"". Sure the second one seemed to be more  of a comedy but I think it is totally inapproiat to say Return Of The  Living Dead 1 is ""witty"". I mean come on it has to be one of the  best ""zombie"" movies ever made and most definatlly the best cult  classic to this date. So please next time somone even thinks of calling  this movie ""witty"" think agian you half-wit.",937785600,,689,4.097014925373134
536895,5,6303047025,"This movie has creeps & scares especially the tall zombie that goes crazy in the beginning, but it is also a great love story. I love it for it's scares & delightful moments as well as my favorite actress,the  most beautiful woman in the world, Melinda Clarke!",930614400,,260,4.531914893617022
536896,3,6303047025,"The film has a great story line of undying love but the film should have been made on it's own, not as part of a series.  The first two films were funny and witty, while this film is too dark.  The  makeup effects on the  girl were really great but the zombies just looked like they were made of  play dough.",929491200,,308,3.9836065573770494
536897,3,6303047025,"Not a bad film...but a bad sequel.
ROTLD 3 is, of course the sequel to the great ROTLD and the okay ROTLD 2.
But this sequel is far different from the first two. The first two films were comedy/horror films, and  worked very well.
ROTLD 3, however, is darker in tone, and has no comic  relief. Also, many elements are missing, including the infamous James Karen  and Thom Matthews, and the greasy ""tar man.""
That's why  ""Return 3"" falls short of acheiving the great atmosphere the  first two flicks had.
The movie is pretty entertaining, if not somewhat  disappointing.",922492800,,569,4.696969696969697

537056,3,6303047025,"You know you're watching a B movie when not just a side character but the main character always does the most senseless thing whenever possible and when not possible does ordinary things the most senseless way.  The lead male hero, a teenager, makes every dumb teenager who ever lived look in possession of the wisdom of a God by comparison.

If you can grit your teeth through the extremely unlikely dumbness and plotholes, as well as the gore and ridiculous racial stereotypes, there are some fun monster moments.  You won't remember this movie with fondness over the years and one day yearn to see it once again, but it's some light and completely mindless gross fun.  Good enough to watch all the way through, but not good enough that you wouldn't take a phone call, yap with your friends, or hop in and out of the room without bothering to hit the pause button.",1493942400,,866,4.603896103896104

537058,3,6303047025,It is an okay addition to the series but it also happens to be unnecessarily gory. The experiments being performed are a bit too brutal. Riverman didn't deserve all the things they did to him. Just no.,1493510400,,201,4.45945945945946

537092,4,6303047025,"A much better zombie love story than ""warm bodies"" ever could be. Lets face it... ""Warm Bodies"" was basically twilight but for zombies, and unlike that movie, this movie had a plot, internal struggle and antagonists that made sense! yeah, its cheesy, but really, I dare you to find a better zombie love story than this! Loving the dead is always going to be tragic and messed up, and this movie acknowledged that in many ways that made it both awesome, and sad. A movie concept ahead of its time, but also stuck to its guns and made the ride both influential and fun. 4 stars!",1492387200,,576,4.443396226415095

537095,5,6303047025,A great zombie movie. Often I'm not much on sequels. However it's like another chapter to the franchise. Just a fun movie.,1491523200,,122,4.590909090909091
537096,4,6303047025,"One of the best Z-movies I have seen in a long time. Guess what? It actually has a plot and a story. It was very cute that the couple's love endured through zombification so you almost forget that these are the two brats that caused the whole disaster in the first place. You will also enjoy Riverman, a cool homeless guy with an admirable outlook on life and who is also perfectly groomed, which is not common among those residing in the sewers, even a well-illuminated and cozy three bedroom sewer home like his that is more spacious than most New York apartments. The zombies themselves are well-costumed and made up and very scary and creepy especially the canned zombies, which had been previously preserved by an exclusive vacuum-packing method. There is even an evil, antagonist who looks like a cross between Nurse Rachet and Hillary Clinton. Something for everybody.",1491350400,4,875,4.84

537172,5,6303047025,"Lionsgate finally gives the 1993 horror cult classic ""Return of the Living Dead 3"" the red carpet treatment for its long overdue blu-ray release under their lauded Vestron Video Collector's Series label. Even better the version contained on this disc is the unrated director's cut and not the heavily censored R rated version which had been released years ago on DVD.

The film is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and looks pretty good overall. While a massive improvement over the ancient DVD release, the blu-ray transfer looks a bit soft in places but overall sports nice detail and strong colors. The bit rate is healthy staying in the upper 20's so no compression artifacts are to be seen. This is probably the best the film has ever looked and fans should be pleased. Everything is contained on a dual layer disc. Audio is presented in lossless 2 channel stereo and sounds quite punchy throughout with nice definition.

Extras are as follows and are quite extensive with the commentary tracks ported from the DVD release while everything else is new.

It is the same as my unrated VHS... And a friend of mine called me up and told me his Blu-ray ""unrated"" came in the mail that day... He asked me to bring my dvd over to his house... And we watched both of them back to back... They are the same movie... Now the dvd on the cover says its rated ""R""... But it is wrong... the ""DVD"" is 1 hour and 37 minutes... Just like the Blu-ray. Now this movie is different than the 1st two movies. But to me this one is the best of the 3 movies...Its a Great film...

537304,4,6303047025,"Here we finally have the unrated cut of this cult classic sequel on Blu-ray. The 3rd entry in the Return of the Living Dead series take departure from the more horror/comedy focus of 1 & 2 and becomes a more serious in tone horror film with some romantic elements thrown in for good measure. The zombies also function a bit differently then in the previous 2 films & can now also infect through bites. Basic story is a boy & his girlfriend plan to leave town, get into an accident, he uses the chemical at his dads army base to bring her back & I'm sure you can guess what happens from there. The cast wasn't bad at all, some really great blood & gore sfx as well. If you are a fan of the other 2 RotLD films definitely give this one a try (skip parts 4 & 5 though, they're horrible). Special features include commentaries, interviews, galleries & trailers. Fans of zombie films will find a lot to like in this one & unlike the older DVD that had the R rated cut this BD from Vestron Video contains the unrated cut.",1482537600,,1015,4.237113402061856

I just got my Return of the Living Dead 3 Blu-ray in the mail today and I must say aside from the awesome glossy slipcover its rather Unacceptable!!....it feels like you're holding something prestigious in your hand but once you take the slipcover off and you feel that cheap eco case it makes it feel like a cheap 5dollar Blu-ray from the dump bins of Wal-Mart. Like I said the slipcover is beautiful but it's super prone to fingerprints and it's already annoying the piss out of me. Add to the fact that there isn't reversible artwork or even a booklet inside make it all underwhelming

These are just way overpriced blurays imo. These are $15 releases tops... they charge more than vinegar syndrome and they do less. Cheap low effort Eco cases ",1481587200,,798,4.496551724137931

537308,5,6303047025,I will make this short and sweet but return three was the best of the entire run of that series.  More than that is a great horror film with a doomed romance at the center of it written by a great John are rider John Penney and directed with great skill by Brian use no more than that is a great horror film with a doomed romance at the center of it written by a great John are rider John Penney and directed with great skill by Brian Yuzna.  There are many people have previous editions of this copy so I will simply highlight the changes  The Gore that was cut from the very initial release and probably not seen in 20 years is all restored here and the practical effects are shockingly well done.  The story works like clockwork and has very little to do with the previous two films except for that gas that is bringing the dead to life  otherwise this is a crystal clear most beautiful transfer of the film I have ever seen and it probably looks better now than it did in the theater  The two point no HD soundtrack sounds just like the movie and is really really one of the better 2.0s I've heard in a long time the supplements are very long and generous including a great conversation between director and writer and the commentary track on the film itself by the director and many many more supplements I can't simply say enough about this release  if you are at all a fan of either the genre the series was just looking for a great  90s horror flick that is less on laughs and more on the psychological Tara along with incredible gore  this movie is for you and I could not recommend it higher,1480896000,,1601,4.240131578947368

The blu-ray is fantastic! looks and sounds amazing! Also we finally get a nice handful of special features that are all new. I still recommend buying the R.o.t.

There were also different rates of infection in part 3... some just became mindless zombies... and others were still ""livid sex pots""!

537469,4,6303047025,"Brian Yuzna's Directing outing of the third ROTLD is super under-rated

It's super under-rated and the last good Return of the Living Dead  (Avoid the newer ones Garbage)  Cheap cash-grabs due to  zombies taking over pop culture........ For now anyway
This was made in 1993 where U.S. Horror was as dead as disco!
The film really has nothing to do with the previous two films besides the  the metal barrels  filled with the infamous gas
It has more a Re-Animator vibe all around (mostly due to Brian Yuzna directing)
The film is more serious then the previous two films the tone is dark
But, it also makes the film different and fresh in 1993
The Story is Romeo & Juliet...... Juliet dies and is brought back to life and all hell breaks lose
The Cast is average but,
you have a standout performance by  Melinda Clarke  who plays  Julie Walker  (This is one of her earlier roles) Melinda would go onto to do Spawn, The O.C. ,  C.S.I. ,  Nikita,  and Vegas among much more......
Melinda does a lot of heavy lifting in this film (Her death is jarring and unsettling)
Then she has all the zombie make-up and it all looks stunning! all practical f/x
Melinda is and always will be the original Goth/Suicide Girl it's a shame she doesn't acknowledge this film

It's a very different zombie film still to this day it's not given nearly enough credit or respect

This film was much darker and more serious in tone compared to the previous films.  It does have some pretty disturbing visuals which I find are attributed to the director and his unique style.  I've watched many of his other films and they are hit and miss, yet each film had its own creepy scenes which are stuck in my head.

All in all I did like this movie but I really don't considered it part of the return series.

537675,5,6303047025,"RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3

The first romantic zombie film was indeed this film right here, the third installment of the The Return of the Living Dead series. Before things like Warm Bodies there was this great and highly underrated film. Brian Yuzna did an excellent job here with this film and his direction was great. Of course that makes since coming from the guy who produced or directed some of my favorite films. These include the Re-Animator series, Warlock, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and so on.

The film follows a young couple who are feeling like the world is against them so they want to run off together. But after a motorcycle accident that leaves one of them dead the other sneaks them into a military research facility [his dad works there so it is not too farfetched] to revive her. They had been there before and had witnessed dead bodies being reanimated. Once he accomplishes his goal and after releasing some zombies on accident they make a break for it as the military hunts them down. The only other problem is that since she is now undead she is hungry and craving something a little, human.

This movie is so fun with great effects since I love practical old school effects and make up like this from back in the day. That head sticking up out of the backbone is excellent and just one of the great looks of the film. Honestly anyone who has seen this knows what I am talking about when I say Julie looks crazy good in this film with all the glass and things she does to herself. Speaking of I think Melinda Clarke did a great job in this film as did here co star Trevor did as Curt.

Writer John Penney really was on to something here with this film that predates all these new style of romantic zombie flicks. In fact I would say that even still this film is the best from that style in my opinion as it is not only a story about love and what it can cause you to do but it also deals with consequences. Add in great gore, a few cameos, and some crazy situations and you have one great film.

The DVD comes with four or five trailers from some of the directors films along with a great and informative commentary from him. You also get a production commentary with the second unit director and the star herself Melinda, this one is more fun and story driven. Over all I would recommend this film to any horror fan especially those who love the 80s and 90s films.",1415232000,,2389,4.3355704697986575
537676,5,6303047025,One of my top favorite zombie movies. And one of top teenage love too. LOL.,1414454400,,75,4.066666666666666
537677,4,6303047025,"i watched return of the living dead 3 again. i thoroughly love this movie, and has long been one of my favorites. it speaks to the gothic romantic underpinnings of horror movies, as well the power of performance. to whit, melinda clarke turns in one of horrordom's greatest acting jobs, and makes return of the ling dead 3 a cut above. what it lacks in production values and timelessness, is more than made up with tragic romance.

curt is pissed off at his military dad and intends to runaway with his crazy, livin-on-the-edge girlfriend, especially after they witness dad overseeing some morbid experiments involving the barrel-bound zombies left over from a prior, covered-up outbreak of the undead (told in the original and this installment, as that thing ""that happened in '69""). when, predictably, they wreck and julie is killed, a heartbroken curt really has only one option, the sort of option that dan cain or louis creed could have advised him never turns out well. it is from this point that the movie becomes something really special.

melinda clarke is really amazing. she absolutely captures what it must be like to be re-animated, not really know wtf is going on, and be filled with gnawing hunger. there are sequences where she goes from desperate and sad, to hungry and violent, to cold and sick. to combat her urges--and preserve her love for curt--she begins self-mutilating, driving nails and hooks and metal coils into her flesh. the pain distracts her from her hunger. she is so good, she is really the main event in this movie, beautiful and grotesque, sad and scary. her scenes with curt, played ably, if not whinily by j. trevor edmons, are excellent, and she just totally inhabits this roll. strong support from sturdy sarah douglass and kent mccord rounds out a professional cast. i also liked the character river man, played by basil wallace, who lives in the sewers, helps out our heroes, and dispenses nice chunks of wisdom to julie and curt, especially curt.

return of the living dead 3 isn't perfect, primarily a result of the cheesy, somewhat stereotypic latino gang, who are rarely able to speak without inducing cringes. it's dated in other places and momentarily plodding in others, but otherwise, this is a movie filled with sincere romance, enough plot, and fun make-up effects. steve johnson, fast becoming one of my favorite make-up sfx artists, and a crew that includes luminaries such as wayne toth (who would go on to be rob zombies make-up man) and knb, bring home really gooey, inventive make-ups, and, in particular mindy clarke's make-up is just divine. horrifying and sexy, she's a punk/bondage/sadomasochist/necrophiliac wet dream. that's a good thing.

at it's heart, return of the living dead is a movie about letting go, and it ends exactly as it should. it is notable for a virtuoso performance and really fun effects. brian yuzna and john penney, bring this movie home, and, as a companion piece to bride of re-animator, yuzna cements his position as the king of gooey romance. shakespeare's got nuthin on him, romeo and juliet nuthin on this flick. this would make an excellent valentine's day movie, to watch with your loved one. hold them tight. but not too tight.",1408752000,,3222,4.906422018348624

537777,4,6303047025,"This movie is probably the best 1990s B movie/low budget horror movie made in its time. Today it still holds its own as a stand alone film. It dosent matter if you haven't seen the other 2. The other 2 films were horror comedies with some gore. This one however is strictly true horror. It deals with the questions of what would happen to your mind if you became a zombie. Its best to call these zombies government mutant bio weapons. One thing the film does is introduce the military exoskeleton sytem, which the military uses today.  It also makes you think about what type of experiments the government is doing and how far they can push the boundaries before its considered too much. The film has love, passion, lust, depravity, decay, paranoiya, sickening gore, and spine chilling practicle effects. No CGI was used in this film. Probably the last horror movie that had only practicle effects.

Special features:
Directors commentary
Cast commentary
Trailers

The reason I negated a star was for the fact that the movie was rated R and the unrated original release is still only on VHS. So if you have the VHS i would recommend that you hang onto it. The R rated version only cuts out some of the more political inncorect gore, and some of the more bloody and piercing scenes. No dialogue is missing as far as i know.

About the cast:
Mindy Clarke- she could have easily been a playboy centerfold for the 90s. Her acting is top notch and she sells the whole idea of the horror of being dead and brought back to please her boyfriend. some guys are Guilty of forcing their ideas on their girlfriends and the girls usually goes along. thats what her acting potrays very effectivly.
J.Trevor Edmond- he portays the consequence of forcing your girlfriend into doing something your girlfriends don't want to do but do it anyway to please the boyfriend. His acting is pretty good and he sells the feeling of what its like to lose someone you love and don't want to let go but have to.
Basil Wallace- now this guys acting is far better than any i have ever seen in horror films. He plays a poor homeless ""riverman"" that only wants to help people out and do good in life but is cought up in the horror of governmental weaponization subdermal mechanical bio human control and is being forced to do things that in his mind would be horror. Its like hes waking up to his worst nightmare and he totally sells it in his eyes. I mean what other actor can sell all those emotions with only their eyes.

Hats off to the director and makeup effects artists as all story line and effects are top notch for a B movie. Hech the effects are good on an A list horror movie with monster budgets. This film is in my opinion the last great horror movie of the 90s. and because it still holds up alone today i would say its a classice B movie that should be ranked up there with dawn of the dead and the evil dead. I hope to see a fully restored unrated remastered bluray version of this film. I hope you found this review helpful and i would very highly recomend this movie to people that have paranoiya about government zombie experiments and zombie love story.

537781,4,6303047025,"This 90's gem is an entry into the ""Return of the Living Dead"" franchise directed by the madman behind ""Beyond Re-Animator"" and ""Faust:  Love of the Damned"",  Brian Yuzna.

It starts when teenage army brat Curt sneaks onto his father's base with his goth chippy girlfriend Julie (Melinda Clarke, soon to be famous or infamous as the dominatrix Lady Heather in a recurring role on CSI and before that a regular in the young-adult soap The OC).  The two of them witness a dead corpse being brought back to life by Trioxin gas and boogey on out of there without Curt's pops ever knowing they were there.  (They don't witness the subsequent carnage as the military folks unsucsessfully attempt to subdue the zombie).  Curt is freaked out, but his freak of a girl thinks it's groovy.

Curt has a fight with his pops and he and Jules impulsively decide to run away together.  But she gets a lil' bit killed when he has an accident on his motorcycle, and, distrught at the possibility of going on without her, he sneaks her back onto the base and uses the trioxin to revive her lovely but now dead body.

Julie wakes up with a ravenous appetite and realizes what she really craves when she impulsively bites a gang member (and, of course, zombifies him).

Chaos and gore ensues, with Julie ultimately transforming herself into a Pierced Zombie Goddess with help from FX maestro Steve Johnson (the idea being that, she discovers early on that physical pain is the one thing that can control her craving for brains/flesh/blood and she ultimately takes this to the max).

Highly recommended for zombie/gore fans.

this IS the UNRATED VERSION if you have the Lionsgate (R)

dvd... The gore and runtime is the same as the UNRATED

VHS... If you are familiar with Brian Yuzna, then you know

to expect some good gore. His approach here is very

serious and not following the spoof/comedy motif of the

previous two ROTLD. This movie could pretty much be its

own film had it not used the idea of eating brains and

Trioxin. IMO it is well done and the gore scenes are

really nice considering this was shot for under a mil.

The commentary is great, like you get to find out the the

skinny laboratory zombie was a bum off the

street who demanded more money and a limousine during

shooting or he would quit half way through lol.

Watching the movie, you'll notice right away that this movie bears little resemblance to the first two movies in the series. It drops the comedy of those films, and replaces it with a more horror & science-fiction aspect, and a dark romantic theme. Its' zombies run rather than walking or limping and are not fixed on eating brains. Despite those differences, fans accept this movie as part of the series' canon.

Personally, I liked the movie myself and liked the direction that the series 'seemed' to be heading. However, when you read my reviews for the remaining two movies in the series, you'll see I was quite displeased with them..especially with them being Return of the Living Dead movies. I do recommend this movie even though it bears little resemblance to the first two movies. It is a good movie.",1348531200,,1557,4.762962962962963
537852,5,6303047025,"This brings me back! An old classic from the 90's! This one never got old for me. Its 1993 but we still feel the strong horror influence of  the end of the 80's with all the Gore, Sex and Rock and Roll those classics had. Return of The living Dead 3 is probably one of the best living Dead/Zombie Movies ever made in the 90's and its definitely Mr Bryan Yuzna's masterpiece.

Unlike its 2 predecessors, ROTLD 3  has a very serious tone to it, the comedy and jokes are now gone but the plot is still as interesting as the first two and Zombie fans won't be disappointed. The TRIOXIN gas is now the subject of a study for the United States Army in order to create new weapons for war. Scientifics are now trying to see if they can use the gas on dead bodies and turned them into powerful and almost invincible killing machines. Unfortunately, they don't know how unstable the gas can be yet. On  a different angle, Col. John's Reynold son (Curt) is about to find out about the gas and what it can do when is girlfriend Julie and him get into a motorcycle accident, resulting in Julie breaking her neck and dying  instantly. Having seen what the gas can do, Curt will try to bring his girlfriend back to life, at his own risk....

For horror and zombie fans this movie should be a real treat. Good plot, well executed, definitely gory, with plenty of action and good moments. Mindy Clarke is absolutely amazing in the role of Julie and will make you laugh at some times, and completely repulse you at others. The cinematography was good and some of those zombies were just amazing! Definitely a must for any zombie fans.

537853,2,6303047025,"I just watched this movie for the second time, in many, many years. I first saw it when it first came out, and I remember I did not like it back then. I recently found out a 4th and 5th installment where made, so I decided to check out the first 3 to refresh my memory before checking out 4 & 5. Well, I only recalled bits and pieces, but yup, same conclusion as all those years ago when I first saw it. This time around, some army guys are experimenting with the zombie chemicals from the barrels (as in the barrels from the first two movies). One of the scientists on the team's on steals his security card and breaks into the facility with his girlfriend to find out what they are doing there. They discover his father is using the chemical to bring back the dead, and to experiment on a way to destroy them when they do reanimate.

The son ends up having an argument with his father, and he runs away with his girlfriend on his motorbike. However, they have a bike accident that kills his girlfriend. And in desperation he takes her body to the facility and brings her back using the zombie chemical. Now she is back, but she is a zombie, and she too wants brains. And anyone she bites, will become a zombie too.

Out of all the 4 ROTLD movies, this one is my least favorite. That's including parts 4 & 5. In each of the movies, there are some pretty lame scenes and acting, but this one seems to take the cake. Mostly it comes from the starring zombie role of whomever she is playing her. She really does and acts in some pretty nauseating ways. Some say this was the goriest version of the 5 movies. But you know what, I don't care, gore does not make a movie great. This one's ending was the worst of them all too. Even tho it stayed more truer to the first two movies then the next two, it still had moments of WTF about it. Why bother to do this, only to end up like this and that, seeing the movie for yourself, you will understand what I mean by that.

In my collection, sometimes I like to just have all the movies to complete a collection, but sometimes I make an exception, and I would never have bothered to purchase Robocop 3 or Police Academy 7 had they not come in box sets with all the movies. If the Return of the Living Dead came in a box set, I would have bought it, provided it contained all 5 movies, or parts 2 to 5 or whatever, but these movies are all individual, and I am glad I did not pay money for this 3rd movie with it's horrible made in the early 90's stupid futureistic-wanna-be silo facilities with fluorescent stage lighting with Star Trek sliding doors all the place that are supposed to be top secret facilities. Also in this film, you have come to expect to see zombies come back from the dead, in bone and flesh form, but this movie failed to bring anyone dead back apart from the main girl. Everyone else was just infected by a bite and the best you get is a guy with his dead on his exposed spine. It really felt like they had a small budget and this film was not all it could have been visually. And again, they really needed some better actors, most where just annoying and did not take their roles serious enough to pull off a great B-grade horror comedy.",1327104000,,3201,4.201626016260162

The movie isn't exactly an original story, but I let ROTLD3 get away with it because to my knowledge (and I could be wrong, but I've watched a lot of zombie movies) the series is the originator of the ""virus/chemical"" scenario reviving the dead.

The last two movies in this series that were made in russia were a huge drop in quality but that's another story. Still this one is a good zombie movie with great effects and good acting so that is a plus. This should be put on the same blu ray with part 2 and that would be a great deal.

They are trying to cure her, it is touching because even though she is a zombie girl who can't stop killing and does some impromptu body piercings that makes her own body a weapon he still loves her. This film is campy and I love it. Yeah if you are into some crazy films like me well this is one that you need. One thing is as a zombie she still can talk like she would as a human.

537966,4,6303047025,"Zombies, gore, romance, humor, a hobo and a redhead -- ""Return of the Living Dead 3"" has got it all.

Tweaking the formula a bit, this third entry in the series started by the late, great Dan O'Bannon plays almost like a zombie-fied Romeo and Juliet. Curt (J. Trevor Edmund) and Julie (Melinda Clarke) are two teenagers madly in love. Although Curt's father -- a prototypical over-bearing authority figure -- doesn't approve, the two seem to have a great life together ahead of them, that is, until tragedy strikes, and the experimental toxin from the previous two films is used to bring Julie back with mixed results. In short, this girl is hungry for love and lusting for blood.

In many ways, this is an improvement over the tepid&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequel/dp/B0002KQNL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequel</a>&nbsp;that preceded it. You can chalk that up to director Brian Yuzna (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-Re-Animator/dp/B00009YXHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of Re-Animator</a>""), whose sci-fi and horror credentials suit the film perfectly. Rather than merely re-hash or dumb down what made the original work so well, Yuzna's film takes chances and has a feeling of freshness that still lingers even today. The characters are just credible enough to sell the romance angle, and the gore, while slightly restrained in the R-rated cut currently on DVD, is as wild as ever. Sure, it has a tendency to sag in its third act, but overall, ""Return of the Living Dead 3"" is an enjoyable if somewhat tragic thrill-ride that is unlike anything else you'll come across. Unfortunately, the series would continue in the form of two underwhelming made-for-TV movies that failed to live up to this superior sequel.",1274572800,,1818,5.680147058823529
537967,3,6303047025,"Coming off of the recent success of the stellar sequel BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, Brian Yuzna was the perfect candidate to helm this third entry in the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD series. 3 is a deviation from the other films in many ways. It offers a much more serious tone with only a few silly moments compared to the comedic nature of the first two installments. It also focuses on a much smaller zombie outbreak, with a single zombie character taking center stage over the massive hordes in the others. A rebellious teen brings his dead girlfriend back to life using the same chemicals his father and the military were experimenting with in an attempt to create an army of undead soldiers. As she slowly re-animates, she finds that self-mutilation and brains are the only two things that can dull the pain of living death. After a promising set-up, the plot is left with no where to go as the leading couple attempts to escape a group of angered gang members and the military by taking to the subterranean sewer system. This destroys all forward momentum as the characters (and the audience) are caught in a tedious game of cat and mouse. While the film often suffers from budgetary constraints and weak plotting, the arresting visuals brought on by the superior make-up and gore create some of the most unique and memorable moments in the series. Julie transforms from every rocker's dream babe in to a necrophile's S+M nightmare with a stunning character design. The tacked on ending also indulges the audience with glimpses of the mechanical bio-weapons that the military has been developing in a closing scene of zombie mayhem. RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3 is built on many strong ideas and excellent effects, but while it is the strongest of the series sequels, it is also a flawed film on many levels.

Curt loves Julie so much that when she is killed he goes down to where his father works and brings her back to life. The only way I remember seeing this is they ran it on sci-fi network and I saw bits and pieces of it. Also, the movie poster is when I remember from my childhood when renting vhs was a part of culture. Anyway, I watched the rater R version of this movie and it really sucked. It looked like they held back so much and i'm hoping to see an uncut dvd of this soon. The main character, Curt, is very annoying and just makes me want to turn this film off. He loves Julie so much and keeps her alive even though she is a zombie. Julie looked hot though and with less then half an hour left, she looked smoking hot in a sick, twisted way. The end of this film made me go wow, what a piece of trash!

537970,5,6303047025,"When his wild girlfriend with a taste for the macabre is killed in a motorcycle accident just after the pair declared their independence from parental authority, Army brat Curt Reynolds takes her corpse back to the military facility they were at just hours earlier. Curt and Julie had snuck into the facility before with a key card stolen from Curt's father, Col. John Reynolds, and they witnessed something there that was nearly impossible to believe. Using a gas called 2-4-5 Trioxin, the U.S. military was experimenting with bringing the dead back to life and attempting to control them for warfare purposes. Initially disgusted that his father was heading up such experiments, Curt now saw the Trioxin gas as his only hope for the future with Julie he had planned. He soon brings Julie back to life, and she is luckily still in her right mind, though many things are definitely wrong with her and she is already extremely hungry and unsure for just what. Things go downhill from there for Curt (well, I guess they went downhill from the point he wrecked his bike and killed his girlfriend), as Julie's rapidly accelerating condition results in an altercation with a local gang; and soon, the gang, the police, and the military are all chasing after them!

Brian Yuzna, the man who gave us the Re-Animator series, tries his hand at directing a Living Dead flick with ""Return of the Living Dead 3"", an odd but excellent addition to the zombie film genre. Many call this film the best in the series (mostly ignoring 4 and 5, which came along later and looked pretty bad), while others call the first film the best. I may be of the rare breed that enjoys part 2 the most, but no doubt, all 3 are fantastic films! Part one puts a more modern spin (well, for the '80's) on the mother of all zombie flicks, ""Night of the Living Dead"", with a lot of punk attitude and a touch of comedy, but still playing out as a legit horror tale. Part 2 tells a similar story (even with returning cast members, seemingly in a parallel universe), and improves upon the first in my opinion by going for a suburban setting and not keeping the characters so confined. What most folks hate about 2 is how much they went for comedy. I don't think the comedy from the living hurt the film at all, but I admit that some of the zombie comedy was a bad idea. Should have kept it to the humans. Still, setting it in the suburbs kept it a scary addition to the series for me. More horror films need to be set in the suburbs. It makes them far more scary for the many folks who live in the suburbs. Anyway, this review is for ""Return of the Living Dead 3"", and part 3 drops the humor angle and plays it straight. For some people, all horror films should be played straight, and those are often the folks heralding this film as one of the best horror films ever. I like both styles of horror, and I loved Return of the Living Dead 3. It is a fantastic film about a doomed romance. Doomed by stupidity all-around, one might say. Stupidity and that recurring chemical that is one of the scariest substances ever dreamed up, 2-4-5 Trioxin.

Return of the Living Dead does have some issues I don't like. For example, self-mutilation is a major theme. The reason I don't like that is because I can't stand to watch it. This won't be a problem for some. The purpose behind it is that pain helps Julie fend off her feeding frenzies, so at one point she really goes all out with it and comes out looking like a super-zombie seductress. Not for me, but I guess that turns on some people, ha. The film also doesn't have hordes of zombies running around, so it's not all that scary to me, but it still has its moments. For such a low budget film, it has great effects and tells its story more than sufficiently. It's a horrific and enjoyable ride, and certainly it's an original story for the genre. Even if it's not my fave of the big 3 Return of the Living Dead flicks, I most definitely recommend it. Unfortunately for those of us who prefer to get the most complete version of any film, only the R rated version is available on DVD. It's funny, but this is often complained about in the two DVD commentaries that are extras on the disc. The film gets a widescreen presentation and theatrical trailer, plus some other interesting horror trailers, and the commentaries are one with director Brian Yuzna and the other with star Mindy (Melinda) Clarke and Thomas Rainone, the special effects production supervisor and second unit director. The Yuzna commentary is enjoyable and informative, but the other is more lively. The pair do interrupt each other a lot though, which can be annoying for the viewer as well, ha. Incindentally, many folks love this movie largely because they have a thing for the zombie femme fatale, Melinda Clarke. That's cool, but the makeup (I'm assuming it was make-up) used on her in this film, and I mean during her pre-zombie scenes, just made her look really unappealing to me (especially during the sex scene early on), and so I have never had a thing for her myself. Though, I will say that I've seen more recent images of her online, and she looks a thousand times more attractive in them.

 It's unfortunate that this DVD doesn't have the unrated version of ""Return of the Living Dead 3"", but as it is the only DVD available currently in the U.S., I still suggest fans of the first two films or good horror films in general pick this one up.",1242691200,,5433,4.501519756838905
538037,5,6303047025,"In a California town at a military chemical warfare base, a deadly experiment involving the Trioxen gas from ""Return of the Living Dead 1 & 2"" as it brings the dead back to ghastly life as they crave human brains and Col. Reynolds (Kent McCord) wants to keep them under control. His son Curt (J. Trevor Edmond) and girlfriend Julie (Melinda Clarke) sneek in the base to see what experiments they are conducting and are outstanded. Later when Col. Reynolds and his son goes through a disagreement, Curt runs away with his girlfriend but when a tragic accident on the motorcycle occurs thus leaving Curt alive while Julie dead, he is so grief-struck that he wants her to be alive again. He sneeks into the military base where he uses the gas to bring her back from the dead as it makes him happy, unfortunately what he doesn't realize that the Julie that has comes back isn't herself when she starts to act strange as they both deal with gang members and the army who wants them.

A grisly and terrific sequel to the brilliant 1985 horror-comedy classic ""Return of the Living Dead"" that manages to improve over part 2 by making it a completely different entry. This one is directed by Brian Yuzna of ""Re-Animator"" fame and co-stars Sarah Douglas (""Superman 2"") and playboy playmate Pia Reyes, the story is well-put and crafted that makes this a Romeo-and-Juliet love story, a dark comedy and a zombie movie into one movie. This film is loaded with graphic gore, brain-eating and also some S&M style imagery of self-mutilation with excellent make-up effects by Steve Johnson, the acting isn't too shabby and this movie is a spectacular splatter-fest that makes it a winner in my books.

This DVD contains a great transfer on sound and picture but doesn't offer the uncut version with a few scenes of graphic gore cut out but that's ok and has two audio commentaries with trailers to this and other TriMark releases.

The final 15 or so minutes of this movie really kick, there's not many zombies until the end, but it is definetly watchable and has some good gore scenes.

To me, this movie was one of the movies form the last class of great horror movies from the 80s and early/mid 90's like DEAD ALIVE and such before horror really went in the toilet at the end of the 90's through today (see the 4th and 5th ROTLD movies for proof.... or better yet... don't).",1217980800,,883,4.325301204819277

They try to captivate the story to a level exploring behind the goverments plots/plans to do with frozen incarbonate zombies.. but of course they break out nad it goes hideously wrong! One young lady gets infected, she slowly turns into one...with a sadistic consequences!

The story holds togeather enough to make a 3 star but, what lets this down is it's refusal to be either funny or scary. In the first one the mix was just right, the second wasn't a bad sequel but here its neither here nor there. Myself, i think they could of gone for scares and it could of surpassed the second one, but the acting lets it down and literally those 'are' the funny moments in it. If it had some jokes we would of all laughed along knowing its all supposed to be 'schlocky' unfortunately i think this has become like many are now a franchise.

Anyone who is familiar with Brian Yuzna's bizarre style of filmmaking should be able to appreciate this film. It has the feel that he created in the classic BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR which features a good balance of subte black comedy, outrageous gore scenes, Fangoria centerfold pinup worthy creatures and commentary.

This is my favorite of the ROTHLD series, though I have yet to see parts 4 and 5. The comedy aspect is not quite as obvious as it is in part 1, but it is there and overall this one is more original and entertaining than part 2.",1160265600,2,601,4.555555555555555
538137,3,6303047025,"In 1993 horror fans were greeted with the release of Return of the Living Dead III. This third film in the Return of the Living Dead series produced by John Russo ends up being a very good zombie movie and actually has genuine horror that the second film lacked. What ROTLDIII, its writers and directors seem to have left behind was the comedy side of the series which made them cult-classics to begin with.

Taking up directing duty this time around was genre-veteran Brian Yuzna (Beyond Re-Animator) who films this third film purely on a horror standpoint. This film is serious horror from start to finish. This time around the military is still trying to find a way to use 2-4-5 Trioxin as a way to create zombie soldiers, but ones that could be easily controlled by them. To say that this project hasn't met with success was an understatement. But it's the story of the son of the military project director and his girlfriend who dominate the film's plot. As portrayed by James T. Callahan and Melinda Clarke, these two star-crossed lovers find themselves enmeshed with the dark secret of the project being held in secret. Son soon uses the Trioxin gas to try and ressurect his girlfriend who gets killed early on during an accident. What he gets instead is an undead girlfriend whose hunger for live brains (for some reason the zombies in this ROTLD sequel also feed on other bodily parts) can only be controlled when she causes herself bodily pain through extreme forms of piercing. The rest of the film deals with the father trying to save his son not just from himself and his undead girlfriend but from the hordes of escaped zombies in the facility.

The horror in the film was actually pretty good and this was helped alot by the gore effects work which surpasses anything the first two films in the series had. The acting was decent enough with Melinda Clarke as the zombiefied girlfriend putting on a sexy, albeit creepy performance. If it wasn't for the brain and flesh-eating she sure would've made for quite a poster girl for teenage boys.

In the end, Return of the Living Dead III continues the ROTLD series admirably. Despite not having much humor and comedy in the film, this third film in the series more than makes up for it with high levels of gore and a definite sense of horror the first two didn't much have.",1155600000,21,2333,4.630434782608695

I saw it when I was 15 and was into gory horror films (which it is a very gory movie.) But now that I'm 21, I see that this movie was pretty bad as far as acting and plot goes. Return of the living dead part 3 was made in 1993, so there was a lot of instances where they would try to tye it to pop culture. For example, the main charactor's name is Curt and later on when he's in the sewer with Julie and the homeless man he says wants to go to seattle and start a band. That's a pathatic attempted at trying to be hip. Also self-mutilation was coming up to the surface around that time, and coincidentally Juile can only stop the hunger by hurting herself. Also the ending is predicable. Only see this movie if your into sappy, cheesey love stories and huge amounts of blood and guts.",1145664000,,912,4.016483516483516

 Let me start by saying that this is not your typical zombie movie. There is no grand scale zombie threat as in the classics Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the dead, or even Day of the Dead.

 The story revolves around two lovers. The woman, played by the gorgeous Melinda Clarke, dies and is brought back to life. The movie revolves around her pain and what she does to relieve it.

  Definitely not a movie to watch if you want lots of scares, and although few, the zombies in it are great, including the ""military prototype"" zombie with metal armor attached to it.",1142208000,4,698,4.364341085271318
538141,2,6303047025,"I was way into the return of the living dead series when i rented this. I started off with number 2 (whcih people here seem to hate for some reason), then was blown away when I saw number 1. I rented number 3 with pretty high expectations. I was expecting a zombie holocaust type situation (even if it was only in one town) along with a descent amount of comedy.

It turns out its a love story. *spoiler* the main character accidently kills his girlfriend in a motorcycle accident. guilt stricken he brings her back with the chemical from previous return films he gets out of his daddys lab. When his gf is brought back she struggles between the urge to eat brains and her love for the main character*/spoiler*. Its an interesting take on the zombie genre, with some good gore.

Its huge flaws are that it never seems to end when it should (it would have gotten another start for being shorter) and for trying to be too serious. The whole 'my daddys a military guy who has a secret lab' thing is done pretty cheesily, along with a lot of other things, yet it tries so hard to be serious. I seriously wasn't expecting that from a 'return' film, I expected my 'return' films to be fun and gruesome. Deffinently rent it tho, if for no other reason than to see the chick who plays a bitchy mom on the OC shove glass into her own boob (yeah, you read that right).",1138406400,,1358,4.32156862745098

538202,2,6303047025,"Brian Yuzna is what George Lucas is to the Star Wars prequals. He ""almost"" pulled off Re-Animator in feel, if only it did not come across like a TV Soap Opera.

 He made Society, which I guess was making a social commentary, but without ANY Romero wit, let alone character development, or reason at times.

 He made Re-Animator 3, and packed that with layer upon layer of bad acting, and boring script.

 I dunno, I realy feel that this guy lacks talent, he's like some 10 year old who's only passion is to drool over b-rate latex effects, which I've got to admit are always interesting, and once and a while actually good like Evil Dead good, but the story and characters always suck.

 This movie happens to feature the army who now wants to enhance the zombies, and give them ex-skelotons and the like, and make them into un-stopable war machines. Anyhow, the boy's father works for the army, and he steals his dad's security pass, and sneaks himself and his immature confused goth/pop girly friend, and stumbles upon an experiment with the living dead, eventually he runs away from daddy, wrecks into a pole, kills his chick, revives, her, she becomes sadistic, they go on and adventure in south centeral and battle cheesey 80's stereo typical latino gang members who as usually hang out at 7/11, drinking slurpyies, and playing pac-man whith there whores. And so the movie goes on. The only thing I like about this film is some of the effects, as b-gore is always great, unless ruined by horrible plot, casting, and acting, which is the case here no doubt!

 The bumb is awsome too, infact he is one of the coolest characters to ever grace the horror movie screens!

 If you don't know by now, 4 and 5 are on there way, and they are going to suck! Tobe Hooper was trying to direct them, but instead they hand the crap over to the guy who directed 8 Legged Freaks. I guess they assume that the masses want it to suck like 2 and 3, rather than amaze as part 1 did!?!?

538203,4,6303047025,"This unique sequel finds two teenage-lovers Curt and Julie looking for a thrill, and they find it in a secret Government research lab where Curt's Dad works. There, they learn the chilling factor that the dead can remain living with the help of a chemical called '2-4-5 Trioxin.' Curt horrified, Julie amazed, both flee to Curts house to chill out. When Curts' father returns home they both get in an argument that causes Curt and Julie to escape on Curts' motorcycle. Unfortunately for Julie, there is a motorcycle accident and Julie is killed. Curt, afraid to live without her, revives her with the chemical Trioxin. But Julie isn't the same as she use to be, she feels different and very, very hungry. In a murderous accident Julie soon learns that only the taste of brains will norish her. Curt disgusted at what he sees begins to regret his actions. But then Julie learns that the pain helps, pain makes the hunger go away. With a Mexican gang on thier tails, the teenagers escape and find a new friend called 'River-Man.' As Julies' urges for brains grow stronger, she goes to drastic measures and does some serious decorating on her own body using metal, glass, chains and more to create enough pain to sustain her.

With her urges growing stronger to attack Curt, Julie must under-go a painful transformation, if she ever hopes to leave Curts' brains in his head where they belong.

I really enjoyed this movie, I found it as good as the first and way better then the horrible Part 2. The plot-line had a good speed, it didn't drag nor rush into things. The acting by Curt and Julie is fantastic and 'The new Julie' looks very cool and gross. If you're a gore hound then I highly recommend this movie.

However, when she comes back, she's got a hunger she's never had before, and it's like the old saying goes; a girl's gotta eat.

Part 3 had it's moments, as I sit and write this review I am looking at the movie poster with a heavily pierced Mindy Clarke Staring at me, The Moments it did have were far and few between. This is in my opinion not a worthy sequel to the series do to the ill-fated Romeo And Juliet back Story, Sorry but Zombies and Romance hardly go Hand in Hand. I waited 5 years for this sequel and even drove to Philadelphia to see it on the Big Screen.

Like I said, a smart set up to what could've been a smart zombie movie, but the main problem is in how the girl, who turns into a hungry and ultra piercing freak, and her wusy boyfriend, make what should be a tragic and interesting tale into a lagging semi-comedy with minority characters with details as thin as Jack Skellington and homeless people sprinkled in just to buy time.

Ok part three wasn't as bad as part 2 there were a few good moments. I rember seening this when it came out in 1993 poping it in the vcr seening the military scene thinking this is going to be good and then it fell flat. With only a few more good moments in it keep the testing scene and ending dump the rest the part were the store owner turns is ok but they do not show her feasting on him. And him attacking the cops was ok but besides that it was flat and boring they could have done so much more with this. The story for the orginal was they eat brains to stop there pain but in the ending he gets bit on the arm shows his father the bite and kills himself because he will turn can you say rip off!! I cant belive they would even try and add Romero's mind into this . And the directors twist that she inflects pain on her self so she won't kill is just down right stuiped . It was explaned in the first instaulment that rigamortis was the cause of there pain and hunger to get electrons from the brain and if this one would of fallowed the greeatness of the first she would have killed him in the begining
of the film but the director had to be orginal and mess it up.
I highly doubt there will ever be a forth film i hope there isnt

The F/X are not too brilliant and the characters can be somewhat empty and un-interesting. However Mindy 'The Killer Tongue' Clarke is very, very sexy (for a zombie!) and it had a nice touch with acclaimed horror director Anthony Hickox (Warlock: the armageddon, Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth) making a cameo as a doctor who becomes a zombie (""..Dr. Hickox has been killed!!"").

What he created was a huge success, and almost delivered the best zombie movie of the 90s (that crown has to go to Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD. Oops, sorry US - DEAD/ALIVE).
His sequel is funny, scary and poignant and leaps well ahead the truly abysmal first sequel that Ken Wiederhorn made in the late 80s. I did kinda miss the James Karen and Thom Matthews characters from the first two movies, and felt they would have given this entry a little more general humour - and, possibly linked this one tighter to the first two. However, that is a minor quibble as all-in-all this flick delivers on all accounts. Lead actress Melinda Clarke is great, and it was good to see director Anthony Hickox in a minor zombie role. The disc is good, with yet again (as with FAUST) two commentary tracks about the production, trailers and a sharp transfer of the movie. A nice addition to the zombie sub-genre, not as good as the first RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD movie, but a vast improvement over the second. Yuzna has delivered another quality low budget horror movie with hardcore gore and an engaging script. Its a pity that there aren't many more horror directors like him working today, perhaps the genre wouldn't be so frowned upon if they did . . .",1004313600,3,1508,4.737642585551331

538431,5,6303047025,"Brian Yuzna's ""Return of the Living Dead 3"" is a film whose legend must surely grow-- its searingly intense performances, dark humour,  and unique sensibility promise that it will be remembered.  In many  remarkable ways, this film is a superior companion-piece to Neil Jordan's  adaptation of ""Interview With the Vampire""; it achieves marvels  of imaginative authority denied to that big-budget effort (despite its many  charms).  Yuzna achieves a kind of Ridley Scott look on a small budget--  and his camera angles and movements become more uncannily effective with  each viewing, as with the magnificent shot that follows the cadaver into  the lab in the first horror-scene of the film.  But surpassing the  intensity of the zombie-attacks is the existential crisis of Julie, our  revivified heroine who can only maintain mental control through a  masochistic descent into compulsive body-modification.  The central  relationship, with its Romantic sense of unavoidable doom, makes this film  a kind of (serious!) zombie ""Tristan und Isolde.""  It goes  without saying that the film delivers horrifically on the decadent  possibilities of Julie's masochistic urges, and the tug between  ""Wuthering Heights""-style love and utter disgust is incredibly  compelling.  And what a climax!  This is a haunting, masterful work-- an  art film that (like any other great horror film) is a grand philosophical  statement.",966211200,7,1413,5.485981308411215

Definitely it's one the best !The story was masterfully told and shown. Part one is excellent. Part two is good,but  this part three is among the best in horror history! Regardless of what  narrow-minded /envious critics ,fake horror fans or would-be highbrow  watchers say,it's wonderful. We all fear death and this is what it is  about! It's about young people (a boyfriend and a kooky pretty  girlfriend)who discover that death is not the final frontier, but a kind of  unconscious state,from which escape is impossible because when resurrected  /brought back to life and to the real world these people gradually lose  what they had and can't be human anymore. They lose their sanity and their  human side and become what we fear most : becoming  barbaric,wild,uncontrollable animals. After paying an illegal visit to a  military facility ,a youth  and his girlfriend (MINDY CLARKE)discover that  the army has been doing experiments with the dead! That's how the story  starts! Mindy does an excellent job(always!) as  a zombie girl full of  love,compassion and conscience,a girl who knows what she has become and  what she'll have to do sooner or later - kill. She changes from a  sweet,lovely slaphappy teen to a frightening, scaring and scared zombie  with conscience! This is what the movie is about!

""  First things first, the first one of these movies is a cult fave of  mine, a textbook example of how to take old source material and refreshen  it rather than rehash it (The second one is just the opposite, despite  having the girl who does Bart Simpson's voice in it). But 3 turned out to  up the ante of its predecessors. Melinda Clarke does an uncanny job of  portraying the subtext of this movie, that zombie-ism is a metaphor for  Borderline Personality Disorder (the inability to have close relationships,  a perverse compulsion to self mutilate because it's the only way to FEEL  anything, and a tendency towards sucking others into their angst). As the  zombie-fication of Julie worsens, she stabs and mutilates herself to avoid  consuming the only one who cares about her, her boyfriend.

538435,2,6303047025,"""Return of the Living Dead 2"" remains one of my favourite horror comedies. It's a rare treat when a movie manages to spoof its genre and itself while keeping the characters believable and the story from degrading  into just an excuse for gags.
I knew that ""Return of the Living Dead  3"" was a more ""serious"" zombie flick, and I thought it might  be an interesting twist on this series--RoLD1 was semi-serious, RoLD2 was  over-the-top comedy, and RoLD3 sounded like it was going to get back to  basics. It's too bad the writers and directors of this film mistook  ""serious"" for ""flat and uninspired.""
""Return of  the Living Dead 3"" could have been a twisted version of ""Romeo  and Juliet,"" in addition to a creepy zombie flick, but it fails to be  either of those. The film has most the hallmarks of the previous flicks,  but virtually none of the flaire. There is a sense that most of the cast  are just going through motions. The acting is mostly weak, the characters  are mostly uninteresting, the story is painfully predicatable, and all of  these add up to a movie that most viewers simply would be bored watching.  (I know I was!)
There are two things that are worthwhile in this film:  The make-up work is quite nice in most cases, and Melinda Clarke's  performance as a reluctant brain-eater is the only decent acting job in the  film. Her performance is moving at times and humourous at others. Clarke  gets a star all by herself.
RoLD3 *could* have been a chilling and even  at times touching (something rare in any sort of film featuring  cannibalistic zombies!) film, but instead it's just another fifth-rate B  movie for the scrap pile, despite Melinda Clarke's stand-out performance.",950572800,,1696,4.720136518771331
