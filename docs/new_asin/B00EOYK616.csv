5931975,3,B00EOYK616,"Tina Russell was the star of the show. She's the only reason to buy this DVD. She starts off in a nice, slow striptease scene. And The Oral Generation saved the best for last in the final scene with a threesome featuring Russell. Good build-up; nice music, the cameras focused on Russell for much of the scene.

The negatives are the constant sex-ed tutorials in between scenes throughout The Oral Generation. The six-minute narrative citing studies to show that pornography can have a beneficial effect on society was annoying. Since adult films was in its beginning period during this time, and men were beginning to view these films, I think it was a way for the filmmakers to say that watching these movies is perfectly normal human behavior, attempting to ease their audiences conscience, especially if they cite reputable studies such as Masters & Johnson, The Catholic Church easing up their dogmatic opposition to various forms of sexual practices, and the presidential commission's findings on pornography.

There are several shorts before the main feature: Clinical Sex, Any Way You Like It, Naked Sexes, The Different Sexes, Oral Gen Outtake. Many of the shorts were soft-core. Any Way You Like It was a let down. The main character of the feature, Mrs. Wilson, had this Mrs. Robinson quality about her but just when the scene between her and her therapist is about to heat up, it cuts to the end. Naked Sexes was set in a carnivalesque atmosphere and it features women and muscle men in a constant state of euphoric laughter, laughing alongside a laugh track for several minutes for no reason.

Vinegar Syndrome did an outstanding job digitally remastering these films. For movies which were made in 1970 the picture reception was surprisingly clear, and good sound quality, too.",1408579200,27,1791,4.963333333333333
5931976,3,B00EOYK616,"One reviewer Wrote this at the end of his review ""While this might not be the most 'arousing' bit of porn in one's collection - it certainly is 'amusing'!"" EXACTLY!!! WTH is porn for? not to be amusing. I bought this and too many distracting scene jumping going on. Not exactly what I was looking for. There are many other good movies out there from this era. I give it 3 stars only because there are some good looking girls really trying to please in the main attraction. I think the 4 short films are r rated mock sex scenes I could do without.",1406678400,15,546,4.259615384615385

5931978,4,B00EOYK616,"This offering from the Vinegar Syndrome DVD authoring gang takes a slightly different approach from the 'double feature drive-in classics' disks that they have been producing in presenting their trademark retro-period sleeze.  ""The Oral Generation"" package is constructed to give a sense of the experience of attending a typical 'grindhouse' film showing back in the 1970's and features 'trailers' and 4 'short subjects', as well as, the 'feature presentation' of the titular film.  The total run-time for the entire package is approx 2 hrs - with about 50% of the time devoted to the 'shorts''.

Much of the enjoyment of this collection of period sex oddities is related to their 'quaint' approach to sexual matters when viewed from our modern perspective.  Most of the flix provided still exhibit the tendency to wrap all the carnal action in some sort of pseudo-scientific/sociological foolishness to provide the 'redeeming social relevancy' factor that was considered necessary to protect the distributor from being busted for 'pornography'.  The 4 short subjects all appear to have been produced by an outfit called ""Extraordinary Pictures"" and they are all truly 'extraordinary' in their bizarre approach to providing prurient thrills to the porn hounds of yore.  If anything - this little collection graphically demonstrates just how far we've come in the world of sex cinema and what is considered 'acceptable' for adult viewing.  While displaying a fair amount of attractive 'natural' female flesh and love-making, all of these little vignettes steer way clear of anything that would be considered 'hard core XXX' and are more amusing for their lameness factor than for anything arousing.

With the 'main attraction' of ""The Oral Generation"", however, the true XXX factor finally kicks in.  Again, framed as a 'scholarly dissertation' of sorts on the evolving sexual liberation of the 60's & 70's, and particularly on the purported releasing of the 'modern' female libido to empower women to  'do anything' required to 'please their man' - the film focuses primarily on (you guessed it!) oral sex.  Sandwiched between a lot of archival shots of movie theater marquees and adult book stores in NYC there are a series of scenes of attractive couples having sex - or attempting to!  It is one of the more 'entertaining' aspects of this 'expose' on oral sex that, despite the best efforts of the liberated ladies involved, the majority of the guys put in a pretty limp showing.  Perhaps the most 'embarrassing' such segment features a little inter-racial action where an afro-sporting 'bro' is being mightily serviced by a cute blond while he 'fantasizes' about performing macho martial arts moves in distinct contrast to the enthusiasm displayed by his masculine member.  The attractive 'cover girl' on the DVD box cover (Tina Russell) features in the film as a 'fantasy girl' for another guy - as he is getting blown by his actual GF! - Tina does a nasty strip act that leaves little to the imagination.  Beyond an 'out-take' from ""O.G"" that features a cute redhead & her BF 'doing it' - there is virtually no penetration action pictured in any of the films presented - the 'title' says it all - and 'all' is fully shown!

In the final analysis I enjoyed this compilation mostly for its' retro-vibe and the reminder of how far the world of sinema has come since the early days of the 'sexual revolution'.  Props to the many lovely ladies featured who did their best to get the guys goin' - but it sure makes you appreciate how the porn revolution has markedly increased the skill and enthusiasm levels for today's 'oral generation'!  Per usual for Vinegar Syndrome releases - the visual quality of the (full-screen) collection of  movie transfers is outstanding. While this might not be the most 'arousing' bit of porn in one's collection - it certainly is 'amusing'!",1384560000,77,3874,5.043887147335423

5931981,4,B00EOYK616,"The first few minutes of the 'feature' were filmed in Times Square of NYC in 1970 and it's fascinating to compare the sleazy nature of it then with the way it is now.  And what better than to experience a complete porno cinema show that would have been showing in those days?  The short films are quite fun, they feature nudity but simulated sex. One of them is silly and irritating.
The feature is explicit mainstream hardcore.
