7945261,3,B00005MEUS,"This series is great unfortunately Amazon seem to ship the last disk in the series with a major flaw, the last two episodes never play on any DVD player.  I have obtained three of ""End Game"" disks which have the exact same problem yet customer service at Amazon keeps saying its my player for all 3 different disks, even though I have tried them on as many as 10 different compatible DVD players.  It's a shame as everything else I have ever gotten from Amazon is excellent including the rest of this Martion Successor DVD series.  It's a shame that they are unwilling to check the disks they ship for quality as this batch is clearly defunct.  I give the series 5 stars but Amazon in regards to this matter 0 stars.",1124496000,,716,4.401515151515151
7945262,4,B00005MEUS,"What amazes me with this show is very high continuity in quality and story. Despite an admittedly weak story and a precept of spoofing nearly every genre of Anime, it manages it all believably and never descends in the sort of silliness some satire-shows present.
I enjoyed the story (even if some plot twists aren't exactly of shakespearean quality) and the fun.
As I said, the quality is very high; I noticed only one or two scenes (mostly the attack on the Satsuki Midori 2 outpost, where the mecha designs are VERY basic) where it lapses.
Really, I can recommend this series to anyone who enjoys action, comedy and a bit of romance.

7945264,4,B00005MEUS,"While I enjoyed the beginning and middle of this series like Evangelion, I was disappointed at the open ended final episode where there are still questions that were left unanswered. Also, this dvd is pretty much barebones as all you get are the episodes with no significant extras like phot galleries, character profiles, etc. Still, its a nice anime series although I wished there were more series with a definite finality to the last episodes.",1000944000,,446,4.96
7945265,5,B00005MEUS,"`Endgame'... containing the final 5 episodes of the series, from a festival honoring the Jovians with a Gekiganger convention to the outcome of the Earth-Jovian war.  There's plenty of drama, comedy, action and some romance that makes `Martian Successor Nsadesico' work. I'll miss it...",998438400,,286,5.5
