2553580,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yu Yu Hakusho is a fantastic anime and one of my favorites.  If you love Dragon Ball, Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece and you haven't checked this anime out you should since you will love it!

However, there really wasn't a need to release the episodes again (this is the 3rd time now).

Sure the original saga boxsets were ungodly expensive, but that was made up for when they released the 14 episode boxsets (8 in total) for about $22 on the web.  And of course I should mention they just released the 8th one like 2 or 3 months ago.  So this release is quite quick.  If you've already been collecting those you might as well finish since it'd be cheaper and you'll get all the same great episodes, but if you haven't started collecting yet then this is the way to go since its now cheaper.  If I had known they were going to release 28 episodes for $23 then I would have waited, but this is quite sudden.  Instead I paid $23 on 14 episodes, but since my collection is complete I can't complain.  I have the whole series, so there is no need to start buying these boxsets.

Anyway, GREAT ANIME SERIES!!",1212364800,4,1102,4.305825242718447
2553581,5,B000F6ZIFQ,This is easily one of the best anime's of all time if not the best.  I highly you recomend watching this show especially if you enjoy shows like DBZ or Bleach.  The first season takes a while to get good but it does and when it does you'll be hooked for days.  The only negative I have to say is that since this is such a good show I had to buy the giant box sets and now they come out with such a nice re-make I'm a little hessitant on buying it.,1211328000,,447,3.78494623655914
2553582,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"Life is hard, and then you die. If you're unlucky, like Yusuke Urameshi, then life gets harder AFTER you die.

In fact, death is only the beginning of his troubles in the first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho."" While this action-comedy series lags during the first few episodes (seriously, a whole episode about Kuwabara's schoolwork?), it picks up considerably once the eclectic main characters are introduced, and Yusuke starts spending his time working as a spirit detective.

Despite a reputation as a hardened rebel, Yusuke was killed knocking a toddler from the path of a moving car. Turns out the afterlife, aka Spirit World, didn't expect such a selfless act -- so Spirit World's toddler ruler Koenma offers him a second chance at life, with the help of the sprightly Botan. After seeing how the people around him are responding to his death -- including his rival Kuwabara and semi-girlfriend Keiko -- Yusuke agrees.

But that's a lot easier said than done, and only another selfless act keeps Yusuke from being permanently dead. And his return is conditional -- now he's working for Koenma as Spirit Detective. And his first case is a doozy -- retrieve three stolen artifacts from a demon trio, including the ruthless Hiei and mysterious Kurama. But Yusuke soon finds that Kurama's motives are a lot more complicated than he thought -- and that Hiei has a very nasty fate in mind for Keiko.

On Koenma's orders Yusuke signs up for an aging martial-artist's Pick-A-Student competition, to hunt down a lethal demon -- and his psychic rival Kuwabara may be in danger. And when rage-inducing insects start swarming his town, Yusuke and Kuwabara are sent to stop the malevolent demon band responsible for it. What's more they have some reluctant new allies -- the paroled Hiei and Kurama.

But Yusuke receives an even more sensitive assignment after that -- rescue a beautiful ice maiden from a human crimelord. To complicate matters, Kuwabara has fallen in love with her, and she's also Hiei's twin sister. But as the boys fight their way into the fortified mansion, they can't even imagine the danger that is guarding the ice maiden... and just slavering for a fight with them.

The first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is all about introducing the characters, and easing Yusuke into his new role as Spirit Detective. It starts off rather slowly, with a string of episodes all about Yusuke floating around yelling at people, occasionally possessing Kuwabara and helping the big friendly lug with his homework. It's a rather bland start to an action-series.

But things start picking up when Yusuke is made Spirit Detective. Then we're treated to grotesque demonic opponents, superpowers, nasty spells, and lots of action-packed sequences involving fists, lightning, lava, swords and rose vines. And the villains get way worse with each successive battle, right up to the explosive fight at the end of the first season.

It's not all action, though. There's some romantic stuff between the bickering Yusuke and Keiko, as well as Kuwabara's adorable crush on Hiei's sister. And there's a pretty hefty dose of humor as well -- the pacifier-sucking Koenma and his overworked office ogres, Kuwabara's kitten, or Genkai's torturous training. Funny dialogue too (""We're just watching fuzz."" ""Fuzz, yes fuzz! We find it relaxing"").

Yusuke makes a solid anti-hero, with his alcoholic mother and a mile-wide rebellious streak. While he's a bit obnoxious at first, his increasing strength and responsibility make him more likable. And his thuggish-looking classmate Kuwabara makes an unexpected ally, since he turns out to be a lot more powerful and sweet-natured than you'd expect.

The crabby, lethal Hiei is still something of an enigma here, but Kurama more than makes up for that -- he's graceful, elegant, and has a very peculiar past as a foxy thief with a rose whip. We've also got a number of interesting supporting characters, such as Botan the perky Grim Reaper, Genkai the crusty martial-artist, and the feisty Keiko who proves to be Yusuke's only weak spot.

The first season of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" is there to warm up the storyline, and introduce the main characters. While the beginning is a bit slow, it's a solid beginning to a good anime.",1211328000,17,4237,4.978783592644978
2553583,4,B000F6ZIFQ,The Yu Yu Hakusho DVDs are pretty expensive and many of the BIG box sets have been discontinued. I was so happy to see that the 1st season box set is being re-released in this affordable and more compact design. I was actually ready to buy the big old box sets from sellers on the site or from eBay but that idea has gone out the window. I haven't seen the whole series only a few of the 1st episodes of season 1 and i generally liked the series and would like to finish it and see what happens. I'm a huge fan of anime that has been animated in the 1990's. They all have a quality all their own with colors that just aren't visible in current new titles. Everything seems so computerized lately that certain artistic qualities just doesn't exist anymore. I can't wait for this release and hope they release all the other seasons as well in due time. Of course in a timely fashion and not a new season once every year.,1210118400,23,918,4.221590909090909

Matter of fact, it is perhaps the first official favorite. Has been ever since I kept up with, as best as I could, on the Cartoon Network block, Toonami. Now, I can catch everything I missed when I couldn't keep up on Toonami. I had the biggest crush on Botan, the Grim Reaper figure. And I often felt bad for her when Yusuke, the main character, would smack her in the head again and again. I still do feel bad, though I can understand that she comes off as annoying. I was also surprised to find out that Kazuma Kuwabara actually joined the team for a reason. Once the season ended, I wanted to get season 2 and see what becomes of our heroes in the Dark Tournament.

2553598,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"I have had the entire series for a couple years now.  I've seen it all the way through several times.

Of the anime series that became well known in America (via Toonami and Adult Swim atleast) this is one of my favorites.  It never really gets slow or repetitive.  Despite effectively maintaining its focus on the action and major events in between it never becomes gratuitous.  It isn't quite Dragonball or Dragonball Z in terms of pace or duration, but might be a close cousin.  The styling is a mixture that never reaches Samurai Champloo or higher.  It has shameless angst, but never becomes nauseating.  Most of the humor, especially the student-teacher jokes keep the episodes enjoyable.  If you're looking for an anti-hero fix or a break from Mr. Guaranteed Victory, this might be it.",1488326400,,792,4.807407407407408

To say I actually prefer the English dub over the Japanese is unheard of with my love for Anime, but a handful of animes, including YYH most certainly flips that switch and I can't listen to it in anything other than the English dub, as the voice casting is not only iconic, but perfect!
A must buy, if you love this series as much as I do and for the price, it's a steal! I can't tell you how many times I've had to not buy or buy slowly a anime series due to the ridiculous pricing set for one volume/season, that doesn't have many episodes on it.

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) Yusuke Urameshi a 14 year old boy in jr high was skipping class once again. Everyone in the town knew him as a delinquent. He was also known for fighting with other students from other schools for no reason but just to show them he was the #1 fighter in the town. One day as he is walking he sees a young boy's ball roll into the street, suddenly a car comes flying around the corner and is going to hit the boy. Yusuke jumps infront and grabs the boy and gets hit by the car, saving the boys life. He gets up and starts calling to people for help but the people only seem to ignor Yusuke and only care about the boy and not him. Getting angry at everyone ignoring him he takes a punch at a guy and his punch goes right threw him. Yusuke realises hes dead and he is now a ghost. While he starts flying in the air he is met by a grim reaper aka shinigami named Boton (pronounced Bow-t-On) who tells him he is not fated to die this day and that the spirit world has given him a job to be the new spirit detective. Not wanting to do it he starts flying off because he knows no one cares for him. Boton shows him the three only people who care for him. His mother Atsuko, His childhood friend and sometimes sweet heart Keiko, and Kuwabara the second toughest fighter and Yusuke frienemy (more of a friend then enemy). Once desiding to take the job Yusuke is met by the Koenma jr the so called manager of spirit world. He gives Yuskue his first every case file and the adventure goes on!

Pros: The storyline is great! The characters have great back stories and you feel like you can really connect with them. The action is first rate, tons of punching, kicking and spirit tools uses to defeat villians. This verson of the show is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED, so you will get all the blood, sex refferences and the swearing they use in the show, (not too much swearing, worse they say is b*tch, A-hole, Sh*t and bastard).

Cons: Personally for me what I didn't like was the box caseing the dvds came in, they were and feel kinda flimsy and cheap.

Story con: what I found was kind of misleading was Yusukes job title ""Spirit Detective"". Yes he has cases but its not really a whole solve the mystery kind of show. He never ask questions to victims or anything, the case files are more like ""This guy(s) is causing trouble, go beat him up and stop him before he gets to earth realm and causes trouble for the humans"".

Episodes: this box comes with episodes 1 to 28. This contains all the spirit detective story arc and the very begining of the Dark Tournament arc.

Episodes and seasons crossover: this is just saying how episode 26, 27, and 28 are really season 2 episodes, even tho its in season 1, season 1 stops at episode 25 and season 2 starts at episode 26

Over all: I loved this show! its really good, It is amazing, if you love this season then season 2 aka the Dark Tournament you will be even more in love with it! I personally call this one of the best anime's ever!!! BUY THIS SHOW!!!!!",1454630400,2,3106,4.272108843537415

2553655,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"This show is a masterpiece. It's got gritty 90s anime action, some stellar voice acting for its time, and it looks really good visually as well. Warning tho, it's got some heavy emotional moments in it tho. I would definitely recommend only 14 - 16 and up to watch this. It can be uber violent sometimes. And there's some disturbing images in it too. It's not a major gore fest at all (especially compared to some other 80s & 90s anime) it's just it can be disturbing for younger audiences. I love this show tho. I grew up on Yu Yu Hakusho alongside with DBZ. Anyone that's ever watched this show on Toonami (when it CN was still good) can attest to how awesome this show was and still is. These dvd seasons are better tho because it's completely uncensored and unedited. Hence why I said what I said earlier up top. But anyway, soon as you start watching you'll be glued to your screen. That's just how intriguing this series is. By time you finish this series, you'll wonder why they didn't at least make a couple more seasons or a 2nd generation. Better yet, they could've made like a prequel mini series like before Yusuke, like either a few generations back, or all the way back to his **SPOILER ALERT** other than human roots. The way they made it, they easily could've gone those routes. Who knows... the original creators probably already did in the comics.

2553672,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"I've been a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho since it first aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami back in the early 2000's. This classic and awesome Shonen style anime is based off the manga of the same name. In the story of Yu Yu Hakusho is about young man named Yusuke Urameshi who gains the ability to control his spirit energy which he uses to fight powerful demons and enemies. With his new gain powers he becomes a Spirit Detective for the Spirit World, where he is assigned missions from retrieving missing objects to defeating powerful foes who threaten the Human world and Spirit World. On these missions he meets new friends like Botan, Kuwabara, Kurama and Hiei to help him succeed. This anime is a little dated but its a fantastic classic anime just like Dragon Ball z that shouldn't be passed up. In this volume includes the first 28 episodes labelled as ""Season 1"" in both with Japanese and English (dubbed by Funimation) language audio options. The Yu Yu Hakusho: Season 1 is an awesome anime and series to own and especially if you're into collecting Anime. This series is worth adding to your collection.

2553674,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yusuke Urameshi is a teenage boy with some issues. He hates school, hates authority, but loves to fight. During one of his strolls he's killed by a car saving a young boys life. His spirit leaves his body and he's encountered by a girl on a flying broom named Boltan, whom reveals to him that it wasn't his time to go and if he wants to return to his body he must overcome one ordeal. Who exactly is this girl, and why is Yusuke given this second chance? -summary

 Yu Yu Hakusho was a direct challenge to Dragonball Z, and although it would fail to become as popular or successful, for me, it was still the better show and is probably the best of all the DBZ clones out there. Now make no mistake, this is far from high art and ranks low in terms of quality anime. However, it knows exactly what it wants to be and it never strives to be anything more than low brow entertainment. Although I'm not exactly a fan of these types of anime titles, I would be lying if I said they never hooked me, and Yu Yu definitely managed to hook me to the point where I can actually marathon it. Sometimes we need to give the brain a break from the more intellectually taxing anime.

 The story follows Yusuke as he soon becomes forced to work as a Spirit Detective for the Spirit World. He's given missions where he would have to kill or capture wanted demon criminals. He's given the ability to harness his inner spirit to unleash a very powerful attack through his finger called the ""Spirit Gun"", which in the beginning is an attack he can only use once a day. Along the way he would battle other demons that soon become his allies in battle against tougher threats.

 The first few episodes are spent developing Yusuke through some interesting stories, and other faces are introduced. Things become more interesting when Yusuke has to compete in a small martial arts tournament hosted by an old fighter named Genkai, with his mission to win the tournament and learn her special technique, keeping a centuries old warrior named Rando from learning it and using it for evil intentions. This is a decent battle and as usual with these types of anime series, a newer and stronger threat will always arise to provide an even greater challenge.

 Yu Yu Hakusho is one of those titles you can just dive into and start having a good time if you fall for the characters early. The characters are indeed interesting, as they don't follow the molding of the traditional shonen heroes. These guys are anti-heroes from top to bottom. Yusuke can some times care less if the world is facing annihilation in some form, as long as he can enjoy his three day weekend. And the series becomes more interesting when the characters Kurama and Hiei are added to the line up. I think these two overshadow the rest of the characters because their personalities are so much different, with Kurama being the calmest, yet possessing a merciless streak where he can kill anyone, and Hiei, recommending to wipe out all competition if it suits the mission.

 The show has plenty of fun moments, but it also has its share of dull ones too. These long series are usually long because of the unnecessary padding, and this series has a great deal of that which becomes a little worse later on. There are just too many moments that drag for no good reason, from meaningless dialog to just plain fooling around. It can sometimes be funny but also annoying too.

 These type of titles should excel during the animation, and Yu Yu succeeds in that at times. Some of the action scenes are pretty cool and brutal, yet they also utilize the quick, re-used cel format to simulate action. I know many people find great entertainment in that, but it really doesn't appeal to me. The show does make up for it with some of the more violent scenes. Overall, the animation does appear dated yet thankfully it does get better later on. The voice acting for the dub is a lot more enjoyable to me mainly because of the dialog. The only downside would be the voice work for Kuwabara played by Christoper R. Sabat, which goes far beyond the realm of annoying as his character is heavily forced into being the comic relief. My finger is usually itching for that mute button when he's on screen, which is unfortunate since I enjoy Sabat as a voice actor. The BGM, if anything, compliments the action and comedy well enough, with the only stand out to me being the upbeat, dance influenced ending theme.

 This first season collects the first 28 episodes out of 112, with the very last two actually being part of season 2 which leads into the Dark Tournament Saga. In closing, Yu Yu Hakusho is not for the anime fan who must consistently sit through the thought provoking or overly dark titles. If you enjoyed Dragon Ball Z or Bleach, then there's a real good chance you'll like this too.

Pros: Easy to get into, light entertainment

Cons: Drags at times, animation is ok at best",1413590400,,4912,4.520856820744081
2553675,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yu Yu Hakusho was one of the first anime series I ever really got into, so it's always had a special place in my heart. The characters are somewhat ""stock"" (you've got a badass main character who secretly hides a heart of gold, a goofy rival/best friend, the deadly little dude, and a somewhat feminine but composed and intelligent character to help round it out), but invested with enough unique individuality that they don't feel like the cardboard cut-outs of a Dragonball Z template you occasionally see in these fighting anime.
I'll assume you've read the product description and so won't delve into the story details, but suffice it that this is an action packed story with supernatural elements, lots of fighting and unique arenas/vistas, and surprisingly clever writing. The first season entry starts out fairly light-hearted despite opening with the main character's apparent death, and manages to combine an appealing kind of bubbly optimism with dark humor.

The collection itself is a great investment for the price, with four discs in two cases, all within a slim cardboard box. The narrowness of the box itself makes it somewhat prone to squishing around the corners, but on a shelf with other dvds or blu-rays it should last for a good, long time.",1413331200,,1262,4.952830188679245

2553686,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"I've always loved Yu Yu Hakusho ever since I was in middle school. It was created before I was born but it is one of my first shounen and one of the only ones that has stayed with me for many years. It is a anime classic, and if you don't mind the length of the series I would hope you enjoy this series as much as I have.

It's a fun, kick ass adventure that has a lot of messages instilled in it's episodes. And the battle scenes are fantastic and grip you with the sounds of breaking bones. The characters are fun to watch and I never got tired of watching Yusuke as our fun, daring, silly, hot headed protagonist. The animation is dated but gets better and better as you continue to watch. And the opening song may seem out of place at first but you'll probably end up getting it stuck in your head anyways.

It's definitely worth the chance, try and finish disk one before you make quick judgement. Because the adventures and challenges only get more and more crazy, exciting and intense. Yu Yu Hakusho is a show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Though the series is long the time flies with each episode.

It's an experience, that I'm glad to have had. It's definitely something I'm glad to own, and have on my shelf.

Funimation didn't release the best made case in the world but the price is undeniable. I did not feel like I over paid in any way. I think I got my money's worth of this item.

Regarding this particular seller:

Great service. I have no complaints. I ordered Two Day Shipping and got it earlier than the estimated time. I bought it new and it was in good condition. I was surprised at how many episodes it had on each of the 4 discs. Very pleased.",1405123200,,1680,4.218068535825545

One should say ""discs 1-2"" and the other ""discs 3-4"" they're neat because they each have their own artwork relating the respective season. Mine came with two ""disc 3-4"" cases.

I caught this show when it premiered on the anime block of Adult Swim over a decade ago. This series follows the exploits of a boy named Yuske Urameshi, a misanthropic juvenile delinquent. Our protagonist loves to fight, swear, skip school, and disrespect any authority he can, but that all changes when he dies. He is informed that he must undergo trials to get his life back. Afterwards, the plot centers around his new adventures as a ""spirit detective"".

The characters were unlike anything I had seen at the time, after the first four or so episodes the pacing hits a break neck speed, and the plot is generally interesting at all time. Couple that with beautiful and intriguing set pieces, atmosphere, and tone and you have a recipe for greatness. You get 600 minutes (spread over 28 episodes) of great action, mystery, and comedy which is pretty impressive.

This was the precursor to ""Bleach"" and the refinement of DBZ, so if either of those shows or the genre appeals to you, you can't go wrong with this. That said, the show can be a bit juvenile and it has begun to show its age. Still, I love this show and season one definitely stands out as the best to me. If you can get past the first four ok (but not amazing) episodes you're in for a great ride.",1363046400,,1280,4.512931034482759

2553751,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"As a recent Anime Buff I have been purchasing show after show attempting to compile a vast collection of shows. I had seen advertisements for this show when I was younger but never watched it. Having now watched the first season I can say this is an excellent choice for anyone who enjoys anime. This show incorporates aspects of justice, action, and emotion. The justice aspect is present in most anime, this one turning a bad boy into a stand up character. The action in this show is comparable to other anime shows with spans of dialogue with some action dispersed. However, there were entire episodes where they battled and it got very intense. Finally, the emotion was very unique to me. It drew you in almost immediately with feelings that other anime yield from their final episodes. For any Bleach fan, the time when Ichigo uses his Final Getsuga and realizes he will lose his soul reaper powers created a feeling of disappointment and a realization of the end. Yu Yu Hakusho creates a comparable feeling within the first 5 episodes. It is truly an adventure to behold.",1357344000,,1077,4.703703703703703

She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time.

But I will say this, For those who seen the post about this show being the greatest anime, well I must say that is far from the truth. I would say this rather than fairy tale and soul eater, this show actually has more emotion than your average anime which in my opinion is necessary for a anime show to be great.

There is a Yu Yu Hakusho movie out, do not buy it. All of the voices are completely, I mean completely different. If that doesnt bother you than go for it, but my opinion is to stay away.

You could choose between Japanese or English audio and to my surprise it didn't stop there you could also choose from the original Japanese text intro and song or the English intro and song. (The difference is the intro credits in eng vs jap) The one thing that turned me off on all four of the season sets was how small they were. They shoved 2 small dvd cases into a small paper box set and put 2 dvds per case. It was just too small and seems to easy to destroy  but the over all series is great.,1295568000,,715,4.143884892086331
2553772,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic series of which I've been a fan of since I was a little girl, and it is a long series at that. So, I was ecstatic to find the complete series. I won't review the series here (there's a wiki page for it and plenty of online reviews for the show itself), just the box set.

Packaging:
Overall, I would have preferred a single box set, but considering the series length, the four sets take up very little shelf space. Each season is two thinpaks (each containing two discs) in a slim, thin box. Honestly, I wish the box covers were a bit thicker and sturdier, these will tear and show wear quite easily I'm afraid. Each season has a different character theme for the box and thinpaks: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei. The dvd menus also have character themes. Every inch of the box sets are covered in nice art, from beautiful line art on the inside of the thinpaks to colorful group artwork on the covers.  The only undecorated space is the dvd's themselves, which are white with minor detail, but it's a nice bit of symmetry and simplicity to contrast the rest of the detailed and colorful packaging.

Dvd's:
The dvd's themselves are fairly simple; the sound and picture quality is excellent in both English and Japanese, and there are two sets of English subtitles -one that matches the English dub and one that is a direct translation of the Japanese. Both are in small, white unobtrusive font which is nice in that they don't clutter up the screen but is harder to read on smaller screens. The special features are sadly nothing special; usually just trailers for other anime or one-paragraph character profiles. The main menu has no fancy video intro but it does have a really awesome rock-theme that plays in the background. Still, it would have been nice to have different music for different menus, as YYH sports a varied and catchy arsenal of themes.

Another nitpick is the weird cutting off points for the seasons - the Dark Tournament Arc starts in box-set one and ends in box-set three, and considering the number of Dark Tournament Arc episodes on box-sets one and three it would have been easy to fit them on the dvd's for box-set two, or add one more thinpak. I would not have minded even a slimmer (and by extension cheaper) fourth and final box set (The Three Kings Arc is under twenty episodes) if it meant each box-set would truly only contain one season each. This is a minor, organizational complaint, though. It only really becomes an annoyance if you were to go looking for a particular episode to re-watch and it turned out to not be in the box-set you expected because it was tacked on to the beginning of the box-set after or the ending of the box-set before.

In conclusion, it's a great value for the money simply due to the series size, and everything is done well, but it would have been nice to see the distributors go the extra mile and splurge on thicker packaging and better special features. I'm satisfied with these four box sets but if a more complete single box set comes out I'll be the first to sell these and buy that. If you are already a fan of the series I recommend picking these up, but if you just want to test it out I'd recommend you find another way to watch a few episodes (funimation sometimes offers free streaming of their anime on their website) and see if you genuinely like it before you lay your cash down, as these won't have great resale value if it turns out it's not your thing.

A satisfactory job, but not an exceptional one. 3.5/5 stars, which for convenience I'll round up.

EDIT: Also, be careful when putting the dvd's back in to secure them firmly.  They tend to fall out of their places a lot easier than other thinpaks I have had, my season 2 box-set in fact had one loose dvd. Not deal-breaking, you just have to make sure they are secure instead of just throwing them in all willy nilly.",1284508800,2,3889,4.483050847457627
2553773,3,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yu Yu Hakusho: The Complete First Season is a four-disc DVD set that contains twenty-eight episodes.  However, the title is a little misleading.  The set actually contains the entire first season, as well as three episodes from the second season.  The first disc contains eight episodes, the second disc contains six episodes, the third disc contains eight episodes, and the fourth disc contains six episodes.  It should be noted that on the DVD boxes, the English episode titles are used; however, on the actual discs, the original Japanese titles are used in the episodes.

On the first disc, the only ""extra"" is a link that takes you to a menu for trailers.  The trailers available to view on this disc are for the FUNimation Channel, Dragon Ball Z, Case Closed, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Samurai 7.

The second disc has three extras.  The first consists of character profiles, which are a single page for each character with an accompanying picture.  On this disc, there are profiles for Yusuke, Kuwabara, Botan, Keiko (misspelled as Kayko), Koenma, Atsuko, Hiei, Kurama, Gouki, Genkai, Kazemaru, Kibano, Shorin/Rando, and Ogre.  Textless Songs has both the opening and closing credits, which are available in both Japanese and English.  For the Japanese version, you still see the subtitles for the lyrics on the screen.  There are also trailers for Desert Punk, The Galaxy Railways, Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball GT, and the Z-Store.

The only ""extra"" on the third disc are trailers.  The trailers on this disc are for the FUNimation Channel, Case Closed, Dragon Ball Z, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki.

The fourth disc has three extras.  The first is more character profiles, done in the exact same style as the profiles on disc two.  On this disc are profiles for Genbu, Seiryu, Byakko, Suzaku, The Toguros, The Triad, Sakyo, Tarukane, Yukina, Yusuke, Kuwabara, Koenma, Gondawara, Rinku, Koto, and Shizuru.  The textless songs that appear on this disc are exactly the same as what appears on disc two.  The trailers available on this set are for MoonPhase, Degrassi: The Next Generation, Dragon Ball Z, Full Metal Panic!, and the Z-Store.

The actual episodes that appear on this set are very well-done.  However, I wish FUNimation had gone to a little more effort with the bonus features.  Even with the relative lack of bonus features included on this release, I would still recommend this set to fans of Yu Yu Hakusho, especially if they're interested in owning the series on DVD.

2553775,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"I watched this set and the other season sets like it thanks to a friend of mine. They all have cool extras and the ability to view the episodes in english or japanese, same goes for the season's respective songs which are in the special features somewhere. The character bio thing is cool too.

Yu Yu Hakusho is probably my favorite anime as a kid growing up, yes even more than dbz or tenchi muyo and whatnot (I was a 90's kid). I think the anime ran for an appropriate amount of time, the plot had a good pace (remember, 1 dbz character will take 7 episodes to change a lightbulb. Puu could change it faster). I especially praise season 1 for the plots that involved how corrupt some teachers really can be.

I also loved all of the Yuske - Keiko moments, they are a very realistic couple. Everyone is realistic and can be applied to real world behavior... to some extent anyway. You don't see too much activities from spirit detectives much in the real world.

Any anime fan will probably be happy to own this and I would recommend owning the sets like this. 1 trick I figured out you can do (on my dvd player anyway) is this: start an episode with japanese audio/video with the english texts for that version, then while botan is flying in the opening change it to english audio but don't change the text/video. If you did it right, you would have the japanese video with text for the japanese version but english audio.

2553781,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"This manga is probably the best transfer to anime I've ever seen besides Dragonball or Dragonball Z. But believe me, I like Yuyu Hakusho much better than the Dragonball series for one simple fact: The bosses actually die within an episode or two, rather than hours and hours of ""Got you! No wait... how did you survive that?!"" Throw in the fact that the main character is an old-school street-brawler with a heart of gold and with that you'll see a lot a character development in just a few episodes. This show has a way of being awesome in fight scenes but touching with showing what it means to be human. I really can't make a better reccomendation for a first season.",1238976000,,670,4.5
2553782,5,B000F6ZIFQ,Yu Yu Hakusho is an awesome show about a 14 year-old boy who died and then was brought back to life as a spirit detective to protect the living world from demons and etc. Its worth the price.,1235260800,,191,4.052631578947368
2553783,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Classic title come to an affordable, cool looking box set! This series rivaled DBZ for ratings back in Japan and its not hard to see why. The adventures of Yusuke Urameshi and his team of unique characters go up against those who threaten the stability of the 3 worlds.

2553784,4,B000F6ZIFQ,I enjoyed this season alot. I like the way they had the first few episodes of the Dark Tournament in it.,1224892800,,104,4.0
2553785,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"I'm so glad I bought this box set.  Yu Yu Hakusho is one of my favorite fighting anime ever.  I got hooked watching it on Cartoon Network as a kid and have never regretted watching it. ^_^  This particular boxset is awesome.  It has 2 slimcases with 4 discs total for 28 episodes.  Compared to other anime which put ~4 eps to a disc you get to watch twice as much before having to make the switch. ^_^

Plus the price can't be beat.  I got my set for $21 and will be getting the second season for $19 since I preordered it. I've never seen anime so cheap!  But its still great quality.  I will be ordering the entire series from Amazon because no one else can beat these prices.",1219881600,,678,4.114503816793893
2553786,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Well worth the price
has all the episodes up to the first match of the dark tournament
plus its only 2 disc so its not a big pain to have to put a new disc in maybe every 4 episodes like other season box sets",1218844800,,208,3.6444444444444444
2553787,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Greatest price i have ever gotten for an anime $24 for 28 episodes and it is one of my favorite animes (full metal alchemist, wolfs rain, trigun etc.) unlike other action animes the fights in this series are entertaining and do not last for seasons. This show has 112 episodes in it and a great conclusion. This box set is one of four, the amount of episodes per box set won't bounce around.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho-Season-One-Box-Set/dp/B000F6ZIFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho: Season One Box Set</a>)",1218326400,,579,6.073170731707317
2553788,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Let me just start off by saying that this anime is one of my favorites of all time from when I first seen it on ""toonami"" to when they put in on adult swim.

  Its one of those animes that just keeps you going and grabs your attention when you start to watch it, getting better and better as you go through the episodes. The opening and ending songs are great to listen to and I adore the music of this series. It is one of those animes that you shouldn't pass up. As you watch the show you will laugh, cry, and love the characters, in my opinion there is no character that I didn't like. If you like actiony, funny, a little romance anime then this is for you!

  Another plus that I have to include is that this price is amazingly good and you get 28 episodes in just the first season which is good. So your getting practically 1 episode for less than a dollar, how great is that? So make sure not to pass up this anime, give it a try it will be worth it in the end.",1217376000,,968,3.963917525773196
2553789,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"This show is just amazing! I've been hooked ever since 4th grade, when this show started to air on Cartoon Network. The characters are awesome, the fighting is perplex and, at times, brutal, and at the same time this show has perfect humor. Aside from Dragon Ball Z, this has to be the second greatest anime ever... at least for me. And this show probably IS better, but DBZ was the show I mainly grew up on and it is hard to let another show take its title. But aside from that, this show is probably the best anime show I have ever seen.

I recommend this for fans of Dragon Ball Z, Rurouni Kenshin and Slayers !!",1216166400,,615,4.211864406779661
2553790,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"If you trully enjoy anime series such as Bleach or DBZ this is worth the price. Supposed to be selling for $32 but getting it for $23. Come on, less than $1.00 an episode.... thats pretty much unheard of in this market.

A little side note: This was scheduled to come out July 8th but mine shipped out July 3rd and got it TODAY JULY 7TH.... weird but nice. Amazon really ""F""ed up on this one =)",1215388800,3,394,4.116883116883117
2553791,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"Yu Yu Hakusho is one of my favorite anime of all time. While it's weak in plot structure, it makes up for it with interesting characters and intense battles. The 112-episode series is being re-released a la DBZ in economically friendly, multi-episode seasons. This set contains the first 28 episodes of this classic anime for one low price.

The story goes that Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year old street fighting punk, when having a bad day, saves a young boy's life at the cost of his own. This selfless act was something no one on Earth could predict. No one in the afterlife could predict it either. Thus, the Spirit World sends a guide to tell Yusuke that he can undergo an ordeal to come back to life. And so begins the resurrection of Yusuke and his career as Detective of the Spirit World.

As I said, it's the characters and fight scenes that MAKE this series. The plot is basically one ""tournament""-style battle after another. But the four main enduring fighters uplift the story with their comical arguments and moments of pure cool. There's Yusuke, the snarky lead who cares about others more than he lets on. Kuwabara, the silly comic rival of Yusuke who has a soft spot for the safety of his friends and kittens. Kurama, the cool, collected demon who tries to do all the right things. And then Hiei, the short, angry demon who loves a good fight, and holds deep respect for those he deems worthy.

For this first set, the episodes chronicle the death and resurrection of Yusuke, his first case against three demon thieves, his search for a technique-stealer amongst fighters vying for a Master's teachings, an allied assault against four demons who want to enter the Human World, a rescue mission to save an ice maiden from a greedy mobster, and the first battles of the infamous Dark Tournament.

The English dub is fantastic. As Funimation's second major feature, they demonstrated great ability in casting the key primary and secondary characters. I actually find more joy listening to the dub than the Japanese with subtitles. Most of the original voices just don't feel like they portray the characters to their full potential. Yusuke's lacks the smarmy attitude, Kurama is voiced by a woman, who can't quite pull off the deep cool that is Kurama, Kuwabara is debatable on both sides, as his original voice portrays his comical side well, but not the serious side, and his English voice sounds much deeper, but feels more adapt to all his emotions, and Hiei is the only one who has both voices pull off his angry awesomeness to full effect. Several of the minor characters have decent Japanese voices, but some have very, VERY poor voices(like Rando). Not to say that the dub is perfect, no way, because several of the street punks have unnecessary Brooklyn accents, and some characters like Sayaka and Yukina have mediocre actors.

As for the packaging, its 28 episodes on four discs. These discs are in two thin boxes, making the set very compact and easy to store. The set includes all Japanese audio, and it features subtitles for both languages. The subtitles for the Japanese audio are some of the best put together Funimation has produced. They refer to all artifacts, creatures, and places by their Romanized name(Koma no Ken, Yokai), and only when they introduce the said term that they translate it at the top, making the sub appear like a Fan-sub. Extras are sparse, which include textless opening and closing songs, meager character profiles, and trailers for upcoming Funimation titles. One thing that disappoints me is the lack of a marathon feature that Funimation has included on DBZ and One Piece sets, which allows you to view all the episodes in order without bothering with the extra openings, closings, and teasers.

However, one thing I like is that the DVD menu music is very cool. It sounds somewhat like the music from Jefferson Airship's ""White Rabbit"". It's the sort of music that you close your eyes and lightly bang your head to.

I highly recommend this set to any anime fan, as the fights and animation just keep getting better and better as the series goes. This is a great deal for a great anime.",1215043200,46,4143,4.76183844011142
2553792,4,B000F6ZIFQ,"I'll leave others to give a synopsis of the series, and explain why you should watch this series (basically it's the quintessential shonen anime, having topped DBZ's ratings during both shows life times).

A little bit of backstory: Originally this show came out in what I believe (it's been years) were 3 episode per single DVD releases for about 20-30 bucks each (I'm not even going to get into VHS releases, if there were ever any, I can't remember them). After that run ended, they got put into season sets for about 70-100 bucks a piece. After those sets ended, YYH started to come out as sets of 14 episodes each for about 30 bucks a piece (that run just ended recently). It's for that reason that I ask...why do we need yet ANOTHER re-release of the same episodes (not even remastered like the DBZ episodes, even if that caused controversy) without any extras? Personally, I had been waiting for the 13 episode sets to finish releasing before I decided to buy them. What a waste of money it would have been, had I spent 30 dollars for 13 episodes, when this new set is 23 dollars for 28 episodes? Basically speaking, it's hard to trust that the second this FOURTH set ends, there won't be a remastered set...or a blu-ray set, or something better.

All of that said, I've put off buying YYH for many years now, and at less than a dollar per episode...there is no way I can possibly resist buying it now. I'll still wait to make sure the transfers aren't compressed to fit on fewer discs or something (someone always reviews the video quality with releases like this, and for sets, it's always smart to wait) but otherwise, I can't see anything stopping me from picking this set up. Here's hoping Season 2's set (or 3, 4, 5, etc) have some of the extras like the YYH music videos (with extra, new animation. Very rare and never dubbed into English).",1215043200,4,1854,4.53134328358209
2553793,5,B000F6ZIFQ,"READ THE LAST MESSAGE BELOW ALL THIS. THANKS ^_^
Questions does this have the extras that i love in the first print out. I couldn't tell you cause I don't have this set. I agree with one of guys on here (the dude from GA, ATL) Hey I'm from Ga. I don't understand why put more yu yu hakusho dvds out anyways when they just finished putting out the 2 dvd sets of this entire series. It may have a good price but what about the extras that are included in the first print out which are not included in 2 dvd sets? are they in this season box set or not. I love yu yu hakusho don't get me wrong. I collect everything from them mostly posters and action figures and even the card sets, and yeah I'm a chick dudes but I love anime. Anyways I wish they just stop this really. If you just want to watch the anime that's kwel but i love the extras that are included in the first print out. I got all 33 dvds which is the entire series and the movie. i wish they would have made it shorter sooner. But at least I got my extras which the last dvd was great with the actors together talking about the series and the episodes. It was funny too. And JUSTIN COOK who plays Yusuke is a awesome dude. He plays so many people in the funimation projects. You will see his name everywhere. He is just great as all the other main cast is in this series. but they need to stop making this series into so many different dvd sets. They are a great company and number in my books and they always get great actors and pick great series and weird ones too. So I hope they know what they are doing now. All in all it is a awesome a** series begining to end. If you have seen it, you seriously need to.
Later Smiles ^__^

Ok I'm writing something new to this I went out to my buddy's house and he has this box set and I have to tell there are no extras still. Man that blows. So people stop giving me non helpful marks k, cause if you didn't find it helpful just pass along ok.later",1212969600,2,1953,3.9948849104859336
