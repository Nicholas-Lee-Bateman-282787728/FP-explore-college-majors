5841297,4,B00DPH7Q9S,"Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi, and Yui are all completely normal high school students, until one day when they all start switching bodies. The switches can happen at any time of day, last different amounts of time, and only occur within their little group. After the initial shock, they start trying to just make it through each day without raising suspicion. Then, as suddenly as it started, it stops. Only something else strange has taken its place...

When I initially heard about this series I wasn't the slightest bit interested. I thought it would be filled with awkward/stupid scenes of guys and girls switching bodies. But while there is the awkwardness of guys ending up in their cute female classmates' bodies, it is reasonably handled and then they move on. The thing about this series is that it isn't about the body switching, it is about how the characters handle the body switching and other strange events that happen. The character behind the strangeness seems to be testing the characters', well, character.

One thing that should be noted about this series - it is 17 episodes long, but the last 4 episodes were released separately from the first season. I don't know why this was done, but fortunately, all of it is being released domestically, though in two separate sets. This set has the first 13 episodes and the last four are here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kokoro-Connect-Ova-Complete-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00EZ22926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kokoro Connect Ova: Complete Collection [Blu-ray</a>]. I've only seen the first 13 epsidoes since I watched this on Crunchyroll and that is all they had. I intend to finish the series as soon as the OVA is released here.

This series is an interesting study of people and relationships. It is interesting to consider yourself in their place - what would you do?",1379462400,4,1883,5.333333333333333
5841298,4,B00DPH7Q9S,"We all wear a mask.  Everyday we put on our mask as we walk out the door for fear that people will see who we truly are.  We often wear different masks around different people, because we want various people to perceive us in various ways.  We even lie to ourselves pretending that we are more good, more wise, more strong, more happy, more beautiful, or more brave than we really are.  For most people, the only fear greater than knowing who we truly are, is the horror that others might realize who we truly are as well.

Kokoro Connect is an excellent series.  It allows the viewer to truly feel the fear of their inner being laid bare for others to see.  In each of 4 arcs, a god causes some sort of phenomenon to occur to the 5 characters that allows--and forces--them to see parts of each other's lives which they would normally keep hidden.  For example in the first arc, the god causes the 5 to switch bodies with each other at random times.  Thus these five friends, who have never shared the naked truth of their family lives, or lives outside of school in general, now experience each other's lives first-hand.  The series makes you realize how little you may know those people that are closest too you, and it forces you to be honest about how little you allow others to know yourself.

I apologize for what I'm about to say, because I'm about to commit one of my own pet peeves...  As awesome as the series is, I have to complain about the way it's being released.  Kokoro Connect is a 17 episode series.  Depending on the time-block one airs in, a season of anime is between 11 and 13 episodes.  For this reason, the last four episodes were aired as specials.  These last four episodes are not included in the set; they are being released separately.

Most of the time in anime OVAs are side stories:  extra background material, or the obligatory beach/hot springs event...  This is not the case with Kokoro Connect.  It's not until this final arc of the series that the character development really ties together.  If I didn't know and I bought this set for $60, I would be aggravated to find out I needed to spend another $35 so that I could have the last 4 episodes of the series.

Again, Kokoro Connect is excellent.  It has great characters and deep emotion.  It's hard to recommend buying it with the way it's being released, but it is definitely a show you should watch.",1379462400,26,2611,4.831081081081081
5841299,5,B00DPH7Q9S,"Kokoro Connect is a series that is a total buy and should definitely be a part of your anime collection. Following the members of the Cultural Research Club, the ties of friendship are put to the ultimate test as secrets become known and viewpoints become jumbled by way of phenomenon such as switching bodies and sharing emotions brought upon by an entity known as Heartseed. Will they be able to overcome the obstacles brought upon them or will their friendship break under the weight of newly revealed feelings and thoughts?

I watched this series already and I can tell you that this is one of the best I've seen in awhile. Consisting of 4 arcs each with their own problem and phenomenon, these 5 friends are truly put to the test of their connection to each other. Every single character gets a full backstory and time to shine and develop all the way throughout. Music all around is done very well, with a separate ending song for every arc giving a feeling of adjoining to the one before instead of a continuation. Animation is also done very well with characters resembling a mix of K-ON! style and Yuuta from Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai. And the story throughout is done very well, not throwing in filler episodes or un-needed plot lines. And after the final episode I couldn't help but think ""I WANT MORE OF THIS SHOW!!""

Kokoro Connect is a series that I can not recommend enough. Whether you have or haven't seen this series, you will enjoy it I guarantee. Buy it and I know you will not regret it.

Other shows I recommend are the love story ""Toradora!"" and the anime ""Anohana"", each of which are very good buys and ones that you should not miss.",1375920000,33,1661,4.548494983277592

The story centers around five friends who become the ""toys"" of a supernatural being called Heartseed; randomly, these five friends will swap bodies, their consciousnesses swapping around without warning, and at any time. That's just part 1 of the whole adventure too. Overall, the story is a lot of fun, and it's one I recommend. The dub is pretty alright, not the best, but certainly could be worse. Also be sure to get the OVA collection too, to get 4 more episodes that were not included here.",1442707200,,657,4.43801652892562
