1668637,2,B00005UWA1,"Satan's Cheerleaders (Greydon Clark, 1977)

Greydon Clark made some of the crappiest movies in film history, and he did it more unapologetically than anyone since Edward D. Wood, Jr. (That includes the time since Clark's retirement from the business in 1998.) Clark's oeuvre included blaxploitation (Black Shampoo), sci-fi (The Return, the infamous Jan-Michael Vincent cattle mutilation flick), socially-conscious exploitation (Skinheads), dance-craze movies (Lambada: The Forbidden Dance), and pretty much everything in between. This includes his third film, a nod to the Satanic horror flick craze of the seventies. While it treads much the same ground as such psychedelic highlights (or lowlights?) of the genre as Corman's take on The Dunwich Horror (1971) or Ron Hanthaner's The House on Skull Mountain (1974), it's obvious from the get-go that Greydon Clark was an exploitation filmmaker from the beginning, and not of the Corman variety, either.

Plot: a bunch of cheerleaders get diverted on their way to the Big Game (which is always said with the initial caps, natch) by the school's janitor/bus driver (Jack Kruschen, a character actor probably best remembered for his role in the original Cape Fear), who is not only a janitor and a bus driver, but also a talent scout for a band of Satan worshippers who are looking for a virgin sacrifice. (Among cheerleaders. In the seventies. Really?) They find some help in the form of a local bum (John Carradine) who tries to warn them away from the cult, but to no avail. So now they're all prisoners and have to find a way to escape before one of them gets sacrificed. But the great mystery... which one of them is a virgin?

When Satan's Cheerleaders is remembered now, which thankfully is not often, it is because of beginnings and endings. As befits a flick in which Jack Kruschen has a leading role, a number of folks in this flick went on to steady, if not necessarily prosperous, work as TV character actors, including Robin Greer (Falcon Crest), Hilary Thomas (Happy Days), and Kerrie Sherman (Days of Our Lives). As for endings, it was the final film Sydney Chaplin, Charlie's son, made before retiring. I wish I could say it was a fitting farewell. * ",1285027200,10,2214,4.991869918699187
1668638,5,B00005UWA1,"I have no idea how many stars to give this movie. It had bad acting, a dumb plot, and a bizarre premise which was sort of 1970s-b-movie-cheerleader-sex-farce-comedy meets creepy-Satanic-cult-horror-b-movie and the result is astonishingly bad. I mean I've seen a lot of bad, stupid movies based on dumb ideas and this was one of the worst conceived ever. It hurt, but once it was over I decided it was a good hurt. Yeah, five stars is a little much. Er . . . a lot much, but go to Youtube or browse the net and you can find the trailer for this thing and get some feel for it yourself.",1255737600,4,584,4.318181818181818

1668640,1,B00005UWA1,"This is one movie I'd been planning to check out for a while. Naughty cheerleaders, Satanic cults -- it sounded right up my alley.  And best of all it had Mrs. Lily Munster and 40s horror actor John Carradine in it.  This sounded like it could be a lot of fun.

Man was I wrong!

First of all, none of the ""cheerleaders"" is even remotely hot looking. -- Strike one on the titillation factor.

Second of all, these people know absolutely nothing about Satanism and even the altar props and pentagram necklaces look like things they threw together themselves on a budget of about $1.  Although their inept attempts at portraying a fantasy Satanism had no menace or scare potential, I thought they still could be amusing in a very cheesy B-movie sort of way.  But instead all they ended up being is just extremely boring. -- Strike two on the Satanic factor.

And third, even though I love Yvonne Decarlo, her talents are completely wasted on one ultra-dull and stupid script.  I'm a fan of B-movies, but this movie just had absolutely nothing to offer (except maybe being used as a tool to put me to sleep!).  -- So strike three and this movie ends up out on the pile of garbage films I bought and hated and never want to see again.

About the only thing worthwhile I think it had was a couple of very catchy little disco numbers in the soundtrack that somebody should add to a compilation of obscure 70s disco treasures.  But other than that, it deserves to be lost and forgotten in the wilderness of worthless junk.

I definitely do not recommend wasting your money on this one.  If you want cheesy B-movies, there are PLENTY of others better than this. (--or worse, depending on how you look at it!)  This is just a waste of your time and money.  End of story.",1184371200,3,1761,4.45625
1668641,2,B00005UWA1,"Greydon Clark...actor, writer, director, and producer...what's that?  You're not familiar with the name?  Not surprising, as Mr. Clark's artistic talents are primarily confined to the exploitative side of cinema, leaving his mark (skid mark would probably be more appropriate, like the kind left in someone's shorts), with such features as Satan's Sadists (1969), Hell's Bloody Devils (1970), Dracula Vs. Frankenstein (1971), Psychic Killer (1975), The Bad Bunch (1976), Angels' Brigade (1980), Joysticks (1983), Lambada, the Forbidden Dance (1990), along with this little bum nugget titled Satan's Cheerleaders (1977).  Co-written and directed by Clark, the film features John Ireland (A Walk in the Sun, Railroaded!, All the King's Men), Yvonne De Carlo (Brute Force, Criss Cross, The Ten Commandments), and John Carradine (Stagecoach, The Grapes of Wrath, The Ten Commandments), all of who had most certainly seen better days, cinematically speaking.  Also appearing is character actor Jack Kruschen (The War of the Worlds, The Apartment, ""Webster""), Jacqueline Cole (Angels' Brigade, Joysticks), Kerry Sherman (""The Bionic Boy"", ""Santa Barbara""), Hillary Horan (Young Doctors in Love), Alisa Powell (The Toolbox Murders), Sherry Marks (Hometown USA), Lane Caudell (""Days of Our Lives""), and Sydney Chaplin (So Evil, My Sister), son of legendary silent screen star Charles Chaplin.

The movie begins with a poorly lit scene featuring some robed individuals performing some kind of ceremony in the woods at night.  After this, we're taken to a sunny beach scene, where some high school students are playing touch football and we get to meet the nubile cheerleading squad of Benedict High School...there's Patti (Sherman), the petite blonde, Chris (Horan), the slightly chubby brunette, Sharon (Marks), the extremely well developed (in terms of body, not brains) sandy haired blonde, Debbie (Powell), the slutty one, and their coach Ms. Johnson (Cole), who's about the most idiotically naive character I've seen in a film in a long time.  Some members of a rival school show up, words are exchanged, a `chicken' fight ensues, some water balloons are thrown, and Debbie gets it on with a player in the bushes.  The girls head back to school for a shower scene (a lame one at that)  prior to leaving for the big game, and are spied upon by Billy (Kruschen), the creepy janitor, who surely hates those uppity kids.  Oh yeah, Billy is also a part of the Satanic cult seen earlier in the film...go figure.  The girls don their uniforms (complete with t-shirts featuring their names on the front), Debbie gets it on with the quarterback, and they all leave for the game.  Some car trouble ensues, and Billy just happens to come along, offers them a ride, but kidnaps them in the process (Billy's taken a real shine to Patti), and Debbie offers herself up in exchange for freedom.  The girls manage to escape, find the local sheriff (Ireland), and are home free, right?  Wrong...turns out the sheriff and his wife (De Carlo) are in the cult too, and are planning a sacrificial ceremony, one where a pure maiden will be offered up, but this poses a problem as there's nary a one in the bunch...or is there?  The girls escape again, but get caught again, and Debbie offers up herself in exchange for freedom...again...yeah, okay, we get it, Debbie's like a doorknob, everyone gets a turn...some more stuff happens and Satan, represented by a cheap wooden mask and an even cheaper red solarization effect, makes the scene...oh bruther...

I really do enjoy oddball, exploitive features from the 60s and 70s, but I have to admit, even for Greydon Clark, Satan's Cheerleaders was a real stinker.  The acting, the directing, the script, it all suffers here (along with the audience).  My favorite character here had to be Billy, the lecherous janitor, played by the multi-purpose, ethnic character actor Jack Kruschen whom many might remember as 'Papa' Papadapolis from the early 80s TV series ""Webster"".  Be sure to get a good look at his off work apparel, which consisted of snazzy polyester leisure wear and denim shirts festooned with rhinestones.  The girls, who would have been interchangeable had they not been wearing their names on the front of their T-shirts, spent most of the time either getting, or making, not so subtle innuendoes (""I'm wild about your backfield in motion!"") or remarks with regards to their own lack of virtue...near the end, when the coven is trying to find an unsoiled maiden in the bunch, Chris blurts out ""Are you kidding me?  I'm no maiden...I've been a cheerleader for three years!"" ...and I didn't get the impression she said that as a way to get out of being sacrificed (none of the girls were that smart), but more so because it was true...lovely.  This was the extent of the comedy, which would often feature some screwy tuba music to try and help punctuate the intent of being humorous...it worked, but not through any intentional efforts put forth by those making the film.  Carradine's character is kind of interesting (albeit pointless), appearing for about a total of five minutes on the screen.  He's credited as `The Bum', a drifter type whom the girls run across a couple of times.  Check out the scene where, after the girls escape from the sheriff and split up, Debbie comes across Carradine's character and Carradine goes into his own little scene like Debbie wasn't even there.  As far as Ireland and De Carlo, they seemed like they were trying to make the best out of it, knee deep in swill as they were...a job's a job (and a check's a check), I suppose.  De Carlo hams it up pretty well, especially when she's spouting the devil speak, but gets shortchanged near the end as her finale occurs off screen.  And then there's Ireland as the sheriff and leader of the coven...he has two Doberman Pinchers, named Lucifer and Diablo (oh bruther), a pentagram hanging over the fireplace mantle, and a shrine of evil behind a curtain in the living room.  Oh yeah, he and his fellow worshippers also have a tendency to wear their colorful cult robes around in broad daylight, indicating either the entire town is in on the evil shenanigans, or there's just an overall sloppiness of the coven in general...as for the coven, they were perhaps the least frightening, most unorganized, grabasstic gaggle of devil worshipers I've ever seen...and I've seen a few, cinematically speaking.  I sincerely doubted Satan would have aligned himself with such an incompetent gaggle of boneheads.  If you're looking for sleaze, there's not a lot (not as much as I'd hoped), and the nekkidness, while present, is minimal, limited to Ms. Sherman showing off her boobery in a couple of scenes.

The picture, presented in fullscreen, on this VCI Entertainment DVD looks about as good as you'd expect a low rent production from the 70s would, meaning it's watchable, but does have significant flaws throughout.  The Dolby Digital mono audio does come through well enough.  The artwork on the main menu page is about the shoddiest I've ever seen, so much so someone at VCI should see about getting a refund.  As far as extras go, there's a couple of rough trailers, one for this film, and another for one called Ruby (1977).

1668642,2,B00005UWA1,"Oh no! That nefarious mastermind satan is at it again. In his neverending quest for world domination, he's decided to go after our beloved cheerleaders! Four of them were on their way to the big Huskies game when suddenly, their car was run off the road! One of satan's helpers just happened to drive by and pick them up. This evil man was none other than Billy (Jack ""Angry Red Planet"" Kruschen), the school janitor / peeping-Tom pervert! He took these poor girls, and their morally upstanding instructor, to a deserted location. Once there, Billy tried to do naughty things to Patti, while Debbie, Sharon, and Chris stood petrified in trances! Thankfully, a jealous satan intervened, knocking Billy out. Whew! Our brave pom-pom commandoes then ran into a bum (John Carradine) who also turned out to be one of the devil's deciples! They ended up at the home of sheriff BL Bubb (John Ireland) and his wife (Yvonne DeCarlo). Sadly, Mr. and Mrs. Bubb were in on the whole thing! In fact, the entire town was nothing more than a coven of mephistophelian hillbillies! They locked up our brave heroines, preparing them for midnight sacrifice. Of course, they needed a ""pure maiden"" or virgin for this blackest of rituals, so our cheerleaders were saved! Then, Patti had a little surprise for the Bubbs and company, as she turned out to be the dark lord's chosen one. She quickly used her powers to kill the shady sheriff and to establish herself as queen of all satanic cheerleaders. This is a true story...",1073088000,5,1502,4.758620689655173

7955462,2,B00005UWA1,"So-bad-they're-good movies weren't meant to be funny.  Had they been, that attempt would have failed along with every other effort involving the film.  It's only when cinematic creators strive to produce an engaging, well-paced feature--and flunk--that genuine humor can be found in a bad movie.  Most substandard flicks are boring at best and insufferable at worst.  They're intended as quick-buck hack pieces or even ill-formed, ephemeral artistic expressions.  If there's simply no cogent plot nor skill nor enthusiasm from writers, directors, or actors, the result will be a total flop.
Satan's Cheerleaders is certainly of the genre of cheapo, softly sexploitational flicks that no viewer expects to be good.  One would imagine that competent actors like John Ireland, Yvonne DeCarlo, and John Carradine would be utterly wasted in such a debacle--either in one-take cameos or in straitjacketed portrayals that would squelch even the ability of an Olivier.  Not so, however.  Carradine's bum character is tailor-made for a thespian of his talents, and he plays it to the subtly satired hilt.  Ireland simply casts his skills aside and phones in a flat reading of his lines--seemingly in an attempt at humor--and, to a point, succeeds.  DeCarlo gives it her utmost, but in a portrayal that requires her to repeatedly mumble a weird hybrid of Satanic/Wiccan incantations, she merely comes off as ridiculous.  Her performance, however, is the closest the movie comes to being so bad it's good.
Charactor actor Jack Kruschen gives his janitor role a decent effort, but the remainder of the cast is, for the most part, composed of non-actors and those of marginal abilities.  The action takes almost forever to move beyond cheerleaders flashing their legs to an actual plot--a limp, plodding one that is kept barely breathing by the intermittent presences of Ireland, DeCarlo, and/or Carradine.  The trio does, however, supply just enough sardonic zest to make such a grade-Z feature worth a look--well, maybe....",1331337600,2,2012,5.289308176100629
