8175097,2,B000N6BHTY,"Cramming the life of Ulysses S. Grant into thirty minutes is impossible  and insulting to the memory of a great American. This documentary barely  skims the surface and relies upon hackneyed legends and common stock  photographs, which they use over and over again.
There is no detailed  explanation of Grant's rich private life or family, his astute and  brilliant generaliship during the Civil War or his flawed Presidency. The  narrative limps along, omitting major events in Grant's life and boring the  viewer in the process.
If you want to discover Ulysses S. Grant, read  some of the excellent biographies of him. He was a grand man with a  fascinating life and this documentary doesn't begin to illuminate his heart  and soul.",962582400,8,734,4.991735537190083
