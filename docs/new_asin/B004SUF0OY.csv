8440264,4,B004SUF0OY,"This is a pretty great blu ray movie that is the finale to Liar Game. It doesnt really have any special features, but the english subtitles were surprisingly good and the picture quality was better than I thought it would be.

If you watched the show, this is definitely worth picking up to get a little more closure. The story is pretty much what you'd expect and the characters are fun and wacky just like the show. I enjoyed it just as much as the main show.

Also this blu ray works for region A players in case anyone needs to know. I did not experience any issues.",1513296000,,570,4.268518518518518
