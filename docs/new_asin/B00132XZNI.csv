3101644,5,B00132XZNI,"Excellent story,
Every American family needs to watch this film and discuss it with their children.
A must see movie.",1230076800,3,117,4.9
3101645,4,B00132XZNI,"Every year teaching WWII to my 8th graders, I face the same question that Mr. Ross has to answer... the guiding question for the film. How could Hitler's followers be swept up in the Nazi movement so quickly and so completely? And how could they just stand by and allow millions of people, their friends and neighbors, be murdered in the Holocaust and then say later that they didn't know?

It puts into real life, present(ish)-day terms the dangers of the mob mentality. In teaching about the rise of leaders like Hitler, Mussolini and even Stalin and Mao, I find myself frequently referencing The Wave to help new information click for my kids. Whenever they can't quite wrap their heads around why people would follow a dictator like that, I just remind them of Mr. Ross' class, and their faces instantly show a new flicker of understanding. At about 45 minutes, it's also the perfect length. They pack a lot into a small package and use flashes of meaningful imagery to make the message more quick and intense.

Truthfully, I didn't expect my students to get as much out of this film as they did. In fact, months later, they still mention the film in their own examples while answering questions in class. They even ask me sometimes if we can watch it again! The Wave will definitely be staying in my professional repertoire as a valuable tool for teaching middle and high school world history.

The cons: The acting is mediocre and over-the-top (It was originally intended to be an After-School Special, after all), but even my most discriminating 8th grade audiences very quickly saw past that and became wrapped up in the story. Also, the film quality is fairly poor. It reminded me of watching tv in the 80's on my grandparent's old rabbit-eared, turn-knob cabinet tv. But again, amazingly, my kids almost immediately saw past that. Finally, the dvd lacks some fairly standard features. For instance, there is no ""scene selection"" screen and fast forwarding/rewinding must be done manually. There are no chapters, which made finishing up the movie the next day a little time-consuming. There are no subtitles or alternate languages.",1227484800,30,2140,4.857534246575343
3101646,3,B00132XZNI,"I was so excited to see that ""The Wave"" was on DVD that I purchased it for use in my High School Government classes.  The kids enjoyed it (even though the clothes and hair styles seriously dated it).  The big negative is that you can't jump to a particular scene. Once you start viewing it, you're pretty much committed to see it all the way through.

In addition to that, it would have been nice if the producers could have cleaned it up a bit.  It looks like they just transferred it directly from tape to disc.

But aside from all that, it was scary to see how easily a class (or, as was being demonstrated, a country) of individuals could so willingly become drones slavishly committed to a charasmatic (and, in the case of Germany, psychotic) leader.  No matter how old the movie is, the painful lesson remains.",1227312000,19,816,4.442953020134228

3101659,4,B00132XZNI,"The Wave is an outstanding film that teaches an important lesson to all whether young or old. Although the graphics have what to be desired, the film is still an eight on a scale of one to ten.

When a student in Palo Alto California asks the teacher (Bruce Davison) why nobody did anything when the Nazis killed over six million people, Mr. Ross goes to great length to explain.

Although The Wave is a mere 46 minutes long, the lesson is obvious and hits to close to home. It is astonishing and emotional to see the reactions of the students when they comprehend the goal of the lesson, most are disappointed, some are silent, and a few even cry.

Regardless of the terrible graphics, The Wave is worth every minute of it. The moral of the movie is important, fantastic, and obviously applicable to us, the American people. How would we react in a similar situation? Would we bend into peer pressure? Or would we stand up for what is right regardless of the consequences?",1459814400,,973,4.517045454545454
3101660,4,B00132XZNI,"I used this in a psychology class with the Lesson Plan:... It provided excellent teaching points on experimentation, informed consent, human behavior. The Lesson Plan video really increases the poignancy of the lesson having the actual subjects speak to what they felt then and feel now, along with the clips from the era providing a historical setting which was very powerful with the Hitler clips, and Vietnam era clips. I strongly encourage teachers of the social sciences to use these two videos, and the short read from the original novel.",1459209600,,544,5.055555555555555

3101669,3,B00132XZNI,"Just saw this the other day. It only gets three stars because the production values are not great, the film looks quite dated, and it tries to do too much in its 44 minute run time. However, as a statement against collectivism, it is very valuable. This is an excellent film to show students to warn them against the dangers of ""group think."" The film uses the Nazis as an (obvious) example of how easily people become sheep. However, the warning the film offers could be applied to modern modes of group think occurring on both the left and right sides of the political aisle. In an age when individuality is so thoroughly threatened, little films like this can go a long way to saving humanity from total submission to the tyranny of the masses.",1425513600,,747,4.54074074074074

3101675,5,B00132XZNI,"I saw this movie on TV more than 25 years ago.  It had such a profound effect on me that the memory of it haunts me to this day.  The message is as true, and we are every bit as vulnerable today as when Hitler reigned supreme.  What a brilliant man this teacher was.  How perceptive to the need to feel and understand the human psyche.  We're all, every one of us, vulnerable to a leader such as Hitler without the reminders such as this movie.  I see the same hungering to be part ""of a movement"" today as in Hitler's day and the mind-boggling decisions made because of that.  The Pied Piper leading the masses.  It takes education and effort to resist the pull of the psyche.  For decades I've searched for a video, then a dvd of this movie.  I don't understand why it doesn't get more attention or isn't replayed on TV.  Yet mindless, senseless garbage is rerun over and over again.  I'm so thankful to have found this dvd at long last and will share it with anybody and everybody.",1403481600,6,984,4.288043478260869

3101677,4,B00132XZNI,"I saw this as a freshman in high school many years ago and showed it to my class when we were reading The Boy In The Striped Pajamas after one of them asked how the Germans could have been so easily persuaded. It worked like a charm, just like it did 25 years ago when my teacher showed it to us. Some oldies are still very valuable to use as teaching tools!",1401062400,,358,3.986111111111111
3101678,5,B00132XZNI,"Long before the internet a High School teacher in Palo Alto got his students to play the crowd-sourcing game. And the students got caught up in the hype. This really happened. It's a true story. (There's a German version too, from 2008, called Die Welle). It is the ultimate classroom mind-game. A charismatic teacher suddenly introduces strict discipline into his lessons and, far from rebelling, the students embrace it with gusto. Within a week, they have devised a uniform, insignia, salute and banners, and eagerly spy on and intimidate schoolmates. The movement swells to more than 200 members who, on the last day, flock to a rally. - telegraph co uk.",1398297600,,658,4.936936936936937
3101679,5,B00132XZNI,"This film doesn't even take an hour.  It is so well acted, the scripting so tight and economical that this crucially important social and historical lesson doesn't need any more than 47 minutes.

I have used it with my sociology students and in my efforts to help educate folks about religious cults.

If you can deal with the age of the movie (1970 or so), you will have an excellent tool to make the point that people tend to be sheep and that everyone needs to learn to lead his life with his head, not his heart.",1391990400,,515,4.191919191919192

3101682,5,B00132XZNI,"I showed this movie to my history class. We are studing the Holocaust, and several of the students couldn't understand
how the German people could embrass Hitler and the Nazi party. This movie opened their eyes to how people can become
entangled in a movement. It started some great discussion.  This was the first time any of my students had ever seen or heard of this movie. They really liked the fact that it was based on something that really did occur in this country. It's a nice way to show real history.",1382140800,,511,4.494623655913978
3101683,5,B00132XZNI,"My friend recommended this to me based on a fictional piece I am currently writing and I was very taken by the whole aspect. This is based on a true story and if you don't have time to read the book, I would highly recommend the movie.

A teacher who has just taught on World War II and Nazi Germany is posed a question by his students. Who would ever do such a thing? This question sets off an experiment that starts off innocently enough until the students begin to fall victim to it. The teacher is surprised by the reactions of his class, but sets up a perfect ending so that the lesson is driven home.

I don't want to give anymore away, but I will suffice it to say if you can get past the poor acting, 1970's styles and a bit of hokiness, you may just find it profound and thought provoking.",1377216000,,798,4.141935483870967

The movie, however, is definitely old school and not very exciting at all.  On a positive note, it made for great discussion concerning how books can be so much more interesting since they include additional and very relevant facts that make for a more interesting storyline. The movie was short and sweet and showable in a class period and unfortunately a disappointment to my students (considering what they are used to viewing nowadays).  It stuck to the basic storyline, but offered no insight into the characters' personalities or backgrounds, which was one of the things that helped my students to initially connect with the text.

I won't go over any fine details except to say that the copy I watched was the ""instant video"" version as a rental, so I was able to stop and start wherever I pleased.  I am now ordering the video to own the copy.  There is also a German version of this available.  It is also well worth the watch.  It follows the American movie much of the time except for some German cultural things and extra items not seen in the American version (or the book that it was based on, and which you should also read).  Be aware that the German version carries the idea further and has a very shocking ending.  However, all within the realm of possibility and even probability under the right circumstances.

character and dialogue driven). The quality of the film was a bit blurry and shotty but that's most likely
because it is from '81 and transferredfrom VHS. Otherwise, good purchase. Bruce Davison before

The price is right for this DVD, because it's the best quality that's available and although it's made in 1981 the subject is still current.

This movie is about the 2nd World War and is probably the best anwer anyone would be able to give to the question:

How could the Germans sit back while the Nazi's slaughtered people all around them and say they didn't know anything about it? How could they do that, how could they say that?

3101711,5,B00132XZNI,"Palo Alto High School April 1967.
Ben Ross a very gifted history teacher was showing his students  a black and white film reel of Nazi Germany.
As the film ended the bell to signal the end of the lesson rang and everyone left the room.
2:40 am. Ben Ross lay awake, what disturbed him was he had failed to answer Lorrie's question.
If he could not answer a question then he was a failure.
If he was a failure he wondered if the students would still like him, if they would still respect him, and if they appreciated what he did for them.

THE NEXT DAY
The students entered the room and took their seats. Mr Ross explained to the class, today we will experience power ,control, and discipline.

The first demonstration that Mr Ross thought of was how to sit up straight while sitting still.

He wanted the class to place their hands on their lower backs and arch their spines.
His experiment was a success, but Mr Ross was not impressed.
Quote.  (Mr Ross there are three rules that you must obey).
1 You must stand at the side of your seats.
2 When asking or answering a question your first words are Mr Ross.
3 When giving your answers make them as short as possible.
That evening Ben told his wife Christine about his experiments and how the class response was immediate.
She reminded him that their response was genuine but Christine was wrong.

Mr Ross entered his classroom, his students dutifully waiting.
 He asks the class what they are feeling.
We feel disciplined was their answer.

 Mr Ross gave his students a community, a salute, and a symbol.
He had gained movement direction and impact.
In the years to come they would be known as the Wave.

Palo Alto high school 1970
By now what had begun as a harmless idea had turned into a full blown school dictatorship.
All students and teachers were conscripted to wear pale blue uniforms, the symbol of the wave stamped over their hearts.
All usual school activities were band.
The male prefects were given permission to have gun licences.
If you were caught by a male prefect you were taken outside the school to be shot and killed.

 The female prefects were given permission to use the sauna as a miniature gas chamber.
If you were caught by a female prefect you were to report to the sauna to be gassed and killed.

Some departments were still allowed to operate due to the Waves cause such as woodwork, metalwork, sewing and outdoor education.

The class assignment was to make coffins.
The metalwork class assignment was to make bullets.
 The sewers were in charge of making and designing arm bands.
As for outdoor education that was narrowed down to three activities only.
Target shooting, an obstacle course and a military style march.
 As for Mr Ross he had become a man driven by power, pride and self contemp.
On the last day of that year Mr Ben Ross was fired, and  he never taught again.

In 1972 the school received word that their corrupted history teacher had taken his own life.
The Wave is the best short film ever made.
It also scored the most watched film in American TV. history.

I would rate this film one of the best films of my lifetime.

3336142,4,B00132XZNI,"Every year teaching WWII to my 8th graders, I face the same question that Mr. Ross has to answer... the guiding question for the film. How could Hitler's followers be swept up in the Nazi movement so quickly and so completely? And how could they just stand by and allow millions of people, their friends and neighbors, be murdered in the Holocaust and then say later that they didn't know?

It puts into real life, present(ish)-day terms the dangers of the mob mentality. In teaching about the rise of leaders like Hitler, Mussolini and even Stalin and Mao, I find myself frequently referencing The Wave to help new information click for my kids. Whenever they can't quite wrap their heads around why people would follow a dictator like that, I just remind them of Mr. Ross' class, and their faces instantly show a new flicker of understanding. At about 45 minutes, it's also the perfect length. They pack a lot into a small package and use flashes of meaningful imagery to make the message more quick and intense.

Truthfully, I didn't expect my students to get as much out of this film as they did. In fact, months later, they still mention the film in their own examples while answering questions in class. They even ask me sometimes if we can watch it again! The Wave will definitely be staying in my professional repertoire as a valuable tool for teaching middle and high school world history.

The cons: The acting is mediocre and over-the-top (It was originally intended to be an After-School Special, after all), but even my most discriminating 8th grade audiences very quickly saw past that and became wrapped up in the story. Also, the film quality is fairly poor. It reminded me of watching tv in the 80's on my grandparent's old rabbit-eared, turn-knob cabinet tv. But again, amazingly, my kids almost immediately saw past that. Finally, the dvd lacks some fairly standard features. For instance, there is no ""scene selection"" screen and fast forwarding/rewinding must be done manually. There are no chapters, which made finishing up the movie the next day a little time-consuming. There are no subtitles or alternate languages.",1227484800,30,2140,4.857534246575343

The kids enjoyed it (even though the clothes and hair styles seriously dated it).  The big negative is that you can't jump to a particular scene. Once you start viewing it, you're pretty much committed to see it all the way through.

In addition to that, it would have been nice if the producers could have cleaned it up a bit.  It looks like they just transferred it directly from tape to disc.

But aside from all that, it was scary to see how easily a class (or, as was being demonstrated, a country) of individuals could so willingly become drones slavishly committed to a charasmatic (and, in the case of Germany, psychotic) leader.  No matter how old the movie is, the painful lesson remains.",1227312000,19,816,4.442953020134228

When a student in Palo Alto California asks the teacher (Bruce Davison) why nobody did anything when the Nazis killed over six million people, Mr. Ross goes to great length to explain.

Although The Wave is a mere 46 minutes long, the lesson is obvious and hits to close to home. It is astonishing and emotional to see the reactions of the students when they comprehend the goal of the lesson, most are disappointed, some are silent, and a few even cry.

Regardless of the terrible graphics, The Wave is worth every minute of it. The moral of the movie is important, fantastic, and obviously applicable to us, the American people.

The movie, however, is definitely old school and not very exciting at all.  On a positive note, it made for great discussion concerning how books can be so much more interesting since they include additional and very relevant facts that make for a more interesting storyline. The movie was short and sweet and showable in a class period and unfortunately a disappointment to my students (considering what they are used to viewing nowadays).  It stuck to the basic storyline, but offered no insight into the characters' personalities or backgrounds, which was one of the things that helped my students to initially connect with the text.

I won't go over any fine details except to say that the copy I watched was the ""instant video"" version as a rental, so I was able to stop and start wherever I pleased.  I am now ordering the video to own the copy.  There is also a German version of this available.  It is also well worth the watch.  It follows the American movie much of the time except for some German cultural things and extra items not seen in the American version (or the book that it was based on, and which you should also read).

3336208,5,B00132XZNI,"Palo Alto High School April 1967.
Ben Ross a very gifted history teacher was showing his students  a black and white film reel of Nazi Germany.
As the film ended the bell to signal the end of the lesson rang and everyone left the room.
2:40 am. Ben Ross lay awake, what disturbed him was he had failed to answer Lorrie's question.
If he could not answer a question then he was a failure.
If he was a failure he wondered if the students would still like him, if they would still respect him, and if they appreciated what he did for them.

THE NEXT DAY
The students entered the room and took their seats. Mr Ross explained to the class, today we will experience power ,control, and discipline.

The first demonstration that Mr Ross thought of was how to sit up straight while sitting still.

He wanted the class to place their hands on their lower backs and arch their spines.
His experiment was a success, but Mr Ross was not impressed.
Quote.  (Mr Ross there are three rules that you must obey).
1 You must stand at the side of your seats.
2 When asking or answering a question your first words are Mr Ross.
3 When giving your answers make them as short as possible.
That evening Ben told his wife Christine about his experiments and how the class response was immediate.
She reminded him that their response was genuine but Christine was wrong.

Mr Ross entered his classroom, his students dutifully waiting.
 He asks the class what they are feeling.
We feel disciplined was their answer.

 Mr Ross gave his students a community, a salute, and a symbol.
He had gained movement direction and impact.
In the years to come they would be known as the Wave.

Palo Alto high school 1970
By now what had begun as a harmless idea had turned into a full blown school dictatorship.
All students and teachers were conscripted to wear pale blue uniforms, the symbol of the wave stamped over their hearts.
All usual school activities were band.
The male prefects were given permission to have gun licences.
If you were caught by a male prefect you were taken outside the school to be shot and killed.

 The female prefects were given permission to use the sauna as a miniature gas chamber.
If you were caught by a female prefect you were to report to the sauna to be gassed and killed.

Some departments were still allowed to operate due to the Waves cause such as woodwork, metalwork, sewing and outdoor education.

The class assignment was to make coffins.
The metalwork class assignment was to make bullets.
 The sewers were in charge of making and designing arm bands.
As for outdoor education that was narrowed down to three activities only.
Target shooting, an obstacle course and a military style march.
 As for Mr Ross he had become a man driven by power, pride and self contemp.
On the last day of that year Mr Ben Ross was fired, and  he never taught again.

In 1972 the school received word that their corrupted history teacher had taken his own life.
The Wave is the best short film ever made.
It also scored the most watched film in American TV. history.

I would rate this film one of the best films of my lifetime.
