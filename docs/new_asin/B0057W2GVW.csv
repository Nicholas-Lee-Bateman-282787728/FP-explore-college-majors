8461173,5,B0057W2GVW,"Gets a WELL earned 7.5 favorable from the IMDB . An extremely taut and involving thriller wrapped up in the story of a sensational newspaper editor (Broderick Crawford) , his journalists and his past . Young John Derek , Donna Reed and a brilliantly dissipated older reporter (Henry O'Neill) are all sensational in supporting roles . Superbly directed by the oft brilliant Phil Karlson from a story by Samuel Fuller who was a newspaper reporter prior to his film making career . Suitably cynical and crackerjack . One of it's year's best I'm sure . No padding ninety minutes leaves you wanting more . Seek it out . Blimjo",1496880000,,621,4.706422018348624
