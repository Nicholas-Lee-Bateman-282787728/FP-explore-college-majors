8309645,4,B001HUOUG2,"This movie stars Lon Chaney (1883-1930) who was the son of deaf mutes. He was the father of Lon Chaney, Jr. His first film was in 1912. He was a highly acclaimed actor in his time. This film was released in 1921. It is a black and white silent film. Films with speech did not start until 1927, with the Jazz Singer, which was a great success.
I felt that Chaney over-acted. He expressed emotions over-much. But I am sure others will disagree. The film itself, although silent, was easy to follow. The screen was slightly granny and looked as if it was snowing, even indoors.
The story is about an anti-establishment group of just over half a dozen people, including one woman who is loved by two of the men, one of whom is the Chaney character. A member of the group had done something that angered the group and according to their procedure must be killed. The assassin is chosen by shuffling playing cards and giving each member a card until one gets the ace of hearts. This person is the assassin. One of the two men who loved the woman, not Chaney, got the ace of hearts. The woman marries him and does not want him to kill as he promised to do. The plot then focuses on whether he will carry out the assassination assignment. The woman gets Chaney to agree that if her husband does not carry out the assignment, he will save him from the group who will feel obligated according to their procedure to kill her husband.",1501804800,,1422,4.390151515151516

The movie begins with a group meeting of eight assassins (comprised of Lon Chaney as Farallone and John Bowers as Forrest) who are plotting a less than affable man's death. Lilith, who is the only woman character (which spells trouble already), comes into play soon after.  Farallone professes his love and devotion to her, asking for her hand in marriage.  He inquires, ""Have you ever thought of love?""  To which Lilith responds, ""No I have never thought of love. I only think of The Cause.""  (""The Cause"" being their profession as assassins.)  Needless to say, she refuses the proposal.

The idea of a revenge plot and a coldhearted female role (of the silent film variety at least) appeals to me highly.  But of course, being no stranger to silent film, my hopes for such an ongoing theme were low.

There is a second meeting for the purpose of finding who is going to do this man in.  Lilith is now present. Cards are dealt, and whoever receives the Ace of Hearts gains the title of executioner. Forrest becomes the lucky would-be assassin, after being dealt the coveted card. Forrest is honored and excited to be the one to put the death ""the man who had lived too long."" Instantly, Lilith falls madly in love with Forrest, saying she will marry him because, well, he was dealt that card.  The very same night they are married.  Waking up the next morning, Lilith, who just a day or two prior was only concerned with The Cause, is suddenly taken in with so much love that she tells Forrest, ""It seems so wrong to cause harm now that we have love.""  She becomes frantic, and pleads with him not to kill the man.

Long story short, The Ace Of Hearts is predictable and corny.  A seemingly promising plot was quickly dismantled by a moral love story.  What happens to Lon Chaney's character at the end is stupid.",1301702400,,1832,4.576687116564417
8309648,3,B001HUOUG2,"The plot was pretty straight forward: a ""secret society"" decides that ""an evil man"" must die. The movie was released in 1921, so the story idea lacked the sophistication, twists, and flashy graphics that we've gotten used to. Lon Chaney and the two other principal actors did their melodramatic best to carry the film. I give it 3 stars (out of 5), because the movie could've been better - but was entertaining, nontheless.",1280102400,,423,4.808219178082192
