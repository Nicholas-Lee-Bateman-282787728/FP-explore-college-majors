2015611,4,B0001LYESW,"Lapis is a princess and magical girl from Sorcerer Land who loves pudding and is a little immature and ditzy. She uses her magic eraser power once to often and destroys things. To teach her responsibility, her mother tries to send her on a short journey to a lake in the kingdom and accidently sends her much farther. the whole family is a little spacey. they send her teacher and a protector after Lapis. The 3 episodes are all about Lapis's return to her kingdom while a witch wants her for her pretty little sister collection and she helps the people she encounters. I think it's funny and I'm glad it was finally licenced. While it's only 3 episodes, they are long enough and unlike many OAVs there is a complete ending; you aren't left hanging. I do wish another OAV had been made or it had been made into a series. It's definitly worth a watch.",1087776000,6,850,4.420382165605096

8014675,3,B0001LYESW,I can't seem to view the final episode for some reason.  It freezes up whenever I make that far or just shortcut my way there.  Strangely frustrating considering that it was bought new....(?),1433894400,,191,4.757575757575758

8014679,4,B0001LYESW,"It has many of the textures and features of the far more famous and popular Slayers franchise, both in style and level of seriousness/silliness.

Its quite easily watchable with a nice plot and pleasant ending.",1366675200,,210,5.0
8014680,4,B0001LYESW,"This is another one for the series you wish they gave you more then three episodes. This is one of those fun anime series that grounded in comedy then reality. Princess Lapis causes a floating island in the sky to fall and it lands on the town just to save a bird. The princess gets kicked out of the castle by her mother. After realizing she sent her daughter to the wrong place, send a small group to aid her.

Princess Lapis travels back home, coming across a pudding forest that she can't stop eating and some fitness crazy brothers that force everyone to work out all day long. And if that was not enough, Topaz is hunting the princess down to add to her collection of pretty girls. They need to make some more episodes so we can see what happens.",1349481600,,752,4.295774647887324
8014681,5,B0001LYESW,"i really liked this cute little anime. the whole thing was super funny, and fun to watch, but it was so short, and dosent really have a proper ending. i really liked this but i wish it was longer. nonetheless it was a good show.",1223769600,,228,4.088888888888889

8014683,3,B0001LYESW,"Princess Lapis of Sorcerland is next in line for the throne but she doesn't really inspire confidence in her parents because of her immaturity. She has the powerful ability of the Magic Eraser, a power that negates whatever magic it is directed at. But she doesn't use it very wisely. At the beginning of the show she destroys an entire floating garden, bringing it crashing to the ground in order to save a baby bird that has fallen out of its nest. Then there's also her insatiable craving of pudding. So Lapis' mother decides to send her on a journey in order to improve her character. The problem is that instead of teleporting her to a site that is three days travel away, she sends her so far away that it will take her a month to get home! To help her on the journey, she sends Jii, Lapis' teacher of 15 years, Kohaku, the immortal warrior, and a small sprite that is her constant companion.

It's not going to be an easy walk back to the Diamond Palace. Lady Topaz, Witch of the North and Collector of Pretty Girls is out to get Lapis. Topaz makes Dr. Evil look competent. She wants to capture Lapis even though every time she gets involved with her, she ends up defeated. They will have to fight fearsome monsters, fight Lapis' appetite when they come upon a Pudding Forest, and must battle the Three Demons of Fitness who have enslaved an entire city to exercise against their will.

Detatoko Princess was funny. It's pretty much a satire of magic girl fantasies. Lapis is as dumb as a bag of nails and Topaz is her equal, in stupidity. Lapis seems more worried about her own skin that being noble. For instance, whenever there's a life-threatening situation she always throws Kohaku in harm's way. Just because he's immortal doesn't mean he doesn't feel pain! Jii's way of defeating monsters is showing them math drills. It's more adult-themed even though it says 13+. It does have a little nudity. It's just good-natured fun.

I would also recommend the 2 dvd set Magical Play.",1091232000,5,1989,4.565826330532213
