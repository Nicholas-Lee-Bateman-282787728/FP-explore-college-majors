Its quite different from Reach to alternate for some variety.  Reach is harder on your abs and butt, Center Floor is a bit faster paced, with more leg work and balancing work, more like dancing, with great side stretches.  So it helps to round out your workouts.  I tried about 10 different dvd workouts with disappointment before finding Reach happily :)  Hard enough to make a difference, but no cramping, no annoying high-energy marketing ploys, enough exercise changes to be interesting.  Center Floor continues the tradition and balances your week.  The choreography gets a bit fast and 'dancey' to catch on right away in places, but its something to get with time.

If you're a fan of Reach, you can see how some exercises were altered and makes it an interesting change.  The bright colored tops are nice to watch, the music is different enough from Reach to be interesting.",1327017600,17,1132,4.554455445544554
4511345,5,B00501LNP0,"I bought almost every Kari Anderson's dance workout DVD because I like her creative choreography combining ballet, pilates and yoga. This one leans more towards ballet movements, at least for the standing workout. I am not a dancer, but the movements are not hard to follow as Kari gives accurate and timely cues. The music is modern and upbeat, and it is a welcoming change from classical music that is usually used for ballet workout. The DVD targets almost every muscle group, and she does a great job in bringing new twist to old abs workout. Overall, I enjoy this DVD tremendously and I have set my goal to do this three times a week.",1310774400,19,639,4.565217391304348

8450608,5,B00501LNP0,"Love Kari, love this workout.  Precise, controlled, beautiful movements that build length, strength and flexibility.  This one some pretty good cardio moves boot.",1433980800,,162,6.0
8450609,5,B00501LNP0,One of my favorite workout DVDs.  Excellent except it doesn't include much work for the arms.  Excellent for hips - that's where you will feel it.  Excellent instructor - pleasant and obviously knows what she is doing.  This DVD is by FAR much better than any of  the others she has sold to date.  I have purchased them all and this is the only one I do approx. 1 time per week (along with Mari Winsor Pilates for lower body and Debbie Siebers excellent Slim in 6 (2nd level) and Mix it Up (awesome arm workout.),1404086400,6,512,4.28125
8450610,5,B00501LNP0,I have many of Kari's DVD's....ahhhhh I just love her classes and this is sooooooo great to be able to do a center barre workout....exactly what I was looking for.....thanks Kari.  A fabulous workout for the legs as well as core and posture....like the good old days in ballet class but can be followed easily by non dancers too.  When you are finished you really feel it in every muscle and the next day....have fun trying to walk:),1386892800,2,433,4.538461538461538
8450611,5,B00501LNP0,I recommend this video to all my clients. Kari has understaning of how to warm up the body and ease into exercise. She seamlessly builds from one 5 minutes workout to another.,1383609600,,175,4.5
8450612,3,B00501LNP0,"I like Kari Anderson a lot, but this one isn't a video I'll take out all the time. I did like that there was a little more movement than in REACH.",1374105600,,146,3.7419354838709675
8450613,5,B00501LNP0,"This is one of the best exercise videos I have ever done. The studio and color coordination are very bright and eye-pleasing , and the exercises are a nice flowing tempo. The music is motivating but not too loud. One of my favorite features is that the movie is broken up into five minute segments , so you can mix and match and do a different workout every day. It is very ballet-like and graceful and so much fun that you will forget how tired your muscles are getting!",1348444800,7,471,4.303370786516854
8450614,5,B00501LNP0,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas last year.  She has been using it regularly since then, as well as changing her diet.  She's lost 12 pounds and has noticed the development of firm, sculpted muscles in her calves and thighs.  The shape of her entire lower body has slimmed and toned, and she gained strength in her arms as well.

I'm planning on picking up a copy for myself.  Not an EASY routine, although suitable for beginners and very effective.  Some parts you have to work up to completing, but it does seem worth it.",1344384000,9,544,4.39
