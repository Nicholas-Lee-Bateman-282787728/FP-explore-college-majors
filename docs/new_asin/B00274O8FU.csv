8353892,5,B00274O8FU,"I saw the movie screened in Macon, GA--Carrie Preston's home town--and Carrie was there for Q&A after the movie. Her explanation was very helpful, as I hadn't had time to piece together everything together immediately upon the movie's ending. In fact, I'll have to wait for the DVD to come out (at the time of this writing, Amazon still hadn't released it) to watch it again before I can say I have it all figured out. It's one of those kind of movies, not for mass consumption. It's a great work of art. Great acting by all involved. Great story. When you watch it, take Carrie's advice to us: pay close attention, and give the movie time to develop. It's so cool to have a movie star there in person after a movie to discuss it. Wish that could happen more often! Thanks, Carrie!",1252713600,2,781,4.430555555555555
8353893,5,B00274O8FU,True independent film making at its best. Great story and a wonderful cast make this movie a true treat from the Hollywood norm. Kirt Gunn does a wonderful job with this being his first full length movie. You will laugh you will cry and will fall in love with the world he has created.,1251417600,3,285,4.296296296296297
