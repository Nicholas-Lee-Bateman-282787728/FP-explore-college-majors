The content (of the 2 DVDs I received) seems to be quite good, BUT the actual product itself is a con. The marketing material claims that it is a 5 DVD set (with each DVD having 2 episodes), thus imagine my surprise to only receive one DVD case (with 2 DVDs, each DVD having 2 episodes) rather than the 5 DVDs expected/advertised. Maybe mine was a 'unique' experience, but when I order a '5 DVD set' I expect 5 DVDs rather than 2.

If you do decide to order this '5 DVD set' it may be best to not use standard counting norms where 5 means 5, but rather a truncated version where 5 = 2.

Basically, I got conned (or I am the proud recipient of 3 invisible DVDs). In either case, unless you want to pay 100% full price for 40% product (or you can watch invisible DVDs), stay away from this product.",1311724800,4,823,4.229299363057325
8317350,5,B001L4L8RI,"I have been in a fight or three and practiced some martial arts - though not on the same level as the hosts - enough so that I can recognize a real fight when I see one. This is not one fight, its three or four per episode. It is two men fit and trained men absorbing as much of a martial art style as they can in 5 days. There is sparring, though some of the sparring is more beat downs than any sparring I have seen (Krav Maga I am looking at you), but there are real conflicts where two (or more) men test their mettle. It is the realness of the conflict that makes it so informative. Think an expert at Wing Chung expert can beat an expert at Karate? Watch both episodes and count the bruises on Doug - or his losses of consciousness. (Might make a good drinking game...)

However, this series is more than just a dialog between martial arts styles, it is a conversation in culture. Warrior status has often (always?) been held in an honored place in the world's culture. In this age however, it is often an aspect of our culture that is devalued and underrepresented. While our boys no ethnographers, the ever affable Jimmy and the slightly goofy Doug's insights into the other cultures as fellow warriors, provide a means of contrasting our warrior culture, as expressed by the hosts, and those of their instructors.

Lastly, beyond simply being informative and educational, it is entertaining. Jimmy and Doug are the kind of guys I want to have a beer with and listen to their relaying of events. They live in the world not on it, are respectful and observant, and seem determined to not experience the country's culture as tourists but as one who truly wants to understand their martial arts, their warrior culture, and context in which it exists - and accurately relay that point of view. If that isn't worth a tip o' the glass, little in this world is.

In short, if your a guy get it - its fun, informative, and you don't have to feel ashamed that you want to engage in some friendly brawling. Prove ol' Clint Eastwood wrong when he said ""We live in more of a p***y generation now..."". If you are girl - get it too, you'll understand more about the male side of our culture in the 40 or so minutes of this show than a Cosmo quiz will ever tell you.",1267401600,5,2259,4.348341232227488
8317351,3,B001L4L8RI,"FightQuest is a show that appeared on the Discovery Channel from late 2007 to early 2008.  This dvd set contains all 10 of the first season episodes.  The show seemed to be an answer from the Discovery Channel people to The History Channel's Human Weapon, which followed a very similar premise.  Since comparisons will be inevitable, I will first comment on this dvd set in particular and then comment on the show itself.

The Fight Quest dvd set came with 5 dvds, 2 episodes per disk.  There are no extras on the disks, and in fact there is no way to chapter surf through the episodes, so fast advancing will put you either right up to the next episode or to the end of the disk.  You can choose which episode per disk you want to view first.  The quality of the picture is no better than it was when the show aired on Discovery.  Also, I noticed in many episodes in which subtitles are used to clarify words used and locals' accents that the words are clipped on the left side of the screen.  It makes me think they needed to compress the episodes but did not.  I own a Panasonic HDTV 26"" that is less than 2 years old, so it should have been able to pick up any size picture (full screen or letter boxed) the disk creators wanted.  In general, I was not pleased with the quality of the shows on these disks and thought somebody did a quick job to get the set into production.  That is the reason for 3 stars, otherwise I would give this set a 5-star rating.

Now, to the show itself, which deserves at least 4 if not 5 stars.  In my opinion, this show is more entertaining than Human Weapon.  Although both shows are good and follow a similar format, the differences in Fight Quest are what make it better.  Both hosts in Fight Quest seem more natural on camera and less rehearsed, i.e., they seem more real.  Also, both hosts in Fight Quest must participate in competitive sparring by the end of each martial art exposure, whereas in Human Weapon the 2 hosts would choose which one would spar.  There is less explanation about the moves and the arts themselves with Fight Quest, which is something I liked better about Human Weapon. But the fighting is more intense and real with Fight Quest.  Also, partly because Fight Quest only had 10 episodes, there are some arts that are different or not displayed in this show than in Human Weapon.  For example, Fight Quest contains episodes focused on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Korean hapkido, which are not found in Human Weapon.  Both shows contain episodes on karate, French savate, Chinese kung fu, and Israeli krav maga.

Trivia: Jimmy Smith from Fight Quest beat Jason Chambers of Human Weapon in a mixed martial arts fight in California, on May 12, 2006 according to Chambers' entry on wikipedia.

Overall, I recommend watching Fight Quest if you are into martial arts or just a little interested, but this dvd set needs some professional touches and should have been released after they were added.",1228867200,20,2951,4.526415094339622
