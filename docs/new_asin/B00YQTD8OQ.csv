7229948,1,B00YQTD8OQ,"Hi, I am a movie. We are statues trying to act. Hi, I am movie, desperately trying to convince you this is art. The over controlling 'director' has demonstrated how to kill the light of the actors and the very space they breathe within.",1440201600,5,236,4.386363636363637
7229949,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"La Sapienza forms part of the University of Rome.
Beautiful! As they mention Corneille, one realizes that their formal, rhythmic language pays homage to the great master. Every thought stated has a tone of formalism simply because most of their thinking defines either life: ""her"", or art: him"". The teen agers are only their pupils.
There is also a lot of attention to the topic of love: passionate love, mother's love, love of beauty, and filial love (between the young ones).
Borromini's suicide is presented exactly as he wrote it prior to his death.
Wonderful, unusual film. And remember: at the end, everybody loves everybody. How lucky can you get?",1440115200,7,655,4.963636363636364

7229951,2,B00YQTD8OQ,"Chilly and antiseptic, La Sapienza could almost be a parody of a European art house film.  While the scenery is often breathtaking, it can't obscure the characters' lack of emotional credibility.  A viewer is given no reason to care about their fate.",1439510400,4,250,4.928571428571429
7229952,1,B00YQTD8OQ,"My God what a mess of a film. It must be harder to ask an actor to act this way than to actually find bad actors. The first 20 minutes are nothing short of shake your head awful. Someone likes architecture and decided there must be a film that can be made somewhere......unfortunately he never found that ""somewhere"" and in the process looses the film, the viewers and a directing career.",1439164800,4,388,4.47887323943662

8718814,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"This is the first film by Eug&egrave;ne Green I have seen. His style is indeed reminiscent of Bresson's, but it is much pleasanter, I think because he does allow his actors (""mod&egrave;les"" was what Bresson called them) to emote a little bit; they are not mere automata. Meanwhile, this cinema is (like Bresson's) very contemplative. We have ample time to observe a setting or a face, and LOTS of time to consider what a character says. How delightful, for once, not to be rushed from one poorly articulated and inadequately recorded mutter to the next, the two probably overlapping each other! (Overlapping dialogue is something I first noticed in Spielberg [""Close Encounters""], but Hitchcock experimented with it even earlier [in ""Shadow of a Doubt""]. It is now all too common.) For the English-speaker who knows some French and some Italian and enjoys these languages, it is especially delectable to have the lines delivered clearly and calmly, at an even rate, and with large silences in between them. Plus, too, this film is effective as: a) a love story, b) the story of an awakening, and c) a documentary on the art of Borromini.",1493510400,,1138,4.901554404145077

8718816,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"A gorgeous, human and poetic indictment of contemporary European secularism through the lens of architecture and history.",1472428800,3,121,6.176470588235294
8718817,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"A great thought provoking film about positive values, something that is far too rare in art today.",1471305600,2,98,4.823529411764706
8718818,3,B00YQTD8OQ,"A strangely filmed tale with acting that is heavily over-directed and over-acted.  The theme and scenes are lovely, but this is not an easy film to watch.  I certainly got the feeling that the director had forgotten his subtle pills on this one.",1465948800,,245,4.674418604651163
8718819,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"Beautiful photography of architecture and commentary on Borromini and Bernini.  Acting is stylized precisely to reflect the alienation and isolation of its characters.  I loved the name of the Architect's wife - Alienor - perfect for an alienist or psychoanalyst who correctly diagnoses and resolves problems, but can't herself reach the emotional level at the root of her own.  Even the ending carries overtones of despair overcome.",1457740800,,433,5.432835820895522
8718820,5,B00YQTD8OQ,It can stir the heart if you let it. Simple and beautiful.,1454371200,,58,3.9166666666666665
8718821,5,B00YQTD8OQ,"This is a beautiful film, beautifully acted by the two young people. The visits to Borromini's La Sapienza and San Carlo are an added enrichment.",1441929600,,145,4.84
8718822,1,B00YQTD8OQ,"When I read reviews of the film I was really eager to see it. I expected that the film would be less driven by narrative than any American film etc etc And bear in mind, I am someone who loves Antonioni films, Godard films, Fellini films... But this film is just horrible. I turned it off less than half way through. It is static and plodding and gets as bad as just rotating from talking head to talking head. Very disappointing.",1440633600,5,430,4.320987654320987
