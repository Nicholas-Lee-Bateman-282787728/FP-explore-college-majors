8037526,5,B00062L8VW,"For those who would like to consider themselves serious snowmobilers, this movie really does deliver. Monster flips and tricks all over the place, in fact they had so many they had to include an entire second DVD just for freestyle!

The Slednecks crew is well known to be one of the most extreme snowmobiling groups currently running, and they deliver the goods on this movie. While it takes your breath away with the huge jumps that these guys are pulling, there are also some funny moments as well that offer some relief from some of the footage. There is some very good footage filmed all over the United States, with a little more particular interest in Alaska, you will see them pulling massive air off of cornices, down through trees, and even watch them outrun an avalanche or two while it breaks away right underneath them.

If you are an enjoyer of these kind of flicks (and you really have to be, if you have never seen one before, borrow one from someone because they ARE rather expensive) then buy this movie, right now. If you've always wondered what your buddies thought was so great about those other snowmobile flicks, stray away. It doesn't do nor promise anything groundbreaking, there is just more and more over-the-top extreme good-ness that makes the Slednecks crew the top.",1097020800,,1296,4.7555555555555555
