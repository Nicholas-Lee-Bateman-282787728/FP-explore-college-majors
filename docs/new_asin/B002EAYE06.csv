3916638,4,B002EAYE06,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Somewhat old-fashioned and sentimental, yet still relevant today, because human nature does not really change. We still face tensions between the exigencies of our jobs and our private lives; between tradition and individualism.",1401235200,3,261,5.894736842105263
3916639,5,B002EAYE06,"One of the big movies of director Vidor. Young lives his life as he is supposed to-not as he chose to. He marries the
wrong woman, but is still in love with Lamarr. Lamarr is doing the same. Both are unhappy. In the end they...well, look
for yourself. Intellegent script about a missing love, disappointment and friendship. Excellent performance by Lamarr.
A real hidden treasure.",1398124800,9,380,4.861538461538461
3916640,5,B002EAYE06,"This movie is an excellent portrayal of how people view themselves and others around them as they grow and mature. Through the eyes of Robert Young, who is asked to write about what he has accomplished since college for an upcoming reunion, he reminises through flashbacks, whether or not his life has been of value, whether or not he is happy.  He reevaluates the people he has met throughout his life and the choices he has made. The most revealing age old fact  is that each generation views the next with the same sceptiscism, lack of understanding and sincere believe that the world will not survive. I loved this movie!",1391990400,7,625,4.672727272727273
3916641,5,B002EAYE06,"One of the very few stories based on a love affair that started early in manhood, went no where....and then
decades later, was accidentally reactivated after the man had a wonderful marriage.  He saw his first love
and even tho  she was still the same gal, he realized he was now and had been in love with the woman
he married.  So interesting and true to life.  Hedy Lamar was not only his first love, but actually in real
life, she was spy for British Intelligence in Germany during WWII.",1385596800,2,490,4.411111111111111

3916644,5,B002EAYE06,EXCELLENT MOVIE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING NOTHING OBJECTABLE A MUST SEE FOR ALL HEDY LAMAR IS A TREASURE A CLASSIC FILM IN ITS OWN RIGHT,1375056000,,130,4.695652173913044
3916645,5,B002EAYE06,This is a fascinating movie performance by Hedy Lamar.  Her performance is in many ways autobiographical.  I recommend Richard Rhodes' biography to those who would like to know more about Hedy.,1370563200,7,193,5.193548387096774
3916646,5,B002EAYE06,Robert Young gives a great performance as a rich young man who has a difficult time escaping his upbringing.  Hedy Lamarr is very good in a rare role that plays down her beauty as the city girl who doesn't want to give up what she had to fight to get as a woman in business.  There is a great supporting cast with Charles Coburn as Robert Young's father.  There are some very profound observations on life and what you expect of your children when they age.  It is a long film but keeps your interest along the way.  Similar in design to Citizen Kane as a retrosective of one's life but not nearly as cynical.  If you are a fan of Robert Young or Hedy Lamarr it is a must see.,1297468800,31,676,4.122137404580153
8367364,5,B002EAYE06,Good movie from the era. Another Hollywood production of a then current best-seller novel that is enjoyable.,1510012800,,108,5.411764705882353

8367367,2,B002EAYE06,"This movie just dragged on and on. I frankly can't see why anyone would want to squander two hours on something that is over the top predictable, slow and cumbersome. Hedy is gorgeous and Robert Young is as good as he can be against such a dreary storyline.",1470787200,2,257,4.375
8367368,5,B002EAYE06,"This has to be one of the most charming, endearing stories Ive ever encountered, both in film and book form.  On the surface, the fictional account of one, H. M. Pulham, Esq., aka, Harry Pulham, is of a man born with a sliver spoon in his mouth and all the advantages and social connections the rest of us dream about.  But beyond that there is a very human story of lost love, coming of age, accepting responsibility, and the rewards of being a nice guy.  Casting, set design, direction, and other production values are all of the highest order as detailed below, making H. M. Pulham, Esq. the most poignant, thoughtful tale this side of Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life.
  Like Capras masterpiece, H. M. Pulham, Esq. should be seen and re-seen so as not to miss many nuances that are shown or implied in the story.  As others have pointed out, it is narrated by Harry, in flashback form, much as was done with Citizen Kane.  But Harrys perceptions are not always true or complete as the viewer will find on a re-viewing.  Harry is just too decent a person to think ill of people, especially those close to him, and he doesnt see what the rest of us may see. For me, this just enriches the story and makes it all the more true to life.  Other reviewers have said that this movie is the best thing ever done by either Hedy Lamarr or Robert Young.  I have no basis to disagree.
  I always hated when my instructor in American literature would read into whatever he considered a master work of fiction all kinds of symbols and allegories that the author probably never intended.  It seemed so forced and contrived and I had no patience at all on the subject.  The problem for me now is that is exactly how Im feeling with H. M. Pulham, Esq. as I have watched and re-watched the film and have finished reading the book.
  At first, when I saw the movie, I was taken with how striking Hedy Lamarr looked and acted in her role as Marvin Myles.  She certainly seemed like the central figure in the story.  Moreover, I saw how Robert Young, never a Clark Gable or Tyrone Power-type of leading man, was the perfect foil for her as Harry Pulham.  How sad it seemed that he had to give up the love of his life so he might go about his daily routine and stuffy existence.  It seemed tragic that Harry couldn't have thrown over his blue blood life for gorgeous Marvin and moved back to New York where they could be part of the big things that were happening there.
  Also in the show, I saw how Van Heflin was the ideal choice for energetic Bill King and Charles Coburn was as Harrys detached but loving father.  Other characters seemed well chosen, as well, including beautiful Ruth Hussey as Harrys wife, Kay; Leif Erickson as the bombastic football hero, Bojo Brown; Harrys lively sister Mary, played by Bonita Granville; and the many other supporting actors and features, including the family dog, Bitsey.  As said above, set design and other production values are first-rate, as is the work of co-writer and director, King Vidor.  These things showed that the studio meant for H. M. Pulham, Esq. to be a BIG movie in 1941, and so should it be today.
  But then I began to see other sides to the story.  The scenes where Marvin Myles brushes Harrys hair or straightens his tie, or finds fault with his clothes or appearance in other ways contain a message.  His family and friends didn't seem right to Marvin, either.  She wanted Harry to aspire to bigger things.  In truth, if Harry had gone back to New York to be with Marvin he would have been totally dominated by her.  He would have lost his identity and simply become one of her possessions.  One or both of them would likely have turned to drink or had an affair with someone else and they would have ended up hating each other.
  At this point, I realized that Hedy Lamarr was not really the star of the show after all.  Marvin Miles was not the right gal for Harry and he knew it at the end.  The right one was the Kay Motford character played by Ruth Hussey, who had been married to Harry for over 20 years before the truth dawned on both of them.  Harry was meant to be just what he turned out to be and how he was trained in prep school and in his heroic feats in World War I.  He became head of the Pulham family when his father died and Harry had to become responsible.  He had no choice.  Then, Harry took his fathers advice and settled down with a woman who thought the way he did and shared his values.  And as with the Baileys in Its a Wonderful Life, all came right in the end.
  Aside from the storyline and character development one might see the dangers involved in being a compliant, or nice person when there are so many dominant, Type A, even selfish people around.  These include Bill King, Bojo Brown, and, yes, Marvin Miles.  Harry had to learn to stand up for himself, even with wife Kay, or he would have been bowled over.  Its fine to be cooperative and helpful, but when you forego your own interests too much you will suffer and others will take advantage and even hurt you whether they want to or not.
  To flesh out my feelings for this classic movie, I bought the book, by John Marquand, and have seen how generally faithful the film is to the novel.  Nevertheless, there are many more details, as one might expect, in the book.  These include Harrys awkward son George, more on Harrys sister Mary, and much more of the petty bickering between Harry and Kay.  Example: Kay accusing Harry of hating dogs when he complains about having to walk  Bitsey.  I would never have married you if I knew you hated dogs, says Kay.  Naturally Harry denies this and goes about walking Bitsey every morning and evening, just like clockwork.  Example #2: Kay tells Harry to stop saying, Of course, or All Right, dear, to everything.  He agrees to do so and then ten seconds later says, Of course.  In the book there is also the hint of a simmering affair between Kay and Bill that was not brought out in the movie; moreover, the book has Kay finding one of Marvins love letters to Harry from 20 years earlier which leads to a dramatic scene.  There are a few other differences in the movie vs. the book, especially at the end of the story but I shouldnt spoil it for others who have not seen or read either.  All in all, the book details make the characters come to life and tell their stories in a way that a 2-hour movie never could.  Having said this, my wife and I both found the movie ending to be better than what was in the book.  But I was so impressed by Mr. Marquands writing Ive bought five other novels by him.  If any are half as good as H. M. Pulham, Esq. Ill know I made a good investment.",1467417600,,6667,4.3525121555915725
8367369,5,B002EAYE06,"An extremely intelligent, immaculately well-written drama, with some ideas that go far deeper than the surface. It looks and feels like a conflict between romantic love and social background, but by the time it's over, it's much, much more. Are we all destined to have a love that is so perfect and so impossible that it is only ""wishing"" as Ruth Hussey says in the last scene? The casting in this movie is brilliant. Every character is absolutely believable, with the kind of nuances we're used to with real people.",1443571200,3,516,4.7444444444444445
