2551548,5,B000F4RH8E,"Superman the Animated series may have only lasted 54 episodes, but these last 18 are a Dc junky's dream come true.  I'd never gotten to watch the show very much when I was a kid, and man did I miss out?!  These last 18 eps are the most dramatic, from what I read on the various episode guides.  Finally, Superman and Darkseid face off in three of the best two part episodes Bruce Tim and company ever created for the DC AU.  That's the best reason I can think of for purchusing this set.  We get to see Superman take on his deadliest foe, Darkseid!  And we don't just get to see one fight between the two, but a whole heck of a lot more!  June 20th can't get here fast enough!",1145059200,4,676,4.075757575757576

2551550,5,B000F4RH8E,"Ok, people, this is it: The final Superman The animated series Volumen. Containing the most exciting and non expected events from the whole series, this is the set that fans were waiting for since day 1. Lots of guest heores, amazing team ups, awesome fights and lots of unexpected changes. Dont doubt for a second in gettig this set. This is THE set from the whole series. Kyle Rayner, Aquaman, Batman, Robin, Legion of Superheroes, all are here. Wanted to see how everything was pre-Justice League? Wanna know why Superman was so weak in the first season of Justice League? Wanna know how Superman met Aquaman? Its all here. Get this now, you won't regret it! This is Superman vs Darkseid!",1143590400,11,691,4.7190082644628095
2551551,5,B000F4RH8E,"This is the last volume of Superman: The Animated Series, and includes the last 18 episodes of the show's 54-episode run. It's scheduled to release alongside a slew of Superman-related shows and movie tie-ins, including Justice League season 2 and a new direct-to-video movie featuring Brainiac. This is also the set fans have been waiting for.

Roughly speaking, volume 3 can be divided into thirds. The first third of the set are your typical self-contained Superman stories. We get the introduction of Maxima the warrior queen and Volcana (Peri Gilpin of Frasier). Toyman, Mxy, Bizzaro, and Jax-Ur and Mala return. There is an odd episode involving an alien menace in Smallville, and a dud spotlighting Jimmy Olsen.

The next third are team-up episodes. Superman meets Aquaman and Green Lantern (the Kyle Rayner version) for the first time, and teams up with Batman again to fight Ra's Al Ghul. The Legion of Superheroes help young Clark Kent fight Brainiac in Smallville, and Robin also helps Superman masquarade as Batman when Bruce Wayne goes missing. These are all fun adventures. They predate the Justice League series, and its fun to see the DC animated universe slowly expand into what we know today.

It's the final third of this volume though, that will get fans pumped. These form the Darkseid saga, and are three two-part episodes. Besides the formal introduction of Supergirl, these episodes contain some of the most dramatic and shocking moments in the 10 years+ of shows that Timm and co. have created. This is Superman's darkest hour, and the series finale ""Legacy"" ended things on a very bittersweet note, the effects of which carried over strongly into JLU. Powerful stuff.

Like I said, there's so much Superman-related stuff coming out June 20th to tie into the movie. You'll probably have to make choices about what to buy and what to pass over. Don't let STAS: Volume 3 be passed over.",1143417600,102,1909,4.95625

2551691,4,B000F4RH8E,"Though this season is only 13 episodes vs last season's 28, it still packs a punch. It's also worth noting that of the three seasons, this is darkest. Well by 90's Superman standards. (Spoilers ahead.)
From the conspiracy laden ""Where's There's Smoke"" episode, the cult-like and dangers of what a cult can cause (albeit with a sci-fi twist) in ""Unity"", the oppression world that returning characters Jax-Ur and Mala rule in ""Absolute Power"", the brooding of Aquaman at the end of the episode ""A Fish Story"" (seriously love how that one ended.), to the last two episodes ""Legacy 1 and 2"" where we see what Superman would be like if controlled by Darkseid to him beating Supergirl, to seeing how the world counters a Superman threat, the list goes on.
It also has cameos and crossovers galore including Superman disguised as Batman and in Gotham in ""Knight Time"" (It was a sight seeing Bane go one on one with ""Super-Batman""), a few appearances of Supergirl in Unity, Legacy 1 & 2, Legion of Superheroes in ""New Kids In Town"", Aquaman in ""A Fish Story "", Ra's Al Ghul in the ""Demon Reborn"" and my personal favorite of the cameos, Kyle Rayner's Green Lantern (by far the most relatable, likeable, and most charismatic of the Green Lantern's presented to the audience in the animated universe.) in ""In Brightest Day?"".
There are a few duds in here like ""Obsession"" and ""Superman's Pal"", but they're so few, it's barely noticeable.
I can't give it a 5 star, mainly because it was cut too short, but it's definitely a solid 4-star season.",1445558400,,1532,4.720149253731344

All the other Superman cartoons pale in comparison to this version...only the Max Fleischer version can compare with this version..it is that cool. I will admit that the animation style of the show is very unique, but the storylines of each show are very adult themed, but not in a bad way...the storylines are powerful and dramatic and at times very emotional. Superman is shown as a hero out to do good and is willing to lay down his life for everyone even Lex Luthor. Superman is a true hero...his powers are scaled back a bit to make each of his battles harder for him to win, but he shows his compassion throughout each story. This is a true masterpiece of a show.

2551775,5,B000F4RH8E,"I wasn't very impressed with the first two volumes of Superman TAS, the team that brought us the brilliant Batman TAS just couldn't seem to get a handle on Superman.  But with this third and final volume they finally seem to hit their stride.  It also showcased the heights they would reach with the Justice League series that followed.

The stakes are higher, there are more guest stars and cross overs and it ends with a spectacularly ambitious 2 part finale.

While there's one or two misses in here, it's a great overall product.  It includes a few episodes from Season 2 and all of Season 3 on 2 disks (one double-sided).

To start off we get a full scale invasion of Earth by Darkseid in the two-parter ""Apokolips...Now!' followed by the triumphant return of Supergirl in 'Little Girl Lost'.

Then there's two crossovers with Batman.  In Knight Time Superman must pose as Batman while the Dark Knight is missing.  Then later in the Demon Reborn pits them both against Ras al'Ghul.  The Legion of Super-Heroes pops up for New Kids in Town and there are somewhat lesser episodes introducing Green Lantern and Aquaman.

The finally things go very, very dark with the 2-parter 'Legacy' where a brainwashed Superman leads Darkseid's invasion of Earth.  Supergirl, Lois Lane and several other characters pitch in for a worthy final episode.

Finishing this I was hungry for more, I finally felt that the producers had all their pieces in place.

But instead of continuing with Superman they doubled down with the Justice League!

If you're on the fence about whether or not to watch Superman TAS I would start here, this is as good as it got.  If you like this then go back for the other two volumes.",1426291200,,1700,4.6925675675675675

My only gripe is that the packaging is not consistent with the other 2 volumes. This upsets me. It makes me think Superman got the bum wrap with some new designer not paying attention to detail. I may be the only one who cares but the Batman Volumes all match and are consistant with their numbering and symbol set up.

The first two volumes of Superman The Animated series had the volume numbers fully spelled out but in volume three it was just a number 3. There is also the missing 'S' symbol on the back of the cover. It is the only faults of this release.

For collectors this is an annoyance.",1424995200,,866,4.2303030303030305

Earth's military power most of the time is shown to pretty much be the greatest military power in the universe with a huge assortment of advanced weaponry, armored powersuits and the commitment, skill and willingness to use them.

But out of a misguided desire to always have Superman (Or Lex Luthor) save the day rather then just help save the day, this is always glossed over. The first time its glossed over and the world got conquered it was so absurd as to be laughable if not so sad. Though they made up for it quite a bit with the episodes apacalips.

One episode would show Supes lifting at least a million pounds and in the next episode he couldn't even fly a crane that fell off the building out of the way. In one episode a high voltage attack would leave him helpless but in another episode Darkseid hit him with the Omega Beam and he almost defeated it.  I remember in the Super Friends series from the 70's, they would show the heroes cleaning up messes they made from battling the bad guy's. In this series they don't do that.

Of the recurring villains, I think Mxyzptlk was my favorite. Superman's tricks to get him back into the Fifth Dimension were different from what I remember in the comics.

These are really good episodes, which push Superman's boyscout routine to the limit.

The Green Lantern chosen for this episode is Kyle Rainer, who, surprisingly, works for the Daily Planet as an illustrator. His friendship with Jimmy Olsen is based on the mutual frustration the two share over their work being unappreciated. We get a first taste of Kyle's heroism when he stops a crook from running off with Jimmy's camera. To make a long story short, a Green Lantern named Abin Sur dies, the ring-and Sinestro-find Kyle and Superman must intervene to help his friend find his place in the Green Lantern Corps.

2551930,4,B000F4RH8E,"""Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 3"" has some of the best and worst episodes of the series. The first disc has nothing but great episodes on it. First we have ""Warrior Queen"". A great comical episode about a warrior queen from another planet who falls in love with the Man of Steel, and she won't take no for an answer when Superman rejects her. A laugh out loud episode with some great action in it too. Then we have the two-part ""Apokolips...Now!"" which I think is still one of the greatest episodes of all time. Darkseid launches an all-out attack on Earth, and even Superman is powerless to stop him. It is the most action-packed and emotional story of them all. It also has the very best ending out of all the episodes as well. Then we have the two-part ""Little Girl Lost"" which is another classic episode that introduces Supergirl. Next up is ""Where There's Smoke"" which isn't one of my favorite episodes, but it's still enjoyable and has a good mystery in it. It's actually more of a Batman type episode. Although Batman does not appear in it, the story itself is more like what you would see for a Batman episode. There's even a part in it where Superman roughs a guy up a little in order to get information out of him.

Then for side A of disc 2 we have some great and terrible episodes. First we have ""Knight Time"" which is a great episode where Superman joins forces with Robin in order to find Batman who has mysteriously disappeared. This episode has a lot of comical moments in it, a lot of mystery, and a lot of action too. Plus you have some Batman villains as well. Then comes ""New Kids in Town"" which is another great episode where Brainiac travels back in time to Smallville to kill a young Clark Kent before he became Superman and it's up to three Legionnaire superheroes to stop him. Then we have ""Obsession"" which I think is a terrible episode. But then again this one does have the Toyman in it, and I never really did like the Toyman. I'm surprised I liked his premiere episode ""Fun and Games"" from Volume 1. Then we have ""Little Big Head Man"" which was a real disappointment. In it we have Mxyzptlk and Bizarro joining forces, but it aint anything like the pervious Bizarro and Mxyzptlk episodes. It aint funny, just annoying. Then we have ""Absolute Power"" which did have a good story and some impressive animation in it, but the script was just too out there. Like when Superman saves a spaceship from a Black Hole. This is the same man who had problems landing a plane in the pilot episode, and yet he can withstand the G-Forces of a Black Hole! Give me a break! But the story was still good. Maybe not one of my favorite episodes, but it's not the worst either. Then we have ""In Brightest Day..."" in which Superman must join forces with the Green Lantern. I found this episode to be highly enjoyable.

As for side B of disc 2... we have ""Superman's Pal"", and I don't care what anybody says, this episode was a great episode. It has a great story, lots of mystery, lots of comedy, and lots of action. Plus we really do get to see some nice charater moments in it between Superman and Jimmy. Then we have ""A Fish Story"" in which Superman meets Aquaman, and the two must combine forces against Lex Luthor who threatens millions of innocent people from Aquaman's home - Atlantis. A great action-packed episode with a good story. Plus I really love Lois' charater in this one too as we see her dodging bullets and out running the bad guys on a motor bike. I just loved that part. A great episode if you ask me. Then we have ""Unity"" which was a great alien invasion story that has Supergirl in it. Kind of a scary one too. Another great episode in my books. Then we have ""The Demon Reborn"" in which Superman and Batman once again join forces. This time they're battling the immortal Ra's Al Ghul, one of my all time favorite Batman villains. A fine Superman/Batman crossover episode. Then last, but not least, we have the two-part series' finale ""Legacy"". This might come as a shock to many people, but this is the one episode that caused me to give this review four stars instead of five. It has a great story in it, and a lot of action, but the end completely ruined it for me. In this one Darkseid brainwashes Superman into attacking Earth. After Superman recovers from his brainwashing, he, and Supergirl who had nothing to do with the attack and actually fought against Superman, are imprisioned by the U.S. government and sentenced to death. Thanks to Lois, Superman and Supergirl manage to escape. Superman has his final battle with Darkseid, but returns to Earth hated and feared by everyone. A terrible ending for an episode itself, and especially a series. A great series with a terrible ending.

In all, although ""Legacy"" was a terrible episode, this volume still had some of the best episodes in the series, and it would be a shame for any Superman fan to go without.

Not quite as consistently good as the various incarnations of Batman by these producers, I would argue that Superman's best episodes (mostly contained in this set) match the highs of their work on the Dark Knight.

2551935,4,B000F4RH8E,"I watched the animated BATMAN with my daughter when she was a small child, when it was coming out for the first time.  I recently watched the Justice League cartoons that were done by largely the same people.  I should have watched SUPERMAN before watching JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, and so should you if you haven't seen them all yet.  SUPERMAN, like BATMAN, is not at all a bad show.  It is, in fact, a very decent one.  The problem is that the Justice League shows are extraordinary and they make all of the others look weak in comparison.  On the other hand, watching SUPERMAN after JUSTICE LEAGUE really brings how brilliant the latter truly was and how much both the writing and the animation techniques improved as they worked on it.

Still, SUPERMAN is all in all a pretty decent cartoon series.  While the writing isn't nearly as strong or as innovative as the writing on JUSTICE LEAGUE would be, it was still quite above normal for children's programming and the voice talent, like all of the DC cartoon shows, is top notch.  It is all quite watchable, but I never, ever got the sense that I was watching something remarkable as I did with JL.

I also did not care much for the general ""dumbbing down"" of the DC stories.  And some of the revisions of traditional DC storylines were unnecessary and arbitrary.  For instance, they do a Green Lantern origins episode in Season Three, several traditional elements are changed.  Abin Sur is shown as having been pursued by Sinestro, whereas in most origins stories Abin Sur is deeply upset at the death of his colleague.  And Sinestro is shown already a fully blown bad guy upon the selection of the earthling Green Lantern for Section 2814.  The successor of Abin Sur is in this version Kyle Raynor, while there is a bizarre nod to the original Green Lantern, Hal Jordan in the episode.  Why Kyle Raynor instead of Hal Jordan?  Perhaps because Jordan's back story as a test pilot is too well established, while it was easier to work with Raynor?  It was all just odd and I'm confused at nearly all of the narrative choices in this particular episode.  But the same kind of oddness afflicts several episodes.  Not to beat too often on the same drum, but these kinds of changes were much better handled in the later JL series.

I don't recommend skipping this episode, but I definitely recommend watching the three DC series in the order that they were made, BATMAN, then SUPERMAN, and then JUSTICE LEAGUE.  While the first two series are of a similar quality, the third grew into something truly special.",1249603200,,2577,4.642384105960265

2551937,3,B000F4RH8E,"I've liked Superman ever since Doomsday walked into the scene. I loved the Batman cartoons as a kid, but never saw the Superman episodes. Since I knew they were done by the same team, I decided to give them a try. My final reaction after watching all 3 seasons: it was okay. I'd give it three and a half if I could, but oh well.
DC could have done things much better with Superman. Some of the voices of the villains were downright annoying, particularly Livewire and Volcana. The animation is at least a step down from the Batman series, at one point toward the end of this season I thought I was watching an old Scooby Doo episode (Superman's Pal). And I hated the way the show ended. The episodes were good, yes, but it made earth and us humans look like a bunch of racist, small-minded goombas.
Superman's weaknesses get VERY old. No kidding, Superman gets electocuted in 8 straight episodes. The writers got so tired of thinking of ways to hurt him, they just started shocking the heck out of him and playing the same sound byte over and over again. I almost got to the point during all this where I gave up on the show. Superman shows no will or grit like Batman does. He comes across as a wuss. He hardly ever uses his super-speed, he hardly ever uses his heat vision or super breath, it's pathetic how these writers just couldn't come up with better storylines to give him full use of his powers. He gets baled out time after time, and you'll start to wonder, is Superman even that strong? But then he'll go and stop a space ship from getting sucked into a black hole or saving a giant airplane from crashing. It's VERY inconsistent with his powers.
It was very disappointing that the writers never gave a full season to the Doomsday arc, instead they passed the story off to a lame-brained, crappy plotted movie that I don't recommend. After seeing Spider-man do full season arcs, DC should have taken a leaf from them. Many missed opportunites in this show.
Funny as it is, the best episodes are the ones that bring in Batman. They do a wonderful job with the Superman/Batman relationship. The episode where Supes dons the cowl is hands down the best of the whole series.

""I know, Clark. They draw me like a stick insect midget. You look like the Hulk by comparison.""

The only other disappointment in this series is that kryptonite needn't exist. Just about everything else affects Superman to some extent as well. In a commentary in Vol 1 or 2, the producer said, ""you got no show, if you don't do that."" (Superfriends writers Hanna-Barbera got half hour stories out of a fully invulnerable Supes).

BUT APART FROM THAT, IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT SHOW.

This set may confuse collectors who didn't buy vol 2. The DVD set releases are not grouped as seasons 1-3.

Vol 1 gives you the shorter season 1 and the first few episodes of Season 2.

Vol 2 gives you most of season 2.

Vol 3 (this one) gives you the last few eps of season 2 and the whole of season 3.

I particularly enjoyed the premier appearances of other DC characters not on tv before. Rather than take a chance on giving them their own shows, Warner came up with a brainstorm. Almost every second episode of Superman in this DVD set teams Superman up (in the comic book style of DC Comics Presents...) with another Super Hero, including 2 more Batman appearances (one with Tim Drake Robin), the New Gods, Aquaman (drawn much better than his half naked long haired nose ringed appearance in Justice League), Legion of Super Heroes, and the first tv appearance of the Kyle Rayner Green Lantern (all but ignoring Hal Jordan, but it's good to see Kyle).

The Legion story is set in Clark Kent's college years, before he became Superman, and adapts the premise for Legion of Super Heroes: They go into the past from the 30th Century to young Clark's time, and team with him. A great prototype for the Legion series that aired last year.

Also, if you're wondering what happened to Batman's enemies Ras Al Gul and Bane in his own series, you'll get your answers here in two team-ups with Superman. ""Knight Time"" adapts the long running Knightfall Batman plotline of the early 1990s, using Superman as Batman's stand-in, rather than Jean-Paul. ""Demon Reborn"" pits Ras against Superman and Batman, whose Worlds Finest relationship is developing at just the right pace to continue in Justice League season one.

Buy this one for sure,

I specifically bought the Third and Final Season because it was the best, and I only wanted to view 6 episodes:
1) Knight Time
2)  Legacy part 1 & 2
3)  In Brightest Day
4)  Apokolips Now Part 1 & 2
5)  the 2nd Batman crossover (sorry forgot the title episode)
6)  absolute Power

I love the crossovers of heroes or anything, and especially Batman.  I liked the Kyle Rayner Green Lantern version better than the one in Justice League. Mainly because the one in JL is dumb and weak.
I never really liked Superman as a Hero or character, here I am in the same opinion as Batman: Superpowers=super stupid.  The solution to near-invincible characters like Superman (or Dragonball characters) is to invent even more ridiculous villains with better powers. Superman's other weakness is that he bashes everything to bits, and almost never uses his head (er, sorry for the hyperbole); and his willpower/spirit are incredibly weak.
I guess I never identified Superman as a ""part of me"".  The only time he uses his brains is when Bruce Wayne went missing in Knight Time. It was fun to see Supes live a day in Batman's shoes; and to add to the Dark Knight's legacy when he beat Bane into submission.  Though, that episode dumbed down Bruce Wayne to make Supes look incredible, which is fine.  Though, I doubt Batman would ever be controlled in this fashion in his own series and in the comics!
I wanted to see Darkseid humiliate and beat Superman, yeah, I don't like guys like Supes.
Evil Kryptonians, Jaxur and Mala, they're, of course, always cool.

And, Lois Lane is a superb character, much better than the original movies.

Also, his villains really are terrible ideas.
Livewire--all she has is electricity, big deal.  And Lori Petty has an annoying voice, I never did like her.
Toy Man--this is the creator's sub-par effort in creating a semi-sympathetic villain.
Mxyzpltk--he's pathetic and not funny, he's only Iago with magic powers and Q-like background.  I also don't like Gilbert Gottfried with his unique voice, and I know he acted Iago in Aladdin too.

Also I didn't like Superman's inconstancies:

1) one episode he can fly in space, the next he needs a full suit?  I was hoping the creators did something about this and stray from the comic books.

A plot loophole in the series to consider:  After watching Apokolips part 1 and Legacy part 1 again....I found some things mysterious.
1) What happened to New Genesis' alliance with Earth?  Orrion, son of Darkseid storyline seemed to vanish completely for Legacy part 1 & 2.
2)  Shouldn't all of Earth remember their battle with Darkseid?  I mean, he trashed Metropolis, Inspector Dan Turpin died....yet, in the episode Legacy 1 &2 the military and the rest of the citizens of earth conveniently 'forgot' those events.  They should really believe Superman's story of being controlled.  There, after all, was a video conference live with Darkseid demanding their surrender.....<shrugs>.

it's things like this that, that make me love the Batman animated series much more.  There were very little loop holes.

Other minor complaints: the artwork is not as crisp and sharp as Batman's world was.  It looked more like a cartoon from the old Hanna Barbara days.
The packaging is awful.  I wish they marked ""Side A"" and ""Side B"" more clearly, or used a third DVD, and it was difficult to get out of the box.

Fun adventure, only if you enjoy mindless bashing of Superman.",1163635200,3,3523,4.792703150912106
2551946,5,B000F4RH8E,"This third volume of Superman -The Animated Series is really a tribute to the late, great Jack Kirby. Darkseid is introduced with some of the other New Gods that Jack had created. This is because the animators of the series, like Bruce Timm were fans of Kirby's and were inspired and influenced by Jack. You won't be disappointed as a fan of the Superman series either.

2551951,1,B000F4RH8E,"I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.

The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series.",1155254400,5,1261,4.396551724137931

I agree the third season of this series was the best and it was ended way too early just as Gargoyles, Batman Beyond, Batman, Spiderman and all the great late 1990's cartoon series' were ended too early.

He has come to grips with his alter-persona and he IS what he IS.  The directors, artists, writers, and voice actors of this series were always spot-on.

2551955,5,B000F4RH8E,"In this volume, it features the four eppys that made me a Superman: TAS fan for life! I'll point them out later! Right now, let's get to the volume:

Disc 1

Warrior Queen - A spoiled but skilled fighter from another world comes to Earth to challenge Superman and make him her husband! Ending is rather comical!

Apokolips...Now!, Pt. 1 - Darkseid makes his first push towards domination of Earth and its up to Superman, Orion and policeman Dan Turpin to stop him!

BIG NOTE HERE! THERE IS HIDDEN ALTERNATE COMMENTARY ON THIS EPISODE! HARD TO FIND BUT WORTH THE LISTEN!

Apokolips...Now!, Pt. 2 - A war rages in the streets of Metropolis! Superman and his side triumphs but pays a big price as one of his closest allies dies! Very shocking for a Saturday morning show!

Little Girl Lost, Pt. 1 & 2 - In this two parter, we are re-introduced to Kara, better known as Supergirl! As she goes through the growing pains of adjusting to Earth, Granny (one of Darkseid's flunkies) makes a bid to take down the Man Of Steel but doesn't count on Superman's pesky cousin to get involved!

Where There's Smoke - Volcana, a telekenetic with the power to manipulate fire, wants revenge on the government agents that imprisoned her!

Bonus Features:

Commentary on Apokolips...Now!, Pt.  2 by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, glen Murakami, Dan Riba and James Tucker.

Superman: Behind The Cape - David Kaufman (the voice of Jimmy Olsen) takes you behind the scenes with the show's creative team.

Disc 2/Side A

Knight Time - When Batman goes missing, Superman shows up in Gotham City to team with Robin (Tim Drake).........as BATMAN! Rather comical but slightly scary episode!

New Kids In Town - The Legion Of Super Heroes, a group from the future, goes back in time to stop Braniac from murdering a young Clark Kent!

Obsession - Toyman returns and stalks a famous model but all isn't what it seems as the model is one of his creations!

PERSONAL NOTE: My knock here is that I wished WB would've put the Static Shock episode where Superman shows up because its actually a follow up to this particular episode! Would've made a good bonus feature but I digress!

Little Big Head - Myzlyklik returns and riles up Bizzaro into a rampage on Metropolis.

Absolute Power - While studying a black hole, Superman discovers a new Krypton that is ruled by the two criminals that he imprisioned into the Phantom Zone in ""Blast From The Past.""

In Brightest Day - Kyle Rayner, an artist, is given the legendary power of The Green Lantern with Senestro hot on his heels!

Disc 2/Side B

Superman's Pal - Jimmy Olsen experiences new celebrity as a friend of Superman's! This ends up working against him as Metallo returns to use him in a new plot against The Man Of Steel.

Fish Story - Aquaman makes his first appearance in his more classic outfit as he takes on Lex Luthor with aid from Superman and Lois Lane!

Unity - Superman teams with Supergirl when an alien takes over Smallville and mentally warps them including Johnathan and Martha Kent!

The Demon Reborn - Batman returns to Metropolis to find Ras Al Gul and discovers a plot involving Superman! We also see a tense moment between Bats and Lois Lane, keeping with the continum from ""World's Finest.""

Legacy, Pt. 1 & 2 - Superman goes on a rampage as Lex Luthor manipulates a rather paranoid general to kill him. However, there is more to this than meets the eye and when all is said and done, Superman will regain his goodness but will nearly lose it all in his showdown with Darkseid.

Bonus Features:

Commentary on New Kids In Town by Bruce Timm, Glen Murakami, Dan Riba, Butch Lukic and James Tucker.

Look, Up In The Sky! The Amazing Story Of Superman - Excerpts from the new documentary. Produced by Bryan Singer & Kevin Burns. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY THE WAY BY THIS REVIEWER!

Commentary on Legacy, Pt. 2 by Bruce Timm, Glen Murakami, Dan Riba, Paul Dini and James Tucker!

Excellent end to the Superman series! The episodes that turned me to this show was Apokolips...Now! and Legacy! Very excellent story telling!

As I said earlier, I would've liked to have seen the Static Shock eppy where Superman appears and helps him fight Toyman and the rogue female robot from ""Obsession"" as a bonus feature but other than that, great buy!",1153612800,3,4266,4.640479360852197
2551956,5,B000F4RH8E,"Those who enjoyed Volumes 1 and 2 of Superman: The Animated Series will be blown away by Volume 3, which definitely features the best set of episodes to this brilliant series.  This is primarily because of 7 specific episodes, six of which make up the enthralling Darkseid saga and the seventh episode being the clever Knight Time, the one where Superman travels to Gotham City and fills in for a missing Batman.  The premise is certainly a gimmick, but the writers make the plot seem fresh and frequently hilarious, and it's easy to see why this episode has become a fan-favorite.

The highlight of this volume is the Darkseid saga, which is comprised of 3 two-part episodes, all combining for one epic story arc, beginning with the aptly titled Apokolips...Now!, which directly continues to Little Girl Lost, and eventually climaxes with the series finale Legacy.

The first 1/3 of this story arc, Apokolips...Now!, gives us the intriguing backstory to the warring planets of Apokolips and New Genesis.  This serves as a build-up to Darkseid's invasion of Earth, which is easily one of the most grand-scale and exciting battle scenes I've seen (be it live-action or animated).  The imagery in this episode is truly unforgettable, whether it's the sight of Superman drilling holes in and out of the Earth's surface or swarms of parademons turning Metropolis into an all-out war zone, Apokolips...Now! boasts no shortage of visceral or visual thrills.

The next segement, Little Girl Lost, is most notable for the introduction of Supergirl, whose cute face, adorable voice, and infectious sense of fun make her one of the most likeable and winning characters in the DC animated universe.  The episode also finally takes the action to Apokolips, where both Supergirl and Superman battle it out with Darkseid's minions, resulting in plenty of epic and exciting action sequences.  Since LGL comes directly after Apokolips...Now!, you're likely to need a breather after these four episodes.

Thus, the final encounter with Darkseid is saved for the series finale, the two-part Legacy, which is just as powerful and thrilling as Apokolips...Now! and Little Girl Lost.  I hesitate to give away the plot twists, suffice to say the last ten minutes feature a truly vengeful Superman, who battles his way through Darkseid's army until he reaches the throne room, where he goes mano-a-mano with the ruler of Apokolips himself.  The ensuing fight between the two foes is nothing short of spectacular, and its resolution is tinged with bitter irony.

Undoubtedly, I've been gushing quite a bit over these seven episodes.  But this volume also boasts other highlights, including the first appearance of Aquaman and the return of Jax-Ur and Mala (this episode boasts a terrific fight scene set outside the edge of a black hole).  As usual, the animation and voice acting is superb, particularly Tim Daly as Clark Kent/Superman, who would be missed since George Newbern took over the role in Justice League. Most definitely, Newbern doesn't have a patch on Daly. All in all, a great volume that should definitely be seen by any Superman fan or for anyone who enjoys epic sci-fi action.",1153008000,,3170,5.057581573896353
2551957,5,B000F4RH8E,"The third and final volume of Superman: The Animated Series has hit the shelves and it arrives with no shortage of excellent episodes and great special features. Included in this volume are fan favorites ""Apokolips...Now!"", ""Knight Time"", ""Legacy"" and ""Superman's Pal."" (Just kidding on that last one, but not as bad as some make it out to be).

While the set opens with a mediocre episode (""Warrior Queen"") and certainly contains some of the worst animated Superman outings (aforementioned ""Superman's Pal"" and some would consider ""Unity"" poor as well), this is by far my favorite volume of the trio. ""Apokolips...Now!"" and ""Legacy"" are gems to be sure, but my favorite is still ""Knight Time."" Seeing this episode as a kid was just a real treat; seeing Superman act like Batman is great... I mean sure it's a simple story, but it is just a ton of fun to watch.

The packaging of this volume varies slightly from the previous sets. Instead of a whole fold out digi-pak setup, we get a similar set up as Justice League has been given. Two trays are still present (one for each disc), but the casing is slightly smaller (only by a few centimeters) than the previous sets. A beautiful shot of Superman soaring over Metropolis is the backdrop behind the two discs and it looks really, really nice.

 Moving to the special features, we get an excellent comic shop roundtable hosted by David Kaufman (voice of Jimmy Olsen) on the first disc. ""Superman: Behind the Cape"" delves into the shows third season and even tackles some very fanboy sounding questions (""Favorite episodes?""), but for the most part the featurette is solid. The naming of poor episodes in this DVD set also surprised me, as I've noticed the crew generally shies away from calling anything ""bad""--but ""Superman's Pal"" certainly got smacked in this round.

The remaining special features are four commentaries. I know what you're thinking and yes, the menus only show three. The fourth commentary is an easter egg on the first disc and was certainly a great surprise to me when I found it. Originally solicited as a deleted scene, this commentary really came out of nowhere. I'll leave the identity of the episode a mystery and let everyone hear it for themselves (though you may want to save it until you've listened to the other three, as it was recorded last).

Despite the lack of Jason Hillhouse on the set (hey, I've grown accustomed to the guy showing up!), it was still all extremely entertaining. Between the great episodes and the poor ones, this set packs it all in a nice slipcase.",1152576000,2,2556,4.784580498866213
2551958,5,B000F4RH8E,"In the last season Darkside makes a final stand against the Man of Steel.  This episode proves that there should be a series of Jack Kirby's New Gods in animated form.  We get to see many of the old DC favorites in action.  This season builds to follow the events we see in the Justice League.  I only wish that this show could have lasted longer.  At least there is an animated film to accompany the new feature film by Brian Singer.  Don't miss this last season.  It makes the whole series worth watching again.  Like many of my favorites, this series is worth repeated viewings.",1151625600,3,581,4.415094339622642

Well with it comes a great addition: the third and last volume in the Superman Animated Series set which features some great episodes including some teamups and an all-and-out brawl with Apokolips and Darkseid.

Disc I:

Warrior Queen: It's decent. A stuck-up ruler gets turned on by Superman and wants him for a husband, only his refusal doesn't exactly make her nice. 7.5/10

Apokolips...Now!: Darkseid is planning to assault Earth and a new addition decides to help Superman. 9/10

Apokolips...Now! Part II: It's war as Earth/Superman and Apokolips' warriors go head to head which results in a shocking end to a character. 9.5/10

Little Girl Lost: Exploring Krypton's ruins, Superman comes across a survivor on a nearby planet, who's a bit too eager to be a hero on Earth. 8/10

Little Girl Lost Part II: Superman is taken to Apokolips and Supergirl has to save him, as well as save the Earth on a global scale. 8/10

Where There's Smoke: Another decent episode as Volcana, a hot(literally) vixen causes some trouble. 7.5/10

Disc II Side A:

Knight Time: Batman's missing? And what's Superman doing impersonating him and helping Robin? Fun episode. 9/10

New Kids in Town: Brainiac wants to destroy Superman so he decides to time travel to when Superman was actually just an underdeveloped Clark Kent. 9/10

Obsession: I never liked Toyman as a villain and he's got a stalkerish obsession with a model. Bah. 6/10

Little Big Head Man: Mr. Mxypzptlk is back and he needs help taking down Superman so he recruits...Bizarro? 8.5/10

Absolute Power: Mala and Jax-Ur are back only they're in charge of a planet. 8/10

In Brightest Day: A great episode as a new Green Lantern is featured, unfortunately also being hunted. 9/10

Disc II Side B

Superman's Pal: Thanks to the press, Jimmy is ""Superman's friend"" which warrants uninvited attention. 8/10

A Fish Story: Aquaman makes an appearance and he's not to happy with Luthor. 8.5/10

Unity: Another decent episode as Supergirl and Superman have to stop a cult who worships a huge...thing. 7.5/10

The Demon Reborn: Superman has to reteam with Batman again when Ra's Al Ghul and Talia come back and they're after Superman. 8/10

Legacy: Darkseid has a new partner in crime...Superman, and he's taking the fight to Earth. 9/10

Legacy Part II: Untrusted by Earth, Superman decides to take the fight to Darkseid and end it...permanently. 9.5/10

Aside from those ""decent"" episodes, this is a great set. One complaint about the Superman TAS as opposed to Batman's is that the latter as more human drama in it, it's more compelling while Superman's more fun. It's true but still when Superman takes on Brainiac and Metallo and deflects comets, who cares right? I guess one complaint I can say about this season is that there's too many teamups, either it's with Supergirl, Green Lantern, Aquaman..., even Jimmy gets to be a sidekick. But still it's an almost flawless season. One tiny nitpick: the Superman/Darkseid fight? Toooo short.",1150934400,12,3227,4.9480519480519485
2551961,5,B000F4RH8E,"In case you don't know what I'm talking about, ""Superman, the Animated Series: Volume 3"" and ""Superman: Brainiac Attacks"" both come with a free movie pass to see ""Superman Returns"" on theaters.

Anyway, some reviewers have ranked this product low because their box-set did not come with the free movie pass.  I don't know how this could have happened because I myself received the free movie pass inside the DVD case. Also, I really would not mind not receiving the free movie pass because I bought this for the episodes. Who would spend about $20.00 on this just because it came with a free movie pass? It's cheaper at the theaters! Like anyone who actually likes and enjoys watching Superman, I bought this because it contains the final 18 episodes of the animated television series.....not because it's supposed to contain a free movie pass!!! Plus - correct me if I'm wrong, but usually animated series end up being better than the live-action movies. Remember ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" (great animated movie) and ""Batman & Robin"" (bad live-action movie). I'm not saying that ""Superman Returns"" is going to stink (I actually look foward to seeing it), but I'm just saying that you really, really, really should purchase this final superman box-set because it concludes the series we all loved as a kid.

2551965,5,B000F4RH8E,"Collecting the final 18 episodes of the all too brief Superman animated series, this volume features some of the best episodes of the show ever crafted; even though it might not seem that way upon first glance.  This volume begins innocently enough as the Man of Steel meets Maxima the Warrior Queen and has another run in with Darkseid (which sets the stage for further events), as well as teaming up with Aquaman, meeting his long lost cousin Supergirl, and taking on the usual rogues gallery.  After meeting new Green Lantern Kyle Rayner and going undercover as Batman with Robin to discover the disappearance of Bruce Wayne, everything changes.  The two part series finale, appropriately titled ""Legacy"", finds a brain washed Superman helping Darkseid conquer Earth and bringing great misery upon mankind.  This finale is arguably the best moment in the series' entire run, and it surprisingly has lasting effects that echo throughout the Justice League animated series as well.  All in all, if you dug the series, consider this volume a must own, and with the current Man of Steel marketing blitz to coincide with the upcoming mega budget Superman Returns film, now has never been a better time to see the Man of Tomorrow fly high.",1148428800,5,1236,4.923076923076923
2551966,5,B000F4RH8E,"Celebrate the Man of Tomorrow's triumphant return today with Superman: The Animated Series - Volume Three! Introducing guest-star superheroes Supergirl, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Orion and the New Gods, Legionnaires Cosmic Boy, Chameleon Boy and Saturn Girl (plus new characters Maxima and Volcana), this 2-disc set contains the 3rd (and final) wave of 18 episodes from the show's 54-episode series run.

From the far reaches of Apokolips comes the ultimate threat to planet Earth as mankind faces its most powerful enemy, the evil lord Darkseid. Darkseid's obsession with humiliating Superman and dominating the Earth feature prominently in the three excellent multi-part arcs ""Little Girl Lost"" (Supergirl debut), ""Apokolips...Now!"", and ""Legacy."" Also paying tribute to legendary comics writer/artist Jack Kirby and his Fourth World is the underrated Jimmy Olsen episode ""Superman's Pal"" (a homage to the ""Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen"" comic which Kirby used to introduce the Fourth World concept and characters) featuring the debut of the special ultrasonic frequency Superman signal watch.

The Toyman returns with an ""Obsession"" with a Barbie-perfect supermodel (a storyline which later concludes in the Static Shock season three episode ""Toys in the Hood""), while evil Kryptonians Jax-Ur (voice of Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman) and Mala (voice of Sarah Douglas, ""Ursa"" from Superman II!) return with ""Absolute Power."" Mr. Mxyzptlk is the ""Little Big Head Man"" pulling Bizarro's super-strings in a revenge plot against the Man of Steel. The episodes ""Unity"" (featuring a Superman/Supergirl team-up) and ""New Kids in Town"" (featuring three members of the Legion of Superheroes) are fine tales that would translate well as special episodes of WB's Smallville, just as ""A Fish Story"" (introducing Aquaman) was tweaked for the Smallville ""Aqua"" episode. Superman takes a walk on the dark side (under Robin's tutelage) when he masquerades as Batman in ""Knight Time,"" while villain Ra's Al Ghul takes on both heroes in ""The Demon Reborn.""

As always the voice casting is nothing short of brilliant. Steve Sandor, who was the voice of hero Darkwolf in the cult feature ""Fire and Ice"" supplies vocals for Orion in ""Apokolips...Now!"" Former TV heartthrobs Chad Lowe (Life Goes On), Jason Priestley (Beverly Hills, 90210) and Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina, the Teenage Witch) voice Legionnaires Cosmic Boy, Chameleon Boy and Saturn Girl respectively; Sharon Lawrence (NYPD Blue) channels her Gwen Leonard character from NBC's short-lived sitcom ""Fired Up"" for Maxima in ""Warrior Queen""; Peri Gilpin (Frasier) lends her smoky vocals to Volcana in ""Where There's Smoke""; ""In Brightest Day"" (introducing Green Lantern Kyle Rayner) features the voice of Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as the most menacing version of Sinestro to date; and Miguel Ferrer (Robocop) voices both ends of the spectrum as hero Aquaman in ""A Fish Story"" and villain De'Cine in ""Warrior Queen"".

8117481,5,B000F4RH8E,"This is a great third and final season to Superman the Animated Series. It ends with (SPOILER ALERT) Superman under Darkseids control, and tries to destroy the Earth for him. He eventually snaps out of his trance, and starts helping the people of Earth again. Even though he saved the world, some people no longer trust him. Lois Lane still trusts him, and they begin their new relationship. This is also a good thing because, it adds some story elements to Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, which comes later.",1515888000,,521,4.8
