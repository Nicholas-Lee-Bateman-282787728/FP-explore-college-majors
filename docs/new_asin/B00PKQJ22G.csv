6815882,5,B00PKQJ22G,"A must see, especially for younger adults in new relationships. Ordered ours, but saw the original premiere, as my husband plays Mr. Holmes, Gerald's boss. A very impassioned tale of how anger and frustration, and controlling personalities impact the lives of heir families, especially when denial and forgiveness become part of your accepting nature.",1420848000,6,351,5.518518518518518

6815900,5,B00PKQJ22G,This movie will bring you to tears. It's a reality that is so sad that so many women face daily.,1482624000,,96,3.85
6815901,4,B00PKQJ22G,"It's a pretty raw and realistic depiction of an abusive relationship. Reece Odum (Traci) and Marvin Baldwin (Gerald) are a not too loving couple though not for the lack of trying on Traci's part. Gerald is the poster child for an abusive husband. The first 5 minutes of the film takes you there right out of the gate with a clash over cold bacon.  To make matters worse,  he loses his job and becomes even more abusive. You will literally want to reach through the screen and punch out Gerald's  lights for the poor woman. Marvin Baldwin definitely plays a good bad guy and we feel the torture and despair in Reece Odum's performance. Unfortunately it depicts an all too often scenario. Good acting and a tense, emotional ride.",1479168000,,727,4.62015503875969

6815908,5,B00PKQJ22G,This movie was crazy but I realize this happens in real life.

A must see.,1441670400,,299,4.0508474576271185
6815909,1,B00PKQJ22G,"I bought this movie because although it only had 5 ratings, they all were 5 star ratings at the time, but when I got the movie and watch it, me and my wife couldn't help but laugh at the poor acting and low budget recording of the film. This is in no way a 5 star movie, and for that reason I am giving it 1 start to bring it back down to reality so people will get the real understanding on the film. I would have saved my money for something else...it was definitely not worth adding to my collection of movies.",1441065600,2,513,3.9902912621359223

6815912,5,B00PKQJ22G,"This movie speaks major volumes to those in abusive situations searching for a way out. So disheartening to know that women and men become victims of abuse.
