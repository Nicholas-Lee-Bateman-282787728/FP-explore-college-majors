8218309,1,B000VDL1YA,"A documentary showing the bought opinions of 6 British so called historians who do not receive any lectureship outside Turkey.
What they deny is prooven by more than 300 international historians!
The pictures are radomly chosen ones from masscres happened all around world. The critical viewer will soon realize that there is no proove and not even a hint that the pictures really show what their discription is trying to make us believe!
For those who like to know about what really happened I warmly recommend the German documentary ""Aghet-A genocide"", the BBC doc ""The Betrayed"" or the Swedish film ""Grandma's Tattos"".
Furthermore please consider e.g. the studies of Taner Akcam, Fatma Muege Goektuerk, Dogan Akanli, Tessa Hoffmann, Hans-Lukas Kieser, etc.
To get more literatural inspiration the French webpage imprescriptible.com The mentionned literature exists also in English!

8218310,5,B000VDL1YA,"The full title of the documentary is ""Sari'Gelin: The Inside Story of the Armenian Problem"".
 It deals with the events of 1915, when, so many Genocide scholars and also an increasing number of Turks say, at least a million Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire were forcibly sent into exile. Many people starved, died of exhaustion or were killed state organized gangs. This documentary is just another attempt of Genocide denial by the Turkish state. As of right now because of a UN convention rule  Genocide may not be legally applied to any event before 1948; but, today the term Genocide has been applied to past events  when deemed fit morally,in world literature and as well as a historical reference.
Immorality of this latest attempt of unabashed denial (by the Turkish state) is only surpassed in their insistence on continuing this Genocide by their forefathers at least in a way of Genocide denial.",1305417600,2,911,4.9411764705882355
8218311,1,B000VDL1YA,"""Sari Gelin"" is a Turkish production and only acepted by Turks as being an objective ""documentary"". Even ""The History Foundation of Turkey - Tarih Vakf'"" in Istanbul calls this production ""propaganda"". Not worth spending his time with.

8218312,5,B000VDL1YA,"This documentary clearly shows how the Armenian youth is being raised in hatered. You can understand that they are a big risk for the peace and the future of the region. You can clearly understand how easy it was for Armeninas to look like the sufferers of a genocide while they were the genocide makers themselves. The documentary clearly depends on official historic documents. You can only view this matter objectively from this view of angel, not from Armenian propaganda stuff. I still can't believe how easily we were deceived by our media, and thought that Turks were the genocide makers. This is a must if you want to learn more about the so called ""Armenian genocide"".",1240790400,6,677,4.794871794871795
