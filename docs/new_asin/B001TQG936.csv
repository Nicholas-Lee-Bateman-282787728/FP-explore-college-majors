8342263,5,B001TQG936,This is a very short but effective workout.  Good for days when your short in time but still need to get a workout in.  The instructor Allie is by far my favorite firm instructor who makes this short workout fun.  Highly recommend.,1468108800,4,231,4.4523809523809526

8342267,3,B001TQG936,"I work out all the time but I found this challenging, using a different set of muscles.  Its very short and I find myself not using it as much as I thought I would.  I do like it though.",1409702400,,186,3.7435897435897436
8342268,3,B001TQG936,"I use this video in conjunction with The Firm TransFIRMation video set. I do this exercise after I do the Express version of any given video in that set. This one makes me struggle just enough to break into a sweat. My one complaint is minor: The stick is supposedly 9 pounds, but when I have to lift it, it feels lighter and I don't feel like I'm putting in a lot of effort. Still, I have lost 8 pounds in 3 months and I am 70 pounds away from where I'd like to be. I am hoping that at this time next year, I will be a lot lighter.",1403740800,2,532,3.8454545454545452
8342269,5,B001TQG936,"This is a fun, short and effective workout. Been doing the Firm workouts over the years and I Allie is one of my favorite instructors.  I just got the dvd, but have the older sculpting stick to use.  You can also use a body bar and light weights as a substitute.",1318032000,9,262,4.117647058823529
8342270,4,B001TQG936,"Allie Del Rio has always been my favorite Firm instructor. She cues the best and in my opinion the most real of all the instructors. I purchased this DVD mainly because I wanted the sculpting stick. Don't be fooled by the short 20 minutes of this  workout. It's a great boost that keeps me energized throughout the day. I consider myself a fit weight and strength training 30 something. I've danced most of my life and have gone through all the Firm workouts as well as the P90X DVDs. I don't love to work out but I also know the importance and benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  I'm a morning workout person and usually by Friday I'm so exhausted from the week that I hate getting up early on that last day. The Power Sculpt is the perfect solution to a quick fix routine that really gets the heart rate up.

Allie is accompanied by two background instructors. They do not modify the routine as it is fast paced. She warms up by breaking up the sticks and you're using two of the three sticks at one time. Sometimes this feels a bit heavy to  me but adjust to your comfort level and you'll eventually be able to increase.

All in all a great routine!",1282262400,9,1150,4.330232558139535
8342271,5,B001TQG936,Great product.  I got the best workout I've gotten from this than from any other workout I've tried.  It's also only about 15 to 20 minutes so a busy person can get an intense workout without spending a lot of time.,1278028800,10,215,4.219512195121951
