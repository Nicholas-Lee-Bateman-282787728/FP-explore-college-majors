8465401,4,B005CFUNSM,"Our family loves Veggietales.  My son is especially infatuated with them and since I enjoy them too I don't mind watching them over and over again.  They are clean, promote family values, the parents are intelligent and give good advice which is not common in most children's programming lately.  The only thing I wish I had known before getting this set is that they are not all the full episodes. Seven episodes are missing their beginning ""short.""  The episodes with a missing short are Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush (missing Jr. dealing with bullies), Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler (Archibald in a Man of La Mancha spoof which was really tedious so no great loss), Sweetpea Beauty (""Snoodlerella""), Gideon: Tuba Warrior (story of George Mueller), Sumo of the Opera (a cute 3 stooges spoof), Abe and the Amazing Promise (Blunders in Boo-Boo ville) and Duke and the great Pie War (Babysitter in DeNile, story of Miriam and Moses. Once we discovered this, however, it was still well worth it to keep the set because of how much cheaper it was this way.",1352505600,8,1084,4.811827956989247
