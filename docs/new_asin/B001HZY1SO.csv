8310278,3,B001HZY1SO,"OK. Here's the deal. Picture a high school drama class, grabbing a few guys from the high school football team, stopping by a Goodwill store and a fabric store, then going off to some parkland with a motion picture camera and filming themselves acting out the Robin Hood legend.

That's the movie.",1498953600,,297,4.711538461538462
8310279,5,B001HZY1SO,"This was a fun movie to watch and very creative. Its unique for its time, and I don't know of any other American made Robin Hood.
While this movie may be low budget it certainly captures the spirit of Robin Hood. Moreover, it's amazing how young the director was when he made this movie.",1463443200,,287,4.333333333333333

This one, sorry to say, is fairly horrific, easily the worst of the lot (with ROBIN HOOD AND THE PIRATES not being all that good, either - apologies, Lex Barker).

This is a really dodgy picture. I didn't think it was possible for an hour-long adventure film to drag, but here's the reality of it come to kick me in the groin. ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF SHERWOOD comes off as strictly amateur hour. Just about everything about it is subpar, from the lame performances to the absurd screenplay, and compounded.by a meager budget. Shot entirely on 16mm film, the cinematography underwhelms, especially when you factor in that Alabama doubles as Sherwood Forest. Somewhere in those disreputable video stores that all of us dudes frequent, there's a certain curtain hiding the naughty flicks. But back of that room is yet another curtain, behind which you can find copies of this skunker. I figured it was gonna be rough as soon as I saw Robin Hood running around wearing pajama pants and a cloak that looks like a bedsheet cover.

The movie features familiar classic elements from the Robin Hood mythos: Robin's splitting of an arrow, his skirmish with staffs with Little John, etc. There is, as well, some lifting of ideas from ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES. Somewhere, Kevin Costner is rolling over in his grave. I don't care that he's not dead yet.

There are plenty of dead spots. The action sequences are poorly staged. The dialogue suffers from awkward and very mannered delivery. Most of the cast don't even try to assume an English accent, but the few who do, their accents come and go. Thankfully, the strident film score is always threatening to drown out all the talking. And my guess is that the equipment guy got a great deal on sixty-six French horns, and they're all being played. It all makes one wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around to do this movie justice.

There's a scene in which a henchman brings bad news to the Sheriff, and the Sheriff scolds him soundly: ""Why is it every time I start to feel halfway decent, you have to come in here with your scurrilous way and ruin it for me?"" Except that the actor doesn't really enunciate the ""scurrilous"" part, so I'm thinking that one word could very well be ""scurviest"" or ""scullery"" or ""Spartacus."" I frankly prefer ""asparagus"" because it makes me guffaw.

More things to ponder:

- The Sheriff of Nottingham's beard will achieve the believability of a fake beard.

- When Robin Hood wallows in self-pity over the capture of Lady Marian, one of his merry men will get up and say, ""Well, I'm outta here.""

- Even though his army consists of, like, five dudes, Robin Hood will still get up on an elevated platform to make his big impassioned speech.

- When, in profile, one guy thrusts a sword into that empty space between an opponent's arm and ribcage, that opponent will always collapse and DIE!

- During the fake King Richard's rallying speech, he'll hit puberty and also be ridiculously over-the-top.

- Robin Hood will come up with the brilliantly original line: ""You killed my father!!""

- The actress who plays Marian will vaguely resemble Helena Bonham Carter, this causing Helena Bonham Carter to also roll over in her grave.

- When a bad guy is about to kill one of Robin's men, as a courtesy the bad guy will pause eight seconds with sword upraised while Robin Hood looks for an arrow.

Avoid this movie, or forevermore lose all faith in the goodness of man. And you'll probably start hating Alabama, too.",1252195200,10,4533,5.522366522366522
