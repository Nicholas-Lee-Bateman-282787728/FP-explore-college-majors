__________________________________________________________________________________________

From director John Erick Dowdle of 2008's `Quarantine` comes a terrifying journey into the darkest places on earth. When archeologist, Scarlette, discovers a finding that may lead to the discovery of a sorcerer's stone, she along with her friend George partners with outsiders to uncover the whereabouts of this historic artifact. However, they must go deep into the catacombs beneath the streets of Paris that in of itself is all too dangerous. But the further they venture through the tunnels and discovery leads to discovery, their deepest fears will come realized and the sorcerer's stone may become the least of their worries.

There's a sense of familiarity in the filmmaking as Dowdle's `Quarantine` is similar to what he presents in `As Above, So Below` with respects to found-footage. The lead character in this film is Scarlett, who is played by Perdita Weeks, who is more curious into the history behind the stone rather than gaining anything from it, like wealth or fame. You understand from the get go why she is going through with the search and the film does something different as it relates to her character. Rather than following the tropes of characters who get themselves involved in dangerous situations, such like in `Quarantine`, Scarlett is unsure what to expect as is with the audience while watching. Do characters make dumb decisions as the clich&eacute; goes in horror? Yes, but it is rectified as I'll explain later.

What I felt as Scarlett and her pals journeyed through the tunnels finding artifacts and going through tight spaces was that it was like watching `The Goonies` except an adult version with horror. There is a moment when Scarlett discovers what she had been looking for that if too greedy consequences will follow. Adding Alchemy into the script was risky because if your not familiar with it you may be confused along the way. But if you know just a smidgen of the topic or have even heard of it, you should be in good shape. Scarlett was a strong character who didn't fall under pressure or collapse under fear. Perdita Weeks did great and was more logical in her decision-making that it didn't bother me even if it meant moving deeper and deeper into the tunnels.

The writers did an interesting take on Alchemy that added mystery and science as Scarlett and the group get caught in a predicament. Going into the film and after watching the trailer you think the film is just straight up horror. Rather, with the discussions of Alchemy and the time period it eludes too, you come to understand yes it's dark and yes there's dead bodies lying around but it's a little smarter then that. Credit where credits due to the writers for incorporating the topic of Alchemy and the director being able to use dark elements such as underground tunnels, cemeteries, and visually appealing set pieces to add to the anxiety.

In every scenario there are positives and then there are negatives. Where the story suffers is that the viewer may not be aware what is going on when discussions of Alchemy are taking place. There are moments between Scarlett and George (Ben Feldman) as they translate ancient markings in the beginning of the film that sometimes isn't clear what they are talking about. That's why I say if your not sure what Alchemy is you may be lost in some of the translations and dialogue that takes place between the two. The pacing could have been better but when the film hits the half way mark it goes full speed and the terror begins. Another thing to mention is that there are a lot of tight spaces in the tunnels that it may feel too claustrophobic for some viewers. But to it's benefit the director did a great job making the viewer feel stuck and almost puts you in the same position as some of the characters are in.

As with any found-footage there are commonalities; especially with horror movies. With Dowdle following the same path as `Quarantine` but with different circumstances surround the characters, `As Above, So Below` is a journey to the unknown and one that can be pleasing at times. It may come familiar with some of the clich&eacute;s in other films such as `The Goonies` where people have to push forward in order to escape, but it benefits from the Alchemy component in the script. Though not original or new, you'll leave appreciating what the film tried bringing to the table.",1409529600,2,4540,4.8896103896103895
6611706,1,B00N5AICVQ,"I really don't know why I keep watching these found footage movies.  I guess I keep hoping that one of them will be the next Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity, two of my favorite horror films of all time.  But I keep being disappointed again and again and again.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The movie started out awesome!  We have an urban archeologist sneaking into Iran to look for something hidden deep inside some tunnels but the government is going to blow them up so she is racing against the clock!  This was awesome!  It had me rooting for her and hoping she would get what she needed and make it back to safety before it was too late!  But once she got the info she needed and got out of there, it was all down hill after that.

If she really wanted to go into the Parisian catacombs, why didn't she just go get a permit?  I'm sure she could get permission from the government to go down there and the police and locals would probably help her so they could bring more fame to the city and the local universities.  But no, she decides to go to the criminal underworld and get some local urban spelunkers to help her. She tells them there is ""treasure"" down there and they can have some of it if they help her.  Why not just pay them instead of concocting some elaborate lie to dupe them into taking her and her team into the catacombs?

So then they get down there and instantly get lost in the ""Tunnel-That-No-One-Comes-Back-From,"" and they start seeing things that they have guilt and regret about.  But the film-maker just keeps throwing stuff on the screen to try to scare us and not explain to us why they are there or why we should be scared of them.  Like those women in white who are singing some weird song in a room full of candles.  Or the guy in the black robe who is walking around very slowly and sitting in an archaic looking chair.  Even those people who were in the walls covered in white dust.  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  Why are they there?  We're never given any explanation to any of this.

One by one they are picked off and they die based on things they feel guilty about doing in their past.  The girl takes what is called the ""Philosopher's Stone"" from a room and it has the power to heal people and turn elements into gold.  But apparently she broke some rule and she has to talk through some riddles to figure out what she did wrong.  Also she keeps repeating something throughout the movie that sounds suspiciously like part of the Sinestro Corps Oath.  So she figures out she has to put the stone back and come to terms with what she did wrong, once that is done she runs back to help her friends.

Then she does something that I actually liked and wished that more women did in horror films.  When she comes up on the dangerous people in white, she PUNCHES THEM IN THE FACE!!!  I actually said out loud, ""FINALLY!""  We get a character in this movie who doesn't just shriek and run away from the bad guys she takes them out with her fists!

So then she is able to heal her friend who has a wound in his neck just by touching them.  Okay does that mean the stone is now in her?  Is she now some kinda mystic healer?  Plus what is this loud sorta music that we are constantly hearing in the background?  They admit that they hear it too but it's never explained as to what it is or why it's there.  I really don't mind a bit of mystery in a horror film, but I like when we get some clarification.

Moving along she convinces the two remaining characters to jump down a hole and they fall like 500 feet and somehow survive, they find a manhole cover.  Instead of lifting it, they push it and slide it to the side and they flip around so they are standing right side up when they get out of the manhole and they are back on the streets of Paris.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

This movie was just utterly ridiculous and the characters just keep doing things that make no sense at all.  Why would you hear something scary in the distance and then go TOWARD it?  Why do they see a creepy person in all black and keep looking at him instead of running away from him?  Why do they see a person who hung himself and go toward it after all that's happened?  When seeing a guy who was supposedly missing for a few years suddenly shows up and seems to be teleporting around these tunnels, they keep following him.  WHY!?!  Get away from him!  There's obviously something wrong with this guy!

I really wanted to like this movie, the previews made it look amazing!  But the ridiculous story and constant jump scares just made me think the movie was a waste of time and money.

Wait to rent this movie and save your money.",1409356800,4,4724,4.32004555808656
6611707,1,B00N5AICVQ,"As Above/So Below turns on a group of intrepid archaeologists and urban explorers who descend into the catacombs beneath Paris in search of the philosopher's stone, the mythical elixir of life.  (In this continuity, Dumbledore clearly did not destroy it!)  A type of treasure-map scenario conjuring memories of Indiana Jones or the Declaration of Independence as absconded with by Nicolas Cage turns into a nightmare--for the characters and for the audience--when a cave-in precedes a night of geographical confusion, thunderous noises, and ambiguous supernatural presences.  To be blunt, this film is a dud.  There is not much content here, and almost none of it deserves even guarded praise.  I grant there are a few fleeting, yet interesting moments involving characters experiencing macabre visions of unresolved tragedies or wrongdoings from the past (a father's suicide for one, an abandoned child for another).  And the actors, each no doubt glad to be in any studio film and hopeful for more substantial roles in the future, acquit themselves around as well as can be expected considering the mediocre and thin nature of the project as a whole.  This is to say, they argue and gasp and run and scream for their lives with relative authenticity.

The film's flaws are legion, no pun intended.  There is a thorough and truly dire dearth of imagination on display.  These characters may very well have climbed via the catacombs into the depths of Hades itself (Dante is referenced), but much of the film consists of them racing to and fro in what could be the same faux-stone set.  The vast potential for indelible otherworldly imagery is almost entirely ignored.  Satan's playground is simply tedious here.  This is also a film where I found the found-footage presentation extremely grating.  I say this as a person who considers The Blair Witch Project an enduring favorite and has enjoyed most of the Paranormal Activity sequels, too.  Here, however, the constant up, down, right, and left movement of the camera made me a tad nauseous, a problem compounded by a strobe-style editorial technique utilized during every action and suspense sequence to emulate, I presume, the characters' put-upon, GoPro-style cameras succumbing to and then withstanding abuse.  It also, of course, allows the low-budget film to fragment and disorient its set pieces rather than having any of them unfold with clarity or elegance.  The awful aesthetic combines with at times ponderous, at times rushed screenplay to render certain third-act plot points more convoluted than they have any right to be.",1409270400,10,2589,5.170263788968825
6611708,3,B00N5AICVQ,"As Above, So Below (John Erick Dowdle, 2014)

The first John Erick Dowdle movie I saw was 2008's Quarantine, one of the few American remakes of foreign horror films that's actually worth your time. I then went back and hunted down his previous film, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, and between the two of them, I came to the conclusion that the seeds of celluloid greatness lie dormant somewhere within John Erick Dowdle. Every movie he has released since has been increasingly frustrating for me; they are never disappointingI have never failed to be at least entertained by a movie he's directedbut he never actually gets there. With As Above, So Below, I think those seeds are starting to germinate. Don't get me wrong, this is not a Ti West-like metamorphosis from genre hack to wunderkind in the space of six months, but it is a step in the right direction.

Plot: Scarlett (Prowl's Perdita Weeks) is a polymaththe first scene of the main film, which comes after a Raiders of the Lost Ark-style prologue that's great for getting the adrenaline pumping, is Scarlett standing outside an archaeological dig introducing herself with a list of credentials longer than her purported age; cameraman Benji (The Purge's Edwin Hodge) even remarks that's a lot of credentials for someone your age when she's done. She has taken up the quest her father was on, before he committed suicide: the quest for the philosopher's stone. Yes, everyone from Harry Potter to Aleister Crowley is now joined by another seeker and her loyal cameraman. During the prologue, Scarlett found a legendary artifact that will allow her to translate the sigils on the tombstone of equally legendary alchemist Nicolas Flamel (in popular legend, the only human to have ever actually created a philosopher's stone) into Aramaic. Sine she doesn't speak it, she has to convince her old friend George (Cloverfield's Ben Feldman) to help her. We get some dark intimations about the last time he did so, but she's charming and manipulative and gets her way. (Don't feel too bad for George; he pulls the same trick on a museum guide a few scenes later.) When the clues point them to the catacombs that lie underneath Paris, Scarlett and Benji take a trip down there with a map they've sketched out, discover the basic location of what they're looking for, and are told by a guy who's hanging around sketching a wall to go looking for a guy nicknamed Papillon, who can get them where they want to be. Soon enough, they meet up with Papillon (Elles' Franois Civil) and his urban-explorer friends Souxie (Marion Lambert in her screen debut) and Zed (Zero Dark Thirty's Ali Marhyar). The six of themGeorge doesn't do subterranean treks, but has agreed to help the party get where they're going and then coordinate from above-groundhead into an abandoned railway tunnel that provides an alternate entrance to the catacombs. A series of misadventures lands all of them, including George, in a chamber with no way out except down. And that's when things start getting really weird.

At the base of As Above, So Below is an extremely intelligent script; John and partner/co-writer Drew either did more research for this than they ever have before or (more likely) have a long-standing and enduring love for the source material. And what that source material is is as clear to me as it was opaque to the people I saw it with (and, seemingly, most reviewers): Dante Alighieri. Yep, As Above, So Below is another, looser than I've ever seen before, attempt to translate the Inferno to the silver screen. Papillon's old friend Le Taupe (Los Malagradecideos' Cosme Castro)who, we are told, has been living in the catacombs for yearsis the Virgil to Scarlett's Dante. And, of course, the way out is down; Dante had to go all the way to the bottom and meet the devil before he could advance to the second book of the Commedia. So do our travelers. (In fact, Scarlett barely misses mentioning Alighieri by name at one point.) Sorry if that's a spoilergiven the film's trailer, I don't believe it is.

As well, while there is no scene in this movie as claustrophobic as that scene in The Descent, in As Above, So Below the claustrophobia is more a pervasive feeling. The Descent loaded it on in little tunnels between massive caverns. These folks spend very little time in little chambers, much less massive caverns. Well over half this movie takes place in hallways, some of which are slightly smaller than Benji's hips. (I will say that there's one scene where Dowdle was trying to work that Descent angle. While it's definitely claustrophobic, it's defused by some possibly-unintentional humor.)  I know, the whole shakycam-found-footage thing is really played out now, but Dowdle, as he does every time he uses it, at least found some inventive ways to use it effectively. The same is true of his use of chiaroscuro, which in this film may be as good as David Lynch's (and Lynch is the current American master of chiaroscuro). Sure, he's using it mostly for cheap jumps, but it adds up. And those cheap jumps work really well in this movie. Like the original When a Stranger Calls well. The first time Benji's helmet light goes on the fritz may be the most perfectly-timed moment in the movie.

A quick side note on understanding the last thirty minutes of the movie: it's pretty straightforward, including the ending, but much of the audience around me seemed somewhat confused. There's a point where Scarlett explains the title of the movie to Papillon's crew while explaining a medieval painting on the wall. Okay, once you get there, pay very close attention to what she says the second time they see that symbol, and keep it in mind for the rest of the movie, and all of it will make sense.

As far as the frustrating part...I started off by talking about the intelligent script. I think parts of it got left on the cutting room floor. There were a lot of pieces I ended up wanting more information on (like the scar on Papillon's hand, which ends up feeling like a plot device rather than the character-building angle it obviously was in some draft). As Above, So Below fits the current ninety-minutes-and-out model of American filmmaking, coming in at a shade over ninety-two. It could have easily been twice as long just based on the parts that obviously aren't therethe history between Papillon and Zed, Souxie's entire character. I suspect there is a great deal more to Le Taupe; I think at one point he may have been a major character. (And the possible interplay between the butterfly and the mole? Where were they going with that?) In fact, I can tie so many things about this movie that felt abbreviated, short, or mediocre to possible editing cuts or overzealous script revisions that I'd be willing to toss out a blanket statement that a director's cut, if it puts back in at least an hour of footage, might be one of the best movies of 2014. What we got fits right in line with Dowdle's previous output. It is an entertainment, and a pretty good one, but you may well find yourself more annoyed by the pieces that aren't there than appreciative of the ones that are. ***",1409270400,68,7128,4.766801619433198

6611717,5,B00N5AICVQ,"A group of wanna-be Indiana Joneses go spelunking in the forbidden parts of the Paris Catacombs and get trapped inside. As they're forced to go deeper and deeper, things start getting weird and creepy.

I've always been forgiving if a horror film has a story I enjoy, and I really did enjoy this. No, it's not incredibly scary. There are a few moments of good suspense and one of two jump-scares that work, but I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat. The premise is simple, even if it's not particularly unique. If you watch the trailer, you can probably guess where the story goes. Hell, even if you don't watch it, you can probably predict where it's going to go within 30 minutes.

But, I admire how the story plays out. The have a concept for their story and they unapologetically go full-bore with it. They use the atmosphere of the setting to great advantage and they obviously have a lot of fun playing with it. They're willing to push the story to the brim of believability and then say, ""Screw it, let's go over-the-top,"" in the final 20 minutes. And, as far as I'm concerned, the vast majority of it works. Not only does it work, it works with style. They treat their audience with respect by expecting them to add-up the clues as the characters are adding them up. Not once does a character explicitly say what's going on, they just allow the situation to be obvious in due time.

All the technical requirements are met. The acting it strong, it looks and sounds good -- well, as good as a found-footage film should look. As far as the found-footage-ness goes, you don't need to worry about vomit-inducing shakey-cam, which is always a bonus. The set design is strong and atmospheric, probably because they used the actual catacombs.

While trying to think of cons for the film, right now I only come back to one scene involving a burning car. I won't go into details, but it uses some CG that doesn't quite work, but which I'm willing to forgive since it marks the beginning of the film really going over-the-top.

We must realize that our past shaped us into who we are in our present daily life. Our future is a road yet still filled with the possibility of more mistakes if we've not accepted our past & learned from it. I enjoyed the alchemist idea of finding a 'philosopher's stone' & the symbolic imagery that can be found in archaelogical dig sites around the world & how these findings of the past relates or connects in our present technological 'world.' Sadly the ending was a wasted opportunity to use regarding what these young individuals, who've already made mistakes, have learned about their life in general. Did they accept their past mistakes, strive to live better lives in their present & think about what they'd like their future to be? Some very good scary imagery, especially if one is claustrophobic.

It was a great movie with a great message, however it didn't get 5 stars because I'm not all entirely a fan of the first person POV style movies. The screen moves to much (although I get it adds more suspense) and makes me feel a lil woozy on my big screen TV. Great movie though, you should watch!",1508112000,,414,3.9404761904761907

6611767,5,B00N5AICVQ,"This movie should be classified as an adventure story with horror elements; the protagonist reminded me of Lara Croft and she certainly acted like it. People are losing their cool in the catacombs and she's smashing monsters in the face and solving ancient puzzles. The plot actually felt original for a horror film and the movie revolved around that rather devolving into a chaotic gore fest coupled with numerous terrible life decisions.

6611773,5,B00N5AICVQ,"I know it's quite a bold statement, but I would rank this movie #2 in the Top 10 of the 21st century... yes, above the Conjuring (which although I admit it was GREAT, I honestly think it was one of the most overrated movies... ""scariest since the Exorcist""? I don't think so.) and Sinister. I would place this in between It Follows at #1 (THE most original and psychologically disturbing horror movie of the 2000s) and Cabin in the Woods at #3. I use 2000 as the starting point for comparisons since Blair Witch Project was 1999, and IMHO that was the last truly scary horror flick before the turn of the century... not that the 90s offered much of ANYTHING by the way of GOOD horror....

I really don't understand all the negative reviews... Rotten Tomatos gives it a 26% approval rating with an average 4.4/10 stars. This is probably the most well done found footage film since the first two Paranormal Activity movies. Much like From Dusk Till Dawn, where the movie begins and where it ends up taking you are completely unexpected with no indication of what's around the next corner. From the moment they enter the catacombs, there is an overwhelming sense of dread and claustrophobia. That ""trapped"" feeling and the building tension are key to what makes this movie so great. No it doesn't have a lot of gore or that overused (and stupid) idea of a ghost/creature appearing behind the person then suddenly disappearing when they turn back around... now seriously, if you're some sort of entity bent on a person's destruction, what purpose does it serve to keep popping up BEHIND them and where they can't see you!? It's practically admitting that the whole scene is for the benefit of the audience rather than the protagonist.

If you're a fan of psychological and truly original horror, pick this one up. And if you're not, try going into it with an open mind and the lights off.

For the record, my Top 10 from just the 2010s (newer movies) is (in no particular order): As Above So Below, It Follows, Cabin in the Woods, Haunter, The Babadook, Sinister, Lights Out, Insidious, The Witch, and Would You Rather, with an honorable mention going to Evil Dead since it's a remake, and the new Alien: Covenant most likely displacing one of the aforementioned movies when I finally see it.",1495238400,,2288,4.672456575682382

6611780,5,B00N5AICVQ,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out. A girl I was dating at the time wanted to go to the movies, and suggested we see As Above So Below. I had never heard of it. Never saw a trailer, never read a review, nothing. It wasn't until I bought the tickets that I even knew what it was. We broke up a few weeks after seeing this movie, but I didn't care. The only reason I really even think about her is because of this movie.
I love found footage movies. I'm team found footage all the way. Us found footage buffs are more harsh on the ones that suck, where as people who hate found footage films won't even recognize a great film, simply because it is found footage.
The opening scene was not bad by any means, but it didn't do anything for me. It seemed like it was going to be another movie that was just an excuse to take a girl to see a scary movie.
Once the main character makes mention of Alchemy, it peaked my interests. And then when she mentions the Paris Catacombs, I was hooked.
I know of only one other movie that uses the Paris Catacombs as it's location, and that movie was AWFUL.
As Above So Below gave the Paris Catacombs the honor that it deserves as being an amazing, beautiful, horrifying location.
You realize a little while in that it follows the premise of Dante's Inferno. And if you don't notice this by a certain point in the movie, you will see it when you get to the scene where George translates the writing above the tunnel as ""Abandon hope, All ye who enter here.""

Never had the right timing or moments to want to put it in, as this kind of movie, like the Descent and Catacombs and The Pyramid you need to be in a certain type of mood, it's gotta be at night when you watch it with all the lights out, you have to have the right state of mind to take it all in. Tonight was such a night!

Pretty stellar. I have to watch it again to get all the alchemy references, so forth, and understand the entire referencing towards the phrase 'As Above, So Below'; but all in all, I expected more of Descent type creatures for some reason for the past couple of years while this was cued up, but alas it certainly wasn't really like that at all.

Of course, the setting of this film is amazing too! The Catacombs below Paris have always been a fascinating subject to me, so I was curious to watch this movie. I just shudder to think about being trapped beneath the earth, the only way to go being down... however, I still would love to visit them, even though this movie did give me the willies about it!

This is one of those ""found footage"" movies, so if you do not appreciate jerky filming and heavy breathing from the camera holder, then this is not for you. I must say, though, it was done in excellent fashion and it feels like you're down there with them, which makes it all the more intense!

The gory horror didn't really hit until close to the end of the movie. it sort of began with survival horror as the group tried to find their way out of the catacombs and then worked it's way up into scare and gore. i would say it was psychological too as the group finds their way passed the, in theory, gates of hell. as they get further and further into hell (im assuming) they are haunted by things in their past which were hinted at throughout the movie. im not typically a fan of first person movies (like blair witch and paranormal activity) but my curiosity for the plot made me ignore that aspect. all in all it was good. it wasn't anything super scary or gory, but if the idea of being stuck underground in closed spaces truly scares you than watch it, that was probably the scariest aspect for me.",1469664000,,893,4.3532934131736525

It's set in underground tunnels beneath Paris with a group of young people interested in alchemy looking for a mystical stone and hidden treasures down there they've been able to ascertain from deciphering Aramaic texts on tombstones and such.

 It sounds much more interesting than it actually turns out to be in a sort of Blair Witch Project/Da Vinci Code hybrid that never really works due to the lack of genuine scares unlike another underground movie (albeit caves) 'The Descent' which I thought was brilliant due to the fear it instilled in you.

The idea that anyone today, especially a very educated person with multiple master's degrees, would embark on a search for the philosopher's stone - we're talking alchemy here folks - is pretty ludicrous.

6611920,2,B00N5AICVQ,"Yet another found-footage film. There's something about having a first-person POV as you turn the corner of some dark tunnel, praying that there's nothing on the other side.

As Above, So Below is rift with these twists and turns. Essentially the story is about a group of explorers and researchers seeking treasure in the catacombs underneath the city of Paris. They venture off into an uncharted path and their only way out is to keep going down.

The film starts off fairly novel and interesting, despite the over used genre. It even got a few jolts of surprise out of me. As the crew keep venturing deeper into the catacombs, ominous signs warn them ""to give up hope, all ye who enter."" The viewer's sense that something evil lurks in the tunnels is kept in suspension until half way through the film. Wouldn't it be interesting for a found-film drama to actually not devolve into ghouls and zombies? Once the crew started to heal broken limbs and encounter other hellish creatures of their imaginations, my suspension of fear turned to confusion.

There are as many reasons why this was a 2 out of 5 stars for me. The plot was promising. The acting was pretty good. However, it was only good because the characters' motivations were common place. Back stories were revealed as the film went on (smart move), until that itself became cliched, because it was done for every character.

Ultimately, where it lost me was that switch in plot. Suddenly it was no longer about surviving the catacombs, but a test of magical thinking. I like a good theological drama, which seems like where this was trying to go, but it was poorly executed.

If you are looking for  a Christian horror novel, pick up the Bible and read Revelations. That's the great piece of horror lit.",1451088000,2,1767,4.702265372168285

The photography, very shaky and amateurish, is meant to give the feel of one of the crew photographing as ""we"" follow.  Personally, I find it extremely annoying and makes the movie very hard to watch.",1450656000,2,516,4.896551724137931

And then the movie lost its magic..

It felt like the person who wrote the first 25 minutes of this film went on vacation and a less skilled person took over.  The story went from horror to more like a mystical adventure underground.  Sure there was still a few random shock and awe moments in the film..but it was so far below the level of horrow I was expecting to see.",1446249600,,600,4.36036036036036

If you watch the special features you see where they filmed it which was the ONLY cool thing about it. The filmed it in Paris in the tunnels! They only put a LOT more of bones in the tunnels and none of the tunnles they went into were ""unexplored"" kinda annoying but hey the tunnels were cool.
Oh and if you didn't mind an acid trip way back when this is the movie for you! They find random stuff in the tunnels (like a pinano, burning car or an old phone ringing) and how they got them in there I have no clue!",1445558400,,762,3.891025641025641

In order to have the film long enough, you see the ""exploration part"" twice: one with characters afraid, one with Indiana Jane kicking the monster's butt (in between, nothing changed, so why not do it first time around?).
Jumpscare is the equivalent in horror to referential humour in comedy: s***ty cheap technique.
Ah: and if you really know Paris and its catacombs, it's even more funny, because even if they filmed in the real tunnels, fact is they go into famouse zones and places so, as a spectator, I was never lost.

The best way I can think to describe it is a Halloween haunted house on film. Frankly I was getting bored toward the end, and just threw up my hands at the pointless ending.
I suppose if you're a psycholy student, or if you're claustrophobic you might get something out of this. Otherwise I honestly wouldn't bother.  Go pick up Final Prayer, or The Descent instead.

6611957,5,B00N5AICVQ,"I absolutely loved this film. I'm very picky about what horror I watch, I don't like movies that are overly poppy and jumpy, that's such a turn off for me, it always seems so cheap when films are designed around cheap thrills.

To be fair, this film might have been a bit poppy in places, or maybe it felt that way, or maybe I think I'm supposed to say that it felt that way at least a little bit,

Because I absolutely loved this film and don't have anything but praise for it.

This is very oblique - it's more for an arthouse crowd than popular cinemas, the imagery is absolutely beautiful, the claustrophobia is heart stopping, several times I started sobbing at some of the things this film had achieved.

This film achieves a rather beautiful and non-linear synthesis of Catholic and Occult imagery that works so, so well because there is never any hint at explanation. Everything stands on its own, what you're seeing is what you're seeing. Nothing ruins a film more than back story or trying to explain why what's happening is happening - if what's happened outside of the film's narrative arc is so important then why watch the film?

I've not seen a ton of found footage films, but I really, really liked this. It feels super claustrophobic at times, and there were a couple things here and there I found kind of weak,

But you really feel for the characters really quickly. It's nice to see academia well represented in film - scholarship always makes for a good movie.

The music is well done, too, it's sparse, but super cool sounding.

So yeah - if you like David Lynch and Roman Polanski filtered through a kind of box-office-found-footage-flair, this movie is really incredible.",1440201600,,1694,4.623333333333333

6611964,2,B00N5AICVQ,"I've said it before and sadly, I must say it again...some perfectly okay horror films have been much diminished by having silly or incomprehensible endings.  Sure, every movie wants to do something like leave room for a sequel...but too many horror films (in particular) seem to fumble their conclusions/climaxes.  Finding a satisfactory resolution for something that's already requiring more suspension of disbelief than usual is just tough.

AS ABOVE, SO BELOW certainly falls into that trap. It has an excellent set up...a group of young adults sets out to explore the catacombs below the city of Paris.  This is actually a premise that could be rooted in reality (like the setting of THE CHERNOBYL DIARIES).  And there are some early thrills in these explorations, although they also felt a little bit like poorly done rip-offs of better scenes in THE DESCENT.  We get plenty of creepy images, featuring hooded figures or weird groups of women.  And when things start going poorly, we can actually sort of believe these guys would keep moving forward because their ""leader"" is a driven archeaologist wanna-be (Perdita Weeks) who has already been shown to have a propensity for driving ahead regardless of the danger, like a reporter in war zone.  So her companions follow her just a bit blindly, until things are suddenly so bad, it's time to go back.  Only, of course, the trip back is not nearly as simple as the trip down the unexplored caves and hallways.

The film has atmosphere aplenty.  If you've got a surround-sound system, you should be quite impressed by the sound design.  Certainly a few jarring moments.

But there are real head-scratching moments and things left unresolved.  For example, for a good chunk of the film the main characters are joined by a mysterious man who was apparently a catacomb-explorer himself, but had disappeared quite some time ago.  Suddenly he appears, and it's clear (at least to the viewer) that this guy is not right in the head.  Then suddenly, he commits a horrible act and is abruptly gone, never to be mentioned or referenced again...despite what he did.  It's a creepy character with no-payoff or explanation.  Good setup...bad execution.

There is also some code-deciphering in the film (remember, the lead is a third-rate Indiana Jones) that makes no sense.  And in the end, many of the threads of the film are left unexplained in a particularly obvious way.  I think the film THINKS it has told us something, but in the blurry, hand-held filming and screams and frantic editing...something is lost.  Something like logic.

The director of the film made one of my guilty-pleasure favorites, QUARANTINE and showed much more skill and even gave us a real ending.  Nothing brilliant, but solid throughout, with some actual intelligent performances.  AS ABOVE, SO BELOW is a step backward.  Moderately entertaining overall, but I certainly cannot actually recommend it.",1438992000,,2922,5.035416666666666

6611968,2,B00N5AICVQ,"The thing about catacombs is that its dark and easy to lose ones way; which is exactly what this movie does.
It starts with promise young British archaeologist Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) believes shes found the secret to discovering the Philosophers Stone, an ancient mythical stone with healing properties, so she enlists her reluctant friend, linguist/anarchist handyman George (Ben Feldman) to help translate some Aramaic scribbling which reveal their destination to be beneath Paris. They get the help of a local group of urban explorers to find new paths amid the old bone-strewn catacombs to uncover the encrypted entrance; but there are, of course, greater and more malevolent secrets they will discover along the way.

Whats frustrating is that we start with a nifty little setup sequence in which Scarlett covertly infiltrates dangerous tombs in Iran that are about to be blown up, and its a thrilling few moments that nicely sets up her young Indiana Jonessa prowess and tenaciousness. The movie cuts to a supposed documentary being filmed about her, but does not carry that construct throughout, rather it uses it as the shaky camera POV crutch. I can take a lot of shake, but As Above So Below is stomach-churningly unfocused with the shake-cam thing and it becomes a huge distraction.

Once in the catacombs and off the touristed path, the movie conjures a few good eerie sequences that are never followed through; threads of psychological torture sputter and fall flat. There is allusion to some devilry and red glows portent a doorway to hell scenario that never materializes. An eerie cult chanting in some ancient tongue is completely dismissed, and we have obligatory evil looking hooded figures wandering about. We get dead Knights of the Templar and stone figures that come to life and freaky teases, but nothing coalesces into a narrative thread that sticks. When the bloody, dusty few survivors crawl out (upside down) through a sewer drain, we feel nothing but royalement trompe (royally cheated).

CLICHES: Ancient translations lead to hidden treasures! Archaeologist dads notebooks have all the right clues, people thought he was crazy!
SURPRISES: Heroine Perdita Weeks has promise with a better script; I nominate her to be on the short list for casting the new, younger reboot of Lara Croft (Tomb Raider).

It is also evident that the characters in the movie were created with passion and delicacy. The audience almost becomes inspired seeing that regardless of who or what tries to stop Scarlett and George, they maintain an impeccable level of determination to do what is needed and still care for each other at the same time.

This did not do very well critically, and I think that probably has some to do with the use of the beaten to death ""found footage"" style.  I don't need to see this style used again but I feel it worked well for this film.  It uses some of the cliches of horror that you might expect but I think it was done very well overall and even so, I haven't seen anything quite like this before.  It has a really interesting concept and although horror has an almost uplifting aspect buried in the plot I don't want to spoil any of the story by explaining further).  Its got a pretty good ominous horror feel, including a few really strange and daring plot points that could have easily been terribly overdone but were handled very nicely and worked very well.  It also has a sort of exploration feel that might catch the interest of the curious adventurers out there.  It deals with some fairly cliche concepts of alchemy and 'occult' in a somewhat original manner, but again I want to avoid spoiling anything.
I am not sure what some people disliked so much  about this film but i think its definitely worth a watch for horror fans and fans of adventure films that don't mind them being dark and having horror/occult elements rather than the usual more cheery PG sort.  Not the scariest film I've seen by any measure but the horror/darkness was good and the atmosphere gets an A grade from me.

An extremely well-educated (though perhaps too impulsive) woman follows a series of clues from Iran to Paris in search of the alchemical Philosopher's Stone. The search leads her into the catacombs beneath Paris and much deeper, into a nightmarish place where things steadily fall further and further out of control.
All said, it was one of the best found footage flicks I have seen. It wasn't entirely predictable (which was a nice touch), the acting was better than the standard quality from this sort of movie, and the story was actually quite interesting.",1432944000,,831,4.818181818181818

There are aspects of The Pyramid, Blair Witch Project, The Ruins, The Descent and The Cave here but nothing more. I kept hoping for a great ending but instead had many questions unanswered and got a schmaltzy ending. This is okay but not anything new.",1432080000,2,532,4.438775510204081
6612012,3,B00N5AICVQ,"Looks like I owe my 10th grade English teacher an apology (*sigh*). I swore up and down that reading Dante's Inferno was a complete waste of time. When am I EVER going to use that again, right? And...here I am, 20 years later - and it's 'Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here' all over again. Man, I hate being wrong!

And who knew Nicolas Flamel was an actual person? I thought he was a figment of J.K. Rowling's imagination! (C'mon - I can't be the ONLY person who heard Nicolas Flamel and immediately thought of Harry Potter!)

There are loads of point-by-point summaries of this movie already, so I'll just add my two cents:

YAY - the archaeology/Dante angle was interesting. It's a bit of a mad jumble between the history of the catacombs under Paris, the mythology surrounding alchemy, and the idea of confronting your personal demons - but at least there was an actual plot and reason for them to be in the catacombs in the first place.

YAY - the acting was surprisingly good. I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, but I thought they did a great job at making it seem real. After all, that's the whole point of found-footage films: believability. I'm not claustrophobic, but Benji's panic attack certainly made my hands go sweaty, so kudos to him! And, as an atmospheric horror movie, it works. Other have compared it to The Descent, and it does have that 'trapped miles underground and the lights could go out any second' kind of panicked feel to it.

YAY - the camera usage was also surprisingly good. I've watched a lot of found footage movies, and they can be tricky to do well, especially if multiple cameras are used. The shakiness & odd angles need to create suspense, otherwise they just annoy people. The audience needs to be able to follow who is holding which camera, otherwise they just end up confused. And for heavens sake - when the camera gets dirty, there needs to be a clever way to get it clean...fast! As far as this film goes - check, check, and check. This is one of the better found-footage movies I've seen - both for technique and content.

BOO - it isn't remotely scary. Creepy, yes, especially if you're at all claustrophobic. However, as far as a spooky, supernatural thriller - it falls completely flat. Maybe if you've never seen a horror movie before, then you might jump a few times. But there wasn't a single original idea when it came to the chills & thrills. I'm sure someone has already made a list of all the ways they ripped off OTHER horror movies, and I'm sure it's a pretty long list. I spent the entire last half hour of the movie saying, ""Oh, that's from...""

BOO - it's a long, slow buildup to...not much of anything. The entire first hour is a lot of wandering around just to build on the mythology. Personally, I got the metaphor, so the ending made sense to me and I could appreciate the mind-bender aspect. But when all was said and done, it was just...meh. The movie managed to hold my attention throughout, but just barely. And when the ""scary"" finally arrived, it just wasn't. All that build up for - at best - a mildly trippy ending.

It's worth seeing if you have a soft spot found-footage thrillers. I'm glad I rented this, though, rather than buying. Even with that incredibly hot French guy, I still don't think I'd want to see this movie more than once.",1431907200,,3320,4.503322259136213
6612013,2,B00N5AICVQ,"One of the worst movies I have ever wasted my time on.  First of all,  I did not buy this movie through Amazon,  but got it from my Netflix subscription.  Now to the movie.  When the movie first started and it was shown as a real docudrama type of film, with one guy holding a camera and following around the main character of the movie,  I already knew right there and then that this movie was going to be a real waste of my time.  Sure enough......The acting and the story was really bad....Then only good thing about the movie is that it shows Paris, and love that city.  There are some tense moments, but for the whole is a very cheaply made horror movie, similar to those make believe reality horror films we have seen in the recent past.

The movie does basically zero character development so they could have just made her an urban spelunker obsessed with the stone bc of her dad. It just makes no sense to write her character in such an unbelievable contradictory way when it wasn't even necessary to the plot.

The metaphysical aspects of the story (philosopher's stone, alchemy, esoteric occult philosophy) was integrated in a deep way into the structure of the film and of the fabric of the Paris underground. It was much more intelligent than most horror films ever try to be. Whereas so many horror films fail when they reveal the monster at the end, this film exceeds expectation. The last quarter of the underground were genuinely original and terrifying and the ending was perfection. There were several spots where I jumped/screamed, which is unusual for me since I've seen so many horror films.

I love the mysterious ""Indiana Jones-like"" archaeological hunting for clues and deciphering symbolism. Marion Lambert (who plays Souxie), is a totally unique hottie (unusual, down-to-earth and spicy)! Francois Civil plays his part brilliantly- highly knowledgeable/adventurous/sarcastic Frenchman, yet still concerned/sensitive to the well-being of others. The story builds suspense with mysterious discoveries, glimpses upon European nightlife, lures the audience into the adventure and then deeper and deeper into the varied catacombs of fear (incorporating the bonus of treasure hunting).

Some may complain that that means poor lighting, heads being chopped off, etc. That's just how this genre works and if it doesn't bother you then give it a try. After having seen hundreds or horror films and probably a couple hundred more thrillers, I can say that very few are actually scary. This is not a horrifying, give you nightmares for years films. However, the acting is strong and they work well with some jump-scenes as well as fleeting around the corner images that get your blood pumping. They don't have ""throw in your face"" over-the-top horror, which I greatly appreciate. With horror films, less is more. What is the best about this film is that they use true historical data, actual facts, mythology and archaeology. I like that they didn't make up whatever they wanted to make this film, they used actual history and that makes it a lot stronger.

So, all in all, this is not one of the strongest horror films I have ever seen. But, overall, they play to their strengths well. If you are looking for a film that is sort of a horror based National Treasure (just with the philosopher's stone, not monetary treasure), strong acting and subtle horror, you should be just fine with this one.",1424822400,,1303,4.665217391304348

6612264,5,B00N5AICVQ,"This is long, but no major spoilers are revealed.

This 2014 indie film didt get any love at the recent film award festivals, and in this case I feel it was slighted.  Most likely because its basically a horror film and they never do get any respect, except in their own, horror-specific festivals.  The entire genre occupies some nether region, consciously or at least unconsciously in the minds of film critics somewhere far, far below science fiction or fantasy films.  Perhaps they are the film equivalent of a lesbian woman of color in Americaseverely misunderestimated and looking very little like the extremely white and male US Senate, or a large corporate CEO gathering, the membership at the Augusta Golf Club, etc

Note I didn't say this is a SLASHER movie.  No, its a proper horror film, which means if it DOES make you jump or wince or tense up in your seat at all, it is not via graphically depicted violence or gore.  Nor, thank God, is it yet another found footage variant, which got old approximately 24 hours after Blair Witch Project left the theatres and at this point I think requires at least a 50 year total ban before it ever looks interesting again.
Not that it isn't (sadly) opposed to some horror-film stock-in-trade such as: darkness used to enhance the feeling of dread, briefly-glimpsed creepy scenes, and the ubiquitous use of two particularly obnoxious phrases: Its OK [when, clearly, things are VERY MUCH NOT OK], and Be careful! like that will somehow prevent the occurrence of totally unpredictable events, when events have already proven themselves to be very unpredictable.  Yeah surewe already have a cave-in or two behind us, fell down shafts well never get up again, and periodically seem to get attacked by things out of nowhere but yeah, ILL BE CAREFUL!  Because Im sure that THEN, itll BE OK!

Now that I got the worst parts out, theres a lot to like here.  It starts out like an action movie with a lot of philosophy and symbolism.  The main character, Scarlett, is an Oxford antiquarian following in her fathers footsteps in the study of alchemy and the history of the search for the Philosophers Stone, a substance (a catalyst) which can convert baser metals into gold.  She adds to it the ability to grant immortality [in other traditions, that is granted by the Fountain of Youth or elixir of life].  Alchemists searched for this and also for a universal solvent, a substance which could dissolve all other substances.  Lucky perhaps they didn't discover it because it would be AWFULLY HARD TO STORE IT ANYWHERE, WOULDNT IT?  The alchemists failed in their basic missions, but along the way discovered several of what we now call elements, created quite a few interesting molecules [like hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the really nasty hydrofluoric acid] and eventually gave rise to modern chemistry.
The movie mixes a huge amount of symbolism from different cultures to have us believe that one great charlatan alchemist, Nicholas Flamel who was buried in Paris, France, actually succeeded in creating the Philosophers stone but took the knowledge with him to death (if he really died).  Her father was on Flamels trail when he died, and the daughter continues the search.

Scarlett finds one clue in a sealed-off cave in Iran: something that looked rather like a stone carving of a minotaur, but could be any black stone cow-like creature with a lot of inscriptions.

She goes to Paris looking for the help of another researcher who can read Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) which she cannot even though she does speak 4 living languages and 2 dead ones [presumably Latin and Greek].  Her friend agrees to translate for her, but wants no part of her crazy adventures, as last time he ended up in a Turkish jail by accompanying her [naturally, he comes along anyway].

She also hires on a filmographer to document her efforts, and they are directed by a mysterious person to find a man named Papillon in a French caf.  After some dialog, Papillon and 2 sidekicks agree that yes, actually they know the catacombs under Paris pretty wellQUITE WELL, in fact.  Her friend Georges reading of the Aramaic and their deciphering of its symbolism has convinced them that the Philosophers stone must be buried in the catacombs of Paris, some 360 feet below city level (because the ancients, just as they believed the age of the earth to be 4,000-some years, also thought they had a fairly precise calculation how far below the earths surface HELL was, something like 741 feetshe has concluded the Philosophers stone is halfway between the surface and that distance

Counting Scarlett, George, the filmographer and the 3 catacomb-lovers makes a party of six about to get in way above their heads (or perhaps I should say below their feet?)

What adds to the films initial credibility and mystique is its ability to throw around so many symbols and ideas that really were IMPORTANT to fairly smart people in bygone centuries: all the alchemical research; ancient Egyptian symbolism; Aramaic; the character Nicholas Flamel, the Knights Templar, Dantes Inferno, and on and onYou could watch this film several times and each time, come up with new ideas as to the meanings.

More cool stuff:  it REALLY WAS filmed in the catacombs below the city of Paris, France.  And the catacombs REALLY DO contain the bones and remains of an estimated SIX MILLION PEOPLEabout 3 times as many people as the living there now.  And its likely nobody knows the full extent of the catacombs and their history.  This was the first film permitted to use the catacombs as a set.

The sound is Dolby 3-D and the visual quality worthy of Blu-Ray (when it doesnt get all dark on you].

At a key part of the film Scarlett discovers one of many ancient depictions, which she declares in a short monolog that it represents As Above, So Below and proceeds to interpret that as meaning quite a bit more than the conventional religious notion, represented in the Lords prayer Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven, or even the more Platonic idea that the earthly forms we see are but imperfect metaphors for a non-physical world of the true, ideal forms.  She also interprets it to mean As within, So without: that as is her mind, so are all the cells in her body, and so is the outside world and so is God; that in fact as she believes the outside world to be, so it is.  But she turns from that to a very practical application: a false door in the ceiling indicates a real but hidden door under the water below their feet (which she finds).

The closer they get to the Philosophers Stone, the more weird things become, and the more the deepest fears and regrets of each one of the crew are played out in the external world.
When they finally do get to what she believes is the location of the long-lost stone, her guides, distracted by gold treasure they see just beyond an iron gate, are busy pounding open the gate to reach their worldly treasure.  Too late, she yells that it is  TRAPthat the philosophers stone was the real treasure.  Sadly she was right: the ceiling collapses, and though none of them are killed by that event, now they are DEFINITELY not returning the way they came, which was looking extremely unlikely anyhow.  She figures there must have been some kind of back door for just this kind of contingency.  The only thing she can find leads still further down, and has inscribed [in Aramaic] the famous words on the gates of Hell in Dantes Inferno: Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.  Not exactly the most favorable omen, but they DO have the philosophers stone, right?  They proceed.  Stuff happens.  The ending is interesting; perhaps ambiguous.  You can watch this several times and keep finding new ideas in it.
Good subtitling is available in a variety of European Languages as well as English.
The special features on the Blu-Ray are quite sparse, but there was an interesting 3 minute conversation about what it was like to film in the catacombs under Paris for several weeks (in a word, creepy).
Despite some flaws this is a thinking persons horror film.  The last ones I liked this much came out several years ago and are entirely different other than being equally well-made: Believers and Take Shelter  I give this a solid B",1422576000,,8288,4.7355601948503825

6612274,4,B00N5AICVQ,"I FINALLY got around to watching this.  The fact it was the first (and only?) movie actually allowed to be shot IN the real catacombs under Paris was intriguing.

While not entirely unique in the sub plots, it is a pretty good watch.  Think ""Event Horizon in Catacombs"" and you have the right idea.

The first reel is what puts the movie squarely into view and sets it apart from other typical ""scary s*** in a cave"" movies.  The second reel keeps you hooked, building a good sense of dread and playing with story elements a bit.  Finally, the last reel locks down the action and death toll with a so-so ending but not one that will necessarily piss you off.

I'd give it a solid 7.5 or 8 because it was overall well done and kept me hooked and interested (even scared a couple of times - although the scares were mostly predictable).  Had the movie not heavily borrowed elements (or if I wasn't so old to have SEEN all those said movies) it could have easily moved up to an 8.5 or 9.

If you have a bit of claustrophobia or have ever been exploring in a real cave (or abandoned mine like me) the movie will rub you uncomfortably close sometimes - and that's a good thing.",1422057600,,1172,4.290909090909091

The basic idea for the film was great.  Hidden passages below the streets of Paris that could lead to the most important find in the history of mankind.  Yeah, that got my attention in a big way.

The problem for me was in the way the movie was shot by the camera man or Director of Photography.  The extremely fast camera moves literally made me dizzy and sick to my stomach.  This is why I don't go to see 3-D films at the theater.  I feel like I'm going to throw up the popcorn after thirty-to-forty minutes.

That, plus what the explorers find below Paris, didn't make a lot sense.  Of course, I didn't get to the end of the movie, either.  I wanted to be scared and I wasn't.  I was only made sick.

Most of the acting seemed to be okay.  I didn't recognize any of the performers, but they appeared to be giving it their all and attempted to make things as realistic as possible.

With a documentarian, a translator of ancient languages, and a trio of tour guides, she descends into a world none of them are prepared for. I fell in love with this movie by the twenty-minute mark, and it continued to hold my interest throughout. There is one very notable inconsistency, where a direct translation from Aramaic to English is a rhyming riddle. How does that work? It's my biggest complaint with the movie. And it's a very small one. While character development is slight at best, we're not subjected to annoying or unlikable characters, and that's a huge plus for me in the FF genre.

6612308,4,B00N5AICVQ,"Right away, we're introduced to Scarlett, basically a female Indiana Jones. Her father taught her everything she knows and she tries to follow his footsteps after his suicide.

The film starts out with an awesome sequence underground with Scarlett looking for a missing piece of history that would show the location of the Philosopher's Stone, a fabled stone of alchemy which would grant the bearer immortality as well as the power of resurrection. Right after finding the Rose Key, the missing piece, Scarlett is almost blown up.

She gathers a team to go underground in the Catacombs under Paris to find the stone. That's when stuff gets real. Like, amazingly real. If you have any knowledge of mythology, biblical things, or the occult, you should love some of the stuff they showcase. Basically, Dante's Inferno brought to the screen mixed with some other stuff. It would appear that a lot of research went into this but it would appear some, or a lot, was cut from the film. There's a guy in the Catacombs near the beginning who shows up in a car later but isn't really explained.

That's why I'm giving this a 4. I love this movie and have watched it about 5 times now. I really like the mythology and horror elements but I just can't get past some of the stuff in it.

Starts out as an interesting idea about finding a magic artifact within the catacombs below Paris, but quickly devolves into tiresome, shaky-cam first person footage of people running around screaming.  It was like watching one of thoses moronic ghost hunter type tv shows where everyone looks into the camera to show how scared they are.

I can't figure out why this type of film is so popular - all it does is illustrate that the director has no idea how to properly tell a story cinematically.  You know what does nothing to hide poor directing? The combination of worse writing and casting.. Two early twenty-somethings who have supposedly been on numerous adventures in other countries for years, with one ending up in a turkish prison? What were they, four when they started?  A twenty something with two doctorates, who is a krav maga expert, continually making bad decisions, ridiculous guesses and leaps of faith, and others are still willing to put themselves in danger for her?  Right..

This movie made no sense whatsoever, because it couldn't decide if it was supposed to be found footage, or an actual film.  When they go into the catacombs, it's established that they are all wearing cameras on their heads, but there were a ton of scenes that made no sense, because none of them could have been filming.  Also, about 100 of the most convenient coincidences ever to keep the story moving.  Just ridiculous...

What really made this frustrating though was that when it's finally all over (and 1 1/2 hours has never seemed so long) there is an amazing credit sequence that puts the movie itself to shame.",1420848000,,1678,4.856140350877193

I don't really care if everything wasn't perfect and made entirely logical, because frankly the movies I've seen lately that have done that have been complete bores as well.  Glad to see an actually entertaining movie with an eerie structure.

6612316,4,B00N5AICVQ,"Apparently, I'm claustrophobic... because there were moments while I was watching 'As Above So Below' that I couldn't take it anymore. My breathing became shallow, my heart sped up, and I had to hit pause. I don't care about heights. I'd skydive in a second; but spelunking scares the hell out of me. 'The Descent' -- Neil Marshall's modern horror classic about a group of intrepid young women who confront a monstrous, troglodytic evolutionary off-shoot of humanity in an unexplored cave system -- had a similar effect on me. The troglodytes weren't as terrifying as watching the women work their way through a tunnel barely big enough for their bodies, taking sudden twists and turns, with no idea whether or not the tunnel would suddenly get too narrow to continue, or become unstable and collapse. The prospect of being crushed is nothing compared to becoming stuck, wedged in tight, no way forward and no way back, solid rock in every direction. No hope of rescue. A quick death would be a welcome thing, but even that is out of reach; there's no way to avoid a long, agonizing end by way of dehydration or starvation.

If those scenes didn't strike you as frightening, or you're one of the crazy men and women who watched 'The Descent' and then went shopping for spelunking gear -- I'm impressed. You're gifted/afflicted with an uncommon bravery, or... a complete and utter lack of imagination.

'As Above, So Below' has scenes that actually surpass 'The Descent' in terms of claustrophobic nightmares, so prepare for some very intense moments. The story revolves around a driven young women's search for the fabled 'Philosopher's Stone', a quest that takes her and a small group of explorers into the Necropolis -- a system of centuries-old catacombs beneath Paris, an ossuary that is home to the skeletal remains of over 6 000 000 people.

This is a 'found footage' movie, a device that has become very familiar to horror fans. Unlike so many of these awful 'FF' tales -- 'Crowsnest' would be a perfect example -- 'As Above, So Below' is ambitious, well-produced, and uses the intimacy of the format as a way of increasing emotional impact, instead of a cheap, easy shortcut for 'film-makers' with a complete absence of talent, story and funding.

The protagonist, Scarlett, is accompanied by a documentarian named Benji and a reluctant friend and fellow scholar, George; when a previous excursion in Turkey ended with George locked up in one of their notorious jails, Scarlett abandoned him to his fate. He has a fear of caves relating to a childhood tragedy, but Scarlett needs him for his skills as a translator... and fate intervenes, in the form of the local police, yet again. She also seeks out a group of Parisians who are expert 'urban spelunkers', and know the catacombs better than anyone; the cocky butterfly, 'Papillon', brings his super-cool crew. They're in it for the treasure. They're also very trusting of pretty English gals with crazy-f***ing-stories and treasure-maps.

Following extremely unhelpful clues left by the alchemist Nicholas Flamel, Scarlett and George make some ridiculously intuitive leaps in logic, leading them into a Da Vinci Code-brand treasure hunt into the mouth of hell. 'AASB' could have been one of the best horror films of the decade, but it is dragged down by the kind of narrative flaws that so often afflict horror films. As it is, this is still one of the most entertaining and occasionally terrifying films of the year. Seeing as how we're only one week into 2015, that's not overly impressive, but I still highly recommend this movie for horror fans... as long as they have forgiveness in their heart. It has the silly, insulting moments you just have to forget about; when Scarlett asks George to translate a secret message in ancient Aramaic (on the reverse of a tremendously valuable stone tablet, which is completely unprotected from both the ravages of time and single-minded treasure hunters), he immediately interprets it as perfectly rhyming verse. Trying to translate a passage of highly symbolic language -- it's a riddle, with several layers of meaning, after all -- from a dialect as different from English as Aramaic, is difficult enough; but trying to balance accuracy with RHYMING COUPLETS is virtually impossible. But... the rhyme makes it recognizable as Flamel's 'Key' to the various traps and puzzles that protect the Philosopher's Stone, so the writer decided to ignore the silliness of such a feat. It also seems highly improbable that an overeducated Mary Sue like Scarlett, inheritor of a multigenerational obsession with alchemical grails, would have no knowledge of Aramaic.

As an aside, I hate alchemists. Maybe caution and secrecy were necessary for truth-seekers in a time and place where intellectual discovery was so strictly censored by the Catholic church; and the artwork they created, in the form of beautifully engraved illustrations dense and rich with cryptic symbolism, is impressive; but the manner in which they squirreled away their knowledge, spending more time on obscuring, occulting and obfuscating than they ever did on truth-seeking, seems unjustifiable relative to their total failures, philosophically and scientifically. Also, I didn't find the parallel's to Dante's Inferno all that obvious, other than the fact that the film follows characters into hell; Neither 'Butterfly' nor 'Mole' are particularly Virgil-like, and this hell isn't divided into nine distinct 'circles'. Maybe all the spontaneous alchemical verse was too distracting.

'As Above, So Below', on the other hand, makes some mistakes, but none of them are close to fatal. Even the predictable, lazy conclusion didn't diminish my enthusiasm for the terror that writer-director John Erick Dowdle was able to generate in the catacombs under Paris. I haven't been so overwhelmed by claustrophobic terror in the real world, let alone watching a movie; that in itself is a feat worth mentioning (I'm keeping this spoiler-free, so I'll just say that the scene involving a tunnel just big enough to crawl through, an unstable ceiling above, splintered human bones below... nicely done). But there are plenty of other frightening moments, many of them quite original, if you don't find the idea of being buried in an ancient Necropolis intimidating.

NOTE: For whatever reason, positive reviews are getting blanket down-voted. Sometimes Amazon is hilarious. Frequently, Amazon is hilarious. Of all the stupid f***ing movies that get 5-star reviews, THIS is the one some idiots decide to get pissy about? It's got some really dumb moments, and it's far from high art, but it's also pretty entertaining. Whatever. And for those reviewers who somehow missed the repeated in-film explanations, each character has their own camera attached to their headlamp. Perspectives shift from camera to camera. By making the camera a part of their gear -- their most important tool underground, a lightsource -- it doesn't seem ridiculous that someone completely f***ing terrified is still filming.",1420761600,10,7052,5.136759581881533

6612340,4,B00N5AICVQ,"as with most horror films , seeing this at a movie theater is much more effective than on your tiny tv. It was very effective and spooky there. Of course on tv you see a little screen in front of you instead of a giant one that adds to the picture. I would say that as much as I love my home theater if you are not going to the movies then you are missing out , especially concerning horror films. This one is a found footage type of movie. These are NOT my favorite type of horror films but we get several a year. Ever since the classic 'blair witch project' came out in 1999 that is. This one takes place deep in the catacombs beneath Paris and it's scary but also not as gory as it could have been. The blu ray is a good version of the film with a great picture. the acting is effective and this is a higher budget than most found footage films by a long shot So that is a plus here.",1420502400,,886,3.9277777777777776

Love the idea of the catacombs below Paris, and the idea of the Gates of Hell. Those are some very adult and real ideas that hit home with people. My only complaint really was the ending.

When she said she had a black belt in Krav Maga I nearly doubled over in pain because my stomach muscles were being overworked due to the guffaws that were belching forth from my gullet. This is the most hilarious film since Crash by Paul Haggis. The filmmakers here must've collaborated with Haggis anonymously because the tone is eerily, and side-splittingly, similar.

6612468,3,B00N5AICVQ,"First the good. The acting (and casting) of this movie was superior by far to what you see in most horror movies. The characters were believable and well-played by the cast. The characters weren't rote stereotypes except for the brilliant yet gorgeous lead, but her acting made up for the typecasting. In fact, I added a star based on the strength of the cast.

Also good....the setting was properly atmospheric, moody, believable, claustrophobic at times, it fit the theme of the movie very well. The setting was an equal contributor to my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. It was creepy, but before things got too weird you could imagine the sense of adventure you would feel if you were doing the exploring.

The plot lost me a time or two during the setup, but no big deal. I got the general idea and the plot wasn't ludicrous, just rather immaterial to getting the cast underground. We're really getting close to a horror classic here guys! The elements are all in place.

The bad? Sigh....it just wasn't scary. The ""scary"" parts reminded me of costumed people jumping out of the shadows in a well done Halloween haunted house, with maybe a quick shot of a weird looking kid no one sees, or a spooky and slightly menacing figure walking past a character unseen in the background. What tenseness you feel during the movie comes more from the cast doing a great job and the well-designed sets (especially the ""Abandon all hope"" scene). When actual ""monsters"" threaten, well....you just don't feel all that threatened. I was left with a feeling that with all the good in place, a director like James Wan could have produced a classic.  Instead we get the ""ah, not bad"" that As Above, So Below offers.",1419033600,4,1703,4.666666666666667

This is readily to be found beneath the streets of Paris. However, this hodgepodge of mystery, history and mythology lacks much in the way of development and the herky jerky camera work and editing moves so quickly that even the subtitles can't keep up. I had to watch it that way the second time around because there was so much yelling and screaming going on that it was nigh on impossible to make out what anyone was yelling about.
Relentless shouting; people running hither and thither; miraculous healing; stone mummies; personal demons, it's got the lot...except style, plot, dramatic effect, believable characters, strong direction...and ""Abandon hope ..."" is from Dante, not mythology. Have I missed anything?

6612481,3,B00N5AICVQ,"I like caves.  I like scary movies.  I thought this would be a fun combination of the two.  When the characters met to go into the Catacombs to look for the Philosopher's Stone (look at Hogwarts) and the girls show up wearing off the shoulder sweaters, t-shirts, and boots, the guys show up in street clothes, you know it isn't going to end well, and I actually hoped they would all die because of their sheer stupidity.  From taking cave tours at Silver Dollar City, even I have learned that you never go into a cave without multiple flashlights, warm clothes, or telling someone you are going into a cave and when to expect you back.

Using several hints from a notebook given to the main character, she is off to find this stone.  She starts by handling the tombstone of Nicholas Flamel, which isn't even stored in a climate controlled case.  She takes it down and gathers her clues using her ex-boyfriend's language knowledge.  She jots this info in her Notebook, takes it in her Backpack, and heads for her Adventure.  She and her friends begin to figure out the answers to all the questions involved in finding the stone, just like Dora the Explorer, and end up in a creepy place that is lit with torches and has surfaces that look way to smooth and perfect to be made by the same people who just used big rocks to make the rest of the Catacombs.

Anyway, not to spoil anything, this movie actually has some fun jump scares, and some creepy scenes.  Plus if you are claustrophobic, don't watch it.  If you are totally bored and need something to do, watch this movie.  Just ignore the stupid parts.",1418688000,11,1604,4.489655172413793

I am giving this movie a 2.5 because as dark as it was and what seemed like an endless maze which was what I was loving was suddenly explained away in the end as the survivors had to face their demons in order to escape.  Yea right.

This was not one of those times. There aren't many scary movies that have made me actually jump in the last decade, however this is the first one that has been able to do it in probably 7 or 8 years. This is sort of a Paris-meets-Indiana Jones- meets-Blair Witch-meets-National Treasure movie.

No. Enjoyable flick in a genre tending to produce movies as though Hollywood producers sat around a table and agreed to spew them from the same mould that year.

It's cheap enough as a rental now or wait until it's on Prime.",1418515200,,379,4.573529411764706
6612495,3,B00N5AICVQ,"I gotta say first off, the trailer made this film look really awesome, but after seeing it, I should just give 5 stars to the editor of the trailer for making it look like it was a far better film than it turned out to be.

AASB is about a woman who is a archeologist and blah blah we've heard that back story a million times before. She is in search of The Rosetta Stone and The Philosopher Stone. (No reference to Double Dragon III or Harry Potsmoker), something her father was looking for before he went mad and killed himself, now she is trying to complete his work. She takes off to a middle eastern country and sneaks into an underground cave system where she discovers a hidden statue that looks like Horace (Egyptian Mythology) and it has some sort of message on it that leads her back to the tombstone of some famous guy found in France (meh whatever). After doing some Indiana Jones work, she discovers another message that says the Rosetta Stones are 747 feet underground or something? Apparently it's the number of the devil... I always though that was 666, but not this time around.

She figures if she's going to get down that low beneath the city, there must be a hidden tomb somewhere in the catacomb chambers. She enlists the help of some people who know every inch of the catacombs except the parts they think is evil and they embark on their journey to find these secret rooms. Obviously they find a way in, so that's not a spoiler, and along the way they begin to discover the areas no one has been in for a few hundred years. However they are not alone. Something else is down there with them as some creepy and spooky things begin to happen, like shadows, ghosts, mysterious things from their past re-emerging... and of coarse, you probably guessed it... they're lost and have no idea where they're going or how to get back out.

Overall... it was a decent film until the last 20 minutes or so when it just turned on it's head and pulled it's pants down to moon the audience and blow a raspberry directly at the camera. It's like a really decent script was half completed, or a 3rd of the way, and someone said lets begin filming and just come up with an ending on the spot when we get to it. It's a shame, because this had intentional to be a great little horror-ish version of Goonies and Indiana Jones in a more realistic approach, but then just bent itself over in the end and ^%$#@ it and relied too much on loud noise jump scares instead of trying to be smart about what could have made this film better.",1418428800,2,2532,4.371549893842888

6612506,4,B00N5AICVQ,"An admirable tweak to the found footage genre. The hearty heap of occult homework that the writer(s) of this film obviously researched in order to make this film paid off in spades. The main character started strong and interesting, only diminishing slightly as the movie neared its conclusion. As a horror fan I have to note that I wanted more hell, but oh well, what hell they brought here is still pretty interesting. The parisian catacombs are fascinating, as always. None of the characters are especially stupid, though all of them suffer the common, if forgivable trope of disregarding unexplainable phenomena for the sake of brevity within a scene.

6612514,4,B00N5AICVQ,"This is the first horror movie in a while that made me feel genuinely uncomfortable and anxious, so I give it props for that. Probably won't work for people not afraid of tight spaces and darkness, but those are common phobias, so it has a broad audience.

This comes off as a ""found footage"" film, but it's really more of a POV movie - they dispense with the bulls*** you usually see in found-footage like shaky cam, blurry shots, ""why are you still filming?"", etc. This is, like I said, really more of a POV movie - the only time they play with the fact that the cameras are head-mounted is when the characters are going through some disorienting s*** and the director wants the viewer to feel the same disorientation. Also, they have a neat trick that I give props for - when s*** gets real and the characters are being banged around, the cameras get a bit choppy - it really adds to the intensity of the moment.

Without spoiling anything, I was a little disappointed by the ending, but only because I was hoping for something more like the end of Mirrors. Some of the final moments are also a bit contrived and a bit cliche, and horror movies shouldn't steal from Kung Fu Panda...just sayin' >_>

Still, a good, claustrophobic movie and a good example of the RIGHT way to make a movie from the POV of cameras being operated by the characters.",1418083200,,1347,4.445344129554656

Some of the special effects will garner a ""give me a break!"" from experienced genre fans.  The adverts are creepier than the scares they advertise.  Still, it is a must see.

Then something happened on the screen but I couldn't tell what it was. I reversed the movie two times to watch the scene over. Then, I started paying more attention. So, it starts slow but gets a lot better.

Archeologists, educated in ancient texts, find clues in some catacombs but have trouble getting back inside to explore. They hire a guide that knows a ""secret way"" and they embark on a mission to find possible treasure. After getting into the tunnels, the movie becomes POV. If you want to find out what they encounter you will have to watch the movie.

For a mostly POV type movie(which I normally hate), the filming and sound are very good. The acting is much better than the majority of these type movies. The female lead is great in the tunnels but above ground she is does a very poor job.

This is a well done scary/thriller. It got my attention and I watched til the very end. At one point, I even jumped, yelled and the cat went running. Once the action starts, it's pretty much non-stop til the end.

6612544,3,B00N5AICVQ,"As above, so below as I believe the world to be, so it is. Scarlett (Weeks) is searching for the philosophers stone and thinks she has finally found the resting place of it. She puts together a crew and heads to the catacombs beneath the streets of Paris. What they end up finding is something no one is prepared for. This is a difficult movie to review. The idea of a type of horror Indiana Jones/National Treasure is great. This starts off very strong and the fact that they actually filmed in the catacombs beneath Paris gave this found footage more of a reality based feel. The real downfall and problem with the movie is the horror aspect. The horror of the movie is really nothing more than jump scare after jump scare. Normally that isn't a terrible thing but in this movie it just doesnt make sense. You watch the interesting aspect of the explorers trying to figure out the symbols they find and then from out of nowhere someone jumps at the camera, then the exploring continues. The horror would have been better if it was done more suspenseful like The Cave rather than having it feel like an afterthought. Overall, a very neat idea that was ruined by the jump-scares that never seemed to fit. I give this a B.",1417392000,2,1221,4.479820627802691

This movie makes no sense! Here is the general outline and my problems with it: If you get to hell, you get haunted by your sins from above, however in this movie most of the characters don't get haunted by sins that they are connected to.  This movie was a really interesting idea, but very poorly executed, such a shame! I also did not find it scary in the least, the movie was a little long and drawn out, then in the last half hour or so the whole movie goes turbo speed killing any suspense that they had built up.

6612553,4,B00N5AICVQ,"I went into this movie with lower standards expecting it to take advantage of every little moment to get the scream factor, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by this movie. If you're more of a modern generation mind set where you have to have action and it needs to be now, then this probably isn't for you. The movie took on a retro horror movie feel with the slower start, the build of suspense and curiosity then the last half hour of the movie has your eyes glued to the screen and your brain engaged at all times. Its defiantly a movie that makes you think, and I am someone who thoroughly enjoys that.  While it did have those common features of Indiana jones, they were only skin deep. In this movie, no one really gets the girl, no Nazis die, and there is no happy go lucky sense of adventure. This movie takes you to good feeling adventure, to questioning, to hope, to desperation, to hope again, brings in some screams, and leaves you with a what in the name of hades just happened? To I now understand... So if you're looking for a good horror movie and you are patient then I would suggest this. Just brace yourself for those last 30 minutes.",1417132800,2,1160,4.37037037037037

 In short, this is what an archeology movie should be! Even the documentary type camera work actually worked in this films favor, which is something that doesn't always go over well. I think it allowed for the...

...ahem, certain sequences to be pulled off more effectively.

 I think the actors did a well enough job, certain emotions could have been conveyed better, fear, despair, regret, and sorrow, to name a few, but in the end, they did not ruin the film, not by a long shot.

 And as an offering, I will say that this has a certain Lovecraftian slant to it, with a touch of Jung.

It is my hope and prayer that a para-military group covertly mobilizes to find them and kill them, returning their young captives to civilization for medical and psychiatric therapies.  Many of these children and young adults will not recover, will remain hopelessly insane.  ""As above, so below"" goes claw-in-claw with another of their axioms""  ""Do what you will.""  I had hoped this movie would probe this terrible reality, but it does not.  The producers and the players either lack the brains or the balls to do so, opting instead for a clichd exploitation of our altogether natural fear of claustrophobia, blah blah.  There have been quite tenuous but well-executed attempts to expose these monsters, ""Kill List"" and the remarkable ""True Detective.""

I was expecting your typical scare-your-pants-off horror movie with lots of fake blood and most, if not all, of the characters dying. Well, without giving too much away I will say the finale was unexpected, but I was thoroughly satisfied with it. The effects weren't overbearing and I would have to say that it was more equal parts mystery and suspense. Definitely had me on the edge of my bed, biting my nails at parts, but it was a thrill ride that one can actually enjoy. I thought that most of the actors did a great job and the story line was definitely interesting (Aka- there actually was a good story line to go with the horror/suspense). If you like these kinds of thrillers I would definitely recommend it, and don't judge it by any of the trailers. Also if you get spooked easily, I think that the scare scenes in this movie are pretty moderate in frequency considering other horror movies, but it's still a spooky good time!

If you're claustrophobic, you best skip on past as you are underground in the catacombs 80% of the time.  I am not fond of tight places which contributed to my feeling a sense of panic quite a bit.  The puzzle that they continued to solve kept me intrigued.  Don't let the fact that it's filmed in Paris deter you - it's not a subtitled movie....in fact there are English-speaking actors making up the main cast of 5, who all did a remarkable job with an intricate web of detail, suspense and oh yea, lets not forget the horror......oh, the horror.

6612564,2,B00N5AICVQ,"I would actually give this movie a 2.5, but that's not possible and it just wasn't good enough for me to give it a score of 3, therefore it gets a 2. I would describe this movie as, ""Taking a shaky roller coaster ride deep inside a dirty dark abandoned Mine shaft sparsely decorated in creepy and, as you get on and off this ride for approximately 1 hour and 34 minutes you are trying to understand exactly why you are on this roller coaster in this Mine in the first place and then you go home slightly nauseated.

Basically there is a story in this movie, not new or innovative, but decent although with all the shaky video they don't make it easy to pick up on the clues and link them together so the viewer can understand why, what, where, when, how, which is essential in order to make this movie whole and give you authentic creepy moments and scares. Regardless this movie is absent of terror, short on scares, moderate on creepy and maybe has one moment, which could possibly be considered a jump scare, maybe. It is however, yet another shaky handheld video rendition of a moderately entertaining not so horrific movie with shots of deep dark holes and minor carnage plus a few things that may make you jump therefore it will definitely be worth a free viewing or minimal rental fee when that time comes.",1416268800,3,1313,4.448132780082988

They obviously go. Ignore that initial slog and you have a great fright-fest.
  So, they go on a public tour of the sewer...holding back at one point to separate. The tour guide notices, goes back for them. They ask why a large section of the sewers are blocked off, and are told of graffiti artists and vandals, as well as weak structures. Okay, fine, they'll get back to the group. Wink-wink.
  They hold back, and burrow through a wall with an air-gun. (Why's no-one hear? Easy! It's a MOVIE! Don't interrupt.) They get through the wall, where they're greeted by one cohort's old graffiti (What about the wall? What'd I say about interrupting?), and a Satanic cult praying (Wall? Interruptions?).
  As they traverse the sewer, they run into objects symbolizing sins of their pasts. Basically, coming to terms with their actions back then- if they can -determines their fate now. I was more than happy that it never got too ""preachy."" Liked it a lot.",1410825600,6,1175,4.625

This is another hand held genre. It was confusing as to who was filming as the camera is sometimes in two different rooms. In this film, the sound is bad, the lighting is low, the camera is in constant shaking mode, heads are cut off making the film nearly unwatchable.

The things that happen are completely amazing and frightening, it was without a doubt one of the most amazing fantastic movies (not just horror genre) I have ever seen.

6612573,1,B00N5AICVQ,"Warning: spoilers galore:

Scarlet Marlow is on a quest to find the Philosopher's Stone, an ancient mythological treasure that can turn base metals into gold and grant eternal life to those who find it.  How original is that?  In a harrowing and well-directed sequence that opens the film, she manages to photograph the Rose Key, which contains the secret to finding the Philosopher's Stone.  As this was her father's life's work and the cause of his madness and suicide, she is determined to find the elusive prize.  After leaving Iraq she connects with her translator George in Paris and elicits his help in translating the Rose Key.  He promises to help her translate but refuses to provide her any further help; this caused me to deduce correctly that he would soon be joining Scarlet in her search.  After visiting an ancient church, she determines that that the Stone is hidden somewhere in the ancient Paris catacombs.  Scarlet then obtains the assistance of Papillion, a self-styled expert in the Paris catacombs and apparent graffiti artist, promising him the spoils of the search.  At this point, I thought that Steve McQueen must be rolling in his grave.  Together with Papillion's ""team"" they sneak into the catacombs and begin their journey.

From here the plot goes from murky to ridiculous as the promising beginning is sacrificed to a story that degenerates into a tour through the catacombs beneath Paris in pursuit of the mythical Philosopher's Stone.  I found this part of the premise of the film to be intriguing, as publicity for the film boasted that the search was filmed in the actual Paris catacombs.  Unfortunately that promise did not come to fruition.

The balance of the film treats us to a claustrophobia-inducing, endless tour of the catacombs, many of the tunnels being barely large enough to squeeze through.  As the group progresses through the catacombs, up into tunnels, down into water and back again, I kept wondering where this was heading, and glanced at my watch a lot.  There are endless clues and some frightening moments, but much of the action is ruined by an overwhelming sense on the part of the viewer that these tunnels are leading to nowhere.  As they continue to travel, sometimes seemingly moving in a circle, the plot makes less and less sense as our intrepid explorers penetrate deeper and deeper.  Admittedly there are a few spooky moments, which would have improved the film if they made any sense.  The end of this mess was one of the most pathetic non-events I have ever encountered in a motion picture, and I scratched my head as I experienced a ""Huh?  That's it?"" moment.  As I filed out of the theater with the other half-dozen moviegoers who sat through this atrocity, I was extremely grateful that I had made use of a free movie pass that a friend had given me.  Bottom line: extremely claustrophobic tour of the Paris catacombs combined with a nonsensical plot and too few scary moments made for one of the most disappointing trips to the movies I've had this year.
