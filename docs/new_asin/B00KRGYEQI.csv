8660977,5,B00KRGYEQI,This movie is a haunting slow burn about a woman who hides away at a beach house after her husband is convicted of financial fraud. The acting is subtle and wonderful. There is an element of the supernatural that adds and eerie quality to the tone of the film. It is a introverted cathartic journey.,1415318400,,299,4.454545454545454
