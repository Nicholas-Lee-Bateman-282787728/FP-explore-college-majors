4236728,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Everyone knows that the distinction between fiction and non-fiction is a false dichotomy.  They are two sides of the same coin and much of the most interesting recent cinema has attempted to address how and where they meet and intertwine.  A camera in the room changes behavior, just what an actor ate for lunch affects their performance.  It is time to do away with the old distinctions and embrace the new order.  Though filmmakers on the margin have been doing this for sometime, Exit Through the Gift Shop has brought it right up to the fringe of the mainstream.  Fact and fiction blend in Banksy's film about the art/street art world.  The art world constructs and defines itself just as we construct and define our own realities and truths.
Down with the cinema of facts!  Onward with the cinema of truth!",1290988800,,811,4.709219858156028
4236729,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Documentaries don't often thrill me - but this movie kept me more on the edge of my seat than most standard action films.  I got to see one of Banksy's works while in Boston, and have since been very interested in the street art world.  This movie does exactly what all documentaries should do - it gives you a first person immersion into a world that exists but most people don't even know is there.  It's equal parts riveting and sad, but all together entertaining.  You won't be able to look at a wall the same way again....and I mean that as a compliment.",1289520000,8,559,4.346153846153846
4236730,4,B003ZXNCH2,"The definition of art is constantly evolving, and the exploits of street-artists and graffiti painters have certainly stretched the envelope separating art from vandalism.

4236731,5,B003ZXNCH2,"I went into this film not knowing exactly what to expect - for one thing I had very little interest in the topic of Street Art, but I'd read an article about Banksy in the WSJ a while back and the film was recommended by a couple of friends.  I'm glad I gave it a chance, as Exit Through the Gift Shop is a brilliant, hilarious, entertaining, and thought provoking documentary, or mockumentary - I'm not sure which.  The film style reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap-Blu-ray/dp/B000Y5JFN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-s-Marlowe/dp/B001MTT5BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where's Marlowe?</a>, although it's better done and funnier than both.

The characters are unforgettable - Banksy, who's face and voice are disguised, serves as a narrator of sorts and is the true mastermind behind the entire experiment.  Banksy is excellent, but the star of the show is Thierry Guetta, a Frenchman who sets out to make a documentary on Street Art.  I do not believe in narrating the story in my reviews due to spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say that Thierry has an overabundance of energy and passion for his work and the art he pursues but he lacks the organization and formal training (i.e. proper editing, narration) to produce a refined final work.  Thierry's character is a classic underdog - a clueless yet talented (in some respects) dreamer that the audience can't help but root for.  When Banksy and Thierry finally meet, Banksy turns the tables and Thierry the documenter becomes the documented, with hilarious results.

Exit Through the Gift shop is extremely funny - laugh out loud funny, from beginning to end.  But unlike most comedies, Exit Through the Gift Shop actually asks a thought provoking question - What is Art?  I'm not quite sure how to formulate my answer at this point, and the film certainly demands a second viewing, but through Thierry and the challenge he's set upon Bansky does an incredible job of framing the question.

I mentioned at the beginning of this review I didn't have much interest in the subject matter of Street Art, and moreover when I saw the film I dragged with me a friend and his wife who had even less interest than I.  They went in with sort of a ""really Adam, what are you getting us into?"" attitude (along with 4th who went much more willingly) ... at the end of the film the four of us looked at each other and simultaneously mouthed ""wow"".  I haven't done any research on the film after the fact and honestly I can't tell you how much of this ""documentary"" is staged/preplanned/hoax and how much is real (my guess is something in the middle), but either way it was well worth the price of admission.

Exit Through the Gift Shop is excellent - hilarious, thought provoking, and most importantly it includes original and genuinely likable characters.  Whether you're interested in Street Art or into the ""indie"" film scene or not, this one is worth buying, and I say that as someone who doesn't buy very many DVDs/Bluray in the age of netflix.

Five stars.",1286409600,8,3194,5.1134615384615385
4236732,4,B003ZXNCH2,"What began as an exciting and fascinating peek into Banksy's world of street artists is sadly derailed when the no-talent filmmaker is allowed to co-opt the film to drone on about himself, and his self-promotion as an ""artist"" (achieved through an army of hired help).

As the camera shows the artists and filmmakers in their beautiful rooms and gardens, surrounded by pricey electronics, framed original art, shelves and shelves of books, and in workshops filled with thousands of dollars of equipment and supplies, they seem so wealthy...with resources the kids of ""Style Wars"" could only dream of.

Banksy, in his interviews, is thoughtful, intelligent, interesting, fun, and just as charming as his artwork. Maybe someday there will be a film truly about Banksy instead of this interloper.",1285113600,2,793,5.2362204724409445
4236733,5,B003ZXNCH2,"In ""Exit through the Gift Shop,"" a documentary directed by Banksy, a man named Thierry Guetta becomes obsessed with street art so with his TV camera he takes thousands of hours of footage of the street ""artists"" putting their work everywhere they can find to plant the stuff. He starts filming in L.A. and fastens on the ""master"" Shepard Fairey, an extremely handsome young man, whose ""Obey"" and his Obama piece have become famous (there's a book of his work titled ""Obey"").
This street art is about one level up from graffiti, and, of course is done illegally, clandestinely  on public and private property. This documentary shows the leading figures of the genre in America, England, France, and other parts of the world.
Banksy, an English ""artist"" who was very elusive finally revealed himself to Thierry and allowed himself to be filmed. Banksy was one of the artists who morphed into a pop artist and had a big pop art show in L.A. called ""Barely Legal"" with a live elephant painted in vivid pink. His installation of a V shaped red English phone booth was clever and became iconic. In the film his voice is disguised, and he is shown in semi-darkness wearing a hood.
Thierry becomes a street artist himself, then morphs into a pop artist calling himself ""Mr. Brainwash."" He has a huge show called ""Life is Beautiful"" in L.A. and sells more than a million dollars worth of stuff the first day. Much of the art will remind you of Andy Warhol and is often derivative rather than highly original though some of it is clever and comic.
At the end of the film Banksy and Fairey comment on Thierry's work, and they regard his work as a rip-off. The film itself and Thierry as a pop artist may all be a Banksy hoax.
As a documentary it is cleverly done, funny at times, and a commentary on the strange world we live in where art has no intrinsic value. Some viewers of this film will be annoyed by these so-called street artists who keep depositing their ""art"" all over streets and buildings where it often constitutes litter and not the beautification of buildings but desecration. Graffiti in many major cities added to urban blight and decay.
It's a fascinating view of a world most of us know little about. The amazing thing is the way some of these artists have cashed in on their creations.",1278201600,3,2295,4.611246943765281
4236734,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Movie focuses mostly on the guy who tried to make the movie. Banksy is in the movie and a major part, but mostly it is about Terry, a guy who was in the right place at the right time and was a bit retarded.",1275696000,,206,3.7045454545454546
4236735,5,B003ZXNCH2,"""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is a documentary comedy of sorts about the unsuccessful making of a documentary about street art/graffiti. When French designer clothes shop owner, Thierry Guetta becomes obsessed with recording his everyday life on film, he finds a muse in capturing street artists at night creating their work. His passion results in tapes upon tapes upon tapes by the thousands of famous street artists like Space Invader, Shepard Fairey, and the fiercely anonymous Banksy with a global reputation for his work on the Palestinian West Bank among other projects.

What is graffiti? What is art? Does it depend solely on its location? Or just whether or not people judge it as good? I can't answer these questions alone, but personally if it were my building, I'd be pretty ticked unless it were amazing and helped attract business.

Thierry begins with his cousin who goes by the handle, Space Invader because he shapes pieces out of cubes to recreate images of characters from that video game and Pac-Man and places them everywhere. Through that relationship, Thierry comes into contact with Shepard Fairey who created the iconic image of Andre the Giant's face with the word ""OBEY"" underneath that has become recognizable in pop culture and is best known as the creator of the Barack Obama ""Hope"" poster. Street artists use a variety of techniques including props (a blow-up doll, a mutated phone booth), giant stickers, stencils to spray paint through, and of course the good ol' freestyle spray-painting method most of us are familiar with when we think of the trade. There is a spirit of creativity and passion mixed with stealth and plotting with look-outs to avoid the cops that makes the profession exciting to those involved. Repetition of similar images and signatures is what makes artists arise from utter obscurity to some sort of notoriety and sense of validity.

The film has short segments of interviews with Thierry and a mysterious hooded man in black with a voice-changer whom we eventually find out is Banksy. Banksy is Thierry's own white whale, the most difficult artist to track down that no one knows contact information for and the harder he is to find, the more he is needed for the footage collection. Banksy's spirit of doing it for the love of making a statement is preached heavily in the film despite his choice to put on an art show that attracted quite a bit of media coverage and money.

What is fascinating about this film is its surprise in direction. After all, it starts with family footage of Thierry, branches out into graffiti, and his aspirations to make a documentary about it. When the artists get to view Thierry's edited film, ""Life by Remote Control"", it looks like it could cause an epileptic seizure with all the hummingbird editing and acid color changes. Banksy who has a directing credit on this film gives Thierry some busy work so he can recover the footage and put it in a watchable format since Thierry is a lousy editor. The camera gets turned back on Thierry to watch as he pursues his own art career at the prodding of Banksy. What follows is very amusing as Thierry takes everything he learned through observing as a jumping off point to assemble his own army of artists to attempt to create something larger than any of his predecessors much to their surprise.

Thierry is a mystery. Thierry can come off as an idiot, he forms sentences in English in an awkwardly but entertaining way, and somehow manages accidentally to bring genius to his own promotions and art. He has such a scattered, disorganized personality and it makes him difficult to work with. For example, soon before the opening of his big show, some promoters show up to take care of some of the detail work to allow Thierry more time just to choose his pieces to put on the walls....which he STILL fails to start until 8 hours beforehand. This leads the promoter after interacting with him several times to conclude ""he might be a little retarded"" and just take over certain aspects and throwing things up to finish the job.

Hearing the other artists comment on Thierry's journey, they can't help but muster astonishment, jealousy, and a little bitterness at his clumsy becoming of an overnight sensation. Even though Banksy himself makes some snide remarks, he is the director of the film and benefits highly from its production. Could Thierry himself be a creation of Banksy's imagination for performance art purposes? Who knows? Whatever the case, the journey is funny, interesting, and entertaining.",1274918400,7,4546,4.882124352331606
4236736,5,B003ZXNCH2,"This isn't a traditional documentary, and I'm honestly not sure how sincere it is. One of the other reviews of this piece (an incredibly long, rambling, painful review) documents what happens in the film, and is right to question its sincerity. Although the film seems to bemoan the downfall of ""street art,"" I think instead it rightfully engages what it is and means to be an artist in a capitalist system. It's very funny, very introspective, and often very profound, and is only strengthened by the nagging suspicion that the anger at ""selling out"" isn't actually anger at all. It reminds me more of Banksy's early work, where he placed his own paintings in major galleries, than the kind of high-profile ""sincere"" work that characterizes most street artists that become well-known. And, of course, it's an effort FROM those same artists, self-referential and self-questioning, but always interesting. Well worth watching, and a great documentary for an art class on public or socially active art.",1273881600,74,1000,5.103658536585366
4236737,3,B003ZXNCH2,"Immediate reaction after just seeing it... The film critics LOVE this movie but it is not THAT great. Maybe art critics love it too? EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP is so clever and ""hysterical"", etc., and, you know, it like questions ""what is art??"" and pokes fun at/critiques the ""inanity"" of the art world, etc. It's a brilliant, satirical, """"subversive"""" send-up of fill-in-the-blank. Of the art world, YOU, me, society, art itself, so-called ""street art"". I wasn't sure, but was curious.

Just saw it and it isn't THAT entertaining or illuminating, to me anyways. Why I feel this way is I guess because I'd hoped for a doc mostly on graffiti artists and of course on U.K. based artist Banksy that also featured insightful commentary on the art world and the filthy lucre that runs the show ETC. And I don't like this guy Thierry Guetta, whoever he is. So I was wanting something a little different ok.

Guetta aka Mr. Brainwash ends up the main feature. Some people are saying this whole thing is a prank. It is a faux documentary. I'd read the film subject was Banksy who in turn became the ""director"" and turned the tables on the guy who was originally doing a film on Banksy and street art. This peculiar L.A. boutique owner Frenchman Terry Guetta was the ""filmmaker"". If he really put on an ""art"" show like presented in this movie, he is a brilliant conman (and maybe truly mentally ill -but a brilliant conman nonetheless). Anyway, the movie starts off good with some priceless footage of incredible art and artists at work and getting chased by cops. And when we meet Terry he seems cool as a fan obsessively video recording street artists while they do their thing and he becomes a trusted aid in their risky nocturnal outings to put pictures on buildings and public spaces. Terry assists Shepard Fairey of ""Obey"" and Obama Hope poster fame (you know the one. Wonder what he thinks of O'Bummer now. Artists can be pretty naive, politically.). And we meet Invader who is named after his claim to street art fame, his ""Space Invader"" pieces based on the 80s pixel video game characters. (Got to love it! I played that game when I was little. Ahhh, nostalgia for pop-culture artifacts. Darn it tho! Been seeing Space Invaders and Atari images on t-shirts at the Target. Oh well so it goes...). Terry is kinda likable at first, budding with infectious enthusiasm, and he records EVERYTHING and promises -lies- to the artists he records that he is making a documentary of their work. This appeals to them, esp. because of the temporary nature of their work. They paint on buildings and put things up on private property that are usually taken down quickly (or it was back-in-the-day and still is by poor unfortunate souls that may not know they have a real Banksy on their building! Cha-Ching!!). Anyway Terry finally meets the elusive and mysterious Banksy while the artist is on a mission in L.A. Like a true life comic book hero Banksy keeps his origins a mystery and his birth name and appearance secret from the public and has an inner core of trusted aids and confidants who help him with his ongoing mission to do what he does. Make really truly cool art, basically. --A highlight of the film are recordings of the artist painting the Wall in Israel. Brilliant.-- (Look at some compilation tribute clips on YouTube.)

To cut to the chase, turns out Terry ain't no ""film maker"" when he shows Banksy a bizarre final product that is simply a horrid, nonstop, random, back-to-back series of images that he'd recorded over the years. Banksy realizes, at least according to *this* movie you see, that Terry is a talentless nut. So he plays it cool and recommends Terry go home to L.A. and ""make his own art"". This is not a good idea... L-O-L. Or is it? Ha-ha. I think we're supposed to be laughing anyway in any case, if you're clever enough maybe. I'm not sometimes. Meanwhile Banksy decides he'll try to do something with the footage himself, realizing the importance of the precious footage and documenting his and his fellow artists' work. Anyway, Terry morphs into street artist ""Mr. Brainwash"" and somehow gets together a massive crew of people to make art for him and then puts on an absurdly massive ""art show"" in L.A. and, with the help of some blurbs by luminaries such as Banksy, the press covers the show and he makes millions. Mr. Brainwash's stuff is nothing but knockoffs of actual street artists and as somebody says he succeeds even quicker than Andy Warhol himself in making meaningless his chosen subjects. And so for example Mr. Brainwash has instead of a Campbell's Soup Can --a giant Campbell's Soup Spray Can. And a bunch of goofy portraits of celebrities and politicians inspired by Warhol's Marilyn Monroe. And a stroke of genius of Mr. Brainwash is the stack of T.V.s built into the shape of a robot. How much? I must have it! And an Elvis holding a toy gun. Sux. The footage of the crowd attending the opening is disgusting. The phonies and pretentious creeps and predictable pseudo-intellectual art gallery claptrap. I guess -no, I know- this is supposed to be funnier than what I found it, but really I just hated the people and the grand poser Mr. Brainwash with his muttonchops and dumb, banal statements and dumb name. It was amusing to hear some of his crew that helped (knowingly?) put on the hoax call him retarded on camera (But in fairness to all, like What is a hoax in this ""art world""?). Now Banksy and Shepard Fairey do express their regrets on camera over what transpired with Terry. Is the joke really on them then? Banks says he'll never help anybody again. Actually that really IS a funny moment and got some chuckles from the crowd. Is it a real sentiment? And Fairley thoughtfully remarks that artists usually take time to develop their styles (unlike Mr. Brainwash). And somebody, I forget who, wonders what this Mr. Brainwash thing all means for the meaning of art, etc. and if there's a joke here then what is the punch line... Hmmm.

...Maybe I'll find it more amusing and fascinating on dvd if a friend rents it and I'm drunk. But after seeing Exit Through the Gift Shop I have lost interest in street art and have even less faith in humanity or the possibility for meaning through art and the creative spirit of fellow human beings. Thanks. Actually if the whole thing is a joke it is funny, but damn that is really, really twisted. ""Haha you fools! You'll buy anything! Look here is a hack that we supported selling unoriginal knock-offs that invalidates(?) street art culture."" Is this what I failed to appreciate on my initial viewing? Maybe I'll laugh more latter you hipster nihilists. No THAT isn't right. It IS a send-up of crass commercialism, conspicuous consumption and all.

Actually, you know who I thought of when I saw this? A vandal known as ""The Splasher"". That'd be a great documentary to ""subvert"" $--- with. The Splasher splashes paint onto street art thereby ruining it in protest of the selling-out of the street art scene. Anyway this character Mr. Brainwash is incredibly lame but, come to think of it, he is more subversive than the Splasher. When crass figures like Terry ""Mr. Brainwash"" Guetta arrive and usurp they are a signaler of decline...  Wait honestly I just laughed out loud when I pictured him. ""Life is Beautiful"" was the name of his multi-million dollar L.A. fake-art show shebang. I 'lol-ed' Well Whatever. Con-art/Street-art. How about calling it F'art. ??????????????$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

It does a good job portraying how everybody is not cut from the same fibers concerning art, why it interests them, and why they do it. It also shows you how some artists use their art as a way to bolster or reinforce their ego, while to others it is a from of expression that they don't necessarily do for other people, even if it is in public.

4236825,3,B003ZXNCH2,"Exit Through the Gift Shop was a documentary which delved into the underworld of street artists.  Of the artists in the film, I had only ever heard of Banksy, though I didn't know anything about him or his art.  The film is actually about the guy who filmed the documentary, which is a strange juxtaposition of roles, but it surprisingly works out.

The film seemed a bit incongruous, speaking of things that had happened before the camera man had met an artist, but there was footage of the event spoken about - how did he film an event which happened before he knew about it?  I was not impressed with the art of any of the artists (especially the 'artist' who the film was actually about) aside from Banksy, who actually does have talent, I found out through this film.  The primary artist of the film, who decided to do art sorta on a whim, feels like a hack.  I got the impression that he only thought what he was doing looked cool cause it resembled the art others were doing, but it's just all in his mind, a delusional pretentious artist.  By using his connections in the industry, and perhaps a little grey-area use of his artist friends, he was able to promote his art enough that people felt it was worth something.

Being able to see the work and methods involved in creating street art was very interesting, and I liked being able to see into this (often illegal) realm.  There were lots of interesting people and artists along the way, and even some thrilling scenes.  Again, seeing some of the art (Banksy's stuff in my opinion) was a real treat!

Overall, I wasn't that impressed with this documentary.  It was a huge improvement over the film that the camera man had assembled, but turning the focus onto him, rather than the artists he was filming, was a mistake, in my opinion.  He just wasn't that interesting or talented.  If you're curious about Banksy or the world of street art, I'd give this a watch, but I wouldn't set my hopes high or recommend it for anything other than a passing glance.",1431907200,,2016,4.502747252747253

4236866,3,B003ZXNCH2,"It is self-dubbed The Worlds First Street Art Disaster Movie. And when the film first started, I
watched the images of two-bit graffiti bombers and rolled my eyes expecting that this
destructive, ugly lot of sorely misdirected painters would be glorified. But the director quickly
focuses on the crme de la crme of street artistry in a quirky, engaging, and funny look at this
underground world. How underground, you ask? The directors street name is Banksy, and his
appearance throughout the film is in shadows with disguised voice.
Exit through the Gift Shop starts with an oddball filmmaker named Thierry Guetta, who started
as a filming enthusiast then turned his obsession toward filming street artists, eventually to
documenting the work of elite street artists. He had reached new heights by filming the work of
Shepard Fairey, the man responsible for the Obama image of Hope that permeated the last
presidential election. During the filming of footage a number of years back, Fairey was in the
midst of branding his face based on an illustration of wrestling celebrity Andre the Giant with the
one-word tagline Obey. Youve seen the artwork, youll recognize it during that part of the film.
But it wasn't until Guetta was contacted by mega-celebrity street artist Banksy that he felt he
had reached the pinnacle of his filmmaking endeavors. Banksy did something he had never
beforeallowed Guetta to follow him into his underground world of pop street art. What Banksy
didnt know is how terrible a film editor Guetta was. The result: Banksy took the footage
captured by Guetta and turned it into Exit through the Gift Shop.
Rhys Ifans a British actor who appeared with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts in Notting Hill and
in an offbeat film entitled Danny Deckchair narrates the film. Sundance was first to host Exit
through the Gift Shop to a standing room only crowd at Sundance this year. There is some
speculation that parts of the film are more mockumentary than documentary (that is, put on),
but this does little to detract from the film.",1408406400,,2047,4.936231884057971

4236868,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Just as fight club screws w/ your mind, this dvd will make fun of art & art world in general. Like maurizio cattalan, banksy raises questions about art & people trying to look like they appreciate art. What banksy is trying to do is show that one should be suspicious of dealers & curators who justify something is worth x amount of $[preferable above $50,000minimum or dealers cant drive in fancy cars] may be a joke on you as the buyer.

all the top rated reviewers have done great jobs explaining why this was a great movie & i won't bother. But i have to commend banksy for being a good editor or hiring a very good editor to present multiple stories using guetta & his material ie 1) record of street art from the 90s 2) banksy's work during that era 3) presenting the irony of guetta as an artist & 4) illusion of art & art world as a cash grab in general

lastly,banksy is making fun of us for respecting $1m+ art pieces in museums ie bec it didn't start off at $1m. it was worth a lot less until some one paid a $1m or more due to scarcity value  etc. So if you see some flogging art for $1, who knows..it may be worth millions 50-100 yrs from now..

so start hunting..

4236876,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Just about anything worth documenting is documented by someone other than the star of the show. The people who are hungry, unemployed, suffering at the hands of a for-profit healthcare industry, died for a cause, reign in Dog Town or are Sugar Man himself seldom have the time, energy, money or knowhow to script and film their stories. Documentary stars--most of them--probably never even considered documenting their stories. The same was true for street artists, but they are a horse of a different color. The fact that they, vandals at their best, would let an outsider in to film them was unusual. That the man behind the camera turned out to be a guy who just liked to film things (including thousands of hours of unedited street art film footage), and had no talent for documentary-making, had to be both disappointment and aggravation to the artists who had come to appreciate the idea of chronicling the expression designed to raise awareness of society's malfunction, but--because their messages were posted on other people's walls--seldom had the chance to survive more than a few days. Ultimately, Banksy, the elusive king of the street art counterculture, takes charge and creates a documentary that stars the man who shot the film, but only features the pioneer artists and their work. The real talent takes a backseat to the antithesis of the movement in this film, but it turns out to be a great way to reveal the heart of the street art counterculture.",1402444800,,1469,4.903614457831325

Everything. ""I'm your daddy momma. Even if I never hold your hand""-
""Strange things going on with the zombies in S. Fl. ""
""Nah, B**ch, you gotta be ready to fight if you gonna cross some ni**a out"" , - banksy we know is info . N. ve-sira.
He talks big game but he ain't no big deal, when it's happen to him.

He hijacks popular ""Americana"" symbolism- Ford, Disney, McDonalds, Apple imagery.

""Me, I just like her hips and bad attitude show. She's sweetcakes, cream-soft on the inside in my arms. Look at that baby bottom soft giggle"" Pow! Right in the kisser!

 Consulting art critic says- "" These floosin' idiots all forgot that verifying identity is tough as nails ! But more if all you looking at is tags on the walls !!! "" Oh it must have been him, look at the ""motion, the anger, the size"" baksy's graffiti urban graffiti-theorist's chat over ""high end""coffee in low brow looking environments. That's expensive..

A swindler, humbugbler, crook, with royalties and millionaire legal income, to supplement his illegeal criminal enterprising income in order to fund more ""ransom-inheretance"" threats.
banksy-goal- find my real self i lost with the stolen bicycle-poppa look! - not important. Turn as many humans as possible into criminals with at least graffiti. Turn as many women as possible into "" s**ts"" porn via stardom. banksy the biggest wh**e of anyone.

Men-Don't be better than him at graffiti or non-criminal skills. He is a emotional little baby who doesn't mind murder. He also likes to get pegged in the rear. Be a pug. and you'll be fine.

Women- You will always be ok in ""banksy's pirate revolution. As long as you have sex with him and anyone else he tells you to when he does, not anyone else. More to, don't talk to those whom make him feel, and look less than what he views himself as.

So banksy got into turning college kids into criminals begin at graffiti, and young women with children into threat criminals and thieves. Just cuz he like to see graffiti on the walls ! The horror, the Suffering ! ! Assigned marriages?

info- banksy? Lakes of Meadows cupcakes-
""N. aves-ira calls the same person a cra**a and a ni**a in the same sentence"", then sells books to hippie chicks and hipster it-ellectuals, and upset midlife moms with a streak.

He recruits the kids, then recruits the kid's family so the kid's are alright. NO it's not !
They are getting done on both ends! So then we get what we see on the news, all in the past 12 years whatnut.

- It's random - It's lucas, and his admirers lost in the brainwash, and in his own words- ""God, do not forgive them, they know what they do"" he's also screwing the admirers. Eventually, if not also THEIR kids-
Will they also join the cult, hippie murder, steal, become criminals?

Damn, at least we were born in interesting times-prequel. Give a piece of s*it like n. aves-ira endless money and the world goes to babylon, because-

4236894,4,B003ZXNCH2,Definitely interesting. Opens you up to art and segment of society that I knew little about.  It drags a bit but the las 30 minutes are really interesting.,1397779200,,155,4.535714285714286
4236895,4,B003ZXNCH2,"The chutzpah, the audacity, the humor of it all. But also the insolence and the absurdity of it, especially how we, the masses, react to this so-called ""street art"", and how some are willing to pay dearly for it.

This is the story about a contradictory form of art, one that is both an affront yet still worthy of praise, one that mocks merit, yet retains its own merit.  Beyond the familiar, ugly graffiti and its contempt for private ownership this film shows another side of an art form that brings its own undeniable creativity, originality and visual appeal.

But more it it is also the story of some of its top practitioners, their obsessiveness, and their willingness to take risks, to live unconventional lives,  devoted to their art.  Not as a means to an end, but for its own sake, and perhaps also because....they just can't help themselves.",1397779200,,853,4.697986577181208

4236898,5,B003ZXNCH2,"This movie gives you a good view into the world of true graffiti artists...at least as far as I can tell, not being one, myself. It also has more to say in the way of social commentary. I will leave that to the viewer to see and judge.

Basically, it's a documentary, about a person who wanted to make a documentary on street art. Strange, yes, but it works and is all explained early in the film.

It can get a little slow at parts, but, overall, very much worth your time.",1397260800,,474,4.141304347826087
4236899,5,B003ZXNCH2,This movie is amazing whether you think it is real or a hoax.  The shots of these amazing street artists in action make it worth watching alone.  The bizarre side story is entertaining and endearing.,1397088000,,199,4.6571428571428575

4236902,5,B003ZXNCH2,"A must see for Banksy (and street art) fans. It is a well shot documentary style film that left me wondering if I was put on and just led to believe that it was a documentary. The ""plot"" is Mr. Brainwash's (a frenchman and cousin of ""Invader"") who can't stop shooting footage of anything that moves. He films Invader making a few of his street mosaics and the rest chaotically falls into place. I found it inspiring, uplifting and above all a heart-felt, well shot, well directed (well acted?) film that anyone looking for something different could watch and be entertained. Great interviews with Shepard Fairey, Invader and Banksy himself.",1396828800,,640,4.827272727272727
4236903,4,B003ZXNCH2,"I thought this moc/doc was great. The way the film portrayed the French guy, the way he hyped his show and art, his use of iconic cliched imagery, his use of the system learned from following the other artists. Banksky's use of the film within a film, self promotion and questionable talent. With useless MFA's invading Brooklyn, putting plexiglass over fake Banksky's, I am living in this nonsense.

4236907,5,B003ZXNCH2,"From the selection of music to the editing to the honest documentary storyline, this was an outstanding art-related documentary.  The subject is street art, the big names like Banksy and Fairey etc, and the aspiring hanger-on who, as Banksy says in the opening, turns out to be ""more interesting than I am"", how it's made, and how it transitioned from graffiti to fine art.",1395360000,,373,4.828125

4236911,2,B003ZXNCH2,I heard a lot about this movie and Banksy so I was interested in seeing it and anticipating a good movie.  But I found it to be really boring and had to force myself to sit through the entire movie.  Maybe it's just not my kind of flick.,1394668800,,237,3.9166666666666665
4236912,4,B003ZXNCH2,"At first I hated that this veered off to focus on someone other than Banksy. But watching a talentless schlub working so hard for money and fame, and actually succeeding, felt like a perfect counterpart to some of the things I've come to feel are synonymous with Banksy's mystique: anonymity, and thought provoking political statements, and I guess artistic talent! :)",1394668800,,368,5.049180327868853

4236915,3,B003ZXNCH2,The movie was mostly interesting but got very tiring and I nearly stopped watching it as it got closer to the end. I did like the concept that people can succeed with enthusiasm and frenetic activity even though that person my not have any real talent.,1394323200,,252,4.5

4236920,5,B003ZXNCH2,A hilarious film. Almost Spinal Tap-esques in it's depiction of the evolution of Thierry's rise to fame. Plus offers a great insight into Banksy and his artistic process. Must see for any fan of Street Art.,1392854400,,206,4.75

4236922,3,B003ZXNCH2,"Certainly this was rated very highly but perhaps because it documents a few street artist and their driven behavior.  There is no real growth in the characters filmed.  Much of what they do has very little meaning.  If it were aesthetic or really artistic then it would be of more interest.  This condones a prevalent theme in our culture, I will do what I think is good or fun and creative and other people's property is not considered.

4236927,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Using classic story-telling devices, Banksy, et al, lay out the tale of Thierry, who was/is an artist of the ether.  Without rancor or judgment, the movie describes the transformation of a sort-of idea of a maybe-project, born of boredom during a family visit, into a brilliant notion of what could have been a wonderful project that instead mutates into a parasitic,opportunistic Grand Guignol of self-indulgent manic quasi-creativity.  Throughout the film, Banksy's wry comments and observations add to our understanding of the major question, ""What is Art""?",1392336000,,560,5.5

4236929,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Superb story. Instructional by 10s'. Which came first, the art or the story. Is fine art in many instances as much a tale of fine promotion as it is of applying paint to canvas? Enlightening and enriching. Well crafted story and superbly crafting marketing program for the final show. Tantamount to the, ""The Rise (And Fall) Of The Beanie Babies"". I'm better for having watched it.",1391904000,,381,4.787878787878788
4236930,4,B003ZXNCH2,"But I'm convinced that Thierry Guetta was a willing participant in what was really a ""documentary"" spoof by Banksy.  Too many clues point to this conclusion.  You never see Guetta actually produce any art.  There are only a few clips of him doing some minor spray painting or dribbling paint across some canvases.  Then there is the whole question of how a hapless videographer comes up with the money to hire a small army of people to help set up his L.A. show.  IMO, this is Banksy poking fun at the commercialization of street art, and at the gullibility and pretentiousness of those who buy it for private collections.",1391644800,,622,4.669724770642202
4236931,4,B003ZXNCH2,"I'll keep it short and sweet. I wasn't sure if this movie was pure fiction or some kind of documentary. It seemed to turn out more like a reality TV show about a guy that loves to video street artists at work. then he becomes one himself. It was all very interesting, funny, and different. Google the lead characters at the end to learn more. Worth watching for sure.",1391472000,,367,4.333333333333333

4236933,2,B003ZXNCH2,"I am a fan of the submersiveness of street art; this film took that and followed the direction of the evolution of modern street art, from becoming a slippery mythical entity, into a cultural phenomenon, and then to a commercial and profitable form of work; perhaps soulless. Here I see how the title ties the film together. But the editing drags out the story unnecessarily, often with bumbling narration. In the end it achieves this disturbed, unbalanced feeling, that the art world is contradictory and precarious; that there's so much enjoyable irony in street art entering into the elitist art space.. I get it. It is a well crafted film, yet I just did not enjoy it. Frankly I'd rather watch Jackass and view their dangerous and potentially illegal acts as performance art which have even more shock and entertainment value..",1391385600,,831,4.900709219858156
4236934,5,B003ZXNCH2,"In the seemingly arbitrary niche of contemporary art, Guetta splashes paint onto the viewer's eye. With Banksy as n. 1 accomplice.

4236935,3,B003ZXNCH2,"I stayed with this longer than I thought and ended up enjoying it very much.  Quite a lesson in it really.  Here is this fellow that just wanted to take pictures and is now one of the most endeared ""street artist"" of our time.  One has to laugh and shake your head over the path that he choose and with a wife and family to provide for.  He took a huge risk and it paid off.  Amazing story really.",1391385600,,397,3.9746835443037973

His interest in graffiti leads him to want to film Banksy and then other street artists.  He claims he is filming in order to make a movie about street art, but he has no idea how to do that and really never starts down that road until forced to.  After witnessing the marketing of street art to wealthy west cost art fanciers, he decides to put on a huge show of his own work.  He names himself Mr. Brainwash, hires 200 underlings who actually produce the art, and miraculously pulls it off.  The endorsement of Banksy is critical to his success, I would say.  When this show is hugely successful, we are left to ponder what is art?  how derivative can it be and still be art?  Is it really this easy to produce art--doesn't the artist have to suffer?

4236964,4,B003ZXNCH2,"This movie asks the age old question ""What is art?"" --the way only Banksy would ask it.  It's both a satire disguised as a documentary and vice versa, which both celebrates street art and makes fun of it at the same time.  Even now as media outlets post Banksy artwork sightings and Sothby's sell Banksy artworks for north of million Euros, the hype is profound and profitable.  Just look at the Amazon rating and the selling price of this DVD/HD Blue-Ray. (You can watch this for free with Amazon Prime).

I like Bansky's artwork because it makes me stop and think.  He alters paintings like turns a scenic depiction of a country side by adding a park bench and Nazi or paints a idyllic view of paradise through the side of the West Bank wall.  Banksy loves making subversive statements.  As you watch this, you may slowly realize you are not watching a documentary but a mockumentary.

4236969,5,B003ZXNCH2,"This movie is not as much about underground art, as it is about the consumer culture in America.  If you take out the protagonist in this story and insert Steve Jobs, or any CEO of a very ""profitable"" company. You would uncover a uncomfortable story about ethics that appears funny in hindsight, but when you think about the utility of some of the items ""we"" purchase, it not as funny. We are laughing at ourselves (if you are American). Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that this can't happen anywhere else!

Many documentaries about this subject exist, but we are not laughing at the French guy, we are laughing at the [American] consumer. For instance, I started thinking about the point of my iPhone for $700.00 when I could have just purchased a computer for that price. Furthermore, while I pay a ridiculous amount for a ""smarter"" phone, I am locked into a ""dumb/expensive"" monthly contract for the service. We our being played is what the story is really saying. We are all pawns in the game of capitalism, and our government does not do a good job of protecting us from fraud, or malicious marketing.

I guess, It is our own responsibility really! Howard Zinn said, ""we can not be neutral on a moving train."", and I think this is really what the film is hinting to. There is no way this documentary is real, but I guess that is not the point! Although it could have hit a home run out the stadium, it fell short just to make us laugh; what a shame! Still funny though; I gave it five stars. I can laugh at myself. If you like this I would check out, Chompsky's Manufacturing Consent, or Media and Mind Control.",1386460800,,1622,4.436241610738255

It's a mockery, a sham, and simultaneously the truth in how the art world largely functions.  Banksy is no longer an individual but a pseudo-advertising company posing as a single artist.

I can't explain what it's ""like"" or even care to.  I just liked it!  I heard about it when it came out but since I have no interest in graffiti art I didn't bother to see it.  I found it on Netflix recently and thought I had nothing to lose to try it.  I was immediately drawn in to the film, first by the mysterious Banksy, shaded in a hoodie with a distorted voice and then by the garrulous Thierry who becomes the central character in this film.

I found the film interesting in a number of ways.  It does show some of the development of street art in London, Paris and Los Angeles and we meet some of the stars of the genre.  Then...in a very funny way we see how Thierry, who up to that point was just a compulsive photographer who never even watched the many, many films he made, morphs into a famous and successful street artist himself.  It's a real trip.  If it weren't true we wouldn't believe it.

I loved the ending, the shots of Sheppard Fairey and Banksy, trying to reconcile their parts in the ""creation"" of Mister Brain Wash with their own sense of what makes good art.  Their comments are great; I liked their art and I like them.

Don't expect a serious, linear documentary of the evolution of street art.  Banksy isn't like that.  He gave us a wonderful, smart, crazy, mind-bending, very funny film about.....who knows?  Who cares?  I found it a lot of fun and actually very inspiring.",1380153600,,1553,4.4661921708185055

The best answer I ever heard is the dumbest: art is what artists make. Therefore an artist whose qualified in the eyes of others as an artist, is an an artist, and makes art. But what about Theiry? Banksy said it best when he listed 3 options to explain the phenomenon of Mr. Brainwash when he said a) Perhaps he was a genius all along b) He got incredibly lucky or c) Art is a big joke.

Crimes including but not limited to:
Malicious guerrilla marketing , bribery, burglary, drug trafficking, narcotics, murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, coercion to murder, terrorism, cult activities, suicide..

Banksy does not reveal his real name and identity, does not exist.
He is not british, he is a American citizen, with a social security number. A number.

Symbols, like ----- Because few people like us would go to his house and institute our own version of his ""art"" garbage, nonsense politics that he does not even believe himself, if not seek justice for crimes against one.

Banksy has young, impressionable kids, and old impressionable children convinced that they have to steal everything. If not, they aren't ""real"". He has brainwashed these kids, and old people who naively have a genuine interest in art, or being ""down"". The kids think they have to steal their paint to be real mural artists. Somewhere in his deluded mind, he equates stealing something with ""earning it"". Lucas Naveira is a thief, a crook. crook crome msg 28 kidult. That's all he is good at. Crime. Not art. People are dead because of this.
He steals space, including the space between your ears.
At university he is recruiting your children with the ""12oz. prophet International Graffiti Scholarship"".

In 2013-2014 select citizens have been given complimentary spray cans, and paint supplies, implementing active community service. When this fool, wrote and ""writes"" his ""skills"", what did they do? They took him out. Put a child in his place. Small children 4 years, better artists than he.

Nope.

NO SHOW.
Like Mad Drama.

Everyone fights banksy's fights except him, DME, Don'tMakeExcuses is blaming everyone around him except himself for helping him realize what he really is. A maladjusted victim who thinks he deserves respect for having the artistic skill set of a 5th grader combined with criminal tendencies, and a delusional ego reminiscent of Jim Jones and Charles Manson.

Not a man. A tourist, who travels not to learn about human culture, but to vandalize other cultures. Plastering his name on walls and leave, so he is not touched by the culture, the people.

4237025,4,B003ZXNCH2,"I thought this was a documentary about Banksy, the world-renowned street artist (read: graffiti vandal), and it is to some extent.  But to a greater extent, Exit Through the Gift Shop : A Banksy Film (2011) is about how anything that is cool and underground necessarily becomes overexposed and mainstream.  This movie was so-so as entertainment but pretty good as a parable of how the cutting edge loses its edge.  Semi-spoiler: this might be a mockumentary.

Thierry (pronounced ""Terry""; he's French) Guetta is a film nut.  He also owns a successful vintage clothing shop near Hollywood.  He loves to film everything.  The camera is an omnipresent extension of his hand.  He films and films and films, but he never watches the tapes.  He stores them away in a big closet.  That is, he stored them away until he decided to put his obsession to use and film street artists as they risked life and limb for thrills and recognition.

Thierry got into filming street artists late at night as they climbed buildings and billboards to ply their craft.  We learn that these particular graffitos don't only use spray paint.  Oh no.  They head to Kinko's and order up 30 x 40 foot blowups of sketches and paintings, which are applied to walls and signs using industrial-strength glue and paint rollers.  How the cops haven't busted these artists by doing the super sleuthing of calling up the local Kinko's to find out who is spending hundreds of dollars on mega-prints is beyond me.  Although, it is not against the law to blow money on oversized copies, and I presume that these artists are well-known to the fuzz already.

In any event, Thierry latches onto Banksy after a successful stint filming another now-famous street artist, Shepard Fairey.  Banksy is a hot commodity at this point, and his work is recognizable around the globe.  Although Banksy hails from London, apparently, he flies around the world to far-flung locales like Los Angeles to paste and scrawl his creative, funny, and political works all over the place.  As his art goes vogue, he starts making bank, which allows him to pursue even more aggressive and ambitious projects and installments.  Banksy's art even graces the West Bank wall.

Thierry follows Banksy around.  Thierry is a reliable sidekick, even surviving a run-in with Disney rent-a-cops after a stunt criticizing Gitmo.  But then Theirry gets an idea:  Hey, I can do this.  So, he goes whole hog.  He mortgages all of his property.  He dumps all of the cash into popular street art of his own design and hires a team of crack artists and promoters to manufacture his Banksy-knockoff line of work by ""Mr Brainwash.""

This is where I question the reality of this documentary.  Mr Brainwash is too successful too quickly, and Thierry's work is much too similar to Banksy's style.  The implication from the documentary is that Banksy has disavowed Theirry.  Ask yourself whether it is a hoax and whether Banksy is Mr Brainwash.

Thierry sells a boatload of art.  He appears to break even and perhaps even turn a handsome profit from his first (humongous, mega) Los Angeles art show.  Street art is selling, which in turn kills it as a cool, rebellious, anti-establishment art form.  When a Banksy piece is selling for tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction, how cool can it be?

If you've never heard of Banksy and want to tune in for a phenomenon that was catching steam in the mid-2000s, this is a good bet as a primer.  But don't expect a thrilling story with a ""Wow!"" ending.  The film seems to drift away more than tie itself into a nice bow.",1361491200,,3587,4.761363636363637

Enjoy this well told, well edited ride around the world following the art scene. Thierry is a smart, albeit, unconventional business man that knows how to commercialize the emotion of the masses. He knows the emotional power and connection to the dollar. It seems to be his passion.  He makes his money, loves life and family and then takes time off between his projects. You get a taste of this in the beginning. he knows his audience loves the nostalgia of hard to find vintage clothes. He makes  killing in this business.  You then see that by following the leaders and legends of the art world, he strips it down to the bare basics and provides an overnight brand, but by giving the fans something the other street artists can't his success is catipulted.  He provides a sense of connection.  Whether his art is athentic or not, from a commercial standpoint it is brilliant.

You have a dude with some camera fetish stumble upon the world of illicit street artists ( and artist is being used very loosely here in my opinion).  You really are talking about graffiti, and not very inventive graffiti at that.  The main camera fetish guy seems hooked on the underground quality to it.  So he relentlessly and pointlessly films a 'famous' street artist.  His big idea is a picture of Andre the Giant done in repetition and equally pointless in my opinion.

Tracing the roots of street art through the constant eye of amateur filmographer Thierry Guetta, it's a legit, vivid encapsulation of the thoughts that formed a global movement's shared ideals. Guetta, whose branching connections to the scene are nothing short of amazing, captured years' worth of footage, then filed it away with no sense of categorization or even basic labeling. The resultant greatest hits reel makes for some rich viewing material, but I certainly don't envy the amount of whittling it took to get there. At some point those tapes must have run dry, though, because the focus suddenly shifts from the notorious exploits of Space Invader, Shepard Fairey and Banksy to Guetta's own farcical artistic aspirations. Whether intentional or not, (and I'm fairly certain it was) that jolting misdirection changes the tone from a fresh, adventurous documentary to a thick, bitter dissertation on art-for-profit and the redundant question of what defines the terms 'artist' and 'artwork'.

4237054,3,B003ZXNCH2,"Before I say what bothers me, know that I do like this film, as a film. But, for what was depicted, less so. I really wanted to like this film for being about Banksy. Unfortunately, I can't because it's less about him and more about the protagonist - Thierry, AKA ""Mr. Brainwash"" (MBW). I've been following Banksy for some time now and his work has inspired me and my craft. I'm not a ""street artists"", but I am a designer where the craft of making and the process of creation are much the same. So, looking at this movie from that standpoint upset me a little with the conclusion of the film. Infused with hype and a poor sense of direction, Thierry gets a push to hold an art exhibit of his work. Using connections through his friends (Banksy & Sheppard Fairey), they provided enough hype for MBW to get a lot of local media attention that made Thierry an overnight celebrity.

I didn't have an issue with the hype that was gained, however, I did have an issue with how it was gained and the art that was produced. As an artist, MBW lacked knowledge, understanding, meaning, and integrity. He made pieces just for the sake of making pieces to fill his show. He simply copied ideas he liked from other artists and put minor tweaks to them and called them his own without understanding why the work he copied was made, or what it represented to begin with. Banksy even makes mention of Thierry's lack of craft and expresses disdain for making his images ""even more meaningless"" than Andy Warhol's, but validates Warhol's work by explaining how he did it in an iconic way, whereas Thierry, he explains, simply made them meaningless.

Once MBW's show got bigger than even Banksy and Sheppard Fairey anticipated, they were less enthusiastic about what was put out and further expressed how prematurely his work had been released for a scale of its size. Before moving into the final act, MBW goes on to explain why he calls himself ""Mr Brainwash"". I felt bad, but I couldn't help but laugh when I heard just how little he truly knew about concepts and the creative process. It's challenging, in the beginning, as a creator, learning who you are and what your style is, but MBW, with a show of that scale, was consciously or unconsciously making a claim as a full fledged ""artist"", so hearing his lack of understanding simply unveiled more flaws in his body of work. Maybe, to many, it won't be so evident, but any artist or enthusiast would be able to see through his facade with this documentary. What saddens me more is that had I been at the show, I too would have loved the work - at face value. But, after watching this film, his work comes across trite knowing his foundation was unsettled.

It's true that anything can be art and anyone can create it, but when you use the iconography of others for buzz to boost your overnight claim to fame, you end up falling short to those that do it for the enjoyment of expression and for helping others (non artists especially) understand why there's a passion to create it.",1324598400,7,3018,4.53394495412844

4237071,5,B003ZXNCH2,"What starts as a possible peek into the mystery of Banksy, the world-renowned street artist, turns into an artistic peepshow into the brainwashing of a French filmmaker who in turn brainwashes his fans.

""Exit through the Gift Shop"" is a fascinating look into the world of street art and those who pursue this new form, eschewing money and personal fame for the chance to make their mark and give the finger to the establishment at the same time. Many of these artists are truly amazing, and the efforts they go to in pursuit of venues and canvases are equally amazing. In the process, though, the public interest has turned those such as the enigmatic Banksy into sellable properties. Banksy, while making political statements on the West Bank wall and other places, decides to cash in on the growing fame and does a huge show in L.A. that drew Hollywood's brightest stars. In so doing, he makes street art into something marketable on a grand scale. Was this his intention? We don't know. Conveniently, he never lets us know how much he made.

He does, however, use this film to set up the French filmmaker Thierry as
an artist to be mocked. Thierry, good at documenting but not good at putting together a cohesive film, decides to put on a show of his in L.A. By some miracle, he pulls it off, flirting with financial ruin to make it happen, and ends up making a lot of money and a new name for himself as Mr. Brainwash. Yes, his art is derivative, and no, he did not pay his dues. He becomes a slightly pathetic, slightly comedic figure in all of this. But Banksy also cashes in, while not playing as honestly by letting us in on the details of his prestige and income in the art world. He also, glaringly, fails to explain how some of these artists travel the world. Perhaps it's all part of protecting identity, but it is a question that begs to be answered throughout the film.

All of it, nonetheless, makes for some highly entertaining documentary work, and calls into question the ideas of marketing, art, and whether art can be objectively judged for its own merits or merely subjectively judged by those who buy into the hype, as in the case of Mr. Brainwash. In the end, maybe Mr. Brainwash is right. Maybe life is beautiful in the midst of all the brainwashing. Or maybe he's simply the product of ego, envy, and the desire to carve out his own niche in a world of increasing self-promotion.",1307059200,23,2405,4.549653579676674

After he shoots hundreds of videotapes of the artists, he has no idea what to do with them.

In a second twist, the videographer himself becomes a pop star, creating ""street art"" for sale and making lots of money at it.

4237080,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Before I saw ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"", it struck me as something that I wouldn't really enjoy. While I had heard of Banksy, the British street artist, before, and had enjoyed the few paintings of his that I had seen, I pegged this movie as a self-glorifying ode to street art. From the opening of the film, however, it's clear that this documentary is not going to go down that route.

The star of this film is not Banksy, it's actually the cameraman who films him, a French man by the name of Thierry Guetta. Thierry is an odd man who obsessively films everything in his life, and he stumbles upon the world of street art almost coincidentally. The film follows his exploits filming famed street artists (including Banksy) and his unlikely path into street art himself. The direction of the film changes significantly a few times, and it does take some getting used to, but in the end, it makes perfect sense, or no sense at all.

Speculations have arisen that the whole film is in fact a hoax, created by Banksy, with many questioning the authenticity of Thierry's portrayal. Whether or not it's a ""hoax"", this film is definitely the best documentary I've seen this year (not that I've seen many).

4237086,4,B003ZXNCH2,"Exit Through the Gift Shop: A Banksy Film is a film directed by Banksy that tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and his obsession with street art. The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself.

Much has been hinted at that the film is actually a hoax but it was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Feature. Banksy, the pseudonymous British street artist, has built his reputation on stunts -- like inserting his own work among the masters' in museums -- that taunted the market in which his pieces sold for millions. But with his latest project, the documentary ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" he is laboring to convince audiences that he's playing it straight. The blogs buzzed with rumours: that Mr Brainwash is nothing but a front for Banksy; even that he is Bansky. As the film picked up acclaim at Sundance and then Berlin, Mr Brainwash's career has taken off. If the film was intended as a satire on the superficiality of the contemporary art scene, the satire was going over the heads of the buyers forking out $50,000 to $200,000 a canvas. ""It doesn't matter if he is good or bad,"" one said. ""He has the right connections, and that's why I am buying. Plus, I like him.""

Ultimately, wondering whether ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is real or not may be moot. It certainly asks real questions: about the value of authenticity, financially and aesthetically; about what it means to be a superstar in a subculture built on shunning the mainstream; about how sensibly that culture judges, and monetizes, talent.

No matter whether it is real or not it is well worth seeing. The BluRay edition that I screened featured some deleted scenes, Mr. Brainwash at the Cans Festival, a fourteen minute edit of Guetta's Life Remote Control  and B Movie a film about Banksy.

4237091,4,B003ZXNCH2,"What starts off as a documentary about notorious London street artist/prankster Banksy doubles back on itself and becomes a documentary about the documentarion, one Thierry (Terry) Guetta. Thierry is a Frenchman who emigrated to Los Angeles and started a used clothing shop. He also has some sort of weird Obsessive/Compulsive disorder with video-recording every waking moment he possibly can. Somewhere in the camera era of Thierry's life, he becomes obsessed by street/graffiti artists and begins to tape them and their nocturnal activities. As he climbs the strata of artists, he eventually encounters Banksy. Voila! A film is born.

Only one problem. Turns out Thierry is a complete dud as a filmmaker and Banksy takes over the tapes and editing. This is where the film gets interesting. After watching Banksy throw a huge and profitable opening in Los Angeles, Thierry takes Banksy's offhand comment about creativity (Thierry has developed some street art and a personna of his own) to mean that Banksy is approving of Thierry's work and should become the next big name in the artist community. Before you can say 'spray paint,' Thierry is overhauling an old network studio and planning his own, major coming out exhibit.

The question is, can art be made just by sheer force of will? Thierry seems like such a savant that his ascension into a world-class artist seems hard to swallow. Even the artists he was filming on his camera seem dumbstruck that this ""character from the 1860's"" could launch himself without much experience; there are some who believe the whole ""Mister Brain Wash"" (as Thierry has now dubbed himself) is one of Banksy's elaborate pranks on the creative universe. That's not to say the film is without entertainment value. Thierry is, despite his loopiness, a charming eccentric; his own determination to hype himself into a success supplies ""Exit Through The Gift Shop"" with humor and interest. The gray area the film treads between creativity, hype and scam is so blurry that the DVD becomes its own circular argument, and a heck of a lot of fun.",1299542400,5,2076,5.031976744186046

****1/2

""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is a documentary about a documentarian, a film about filming.  At times, it's hard even to tell who's the subject of the film and who's the creator.  At some point in the movie, the street artist and the filmmaker switch roles, with the street artist becoming the filmmaker and the filmmaker becoming the street artist.  It's all very mind-blowing and Pirandellian, to say the least, but it sure makes for one hell of a clever and fascinating film.  A bit too clever, perhaps, for there are those who've accused the film of being a hoax, of being just an elaborate work of ""street art"" in its own right.

Thierry Guetta is a French migr living in Los Angeles who has apparently recorded virtually every single moment of his adult life on videotape and film.  A few years into this obsession, Thierry began filming a number of underground ""street artists"" from various cities, as, under the cloak of darkness, they secretly created their works.  These included such well-known figures as Shepherd Fairey (he of the ubiquitous Obama poster) and Bansky, a British artist who had already established quite a reputation for himself in London.  But not only did Thierry film them doing their art, he frequently joined them in the process, often at great risk to his own freedom and safety.

It is with Bansky that the movie begins to get truly mind-bending and complicated, for it is he who directed ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" not Thierry, yet he uses Thierry's footage.  So who is the actual maker of the film?  Who can say?  And what does that say about the fluidity of the creative process?  About blurring the line between art and its subject?  (To hide his identity, Bansky appears only in silhouette as he films himself giving interviews for the audience).  Then about halfway through the movie, we discover that Thierry has become a street artist (going by the appellation Mr. Brainwash) himself, sponsoring elaborate gallery shows displaying his own work.

And as Thierry begins to achieve fame, fortune and international acclaim as the ""new Wharhol,"" we can't help noting the irony that an art form that originally sprang up as a subversive reaction against the Establishment has now gone full-board mainstream itself, earning millions for its pieces and high-profile celebrity for its artists.  No more furtive forays into the dead-of-night for this dude at least.

If you're confused by all this, don't worry.  Even after seeing the film, I still cannot say I understand everything that takes place within it.  But that's just what makes ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" such a unique and trippy experience.  And besides, it offers a rare glimpse into a scene few of us have any real familiarity with, so whether the thing is real or fake doesn't really matter all that much in the end.  The ""experience"" is what counts with ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" and that, I guarantee you, will be unforgettable.",1298246400,4,2956,4.866
4237096,4,B003ZXNCH2,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The first question in my mind is not whether 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is a hoax, an elaborately staged mockumentary about a French expatriate living in L.A., Thierry Guetta, an amateur filmmaker turned street artist turned Wahol-like pop artist. No, my question is whether the film's creator, 'Banksy', the so-called legendary street artist, is actually a real person. Actually I had never heard of him before this film but then again I don't live in the UK. There's an elaborate biography of him on Wikipedia but who knows whether any of that is true. I've also found articles about him dating back to 2005 but then again, who knows if those articles are fakes also? I'd be more inclined to believe this is the work of prankster Sacha Baron Cohen, famous for his Ali G, Borat and Bruno parodies. If you take a look at the Wikipedia biography, so much of it seems like one joke after another. For example, there's an illustration (supposedly by Banksy) of a naked man on the wall of a sexual health clinic. But here's the kicker--they say that the 'city council' (wherever that may be), ""allowed it to remain"". There's also a footnote that claims that the source of that information is UK/Magazine/Faces of the Week from BBC news from 15 September 2006. [...] Retrieved 12 April 2010. If all the footnotes we find in the Wikipedia article are made up, that's one hell of an elaborate hoax!!!

As for Thierry Guetta himself, is he actually a Frenchman in L.A., who owned a vintage clothing store and who from an early age began videotaping every aspect of his life? I've met a guy who videotapes incessantly and has a collection of videotapes that rival what we see in 'The Gift Shop'. So I know there are people like that. It's possible that the creators here found Guetta, who in fact had a large collection of videotapes that he had shot prior to the creation of 'The Gift Shop', and he agreed to be in on the spoof. Whether at a certain point in his life, he hooked up with his cousin, the graffiti artist in the film, 'Space Invader', who introduced him to other street artists, remains to be seen. I suspect all that footage, including the supposed long association with the real graffiti artist, Shepard Fairey (responsible for the Obama 'Hope' poster) is fake.

The entire way in which Thierry Guetta finally hooks up with the elusive Banksy seems like one big joke (we see Thierry racing over to meet Banksy and he comments how he just has no idea why he wasn't stopped for speeding!). The whole bit about how Banksy and Thierry plant the Guantanamo Bay Detainee doll at Disneyland and how Disney security questioned Thierry for four hours and then let him go, is so absurd that one cannot believe it actually happened. Even more absurd is the idea that suddenly Thierry channels his hidden 'street artist', stops his videotaping and becomes a street artist himself.

Finally, there's the scenario of Thierry morphing into an Andy Warhol type artist and organizing his own art exhibition in Los Angeles. Did it actually happen? Again, the pranksters could have actually gone to great lengths to make the exhibition a success by arranging interviews with the local media and promoting it through street art. Or they could have made it look like it was a success through clever editing. Who knows? There's also a claim that subsequently Thierry designed an album cover for a Madonna greatest hits album. Did that actually happen or is that also part of the hoax? Or was Madonna actually taken in by Banksy pranksters? One thing I'm convinced of--Thierry did not actually create the album (if in fact it actually exists). As it was made clear during the film, the pop art was actually created by people who were hired by either Thierry or Banksy pranksters.

As a mockumentary, 'Exit through the gift shop' may be compared to the iconic 'Spinal Tap'--what 'Tap' did for rock music, 'Gift' has now done for street art. The best one can say for this clever parody, is that it's fun. The worst one can say, is that it doesn't mean that much in the grand scheme of things. I'm more on the side of 'if it's clever and fun', then it's definitely worthwhile seeing.",1298160000,3,4209,4.674763832658569
4237097,4,B003ZXNCH2,"I took a chance on this documentary because both Entertainment Weekly and Netflix recommended it though there was little explanation as to what it is about besides that everyone should see it. After viewing this documentary twice I have to agree, everyone must see this film!

I will try to explain what it is about without giving too much of its intrigue away. Basically, the film starts as a documentary of street art in LA in recent years and the man who filmed it: Thierry Guetta. To say that Guetta is an avid amateur videographer, is a gross understatement. Guetta filmed every waking minute of his life, so when he became interested in street art...her filmed every second of that! Through his obsession, he was able to meet famous street artists including Space Invader, Shepard Fairey and eventually Banksy (the director of Exit Through the Gift Shop). Banksy takes Guetta under his wing and shows Guetta the secret ways of the street artist. Eventually, Guetta is asked what he is doing with all of the film he takes to which he responds that he is making a documentary on street art. It is when Guetta must actually make a documentary that Exit Through the Gift Shop takes an interesting path (I won't spoil it for you here).

There are so many intriguing aspects about this film but I think the most interesting is the current controversy that this entire documentary is just another one of Banksy's pranks. A prank that got him an Oscar nomination...I am not sure if I believe this is not but you don't need to choose a side in order to enjoy this thrilling documentary. It is beautiful in its presentation of street art and its artists. Additionally, it makes the viewer continue to think long after the movie has been taken out of the DVD player.",1297641600,,1761,4.659163987138264
4237098,3,B003ZXNCH2,The movie was good however if I would've known it was going to be a burned copy I would've bought it somewhere else.,1297209600,,116,4.086956521739131
4237099,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Exit Through the Gift Shop opens with a montage of street artists putting their work on display in a number of precarious locations--along the sides of skyscrapers, across street signs, and over ads for beauty products.  Where the artwork is located, whether elevated to improbable heights or splayed across feckless city ads, becomes just as integral to the overall effect of the art as what is pasted or spraypainted by the artists themselves.  In other words, street art might be the first time in the visual art world where the canvass is just as important as what is displayed on it.  It's a suitable beginning to a film that asks us to question what we see in art and in what ways our reactions to artwork are bound up in how it is presented to us.

 Exit Through the Gift Shop centers on Thierry Guetta, a French ex-pat living in Los Angeles, and how he descends into the shadowy world of street artists.  Ever since Thierry had received his first camcorder he found himself self-documenting all aspects of his life.  We learn that most of Thierry's early documenting efforts were mostly of the mundane moments of everyday life, and it wasn't until he made a trip back home to France where he encountered his street artist cousin, Invader, that his videolog started to shape itself into some sort of purpose.  After watching his cousin work, Thierry becomes intrigued by the underground art movement that seems to be hiding in plain site on city signs and skyscrapers.  He begins documenting and obsessively following any and all street and graffiti artists he can find, collecting them like baseball cards (or, Pokemon cards for the kids out there).  He even manages to strike up a friendship with America's most ubiquitous street artist, Shepard Fairey, who is mostly famous for his Andre the Giant and They Live mash up, ""Obey,"" as well as his inescapable red and blue Obama profile.

 In order to find acceptance among the usually reticent group of underground artists, Thierry claims that he is making a documentary.  This sets up a symbiotic relationship between Thierry and the artists he shadows: he needs a subject for his camera and, because of the short lifespan of their artwork, they need documentation.  This leads Thierry to eventually meet the most elusive street artist, Britain's Banksy.  Like most of the street artists featured in the film, Banksy's work is of a distinctly political bent, and perhaps the most memorable moment of the film occurs when Banksy brings an inflatable simulacrum of a Guantanamo prisoner to Disney World.  The presence of a chained and hooded American prisoner in the midst of the most meticulously controlled place on earth naturally erupts into chaos.

 Eventually Banksy encourages Thierry to start making his own artwork, perhaps merely as a means to get rid of him and his pesky camera.  Convinced that art is nothing more than a form of brainwashing, Thierry dubs himself Mr. Brainwash.  After briefly trying his hand at pasting a signature icon around L.A., Mr. Brainwash quickly decides that what he really needs is a gala exhibition.  After recruiting an army of starving artists, Thierry refits an abandoned office building into his own personal art gallery and through the magic of delegation constructs a surprising number of exhibits in a matter of weeks.  And yet despite his relative lack of experience in the art world and his dubious artistic achievements, Mr. Brainwash's show becomes a massive success.  Lines for his show wrap around the block, and his artwork sells for thousands of dollars each.  All of this and no one at the exhibit is quite capable or articulating why Mr. Brainwash is the genius they seem to think he is.

 The central question of the Gift Shop is, how do we value art?  For much of the film this question is on the level of expression.  What does it mean for Banksy to place an image of human depravity, a Guantanamo inmate, in the middle of a make believe world tailor made to help its guests forget about the troubles of the outside?  But by the end of the film that question of value becomes monetary.  We see Thierry walking through his gallery naming a price for his artwork almost at random.  The value of art shifts from a question of interpretation to a question of monetary worth.

 It's this shift in how art is valued that has some people claiming that the film illustrates why artistic value is meaningless.  I disagree with this supposed message of the film.  Clearly from the reactions to Thierry's work by Banksy and Fairey, we are not supposed to take his artistic merit seriously.  In fact, most of Thierry's work looks like bargain bin Andy Warhol.  However, Thierry vaults over his lack of talent by bolstering his project with copious amounts of hype.  Those who visit his gallery are not questioning the artwork itself, but rather its potential cultural and monetary capital.  Exit Through the Gift Shop wants us to ignore the way that celebrity buyers and art investors have obscured our view of art, and instead asks us to view, intently, what is right in front of our eyes.",1296950400,3,5096,4.807118254879449

 finds themselves having to redefine thier conceptual summation of the movie, so much so that a discription of the movie would inevitably be a spoiler to the full enjoyment of the film on its initial viewing.  For myself, when I had to reconceptualize what the film was about it induced a meditation on what art is all about.  I think this is what the filmmaker was going for.  I can't remember another documentary (if you can call it that) that had a similar plot structure.  Surprising and enjoyable.",1296864000,,625,4.636363636363637

4237102,5,B003ZXNCH2,"It's highly likely that this phony Zelig type creation, Mr Brainwash, was intentionally crafted by Bansky and Fairey. If so, well, that would be the ultimate Dada type joke of the millennium on the high-brow/museum/buyer/dealer circuit. Either way, it's a great film and says a lot about art. Shows how drive, more than any thing else, is the line between artist and non artist. Talent, skill, opinion, and all else are just secondary. When anyone produces a pile of art, (some might say junk) they are, for better or for worse, an artist. I think Bansky and Fairey recognize this and they show this no talent Brainwash ""Jeff Koons"" type got a zoo of people to make him into a brand name the masses ate up (supposedly) like garbage. Phony or not, It was entirely fascinating and forces the viewer to consider the idea of art and what it is and why people want it,  just like a gift shop forces you to consider buying something you likely don't need.

Addition...

I suspect it was real and about 2/3 of the way through the real person, video dude is fictionalized as a pseudo street artist Brainwash. It gets too hokey there to be real. The film makers can claim it's ""real"" all they want. They took a real person and made him an artist at the end. That last 1/3 was just too contrived. It's a statement about what is art and whhat exactly makes someone an artist. If they admitted it was partially contrived the discussion would end and it is the debate, the discussion that the filmmaker wants. He wants us to consider the garbage in the gift shop, the art, it's value as a commodity and it's monitory worth. The film was well constructed beyond it's surface and pushes deep into society and art as a reaction and also a sometimes misunderstood esoteric obtuse nonsense juxtapositions, viewed and often misunderstood by non artists and as sometimes mistakenly created by artists in today's directionless over saturated world who many times just do not know what to create, even though they are driven to create something and they don't know why or what to make. Artists with no statement who think art is just about wackiness.",1296086400,,2128,4.639257294429708
4237103,4,B003ZXNCH2,"""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" was made by the British street artist Banksy, apparently out of desperation. While visiting Los Angeles in 2006, Banksy was introduced to a French migr named Thierry Guetta, who compulsively films everything he sees. Thierry had been introduced to street art in 2000 by his cousin, who calls himself ""Invader"" for the Space Invader art that he plasters everywhere. Thierry found a focus: He would film street artists. Back in L.A., he filmed the artist Shepard Fairey and learned the process of making street art in all the best spots in L.A. So, when the celebrated and elusive Banksy needed an assistant, Thierry was the perfect person to show him around the city.

Thierry was supposedly making a documentary about street artists -and epic documentary judging by the quantity of film footage. But when Banksy finally puts Thierry on the spot about the documentary, it becomes clear that Thierry is no filmmaker. He records everything but has no ambitions for his collection of documentary evidence. So Banksy takes on the project himself, sifting through over 10,000 hours of footage. In an inspired moment, Banksy decides that the film should be about Thierry Guetta rather than about street artists. So this compulsive filmmaker who became the documentarian of so many street artists becomes the subject of a street artist documentary.

But the story doesn't end there. While Banksy tries to put the film together, he encourages Thierry to pursue his fledgling artistic ambitions. He doesn't expect that Thierry will take all he has learned from other artists and try to do them one better by producing computer-generated street art on a commercial scale and putting on a huge art show that will net $1 million. Thierry doesn't know much about art or art shows, in fact, but he does understand hype, and, whatever else he may lack, he does have guts. ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" documents these peculiar circumstances and their unlikely outcome and, in so doing, makes a truly strange and insightful comment on the art world.",1295740800,5,2060,5.002915451895044
4237104,2,B003ZXNCH2,"Ostensibly a documentary about street art, ""Exit ..."" morphs into the story of a somewhat deranged poseur named Thierry who fancies himself a street artist after hanging out with a bunch of them.  He re-invents himself as a ""M r. Brain Wash"" or MBW.

The only ones brainwashed -- besides himself in his delusions of talent -- are the suckers paying $20,000 for this ""art"" (sic).

The film evoked in me a ""Spinal Tap"" quality of the absurd, spotlighting relatively untalented folks who harbor delusions of grandeur and significance.

Don't exit through the Gift Shop.  RUN to the nearest exit, regardless of location....",1295308800,10,619,4.970873786407767
4237105,4,B003ZXNCH2,"The fact that this is a Banksy film is misleading, as he is not exactly the focal point. The film details a very strange Frenchman named Tierry who has lately become OBSESSED with video-recording his life. He films every single second of it, afraid that he will lose his family memories and so forth if they are not fastidiously documented. There doesn't seem to be much of an artistic motive at first, until Tierry meets up with his cousin Space Invader, a local street artist, and starts documenting his night-life, scaling rooftops and laying out stencils of his iconic 8-bit themed artwork. Gradually, Tierry is drawn into the world of street art this way. He meets more and more people, most of them shown with their faces obscured to protect them since street art is essentially vandalism in the eyes of the law. One exception is Shepard Ferry, a good looking roguish California artist who did that famous Barack Obama poster we all saw a year ago. Shepard inevitably introduces Tierry to the mad British rebel Banksy, who appears in the film only in a shadowed cloak, his voice ominously deepened electronically. Tierry is excited to meet him and become his merry cameraman and accomplice. He films and films...and films some more.
The film is ultimately an in-depth examination of the way we perceive and develop art. Tierry's inevitably decision to turn the camera on himself is incredibly interesting. As he dons the persona Mr. Brain Wash and starts to make his own bizarre Andy Warhol esque art (a Campbell's Soup icon turned into a spray paint can takes focus in his art show), a lot of his contemporaries, Ferry, Banksy, etc. begin to elicit not a small amount of grumbles. The implication is that they have paid their dues and have inherent messages in their work, Banksy specifically, as his art is almost unanimously anti-corporate and outrageously so (SPOILERS: axed phone booths, kids with balloons painted on the wall of a war zone, a delightful Guantanamo Bay prisoner blowup doll expertly placed in Disney Land providing one of the best scenes of the movie and so forth END SPOILERS). Tierry invades the art world and makes a lot of money. His journey is 100% worth taking, even if you aren't a big fan of modern art. His zeal is infectious and you can't help but be swept along through the madness. Relatedly, if you haven't seen it, check out Banksy's Simpsons couch gag, it is deadly smart.
This film is not ""his"" in the classical sense in that he only cobbled together what Tierry recorded and slapped his name across it, making something so weird and anti-commercial paradoxically acceptable by the masses. Something to think about.",1294790400,,2659,4.820568927789934
4237106,4,B003ZXNCH2,"So there's this French guy (Thierry) who runs a vintage clothing boutique in L.A., and who's obsessed with shooting video.  He captures everything he can - no matter how boring or profound, and just throws his tapes into boxes ... until he finds something fascinating to follow and make a film about, and doesn't have a clue what to do with it.  It turns out his cousin is the semi-famous street artist, ""Space Intruder."" He introduces Thierry to the world of street art, where he ends up meeting Banksy, the most famous and elusive of them all, and gets inspired to be an artist in his own right, whether or not he has anything original to say.  This all takes place as the art market is discovering street art, and what had been transgressive acts of artistic rebellion put up in secret are now becoming costly and coveted and displayed with pride by the same museums that Banksy once had to sneak into in order to place his work.  When Banksy discovers that the guy has no idea how to make the film that this movement calls for with all his material, he decides to take on the task of making the film himself.  It becomes a film about the obsessive guy with a camera who wanted to make a film about street artists and became Mr. Brainwash, either the ultimate con-artist or the true artist who revealed that all art is a con, a ""brainwash scheme,"" and still managed to make money with it.  Of course, as some have alleged, the film itself could be just another Banksy prank.  It's fun to watch and pretty fascinating regardless.

4237114,5,B003ZXNCH2,"What makes art valuable and worthwhile?  Is it skill?  Beauty?  The light it sheds on existence?  Or is it hype?  Marketing?  A genteel mob-mentality?  This is one of the main questions that the wonderful documentary EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP asks...perhaps without knowing it is asking.

Sometimes documentaries are about something and then the filmmaker surprises us with a twist in the story they are documenting.  In this case, the film is about one thing and suddenly it not only turns out to be about something else...it's actually being created by someone else.

The movie starts in 1999, and introduces us to a very eccentric man, Thierry (pronounced more or less ""Terry"") Guetta.  He's a Frenchman who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and 3 kids.  He runs a VERY successful vintage clothing store.  And he's also obsessed with his camcorder.  He films everything around him, all the time.  And it really is an obsession...he films, tosses the full video tape into a box and moves on to the next.  One day, he discovers that his cousin is the well-known graffiti artist Space Invader.  He begins to fill his cousin at work, darting into dark alleys and onto rooftops, putting his video game inspired ""art"" onto buildings...staying one step ahead of the authorities.  Thierry now becomes obsessed with the idea of following these urban artists, and he begins to ingratiate himself with more and more of them.  He's now intent on making a documentary.  And he's also determined to finally meet the most famous graffiti artists of all:  the super-secretive Banksy.

And when the world's and obsessions of these two men collide, the movie takes off in an utterly unexpected way.  I don't want to spoil any more of it for you...when I saw it, I had no idea what to expect.  And I was utterly taken by pleasant surprise when tables (and cameras) were turned.

Let's just say that in part, the movie asks its questions by showing us the work of these street artists.  What they do is generally illegal or nearly so.  But what they do is also often beautiful, powerful, cool, daring, funny and sometimes all of these.  It sure seems like art.  What would make it NOT be art?  The fact that it's illegal?  The fact that it is by its nature transient (so is performing art)?

But with the twists that come later, the movie also asks:  are we, the public, incapable of distinguishing art from hype?  If something grabs our attention in a loud and insistent manner, are we fooled into thinking it's important or meaningful?  Is something full of hype thus incapable of being art?  Is art only art when it become valuable?  Is art only art when it ISN'T valuable?  What is the goal of the artist?  What is the role of the public and the critic?  And so forth.  These questions are never asked explicitly...but they are buried in the fabric of the very interesting story that is being told.

I was initially hesitant to watch the film.  I'm not that interested in graffiti or street art.  I know a lot of it is ""cool"" but I still have trouble with people just assuming they are free to put whatever they want on a public (or private) wall.  If you have the same thoughts as me...don't let that stop you from seeing the film.  It's an exceedingly interesting movie on many levels, and frankly, it stirred me on the same intellectual level as a film such as THE SOCIAL NETWORK or INCEPTION did.  It's also funny.  And, except for a few casually tossed expletives and f-bombs...it's surprisingly tame.  The artwork is never hugely offensive.  I'd have been okay with anyone 14 or older seeing this film...and I would actually advise it.  It's provocative and stimulating, in all the right ways.  Best documentary I've seen in 2010.",1294012800,,3725,4.678516228748068
4237115,5,B003ZXNCH2,"Public space & image appropriater Banksy is either a punk hero or just another mod con on the make. Even he is uncertain just what the difference is, or if indeed there is any real difference. This film (which is itself another example of Banksy's talent for appropriation) is Banksy's way of examining & commenting on his generation's countercultural confusion. Banksy's film shows us that most people in his generation (but especially Thierry Guetta) are more interested in ""hype"" & ""cool"" & ""image"" than they are in any real countercultural message or politics.

In the beginning its Thierry Guetta who wields the camera, but once Bansky identifies Guetta as inept & appropriates his footage, he brings to the project the critical eye & intelligence that Thierry Guetta lacked. The most fascinating thing that Bansky does is turn that critical eye (that is the camera) on himself. So for me, the most interesting section of the film is what Bansky does with Thierry Guetta's documentary footage of his own theft, transformation, & re-installation of a British telephone booth. What Bansky seems to realize while putting this footage together is that he ""Banksy"" has now become so famous that when passersby encounter the hatcheted telephone booth in the middle of London they know it is a ""Banksy"" who created the object. The artist's own reputation/notoriety is what excites people; the actual art object and message are secondary to the growing mystique of the artist. This is one of the many insights afforded by this clever film. And Banksy surely puts the hatchet in his own street artist mystique when he hosts an exhibition of his work in an LA wearhouse. What Banksy seems to be documenting (intentionally or no) is his evolution from street artist to Jeff Koons-styled art brat but not being certain whether this marks a progression or a step backward. So, the film is both a unique and fascinating portrait of the street art & gallery world of the 80's & 90's, but also a self-portrait of the artist at a transitional point in his life & career. Will be interesting to see if Bansky makes more films.

The way Bansky tells the story it would seem that the best street artists (just as artists in other time periods who worked with more conventional methods & mediums) are waging a kind of warfare over the meaning of images & over the way we perceive things & construct our realities. Unfortunately, the people who defuse such movements are often the artists themselves, or at least the hack street artists among them, who are just cashing in on cool.

The best film of the year.",1293753600,,2592,4.833333333333333
4237116,5,B003ZXNCH2,"From the great opening sequence of street artists around the world (esp the guy trying to spray paint at a moving freight train) through the time spent on Shepard Fairey, Invader and Banksy himself, ""Exit"" is a fascinating, inspiring, shrewd and frequently hilarious film. This is a movie that just makes me happy.

As a documentary, it also avoids the trap 90-percent of them fall into, which is having a series of talking heads drone on about this particular person or that particular scene and how something was the be-all/end-all of history.

Instead, ""Exit"" tells a compelling, ongoing story, one that turns into a bit of an ouroboros, as -- in a way -- the center of the story shifts from one subject to an entirely different one. In the process, the film quickly makes a fairly heavy-handed but no less potent statement about art and its value. And despite claims that this movie is a prank in itself, I've read evidence that suggests it all (as they say) really did happen.",1293667200,,981,4.6976744186046515

4237118,4,B003ZXNCH2,"Exit Through the Gift Shop is an incredibly interesting film that begs the question that has been asked millions of times over again: what is art? *sips latt* *adjusts glasses*

The movie starts out as one man's (Thierry Guetta) habit of always carrying a video camera and filming everything around him. He soon accidentally stumbles upon the growing and subversive (an underground word for `underground') world of street art. This habit of his turns into an obsession, as he begins to constantly follow these artists around at night to capture this somewhat mysterious world.

One of the reasons these artists allow him to film them is because street art is a very unique art form in that it is constantly being created and destroyed. When Guetta tells them that he is making a documentary about it, they look at this film as a way to actually preserve their art for once.

There is a problem, however: Guetta isn't a filmmaker at all. In fact, he originally never intended on watching these tapes ever again. He was simply filming for the sake of filming. That is, until he had the opportunity to meet and follow around the most famous and elusive street artist of all time: Banksy. Part director, part watchdog, part instructor, Guetta gives us a glimpse into the world of a reclusive street artist whose work now sells for thousands of dollars at art shows across the world.  And then things start to get interesting... and confusing.

Though Guetta himself filmed most of the footage, it is Banksy who is in the director's chair for this film after he quickly realizes the original man behind the camera is far more interesting than any of the artists who were in front of it. What follows is a fascinating turn of events that culminates into something that is part documentary, part social commentary, and quite possibly part prank. Nonetheless, Exit Through the Gift Shop is an excellent film that makes you question the somewhat arbitrary line that has been drawn between art and vandalism, and how it is often times people's reaction to something that helps draw that  line.",1293494400,,2083,4.804469273743017
4237119,5,B003ZXNCH2,"... a person who goes to the opera a lot, seldom walks on the grass when there's a sign prohibiting it, likes quiet restaurants and clean white restroom walls, and occasionally feels resentful at sprawling graffiti, then this film will challenge your receptivity. It's a generational minder-binder, a challenge to any conservative's most fundamental instinct of order and propriety. It's a film by and about... gasp! ... ""street artists!""

My acrobatic 20-year-old son, who has been a highly-paid 'street performer' at the Circus Festival in Montreal and who used to delight in scratching his name in fresh cement, lured me into watching ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" with him. I doubt I'd ever have known of it otherwise, though I live in a city where murals on any vacant walls are treated with reverence. The director of the film is the mysterious Briton 'Banksy' - a street artist so famous that there are guidebooks to his work in London and protective plastic sheets over his few pieces in San Francisco. Banksy includes himself both as subject and as narrator in his film, electronically muffling his voice and shrouding his face in darkness. Another well-known street artist - Shephard Fairey of Los Angeles - appears openly and turns out to be startlingly clean-cut, the boy next door 1950s style. The prolific Space Invader, whose little mosaics of plastic cubes are everywhere in Paris, plays an essential role in the film as he introduces his 'cousin' Thierry Guetta to the excitement of nocturnal tagging. First challenge here: where are the lines to be drawn between malicious defacement, playful self-assertion, defiant creativity, free-speech demonstration against repressive authority, and the highly skilled art of Banksy and others whose aesthetic includes outlaw outrage? Indeed, are there lines? And who really has the ""right"" to delineate? What art is sacrosanct, if any, and why?

The central character in the film is Thierry Guetta, and the chief enjoyment of the film is the bafflement of trying to make sense of a guy who is either an obsessive-compulsive idiot-savant, or a genius at self-promotion, or a total fluke. Guetta first appears as an immigrant small-business-owner family man who gets a video camera as a gift from his wife and who 'goes nuts' taking pictures of everything everywhere all the time. Eventually he finds his bizarre niche as the documenter of street artists at work. I won't short-circuit the development of his career any further.

The cinematography of this film is as random and amateurish as most street art, and that's exactly what makes it both authentic and fascinating. When one street artist metaphorically scratches his head about the work of another, and declares that the other hasn't 'played by the rules,' you will KNOW that you've wandered into unsurveyed ethical/aesthetic territory.",1292889600,26,2851,5.153347732181426

4237122,5,B003ZXNCH2,"My wife and I heard about Banksy some time ago and were actually anxious just to learn more about his craft and talent. Akin to the main theme of the movie, after watching Exit Through the Gift Shop I think we got what we were looking for, but not quite in the way we expected.

The movie is divided pretty fairly into three equally entertaining sections. The first third introduces the protagonist, Thierry, and sets the background for his obsession with street artists. The middle portion of the movie introduces Banksy and follows the growth of his relationship with Thierry. The final act features Thierry almost exclusively, and while I was sure I knew where the film was going to end up, I found myself anxiously awaiting confirmation (incidentally, I couldn't have been more wrong).

My favorite thing about this excellent film is the conversations it begets once the credits have rolled. Questions are raised about each of the film's featured artists and the art world in general that may not have clear answers, but are entertaining to discuss nonetheless. I appreciated that the film was willing to acknowledge that it didn't have the answers either, especially considering how difficult it must have been to not pretend otherwise.

My wife and I may not agree about exactly what happened at the end of the film or why, but I think we can both agree on one thing after viewing: Banksy is much, much more talented than either of us originally thought (and we thought pretty highly of him before).",1292544000,49,1505,4.803088803088803
4237123,4,B003ZXNCH2,"At times I might be stalled at a railroad crossing waiting for that seemingly endless freight train to pass. I look at the graffiti strewn box cars and marvel at how totally ugly they are. Then one will happen by that was obviously done by someone who had something more in mind. An actual work of art. It reminds me that not everyone indulging in this endeavor is a mindless gang-banger whose only need is to mark his spot.

This is a nifty documentary about an immigrant Frenchman with an obsession for video taping nearly every waking hour of his life. He happens across the ""street art"" thing and now must find these artists and document them and their work. He even manages to spend an enormous amount of time with the king of all street artists, Banksy, as he goes on his night time excursions to place as much art on buildings as possible. He then takes the next leap and becomes an obscenely prolific and popular artist himself.

Living just outside of Chicago, I have seen some really cool building art. Some of it has been every bit as imaginative as its attention grabbing counterparts hanging in pop art galleries, but much of what is shown in this film makes much of what I've seen pale by comparison.

The Frenchman, Thierry Guetta, is a real character. Even with his broken English, he has a way of expressing himself that grabbed my attention. As a successful retailer, he had the means to support his video taping habit which, even he admits, is like a drug. That he finds the subject, street art, that allows him to focus his attention is something everyone gains from. I simply never thought much about street artists and this was a real eye-opener. Many of them are sincere about their format(s) and they are doing a lot to push the envelope. There is a lot of cool and clever artwork shown in this film. Any number of these pieces I would love to have framed and hanging in my home. The act of selling the artwork is what fuels the final act of this documentary.

As Terry shifts from documenter to artist, and produces an expensive, lavish showing of his own work, it brings into question the entire philosophy of street arts and artists. Is Terry any good and should he be doing this? The argument is that he turns the whole idea about street art around and puts it back into a purely commercial pop business. Not where the artists feel it should be.

This is an interesting and informative look at this amazing and unusual segment of the art world. It might not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the arts, this is well worth seeing.",1292457600,,2562,4.477516059957173
4237124,3,B003ZXNCH2,"""The widespread speculation that ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is a hoax only adds to its fascination."" _Roger Ebert

""Is the movie itself a put-on? Several critics have raised the possibility that ""Exit Through the Gift Shop'' is just another Banksy con game, an art-world ""Punk'd'' that lets him and his little pals laugh all the harder at us. I'm not buying it"". _Ty Burr, The Boston Globe

""IS THE MOVIE A PRANK? Yes and no. We think it starts out as a legitimate documentary, with Guetta intending to create a film about street artists. But it eventually becomes clear that he is a very bad filmmaker, and that is where the story begins to diverge from reality.
IS GUETTA FOR REAL, THEN? Yes and no. The beginning of the film is likely accurate, until he meets Fairey, who determines that Guetta means well, but will never be able to produce a finished documentary. Fairey enlists Banksy to help turn it into an actual documentary. The second half of the film, starting from when Guetta meets Banksy, is loosely scripted with the help of Fairey and Banksy. In other words: a prank"". _John Hargrave, ZUG
