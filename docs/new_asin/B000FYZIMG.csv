8127702,5,B000FYZIMG,Really glad I bought this Biography of Patrick Stewart. I had always wanted to see it and never got the chance. I don't have much time for T.V. I know that this is kind of old but it doesn't really matter. It's still good to watch if you are a Patrick Stewart fan. It was worth it.,1263513600,,281,3.9473684210526314
8127703,5,B000FYZIMG,"I would like to say this movie was wonderfully made and I loved it. I love Patrick Stewart and always have and always will. I want to know as much about him as possible. Reading interviews, his bio, watching interviews, watching his bio, joining the fan sites helps me accomplish that. My goal is to know who he is.

Sincerely yours,
