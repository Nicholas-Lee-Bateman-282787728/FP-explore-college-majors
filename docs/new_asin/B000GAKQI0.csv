8129916,4,B000GAKQI0,Really enjoyed the movie and my purchase. Raquel Welch and John Paul Belmondo made a comedic match. I had been wanting to  see this movie  and couldn't find it anywhere even at the film rental places. Why wasn't it released in the U.S.? I wished Raquel would have made comedies in the U.S. like this one. She looked incredible! Belmondo was very sexy. The story line was great!,1376352000,,377,4.529411764705882
8129917,5,B000GAKQI0,"A film I have been after for some time. A good story line, and the beautiful Raquel wearing a lot of sexy outfits. The film was in good condition and I'd recommend it to anyone if they have an hour or two to pass.",1314057600,,213,3.8636363636363638
8129918,4,B000GAKQI0,"I've seen this movie ""L'animal"" in 1977 in Europe and absolutely loved it!

Belmondo and Raquel Welch made a perfect 'Beauty and the Beast' couple: she was stunning and he was ugly as hell and funny.

The strange thing about this DVD that the scene described on the DVD cover, where Mike Gaucher pretends not to be able to hear, speak and walk to get a welfare didn't  appear on the DVD. It's a shame!

The quality of the DVD itself is extremely bad! It looks like that this copy has been made from the TV. I should try to get another one from a different producer hoping to find a better quality of one of my favorite comedies of all times.",1293753600,,641,4.229508196721311
8129919,4,B000GAKQI0,"This is a movie that I saw maybe 20 years ago.  I enjoyed it very much.  It stars Raquel Welch and Jean Paul Belmondo.  It never seemed to make it as a great movie but it was a very entertaining situation/comedy.  Raquel was very believable with her part and Jean Paul was very funny.  I tried to buy it soon after I had seen it but it was not available anywhere I checked on it.  The video places could not even locate it in their files.  Some of the places even thought I was making up this movie because it was not listed as one of the movies that either actor even made.

Then about a year ago I found it listed with Amazon.com.  The price was excellent and I ordered it.  I have watched it twice since.  I think it is great!",1270944000,,729,4.027972027972028
8129920,4,B000GAKQI0,"Here is a fun movie with the classic bombshell Raquel Welsh, Its fun to watch and has some of the sexiest video moments of Raquel ever wearing a nearly see through wed dress. Gota love that Raquel.",1223424000,,197,4.351351351351352
