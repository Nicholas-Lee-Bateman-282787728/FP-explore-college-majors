8172291,2,B000MTT2O4,"This is a WWII documentary.  It has lots of shots of cannons going off, battleships firing, planes bombing things, and Hilter and the Germans walking around feeling all proud of their silly uniforms.

What was really annoying about this video was that the audio didn't have enough commentary and it had way too much loud music.  (By loud, I mean that the music was much too loud in comparison to the commentary.)

Furthermore, the music was of the annoying and inappropriate ""isn't it great to go off into war"" type that trivialized the subject matter.  I kept wanting to just turn off the audio, but then I'd miss the snippets of commentary.",1198454400,,642,4.696428571428571
