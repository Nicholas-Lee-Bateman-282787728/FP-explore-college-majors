6120980,5,B00GWXI1AK,"After watching (genuinely, truly, and fully) the final series (all of the episodes), what a fitting tribute this is to the world's most famous detective.  David Suchet is the quintessential Poirot.  This final series culminates in ""Curtain,"" Poirot's final case, and well done, it is. And as icing on this genre's cake, Capt. Hastings, Inspector Japp, and Miss Lemon join in in the valedictory.  For Poirot followers, this is a remarkable--and memorable--exit.  Viva la Poirot!",1389052800,269,477,5.32

Thank you to David, Hugh (Hastings), Pauline (Ms. Lemon), Philip (Inspector Japp), and Zoe (Ms. Oliver).  Thank you all for giving us 26 years of good television, mystery, and drama. And to the directors, producers, and casting directors, thank for choosing the right actors. A&E, PBS and Masterpiece Theater, thank you as well. You all have bought so much intertainment into my life, with little to look at on T.V. I always was interested in the next episode of Poirot. Thank you once again.",1388793600,348,617,4.757009345794392

I will watch each episode if this last series with joy and saddness.  ""Tis curtains"" as they say, the end is near.  On the upside I can go back and start all over as this series will now complete my collection of this incredible journery of Mr. Hercule Poirot and his band of loyal helpmates insolving delicious crimes.  Bravo!",1388534400,132,497,4.666666666666667
6120984,5,B00GWXI1AK,"For me David Suchet is the very personification of Hercule Poirot a bit foppish and festitous but always totally lovable.  David Suchet has amassed a truly astonishing body of work in the many Poirot Series installments and while ALL installments are good most episodes are great and no David Suchet Poirot episode has ever fallen flat in my opinion. I preordered these Agatha Christie's Poirot, Series 12 and Agatha Christie's Poirot, Series 13 DVD's because David Suchet as Hercule Poirot on DVD has NEVER EVER DISAPPOINTED ME!

It appears these final DVD's will be the best production values allowing our dear Hercule to go out on the high note.  In show business it is said that one should always leave us wanting more.  I want MORE David Suchet as Hercule Poirot but fully understand David's desire to close this chapter of life and move on.  I just want to thank David Suchet and all that have worked to bring us Hercule Poirot DVD's over the years.

I thank A&E, Granada, Acorn Media and others for always delivering DVD's of ok to awesome quality.  Unlike many studios the exec's never jerked us fans around on release date and price. David Suchet's role of  Hercule Poirot collectors were always treated with respect. All the DVD's were watchable or better in quality.  The Hercule Poirot DVD's were always a class act in execution and delivery.  I rarely write a review this glowing but there are few series like POIROT protrayed by a great man like David Suchet.  David Suchet made me love tiny Belgum by making Hercule Poirot so passionate in his love of home country.  I hate to say this but Hercule Poirot had lots of autistic qualities not saying he is one of us but he sure has lots of our ways.

Thanks David Suchet. David may God bess grant you a long healthy happy life.  You have made life much better by your gift of Hercule Poirot given to all of us who appreciate the unique life you breathed into him.",1387843200,232,1925,4.607038123167156

6121024,5,B00GWXI1AK,"I really cannot add much to the praise of this series: indeed, I have all of the the films and shorter programs on DVD, and they are cherished. Each time I reach the end...CURTAIN: POIROT'S LAST CASE...it is almost with a certain sadness, as if I am saying good-bye to an old and delightful friend. Along with MISS MARPLE (I prefer the sets with Joan Hickson), these on screen representations of Dame Agatha's works remain a monument to what can be done to produce intriguingly good crime drama. David Suchet will ever remain for me ""Hercule Poirot,"" even as I return to the books that I purchased years ago....

I do have one question that perhaps a viewer may answer: in CURTAIN  there is a piano piece that opens and closes the film. I have heard it played before, indeed, I may have it on CD, but for the life of me I cannot remember the title. Is it by Chopin (as I suspect)? Of, if not Chopin, perhaps Schubert? Might some other reviewer/reader enlighten me?  My thanks....",1498348800,,979,4.48876404494382

6121131,5,B00GWXI1AK,"You cannot think of Poirot without thinking of David Suchet. In this last episode, I too like so many dreaded this final goodbye to our dearest friend. The complexity of his performance never missed a beat. Let's not forget Hugh Fraser who played Arthur Hastings with such ease , the perfect foil for Poirot.
This last episode was staged in a depressing run down hotel. This was supposed to take place where years ago Poirot and Hastings came together for the first time. I am not sure if it was filmed at the same location as I saw little resemblance to that home. I wish some mention was said of the former inhabitants and how they came to do this to their home. In the episode if you will remember the owner of the home was poisoned by her new husband and his lover ( the companion to the lady). However, in the last episode when someone questions Poirot about that murder he states she was most cruel to her adopted children. The writer obviously mixed that episode up with Appointment with Death. I found this particularly annoying that no one in the production caught this error.
Captain Hastings daughter was a character that elected no sympathy from me. Her heartless rankings about the infirm needing to be done away with, the cold hearted Doctor she was enamored with, and most of all her treatment of her father, one of the most like able characters written.
She showed no sentiment toward ant mention of her deceased mother nor any care or concern for anyone but herself. For such a dedicated scientist she was certainly out of control most of the time.
The murderer was played with such skill that I disliked him so intensely.
The moral dilemma that Poirot faced was to me out of character and had colored the last few episodes with this judgemental and intolerant Poirot that is in the case of Murder on the Orient Express. Which was the most I looked forward to watching and was so disappointed with our compassionate  and oh so human Poirot becoming a caricature out of the inquisition.
But maybe this was the setup to let us know the ultimate sacrifice Poirot made for a greater good. I hope against hope their will be found a lost manuscript or two of Agatha Christies featuring Poirot with Miss Lemon, Japp, and Hastings older and wiser coming in for another round.",1475020800,,2284,4.5843520782396086

6121315,5,B00GWXI1AK,"Well as the character Q put it to Captain Picard in ""All Good Things"" a final episode of Star Trek The Next Generation: "" Captain, All Good Things Come to an End, "" and so it is with M. Suchet and our beloved Poirot. I live how in Ep. 6 he explained how well he loved the character so much so that he filmed the end first and insisted when the final season came about the BBC would let him do so. I've been an Agatha Christie fan since childhood and I knew that one day eventually her final book on Poirot would be made. That Mrs. Christie just like Charles Schulz the ""Father"" of 'Peanuts' cartoons would end their series on their own terms not leaving it to another to complete after their lifetime was over. And so it is with ""Curtain"" the final case. Brilliantly played the 13th season by all those actors. As one person wrote ""All good thongs come to and end , even a book we relish no matter how long we deter reading the last pages. "" The end is always near but what a satisfying ending indeed. Bon M. Suchet and all those we watched ""play the game"" as Poirot says the English play! lol",1460851200,,1093,4.160377358490566

6121526,5,B00GWXI1AK,"Upon watching the 2015 Emmy Awards, I noted that ""Curtain"" had been nominated. I was amazed to discover that all of the Hercule Poirot novels and short stories (except one) had been made by ITV, starring David Suchet. While all of the stories on this DVD are extremely well done, I purchased this DVD (prior to starting with Series 1) just to see ""Curtain."" I received the novel, ""Curtain"" when it was released, after the passing of Dame Agatha Christie, and was not disappointed in the story, as written for broadcast, shown on this DVD. The same is true for the portrait of Poirot in all four of the mysteries shown on this DVD, as well as every other DVD in the series. Just as in the book, the viewer is given the ""perfect crime...almost."" A small spoiler/hint: this plot closely utilizes the type of villain as portrayed in Shakespeare's ""Othello."" If you purchase a ""package"" set, make sure that you don't purchase a duplicate copy in this series. I have been watching the character of Hercule Poirot evolve since shooting began in the late 1980's to 2013. I highly recommend the series for you mystery buffs, especially if you've only seen Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov portraying the role...Suchet IS Poirot!",1446336000,,1218,4.75

6121599,3,B00GWXI1AK,"I've read every Agatha Christie book many times over and Hercule Poirot has always been my favorite character  Lovers of his series have gotten used to how he talks and operates. I understand the desire to modernize his character to appeal to a new audience but in series 13 some of the integrity of the stories were lost. Particularly in The Labors of Hercules was this most evident. Christie always underplayed the violence in favor or the puzzle. She avoided mentioning details that were unsavory. That was part of the appeal. Add to that the fact that the story of Labors was completely unrecognizable! I will always watch anything Poirot, but perhaps enjoy more the ones that maintain the flavor of the original character.

6121786,5,B00GWXI1AK,"While it is true that I watched most of the Poirot series on Netflix, I had to purchase the final two series on DVD because they are not yet available for viewing on Amazon instant video.  They are well worth purchasing.  This is the final series.  There are five roughly 90 minute movies with a bonus 20 minute interview with David Suchet.  Well, not really an interview, but him responding to common fan questions, which are presented written out on the screen and then him commenting.

These mysteries are each  based on novels rather than short stories and hold up well for the extended length of each episode or movie.

Elephants Can Remember is the last of the Poirot novels published except for Curtain, which was written decades earlier, but published last for obvious reasons.  It is a fascinating story about an engagement and a decades old murder or suicide or what?  Everything seems lost or hidden or shrouded in secrets no one wants to divulge.  Who has the truth?  Poirot will unravel all.

The Big Four is a novel that began life as a series of short stories.  It is about a supposed crime syndicate or cabal running the world and driving it towards war.  Does it exist?  Is someone using its reputation to hide his or her own crimes?  Is the mad genius to brilliant for even Poirot?

Dead Mans Folly - Poirot is asked to come help by his friend, mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver.  She has been asked to put together a murder mystery party for the guests to solve, but Ariadne suspects a real murder is about to happen.  Poirot is perplexed on how he is to solve a crime that has not yet occurred and might well never occur.

The Labours of Hercules has Poirot in the Swiss Alps trying to identify a vicious mastermind of an art and jewel thief.  He is feeling a bit undone because he had promised to protect a young woman who had acted as bait for the police but was killed despite Poirots attendance.

Curtain: Poirots Last Case is a return to Styles where a sick and ailing Poirot confronts a person addicted to murder but who gets away with it because somehow they are never connected to the violence.

I loved these episodes and will enjoy them again.  I think you will, too.

Enjoy.

6121888,5,B00GWXI1AK,"This 3 disc set features the last of the cases with Poirot and his portrayer David Suchet

I have always enjoyed this British series and now I have watched this final set of mysteries

The first show is Elephants Can Remember where a couple dies, was it suicide?  A bossy
woman seeks out mystery writer Ariadne Oliver to inquire about her goddaughter Celia
Ravencroft, who is the daughter of the dead couple and wonders if the parents killed
each other.  This leads Mrs. Oliver to seek out her good friend Hercule Poirot, who is
working out a different case which intersects with Madame Oliver's.

The next one is The Big Four where Poirot is reunited with his old friends Hastings,
Japp, and Miss Felicity Lemon as they are called together one last time - - hold
on, Poirot is DEAD???  How did he die?  Just who is the Big Four?  Can they be
stopped?

The third is Dead Man's Folly.  Mrs. Oliver comes to stage a murder mystery for a
strange family that lives at Nasse House where there are more secrets that meets
the eye. . .

The fourth is The Labours of Hercules.  When a case ends in tragedy, Poirot is beside
himself until he seeks out a lady's maid who has disappeared for a lovesick young man.

The fifth and last one is Curtain.  Poirot has brought Hastings back to Styles for one
last case - there will be a murder, but Poirot does not know who the murderer is
or who will be murdered.  Can Poirot solve this last case?

I also love the interview with David Suchet and the photo gallery.  Must watch if you
love mysteries and Poirot!",1433030400,2,1544,4.380281690140845

6122006,4,B00GWXI1AK,"I love the Poirot series, have every episode on disc, not all on Blu Ray yet but I am working on that. There is one set I won't buy as I find the stories substandard. This set of movies, Series 13 are well done and I enjoy them very much, although there are similar setups; a house full of suspects, what happened and why? Poirot in his element. One movie he appears to have died but comes through unscathed with criminal in tow.

The only one I didn't like was the last one, Curtains: Poirot's Last Case, not written by Christie and one which I think she would NEVER have written. It goes against everything Poirot stands for: Law abiding morality.

In the interview with actor Suchet, which is done rather oddly with the interviewer and questions asked off screen, the man playing Poirot says he is protective of the Poirot image and would fight vigorously for that image. What happened here?. I would love to know if he argued against the last movie. I say that it is out of character for Poirot to have done what he did and it bothers me very much. You cannot take a beloved character who is highly moral, in recent movies we have found him to be a Catholic with strong beliefs, then have him commit the crime of murder. Remember how bad he felt in just allowing the killers on The Orient Express to go free?

Maybe the producers and writers came up with this scenario to shock us? Shock isn't needed, we love the guy. Maybe the rationale behind the act isn't given enough support to allow us to understand how such a thing could happen. Are there instances where I would protect others and take the law in to my own hands? Possibly, but I doubt to that extent. There are lawful ways to deal with criminals and Poirot knows every one of the ways. The idea that he would kill just does not work for me, it is not in his nature. I am positive a story sticking to Poirot's moral base could have been done instead, but someone decided to ruffle some feathers, to shock, give a new dimension to the character. But as a killer? Every killer has a reason for their actions, except for psychopaths, but being justified does not make it right and Poirot has a mind that is highly structured, in today's language he is OCD, possibly having Aspergers Syndrome. He would never condone murder in any form. For me, the TV Poirot has come to a bad end.",1430524800,3,2341,4.364678899082569

I'll miss him so much, he protrays this character so well. I love murder,mystery,horry movies and Poirot donst give ya clues ... We'll miss you Mr Suchet, Bless you on your next adventures.  This is a must. very very good movies.",1424995200,,394,4.472222222222222
6122332,4,B00GWXI1AK,"Elephants Can Remember -  Christie had a penchant for murder in retrospect, this story is imho the least of those.  It's ridiculously easy to solve and not terribly evocative, as her other such novels, Five Little Pigs;  Sad Cypress;  Sleeping Murder.  This film version is beautifully photographed and costumed, as always;  acting above par.  It's only my lukewarm feelings about this story that hold back a glowing review.

The Big Four - a silly conspiracy-theory story, this drags on and on until mercifully, it ends.  This film is also very well done, but the story, uninspired.  Not the fault of the filmmakers.

Dead Man's Folly - this is a very good version of one of her better stories featuring Ariadne Oliver, well played by Zoe Wannamaker.  Sin&eacute;ad Cusack walks off with this one, turning in a standout performance as Mrs. Folliat.  Truer to the source material than the Ustinov version (ruined by the annoying Jean Stapleton) this is a very good film.

The Labours of Hercules - I dunno where the producers/writers got the plot for this one, because originally the book published under this title was comprising short stories.  This film manages to tie up some loose ends in Poirot's life, but I found it on the whole, unsatisfying.

Curtain - I read this book once many years ago.  Rereading was unnecessary because this story stuck.  A.C. was a huge Shakespeare fan and Curtian is her homage to that talented student of human nature.  I loved this film because it was true to the very difficult plot.  This mystery is a creeper and could have been helped along by greater exposition at the start (in the book, Poirot tells Hastings a little more about the underlying, past events, including the connection between them, though he refuses to identify the murderer to Hastings.  Suchet and Fraser are absolutely brilliant.  Yes, the film is dark, but the story is ever so much darker.  Although (again imho) Adien McCardle was too young for the part he played (based on the book) he was absolutely exceptional.  The one huge change made to the film version was doubtless to accommodate Poirot's recently discovered devotion to Catholicism despite the fact that, although a Catholic, Poirot's religious practices were rarely mentioned by the author and he was never portrayed as devout and pious (and never holier-than-thou) until the very unsatisfying MOTOE in this series.  However, this alteration in the story, surprisingly, did not jar or otherwise seem out of place.  An exceptional swansong for a largely exceptional series.  All in all, in 70 films, only four were stinkers;  all have great production values.",1424995200,2,2635,4.967963386727689

6122416,5,B00GWXI1AK,"I was a teenager when my teacher of a British lit class I had to take in High School handed me my first Agatha Christie novel.  It wasn't a Poirot, in fact it would be a few years before I first read one of his books.  But, that teacher started me on a life long love for Agatha Christie.  I have read almost all of her books, including all of the Miss Marple and Hercule Poirots, and seen almost all adaptions of both.  Their are two over riding truths- there was only one great Miss Marple, Joan Hickson, and only one Poirot that mattered, David Suchet.  All this leads up to this DVD set.  I have seen a number of things recently including on the set where Suchet talks about playing and becoming Poirot.  I have seen comments by Agatha Christie's family that they truly with that she could have seen him in the role because she would have loved him and seen her Poirot in him.  These last five adaptions of Poirot stories were really good, although I thought ""The Labors of Hercules"" may have altered the book too much.  The real star of the set is ""Curtain"".  It is hard not to know the ending, but it is literally an end to the series.  I knew how it ended from having read the book a long time ago, but it was still a shock.  I was hoping they would film this before something might happen to David Suchet, but it's still sad to see the end of easily one of the greatest series of mysteries ever.  If you're not careful, the ending will make you cry.  I'm not ashamed to admit that it did that for me.",1421452800,3,1508,4.173010380622838

6122512,5,B00GWXI1AK,"I've been a Hercule Poirot fan since seeing Murder on the Orient Express in the movies way back in 1974.  But no matter how much I enjoyed the film interpretations of Poirot, nothing comes close to the magnificent portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective by the great David Suchet.  I've seen every episode of Poirot on tv and dvd and I continue to marvel at the way he becomes this very eccentric character, the same way I marveled at Jeremy Brett's performance as the other great detective, Sherlock Holmes.  Both are amazing actors.
Sadly this has now come to an end with the final 5 Poirot episodes on this blu-ray including ""Curtain,"" Poirot's last case.  Two of the episodes on this set were shown on PBS, three were not including ""Elephants Can Remember,"" ""The Labours of Hercules,"" and ""Curtain.""  If for whatever reason you are just sitting around waiting for PBS to show the other three, than I feel sorry for you because the final three episodes are truly excellent.  I particularly loved ""The Labours of Hercules"" which had Poirot follow a vicious thief and murderer to a resort high up in the Alps which, (like ""Murder on the Orient Express,"") gets snowed in by an avalanche.  The episode looked like it was filmed on location and the production design was truly excellent.  Obviously ""Curtain"" is terrific as well.  I remember reading this book in the 1970s when it was originally published.  I am happy to say that I did not remember the shocking conclusion.
Also on the blu-ray is a 19 minute interview with David Suchet, an actor I truly admire.  I wouldn't cross the street to see many of the tv and movie superstars of today, but Suchet's performance over the years as Poirot is truly incredible.  When one sees him in the interview without the mustache and speaking in his normal British accent, it is hard to believe it is the same person.
So the Agatha Christie Poirot stories are exhausted.  Perhaps someone will write some new Poirots and they will be able to film some more (with Suchet, of course.)  If not, we have all of the wonderful episodes on DVD and blu-ray to watch over and over.
As stated before, if you really love this character and this magnificent series, you really should pick up this final set.",1420243200,3,2237,4.673469387755102

6122576,4,B00GWXI1AK,"My rating for this set would have been five-stars, but for one messed-up episode.

I was especially looking forward to two of the episodes in this collection, Curtain and The Big Four. I should have known when I saw that Mark Gatiss was writing The Big Four that it would be a disaster. And it was. Based on what he has helped to do to Sherlock Holmes, it was obvious that this would be just as bad. (Well, actually nothing is as bad as what theyve done to Sherlock Holmes.) I suppose that Im glad that someone kept Mr. Gatiss from placing Poirot in the year 2014 and tucking a cell-phone up under his long flowing hair while babbling on and on about his OCD.

As a viewer and owner of all of the David Suchet Poirot films, and also having read every single original Poirot short story, novel, and even play multiple times, I understand the need to make some changes when transitioning from page to screen. Some of the original short stories were so short that they had to be padded or changed for television. When some of them were pretty much rewritten as completely original teleplays instead of presenting the original material, I was just happy to have substantially new Poirot stories, even if they were presented under the same titles as previously printed works. I even understood why The Labors of Hercules in this set was adapted the way it was. (That book of short stories should have been made into a whole 12-episode series on its own, and since it remains essentially unfilmed at the end of the process, to my mind Suchet did NOT end up playing Poirot in every story as he has indicated. Still, it was an amazing run.)

But the episode The Big Four was different. There were parts of it that should NOT have been changed or eliminated. Enter Mark Gatiss, who has stated that the novel of The Big Four was an almost unadaptable mess. He certainly unadapted it, all right. Theres a reason certain books and characters are beloved across generations, and it constantly amazes me that script writers think that they can do better than the original authors when messing up original material that has millions of loyal followers for a reason.

In spite of what they had to work with, the cast and crew did an amazing job with The Big Four. I give them all the credit in the world. There are many reasons to be sad about the end of Poirot, but one happy thought is that theres nothing left for Mark Gatiss to touch. Its too late to save Sherlock Holmes from him, but at least  in this case  the book is closed.",1419897600,,2517,4.460869565217391

Poirot is my favorite Agatha Christie character and Agatha Christie is my favorite mystery author. These ""newer"" Poirot episodes reflect neither the books nor the David Suchet character that we have come to love and revere over the last decades. The new seasons seem to be a misguided attempt to replicate the success of other modern, re-imagined BBC series, such as the ""darker"" Sherlock Holmes and the more intense Doctor Who. This David Suchet has no humor, no charm, no clear moral compass and more blatant political positions. The plots are more intense, more sexual, more sinister, and, worst of all, not very much like the actual stories on which they are allegedly based. Suchet's Poirot created one of my favorite TV and movie story lines of all time.

6122829,4,B00GWXI1AK,"After 24 years and 70 episodes, ""Poirot"" comes to an end in Series 13 (Season 12 on PBS). There are five 90-minute films, some based on Agatha Christie's novels and some composites of various short stories. Unsurprisingly, the quality is uneven. ""The Big Four"" uses characters and events from the 1927 novel of the same name and arranges them into a new plot, using the opportunity to reintroduce some old faces, but neither Poirot nor the mystery come off well. ""Dead Man's Folly"" closely follows the 1956 novel and is the best of the bunch. ""Elephants Can Remember"" is based on the 1972 novel but is complicated by an additional murder that would have been better left out. ""The Labors of Hercules"" incorporates plot elements from four different short stories from that 1947 collection. They are admirably intertwined, but the culprit is obvious, the resolution unsatisfying, and the entire episode is grim. ""Curtain"" is a faithful adaptation of the 1975 novel depicting Poirot's last case, though the characterization of Capt. Hastings' daughter is off-putting. A mixed bag.

The episodes are:

""The Big Four"" briefly unites some people from Poirot's past: Chief Inspector, now Assistant Commissioner Japp (Philip Jackson), Poirot's former secretary Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran), and old friend Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser). Poirot runs into Japp at a chess match hosted by the Peace Party to demonstrate good will between East and West. Japp is providing the security, when the guest Russian chess champion (Michael Culkin) collapses dead at the table. Poirot determines that it is murder, the chief suspects being Abe Ryland (James Carroll Jordan), the Peace Party's mysterious wealthy benefactor, and Madame Olivier (Patricia Hodge), a famed French neuroscientist and prominent member. Hack journalist Tysoe (Tom Brooke) is pursuing a vendetta against Ryland and has been receiving threatening letters from a criminal syndicate calling itself ""The Big Four"", who have also taken responsibility for the Russian's murder as well as other recent incidents of criminal havoc.

""Dead Man's Folly"" finds Poirot summoned to Devonshire by his friend, the novelist Ariadne Oliver (Zoe Wannamaker). Miss Oliver has been asked to organize a Murder Hunt, instead of the traditional treasure hunt, for a fair that will be hosted at Nasse House. But she cannot shake the feeling that a real murder plot is afoot, as everyone concerned has made specific suggestions about how and where the murder should take place. The fair in progress, Lady Hattie Stubbs (Stephanie Leonidis), the simpleton wife of estate owner Sir George Stubbs (Sean Pertwee), goes missing. Poirot and Oliver discover the dead body of 14-year-old Marlene Tucker (Ella Geraghty), who was to play the murder victim in the hunt. George's sharp secretary Miss Brewis (Rebecca Front) thinks Hattie more clever than she looks and figures her to have run off. But DI Bland (Tom Ellis) presumes Hattie dead, and her cousin Etienne de Souza (Elliott Barnes-Worrell) is arrested for both murders.

Crime novelist Ariadne Oliver is accosted by a Mrs. Burton-Cox (Greta Scacchi) at a cocktail party in ""Elephants Can Remember"". Mrs. Burton-Cox' son Desmond (Ferdinand Kingsley) is engaged to Oliver's goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft (Vanessa Kirby), and it seems that her future mother-in-law is concerned about a family scandal, the murder-suicide of Celia's parents 13 years ago. Meanwhile, Poirot has been summoned by a psychiatrist friend, Dr. Willoughby (Iain Glen), whose father, a retired psychiatrist himself, has been found murdered at the institute bearing their name. When Celia also expresses a desire to understand the circumstances of her parents' deaths, Oliver asks for Poirot's help in the investigation. But he is busy on the other case, so Oliver sets out to interview anyone who knew Lady and General Ravencroft at the time of their deaths and finds the human memory to be less than reliable or straightforward.

""The Labours of Hercules"" finds Poirot wracked with guilt after failing to protect a woman whose jewels were used as bait for the murderous master thief known as ""Marrascaud"". In order to atone for his failure, Poirot decides to help his distraught driver Ted Williams (Tom Austen) locate his lost love. While driving for Russian ballerina Katrina Samoushenka (Fiona O'Shaughnessy), Williams fell in love with her maid Nita but has been unable to contact her since she departed for Switzerland. Poirot travels to the ""Hotel Olympos"", a grand establishment perched high in the Swiss Alps, where Samoushenka is rumored to be. On his way up the mountain, he spots his old acquaintance Countess Vera Rossakoff (Orla Brady). Wanting to be reacquainted, the Countess settles at the hotel with her daughter Alice Cunningham (Eleanor Tomlinson), a criminologist. Meanwhile, the Swiss police have an undercover agent at the hotel trying to apprehend Marrascaud.

Poirot solves his last case in ""Curtain"". He has invited his old friend Capt. Hastings to visit at Styles House, the scene of the first crime they solved together in 1916, when Hastings was convalescing there from War injuries. The country guest house is now owned by Col. and Daisy Luttrell (John Standing, Anne Reid). Also staying at the house are Hastings' grown daughter Judith (Alice Orr-Ewing), her employer Dr. John Franklin (Shaun Dingwall), his invalid wife Barbara (Anna Madeley), and Barbara's friend Sir William Boyd Carrington (Philip Glenister). Elizabeth Cole (Helen Baxendale), with a mysterious past, Stephen Norton (Aidan McArdle), an awkward but perceptive man, and the flirtatious Maj. Allerton (Matthew McNulty) round out the guests. Poirot tells Hastings that he expects another murder to take place in the house. He needs Hastings to be his eyes and ears now that Poirot is wheelchair-bound, suffering from arthritis and heart problems.",1416700800,3,5894,5.298395721925134

6122848,4,B00GWXI1AK,"This film is somewhat different than the unusual Poirot because Poirot is depressed after failing to save the life of a young women and failing to stop the theft of a valuable painting and jewels. It also contains a woman who Poirot once loved. It is called The Labours of Hercules because of the theft of a painting with that name and because it refers to the labors of Hercule Poirot.
 There are essentially five plots, all of which virtually all viewers will be unable to anticipate their ending until Poirot reveals them to us.  (1) Is he able to find the murderer who killed the girl and stole the painting and jewels? (2) Can he help the Swiss police find a mass murderer? (3) Is he able to find a girl who disappeared and who is being pinned after by a chauffeur?  (4) Can he sort out some other minor thefts?

What an incredible disappointment!

So dark! Just icky. Agatha must be spinning in her grave. Who (rewrote) wrote these? Some psychopath? Poirot seems like a completely different character. This simply is not him!
The story lines are almost impossible to follow. The motives are murky. Nobody seems to have a speck of morals or ethics. Nobody smiles. There is no trace of lightness or humor. Over all lies a heavy blanket of sadism. Gross!
 If these were the first videos I had seen of this series, I would never have ordered the others. It is heavy, dark, and ultimately pointless.

So far I have only watched Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four and Dead Man's Folly. Dead Man's Folly seemed to be pretty close to the book, although I am now re-reading it to make sure. However, Elephants Can Remember and The Big Four have been totally rewritten, changing the whole view of the stories. In Elephants Can Remember, the murder of the doctor that opens the film is not in the story at all and the Big Four was a terrible adaptation. As Talulah Winter said, Agatha Christie is rolling over in her grave, and I would add that so is her daughter. Rosalind, who was very protective of her mother's work.  If one has not read any of Agatha Christie's books, these productions would not be too bad, and David Suchet is, as always, a perfect Poirot. I wish, however, that these had stayed true to their source.

It is a very dark story with a real surprise ending. Poirot's inner demons, drives him to perform an act that is shockingly so unlike him. In the end, justice is ultimately achieved, but not in the usual ""Poirot""  way. It is a poetic end, yet sad.

I since have spent this last year reading and watching every book and every show/movie MANY TIMES over! David Suchet is Hercules Poirot personified. I can not imagine another actor playing this part, Suchet is perfect. I enjoy the early years with Captain Hastings. During their first years filming together it was almost comedy. When Suchet went on his own, changed Butler's and apartments it seems his personality and demeanor became serious to the extreme. Not wanting to go through every show, but wanting to state that their seems to be inconsistencies in Poirot s personality from one minute to the next. I imagine it was due to the writing. I have enjoyed watching 'my' Poirot movies over and over and seem to find that I missed a bit here and there, never tiring of my favorites. The Blue Train, Adventures of the Tomb, Death on the Nile and of course... The Orient Express to name a few... I am grateful that David Suchet played this very important character for so long, never worrying that it may pigeon hole him into only one role, THANK YOU MR. SUCHET. And the always fun 'Ariadne Oliver' are in some of my favorite shows. The settings where these were filmed were EXQUISITE and each and every item that appeared on film was original or looked original for that time period, BRAVO to the set designers, dressers and all the behind-the-scenes people who made it all come together.

They changed it so that the Big Four was really just a product of the crazy man who was number 4 made the whole thing up to impress a girl and kidnapped and drugged #2 and #3 to be props in his plot. I would be writing all night if I told you all of the changes.

6122921,5,B00GWXI1AK,"Poirot, although fictional, made front page news with his obit. Series 13 has David Suchet in the last 5 of his 70 episode appearances as Hercule Poirot. Poirot became the 1st novel protagonist to have a front page obit (NYTimes, Aug 6 1975). This was 2 months prior to Agatha Christie's book ""Curtain"" release, but written pre-mortem in the mid-1940's anticipating the eventual demise of the character's series. Now all have been film adapted and on DVD as well, with Suchet in the Poirot role.
Adaptation screenwriting has been ramped up to accommodate the huge guest star cast list. Well done by all, even down to the camera work. This set includes a filmed Suchet interview while on the set of one of the episodes in this final series. There lies the only fault, as there are 100's more questions to ask of Suchet after starring as Poirot for 70 stories.

SDH SUBTITLES for 5 final episodes, and so many guests, some of my favorites listed.
=1= Elephants Can Remember ==In 1938 Poirot is called to a murder scene, soon to join Ariadne Oliver (Zoe Wanamaker -also appears in 3rd ep) to find the truth about 2 1925 mysterious deaths. Iain Glen (Jack Taylor; Downton Abbey); Elsa Mollien (Jane Eyre); Danny Webb (Land Girls); Ruth Sheen (Bramwell, Berkeley Square).

=2= The Big Four ==Big ""quatre""? Countries? Or Poirot's big-4: Capt Hastings (Hugh Fraser); Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran -her last appearance of 32 episodes); Japp (Philip Jackson -his last appearance of 40); Butler George (David Yelland -who will appear again in final ep#5); who all appear together again. Pre-WW2 Poirot seeks help uncovering those responsible violent murders. Patricia Hodge (Rumpole of the Bailey; Shell Seekers); Michael Culkin (Garrows Law); Joe Farthing (Blandings).

=3= Dead Man's Folly ==Ariadne Oliver returns to create a murder mystery for a fete in Devon. She calls Poirot for assistance, fearing the worst, rightly so. So complex only Poirot can solve, non? Filmed at the Christie home estate. Sinead Cusack (North and South); Rebecca Front (Insp Lewis); Emma Hamilton (Tudors); Daniel Weyman (Foyle's War).

=4= The Labours of Hercules ==The scenic Alps, jewels, and van Druys art theft collide with mystery galore. Rupert Evans (Casualty); Nigel Lindsay (Clatterford); Sandy McDade (Larkrise to Candleford).

=5=Curtain: Poirot's Last Case ==Poirot, handicapped, is again at Styles with Hastings (last appearance of 43 eps) where they solved their first murder. Poirot believes another is eminent. And Agatha Christie leaves her fans debating the writer's decision for decades to come.  Helen Baxendale (Cold Feet); Philip Glenister (Life on Mars); Anne Reid (Last Tango in Halifax); Aidan McArdle (Mr Selfridge; Garrows Law); Matthew McNulty (The Paradise); Anna Madeley (Mr Selfridge).
Sadly, over 60 years after it was originally written, the end has come. Le temps passe!

6122923,5,B00GWXI1AK,"A lovely 19-minute interview with David Suchet is the main Bonus Extra on the Series 13 DVD/BluRay sets. It was recorded in the gardens of Greenway Estate, Agatha Christie's home, during the filming of episode 3, ""Dead Man's Folly"". I could listen to Suchet's deep melodious voice all day. It is quite different from Poirot's higher-pitched and mincing speech pattern. David elaborates on this: ""I studied his English. I developed my accent, because everybody thinks he's French. So he can't sound pure Belgian, it's too guttural. Everybody would know he's not French."".

Not just mincing speech, but mincing walk. Suchet says when he first took on the role, in 1989, ""I made a big dossier, a big big file. Every book I read [of Agatha Christie's Poirot mysteries], I made notes. Every characteristic that she wrote about him.""

That includes the mustache, of which Poirot is inordinately proud. Suchet says, ""The mustache has changed over the years. But, fortunately, Agatha Christie has about thirty different descriptions of Poirot's mustache, so I don't feel guilty about that!""

Series 13 originally aired in the UK in June - November, 2013. It has 5 episodes with an average length of 92 minutes, for a total 462 minutes of exceptional viewing.  Two Bonus Extras are on the last disc of the boxed sets. The shows are presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo audio. English subtitles are available for all episodes. My favorite episode is ""The Labour of Hercules"" - it starts off with the fussy and worried Porot having to take a funicular up a Swiss mountain to a hotel covered in snow.

Episode 1.  ""Elephants Can Remember"".  It's 1925, a man and woman are strolling along the path high above the white cliffs of Dover. Two shots ring out, and they're both dead.
Skip to 13 years later, and Ariadne Oliver is accosted by a Mrs. Burton-Cox at a dinner. The latter's son, Desmond, is engaged to Celia Ravenscroft, Ariadne's godchild. Burton-Cox wants Ariadne to ask Celia, ""Did her father kill her mother, or did the mother kill the father?"" Ah, the couple on the cliff were Celia's parents. What a dreadful thing to ask! But, as it happens, neither Celia nor Ariadne really understand what happened that day.
So Ariadne goes to her old friend, Poirot, to ask for help. But he doesn't have time to resurrect her old murder because he has a new murder to investigate. The respected Doctor Willoughby has been found drowned in an abandoned hydrotherapy tub.
Wouldn't it be strange if the two murders were related?
I enjoyed this episode's humorous moments. Such as when Poirot tells Oliver she has to find the facts of the old murder herself. Go back to Eastbourne, he tells her, and ask around, find people who remember. Oliver: ""You mean elephants. Sorry, I was thinking of elephants at that dinner last night.""
Poirot: ""With hesitation, I ask why.""
Oliver: ""Because the meringue got stuck in my teeth.""
Poirot: ""I see."", when he obviously doesn't.
Oliver: ""Meringue. Dentures. Ivory - elephants.... Must find the elephants.""
Trivia: The novel this is based on is the last novel which Christie wrote (not the last published). It has inconsistencies which bother critics. The novel did not have a current murder to be solved, only the old murder. Adding a current murder in the TV show does a lot to spice up the screenplay and results in a different story arc.
If you love classic British mysteries, you may recognize Caroline Blakiston, who plays Oliver's old friend, Julia Carstairs. Blakiston played Bess Sedgwick in ""At Bertram's Hotel"", one of my very favorite Joan Hickson/Miss Marple episodes.
Episode 2.  ""The Big Four"". On the Pampa plains of Argentina, Captain Hastings receives an envelope edged in black. So does the retired Miss Lemon (her hair dyed an improbable red). They were sent by Inspector Japp, now Assistant Commissioner. The envelopes hold an invitation to the memorial service for Hercule Poirot.
Let's go back to four weeks before Poirot was killed by a bomb. The newspapers were full of warnings about a criminal cabal: ""Where Will The Big Four Strike Next?"" It almost drives the news about Germany and Italy flexing their fascist muscles off the newspapers' front pages. In London, the international Peace Party holds a soire to illustrate how countries can co-operate. Poirot and Japp are there - and witness first hand an ingenious murder. Which is just the beginning of this episode's mysteries.
Trivia: The screenplay is very different from the novel of the same name, Christie's 7th, published in 1927. But changing the screenplay did not save it from turning into melodrama. There is a funny point though, when the killer chides Poirot. Poirot had made fun of him for being dramatic, then Poirot himself uses high drama to host his denouement for a captive audience.
Episode 3.  ""Dead Man's Folly"". Poirot receives a telegram: ""Come at once. Nasse House Devon. Need help urgent. Ariadne Oliver"". Poirot drops everything and rushes to Nasse, where he finds nothing wrong with Oliver. But she's worried. The people at Nasse House are very strange, and ""I think someone's going to die."" ""I've been here 3 days, and every time someone says something, I get the strongest impression they're lying."" She's right and she's very right.
Trivia: Ze Wanamaker has portrayed Ariadne Oliver in 6 Poirot TV episodes with David Suchet.
Episode 4.  ""The Labours of Hercules"".  The elite of London are lined up to be announced at a big do, hosted by the young and beautiful Lady Lucinda, dripping in diamonds. The police are present en force, disguised as servers and attendants. And Poirot is there, though he chides the Chief: ""Against the advice of Poirot, you have arranged this whole operation.... There is the greatest of danger.""
It's supposed to be a trap. The master thief, Marrascaud, is sure to show up and attempt to steal Lucinda's jewels, as well as her valuable van Druys painting, ""Vanquishing the Hydra"". Marrascaud has stolen the other 11 paintings in van Druys' Labours of Hercules series, and will want this last one. Poirot's concern stems from Marrascaud's modus operandi - violent and bloody, killing for the pleasure of it -  and they are using the trusting Lucinda as bait.
The night does not end well, and Poirot is plunged into unhealthy brooding by his guilt at failing Lucinda. Three months later, his doctor tells him he needs a new case to bring him out of his depression. And one seems to fall into his lap. It takes him to the Clinique Alpine at the Hotel Olympos, Switzerland. Nobody at the clinic is as they seem, not even the White Knight practically begging to be taken advantage of.
This is a wonderful episode, convoluted, keeps you on your toes and guessing. There are several humorous moments, such as Poirot's reaction when the hotel host invites him to try the sauna and steam room. Or when an exasperated Dr. Lutz asks Poirot, ""Why do you insist on referring to yourself in the third person? It is intensely irritating!""
Trivia: The Countess Vera Rossakoff, played here by Orla Brady, could have been Poirot's great love. This is the 2nd time we've seen her in the Poirot TV series. Her first appearance was in ""The Double Clue"" (1991, Series 3), where she was played by Kika Markha.
Episode 5.  ""Curtain: Poirot's Last Case"". Captain Hastings arrives at Styles, a guest house run by Daisy and Toby Luttrell. He's been here before, as he tells Nurse Craven: ""In 1916. I came here to convalesce. That's when I met Poirot"".
Poirot, now confined to a wheel chair and suffering from heart trouble, has asked Hastings to visit him. Hastings: ""You're up to something, aren't you?""
Poirot, ""Oui.""
Hastings: ""I knew it! Otherwise, why come back to the scene of our first murder?""
Poirot: ""Because, mon ami, I fear it will soon be the scene of another.""
There's just one hitch. Poirot doesn't know who the victim will be and he doesn't know who the murderer will be.
In any case, there will be a terrible choice to make.
Trivia: The first meeting of Hastings and Poirot was in ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"", Agatha Christie's first published novel, 1916. Suchet filmed that story in Series 3, 1991.

DVD/BluRay Bonus Features:
....A.  ""Interview With David Suchet"" (19 minutes)
....B.  Photo Gallery (2 minutes) Rehearsal stills.

Farewell, Poirot! It's a good thing I have all my DVD's, to partially comfort me as I ponder the prospect of no new episodes with the amazing David Suchet.
Did you know that David Suchet wrote a memoir of his years playing Poirot? Is is a nice easy read and recommended:

6122924,5,B00GWXI1AK,"ITV productions have outdone themselves!  I miss the original theme music but, a small price to pay for this final spectacular series!  I paid almost double the price for the Blu-ray through an early release through Acorn and am so glad I did - I couldn't wait until November!  The camera shots, the close-ups of Hercules' thinking process brought to life - extremely well done and, although I am a devout fan of the previous Poirot series' collections, this is without a doubt the best filmed work of its predecessors.  Can't be missed, especially ""The Labours of Hercule.""  Brilliant!  It's also amazing that he appears to be aging much better than his colleagues (Hastings, Miss Lemon and Japp) - he is timeless perfection.  Congratulations, Mr. Suchet; you are and always will be a marvel.",1410566400,,793,4.873134328358209
6122925,5,B00GWXI1AK,"These episodes are currently being shown on Acorn TV (a paid streaming service, very reasonable), and thus far, the quality is superb.  I especially enjoyed ""Labours of Hercules.""  This set will not disappoint avid enthusiast of Poirot.  Will definitely purchase to complete my collection (whenever it's released on DVD)!",1408838400,2,321,5.510204081632653
6122926,5,B00GWXI1AK,"Agatha Christie wrote Dead Man's Folly in 1956. In Christie's story the setting for the manor house, Nasse House, was  originally owned by the Folliat family and located on the river Helm. It was based on one of Christie's favorite real world manor houses and sites which she later purchased, Greenway, having a superb Georgian Design dating from 1780-1790.  Greenway is situated on a large secluded tract of land with an abundance of trees and gardens loaded with Rhododendrons overlooking the river Dart in the beautiful Devonshire country side. (Sander's & Lovallo: The Agatha Christie Companion) It is truly a place of serenity, peace and quiet, but in Dead Mans Folly it will soon be infused with deceit, fraud and murder.

The story has endless twists, turns and climaxes. The characters are all very interesting, well developed and very well played. Poirot, Agatha Christie's brilliant Belgian sleuth, played by David Suchet, is called in to help his good friend Ariadne Oliver, an authoress of detective stories, who has just devised a new game, a Murder Hunt, to enliven a Fete (Fair) to be held at Nasse House the next day. When the pretend subject of a murder for the Murder Hunt winds up being really murdered the Police are called in. David Suchet does an admiral job as Poirot. His style has returned to earlier times and he again plays the Poirot we all loved so much. It is a great story and its presentation is superb. So order the set of five new DVDs, Series 13, NOW. It includes: The Big Four, Dead Man's Folly, Elephants Can Remember, Labors of Hercules and Curtain to complete the set of Christie's 70 stories featuring Poirot. I understand they will be released in mid  September.

And while you are ordering, unless you already have them, also order the set of three DVDs with Peter Ustinov playing Poirot in Dead Man's Folly, Thirteen at Dinner and Murder in Three Acts. They are all filmed with the magic human element that only Peter Ustinov can instill. In my opinion the version of Dead Man's Folly staring Peter Ustinov is  clearer, more understandable and more enjoyable than the version staring David Suchet; but you should definitely have both versions so you can make your own comparison. It is too bad that Peter Ustinov did not make more of the Poirot shows; he would have been terrific in Murder on the Orient Express.",1407715200,5,2355,4.773955773955774
6122927,4,B00GWXI1AK,"I stumbled across a viewing of ""The Four"" that was being shown on a local PBS channel last night. Apparently PBS is running all the shows in this series. If you're interested in previewing the shows before buying you might want to check your local PBS station schedules. As far as the show itself goes, I won't reveal any spoilers, but just say it was typical Poirot and fun to see all the actors reunited after so many years.",1406764800,3,426,4.405063291139241

I have had a chance to see them all and I will tell you, as a fan of Poirot since the first episode aired many years ago, that this is one of the very best series of all.  Poirot fans should be delighted, albeit a bit sad to see this wonderful series come to an end.  One bright spot is to see Poirot reunited with his old friends Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Inspector (now Assistant Commissioner) Japp in one story, while Hastings returns and plays a key role in ""Curtain,"" the final episode.",1405641600,7,659,4.341463414634147
6122930,5,B00GWXI1AK,"Poirot with David Suchet is a tremendous series and I love it. I've purchased every release so far.  My discussion here is for the Region 2 DVD set of the final five Poirot movies in the series. I am posting it on the USA Amazon.com site for benefit of US viewers who are upset over the late date release of the Region 1 (R1) DVD set.  In this day and age, many DVD players and computers can play PAL formatted DVDs from Europe. You need to ensure that your DVD equipment can play PAL format and also does not have a region code restriction turned on.  Even if your player handles PAL format, a region code restriction may prevent your discs from playing.  However, the region code setting can be turned off in many models (not all).  You can usually determine if the region setting can be turned off (made Region Free) by searching your DVD player product options with the manufacturer.  That can be done online in most cases.  You can also ask a technician in some electronics stores as well and they can check on that for you.  I live in the USA and could not wait to see these final movies in the series, so I ordered the Region 2 (R2) set from Amazon.co.uk in June.  The set arrived in just under two weeks (quite fast) and I paid approximately $25 in US funds after conversion of the British pounds pricing for the R2 set.  It is a wonderful series and the R2 set has all five of the final films complete and uncut in 16:9 anamorphic display with optional subtitles.  Also included are two bonus features with David Suchet discussing the Poirot series and how he decided on his manner of portraying Poirot as an actor.  My JVC model DVD player is dual format (PAL and NTSC) and also region free, so I can enjoy DVD media from virtually anywhere in the world. For those of you who have a DVD player or other equipment that can play or stream R2 PAL formatted material to your HDTV I would strongly recommend that you consider the R2 DVD set as an alternative.  It is much cheaper than the proposed price for the R1 set scheduled for November.  This is just a possible option for some of you who cannot wait for the R1 release.",1404864000,15,2131,4.335012594458438

I've watched some of the trailers of Curtain and it seems it's been played on PBS over 1 or 2 years now and in other countries as well...so what's the hold up to this?

6122940,5,B00GWXI1AK,"I watched the last episodes with an occasional tear in my eye - especially those episodes that brought together the original characters: Poirot, Miss Lemon, Hastings & Inspector Japp. Each story was well-adapted for TV, the acting as usual, was superb and the sets and production value high. The last episode ""Curtains""  was a bit sad, but then so is life as we near our end. HOWEVER, my 17 year old granddaughter loved each episode including ""Curtains"" and predicts that another series will be produced, hopefully by the Brits who do it best, and a new Poirot will arise. She is of course correct. Great stories and unforgettable characters never die, they are just resurrected time after time.

I highly recommend the series to all Poirot fans. ""Newbys"" should start with the very first episodes and watch the progression or evolution in Poirot's character and in the way Agatha Christie's books have been adapted to reflect current social mores and conventions. I found the transition in the later episodes a bit disconcerting at first, but watching the newer episodes including  ""Appointment with Death"" and ""Cat Among the Pigeon"" left me more than satisfied. The thematic music in the newer episodes was superb and added to my enjoyment of watching these programs. My 90 year old dad also loves all of the episodes.
When you can satisfy viewers spanning ages 17 years to 60-something to 90 years old, you know that Christie's writing was very special and the series producers have done something very right.

 As an aside, I've started watching the new Father Brown episodes and they are GOOD. There is some comedic moments, but the story lines are interesting, have excellent production value and a cast of British actors that can't be beat. I recommend Father Brown to any Brit-loving, mystery savoring fans of BBC productions.",1393977600,103,1834,4.960912052117264
6122941,5,B00GWXI1AK,"My hat is off to David Suchet for being THE Hercule Poirot. I am so glad the series of books and short stories were completed. I did not even wait for it to air in the U.S., but ordered the British DVD on Amazon.co.uk and watched it on my computer hooked up to my TV. Of the five movies, I enjoyed Elephants Can Remember the best. The casting was excellent, and the characters were well developed, and the plot line was outstanding. Dead Man's Folly was faithful to the book. The Big Four and especially the Labours of Hercules took great liberties with the books, but that was probably inevitable. Although the ending of the Big Four was not very strong, I thought the writers did an excellent job crafting the Labours of Hercules into one movie. Finally, Curtain is faithful to the book, although I thought Poirot's attitude towards Hastings was too critical and mean-spirited. Finally, the Being Poirot documentary was outstanding, and a great summary of the series and the talented work of David Suchet. Do not wait for PBS to air it in the U.S., but buy the DVD collection now and watch it on your computer.",1392508800,21,1112,4.565

I have seen all of these movies now, and although a couple of them are not as good as I'd hoped, I still enjoyed watching them.  I have them now to enjoy watching again from time to time, especially when I have the inclination to do so.  I have no regrets in buying the last of this series.  My only disappoint is that there is no more of Agatha Christie's books that have been made into movies (like ""Sparkling Cyanide"").
