3614343,2,B001GLLMY0,"It was OK not what I was expecting. I thought it had to do mostly with Ghost Adventures, it was a bunch of different ghost hunters and their experiences.",1358035200,,153,4.310344827586207
3614344,4,B001GLLMY0,"I really enjoyed this set, some of the stories are pooly filmed but still attention holding. If you like Ghost stories I highly recommend this set.",1355184000,,147,4.6923076923076925
3614345,5,B001GLLMY0,"I love this DVD!!! I like that there are different stories for you to choose from. My favorite story is from the Queen Mary and the story about the little ghost girl Jackie!!!! My favorite host of the queen Mary tour is Peter James. The queen Mary was also shown on the paranormal show ""sightings"". I enjoyed the other stories on this DVD like the evps!!!! Great DVD!!! I am glad I purchased this DVD!!!!",1344124800,,404,4.4
3614346,1,B001GLLMY0,"Firstly, let me say I love anything paranormal...I have found this subject to be fascinating to the extreme.  I have first hand knowledge of several paranormal sightings and experiences.  Have been most interested in tv shows like ""Most Haunted"" from the U.K. and Ghost Adventures from the USA.
When I saw this collection, I jumped at the chance to see something a bit different, and the price was good too.
It was the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to actually pay money for...sub-standard quality and dull specials.",1343692800,3,529,4.866666666666666
3614347,2,B001GLLMY0,"This Paranormal Activity- TVland style collection is good if you get it at a cheap price ($5 or less).  For the most part, the set contains the documentary pilot for the then unknown Ghost Adventures crew, a four part mini-series produced by some college kids called Ghost Stories, the pilot (and only) episode of the late psychic Peter James' Ghost Encounters (he died shortly after completing the pilot thus making this episode it's swan song), and finally a rather poor attempt at a horror movie sloppily called Ghosts Don't Exist.

Understandably, the Ghost Adventures documentary is the best of the lot. It's pretty cool to see just how cheap Zak, Nick, and that other guy were before their pseudo-fame hit them. The history of the various locales they visit are really carefully thought out and helps add an air of creepiness when they do their lockdowns. While their evidence of paranormal activity is suspect at best, the show does keep your attention focused and does produce some well placed chills especially if you happen to be watching it in the middle of the night in a darken room.

Unfortunately, the same can not be said for the rest of the set.

Ghost Stories is obviously a low budget affair. The lighting and audio are poor and the editing is abysmal. One moment, the crew will be on location mumbling (I doubt this was intentional on their part) about the local boogeyman haunting that particular area and suddenly we are in a whole other city dealing with a whole other haunting without so much as clarifying the last case. And the witnesses tend to repeat themselves. At the start of one story, a man says ""I feel my house is haunted."" and not five minutes later, we hear the same man say ""I feel my house is haunted."".  Um, yeah dude, I kinda got that the first time you said it.  Also, the four hour-long episodes feel nearly three hours long each because they are so dry and boring. It's little wonder why this series was only available On Demand for so long and now available through the notoriously cheap Echo Bridge DVD line since I doubt that this series would garner such a high demand like A Haunting has.

Peter James chooses to board the overdone investigation of the Queen Mary for the maiden voyage of his proposed series and uncovers nothing no other paranormal investigator or tourist hasn't already made public.  For a better examination of this famous ghost ship, watch the Unsolved Mysteries segment in their Ghosts DVD collection.

As for the actual movie Ghosts Don't Exist, I have yet to attempt to watch it and, at this point, I don't know if I will any time soon.  From what I've read in other reviews, I'm not really missing much.

So, there you have it. The set is ok for a rainy afternoon but I would try and not spend over the stated $5. For fans of Ghost Adventures, I would recommend it simply for the fact that you're paying for the original documentary and you're getting about 5 hours worth of bonus features. For the casual viewer, you might be risking your $5.",1342569600,12,3017,4.610074626865671
3614348,5,B001GLLMY0,"I thought this was going to be cheesy like some of the other off the wall paranormal DVD's I have bought, but this is one good little collection of ghost investigation creepiness.  Here is what this DVD offers:

1.  Ghost Adventures first documentary ever of the amazing footage they captured in Virginia City, Nevada of a flying brick in the basement of Goldfield Hotel.  I already have a DVD of this documentary, but it is excellent and I am very happy to have another copy.  It is the first documentation of Zak, Nick and Aaron, now famous in the paranormal community, as they investigated their first and possibly best haunted location.  They have since returned to Virginia City several times, still intrigued by the history and the spirts that dwell there.

2.  An independent movie called ""Ghosts Don't Exit"".  I also bought this on DVD previously, but it's a decent film about ghost investigators spending the night in a man's home - a man who shot himself in front of them in the living room when they arrived.  The man claimed to have seen the lead investigator's dead wife's spirit in his house.  It has its moments.

3.  Ghost Encounters.  The documentary of what was supposed to be a series featuring my favorite psychic ever, Peter James.  Sadly, Peter died shortly after the documentary was finished, so this one has a special place in my heart for me.  And it has some amazing auditory evidence aboard the Queen Mary of several of the many hundreds of spirits that haunt this vessel.  The encounter with the child spirit, Jackie, was amazing and bittersweet.  I wish Peter had lived to finish this series, but at least we have the documentary and many other paranormal programs that featured this wonderful, gifted man.

4.  Ghost stories - 4 episodes:

Conversations with the Dead - paranormal activity from Witches Castle, Benton County Jail, Fowler City Theater, and Drena's Bar and Grill.

Walking with the Dead - examines some of the most haunted places in the state of Indiana.

Unmasking the Dead - Michael Jones, the inspiration for the movie The Sixth Sense, shares his insight on experiencing the paranormal.  I have seen Michael on old shows of Unsolved Mysteries and the like, but he was young and very uncomfortable with his psychic gift.  In Unmasking the Dead, he is a grown man and more willing to talk about 'seeing dead people'.  Very good episode.

Following the Dead - One of the stories here includes the legendary H.H. Holmes, doctor turned serial killer, and the house where he killed one of his wards.  Very interesting episode and a rather grisly photo of the good doctor himself.

I am very pleased with this collection.  I had not seen Ghost Stories before nor the documentary featuring Peter James, both pleasant surprises.  I highly recommend this DVD if you have never seen these episodes, or even if you have but would like a mixture of some of the best made documentaries and ghost hunting episodes out there.  I know I will be watching these again and again.",1338076800,38,3007,4.745173745173745

3614395,2,B001GLLMY0,"I will say up front that I couldn't bring myself to finish watching this collection.  That being said, what I did watch was boring because the ""Ghost Hunters"" seemed amateur and ill-trained.  I know a lot of people liked this but there are much better collections available that explain how and why the scientific methods are used, and show actual paranormal investigators with years of experience.  They also show the difference between a ghost haunting and a demon attachment or possession.  Sorry, this was just not for me even after I watched something from each disc.",1397606400,2,572,4.927083333333333
3614396,5,B001GLLMY0,I was looking for the Ghost Adventures Documentary that started it all before the Travel Channel series and I came across this.  Not only do you get the Documentary you get hours and hours of additional ghost stories.

3614413,3,B001GLLMY0,"Item is packaged well. The Ghost Adventures Documentary alone makes it worth while.  The investigation of the Queen Mary is good too..the others are kind of older and are not great quality.  One gives a great example of ""investigating"" (investigating incorrectly!!). Editing is horrible.  Had some of these been edited better they'd be half the time and a lot more interesting. They almost try to edit the mystery and horror into it rater than let the evidence speak for itself.

For the Queen Mary and Ghost Adv. alone it's worth the 5 bucks!",1364774400,3,543,4.806451612903226
3614414,5,B001GLLMY0,"The title initially threw me, kinda thought I pulled up 'Ghost Hunters' (another paranormal show, not bad, but they need Grant back) by mistake. I absolutely love this dvd. It has 7 different episodes- some I have never seen. They do have a dvd out called 'Ghost Adventures The Original Documentary' (bonus movie inside). Both of those are in this dvd. I made the mistake of not reading all the episodes too closely and bought both (due to opening the documentary one first, I can't return it...). This is better cause it has 5 more investigations in it. Get your blanket and popcorn ready, turn out the lights and enjoy!!!! oh yeah, pleasant dreams.",1364342400,21,650,4.7105263157894735

3614417,3,B001GLLMY0,I thought this would be similar to Ghost adventures or ghost hunters but I was disappointed. It was okay but I would dig a little more about each episode.,1359763200,,154,4.344827586206897
3614418,4,B001GLLMY0,"I am a HUGE fan of Ghost adventures, after having watched every other ghost hunting show on television, I finally ran across this one.
