766529,5,6304052898,"Though the idea of mankind's destiny being manipulated by aliens has been used several times in the series' history, this is still a first-rate and highly entertaining story.  What really sets it apart are the interesting ideas - the last survivor from the 'fifth planet' which once existed between Mars and Jupiter, the creepy settings and the top-notch final episode.  The transformation scenes in a giant pentagram, accompanied by haunting music, really do stick in the mind.  The story's monsters, the Fendahleen (a cross between a hooded cobra and a giant slug) look suitably dramatic and well-designed, and Tom Baker, whether he is being witty, brooding, clever or wild, gives a good performance.  The rest of the cast are also strong characters, and the bonus is a complete absense of that stupid childish metal dog.",1056844800,,823,5.074074074074074
766530,3,6304052898,"Dr. Who and Leela are pulled to earth by a time disruption to discover that a group of scientists are trying to sonically scan time to discover the origin of a 12 million year old human skull.
Only the skull isn't human but alien from the solar system's fifth planet, now destroyed because os the Fendahl, a creature that lives on bio-energy, leaving death and desolation behind it.
The local witch becomes involved because a coven, led by a scientist, tries to raise the Fendahl as a means of securing personal power. The witch helps the Dr. through her ""old ways"", ultimately killing the fendahl and saving earth.
This is not one of the Dr.'s best. The action is spotty and the plot, while interesting (the idea that the skull influenced human evolution to provide a future host), leaves too many unanswered questions (not necessarily a bad thing but in this case, it is). The time lords destroyed the fifth planet and sealed it in a time vortex, presumably to protect the universe from the Fendahl. Dr. Who is always making last minute rescues but, since he's a time lord, why doesn't he simply go back to the beginning, and save everyone from the whole mistake?
Anyway, I'm quibbling. It's a good one but not his best, but still better than the rest.",1019433600,3,1254,4.62780269058296

766532,5,6304052898,"This has to be one of my all time favourite Doctor Who stories. From the very first time I saw it (well over 18 years ago) I was gripped. It is very  watchable and seething with atmosphere. Although part of Graham Williams's  first season as the show's producer, in which he had the task of making  Doctor Who a lighter, more humorous show, this is definitely a product of  the Philip Hinchcliffe era. It is one of the closest stories to be able to  be classed as horror. From the special sounds and incidental music, to the  early scenes of the hiker being stalked through the woods, ""Image of  the Fendahl"" keeps you on the edge of your seat. The scenes of the  skull glowing in the dark are also truly terrifying moments, as are the fog  shrouded acts in the Priory grounds. Chris Boucher, who had already written  two of the best Doctor Who scripts in the Tom Baker era, delivers again  with the plot. The concept of the Fendahl playing such an influential role  in the development of humankind is certainly not new to science fiction,  nor indeed Doctor Who itself - ""The Daemons"" is the obvious  comparison, but in my opinion ""Image of the Fendahl"" is ten times  better than the Jon Pertwee tale. Even the quieter moments, for example  when Fendleman and Colby examine the skull in the laboratory and  hypothesise its history, are fascinating and unsettling. Performance wise,  most of the cast are pretty good, except New Zealand born actor Dennis Lill  could have avoided the Germanic ""eccentric scientist"" accent of  Dr Fendleman - it is trite to the point of cliche. But this is the only  real qualm I have. Scott Fredericks is excellent as the megalomaniac Stael,  as is Edward Arthur as Colby, the innocent bystander, with whom the  audience is probably meant to sympathise with the most. Daphne Heard's  Martha Tyler is also first rate. Oh yes, the monsters...Ahem...well, the  Fendahleen may not be the most convincing monsters - but it's Doctor Who, a  cheaply made BBC programme - so what else is new? However, the fact that  they are hidden from view most of the time, and only revealed in their  adult form at the end of episode three, is also a major contribution to the  atmosphere. And, as usual, Tom Baker and Louise Jameson are wonderful as  the Doctor and Leela. In fact, the entire story is wonderful. Watch it,  enjoy it, and look forward to the terror!",965088000,16,2379,4.619617224880383
766533,3,6304052898,"I got this video. I don't regret it. Something rather marvellous about ""vegging out"" in front of the video with some toasted crumpets....
""Image of the Fendahl"" possibly belongs to the  loosely defined category of stories which might be classed as somewhat  close to the margins. It doesn't matter. It is wonderful to watch Dr  Fendahlman only just manage not to laugh, and with some of the lines, I'm  not surprised. My kids like this story precisely and specifically because  of this.
One slight difficulty is that with this story, we have yet  another explantion of how life started on earth. The ones prior to this  that I can actually recall are
1. The Daemons did it as an experiment  (which had failed)
2. A Jagaroth spaceship blew itself up and started the  whole thing with massive radiation.
This time, The Fendhal, a wholly  parasitical lifeform, feeding on the full spectrum of life energy,  ""guides"" the evolution of life of earth. And also, while  ""it"" is at it, persuades some humans to adopt the name  Fendahl....
Oh brother....
This movie is pretty good on the  aarrgghhh!  rating front. Fendahlman has a marvellous line with his close  to last words, delivered in fine style..
""I have been used! WE have  used! MAN-KIND-HAS-BEEN-USED!"" which honestly, I would give a great  deal to say on camera. Must be great to tell your grand childre you did  that!
Tom is even more detatched, bizzarre, and compassionate. He works  well with both villians and (weird) heroes, reviving a lady in a trance  state with tea and fruit cake. That was rather a good scene, equalled only  where he offers the Fendahl skull a jelly baby...
The villians are headed  up a rather good actor who decides to... take over the world.... using the  Fendahl. Ah! But he doesn't and is destroyed!
This is completely stupid,  you know. I'm nearly 40, and I still go ape over this... I should be  watching Tenessee Williams by now and growing up. This is very embarassing,  but I've got four kids so that's my excuse.",954460800,6,2002,4.710982658959537

766699,2,6304052898,"Image of the Fendahl is a typical Doctor Who story that really doesn't stand out. It's better produced than its predecessor, the Invisible Enemy but not near as much fun. As horror, it certainly doesn't work as well as the Hinchcliffe stories from previous seasons or the Season opener. It features Leela with a hairdo that's totally out of character and a change of outfit that goes from plausible jungle warrior princess to an outfit that's revealing for its own sake. Overall, a few spooky moments but not all that impressive.",1417996800,,529,4.824175824175824

766701,5,6304052898,"Image of The Fendahl has something of a special  meaning for me, as the last episode was set on the day I was born. That aside, it is an enjoyable serial with a nice plot. The Fendahleen may look a bit silly, but I like it that way. It's part of the classic Doctor Who charm. They're actually not that bad a design idea, the crew just didn't have the time and budget to fully realize them. Wanda Ventham does an excellent job as both Thea Ransome and The Fendahl Core, and I felt sympathy for both characters. I'm not really a fan of Leela, but I actually like the way she is portrayed as opposed to some of her other stories. The glowing skull is a great effect, and Tom Baker is wonderful. Edward Arthur is great as the sarcastic, skeptical scientist Adam Colby. All of the actors give high-quality performances, though Dr. Fendelman's on/off fake German accent is a bit distracting. There are a few plot holes, such as where Colby's dog Leaky went after his minute or so of screen-time and a few other things I won't mention.

A warning, it is a fairly dark episode, and Stael's fate might trouble more sensitive people, but for those who enjoy a bit of old-fashioned, non-graphic horror it is a fine show.",1389139200,,1209,4.417040358744394
766789,5,6304052898,"I was not impressed with the first few minutes of this, but as soon as it cut to The Doctor & Leela it became good & stayed that way all the way through to the end.  The story was interesting, the monsters were pretty creepy and the atmosphere was quite tense.  The only silly moments came from some of the Doctor's lines, & they weren't actually silly, they were funny (""You know Leela I don't think these cows know anything about the time scanner."").

766790,5,6304052898,"""Image of the Fendahl"" is a criminally underrated story. The pace is deliberately slow, but it's never boring, making this story incredibly suspenseful. One thing I will mention, however, is that this isn't a story for younger viewers, and it's not a great place to start if you want to get into classic Doctor Who. The villain doesn't appear until the end, but the final 10 minutes are sheer perfection. The scenes of the skull glowing in the dark are really creepy, and the opening scene in the foggy priory grounds is really chilling. The performances are top notch, and the writing is both witty and dark at the same time. If you're a fan of Tom Baker stories, then you will love this story. I did!",1377993600,,702,4.535433070866142
766791,5,6304052898,"This was a great episode that showed the Doctor still has things to learn. The Fendahl was thought to be a legend on old Galifrey and the Doctor has to reconcile that even sometimes legends are based on reality. Not giving any spoilers but this has a great basis for the story brought from the Erich Van Daniken book Chariots of the Gods with references to Ancient Astronauts. Always a most fun topic to debate. The Doctor as always plus the human species out of the fire before we get burned. I will always give props to these stories with Tom Baker as he is at his best with numerous styles of tv entertainment. Horror, drama,comedy, and always a good moral lesson stuck in between.",1340668800,,684,4.48
766792,3,6304052898,"""Image of the Fendahl"" put a stake in the heart of the gothic horror tradition that had predominated Doctor Who for going on three seasons. Script editor Robert Holmes, who along with producer Philip Hinchcliffe had played such a crucial role in developing (and often rewriting) those classic stories, was passing the baton to a new script editor, Anthony Read. (The following story, ""The Sun Makers,"" was the last script-edited by Holmes to be broadcast but had already been shot.) The BBC wanted the show to shy away from on-screen violence, so for now viewers could expect some harmless political satire, a little Greek mythology and another Time Lords story before the zaniness of the ""Key to Time"" season got under way.

Exterior shooting for ""Image"" returned Doctor Who to Stargrove Manor, the Victorian gothic mansion owned by Mick Jagger where ""Pyramids of Mars"" had been filmed two years earlier. Once again, horror stalks the grounds and hallways of an old priory as a research team tries to make sense of a human skull fossil believed to be an impossible 12 million years old. Secret ""time scanner"" experiments by the team's possibly deranged leader, Dr. Fendelman, are causing the skull to glow and transform a woman scientist on the team into a golden goddess who is actually the core of a gestalt creature called the Fendahl.

What raises ""Image of the Fendahl"" above a silly Quatermass-style monster story is not the latex creatures and special effects but the characters that propel the script: the obsessive Dr. Fendelman (Denis Lill), his malevolent assistant Max (Scott Fredericks), the empathic Thea (Wanda Ventham), and the ever-skeptical Adam (Edward Arthur). Special mention must be made here of veteran character actress Daphne Heard as Martha Tyler, the superstitious cook who saves the day with her knowledge of ""the old ways."" (Heard would pass away six years later.)

The Special Features menu doesn't have a lot to offer: a 26-minute ""making of"" documentary, some deleted and extended scenes, a trailer, a photo gallery and Radio Times listings in PDF format--nothing out of the ordinary, but then again this was a perfectly ordinary entry in the Doctor Who series.",1312675200,2,2194,5.05524861878453

766794,4,6304052898,"This is a good story from the first season that Graham Williams produced. It still had echoes of the glory days of Hinchcliffe/Baker.

766797,5,6304052898,"Elaborately balanced between horrific and comedic, ""Image of the Fendahl"" comes in near the midpoint of Tom Baker's tenure as the Doctor, a justifiably classic phase of the series when those responsible for its making seem confident but not complacent that their efforts will entertain a wide segment of the BBC audience. That is, while a bit murkier and edgier than prior years, this is still ""Doctor Who"" as the quintessential family show--somehow working on several levels at once. On the simplest and most tangible level we have big slug-like monsters (and, this being the olden days before CGI, I think we should stop a moment and appreciate the inventive craftsmanship that endowed them with a mouthful of squirming writhing tentacles). On an equally thrilling if less visceral level, we have a finely-scripted tale of suspense and mystery. On yet more sophisticated levels yet, all of this is framed and informed by a complex and intriguingly speculative science fiction premise of astronomical scale spanning eons--which might feel overly remote if it didn't all come to a crisis within the familiar context of rural England in the 1970's. And yet all these levels cohere in harmony rather than jarring and grating with each other, which takes astounding storytelling skill if you think about it.

It seems natural to characterize this story as the last gasp of the so-called ""gothic"" tendency seen in the show in the mid-70's. Certainly this is apt in that for all intents and purposes ""Image of the Fendahl"" follows the plot logic of a good horror story (in some ways it rather reminds me of John Carpenter's 1987 film ""Prince of Darkness"", in fact). It also works the old reliable ""Doctor Who"" alchemy of reinterpreting standard horror motifs in a science fiction idiom: the pentagram is a ""neural relay"", the inability to move as something wicked approaches (a prototypical nightmare) is due to some sort of psychic force, a pinch of salt to ward of evil works because sodium chloride ""prevents control of localized disruption of osmotic pressures"" and so on. For all that, though, this story is somewhat atypical. In such beloved classics as ""Pyramids of Mars"" and ""the Brain of Morbius"" and such, the scientific technical interpretation straightforwardly replaces the supernatural one, utterly displacing and invalidating it--a well-intended nod anyway to the show's original mandate to encourage an interest in science (and history) among its younger viewers. Here things are not so simple, however. The premodern, pre-scientific, indeed pre-Christian manner of explaining these phenomena, especially as they are articulated by the local wise woman/""witch"" Martha Tyler, are portrayed not as backwards, ignorant, and wrong but merely as different, as an alternate frame of reference every bit as functional when the Fendahleen are slithering towards you down the hall. You know things are getting weird when the Doctor reels off three mutually-conflicting explanations for what's happening as if all three are equally valid and equally invalid. That's surely eccentric even by the Fourth Doctor's standards. But for those of us who suspect that a little epistemological doubt is healthy, it's also rather refreshing.

Multiple levels of significance and sophistication would mean little if not for the wonderfully varied cast of characters we have here though, all of them saved from the brink of stereotype and brought to life by impeccable acting of the first order as well as a superb script sensitive to the finer points of characterization. One actually cares what happens to them, and that's the ultimate sorcery that makes or breaks a tale.",1253404800,21,3662,5.205084745762712
766798,4,6304052898,"""Image of the Fendahl"" was the last of ""Doctor Who""'s 1970s Gothic horror fests.  Producer Phillip Hinchcliffe, who oversaw such classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Pyramids-of-Mars-Episode-82/dp/B0002F6BSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Pyramids of Mars (Episode 82)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Talons-of-Weng-Chiang-Episode-91/dp/B0000AGQ27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Talons of Weng-Chiang (Episode 91)</a>, had recently left the series; script-editor Robert Holmes (who authored the two above-mentioned stories) was on his way out.  New producer Graham Williams was about to lighten the tone dramatically, and the show's violence content was about to fall off.

As a swan song for a well-regarded chapter in ""Doctor Who""'s long history, ""Image of the Fendahl"" is a notable but somewhat frustrating story.  The plot is complex, involving three conflicting menaces in the English woods: A high-technology ""Time Scanner"" that threatens to destroy the galaxy; an ancient time rift that's turned the local village into a haven for black magic (or ""the Old Religion"")... and a 12 million year-old skull that's going to exploit both the Time Scanner and the time rift in order to resurrect Death personified, which will in turn destroy the Earth's population (as opposed to, say, the galaxy).  Of course it's never a great idea when the story's named villain poses less of a menace than the secondary plot device.

Story writer Chris Boucher (who previously wrote the futuristic Christie-esque&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Robots-of-Death-Episode-90/dp/B00005LMAB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Robots of Death (Episode 90)</a>) was effective at writing for small but distinctive casts. One mark of a good writer is when the characters have different levels of intelligence.  One example of this, as well as of the story's dry wit, is when archaeologist Adam Colby tries to define the term ""gestalt"" for local villager Jack Tyler.  None the wiser, all Tyler can do is gesture at the Doctor and say: ""He reads a lot"".

There's a lot going on story-wise, so the rest of the cast turn out to be sophisticated plot devices as well as individuals.  Dr. Fendelman, the inventor of the Time Scanner, turns out to have a mystical connection to the Fendahl skull, which awkwardly manifests in the character's final 30 seconds.  Thea Ransome is (for no apparent reason) turned by the skull into a golden-skinned evil goddess.  Local ""white witch"" Granny Tyler turns out to possess just the right amount of homespun wisdom that allows her to defeat the 12 million year-old menace with a few shakers of salt.

The text commentary for this disc is a rare failure for the DVD restoration team.  A story of ""Fendahl""'s complexity suggests the need for a text commentary that both explains a lot of the story's more rapid-fire expository dialogue and attempts to resolve some of the story's plot holes.  Instead, the commentary here is full of distracting minutiae, such as ""this scene was filmed on this date"" and ""this tertiary character appeared in minor roles in the following 11 TV shows 30 to 40 years ago"".  The commentary track features four cast members but no-one from the production booth; there are lots of reminscences about the BBC's Television Centre circa 1977.  The DVD release itself is one of the ""light"" releases, so the only noteworthy extras are a standard making-of feature, and some black-and-white film outtakes.

The best part of the extras is the highlighting of Tom Baker's own, often ad-libbed, contributions to the Doctor's on-screen presentation.  Baker was compulsively watchable even in a bad story, and his Doctor's eccentricities add just the right amount of whimsy to this otherwise scary story.",1252713600,6,3945,5.805892547660312

Keep in mind that I was only 6 years old at the time.  This particular story is a memorable one that I have also waited for on DVD because of the occult/alien storyline, Tom Baker's acting at his best, and a memorable supporting cast like Louise Jameson, Edward Arthur, and Wanda Ventham.  This was the period of the best writing, producing, and directing in the show's history (including the new series which has little to be desired in writing and storylines and relies on CGI effects for the show's impact).  The story was expertly filmed especially on the tight budget of the time.  Just watch one of the opening scenes where the hiker is killed on a foggy moonlit night by the Fendahl.  This scene looks excellent even now in comparison to modern standards.  I can remember making my mother sit close to me when I was little watching this scene and being scared to death.  In all honesty, children aren't exposed to this type of fear in television anymore due to the PC agenda which dominates entertainment.

766905,4,6304052898,"Of all the characters in this story, the only one I felt sympathy for was the doomed Thea Ransome (Wanda Ventham.)  An intelligent woman who is used by arcane powers to serve as the host for some malignant alien being.  She falls into trances, the first unseen, the second broken by her ""friend"" Adam Colby.  When Thea collapses in front of Adam and the Doctor and is bathed in a halo with a bizarre vision of embryonic aliens, the Doctor recommends that her brain be X-rayed.  While he is dismissed as crazy by Fendleman and carried off, Adam dosen't say a bloody word.  HOW could he not report a spectacle so bizarre to his colleagues?  Dare anyone suggest it slipped his mind?  ""You must think my head zips up the back,"" he exclaims not long after.  Well Adam, if the shoe fits...
It's made abundantly clear that Thea is the focal point for the entire unfolding drama, but the other characters fail to notice that fact.  It's clearly not due to ignorance, it's likely due to stupidity (or bad writing.)  The Doctor bumbles about after breaking free and makes no attempt to track down Thea.  Fendleman and Adam rabbit on about mutation and pentagrams - in front of our hapless heroine - and not ONCE does Adam say to Fendleman:  ""Y'know I saw this shimmering halo around Thea and some freaky Lovecraftian beasties crawling around her!  Maybe we should stop the experiments!""  Rather, he blurts out the Doctor's recommendation about X-Rays without mentioning the extraordinary reason WHY.  Thea, perhaps tiring of her colleague's roundabout blather and lack of concern for her peculiar condition, ups and leaves.  It never occurs to Adam to keep an eye on his tormented friend.
Searching for the Hero of the Series in an attempt to save her comely ass, she instead falls into the clutches of the villain, Maxmillian Stael.  Drugged and bound, she is dragged into the basement of the manor by Max.  Soon after her two doofus colleagues are bound and dragged there as well.  Fendelman suddenly blurts out nonsense about him being used, Max being used and Adam being used.  No mention of the ultimate sacrifice lying supine before them.
An arcane ritual is conducted which transforms Thea into what looks like a radiant Hellenic Goddess (appropriate that her name means ""Goddess"" in Greek!)  Sadly, this devil in disguise has totally erased or submerged the hostess' personality.  She starts turning the participants in the ritual into the wormlike creatures that writhed over Thea's body... the Doctor manages to save idiot Adam and destroy the Fendahl Hostess and her worm flunkies by imploding them into Lovecraftsville.  The only eulogy for Thea is the look of distraught loneliness on her/the Hostess' face before she's slurped out of existence.  Adam mourns her loss by ""sticking on the kettle"" for a bunch rustic bumpkins who were peripheral to the story (and had WAY too much screen time.)  The Doctor and his sidekick Leela share some dumb bell wisecracks that would be appropriate for ANY other ""Doctor Who"" episode except this one.
""Image of the Fendahl,"" in more creative hands, would have been a cool occult episode complete with Thea as the Heroine-in-distress.  (Leela's no heroine, she's a comic relief.)  Sadly, the script writer ignored the strengths of the story and as a result, the episode imploded.
Before anyone drones out the catch-all excuse for a muddled teleplay, ""C'mon man, it's just a shooooo-oooooooow,"" do me a favor:  Stow it.  George Lucas uses that excuse for his bad prequels, the Trek franchise uses it for everything done after ""The Wrath of Khan,"" and it's getting old.",1084924800,7,3606,4.875205254515599
766906,4,6304052898,"The story starts out with the examination of a skull found in the volcanic sediment in Kenya.  Thea Ransome's potassium-argon test shows the volcanic sediment to be 12 million years old, but Dr. Adam Colby cannot accept the evolutionary implication of the skull:  ""What I don't accept is that Eustace here got himself buried under a volcano at least eight millions years before he could have possibly existed.""  The two and Maximilien Stael are colleagues of Dr. Fendelman, a scientific genius who made it big in electronics and who is using a sonic time scanner on the skull.  His discoveries could fundamentally affect how man views himelf.
Their experiments with the scanner plays havoc with the TARDIS, which is drawn to the grounds near Fetch Priory, where the team is based.  The Doctor and Leela not only become involved with the happenings there, including a mysterious death, but with Jack Tyler and his elderly grandmother, who has precognitive powers.  She and many of the villagers of Fetchborough believe in the old ways of superstition and magic.  Logic has no place in her life but more human nature.  ""When most people believe what's said, that make it true.""  Jack says ""Most people believed the earth was flat when it were round.""  She counters with, ""Ah, but they behaved as if it were flat,"" emphasizing the word ""behaved"".
What Dr. Fendelman is unwittingly tampering with involves a creature from the Doctor's own mythology that began when a planet between Mars and Jupiter exploded.  Unless the Doctor can stop them from messing with dangerous things, the population of Earth will go down from 4 billion people to 1 person.
There's a great deal of horror/suspense in this story, from the hiker walking in the forest at night, the eerie churning sound when the skull begins to glow, and the air of crisis described by Colby at one point.  ""The phone is cut off, the place is surrounded by guards, we are beset by a wandering lunatic, we have a pair of corpses on our hands, and on top of all that, the telephone seems to be very dead.  We are trapped.""
Tom Baker is at his usual goofiness.  He asks a bunch of cows upon landing, ""Which one of you has the time scanner?""  Another time, they are hiding outside the Priory and espy a guard and a dog.
Leela:  I shall kill him.
Doctor: No.
Leela:  Why not?
Doctor:  You'll upset the dog.
 He also offers a jellybaby to the skull and even goes ""Alas, poor skull"" a la Hamlet.  Here, Leela sports a lighter tan outfit that shows more cleavage and has her hair, of a more reddish tint, in a bun.  ""Don't worry, Doctor.  I shall protect you."" she says and does.
What really struck me about Wanda Ventham (Thea) was that rigid, stone-faced look of someone being possessed.  It's very reminiscent of Elizabeth Sladen's reaction on feeling her soul leaving her body in the Who story Planet Of Evil.  She has a stab at doing Dr. McCoy:  ""I'm a technician, not a human paleontologist.""  And this is one of Denis Lill's greatest TV moments as the misguided but persistent Fendelman, someone who is a passionate adventurer in unlocking mysteries of human evolution.  Daphne Heard is quite a character as the superstitious, headstrong, but also kind Ma Tyler.  The dialogue between her and her grandson show an argumentative but loving relationship.
Goofs:  The Doctor mentions two victims, naming one of them, even though he hasn't been told the name.  Another is a scene in Episode 2, when he is locked in a cupboard.  The sonic screwdriver doesn't work, yet later, the lock outside is heard unlocking and the door swings open.  Who let him out?
A mixture of science and the occult, this is the closest Dr. Who got to the horror genre.",1063411200,8,3692,4.693623639191291
766907,3,6304052898,"This is a rare below-average outing from Tom Baker's ""Golden Period"" as the doctor, which ran from his first appearance in ""Robot"" to his stand-alone turn in ""The Deadly Assassin""; a run which I believe covered about four seasons or so. ""Image"" is not actually a bad episode -- it has a creepy horror-movie atmosphere (especially at the beginning), a good sense of humor, and some strong performances by the guest actors and by Louise Jameson -- but it is hampered by plot holes, a not-too-terribly convincing monster, and a not-too-terribly credible ending. As with several of the weaker outings on this show, you get a sense watching it that it could have been a strong, solid episode if somebody had bothered writing a second (or third) draft. Plot holes are not necessarily fatal if everything else works in the story, but in this case, not everything else does.
The story has the Doctor investigating a ""rift"" in time which is eminating from that same rural English country mansion that seems to appear in about half the show's episodes. Turns out a team of scientists led by an obsessed millionaire genius are responsible; for reasons never adequately explained, they are scanning time following the discovery of a human skull which predates the appearance of humans on earth by about 11 1/2 million years. Of course, they are messing with something better left alone, and it turns out that the skull is actually the power source of a thought-to-be-extinct race of monsters called the Fendahl. The Fendahl are snake-like creatures who feed off death itself: the Time Lords destroyed them millions of years before because they represented a perversion of evolution. It turns out that one of the scientists is actually a member of a witch coven who believe the skull is their way to power, and between the (more or less) well-intentioned efforts of the scientists and the meddling of the witches, the Fendahl emerge from the endangered list to endanger our heroes and everybody else on the planet.
If the plot sounds a bit overdrawn, it is. The logical gaps are annoying, and the Fendahl don't work very well as villains, because in addition to looking like spray-painted foam flowers or badly rendered Chinatown dragons, there there isn't really a human villain in this episode for the Doctor to spar with, or even talk to. The female scientist turned into the Image of Fendahl doesn't have any dialogue, and spends most of the last episode striking somewhat silly poses and turning people into snakes. That skull is indeed creepy, but a glowing skull can't carry a whole episode. We are told it is indestructable (""The Fendahl is death. How do you kill death?"") and then at the end, the Doc breezily tosses it into a supernova to kill it. Why not spare yourself the contradiction and toss it into a black hole instead?
Okay, that last criticism is nerdly in the extreme. A cheap shot. On the plus side,  ""Fendahl"" does do a good job of combining horror with humor, it gives the enjoyable guest stars a lot of screen time, and is one of the episodes which plays up the combative-yet-affectionate relationship between the Doc and Leela with good effect. His largely unsuccessful attempts to civilize her are some of the finest moments in the series.
""Fendahl"" has problems which are hardly unique to this episode.
It's just in this case, those problems slightly outweigh the things that work. Not an episode I would recommend except to harder-core fans, but still worthy of a place in the collection.",1059523200,4,3504,4.84

7859902,4,6304052898,"Another great classic of the Tom Baker (Leela) era!
I don't care much for the Occult theme of this story but it isn't obsessively Satanic.
There are some great characters here which make for a sophisticated narrative. All are unique and very individual, especially the acerbic psychic grandmother who is a central character.
The story itself is a bit like the Dark Shadows soap opera and feels like an old Hammer horror film but intimate.
The two young male lead actors are handsome enough to be in a soap opera and they are well aware of it. It affects their performances which are a bit exaggerated.
The Fendahl creatures are fairly creative, they look like a cross between caterpillars and Triffids.
The Medusa like Fendahlin Golden Queen is very expressive but the painted snake eyes spoil the effect for me. I can't understand why prosthetic eyes weren't used, it would have been much more realistic. Fascinating character but we don't get to spend much time with her.
Cheap production values aside this is a worthwhile story and real fun but seems a little slow paced.
I find it a challenge to stay awake while watching but I do like it.

There are some good extras as usual and an Easter Egg.

This is not an absolute masterpiece but it is very good, as is tea and fruitcake.
