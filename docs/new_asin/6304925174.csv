7879507,5,6304925174,"If there is any movie out there that depicts a friendship that was rooted not just in lies but murder it's this film. My Very Best Friend is one of the best films out there in the movie industry today. Why would a woman gifted to have just about anything she ever wanted basically risk it all by lying deciving and even murder. Man, she is got to be one of the most evilest woman ever on film. What kind of a mind is it that drive some people to do a serious crime. In this film you get love lies and murder all over again just like the Clancy Brown film Love Lies and Murder. But this film is about a loving friendship that went deliberatly wrong because of one woman's obbession with lying and deciving everybody around here. Legendary actress the beautiful Jaclyn Smith of the hit TV Series Charlie's Angels stars as Dana Griffin and Jill Eikenberry also stars as in this movie as Dana's oldest friend Barbara Wilkins. What would you do if you found out that your very best friend turned out to be your very worst nightmare. Not because of you but because of the so-called best friend being your so called friend. I know what i would do? So if you are a fan of movies like this one here go buy it and see what i am talking about. Cool movie for the cool fan like myself that don't want to be lied and decived for nothing.",1303084800,,1324,4.196078431372549
7879508,4,6304925174,"This is a well-written, simple but disturbing film about friendship. The movie offers nothing new on the basis of the plot of most ""tv-movies"" of the week but acting wise, this is an excellent piece. Jaclyn Smith, is as always, beautiful and refined as the ""best friend."" One of the appeal of the film and sustains your interest in watching it, is seeing angelic Smith playing the villain. She's so sweet, so beautiful, but so bad..she's really bad! But she's actually good in playing bad. If there's any actress who should play the role of Gene Tierney in a re-make of the classic ""Leave Her To Heaven,"" Smith would be wonderful. For Jaclyn Smith fanatics, there's a nice first shots of her old Vogue cover shoots and some old photos. Go and rent it! You won't be sorry!",998697600,3,771,4.594202898550725
7879509,5,6304925174,This is one of Jaclyn Smith's best movies! She is such a great actress! I love Dana! It is one of my favirote movies! I reccomend that people all over the world buy it!,980640000,,168,3.9705882352941178
