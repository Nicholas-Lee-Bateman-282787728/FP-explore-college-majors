7886288,4,6305269092,"I consider Gerard Depardieu to be one of my favorite actors, and I will buy and watch/read anything he is a part of. I thought Bye Bye Monkey was interesting---even shocking in certain scenes! Taking into account the time period in which it was made, I would consider it to be avaunt-guard. It took me a while to absorb the message(s) and seeing it a second time helped me to understand & appreciate it better. Very unusual, frustrating, interesting, thought-provoking---those would be my words to describe the movie. And you can't beat Depardieu's charisma in everything he does!! In America he's an under-appreciated jewel, to be sure.",1376611200,,637,4.962616822429907
7886289,2,6305269092,"Marco Ferreri made some of the most peculiar, idiosyncratic, and controversial films of the twentieth century, and his first film in English, ""Bye Bye Monkey,"" definitely fits those three criteria. Ferreri's films are generally compelling if difficult exercises in surrealism and social commentary. This film is rife with symbolism and interpersonal conflicts, and serves as a commentary on the changing social mores of the 1970s, and particularly focuses on the changing perceptions of women in society. Apparently. Some of the symbolism and content is quite opaque, and there is plenty of room for interpretation. Another interpretation is that it's a film featuring long boring stretches of nothing and a monkey. (That just doesn't sound as good.)

Heading the cast are Grard Depardieu as Lafayette and Marcello Mastroianni as Luigi, two eccentric immigrants living in a New York City that is even more pretentious and rat-infested than in reality. Lafayette lives in an apartment that is apparently half service station bathroom and half rat farm judging from its ambiance, and works as a stagehand and production assistant for a very off-Broadway women's theater group. The seven actresses have a distaste for men in general and Lafayette in particular (though his boorish behavior rightfully earns their scorn,) which leads to my question: if they are all about feminism, why didn't they hire a female stagehand? After Lafayette unwittingly assists in the most distasteful actor's workshop ever, he and Luigi find King Kong's body lying next to the water in front of the World Trade Center towers (the film was made in 1977.) They discover a baby chimpanzee nuzzled up to Kong, and in one of Mastroianni's worst fits of overacting ever, Luigi explains that Lafayette should adopt the chimp because he has allergies to ape hair. (!) When consulted on the issue Andreas Flaxman (James Coco, who steals the show) advises Lafayette to ditch the monkey: ""You must get rid of this quadruped immediately....Forget the dictates of your heart!"" Thank goodness he doesn't take the advice, as the chimp is by far the most appealing cast member.

As the film progresses Lafayette gets into a weird relationship triangle (I dare not call it a ""love triangle"" here) with two women. This plot element is truly offbeat, and his decisions are definitely not where my own would have been. Not only does Lafayette not get rid of the monkey he takes it to a registrar and lists it as his child, named ""Cornelius Lafayette."" This attachment to his chimp is oddly noble, but ends up costing him dearly in the end. I suppose that's a commentary on the nature of love and the fragility of the mortal world, but you interpret for yourself.

Some of the plot defies simple description, and some of the techniques are painful to endure as a viewer. First there is the whistling. Lafayette uses a referee's whistle to scare the rats, his eternal foes, away. He becomes so fond of it he begins to use it to communicate instead of dialogue. This is a bit of a mixed blessing, but I found it profoundly annoying. Along the same grating lines, the film features intermittent musical numbers, the less said of which the better: my only comment is that after the singing you will probably be glad to hear the whistle again. The film also incorporates many other cultural artifacts, mostly through Flaxman's wax museum dedicated to Roman antiquity. I actually enjoyed Coco's part in the film more than any of the other (human) actors, as he is passionate and intense, while still being loon crazy. In a tribute to the big government conspiracy theories so popular after Watergate, Flaxman is visited by a psychological agent from the government who wants him to modernize the look of the wax statues for a more modern time. He demonstrates how Caesar should be made to look like JFK, while Nero is made to look like Nixon in a bit of symbolism that's hard to miss. (""You put Nixon's head on Nero's body!"") Nixon is also given a zither (it's not a fiddle anyway) of some sort to hold. This didn't surprise me, as Ferreri's Nixon predilection is seen in some of his other work as well. The film concludes in a genuinely dismaying manner, and careful observers might have seen it coming. In retrospect I should have, but didn't as by the time the ending rolled around I was a distinctly disinterested observer.

The DVD has a difficult menu to get to work correctly, and the disc didn't want to play on one of my DVD players at all. There is a bonus feature of a short snippet from the documentary ""Marco Ferreri: The Director Who Came From The Future"" included (other parts are scattered all over other works in his catalogue.) The image is fairly good for this vintage of film, and the photography is stunning. Imagery overcomes substance in many places (white gas masks, James Coco bursting into flames, etc.) and from a purely visual perspective the film is interesting. That the plot meanders all over creation and frequently approaches senselessness are its biggest problems, and while fans of 1970s surrealism, Ferreri, Depardieu, Mastroianni, or Coco may glean pleasure from it, ""Bye Bye Monkey"" is not a film for most viewers.",1331510400,7,5203,4.895691609977324
7886290,1,6305269092,"I've seen my fair share of art films.  In fact I've seen way too many of them.  I'm a product of the 70's and 80's art school brigade...the kind of places where the instructor thought foreign art films spoke to us about the meaning of life.  Yeah, I've seen them all from every single continent...the good, the bad and the ugly.  I've also seen most of Marco Ferreri's films.  I can't say that I enjoyed any of them.  This one stinks to high heaven.  I could barely stay awake watching this slop.  I won't even attempt to try and get into the ""meaning"" of this garbage.  All I know is that I wanted to shove that damn whistle down Gerard Depardieu's throat.  Pretentious is too nice a word to use for this one.  How about calling it a big pile of steaming CRAP!  I don't even need to tell you what the story is about because it just limps along from one boring scene to another.  It means absolutely nothing to me because it's completely dull and uninteresting.  Even the monkey was boring.  I can say that the scene with James Coco falling over and bursting into flames was rather funny...and I know that wasn't the intent...but it was funny just the same.  The most shocking thing about this 1977 film was seeing the twin towers still standing.  I  certainly could do without seeing the naked Depardieu prancing about waving his private parts in my face.  Was there anything enjoyable in this tedious experiment to torture the audience?  Well yeah, there was the naked body of Gail Lawrence (aka Abigal Clayton...star of many golden age pornographic films...YUM).  She has a fine chest and a cute face and I guess that's nothing to sneeze at.  Too bad the whole movie didn't revolve around her.  Now that would keep me awake...heh heh heh!  In fact, why don't you just skip this moronic mess and go straight to ""7 Into Snowy"" or the ""Coming of Angels""...you'll be glad you did.  You can thank me later.",1314316800,2,1904,4.497076023391813
7886291,3,6305269092,"In a nutshell, this movie is about the changing gender roles.  One reviewer suggested watching this on a rainy afternoon and I agree.  It will certainly make you nod off and maybe then all of the rich symbolism will make sense as you sleep - that, or give you horrible nightmares.

I enjoy great films by Antonioni, Pasolini and the rest who embody symbolism at its best (in my opinion) but this one....not one of my favorites.  I gave it four stars for originality but subtracted one for the long stretches of boredom and lack of real plotline (it's just one weird scene after another).  Here's my take on the film for what it's worth.

We meet Lafayette (Gerard Depardieu) as he wakes in this nightmarish vision of NYC of the 70s.  He makes his way to his job (stage hand for a feminist group that does performance art) carrying a large steel pipe to ward off the people patrolling in white hazardous suits?  Which I took to mean that the world would be a very dangerous place for men if feminists really did get their way??  The women revile Lafayette in all his primitive maleness.  They discuss a topic for their next performance: rape.  They decide to rape Lafayette to prove women are just as capable of violence.  This scene actually shows how dissimilar men and women really are - the actual act and the result are different.  For certain viewers, please note that there is full frontal nudity of both sexes in this film.  Lafayette's group of friends are a ragtag bunch of older men and one woman (she is included because she still likes men - she keeps a painting she admires of a male, her children will not visit until she takes it down).  They all hold the same view of admiring the past but the past is decaying all around them.  A giant King Kong figure lies rotting on the beach.  This group of misfits discover a baby monkey nuzzling the dead giant ape (just like nurturing and traditional mothering roles will die out from rampant feminism).  Lafayette intends to raise this monkey despite warnings that he should not and could not take care of it.  These scenes of Lafayette attempting to raise the monkey made me think that the same awkwardness and clumsy parenting would result if men tried to raise children on their own. There is also the whole constant whistle blowing thing by Lafayette.  It scares away the rats?  An underground society of rats? and since he blew the whistle at the most ardent feminist of the performance group, then she too is a rat?

The whole film is ripe with symbolism and all of this brilliant imagery is thrown at the viewer in an almost provoking manner but you need to wade through a lot of boring scenes to get to the interesting bits.  Great haunting visuals but not enough foundation was build to form a cohesive story.  I recommend this film to diehard film fans who want to edify their symbolism viewing.",1199232000,5,2863,4.546875
7886292,4,6305269092,"Is it another world, or our world gone mad?  Ferreri has quite an imagination, especially his  use of juxtaposition: a rotting carcass of King  Kong, a wax museum where James Coco  reenacts parts of history, and an underground  society where rats prevail. Depardieu, who's lines  are badly dubbed, manages to get through this  yarn uncomfortably gripping a chimp where he  found beside the dead Kong. Mastroianni is  always at his best, altho this time presenting a  more cartoonish characterization. However,  despite the exotic idiosyncrasies, this film can be  rather dull at moments. Nevertheless, I enjoyed  a large percentage of this movie, ad hominem  the ambiguous finale which may help clarifies the  film's bizarre symbolism. Watch this one on a  rainy day.",997228800,,767,5.214876033057851
