3858435,5,B00275B4CE,"Usually when adults try to do kids stuff, it's either lame or a little creepy.  These guys are so awesome.  I felt like they were 3 dads trying to entertain & teach their own kids - and having lots of fun doing it & causing me to enjoy it too!  I put this on in the morning to get my son dancing around and learning in the morning (especially on those rainy days).  After I purchased this DVD I bought 2 of their CDs too.  Then I was surprised that in the ""Extras"" section there is a whole lot more material, like an extremely clear message of the Gospel for kids that I know I can use as my child gets older.  Plus a side note - ""American Kid"" will bring out any patriotism you may have.  I'm really glad we found the Go Fish Guys!",1266796800,10,732,3.9726027397260273
