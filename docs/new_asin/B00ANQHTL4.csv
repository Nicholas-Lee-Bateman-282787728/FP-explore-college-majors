8554840,5,B00ANQHTL4,Received DVD within a few days of order. The DVD was what I was looking for as there are few videos of these 2 countries.,1456185600,,121,3.88
8554841,5,B00ANQHTL4,"I saw this show on TV and was fascinated by the people, history and culture of Uzbekistan.  The fact that it is a ""modern"" Muslim country (as in it is currently not run by religious law) makes it a strong contender for a future vacation.  The history of the Silk Road, the spectacular mosques, the gorgeous silk rugs (& very inexpensive thanks to an incredible exchange rate), fresh fruit and veggies galore...I am saving my money right now and looking forward to seeing this fascinating country in the next few years.

I was less interested in the Korea portion of the DVD.  But I'm sure it's worthwhile if you have a desire to visit that part of the world.",1432252800,3,658,4.504201680672269
8554842,3,B00ANQHTL4,"Rudy Maxa has the annoying habit of packaging interesting cities or countries with boring cities or countries. This is not a politically correct statement, but I simply don't care about Third World countries. Korea and Uzbekistan seem like such a random combination. It might as well have been Korea and Uganda. Besides Western Europe, my favorite cities are the high-tech cities in the Far East (Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore, Shanghai). Couldn't Rudy have put South Korea on the same DVD as Japan or China?

Just to justify spending my money on this DVD, I decided to watch the Uzbekistan episode. Uzbekistan is located along the former route of the Silk Road. Marco Polo used to travel along the Silk Road to China. Uzbekistan is essentially a bunch of mosques and markets. Since it's a majority-Muslim country, most of the women dress conservatively. The capital, Tashkent, is somewhat modern, but I was bored after watching 10 minutes of this episode.

The South Korea episode was much more interesting. Downtown Seoul looked nice, like Tokyo-lite. There were a lot of attractive Korean women. Kimchi is the national dish (though they also enjoy dumplings). While the Koreans party and shop, they are diligent people who study. Rudy briefly rode the Seoul Metro, which is a clean and modern subway system. He later went to a Buddhist temple out of town. Hiking is also popular in South Korea, which has beautiful forests.",1394755200,3,1439,4.991666666666666
8554843,5,B00ANQHTL4,My wife and I love this video!  We both want to go to both Korea and Uzbekistan now as a result of watching this video.  I totally want to go to Samarkand (Uzbekistan) now!,1379116800,,172,4.029411764705882
8554844,5,B00ANQHTL4,".  Rudy Maxa beats Rick Steeves hands down for traveling in style and comfort, and not traveling on the ""cheap,""  With Maxa's way, you know after a long day of sight seeing and enjoying the area, you can dine, rest, relax, take a shower and sleep in YOUR OWN suite without sharing it with a half dozen smelly, sweaty strangers who also have been traveling the world stage on the ""cheap!""  If you want to really enjoy traveling and enjoy the end of your day out after enjoying the food and sights, then travel in style like Rudy Maxa does and  you'll really enjoy it!",1372118400,2,566,4.3619047619047615
