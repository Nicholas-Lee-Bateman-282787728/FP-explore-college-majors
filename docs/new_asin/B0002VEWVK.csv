2125970,5,B0002VEWVK,"America's Heart & Soul sweeps across America in brilliant color as Americans tell the story of life in all its beautiful diversity. This is as much a story of the heart's desire for freedom as it is the story of individual contributions by creative individuals creating art by tapping into their heart, mind and soul.

Dancers play with gravity as they dance on rock faces and explain why we often feel a sense of wanting to throw ourselves into the freedom of falling. Decorated cars become moving art to bring happiness wherever they travel. Steel workers buy their factory to save their jobs and health insurance coverage. A former seal swims through traffic in New York as he delivers letters and faces numerous challenges.

There is also a sense of determination as a woman notes: ""I've been broke many times, but I've never been poor."" This story asks many questions about what it means to be rich in spirit and tells the story of how many American's find more freedom and happiness far away from the big cities.

Americans tell the story of home and belonging. There is humor, art, music and scenes in nature so profoundly beautiful it will inspire you to make plans to travel to various states. Fields of purple grapes, emerald swamps, majestic mountains and aerial views make this a stunning presentation.

Through watching Disney's celebration of the American Spirit you will get a sense of ""This is how life should be."" I loved the humor in the section with the Vermont Dairy Farmer. There are courageous, funny, passionate and memorable musical moments.

Special Features:

Four Extended Musical Performances
Behind-The-Scenes Featurette
Audio Commentary with Director/Produces Louis Schwartzberg

2125971,5,B0002VEWVK,"Sometimes we get so caught up in the politics of our country that we forget to focus on what makes it great and that is the people who live here.  This film explores diverse cultures, passions and artistic expression in a way that draws you in with your heart open to these differences. I was in awe over the beauty of the lives portrayed; some simpler then others but all full of meaning and purpose. As was stated in the film, it is about ""simply people doing remarkable things"" and that is truly the best way to describe it. You cannot watch this film without a few tears shed as you realize the message of the film and how it applies to each and everyone of us. Truly a great film that can be enjoyed more than once.",1124150400,3,720,4.217391304347826
2125972,5,B0002VEWVK,"This movie is great!  I've shared the DVD with some friends, they never heard of the movie, but after viewing they agree it's one of the best they've ever seen.  This movie reminds you about the wonderful people that live and work in the USA. It reminds you that America is not great because of our Govt., but in spite of it due to the outstanding, motivated, inspiring people.  People just living life as they desire, and at the same time adding something to everyone else's life. Another good thing is the way this movie is set-up you can watch a little at a time if you like, although I'd recommend you watch it all the way through. Great scenes, wonderful photography, fun stories and just a great feel good movie.",1123027200,3,718,4.465648854961832
2125973,5,B0002VEWVK,"I actually saw the premier of this movie in LA about a year or so ago.  I was at work and got an email saying that free tickets were available to this premier.  I went on a whim and took my then 2.5 year old son.  I thought we would be lucky to get half way into the movie before he would start fussing and I'd have to leave (that's what happened for Brother Bear and another movie we tried).  He sat there, watched the whole thing and never squirmed or asked to leave.  I on the other hand laughed through much of it, smiled through all of it, and just enjoyed taking in the outstanding scenery clips.  The film was GREAT and I thought for sure when the reviews came out, they would give this great film a strong nod.  To my surprise and disappointment, the critics seemed to not give the film a fair shake as it was probably written off as a ""goody two-shoes"" patriotic film ... I believe that they actually shunned it because they couldn't stand the thought of endorsing a patriotic film because its pass to be patriotic.  The film is great.  I actually stumbled on these reviews as I was looking to see where I could buy it on DVD.  The bottom line is that the public has been done a great disservice by the critics who were probably afraid they would been castigated by the Hollywood crowd if they gave a positive review of anything that smacked of patriotism.",1121731200,4,1365,4.276264591439689
2125974,5,B0002VEWVK,"We got to see this film when it was on limited release in the theatre and have been waiting for it ever since!!!

This film is a must see for everyone.  It shows you the good in America. It also gets you to want to go discover the samll towns around and find some of the quirkiness in the communities.

I hope that everyone sees this movie and reliezes just how wonderful our country is.",1120780800,3,387,4.133333333333334
2125975,5,B0002VEWVK,"I just saw this movie and was very moved by this full production movie documenting Americans being themselves.  The cinematography is amazing, you feel like you are right there flying over the shinning seas, purple mountains or waives of grain.  The individuals featured are true all-Americans.  Everyone will find at least one of the stories pulling your heart strings, if not all of them.  The soundtrack takes you out of the busy hectics of our everyday lives and takes away across the country.  Definately a movie to see!!!  Do not miss seeing this movie!  I'm glad I added this movie to my DVD collection and you will too!!!  Laugh, Cry & Connect with AMERICA'S HEART & SOUL!!!",1120003200,,682,4.769230769230769
2125976,5,B0002VEWVK,I saw this DVD and I have to say that I loved it.  This movie tells is a simple way what makes this country great.  It is freedom and the people of this country.  It is because of our  freedom that people can be what they want to be.  The people in the documentary are just your average Americans but their stories draw you in.  The visual part of the movie is absolutely beautiful!,1104883200,3,382,4.094594594594595
2125977,5,B0002VEWVK,"This is a very uplifting, inspiring film! I can see why this is viewed by some as the ""antidote for Farenheit 9/11"", as it paints Americans in an optimistic, yet realistic way- as strong, independent, creative, brave, and enduring. It came at a time when Moore was spewing his hate and loathing, and it was like a refreshing breeze to me. Americans are strong, independent, creative, brave, and enduring. And this film exemplifies those traits in the stories of a handful of Americans, from all walks of life, ages, and backgrounds.

It saddened me greatly that my husband and I were two of only three people in the theater, that appeared to be below the age of 50, though. I highly suggest this film to families- watch it with your kids and teens.",1098835200,7,748,4.62406015037594
2125978,5,B0002VEWVK,"For some reason that is curious to me, this movie has gotten a bad rap. You have to see it for yourself to decide, but I found it uplifting, funny, sometimes strange - and completely gorgeous to watch.

It is a collection of about 25 short vignettes of people doing what they love - pursuing their passions. Some of those passions are odd - like gluing stuff to your car - and some are astounding - like the cliff dancers of Bandaloop. Some are soulful and some are funny. But all of them are heartfelt and just beautifully presented.

I don't know how it got positioned as ""the antidote to Farenheit 9/11"", because it is not political, not polemical, and completely unrelated! About the only thing the two movies have in common is that they are both ""documentaries"" - although I have my doubts about Moore's film being a documentary at all.

Louis Schwarzberg has done a magnificent job of capturing some of the glories of this country - both the people and the scenery. I say, ""good on ya,"" Louis. I can't wait to own a copy - and give one to my family and friends. I highly, highly recommend it for a change from the routine garbage presented as fact. It's just a lovely piece of filmwork.",1098835200,15,1192,4.433789954337899
2125979,5,B0002VEWVK,"This uplifting, brilliantly filmed and edited documentary focuses on people with the courage and strength of spirit to follow their own path, and the freedom in America that makes the expression of what are sometimes odd and inventive, and even bizarre pursuits a reality. It is about those rare souls willing to live life on their own terms, and live out the dream that is in their hearts.

The creation of Louis Schwartzberg, the concept is wonderful, and the cinematography stunning. With the exception of the steelworkers struggling to keep their town and plant alive, all these stories of human ingenuity are positive and sometimes quite humorous, like the fantastic decorated cars, and the man from Colorado with the ham bullet.

Among the many images and stories that linger in my mind are the extraordinary gravity-defying, cliff-hanging ballet, the glowing, beautiful Mosie Burks, as she sings her gospel music and spreads her joy, the wisdom of the Appalachian weaver who says ""I've been broke, but I've never been poor"", ex-con and Olympic boxer Michael Bennett, helping kids to re-make their lives as he has done, and Klezmer clarinetist David Krakower playing the marvelous music of his heritage.

This is a film one could see numerous times because it is packed with content, dazzling visuals, and an overall upbeat outlook; in fact, there is no way one could absorb all that is in this film in a single viewing, or even two or three viewings.

Filled with music that delights the spirit, like Mosie's gospel songs, New Orleans jazz from James Andrews, rock 'n' roll from the Pino brothers, Marc Savoy's Cajun tunes, David's soulful clarinet, some fabulous salsa dancers, and much more. The soundtrack is by Joel McNeely with a song by John Mellencamp. Bravo Mr. Schwartzberg, for this film that celebrates creativity, and the greatness of this magnificent land. Total running time is 88 minutes.",1092873600,19,1910,5.034810126582278
2126010,5,B0002VEWVK,"wonderful and inspiring short profiles of people who contribute to the uniqueness, creativity and diversity of this country.  I use some of the short vignettes in my workshops, and they are always moving and inspiring to people.",1412640000,,228,5.162162162162162

Found out there were too many inspiring stories to choose from.

The Hoyt story was especially good.",1362441600,,180,5.172413793103448
2126014,5,B0002VEWVK,"This film is well worth the price.  I purchased 4 copies, one for me and the others were sent to my brothers and son (including 5 grandchildren ages 21 to 4 and my daughter-in-law) after seeing it on PBS.  Beautiful photography and stories about people all across this wonderful country of ours. Not the usual places, but a wide variety of locations and ordinary people dealing with life.",1290556800,,388,4.6911764705882355

2126016,5,B0002VEWVK,"My husband and i watched this 9-7-09 and are ordering DVD's as gifts for our families. They will all enjoy this show and feel the inspiration from all involved,the singer Mosie was just Awesome and the blind climber and the man with cerebral palsey who has been in 18 Boston marathons and the list goes on just amazing stories that are about real people in our great USA.The Glide church was a fabulous story that should be sent to all churches and faiths to inspire them to do more for society as a whole .L.Murray<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-s-Heart-Soul/dp/B0002VEWVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America's Heart & Soul</a>",1252368000,,673,5.673267326732673

2126019,4,B0002VEWVK,"We bought this and watched it as a family. It was fun and renewed our affections for good ol' US of A, but left you wanting more. The stories were incomplete, and often not showing the best of the people that it highlighted (like the fact that Dick and Rick Hoyt did 5 iron man triathalons was not even mentioned).

Would have been nice to have extra feature that showed who they all were and links or other info on them.

Worth buying and a great idea but could have been so much better.",1227312000,,488,4.180851063829787
2126074,5,B0002VEWVK,"I first used this video when I was teaching an American Culture class in China, and now I use it for exchange/international students who are taking the same course. It's easy to use one or two vignettes per class, or the whole thing at the same time. It really helps get rid of pre-conceived ideas about Americans. VERY USEFUL!",1204502400,,327,4.559322033898305
2126075,5,B0002VEWVK,"This is such a lovely documentary it should have received much more attention.  It was somehow, incorrectly, reviewed as a backlash to Michael Moore's movie because it came out at a similar time.  This is not a political movie and it has nothing to do with the events of 9-11.  In fact, all of the movie was shot before 9-11 occurred.  It was not released earlier because of the extensive editing and because a distributor had not yet picked it up.  I would recommend this delightful look at passions and businesses of everyday people across America.",1174176000,,550,4.6875
2126076,5,B0002VEWVK,"America's Heart and Soul is a wonderful documentary of true Americana. It renews our love of country and the people who inhabit it. It lifts our spirits and gives us to realize that no matter the bad times we go through, there are more than enough good times and places and people to constantly restore our souls. We are taken from sea to shining sea to meet the people who reach for the stars and push the envelopes.  From the Vermont farmer and his son to the soul singer/musicians in New Orleans and the oil fire fighters in Texas, we get a wonderful glimpse of the folks who prove day after day that America is still the land of the free and the home of the brave and that those who have dreams can see them come true, no matter the odds.  It speaks to the heart and gives us pause. It entices us to rekindle our own dreams and realize what is really important in this life. And most of all, it makes us realize that America is still the greatest land of all.  I recommend it for children and adults alike.  A wonderful gift to bestow on friends and family. Great cinematography, a fantastic experience that will bring tears to the eye and laughter to the heart.  I cannot praise it enough. Wonderful.",1173312000,,1205,4.337777777777778
2126077,5,B0002VEWVK,"I happened to meet Dan Klennert in Elbe Washington, who is featured on this book and video.  I was inspired and awed by his works.  Disney has done an unbelievable job of finding unique, interesting and inspirational people throughout the United States.  This book and video will just make you feel good.",1168732800,,304,4.8076923076923075
2126078,5,B0002VEWVK,"The absolute best documentary about the vast differences in America from the language of New Orleans to the language of the mountain people in NC, and the wild, wild, west.  This footage ofers places unseen by many including those who done extensive traveling.  After seeing the beauty, color, and richness of the people within the greatess nation on God's green earth, the film leaves you with laughs, tears, and joy.  You feel proud to be an american: part of such a great group of people.  Another good thing about this film is for those who enjoy traveling, this will stir you up, make you excited, and ease your worries about staying inside the U.S. to travel because after you see the wonderful colors of mountains, streams, the praire, cowboys ridin the fences like they did a 100 years ago, the big cities and everything in between you'll be amazed that you are not making some travel plans to go see some of these places for yourself.",1163203200,5,943,4.662650602409639
2126079,5,B0002VEWVK,"This is the kind of feel-good documentary that will leave you teary-eyed and longing for more human connection. The exquisite cinematography, and lilting, moving soundtrack, capture the essence of America and its people, be it those living in ""Small Town USA,"" the ""burbs,"" or on some rich, cultural urban island. The common thread is humanity, a shared sense of identity, history, goal-oriented struggle, family, and an unwavering optimism and hope for the future. Buy a copy for everyone you love or, better yet, gather all around the TV and watch it together. It was just what my husband and I needed one night to renew our faith in all that is uniquely American - our blended culture, our loyalty to God, country and family, our ties to our land and heritage, our rugged individualism, and our never-say-die dogged determination. This could bring flag waving and the Pledge of Allegiance back into style...",1145577600,,910,4.993421052631579

2126081,5,B0002VEWVK,"It's about unique Americans with unique freedoms...despite the polarizing political climate we are currently in, this video surpasses all of that with an honest and entertaining look at some amazing individuals who challenge our very notions of who we should be.  They remind us that we still have some freedoms left to live how we choose to...as long as we have the guts to do it!!!

This film is beautifully edited and perfectly executed!",1141776000,2,440,4.9324324324324325
2126082,5,B0002VEWVK,"In these days when all we seem to see and hear is bad news getting worse, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  I felt pride in my country and the people who live in it.  I enjoyed the free spirits who found their own way and reveled in it.  I loved the wonderful smile of the gospel singer.  Her smile wrote books about her life.  This is a movie you will enjoy watching and discussing with your kids, your Mom, your brother, all those people that you often wish you could watch a movie with without being embarrassed or disgusted.",1140912000,2,533,4.186274509803922

I applaud the desire to include a segment representing the Hispanic life in America.  However the dance scene with the skimpy clothing accentuated by camera angles, as well as the seductive nature of the dance moves might not fit everyone's idea of family friendly.

Otherwise, great movie!  Since it's not a traditional movie with a plot, this is one you might enjoy watching repeatedly.",1434412800,,629,4.663636363636364
