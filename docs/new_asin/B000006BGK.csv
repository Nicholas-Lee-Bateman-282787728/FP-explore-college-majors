my grandparents bought me this video back in the mid 80's, when i was pretty age-appropriate for a family film like this. the video quality wasn't the greatest, but as a kid, it didn't matter all that much. i loved it, my older brother loved it... and to this day, we're still talking about it. we converted it to dvd for ease of playing. actually, we recently had a ""wonderland cove quote-off"" which lasted quite a while.

""this is a neat looking carburetor, where'd you get it?""

i don't have kids, but i wouldn't hesitate to show them this film. some parts may be difficult to understand, but not so much that it would frustrate a kid (although nowadays, the video quality might cause complaints). a great way to spend time with the family.

""she broke the window, he grabbed her and took her inside!""
""i'm not sure what you just said, but i'm thinking maybe we should come with you?""

i'm very glad to have this video in my collection. even now when i'm in my 30's, i still love watching it.

""what are you doing?""
""i'm cannibal-sizing.""",1315180800,2,1077,4.469387755102041

7903994,5,B000006BGK,"I discovered this 1978 video a little while ago and was amazed at how good it is.  I've long been a fan of Clu Gulager, who stars in this movie, which I think was a pilot for a TV series.

This is a heartwarming movie for the whole family.  I must add it is not too saccharine; Gulager's crusty character spices it up just enough.",1090713600,6,330,4.046153846153846
