406344,5,6301971531,"While it may omit some traditional characters, this version of the children's Christmas classic is really hard to beat.  Starting with wonderful choreography and technique and ending with beautiful sets and costumes, this video is everything that it promises to be. I can show this to young students for fun or advanced students for technique.  It's great!  I also think that Baryshnikov did a wonderful job balancing the tradition begun by the Bolshoi while cleaning up the loose ends of the plot.",1051920000,,498,5.048780487804878
406345,4,6301971531,"The dancing in this version is excellent.  Baryshnikov is fantastic.  My main gripe is that he ommits some key parts.  There is no snow queen and king, sugar plum fairy nor mother ginger.  While Baryshnikov and Kirkland are beautiful and talented dancers, it doesn't mean there is no room for other lead parts (like the sugar plum fairy).  I don't regret owning it, it's just too bad it's not complete.",1039651200,7,402,4.685714285714286
406346,5,6301971531,"I first saw this in music class in 4th or 5th grade or so & absolutely fell in love with it.  I had even taped it off the radio & when I lost it, I was crushed.  So when I had a chance, I taped it off the TV, have heard various recordings, & have seen other productions of it.  I now know the music off the top of my head... so ya, you can say I'm obsessed *grin*.  I still say this is my favorite visual production of the Nutcracker... not only cuz I've seen it so many times, but when I see other productions, they just don't appeal to me as much & I end up doing something else.  I guess it's the set design & the costumes, great dancing, etc., I'm still not sure.  And as a classical musician, the National Philharmonic sounds fabulous compared to many other recordings I've heard.  Another great recording is the Berlin Symphony Orchestra.  I'm not a ballet junkie, but with so many things going for it, I think this is a great production.  I think this is appropriate enough for kids... I saw it as one!!  If you're a teacher, play this for your music class... if you're a parent, play it for your kids... culture them!!  They so desperately need it with so much bad pop culture around.  And don't forget to tell them it's by the Russian composer Tchaikovsky... & an interesting note that he didn't even like this music after he composed it!!",1039219200,3,1348,4.243137254901961
406347,5,6301971531,"A role that Gelsey Kirkland was born to dance, she can look twelve in one scene, and then when magically whisked away with her prince, she looks 21. I much prefer this version because you actually get more dancing. I am bored with the Balanchine version; quite frankly, if your child isn't in it, it is not interesting from a ballet perspective. I just saw the production in NY, and had to rush home to see the Baryshnikov one because I was not satisfied. Alas, my laser disc is no longer functional. Why wasn't this re-mastered for DVD? It should be a classic. For the person who couldn't take the ""Oedipal"" conflict,  you can easily view his  (Drosselmeyer's) role as merely summoning Clara back to reality and wakefulness. Your child won't  know to ask.",1007078400,7,756,4.626865671641791
406348,5,6301971531,"I remember seeing this when I was much younger. I had a music teacher in school who back then had a filmstrip(I know I'm dating myself) of the Nutcracker. My mother always appreciated music and we watched musicals on tv, made aware of great music, Broadway, MGM musicals, and classical.  This is I think the definitive version of Nutcracker. Baryshnikov is fantastic as the nutcracker. I love Tchaikovsky, one of the great composers of all time.  The leading lady,""Clara"" is great! I don't know much about ballet dancing but know that she was considered a great dancer. She looks young enough to have been the age of Clara. The dances are wonderful. I don't have a lot to say but that it's probably the best version of the ballet and I intend to make it a tradition to watch every year now that I own it. I will watch it with It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol(Scrooge) and White Christmas.",999993600,7,896,4.559006211180124
406349,5,6301971531,"I saw this version when I was 3 years old, about 8 years after the actual production. I knew nothing of ballet, but was quickly astounded by Gelsey Kirkland's ability to dance en pointe and the breathtaking performance of Baryshnikov. When the tape ended, I knew one thing. My dream was to become a ballerina. I kept the image of this ballet in my head as I tried to make my way in the world of ballet. Sadly, I never realized my dream, but I love ballet as much as ever. I recently had the chance to see this version for the first time in 6 years and found it everything that I remembered it being. I recommend this superb version of this ballet to any person who has a love of ballet, especially anyone like me. A warning though, buy yourself 2 copies of this because I wore the copy that I saw when I was 3 out well before I was 4.",995500800,3,834,4.091463414634147
406350,5,6301971531,"This somewhat unconventional version of the Nutcracker was produced and choreographed by Mikhail Baryshnikov, and of course he is the lead dancer. (Tony Charmoli directed.) It is Baryshnikov at his very best, better even than in ""The Turning Point."" I am amazed at his talent, ability and control. This should be on the ""must have"" list of anyone who appreciates great ballet.
In addition, it helped me understand why Baryshnikov defected from the Soviet Union to Canada in 1974. This had puzzled me, because Baryshnikov was at the top of the elite in the Soviet Union, with all the perqs that implies. But his production of the Nutcracker has intensely Russian nationalist (as distinct from Soviet) symbolism embedded in it. Tchaikovsky would have loved it; Brezhnev would not. So Barishnikov probably could not have staged anything like this in the Soviet Union of the 1970s; the All-Union censors would have insisted on changes that would have gutted it. This makes me think that Baryshnikov defected at least in part to preserve his artistic independence.
However this may be, I consider it the most compelling ballet performance I have had the good fortune to see.",987033600,,1169,5.030927835051546
406351,5,6301971531,"There is no other word for this production.  Each and every moment of it is filled with awesome and stirring interpretations of Tchaikovsky's legendary music.  The story is fresh and fascinating, much more than a framework for successive 'pas de deux's', and considerably more interesting than the traditional take.  I have watched this since I was a very small child, and every time I see something I hadn't noticed before.
  For those of you who shudder at the costumes commonly seen in ordinary productions of 'The Nutcracker,' the ones used here are gorgeous.  The staging is excellent.  And the dancing . . .
  Baryshnikov, as the Prince, meshes the character into his dancing so skillfully that it is breathtaking.  The power with which he dances, even if you've seen him before, is freshly devastating.  Gelsey Kirkland, opposite him as Clara, dances with heart-pounding perfection, and her interpretation of the role matches it.  To have both of them together is simply incredible.  Minz's dancing is also excellent, and he vanishes into the role of the mysterious Drosselmeyer.  Watching him in the ballet,  he seems to travel between two worlds; the real world, in which he is merely an old man, and Clara's dream world, into which he must follow her to bring her back.  It is never quite clear whether he is a villain or a benefactor - although it is clear that he loves Clara and believes he is doing what is best for her.
  There are no words for how I feel about this awesome ballet.  It is truly magnificent.  A chance to own it is a chance of a lifetime.",985564800,10,1570,4.702205882352941
406352,5,6301971531,"This is just the best ballet I've ever seen.  This performance of the Nutcracker is the very best that has been filmed and that I've seen.  I am not able to describe what this performance makes me feel, but I am sure  that if you see it, you will be able to feel it and discover that the  description is beyond words.  This was the very first ballet that I looked  in my life, and I fall in love with it.  The custums are all colorful and  makes you feel the story.  The dances are great, I have never seen such a  talent to dance before.  In my own experience, I have seen many  performances of the Nutcracker and I think that this is the best of all.  The music is just perfect and the choreography fabulous.  If you think that  you do not like ballet, just give a try to this video and you will discover  a new way of art.",938563200,14,825,4.0
406519,4,6301971531,"The videography in this particular production of Nutcracker is close-up, zooms in on expressions and magnifies the emotion of this ballet, unlike others that fail to get in close enough.  My young grandchildren were enraptured through most of the production.
The only thing I'm disappointed in is the color, which is washed out.  I had a previous copy on VHS whose color was vivid.  The makers of this DVD should do what they can to solve this problem.",1514764800,,452,4.769230769230769

406580,2,6301971531,"I was disappointed for a number of reasons.  While the dancing of Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland is superb, and probably for many lovers of ballet the most important part of this release, I love this ballet for the music and the spectacle as much as the dancing.  This recording was made from a television broadcast from 1977, and although they may have remastered from the original videotape, it is still in 1977 video quality -- standard definition -- and 1.33 aspect ratio, despite being presented on a Blu-ray disk.  To run in 78 minutes some cuts were made; I didn't identify them all (yet) but most notable was omission of the Arabian Dance, not my favorite part, but still.  Add in use of fancy television special effects (for 1977) to realize the magic occurrences and set changes, and my unhappiness with this presentation is complete.",1501200000,4,845,4.8068965517241375

The romantic music of the pas de deux and the dance between the Prince and Clara is the high point of the Nutcracker Ballet for me. Including Drosselmeyer in that scene, was so upsetting to me that I found myself yelling at the screen to get him OUT of there!!  Although the dancers in other versions of the pas de deux have disappointed me in that the ballerina would not trust her Prince to catch her if she jumped through the air in those most dramatic moments of the music, THIS pas de deux disappointed me and even angered me. I you are a fan of the romantic moments of the Nutcracker, don't buy this version. (My apologies to Mikhail Baryshnikov who is, of course, superb).",1485216000,3,792,4.424657534246576

It's implied that  Clara is the semi-orphaned daughter of a Russian Cavalry officer killed in the 1812 defense against Napoleon. Her mother has remarried. Clara  doesn't like her stepfather but needs a father figure in her life. That's Drosselmeyer, up to the start of Nutcracker.
Kirkland brilliantly plays this as a lonely child finding love (with  the Nutcracker) for the first time. Her dance with the prince after the death of Mouse King (i.e French invaders) demonstrates the euphoria of new love.

 No other version shows this.  Adding to the electricity it's worth noting that Kirkland and Baryshnikov were lovers at the time.  It's great!",1441238400,,807,5.2015503875969

The camerawork is a little distracting, as the closeups are too close or catch an odd angle of a character.  They should have kept to long and medium shots.  There are several attempts to truck left and right before the stage, and these are a little shaky.

The man titles were a little off putting, just showing the two leads.  All of the narration used is up front with Drosselmeyer in a little magic presentation to explain the story.  The rest is just music and dance, with one break between both acts.",1423440000,,648,4.732142857142857

  The odd camera angles and special effects detracted.  There were too many close-ups of the dancers' faces ignoring what their feet and arms were doing.  The costumes seemed brash especially those dreadful heads on the mice -- face painting would have been so much more effective. I could go on and on picking this to pieces but won't waste my time.  You get the general idea.
  The dancing is mediocre.  For most of the it all Baryshnikov did was prance about and lift an uninspired Clara.  When he finally did dance the filming did nothing to showcase his abilities.  (Nureyev is still the master; I was lucky enough to have seen him live several times.  Misha tries but fails.)  The rest of the company performed too many acrobatics and were often out of sync.
  Although an older film, Nureyev's performance with the Royal Ballet filmed at Covent Garden in 1968 shows the spectacular majesty of The Nutcracker.  That is the dvd to have.",1422662400,2,1184,4.647342995169082

My daughter's favorite dance, the one she was waiting for and anticipating, is The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. There is NO Sugar Plum Fairy in this rendition of the Nutcracker. The part of the Sugar Plum Fairy is danced by Clara, in her nightie, and it is NOT beautiful or magical. My daughter was so disappointed and confused. Also, the dance of the Mirlitons, which is my favorite, was subpar. I would rate this a two because aside from that, it's pretty good.

After realizing this I went back and read a TON of reviews  and only found one other that mentioned this. So admittedly, if I had done A LOT of more research I would have known, but it was not apparent from the description. I will keep it for now, but am not he lookout for a version that is complete.

For some reason, either I haven't been able to find it on one of the gazillion cable channels we have, or it is no longer being aired. I couldn't remember who danced the one I liked, but figured I get this one, as I love Baryshnikov's athleticism when he dances. Was so disappointed, I didn't even finish it. The dancing is far from inspired - it seems like they are all going through the motions but have no e-motion behind it. Even ""The Russian Dance,"" one of my favorites, just made me yawn. The sets look like they are made of cardboard and the costumes are horrid. Save your money on this one - wish I had.",1390262400,2,700,4.2706766917293235

That being said, I was disappointed  in the Russian Dance.  I wish he would have them do more of the low kicking steps that you want to associate with that.  Maybe I am being a little too stereotypical here, and if I offend anyone, I am deeply sorry.

productions that would be more appropriate for a young person.  Since I am new to ballet and ""The Nutcracker,"" I relied heavily on reviews and they did not speak much about age.  Again, I am sure this is perfect for someone more knowledgeable about ballet.",1389657600,2,520,4.375

While this is an older performance, I thought it deserved 5 stars but, since my wife disagrees and feels it should only have 4, I'll acquiesce and give it only 4. It's her opinion that the part of the mice was overplayed and a bit heavy-handed. She is more experienced, than I, when it comes to ballet.

In the Battle scene the tree grows huge, The transformation of the small nutcracker to the large one happens in front of your eyes. It is not one of those that just shows up at the beginning of the battle. Then, when Kirkland throws her slipper the Mouse King and the Nutcracker fall as both of them have died. Drosselmyer (sp)  encourages Kirkland to help Baryshnikov up and then the transformation from Nutcracker to Prince occurs.

For the neophyte, it's an enchanting & accessible introduction to the world of ballet, with enough color & fairy tale wonder to attract even young children; for the older viewer, there's the astonishing & sheer gravity-defying grace of the human body doing the impossible without any apparent effort. Both Baryshnikov & Kirkland are physically beautiful to watch, of course -- and in Kirkland, we have a rich portrait of a young girl on the cusp of budding womanhood, both innocent & yearning, while in Baryshnikov, we have a worthy ideal for that yearning, stirring up emotions that young girl scarcely understands yet.

The visual limitations of the videotaped image don't bother me. While a crisp & pristine HD image would be desirable, that possibility simply didn't exist at the time this production was filmed.

The sets, the costumes, and of course the exquisite music of Tchaikovsky all work superbly in this production. I don't know enough about ballet to know whether all the fine little touches are traditional, but there's humor, a lot of latent sexuality (Baryshnikov can't help it), and no trouble at all following the story. Since this is film, it is possible to take different camera angles and see the dancers close up at times, something that wouldn't work very well in a live theater. Well, perhaps with a good pair of opera glasses you could see more detail, but quite a few of the special effects would presumably be a lot more artificial on stage. For example, the very real-looking snow storm that introduces the dance of the snowflakes.

The two together are seamless with amazing chemistry (since they had an affair or were still having one).  But the other dancers are also first-rate, some later to become principals.  Alexander Minz is an incredibly handsome and sympathetic Drosselymeyer.  Plus there is no voiceover.  The choreography is excellent.  My only fault is the paleness of the color, very pastel. Baryshnikov did some rearranging of the music, omitting  Sugar Plum Fair and Dew Drop.

408112,5,6301971531,"I grew up with a recorded VHS broadcast of this ballet and even now, it still strikes me as a beautiful and emotional piece of work. Barishnikov has created exquisite and poignant choreography that's not just pretty leaping and jumping, it tells a story in itself. Echoing what another reviewer said, this is especially evident in the Act II Pas de Deux (my favorite piece from the ballet), where the emotion and romance is highly palpable compared to another Nutcracker production I have (Nutcracker: The Motion Picture--1986), where it honestly seemed that Clara and the Prince were just going through the motions. Gelsey Kirkland, Mikhail Barishnikov and Alexander Minz all execute their roles beautifully and it's simply just a joy to watch every time! Some important points:

The Arab/Coffee dance is omitted from the production because Barishnikov was under a time constraint for the televised program.

In addition to the three toys that dance for the children at the party, there is an additional puppet show that Drosselmeyer puts on for them, which is not part of the traditional plotline and foreshadows the battle between the Prince and the Mouse King.

Fritz appears but is not involved in the breaking of the nutcracker at all--that honor goes to a drunken guest at the Christmas party. In addition, the traditional reason for the breaking was out of spite, but in this version, it happens because Clara asks Drosselmeyer to make the nutcracker lifesize. The drunken party guest overhears this and coming over to Clara, pulls on the nutcracker's head trying to make it bigger, which results in it coming off in his hand.

It is heavily implied in this adaptation that this same party guest reincarnates later on as the Mouse King, as they are seen wearing similar/identical attire. As another reviewer states, this can be translated into Clara's apparent fear of men (traditionally she is in her teens or even younger), and the dream that Drosselmeyer gives Clara, especially the Act II Pax de Deux, is a therefore a form of gentle godfatherly encouragement for Clara to step out of her shell. This is only one way to analyze the adaptation. All in all, the drunken guest breaking the nutcracker is a great way of foreshadowing his later reappearance as the Mouse King, an arc that gives the story a greater sense of depth as far as Clara's psychology is concerned.

Mother Ginger does not appear in this version, and the corresponding dance number is done by four court clowns. The dance delves into the more acrobatic side of dance and for me, is always enjoyable to watch. The clowns in general are great fun as well, their acting is wonderful and they do a great job of adding humor here and there when featured on camera.

This version is, I think, less lavish than others especially in terms of sets. The second act in particular has a relatively bland set that, when darkened, fades to a murky dark backdrop and nothing more.

But when it comes down to it, this adaptation is a jewel. Strong points include tangible emotion in the storytelling, especially in the Clara-Prince-Drosselmeyer dynamic, and also the dimming of stage lights for Clara and the Prince's solo dances and their Pas de Deux, which gives the story a much more intimate feel and boosts the romance factor in the Pas de Deux. Although the sets are a bit lacking in vibrancy in Act II, that is not necessarily a bad thing as it is guaranteed not to distract from the dancing. Simply put, this is just beautiful. Some people complain about the quality, but then again, this was done in 1977, when Blu-Ray quality was still an impossible dream. Besides, it's good enough that you'll stop noticing after a while :)",1324598400,,3700,4.817322834645669

Mikhail Baryshnikov coreographed this version and took some heat in 1977 for breaking with more traditional versions. He abreviates the section with the Arabic dance et al but does not affect the over all quality. His version more closely resembles the ETTA Hoffman classic.

What can one say about Gelsey Kirkland? This performance showcases her at the peak of her abilities. Her dance lines are spot on. She never has a break, misstep or bobble. Although a very athletic performance she is smooth and effortless. This is the most perfect performance you will likely ever see. For me she will be the definitive Claira, the rest just synonomous.

This is a classic ballet but this version will take your breath away!",1315180800,2,853,4.875862068965517

THE PROBLEM: it's KULTUR again! The video is very cheaply reproduced,as usual, at premium prices.
In addition to the individual and conjoined talents, the creativeness, the staging, lighting, costumes, directing, etc-
a large part of one's experience is the quality of the physical presentation. As usual, the colors are washed out,the sound outdated.
Others, even with old material, put in the financial resources to restore quality work. KULTUR as usual is cheap and rips off the consumer.
They do the same with their DVD of the Bolshoi Ballet's presentation, incidentally.
For comparisons check out Maurice Bejart's version of the Nutcracker- on another label and The Royal Ballet's presentation on Opus Arte.
Granted these were recorded in recent times; nevertheless, check out lovingly restored DVDs by a company with integrity and you will
see and hear what I mean.

However, if you're looking for a Nutcracker that will cause you to revel in the holidays as well as Tchaikovsky's glorious music, this isn't it.
The sets by Boris Aronson range from a very ordinary parlor for Act 1 to a downright ugly fantasy candyland for Act 2. The costuming is second rate. The Chinese dancers don't look Chinese; the Russians don't look Russian. Other costuming seems cheap and uninspired. The general filming is too soft focus with not enough color contrast. And who's idea was it to have the ugly Act 2 thrones downstage blocking the action?

From a choreographic standpoint, this is also a disappointing production.
The children in Act 1 don't have much fun dancing and there are not enough of them. The adults don't act particularly well. It seems corners were cut in a lot of the dances in Act 2 which seem under populated and lacking in imagination and fire. You'd think the Russian dance in a Baryshnikov production would set your TV on fire; it is so tame and forgetable here. The Arabian dance is sadly missing altogether!

The idea of having Drosselmeyer appear in the climactic Act 2
pas de deux is a major distraction. He's simply out of place and adds no joy to the procedings. I'm sure this was meant as some deep psychological addition to the procedings, but it simply kills the moment and has nothing to do with the sublime music. And Act 2, which should end on a magical note, seems downright despressing in this production as Kirkland gazes out of a window like a lost soul???

If you want to revel in Nutcracker as a holiday treat, you must turn to the glorious Balanchine version with the NYC Ballet (on DVD) which has Christmas and joy written all over it. Sumptuosly designed, filmed and cast, it should be your first choice. The ABT version can only serve a supplementary version for a serious collection.",1241568000,19,2090,4.686648501362398

408275,5,6301971531,"There are many beautiful version of The Nutcracker but this one is magical.  Criticism of the production quality for its blue cast is correct - it's not nearly so colorful as, for example, the very recent San Francisco version.  But what makes it magical is that these are not ballet stars showing their abilities.  Baryshnikov and Kirkland and Minz ARE the Nutcracker/prince, Clara and Drosselmeyer.  All the other performances I've watched are beautiful (save one) but the story seems to get lost in the dancing.  Kirkland is beautiful, sad, excited, enchanting and vulnerable.  Her dancing is effortless and she obviously is completely in character.  Minz is Drosselmeyer - there can be no other like him.  Baryshnikov sometimes seems a little over the top but the chemistry between him and Kirkland pulls him back every time.  The choreography perfectly fits the music which perfectly fits the choreography.  The end is perfect with Clara not wanting to wake and looking through the window like a little girl wishing.

All of that removes the blue cast for me and makes this performance one I look forward to every year.  It IS a dream, after all and dreams like this one usually are softly focused.  The performance invites you to join the dream.

But, as with strawberries and blueberries - it shouldn't be watched out of season or it will become ordinary.  Watch the others for beautiful production values.  Watch this one to live in that magic moment with Kirkland and Baryshnikov and Minz and all the others who dance and act and make music so wonderfully.",1231545600,5,1565,4.893536121673004

Paired here with a prima ballerina who can keep up with him, as Kirkland can, it's even better.  Just for the sake of the dancing, I love this rendition.

Second, I do realize the interaction between Nutcracker/Clara/Drosselmeier can seem a bit twisted, but when watching this as a young adult, I figured Uncle Dross was just getting upset because Clara was falling for this fantasy guy.  As an adult, I believe it can still be argued that he is protective and is trying to wake Clara from a dream that has gotten out of control.  She doesn't want to leave the dream, or the prince, and he is trying to help her.  It doesn't have to be smutty, but you can see how that interpretation can be made.

On the downside, the original recording in 1977 had its flaws that can't be or haven't been ""fixed"" - the music can sound flat (hard to do with Tchaikovsky!) and the focus is blurry and bit blue-tinged.  But it's always been that way, even years ago on TV, so it doesn't bother me (I've loved this version for a long time).

If you love the dancing or Tchaikovsky's entire score and have no strong feelings for Baryshnikov, this probably isn't the version for you.  But if you want to see some ballet that will leave you breathless, or just love Baryshnikov, this is the one!",1229212800,6,1435,4.505791505791506

Perhaps the best interpretation of ""The Nutcracker"" ever made. Baryshnikov's finest hour. And as even the most ballet-ignorant know, that barre' is set pretty high.

I have seen Mikhail Baryshnikov dance in the much-praised chick-flick ""The Turning Point."" And I have seen him dance his own interpretation of ""Don Quixote."" Good. Great, even. But not as much as fellow Russkie ballerino Nureyev's stab at ""Quixote."" And I have seen much more of him dancing. The man defies gravity, as well as many other laws. A ballet dancer, in the country of America, has been treated like a movie star. But this may very well be his best work, artistic-wise.

Mikhail Baryshnikov is man who hardly needs an introduction, as he is a man who is synonymous with ballet. The man is a household name, Baryshnikov is at his best here, which is more than difficult, even for him. Celebrated USA ballerina Gelsey Kirkland (who was a regular partner and even girlfriend of dear Misha at the time) actually proves to be a credible match. And even takes it to a higher level than he does in HER solo scenes.

This was the first ""Nutcracker"" I've ever seen. I have seen several interpretations of ""The Nutcracker"" since then, and this one still stands as the best of the lot. There are no real children in this cast. The children's roles are played by adults in adolescent-looking wigs.

The idea to make this a movie rather than a live stage piece kind of works. It allows for more visual effects than a straight live piece would have.

There is a moment where Ms. Kirkland dances a solo all by herself, that sequence actually left be breathless. When she shakes her pointed feet like bells, the music jingles in pitch-perfect sync. She doesn't seem to be following the music at all. The music seems to be following her.

It's so beautifully and perfectly done, that as someone who takes ballet and has danced on the stage, that it actually hurt to watch.

The day that I can move as gracefully and exquisitely (on her worst day, I mean) may never come. Kirkland actually, in that one scene, manages to steal the movie away from Baryshnikov. Baryshnikov's leaps, turns, jumps and pirouettes are as breathtaking as always, and somehow never seem to get old. Misha's striking presence and Peter Pan-like mobility just.. well, makes you want to get up and dance. Or just jump around. He doesn't so much leap as much as soars.

Baryshnikov puts some little touches of humor here and there. There's a lovable old man at the Christmas Party who attempts to dance and hurts himself, as well as a toy soldier who stubs his toe. Baryshnikov has always seemingly had the soul of a child and the heart of a clown.

The Arabian Coffee Dance has been deleted for running time, I'm sorry to say. As has Mother Gigogne. Not to mention The famed ""Waltz Of The Snowflakes"" is a powerhouse, the ballet corps sway to the music so beautifully, for the briefest moment, we actually forget about Baryshnikov and Kirkland.

Is Baryshnikov trying to give himself more screen time, Clara or the ballet itself? Alexander Minz proves to be invaluable as a supporting player in the role of Drosselmyer. I was reminded of Fred Astaire. He moves around with his long, willowy limbs in a way that seemed almost inhuman. I seriously doubt ever got half the credit he deserved throughout his life.

He had an effective, amusing cameo in ""The Turning Point."" Baryshnikov continues to prove time and time again what we already know--the greatest ballet dancer of any generation will always be a Russian.

The choreography is riveting, some of the best I've ever seen. Although, the honor for ""World's Greatest"" go to ""Singin' In The Rain."" Maybe the Russian could put dances together now. He's reportedly a great teacher of dance as well.

While many of the special-effects look a bit outdated, it remains a riveting experience. After all, most ballet movies are just filmed dancing and this one takes the effort to actually be something of a movie.

The acting is not much, nor is there as much plot as is traditional, a as this ""Nutcracker"" focuses more on the dancing and music. The pyrotechnics (the dancer's rapidly-moving muscular limbs and the way they and the music truly gel).

Despite Mr. Baryshnikov in the title role and given prominent first billing, the star of ""The Nutcracker"" is Gelsey Kirkland as Clara, as this is all Clara's story.

Mnay movies have attempted to translate this legendary dance story to the screen, usually with disastrous results. For example, the mistake the 20th Century Fox movie ""George Balanchine's The Nutcracker"" made was if they were going to made the ballet into a movie, they should have done something for the movie that they couldn't do for a live production. Alas, they did not. It moved so slowly and the whole movie was so badly-lit, it looked like somebody boot-legged the whole thing with a camcorder.

The solo duets are just as enjoyable. The dancers, are in fact, so good that they almost threaten to outdo the leads.

It's a beautiful story, more with flair and style in it's depth. It's a revised fairy tale.

When Misha and Gels prance together, their body movements almost in perfect parallel... it's beautiful and breath-taking. They seem to be connected internally somehow. These are two people... brought together by dance. It's every little girl's dream... and that's exactly what the ""Nutcracker"" should be.

As someone who dabbles in cinema photography, I can appreciate the cross- fades between many of the sequences in this production for televiewing.  This adds another dimension, that cannot be seen in a public performance.  Also, there is a wider choice of good camera locations in the television production of any ballet.

The dancers were all great - in particular Baryshnikov, Kirkland and the court jesters.  Although Kirkland was 24 years of age at the time of this production, she was very convincing in the role of the young teen-age Clara.  Baryshnikov was equally convincing as the dashing young prince.  And last, but not least, the musical score is magnificent.  I was particularly amused by the way that Tchaikovsky worked the tune of a French children's song, Cadet Roussel, into the middle of the court jesters' dance.

In short, the Nutcracker is about a young girl becoming a woman and the sexual conflicts involved. Her dream is clearly sexual. She fights off the mice who represent her ""dirty"" sexual impulses and lascivious temptations including that of being ""conquered"" by the Mouse King. Finally, with the arrival of the Nutcracker Prince and his help, she is able to sublimate these impulses into a mature love for a protector who marries her (the Nutcracker prince) and who makes an ""honest woman"" of her. Proper versions of the ballet always have the Christmas tree swell and rise to gargantuan size, like the big phallis it represents. Ballets that fail to do this indicate a lack of understanding of what the ballet is all about. However, children can enjoy it without necessarily having the sexual meanings made explicit to them.

408445,5,6301971531,"I have grown up with Baryshnikov's Nutcracker.  I don't understand the review discussing the ""perplexing pas de deux"" issue.  When I was 7 years old I don't recall sensing anything sinister or improper about Uncle Drosselmeier's behavior towards Clara.  The narrator explains at the beginning of the story that Drosselmeier is giving his godchild ""the gift of a dream.""

Sigh!  I suppose next some enterprising critic will suggest that the entire premise of ""The Nutcracker"" is socially/sexually deviant because the love match involves a young girl and a toy, that the Nutcracker/Prince endorses an unhealthy female dependence on ""Prince Charming"" complex, and that the battle with the mice indicates a rodent fetish.

The storyline has to be taken in context with the era in which it was originally conceived.  It is the story of a young girl nearing adulthood and the complexities of adult choices such as finding a life partner.  Drosselmeier's interferences at the end were meant to draw Clara free from the fantasy/dream and keep her from being ""lost"" in it.  Surely no one here thinks a responsible parent/guardian would simply allow an adolescent girl to run away with the first beau she falls in love with?

The themes of the dances also indicate Clara's more childish side longing to be ""more grown up"".  She is dreaming about sweets and flowers (traditional courting gifts at the time as well as the present.) Her costume change (from girl's nightgown to evening dress and crown) indicate a sort of temporary maturity for the sake of the dream.  In the end she returns to her nightgown.

My perception of this production has changed throughout the years and I analyze it much more deeply as an adult than I did when I was a child.  At no time did I ever perceive Drosselmeier as a pedophile or even a sinister character.

Most artistic interpretation relies upon whatever the viewer's perception of the art form is.  I perceive it as a coming-of-age story, the prequel of a young Victorian miss longing but still not quite ready to wear grown-up gowns and receive gentlemen callers, etc.

I've read criticism of the ballet's production values.  It is still beautifully, lovingly done given its age and I appreciate the simplicity of the sets because they don't overwhelm the principles.

This is a precious children's faerie tale with some of the best artistic talent (both dance and music) of its time.  It should be savored lovingly with hot chocolate and friends and family, particularly young people.",1134777600,40,2514,4.954653937947494

Ignore the amateur critics who try to tell you that there is some kind of sinister, pedophilic undertone to the relationship between Clara, danced by the incomparable Gelsey Kirkland, and her Uncle Drosselmeyer, danced by Sasha Minz.  He is her godfather, she is his niece, nothing more.  He gives her the gift of a dream, and when the dream is over, he comes to take her back to reality.  There is nothing sinister here.  THIS VIDEO IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN!

As a highly trained ballet dancer who has loved this version of the Nutcracker for many, many years, I can say without hesitation that this is absolutely the best version available.  The Balanchine version, no matter which company dances it, is cheesy and uninspired.  The choreography is dry and simplistic.  I've never been a fan of Balanchine, who dumbed down the art of ballet until it was almost depressing.  Baryshnikov's version is a breath of fresh air, and watching him with Ms. Kirkland will take your breath away.  There's a reason the 1970s were the (albeit brief) American dance renaissance.  This version brings life back into the ballet.  If you haven't had the pleasure of catching this unbelievable ballet on PBS, do not hesitate to buy it.

If you're interested in purchasing a classic ballet that will inspire your children's as well as your own imagination, this is it!

 I think the concerned reviewers that mentioned that this version of the ballet has ""adult themes"" are using a pretty strong term for what many people feel suggests an overprotective godfather's reaction to his little girl growing up and becoming interested in boys. This interpretation is featured in lots of Nutcracker productions, and is taken to varying degrees -- this one is really benign! Let's not forget that a lot of the Nutcracker's story takes place as Clara's dream, and SHE dreams his reaction to the Nutcracker prince and every other portion of the ballet that takes place in the ""Land of Sweets"" (including the sultry Arabian Dance and the pas de deux). This is a WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, UPLIFTING and FUN ballet -- isn't that what we're looking for in the Nutcracker?",1131926400,27,1152,4.755

I've always found ""The Nutcracker"" boring and syrupy in plot, though I enjoyed much of the music and some of the dancing.  Yes, this ABT version has an ""adult"" theme (or several) -- but I find this enriches the ballet for me and it's interesting to try to figure out who's who and what's what among the characters.  (I've really enjoyed reading other reviewers' interpretations!)

Meantime, my three-year-old daughter is enjoying the story from her new-to-ballet point of view.  The ""adult stuff"" goes right over her head.  She's interested in the silly people dressed up like mice, the ""big machine that makes fog"" (the cannon), the Christmas tree that grows, etc.  She gets out one pretty dress after another from her closet and tries them all out as ""dance suits"" as she twirls around the diningroom imitating the dancers' dramatic arm movements.

I find Baryshnikov's choreography fresh, free, and full of life.  And full of surprises -- for example, I love the dance where Clara is gracefully tossed from one male dancer, or pair of male dancers, to another.  I've read that Baryshnikov felt stifled by the strict classical choreography of the Soviet ballet, and in this ""Nutcracker"" I see him breaking free of that stifling tradition and creating a beautiful, thought-provoking, and -- yes -- provocative (for adults) new dance.

Baryshnikov's dancing is spectacular -- his strength, form, precision -- and rich in feeling.  Kirkland's dancing is near perfection and her portrayal of her awakening feelings for her prince is excellent.  The choreography is, again, rich in feeling and meaning and just plain rich, rich, rich.

I'm sure my daughter and I will watch this ""Nutcracker"" hundreds of times over the years and it will continue to be a rich and fulfilling and inspiring experience.

408521,5,6301971531,"While some complain that a romantic version of the nutcracker is to hard to explain to children, and than complain that the romance, which the children do not understand, makes this film inappropriate, I will speak from experience. I grew up in a very consrvative home and viewed this film every christmas for as long as I can remember. As a child I did not understand the subtle romantic plot, but enjoyed the obvious and familiar plot along with the costumes and music and so forth. As an adult I was inraptured with the more subtle and sublime romance beautifully and artistically portrayed. Obviously the romance is not vulger or it could not be so subtle, those who grossly exagerate and twist a simple romanic fairytale on the same level as slepping beauty or cinderella, simply mimic the review of one critic at the time who just wanted to get attention buy writting something different. After all how inappropriate can a BALLET, made decades ago be??? Especially compaired to even childrens entertainment today. Come on people!!! Don't just drum up contraversy because your bored or to lazy to form an opinian for yourself.

My advice is buy it, see it for youself, it WILL become a treasured holiday tradition, and if in the end you don't agree with me you can return it. But I think you will find Barysnikov's performance stunning, Kirkland's performance lovely, and the multi-level storyline much more entertaining while preserving the basic themes that the author intended and that we have all come to love.

It IS wonderful! I Give you my word!",1125273600,28,1557,4.8277153558052435
408522,5,6301971531,"Probably the most popular of all ballets, Tchaikovky's ""The Nutcracker"" is pretty much required holiday viewing for children and the experience is one to be shared with parents, too.  The sparkling score, by turns intensely dramatic and supremely exhilarating, is as familiar as any Christmas carol or hymn.

The essential problem with the ballet's original staging is that the story line falls apart in the second act. The first act has a reasonable plot line given that this is a child's dream story.  But after Clara helps the Nutcracker defeat the Mouse King and he turns into a handsome prince, they depart for the Kingdom of Sweets and, after the Waltz of the Snowflakes, the story line evaporates. Once the pair arrive in the Kingdom, poor Clara sits out the entire second act watching a succession of sweet treats dance the audience into diabetes, while Prince Charming deserts her for the Sugar Plum Fairy.  In other words, the original staging gives the entire second act no plot line whatever, only a succession of divertissements with solo turns and a final pas de deux for the prince and the Sugar Plum Fairy.

Mikhail Baryshnikov's inspiration was to give this fragmented succession of dream images into a coherent story.  Unfortunately as witness Celia Franca's infamous ""it makes me want to vomit"" rant, Baryshnikov's version is often misunderstood. Clara is not having an affair with Drosselmeyer, nor does he desire her.

The key to understanding Baryshnikov's interpretation is the Mouse King. It is immediately obvious from the King's costume--a long purple frock coat & short violet cape--that he is Clara's dream transformation of the drunken adult male party guest who wrenches off the Nutcracker's head (replacing Clara's brother as the culprit). In fact the mouse army are ALL Clara's dream transformations of the male party guests, including the paunchy, bemedalled general who throws out his back dancing the Champagne Promenade with Clara's nurse. (In the party scene, the guest who injures the Nutcracker is the ONLY one wearing a frock coat; all the other adult males [except the general] wear cutaways.)

In other words, the adult males are threatening to Clara (& this pretty much rules out any notion that she's involved with Drosselmeyer).  Her dream, Drosselmeyer's gift as Baryshnikov's prologue explains, gently allows her to discover the womanly feelings with which her dawning womanhood endows her. At the party, then, Clara is a child among children, playing with toys (including the Nutcracker) as any child would.  Her unexpected tenderness for the Nutcracker foreshadows her adult emotions for the prince after she helps him defeat the same individual who broke the toy during the party. Baryshnikov's staging of the first act stresses this theme by juxtaposing and contrasting the adults' and children's experiences of the party, in contrast to versions that foreground the children, such as the familiar Royal Ballet staging.

In the second act, Clara discovers new depths to her feelings.  By banishing the Sugar Plum Fairy, Baryshnikov as the prince keeps Clara in the foreground and their near-ecstatic dances reveal her growing ease with adult feelings.  But in the end,  Drosselmeyer reappears to usher Clara out of her dream: her transformation into womanhood must take place in the real world, not in a dream fantasy.

As has been noted often enough, Baryshnikov was constrained to omit the Arabian variation in order to keep the film within the time frame for a television broadcast.  This is unfortunate, as one can only imagine what he and Kirkland might have done with it.  Mother Ginger is absent. Otherwise the score is intact; the familiar Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy survives with its angelic celeste accompaniment, here danced by Clara. The choreography for this number is the high point of Baryshnikov's tale: Clara's wonderfully hesitant yet ecstatic foot-dragging is forecast in her first-act pas de deux with the prince and reappears in a pendulum-like step in the second-act pas de deux (which she and the prince here share with Drosselmeyer).

The production values in the film are high with the exception of the scenery, which could have been more literally rendered; the backgrounds are often murky to the point of mystery.  But the uniformly outstanding dancing and excellent costumes go a long way to offset this one minor liability.

The small changes in this are insignificant when it comes to how wonderful the dancing is and like many others have stated, I prefer the Clara and the Prince dancing the Pas de deux rather than the Sugar Plum Fairy.  That brings me upon the only thing I have a problem with.  The fact that Drosselmyer is dancing the pas de deux.  Others have mentioned pas de trois and I can see that term as fitting.  This dance number is supposed to be a beautiful and romantic dance that has absolutely gorgeous music to go with it, but the prescence of Drosselmyer takes all that away.  It is rather creepy.  I think that it would have been so much better if he had been left out of that dance number.

They all lack true feeling. If you read memories of soviet balletdancers, you realize, how monotonous was the repertory politics in Kirov or Bolshoi Ballett. ABT gave Baryshnikov a chance to do things differently and who can claim that it's bad?

Example:rewier ""rss28"" claimes that the great pas de deux is actually pas de trois...only because Drosselmeyer appers to be in the scene! I see it otherwise. Mr. Drosselmeyer is NOT a person here, but he appers to be the TIME.

For those of us who watched them on stage, it was a magical partnership even if at the time we did not know its tragic undertones.  Other than an occassional outing with Makarova, Baryshnikov was never as evenly or stimulatingly matched.  Pity there is no record of their Giselle or La Sylphide or Gelsey's ""The Leaves are Fading"".  Both artists were at their peak when they danced together, and their peak to this day remains of the highest order. So, we are lucky that some record exists.

Unfortunately, one wishes this were a better document.  This is a studio performance, and at times looks rather cramped. For some reason, even on DVD, everything seems taped in soft-focus, with a bluish gauzy overlay that becomes irritating.  The choreography is thoroughly undistinguished if not boring. As noted elsewhere, the Arabian Dance is missing. It's fun to spot some ABT regulars of the period such as Warren Conover and George de la Pena, even if they don't do much.

Kenneth Schermerhorn should respect Tchaikovsky's music if he wants to be a conductor. The only part orchestral-wise I liked was the part when the christmas tree grew enormous and the mouse king and his subjects appear toward that climax. There are better orchestral performances of The Nutcracker available. A more complete one would be the New York City Ballet with David Zinman conducting. The percussion section there is much larger than on here, and the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden with Evgeny Svetlanov conducting the orchestra.

The casting is perfect, with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland taking the lead.  Alexander Minz is perfect as Drosselmeyer, and the ABT company members portray the peripheral roles with skill and elan.  Particular variations that stand out to my mind are that of Columbine and Harlequin, the Spanish dancers, and Dance of the Mirlitons.  Why they left out the Arabian variation, I'll never know...but that doesn't ruin the viewing experience.
I actually prefer this plot to that involving the Sugarplum Fairy - this, which I believe follows closer to the traditional Russian storyline, focuses moreso on the dream of Clara, and her adolescent awakening. Rather than planting her on a pillow (to stay from then on) upon her arrival in the Land of the Sweets, she remains involved, dancing a yearning pas de deux with the Nutcracker Prince.  It makes the ballet far more interesting, and not such a little girls' fantasy (which can get a bit mawkish after a short while).  The frequent involvement of Drosselmeyer throughout the ballet reinforces this, and creates a magical effect.
The sets and costumes are glorious - not a weak moment therein.  The ladies' gowns in the opening party scene are just spectacular.  Also, the musical performance is beautifully handled.",1078358400,18,1452,5.07563025210084
408582,4,6301971531,"From that night in the winter of 1988, when I was three years old and first watched a recording of ""The Nutcracker"" starring Gelsey Kirkland and Mikhail Baryshnikov, I was spoiled for almost every other rendition of the ballet.  Never mind that, during the recording, someone must have changed the channel and replaced Harlequin's dance with commercials and a small segment of an episode of The Munsters, but it is still a timeless, ALMOST flawless interpretation.  My main qualms with this version, though I did not perceive of any flaws at the time given my tender age, had to do with content.  In an effort to fit the broadcast into a 90-minute format including commercials, some portions of the score, some minor routines-and, most glaringly, the Arabian dance ""Coffee""-had to be omitted.  The reinterpretation of the Pas de Deux between the Sugarplum Fairy and her Cavalier to a Pas de Trois between Clara, Drosselmeyer and the Prince-a fight between fantasy and reality over a girl who dared to dream-was well done and reestablished a plot line where previously there had been a Divertissement of mostly ethnic dances.  ""Tea,"" the Chinese Dance, stands out in my mind as one of my favorites.
I wanted to give this four and a half stars, but unfortunately that is not possible.  But all in all, this is a magical interpretation of a magical ballet, and is an essential purchase for any fan of the Nutcracker.",1071360000,6,1413,4.842323651452282
408583,5,6301971531,"Content and subject matter aside, this is one of, if not the, finest example of filmed ballet. Ballet is a theatrical art in real time. That is where true vituosity is revealed. That's why camera technique, overused in every production I have ever seen, is the biggest drawback to a good represention of ballet. You can see the dancer in full figure for most of this production. I can't wait until this comes out in DVD. Barysnikov's overall concept and story changes allowed for maximum exitement in the execution. It also showcases two virtuosos at their peak. (So what if there is no Snow Queen, etc.) This to me is what makes it a most important video. A little tidbit: because of the straightforward manner of shooting, very close scrutiny of the performances is posible. It is known that Barysnikov had less than stellar moments in his partnering. Watch for the lift where he slams Gelsey's foot into the floor. Much more should be said about Kirkland's importance to the success, beauty, and passion of this most adult production of a children's classic. (Sad she didn't do more filmed work.) For me it is the only thing that is able to reconnect me as an adult to childhood Christmas fantasy.",1069718400,3,1200,4.719047619047619
408584,5,6301971531,"I've converted many Nutcracker-naysayers with this video. They see it: the costumes, the puppets, the snowflakes that Misha envisioned, and they say ""Wow! I didn't know it was like that!"" Certainly, it is. Between this and Pacific Northwest Ballet's version, it's a toss-up about which choreography is better in terms of story, phrasing, clarity, and line. There is a distinct Russian flavor, particularly in the Waltz of the Snowflakes, which looks like it was lifted from the Kirov of Misha's early career.  There are some jarring camera angles in this version that cut dancers seemingly in half, but really, I'm nitpicking. Gelsey's Clara in ACT I is what this ballet should be: pure dancing and mime in the context of a child's experience. What might be going on around her is just acting, but Gelsey (much to her credit) always searched for truth. It comes through the character of Clara quite nicely. And Misha? Watch him and gasp--his solo variations are breathtaking. I would have liked to see the Indian variation and less spotty camera-work, but who cares? Overall, this is a pastel dream. If you know nothing about dance, you'll still walk away feeling as if something great touched you. It will!",1063843200,8,1207,4.945812807881773
408585,5,6301971531,"Getting right to the point - I don't believe that this version of the ballet is ""kinky"" as other reviewers have suggested.  I believe they are missing the obvious. Clara as portrayed in this version is a preteen girl, on the threshold between childhood and womanhood.  Victorian girls were innocent far longer than girls are today; Clara and her friends still play with dolls, as young Victorians did.  She innocently develops a crush on the imaginary Nutcracker prince.  Yes, she has a special relationship with Godfather Drosselmyer, but his participation in the pas de deux is not ""kinky;"" rather, he is calling Clara back to reality.  As a loving father figure, he reminds Clara that the Nutcracker is just a fantasy and that she must wait for a while before finding her ""real"" prince someday.  It makes perfect sense to me and is in no way inappropriate, in my opinion.
As a professional musician, I have always felt that something was missing from the syrupy sweet productions that portray Clara and the prince as young children.  The music is amazingly passionate, full of all the emotion that a young lady on the verge of womanhood is feeling.  As to the ""elimination"" of certain characters (Sugar Plum Fairy, Snow Queen, Snow King), there is always a great deal of liberty with ballet scores as far as the dramatization goes.  Clara and the Prince double as  the Sugar Plum Fairy, the Snow Queen, & the Snow King.  That was not a drawback for me.",1063065600,15,1455,4.734126984126984
