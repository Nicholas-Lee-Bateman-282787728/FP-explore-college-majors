4215036,5,B003X3BYHE,"I never saw Troll 2, but this documentary makes me want to. A touching, funny and sometimes plain weird portrait of some of the 'actors'  who starred in the best worst movie ever.",1291075200,,179,4.424242424242424
4215037,5,B003X3BYHE,"As a fan notes in ""Best Worst Movie"", the worst movies are never made
that way on purpose but inherit their serious badness from the
sincerity with which they were made. Thus was the case with Troll 2,
which the director Claudio Fragasso inconceivably insists was an
earnest work of art. This documentary, put together by the actor who
played the son in the 1990 film, catches up with Fragasso as well as
the writer (Fragasso's wife) and cast of Troll 2.

Many terrible films have acquired cult followings--most notably of
recent times Tommy Wiseau's The Room--but to my knowledge, Troll 2 is
the only one which is itself a subject of a documentary. Michael
Stephenson does an excellent job in conveying not only Troll 2's infamy
but also the general ""it's all in fun"" attitude of fans who love truly
bad movies. Even if you haven't seen Troll 2 (although I highly
recommend you do!), I think you'll find this documentary interesting,
hilarious, and even touching. Even my 14 year old son, who's as yet too
young to appreciate epic badness in movie making, wandered into the
room while I was viewing this and ended up sitting and watching it with
me.

Much of the documentary centers around George Hardy, who played the dad
in Troll 2, and his attending of conventions and Troll 2 screenings as
well as his efforts in trying to get the other actors to participate in
a Troll 2 reunion. The jovial Hardy is impossible to dislike and
without his cooperation ""Best Worst Movie"" wouldn't have worked nearly
as well. His upbeat attitude lends a balance to the proceedings as we
discover that many of the other actors involved in Troll 2 are these
days embarrassed, bitter, depressed, or in at least two cases
clinically insane.

Fragasso, by turns astounded and angry that so many people laugh at his
film, is a dour presence throughout, but in the end offers the most
relevant wisdom. Movies, he says, are about moving the audience, and
Troll 2 is by those standards a great success. Fortunately, the same
can be said about ""Best Worst Movie"", which is well worth a look.",1289865600,13,2067,4.673076923076923
4215038,4,B003X3BYHE,"The movie is great. After I saw this movie at AFI theater (AFI Silverdocs), I was eager to see it again. This DVD does not disappoint.

The special features include: Claudio and his wife discussing the process of how they made the movie; George Hardy's PSA about hospitality in movie theaters; interview with Deborah Reed the Troll Queen; extended interviews; plus more.

With the exception of George's PSA, none of the extra stuff are as exciting as the movie. However, they are certainly satisfying.

I can't imagine die hard fans of Troll 2 skipping this DVD. I also assume fans of the documentary will enjoy this disc.

Anybody who is curious about Best Worst Movie, but has not seen Troll 2 or the documentary, should watch Troll 2 somewhere (might be free on hulu). If you find Troll 2 interesting, you can not miss this film about the worst movie.",1289865600,,854,4.673333333333333
4215039,4,B003X3BYHE,"What happens when you make a documentary on the worst movie ever made? You end up with the BEST WORST MOVIE, a behind-the-scenes look into the lives of the cast members and the fans of the cult-phenomenon TROLL 2. Michael Stevenson (better known to the fans as the young Joshua) directs this touching and humanizing documentary, where he tracks down the entire original cast along with the screenwriter and director for candid interviews. After spending years hating the movie that effectively ended his film career, Stevenson has finally embraced its notoriety after realizing what a positive effect it has had on its underground fan base. George Hardy, Margo Prey, Connie Young, and even Grandpa Seth, himself, share stories about their experiences on the production that are both sad and utterly hilarious. Hardy steals the spotlight for the majority of the film, and seemingly holds the camera hostage as Stevenson documents their travels screening the picture around the world. Stevenson also transports the cast members to the original shooting locations to re-film many of the classic scenes in one of the film's most entertaining moments. Watching an aged George Hardy strap an adult Michael Stevenson over his shoulder while delivering his famous line ""You can't piss on hospitality"" is a sure crowd-pleaser.

For all of the people out there that thought they were alone in their secret obsession with the film, BEST WORST MOVIE explores the depths of TROLL 2's fandom across the globe, interviewing fans and critics alike on how they first found out about the movie and why it continues to have such a huge following now twenty-years later. After listening to the devastating effect that the film's harsh criticisms have had on several of the cast members, the documentary also causes reviewers to re-evaluate each of the negative remarks they have made over the years. The biggest surprises come in the form of writer Rossella Drudi' and director Claudio Fragasso's existentialist views on their cinematic travesty, but they do make deep and meaningful observations on TROLL 2's lasting impact. Fragasso states that the only measure for a good film is that it moves someone on an emotional level. By that standard, TROLL 2 may be one of the greatest films ever made. As corny and cliche as it sounds, TROLL 2 fans will laugh, they will cry, and they will fall in love with the film all over again after watching BEST WORST MOVIE!

4215040,5,B003X3BYHE,"I caught this at a little indie theater in Ohio with my friend even though I only knew the basic jist of Troll 2.  It was probably one of the funniest and fascinating movies I've seen in a long time.  You really get to see how personalities affect the outcome of a film.  I'm not one to really have a gut busting laugh in a theater, but this movie produced several.  The timing on the jokes, the provoking story, the characters you meet throughout...What a great movie. Totally worth every penny without any disappointment.  If you didn't manage to catch it in theaters, this is the perfect chance to see it at home.  DO IT.",1284595200,14,624,4.3826086956521735
4215041,5,B003X3BYHE,"Managed to catch this at a local indy theater, having been a Troll 2 fan for ages. I was fully expecting Best Worst Movie to be funny and entertaining -- which it was -- but what caught me off guard is just how touching and effecting it is. While the proceedings are constantly enlivened by George Hardy, the actor who played the father in Troll 2, many of the other actors lives have not gone so well. There's the sadly comic shopkeeper, who was on leave from a mental institute at the time Troll 2 was filmed, and the twilight years of the actor who played Uncle Seth. But seeing the actress who played the mother from the movie is downright unsettling , even tragic.

On the flip side, seeing the director and writers of Troll 2, and witnessing their fervent belief that they made an insightful, important film that was simply ahead of its time... it's like an Italian knockoff of Ed Wood, only less friendly. And while Fergasso comes off as a buffoon much of the time, there are moments where you really see how truly and honestly he believes in his films -- whether that is for better or worse is another issue entirely.

All of that, plus investigating the cult that has sprung up around this fantastically bad movie... I really have to say, Best Worst Movie is a genuinely very good film, far better than anything springing from Troll 2 has any real right to be. Highly recommended.",1282521600,45,1389,4.486166007905139
4215042,5,B003X3BYHE,"I thought this documentary was funnier than the movie it was about. It takes you inside public perception of the movie and how it slowly became an underground sensation, while also giving you feedback from those who participated in the biggest cinematic failure of all time. Some of the actors have gone on to live happy, full lives while others have wound up in rather sad situations. Best Worst Movie also shows the reaction of the director Claudio Fragrasso to his ""masterpiece"" and how he describes it as being ""the inspiration for Harry Potter."" He also portrays disdain for the actors who were in the movie and wonders why people laugh at parts of the movie he believes to be serious. The majority of this movie focuses on the dad (George Hardy) and the kid (Michael Stephenson) from Troll 2, with the kid being the director of BWM. They travel to numerous conventions, screenings, and, in addition, hunt down the actors from Troll 2. This movie took a few years to make, produce, and distribute and I believe that's what makes it so great. It's a well-thought-out movie and it does not disappoint. Those who have never seen or heard of Troll 2 can get a better understanding of the craze behind it and how it failed miserably. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a state-of-the-art documentary. Well done, Mike and George!",1282348800,16,1338,4.722222222222222
4215073,5,B003X3BYHE,"How can so many people feel something special for what in my opinion is one of the worst movies of all time which is Troll 2. This documentary shows you how that can be true. The interviews from the cast, the director and the writer gave an insightful veiw on why this movie went terribly wrong, even through sometimes they themselves don't believe so. George Hardy who played the dad in the film was a good choice to follow through the course of the doc because you can see that he enjoyed being in Troll 2 but he has also moved on from that.",1497398400,,543,4.230769230769231

It follows the young star of the film TROLL 2 as he reconnects with his former castmates, attends TROLL 2 screenings and fan events, and dissects what appeal this terrible, low budget horror film has for its devoted fans.  They note in the film that this movie has been called ""the Facebook generation's ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW"" and the film does have a certain charm to it that works well with the midnight movie format.  The cast themselves are all interesting and quirky people, and the director is fascinating: he sees TROLL 2 as a legitimate art movie, a great movie with a powerful message.  All of these wild and wonderful personalities mix together in this entertaining documentary that, if watched before watching TROLL 2, makes that movie almost entertaining!",1450224000,3,899,4.628930817610063
4215080,1,B003X3BYHE,"Interesting, good pace, enjoyed it until Stephenson paid a visit to one of the stars unannounced.  She invites him into her home and it is so obvious that the years since Troll 2 have not gone well, and there appears to even be a mental health issue with her.  The whole segment is painful because Stephenson's treatment of her is malicious in a juvenile mocking sort of way (e.g. Closeups of various cat pictures and other decor in a home that likely hasn't seen a visitor in years and was not prepared to receive this visitor!) That one WTF scene was enough to go from 4 to 1 stars.  To make sure I wasn't being too harsh I checked to see if Stephenson had ever explained why he shot that scene the way he did. I found further mockery of the woman. Mocking mental illness is not original or funny.  I won't be surprised if looks back on those comments and that scene with embarrassment.  Hopefully soon.",1447200000,6,905,4.395209580838324

If you haven't seen Troll 2, the so-bad-it's-good movie that this documentary focuses on, don't worry about it. There are enough clips of the movie throughout to understand what the hype is about, and the ""story"" is explained as far as you need to know it.",1404345600,,734,4.470149253731344

With that said it is almost like the George Hardy show.  Ironically I didn't notice his character nearly as much in the troll 2 movie as I did the kid, Grandpa Seth and the sister.

This film takes a look at Troll 2 which is considered by some to be the worst movie ever made.  To be honest, I hadn't see it at the time, but you don't need to in order to fully enjoy the film.  The filmmaker (a child ""star"" of the original Troll 2) tags along with the original star of the film, a truly likeable dentist George Hardy as he discovers the cult status of his brush with the film industry.  Much of the original cast makes appearances but make no mistake, George livens the picture with his jovial personality.  Even when things seem like they could get awkward (George at a horror convention or Troll 2's director at a reunion) they manage to steer clear of the uncomfortable while still capturing things like some of the cast's disdain for the filming or the director's genuine belief that it's a meaningful and important film.

I feel bad for some of them, especially the actress who played the daughter since she was so awful and it's haunted her to this day.  I did feel it started to drag when they were hitting all the comic con type festivals though.  The ones where it was a hit were great, but then there were a lot without any fans and that felt kind of awkward.  All in all, this was a really great documentary.

The other fans interviewed have a lotta heart and soul but the best moments on this documentary about the best worst movie ever made, that is TROLL 2, are shots of the actual film with the actors commenting and telling stories about their involvement in the wonderfully horrible horror film.

Sure there could have been more cast members interviewed, like Deborah Reed, who played the Troll Queen... and some of the participants, like the actress who played the mother and the actor who played the grandfather, seem a bit exploited, but this is really all about George Hardy.

An Alabama dentist living in Utah at the time, George plays the TROLL 2 father with beautifully hammy delight, and in this documentary we follow George going from fan-saturated screenings to tedious autograph shows to his life at in a small town full of adoring family and friends.

And some great scenes include TROLL 2's Italian director Claudio Fragasso, who doesn't realize he made a bad movie, much less the best worst one, thus providing a sort of antagonist as he argues with cast members and holds on that his film was actually good.

Well perhaps he's right: not many other bad cult films have this big a following and/or this good a documentary about how it touched so many fans, myself included.",1350691200,,1506,4.844357976653696

If you do not watch this documentry and the original film you are a fool. This film is one of the best horror films of all time!!,1346198400,,278,5.2
4215142,4,B003X3BYHE,"Well maybe Troll 2 is the worst movie ever - I haven't seen it - but what about ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""?  Who says T2 supplanted that gem?  I guess we'll have to line up a double feature to see.  I think one thing we learn from this documentary is that what makes a best worst viable is the fact that the filmmakers are genuinely serious about the film and actually think the final product is pretty good.

Troll 2 is clearly for followers of this genre, i.e. crappy movies.  The movie is so bad that it's funny.  Even when it's not supposed to be funny.  Clearly, the director and writer and even the star were hurt by the laughing at times.  I don't think the Italian director ever got it.  He and Ed Wood would have been great friends I think.  Anyway, the director of this doc (Michael Stephenson) played the part of the young son in the 1987 T2.  He does a good job, showing not only the fervor of the fans but the ultimate sadness for some of the actors and people invested in the film.  A rocket to stardom it was not.",1325116800,,1027,4.157360406091371
4215143,4,B003X3BYHE,"This is a really well made documentary looking at the phenomenon of Troll 2, the miserable piece of dreck that cast the director of this film as the boy who must keep his family from eating any goblin food. He gets his one-time cast mates together to talk to each other and to fans, visits some of them at home, and visits fan viewings. The film takes a left turn when the Italian husband-and-wife writer/director team comes. The wife seems to understand, but the director is not in on the joke.",1317513600,,495,4.450549450549451
4215144,5,B003X3BYHE,"I remember the movie Troll 2 in spurts, seeing it as a child kind of makes it hazy. I decided to go back and re-watch it on Netflix with a few friends the other night, and it was glorious. So goofy and fun, yet serious in a way. But mostly funny because it's really that bad. Mind you there are many Goblins in the film, but not one Troll to be seen..

Back to back we decided to watch the ""Best Worst Movie"" Documentary. The young boy and father from the Troll 2 film, which had nothing to do at all with Troll 1 by the way, are the main people from this documentary. The documentary shows how Troll 2 has always held a very fun place in people's hearts and has made a semi come back with showings in movie houses or even just large parties of people getting together to enjoy the film in their basements.

It also delves deeper into the personal lives of the actors in the movie, some who have what I would say are a few issues and really tug on your heart strings in ways. While others just embrace the goofiness and fun of being in the best/worst movie of all time and being quasi famous for it =).

I would recommend watching Troll 2 fairly recently to seeing this documentary just so you remember the actors and certain parts of the movie. The cast is great and really has fun going back into the past and explaining what being in the film means to them at this point in their lives. The director of Troll 2 at first seemed to have a good time during the documentary but eventually started to get frustrated with the actors pokes of fun at the film and the way they were directed. He seemed a little sensitive when concerning his jibes at his Italian/broken English directing abilities.

I would definitely recommend this Documentary to Troll 2 fans, Horror movie buffs, and even just people who like documentaries in general. It's a fun romp with some sad and very insightful moments with emotion. I'm glad to see the fans enjoy this film so dearly, and the actors hold their heads high for the most part, for being a part of such a awful yet amusing movie.

Grade: B+, because ""You can't piss on hospitality! I won't allow it!""",1315526400,5,2135,4.314214463840399

4215146,5,B003X3BYHE,"If you are a movie lover who watches movies over and over again. Or if you love documentaries. Or if you love B movies. Or if you love horror movies.

You need this DVD!

It will be the best $10 you ever spend! It's one of those addictive movies that you watch everyday like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" or ""In the Mouth of Madness"" or ""The Ninth Gate"".

Such an improbability what is presented at the beginning of the movie and where the movie goes after that! A Southern dentist, very handsome and charming, has a nice car, nice house, beautiful ex-wife and daughter. The whole town loves him. Just a picture perfect setting.

And then it turns out he starred in this horrible movie, Troll 2. I know! I know! Lots of people love that movie. But, I did watch Troll 2 on Netflix instant play and it was too realistic for me! I'm always worried about poisoned food. And the food in Troll 2 is unbelievably gross looking. And I'm a pescoterian, so that Italian writer would hate me! The whole reason she wrote Troll 2 was she thought her vegetarian friends were hypocrites. ??? lol. I don't understand why...I think it's a great lifestyle. I've been this way for at least eight years...

Anywho! This Southern dentist and the director of Best Worst Movie, the child star of Troll 2, make the documentary worth watching! The real horror in Troll 2 is the actors' coming to terms with making that movie 21 years ago! Which makes Best Worst Movie awesome! Their reactions, and of course the cult fans it has finally gained after all this time, their completely opposite reaction to the movie, undying love and praise, is such a dichotomy. Which is awesome! And I totally appreciate that guy getting the Troll 2 tattoo. I've gotten tattoos of things I love (different aspects of my music and cats). I feel you bro!

The funny part is you don't have to really even see Troll 2, since Best Worst Movie has all the best clips of Troll 2 in the documentary. But, yeah, watch Best Worst Movie, then Troll 2, then watch Best Worst Movie again. And you will understand the ""horror"": the horror that a movie such as Troll 2 was ever made!

I love Italian horror movies, especially Dario Argento. And I agree that the filmmakers of Troll 2 knew how to make a good movie, you can tell with how the film is paced and written. It's just that Troll 2, is not a good movie. But, I can totally understand fan obsession with movies and their want/need/joy in watching them over and over. I do that myself. So, I really connected with the Troll 2 fans. They're all awesome. I just watched Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf last night for the 25th time!!!

Also: anyone notice Shandi from America's Next Top Model Season 2 getting her shirt signed at the New York Troll 2 premiere? That has got to be her! Tall and skinny with glasses and still looking fabulous, just now with lots of cool tattoos!

Hail Michael Stephenson! My new favorite director!!! I love this movie!!! Best Worst Movie is part of my all time top five, for sure.",1302134400,2,3011,4.469945355191257
4215147,4,B003X3BYHE,"Michael Paul Stephenson's ""Best Worst Movie"" is a very good and entertaining documentary about the making of a very bad and entertaining horror movie. While I'm not sure that ""Troll 2"" deserves the title of Best Worst Movie--that, in my opinion, will always belong to ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""--there's no question that ""Troll 2"" is goofily, lunkheadedly, compulsively watchable. ""Troll 2"" is the movie on which Stephenson's dreams of child stardom were dashed, so it's only natural that, 20 years later, he would want to explore the film's rise to cult status, get back in touch with his director and co-stars, and revisit the macabre environs of Nilbog.

Stephenson (who as an adult looks like Ken Burns' scruffy kid brother) concentrates on George Hardy, the likable Alabama dentist who just happened to be living in Utah that fateful day in 1992 when director Claudio Fragasso sent out a casting call. Hardy played Stephenson's father, in one of the most unforgettably wooden performances of all time. Hordes of loyal fans treat Hardy and Stephenson like royalty as they attend countless midnight screenings of ""Troll 2."" Everywhere he goes, Hardy is forced to repeat his signature line from the movie: ""You don't (expletive deleted) on hospitality! I won't allow it!""

Hardy and Stephenson go in search of their co-stars. Mostly the reunions are happy, but there is sadness in the scenes with the elderly Robert Ormsby, who played Stephenson's grandfather, musing about how he ""frittered away"" his life. There is something very close to tragedy in the scenes with Margo Prey, who played Stephenson's mother, and who has become an emotionally fragile recluse. (Toward the end of ""Best Worst Movie,"" Prey does something that is infinitely more frightening than anything in ""Troll 2."" I will leave you to discover it for yourself.)

Meanwhile, Claudio Fragasso wanders through ""Best Worst Movie,"" gruffly insisting on the enduring importance of ""Troll 2"" and heckling the ""Troll 2"" actors at fan conventions. ""You know absolutely nothing! You are all dogs!"" he shouts at the actors in a nearly impenetrable Italian accent. (All the actors agree that Fragasso's English is much better now than at the time ""Troll 2"" was made.) For all his stubbornness, Fragasso radiates an integrity and a redeeming sense of humor that make him far more likable than not.

If you've seen ""Troll 2."" I can't imagine your not wanting to see ""Best Worst Movie."" If you haven't seen ""Troll 2,"" ""Best Worst Movie"" will make you want to see it immediately. Be sure to watch the extras on the DVD, which contain interviews with cast members who appear only in passing in the main documentary. I was particularly happy to see the interview with Deborah Reed, who for my money gives the ""Best Worst Performance"" of all time as Creedence Leonore Gielgud, the snarling, purring leader of ""Troll 2's"" goblins.",1301356800,3,2882,5.010438413361169

This wonderful celebration of ineptitude was directed by the once-disgraced troll-playing child star Michael Paul Stephenson.",1299801600,,526,5.5375
4215167,5,B003X3BYHE,"20 years ago a motion picture was filmed by two Italian filmmakers who hired Utah actors such as Robert Ornsby, George Hardy, Michael Paul Stephenson, Jason Steadman, Paul and Patrick Gibbs, Margo Prey, Don Packard, Connie Young and others were filming what use to be the number one worst film of all time according to the IMDB and by critics including other people on what they unleashed. They were ashamed and not proud of what they did but 18 years later thanks to VHS rentals and HBO showings of the film known only as ""Troll 2"" has became known as the greatest bad movie of all time spawning a Rocky Horror Picture Show-esque legion of fans in every city and country.

This brilliant documentary is produced and directed by Michael Paul Stephenson who was once a child actor that didn't want to remember the hilarious disaster known as ""Troll 2"" as he gives us an odyssey on what happened to the actors including the life of one-time actor turned Alabama Dentist known as George Hardy and the rest as they discovered what a phenomenon the film is despite being critically panned. It's a smart, hilarious and entertaining look of how a bad movie can change the life of some people. One of the best documentaries on a movie i have ever seen and a must have for those that enjoy b-movies and cult films including well put together documentaries.

4215170,5,B003X3BYHE,"Recommended: Watch Troll 2, especially with friends who haven't seen it before, than watch Best Worst Movie.

On its own, Troll 2 is one of those special movies that walks the line between amateurishness and watchability. There are few movies that poorly acted (with the possible exception of the director of this documentary), horribly scripted, and full of gaping plot holes (notably the fact that there are no trolls in it) that you can't stop watching and enjoy so much.

Then, to add to the canon of Troll 2, such a lovingly rendered, well directed, well edited, and well told documentary is something no trashy movie that I can think of has ever been bestowed with. Even with American Movie (the closest comparison I can think of to Best Worst Movie), you really don't want to watch the original. It is absolutely as essential as Troll 2.

What's admirable is the way Michael Stephenson focuses on actor George Hardy's narcissism and quest for attention and director Claudio Fragasso's firm belief that Troll 2 is a serious masterpiece dealing with real issues without ever judging them. (Best moment: When Fragrasso dismisses an audience member as an idiot for asking why there are no trolls in Troll 2.) And even more impressive is how Stephenson takes a backseat to his fellow cast members: the movie definitely leaves you wanting to know more about him (a good thing) and the poor, mentally unbalanced woman who plays his mom.

Just like Troll 2, Worst Movie Ever is a classic--not a thing should be changed. The only difference is that in this case, it's intentional.",1296345600,,1578,4.833333333333333

The odds that such a truly absurd and lovable group of characters could come together to act in and produce Troll 2--the ""best worst movie"" that this documentary is about--are a trillion to one.

I found the parts with the mom sad tho, seems things handt panned out so well for her and I really feel for her, but I will say she looked very well, better than she did 20 years ago haha.  My only disappointment was not seeing Deborah Reed in the movie, sure her role wasn't all that large but it was an important role, and I thought she was just hot in the movie, even with the less than perfect teeth lol (except for the herpes lips of course) and of course Im not just talking about when she used her magic for the scene in the RV, Ive got a thing for creepy pale chicks.
