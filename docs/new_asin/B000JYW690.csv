8153577,2,B000JYW690,"Sudharani Raghupathy's team just started their journey into the commercial DVD production, and made the viewers dizzy with the 3 camera cuts changing each other very clumsily. The cameramen thought they were making a pop music video hit, and they mostly shot from the ceiling. Except for T.M. Sridevi, all other dancers can be better employed as scarecrows. By the way, on jayqworld there are online video fragments from this DVD, in case you want to preview it, and the details of the contents. In this DVD, I liked the fragment where Kitappa Pillai was watching the early Sudharani's students in Thanjavur. It is a pity that the best of Sudharani's dancers have grown out of shape, and she does not have anyone else as good as T.M. Sridevi. All in all, Sudharani Raghupathy's concept of this DVD is quite scholarly. And the Dolby audio is superb.",1179532800,,848,4.775510204081633
