7833502,5,630299604X,"Yes.  It looks like this DVD may be out of print (thus the high markup).  It's worth looking for at your local library, but certainly a DVD to add to your collection if you are serious.  It's a quicker, less intimate synopsis compared to the PBS documentary...  With more of an emphasis, I feel, on Andy as an artist, than on his ""life"".

This DVD helped me to get a better understanding of Andy's process as a professional.  It gives some better insights as to the crucial transformations he was going through from about 1964-1970.

Andy was in his 30's, successful, moneyed, and still in the process of finding himself.  He was a chameleon; perhaps with good reason, because people who were openly gay were ostracized.  Andy kept a lid on it.  (After all, he was still living with his mother, who was in complete denial.) He learned how to hide behind his paintings, his clothing, his glasses and wigs.  He changed his associations, mostly aligning himself with homosexual and transsexual personalities who he used in his films.  He didn't exactly make friends with them so much as he allowed himself to live ""through"" them by use of his camera, and film.

As someone mentioned very briefly in this DVD, Andy was aware that there was a dark side to pop-culture.  With his focus on sex and death, Andy was exploring the nature of impermanence in these projects.  As a result, he managed to peeve off more than a few individuals!

7833503,4,630299604X,"While some reviewers have called this ""creepy"" --you have to remember who we are dealing with here. I thought this was very representative of Andy and his ups and downs that are reflected in his bodies of work.  Some of it isn't pretty, but it's real. This touches on a side that isn't that pop-ready persona--but a more intimate, raw, exposed look.",1202169600,6,349,4.629032258064516
7833504,4,630299604X,"This documentary presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is very detailed, competent, and comprehensive. It includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional work analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good.

7833505,5,630299604X,"This is A great documentary film on the life of pop artist Andy Warhol. It goes from his very humble beginnings to king of the pop art world.

7833506,4,630299604X,"this videotape runs 79 minutes. it was part of the London Weekend Television ""South Bank Show"".

my local library had it sitting on their shelf.

this is a good basic documentary introduction to the life of Andy Warhol(originally Warhola).

for a complete, full-blown documentary,the PBS produced ""Andy Warhol-A Documentary Film"" which came out in 2006 is the thing to get.

but, as i say, this little videotape will serve as a good foundation.

some of the highlights for me with this video is a glimpse of his film ""Kitchen"", about 30 seconds long.

another, from ""Chelsea Girls"", the ""Pope Ondine"" segment, Ondine slapping a girl around like a brat. she warns him in a gently stern voice ""don't touch me"" and he WACKS her again! i wish she went balistic on him!

an interview with brigid berlin shows her mocking her mother's horror after just coming from seeing her 'bohemian' daughter in ""Chelsea Girls"".

there are plenty of newsreals of Andy being interviewed

and Andy is always true to form, that is, squirling his way around every question, ducking, dodging, mimicking the interviewer, very reluctant to give a serious answer.

but so entertaining!

there are good discussions about his art, how it evolved, the public's and critic's reactions to it..his own 'thoughts' about it.",1172188800,5,1289,4.9766355140186915
7833507,2,630299604X,"This DVD is reminiscent of those awful grade-school filmstrips millions of us endured in the 60s. (And I'm assuming the 50s and 70s, too!)

Here's a sample of the narration (I might not get it exact, as I watched the DVD a week ago):

""Marilyn, Number 3. 1963. Marilyn, Number 5. 1963. Liz, Number 7. 1959. Marilyn, Number 2. 1961. Elvis, Number 4. 1966.""

And so on, and so on, and so on.

The only thing missing was the interminable ""beep"" that alerted a bored kid on the AV squad to advance the filmstrip to the next frame.

Several points:

Warhol died in 1987. Not in 1798. There IS some actual film footage of the man, that given the DVD format, COULD have been used.

He led a rather interesting life. More than a few minutes could have been spent discussing it, and rather than showing still images of artwork he had created, I would rather have seen more photographs of him and his family.

While he was known for producing multiple versions of the same artwork, perhaps a little more effort could have been made in showing the evolution from one image to the next. (Like a smooth cross-fade from one image to the next.) I didn't understand the point of showing 3 Marilyns, then 2 of Liz, then an Elvis, then back to Marilyn, and so on, ad nauseum.

All in all, the only reason I'm going 2 stars on this, is the fact that I thought he was a uniquely interesting character and I can't bring myself to hang a 1-star review on anything associated with him!",1099180800,18,1462,4.385185185185185
7833508,3,630299604X,"If I had to choose between a DVD of a real movie called ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" or this DVD which shows samples of his artwork with an emphasis on death and his religious side, my choice would be learning about Andy's crazy world by watching the real movie or by listening to a CD called Songs for Drella which is mainly songs by Lou Reed.  As an activity, art has less interest for me than practically everything else about Andy Warhol, who was a celebrity that might even be considered a scapegoat for people who read too many articles in The New York Times using him as a prime example of something weird going on in American society.

I watched this DVD a few times, and it did get better as I got used to constant references to skulls, a suicide, death, religion and endless praise, but the last time, I noticed that the other artist Andy allowed to do the extra doodling on the ten boxing punching bags that Andy had decorated with pictures of Christ from the famous Last Supper painting had written `Judge  Judge  Judge' on one or more of the bags.  If people actually punch these bags, that might mess up the paint, wouldn't it?  I would hate to have anyone tell me that I was confused by my reactions to this, but looking at these exhibits on a DVD does not give the average viewer much opportunity to do anything much worse than whatever it shows.

Andy died in 1987, a few years older than I am now and much more successful, but I think I made a more comic portrait of Chairman Mao by adding floppy arms and a bunch of bananas, as if when Mao was blamed for what happened in Nam, American politicians seemed to think:  If at first you don't succeed, get a bigger bunch of bananas.  We sent 500,000 American bananas at a time to Asia in the years 1967, 1968, and a bit of 1969, before Nixon made the big announcement about the 250,000 churches, pagodas, and temples that the Marines were building `This year alone . . .'  (Press Conference, December 8, 1969).

There aren't many women shown on this DVD, just the usual Jackie, Marilyn, and Liz portraits, and a portrait of Andy's mother, but the DVD does explain how openly gay some of Andy's tender drawings were.  The flock of birds forming a star for Christmas cards might still seem inspirational to some people.  One of the `Andy Warhol' signatures shown was done by his mother on the front of the card.  The art which was chosen for the funeral program is explained well enough in the middle of the DVD so that is not as surprising at the end as it was the first time.  Is it too late to get one of those punching bags?",1091923200,4,2582,4.327800829875518
