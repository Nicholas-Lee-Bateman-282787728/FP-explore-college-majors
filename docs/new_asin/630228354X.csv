Let's just say that I identify with Rose.  There were times in my past when I was treated just as cruelly as she was, but no one ever made it up to me the way that Eddie made it up to her.  And the fact that they fell in love made it that much sweeter.
When I first saw this movie, I made it my mission to tell everyone about it.  I subjected all of my friends to multiple showings. It is still to this day my favorite movie of all time.

However, if you didn't understand why there might be super fans of River Phoenix...This is the film one must see. I will not spend time going deep into the plot; however, if you've watched nearly every ""teen film"" ~ but missed viewing the angry teens, the confused teens, the hopeful teens, and the painfully, awkwardly, real teens.

You'll find them here.

Also, you will find moments of the Beat Generation. Before, during, and even after VietnamThese moments, though painful and hard to define, are crucial in this coming-of-age-story.

River Phoenix and Lily Taylor make it work--and inadvertently set the stage for what Derek Klena and Lindsay Mendez would do twenty years later. Overall, the film seemed rather straight-to-the-point, and could have used a little more build-up between key moments. But hey, what else can you do, and how else can you do it, on the night before you're shipped off to war? This picture was honest about that: first date on what could be your only night together.

The most ugly girl wins the competion). Birdlace finds he likes Rose and tries to talk her out of attending the party. But she wants to go.

When Rose finds out the real reasons for why Birdlace showed interest in her. She slaps him around the face and lays into him by telling him exactly what she thinks of him. He managers to make it up to her and they decide to go on a real date. He begins to really like her. She manages to change him for the better. By being a better mannered person. They have a really short relationship until he has to return to the war the next day. I won't give away the ending.

448188,5,630228354X,"This movie is a rare, unspoken about jem. I do not know why more people do not know about River Phoenix's best movie ever. Director Nancy Savoca is on her most amazing game here. I mean, granted, she had the legendary acting that only River Phoenix could deliver- hell, if he were still alive today, there would be no Brad Pitt or Leo- I mean, River was the most genius and gifted actor of our time (gen X) . Written by Bob Comfort- the story of a bunch of marines during Vietnam era coming into town for the night and making a bet about who could bring the ugliest girl to a party- but not telling the girls why they were asked- is sickening, humiliating and uncomfortable- but the way it was shot and directed- amazing! And what happens after that is magic....Lili Taylor is amazing in her role as Rose. Very convincing. I love how the director Nancy Savoca lets the camera linger on River's facial expressions during a lot of the movie- I love the sophisticated charm and wit of this movie. I still quote lines from it with my sister. It is one of those movies that you just cannot forget. Or erase out of your mind, even though when it first came out I think I was like 16 years old and now I am 40. I watched it a million times. River died about five years after this movie was made...seriously poignant, deep, rich, moving and an ending that is nothing short of genius. Def one of my top 10 movies of all time. Man, I miss River Phoenix. There was no one like him.",1428710400,7,1470,4.253571428571429
448189,5,630228354X,"I initially bought this film because I adored the musical Dogfight, which was based on this film. River Phoenix and Lili Taylor are both charming in this film, in a way that feels distinctly different from the musical, and they are that much more endearing and real because of the stop-and-start, push-and-pull of their interactions. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would reccomend it to anyone who would like an unconventional romance with a lot of heart. And for those of you who enjoy Broadway and off-Broadway, the musical they created off of this film is an outstanding score.",1427155200,2,583,4.898989898989899

448222,5,630228354X,"So sweet and understated, yet so poignant and powerful. This is such a rare gem of a film, with two young lead actors working near the very top of their game. Seeing it again always reminds me why I find Lili Taylor to be one of the most authentic, soulful, beautiful, talented actresses working today ... and River Phoenix, just seeing him play completely against type in this role reminds me of the amazing gifts he could have shared with the world had he lived. But both actors breathe such life into this movie, which I could watch over and over. It's a deceptively simple, quiet study of people finding themselves as they find each other; of emerging ideals and the lost innocence of an entire nation. It's absolutely filled with tiny, understated (sometimes very funny) moments of observation and insight, communicated by an awkward pause or the look on a character's face. And I am constantly mystified by reviewers who ask whether the final scene felt ""tacked on."" Those last five minutes, in which virtually nothing is said, communicate nearly everything the movie sets out to convey. Such brokenness and silent resignation, speaking such volumes of hope.",1409184000,3,1164,4.883838383838384

448246,5,630228354X,"One of the best little movies about the 1960s. Slice of life of regular people in San Fransisco the day before JFK is killed. Oh, yes, it happens to be the day Phoenix's Birdlace is shipping out to Vietnam as well. And there is the Dogfight dance that is kind of funny and cruel at the same time, but it is really about how one finds real love when and where they are not looking. Told in one long flashback and several shorter others, the current action is Birdlace returning to San Fransisco to find Rose right where he left her after years in Nam. No political stance hitting you over the head here, no war heroes, just people loving, losing and trying to survive the Dogfight that is life. Reminded me how young the men in Vietnam actually were--Children really.  Lots of swearing, no nudity, war violence for about 3 minutes, but mostly a good movie to show youngsters what the 1960s looked like. My 14 year old cried. This Dogfight is worth your time.",1401408000,4,957,4.4375

448253,5,630228354X,I will not spend time going over the story line for this film which has already been covered by previous reviews - what i will say is that it is - in the end - a tender love story that truly conveys something very simple but universally true - how we all want to be loved and how just how fortunate we should feel if we find that truly special connection with another human being - even if it is for just an evening - and even if it is with someone you never would have imagined you would be interested in let alone attracted to.  I wouldn't say that I had any opinion of River Phoenix before seeing this film - however seeing this actor so flawlessly and subtly present the viewer with this initally unlikable character (albeit very handsome character) and peel away layer by layer the actual decent person who was beneath the bravado is a testament to his raw talent - you should remember after you finish watching this remarkable film that he was only 21 at the time of doing this role - when you actually see the tiny touches and emotion that he manages to convey it's quite breathtaking - and something that other 'actors' can't achieve even after an entire acting career.  As for Lily Taylor - she also oozes raw talent and she is so alive before the camera.  She plays a character that is not an easy one to pull off - but at the end of the film you admire the character of Rose tremendously - she really does bloom by the end of the film - but without having changed anything about herself - more by revealing in more entirety the essence of her character - which is truly beautiful.  What director Nancy Savoca has achieved with this film is so commendable - she notes in her directors commentary that  the crew and actors affectionately referred to this film during filming as a 'little film' - even though they knew it was anything but - and I totally agree....................90 minutes of your life that is well spent.,1389052800,,1931,4.38268156424581
448274,5,630228354X,"A beautiful film about following your heart to its true home. Four marines, too immature to form relationships, too insecure to attempt to attract the kind of picture prefect women they fantasize about, hold a contest to see who can find the ugliest date. Birdlace [ River Phoenix] convinces shy, plump Rose to go with him after meeting her in her mother's cafe. However, along the way, he sees her true beauty, strength, integrity and intelligence shining through her supposedly plain exterior. The two spend an enchanted evening together, contrasted to the buddies who do some typically macho things. Birdlace ships to Viet Nam the next day, and under the influence of his buddies, denies his true heart. I won't give away what happens next other than to say it is deeply touching.

The two principles are marvelous and the supporting cast very good.

448282,3,630228354X,"but the movie has three problems that prevent me from giving anything better.

""Dogfight"" has to be unique among the many romantic comedies and romances in that the ""meet cute"" is that the male lead (River Phoenix playing a young Marine named Eddie about to ship out to Vietnam) meets the female lead (named Rose who works at a coffee shop and is played by the peerless Lili Taylor) when he finds himself stuck for a ""date"" for a ""dogfight"" that he and his friends are putting on.

<spoilers>

A ""dogfight"" is an extraordinarily insensitive and misogynistic little game where guys compete to see who can get the ugliest date.  The winner gets the money the entrants put together. I actually knew someone in college who took part in one of these, and I remember thinking that he was a real loser.

Eddie chooses Rose to be his entry in this contest, and she eventually catches on to what he's done and gives him a piece of her mind and storms off into the night.

But Eddie feels remorse for what he subjected Rose to, and he also realizes that he actually likes her and after a comically botched apology back at her house, the two go out on the town and have a whirlwind romance.

That's it except for the bittersweet coda where Eddie returns home from Vietnam broken by his wounds and loss of his friends and falls weeping into Rose's welcoming arms.

<spoilers end>

Like I said this movie has three flaws that undermine it:

1.  The film asks us to believe Rose is an unattractive woman because she is fat.  The thing is, Lili Taylor is not a fat person and the ""fat suit"" she wears in the movie is really obvious.  They should have come up with some other stratagem to make her look dowdy because she looks faintly ridiculous in that get up.

2.  Eddie is presented as a ""good guy"" once he realizes he likes Rose.  But when he was apologizing to her, he happened to comment that he had taken part in six other dogfights before meeting her.  Taking repeated part in such events goes beyond being just a little immature and insensitive, and I think that an admission like that would hardly make Rose think to herself, ""Yup, he's a keeper!!""

3.  Finally, the film takes willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point and beyond in that it shows Rose going from justifiably furious at Eddie and his pals for treating women so badly to being ""in love"" with him to the point of sleeping with him ... all in the span of just a few hours (and this was fifty years ago when people even in San Francisco were a lot less casual about sex).  I could have bought the idea of them reconciling and falling in love over a week or even a few days, but the idea that they would have become lovers so quickly after such a disastrous introduction was absurd.  And what would it say about a woman who had so little self esteem that she'd be willing to sleep with the guy who she felt humiliated her and a lot of other women just a few hours after the dogfight took place?

My criticisms shouldn't be taken as a warning not to see the movie.  Lili Taylor is wonderful in the film, and Phoenix showed he was a talented actor and his death is a loss for the cinema.  It's just that it asked a little too much of me to give it four or five stars.",1365552000,3,3233,4.323383084577115

448305,5,630228354X,"River Phoenix was arguably one of the greatest young actors of the late 80's, early 90's. His untimely death ended a career that would have blossomed even more over time.

In Dogfight, Phoenix play the part of Birdlace with honesty and emotion. You think of the character as a complete jerk to begin with, then realize that the marine does have a soft heart for ugly-duckling Rose. You're then again disappointed when he rips up her address and tosses out the window of a moving bus as he and his fellow marines head to Viet Nam. For those who haven't seen it, I won't reveal the final scene. Instead, I will say that it is truly touching. Both Phoenix and Taylor delve into the characters of Birdlace and Rose, a perfect pair for this film. Their quiet moments together had me feeling the intensity, something that I admire. Not every actor is able to do that.

I feel like this film should have received more recognition when it was released. Then again, Phoenix wasn't about recognition and was more about doing films he believed in. Fans of this movie saw the same special qualities that River saw; the development of the characters made you care for them even when they were in the wrong and the story was so bittersweet and realistic that you could have seen something like that actually happening during that confusing and delicate time in history.

For some, River will always be missed and we will always wonder what might have been. Definitely give this one a viewing if you like romance flicks!",1359072000,,1505,4.629213483146067

River Phoenix is good in this, but really this is Lili Taylor's film. Her character goes through a lot of emotions in this film & they are all superbly acted.

448310,5,630228354X,"I recently rewatched this film from the early 90's and appreciated it even more the second time around. Set in the mid 60s, it begins with a story about four young marines who have leave in San Francisco before being sent to Vietnam. While celebrating a night on the town they decide to have a DOGFIGHT while on leave. The rules of the DOGFIGHT were simple: everyone puts in fifty bucks and the guy with the ugliest date wins. River Phoenix stars as Cpl. Eddie (Devil Dog) Birdlace and he finds a young, shy waitress in a small cafe named Rose, played by Lili Taylor, for his date. She loves folk music but is naive when it comes to dating and men. After Rose abruptly leaves after finding out the truth about the DOGFIGHT Eddie runs after her, leaving his friends behind to spend a long evening together with her. They slowly learn about each other and escape the lonliness of their lives, at least for this one night. They both give outstanding performances and the acting along with the heartwarming story and the incredible sound of 60's folk/rock music makes this film a unique and captivating love story. San Francisco in the 60's is a dynamic character of its own, adding another creative dimension to this genuine story of falling in love during a time of immense change in the world.",1351641600,,1292,4.573275862068965
448311,5,630228354X,"This was a wonderful surprise for me.  The premise sounded a little cheesy as if it could easily become something campy and forgettable.  Instead, director Nancy Savoca uses such intimate depth and fragility to unearth the inner emotions at play and truly craft a believable bond and ignited (however softly) love between two very unlikely people.

The film takes place is 1963.  Eddie Birdlace and his friends are preparing to get shipped off for Vietnam and are planning on taking part in a nasty little game called `Dogfight'.  Basically, men have to find and unsuspecting date to bring to a party where they will be graded on their looks and the man who brings the ugliest date gets a cash prize.  Eddie finds young Rose, a frumpy waitress who has an overbearing (or is she merely concerned) mother.  Rose is nave and sensitive and reserved and somewhat unattractive and so Eddie lays on the charm (or what he can muster) and gets her come with him.  Once she discovers what she is there for, the tables turn and the relationship between Rose and Eddie takes an unexpected turn.

It's truly remarkable and beautiful to watch.

This is thanks in large part to the three main players here.  Savoca's direction is so sincere, so intimate that one cannot help but be completely taken by the way she frames her characters and their situations.  The cinematography is also beautifully complimentary to the emotional themes.  Savoca works wonders with her leads as well.  River Phoenix, who was having such a great year in '91, is on the very top of his game.  He embodies Eddie with an inner struggle and adds layers of depth to him especially as the film progresses forward.  But it is Lili Taylor who steals the show and your heart.  The way her character shifts from shy and nave to convicted and aggressive is astonishing.  She never loses the insecurity that laces her every movement, but she underlines her actions with a ferocity that is unforgettable.

If you are looking for a small, quiet, breathtaking departure from the frothy predictable `love stories' of the norm, then dig in to `Dogfight'; you'll be more than pleased.",1340236800,,2132,4.775956284153006

448341,5,630228354X,"I watched this movie for the second time yesterday when I saw it playing on the Indieplex channel. The first time was in 1992 or thereabouts when one of my parents rented the VHS. I was 12 at the time, and even at that age it resonated with me so much that when I saw it on TV I squealed ""Ohmygoddogfight!"" and quickly turned it on.

From start to finish this movie pulls you in and makes you feel for Rose and Eddie. The sweetness of their romance unfolds so realistically and so well that you forget you're watching a movie. The is due in large part to River's and Lili's stellar performances. There are so many times in other films when it's hard to see past the actor to the character they're portraying, but this is not one of those times. The sheer awkwardness of so many of their moments together; the reserved awe Rose feels at having Eddie beside her, mixed with her refusal to be a doormat; Eddie's constant visible disbelief at his growing feelings for a girl he originally picked as his date for the dogfight--the tone of this movie is so intimate that you are able to acknowledge and feel these emotions right along with the characters. This is not a cookie-cutter Hollywood romance in any way. Any man or woman could probably find something in the characters or story to identify with, which is where I think the real brilliance lies. It's just so REAL. Their time together is far from perfect, and yet it leaves a mark that lasts through a war and years with no contact between them. I think that is a perfect allegory for the film itself - sure, it has flaws, but once it was over I couldn't think of a single one. The feeling that lasted was something deeper and harder to define - just like Eddie and Rose's relationship.

Last but not least, the ending--I can definitely see how it's a love-or-hate-it kind of thing, although most of the film's fans tend to appreciate it. At first I thought it was a bit abrupt, but once I'd had time to digest what was going on, I appreciated it more and more. Words are never enough to really describe our emotions or the way we feel about those we love, and I think it would have brought the movie down to try and express the depth of what both characters were probably feeling at the time. I thought it was the perfect end to an unforgettable movie.",1281744000,,2306,4.372960372960373

448388,4,630228354X,"Wow!  I love the setting, the research, the growth, the story told in this movie.  You see Birdlace, a Marine, choose Rose as his date for the dogfight.  The Marines are shipping out to Vietnam the next day so they are letting loose.  Birdlace half heartedly tries to dissuade Rose from sticking it out but Rose will have none of that!  When Rose finds out what the party really is, she lets Birdlace have it (you learn in the audio commentary that the particular scene I'm talking about was their FIRST take).  Birdlace asks for Rose's forgiveness and the bulk of the movie takes you through his last night in the States with Rose.  Spanning from the 60s to the 70s, we also see how the culture has changed.  Contrasted with the rigid 60s, Birdlace comes back to a 70s America where a lot has changed.  You'll either love the ending or not.  I suggest if you have a hard time swallowing the ending, listen to the audio commentary!  This DVD has the type of audio commentary I love.  The director talks about the motives, the 'symbolism', and the research, and the quirky little facts. The director and the producer talk about what is really going on ... what the characters might be thinking.  I would give the commentary itself a 5/5 stars!

More things I liked:
- the awkward love scenes.  Instead of cutting and fast forwarding to the 'good' stuff, she (the director) makes you go through every painful moment of it.
- The transformation of River Phoenix's Birdlace character throughout the movie.  He is your typical cussing sailor who turns into this quiet, stoic type by the end.
- Rose's character.  Even though she is the victim of this dogfight, she never acts pitiful but still plays this hopeful, fragile, naive character.
- Birdlace's military friends.  They are these minor characters, but they still are independent round characters with personality and thought put into their story lines.
- In the audio commentary, the director notes that Birdlace represents the harsh reality of things and Rose is the idealistic hopeful one.  Even though they have these opposite viewpoints, you believe them both.  So true.  The commentary also notes the dress Rose wears to the dogfight (which, when she gets prepared for it is one of my favorite parts of the movie) is this puffy, yellow thing where Rose looks almost like a fluffy duckling and she's going into this dogfight where the guys have different intentions ... These are the types of things you learn in the commentary!  Very informative.

448391,5,630228354X,"Dog Fight is a charming little movie, surprisingly sensitive for such an ugly subject. Eddie Birdlace (River Phoenix) is a young marine who will soon be shipping out to Viet Nam. A marine tradition is to have a dog fight, a contest to see who can get the ugliest girl to come to a party. Eddie asks Rose (Lili Taylor) but then regrets it when he starts to like her. While in the Ladies Room she overhears that she is in a dog fight, and tells him off, trying to salvage what little dignity remains. He follows her home, and in spite of getting off on the wrong foot, convinces her to go out with him. He is a young and callow jerk, but she refuses to be mistreated. There is a funny scene in a restaurant where she gives as good as she gets to drive home her point that he swears too much. Can't print the quote, but you get the idea.

The movie takes place in 1963, and the two characters mirror the schism that was tearing our country apart. She is much more politically aware, if perhaps a bit too idealistic and naive. She is listening to Joan Baez and such.

I just read up on River Phoenix, and he was a remarkable man. He died tragically of a drug overdose outside Johnny Depp's Viper Room on Sunset Blvd. He was brought up by an unusual family who belonged to a religious cult, but perhaps could better be described as hippies. River had numerous friends who were really shaken by his death. They are actors and directors, and many musicians from all over the world. I mention this merely because to see him in Dog Fight, he really becomes a young gung ho marine with little idea of what Viet Nam has in store for him.

Lili Taylor has carved out quite a career for herself playing the kind of deep, brooding artists that may not be the cutest but are certainly the most profound girls in the room. She is married to a poet, Nicky Flynn, who navigates between the worlds of theater and poetry effortlessly. He seems perfect for her, and I wish them both much happiness.

We watched and my mom became so intrigued.  She smiled and laughed, she thought the awkward kiss was awkward and charming.  When Eddie comes back from Vietnam she comments on how different he looks and at the end with that heartbreaking hug she just stared. After the movie she said that this movie was very nice and not what she thought.

Eddie (River Phoenix) is a marine about to be shipped off to Vietnam, he's naive in his own way, he curses every other word and thinks that he is ready for what's to come.  Him and his buddies stage a dogfight and have to find an ugly date to take and see if they win.  Eddie isn't having luck and stumbles into a cafe and spots Rose (Lili Taylor).  He charms and b.s's her to come along. The dogfight begins and Eddie has second thoughts about the whole thing.  Rose finds out about the dogfight and Eddie tries to redeem himself by taking her out.  What ensues is awkward yet charming  and lovely to watch.  He comes back a torn soldier, using guns to try and solve problems, which leads you back to think of the conversation they had that one night. The ending is bittersweet, makes you want to cry and smile.  No words were necessary for this scene although you almost wish there were.  The painful look in Eddie's eyes and the understanding look in Roses' is enough.

This movie needs to be re-released because it didn't get the credit it deserved what so ever.  The acting, even with the smaller characters, was top notch and both River and Lili gave so much dimension to the people they were playing. I love the naiveness of Rose's character, she is so aware but still so naive and hopeful.

All the movies i watched with River he always blew my mind at the potential. I believed he was those people, it's very rare for an actor to be able to play so many different types of characters without people comparing them.  You forgot about him being River Phoenix you just thought of his character on screen.

I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a chick type of movie but I believe any guy would enjoy this as well due to the crude humor and such.",1203811200,,2517,4.314893617021276

The story is about the two main characters, Eddie and his ugly date---Rose, on the last night before he and his buddies ship out to Viet Nam. I don't know how they were able to make this movie so touching, so human and so funny when the subject matter, on the surface, is so offensive.  The scenes with Eddie's three best buddies are filled with youthful male humor---vulgar, crude and immature--- yet it rings so true and really is just plain hilarious.  You love these guys.  They don't know where they're going when they ship out, but they're together and nothing else matters.  And the friendship that develops between Eddie and Rose also rings completely true.

I like the way the ""ugly"" girl turns out to be so witty and interesting and how the cute guy, over the course of the night, is so affected by her.  The whole movie is just a wonderful surprise.  From beginning to end.  I still laugh whenever I think of one of the guys looking for ugly girls at the bus station and finding Miss Two Bears.

I was reminded just what a compelling and talented actor River Pheonix was and couldn't help feeling sad at various points throughout the film about our loss of his brilliance. Lili Taylor played her character beautifully. Despite her meek, unassuming, and shy manner, her strength shone through and she did not allow Eddie to intimidate her or cause her to back away from her ideals.

As many other reviewers have noted, this film does a wonderful job of capturing the sweetness and the awkwardness of young and new love. I loved the contrast between Eddie's night with Rose and that of his buddies raucous, hollow ramblings.

Where I found the movie lacking was at the end. It felt a little too contrived and formulaic for me, especially in light of the rest of the film and it's attempt to show the illusions of both characters, their extreme difference in view points, and the development of these fledgling new identities that we can only really guess at in the final scene. So much is revealed to us in the subtle scenes and conversations they share in their night together and yet at the end we are only shown one scene from Eddie's experience in Vietnam and must guess at who they have both become and what it is that brings them back together. In addition, there was some very interesting commentary on the United States - its culture and foreign policy - that I think is highly relevant today. This element was very much overshadowed by the love story and I think deserved more focus.

Despite this, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it if not only to see these two great actors in a moving story.",1156896000,9,1694,4.547540983606558

This film is in essence a love story and the two principals, River Phoenix and Lili Taylor are most appealing and believable.  There are other themes that run throughout this film.  It serves as an expose of machismo in it's most phony and cruel forms.  There is also a pacifistic message that runs through it with the nascent conflict in Vietnam in the background.  Director Nancy Savoca weaves these themes passionately into the narrative but doesn't bludgeon the point.  See this film for the heartbreaking final scene for nothing else.

River Phoenix plays Eddie Birdlace, a marine on the eve of being shipped out to Vietnam.  Eddie hardly fits the idea of romantic hero with his callous personality and casual manipulations of Lili Taylor's character Rose. However, her plain appearance masks a quiet strength and sense of self which chips away at his arrogance as the film progresses.

This is a beautifully written and directed romance. Compelling, without suffering from the corniness typical of films in this genre.

The DVD features are skimpy but nevertheless, the film is a must see.",1145232000,6,791,4.880597014925373

This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen.  The description may make this movie sound like a ""chick flick,"" but it's really anything but that.  Anyone who has ever felt the bittersweet rush of a love cut short due to bad timing can certainly relate to this movie.

I won't recount the plot, as many others have done that so well.  I'll just say that I completely agree with the reviewer who describes this film as taking one's breath away.  The almost constant poignancy of this film does just that.  When Eddie (River Phoenix) and Rose (Lili Taylor) kiss for the first time, it's as if I am the one experiencing ""butterflies.""  This is because DOGFIGHT is just so REAL, thanks to the perfect acting of Phoenix and Taylor and the director's thoughtful decisions regarding character and decade authenticity.  River Phoenix hasn't been this beautiful since his Chris Chambers character in STAND BE ME.  This movie is a testament to the fact that Phoenix no doubt would have continued his acting genius had his life not been cut short.

DOGFIGHT can't be categorized as a chick flick because it  transcends the genre.  This isn't your typical Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan love story which works only on one simplistic level.  The plot isn't so simple as YOU'VE GOT MAIL, for instance.  Instead, this story is meant to represent one glorious night in the lives of strangers turned friends turned lovers.  While the night they share is probably meant to represent less than 10 hours, the movie is filmed in such a way that the viewer feels like he/she has shared that ENTIRE night with these two people.  Thus, the viewer understands how one night can be so monumental.  This feeling -- a feeling that the most important hours of one's life are crammed into one or two life-altering experiences -- is the same feeling I get when I watch SAY ANYTHING or BEFORE SUNRISE.  Seriously, if you want to remember what it's like to experience love for the first time, go out and rent this movie.

Lili Taylor embodies her character as an introvert and sweet girl.  Although she has the soft and quiet voice, she has no trouble voicing her feelings and telling River exactly what she means.  The wonderful part about this is that Lili, although considered chubby in the movie, doesn't lack her self-esteem and won't settle for treatment less than what she deserves.

It is a brilliant and unique love story -and wonderfully  acted by Rivers and Taylor..I also had great time  watching the supporting cast especially the - 'dogfight women'-

The film starts with Eddie Birdlace AKA Birdlegs ( Phoenix ) reminiscing about the night before he left for the Vietnam war. We learn about his three marine friends who help him form the Four B's. The last night before they leave they embark on a traditional girl hunt called "" Dogfight "". The object is to find the ugliest woman you can find and bring her to the marine's dance so she can be judged on. If your date is the ugliest, you win money. Sounds cruel? Well it is. Anyway, Eddie finds quiet, innocent slightly plump and unique-looking Rose ( Lili Taylor ) at her mother's diner. He's attracted to her singing more than her figure. He ropes her into accepting his invitation to the dogfight. Seeing how Rose doesn't have many dates she jumps at the chance to be with the handsome marine. At the dance Rose learns of the horrible reason Eddie invited her. Eddie makes it his mission of the night to apologize. By this time he really likes her. She allows him to take her for a night on the town in which the two fall hopelessly in love. They end the night very romantically and Eddie leaves to hook up with the other B's so they can leave for the war.
This movie is one of the most touching I have ever seen. It drug out many emotions. I was angry at how cruel Eddie could be, but at the same time I felt sorry for him. I realized he didn't know any better. The turning point was how Rose was able to show him that his faults may not have been visible as hers, but were actually worse. The acting was wonderful. Lili and River did a great job and they fit the parts beautifully. Taylor is always a breath of fresh air and is one of the most underrated film stars. This is another movie that saddens River fans because unfortunately he is no longer with us. Dogfight was River's best film in my opinion. It's a love story that tugs at your heart and opens your eyes. It's a film for everyone to enjoy. And for the record, Lili Taylor is prettier than most. The sad thing about this film is that "" dogfights "" are real. But this movie allows the culprits to see how their victims feel.  Lili Taylor is a true winner in this one.

But before it's over one of the women (Lili Taylor) catches on, and delivers a passionate, disquieting denouncement of not only the treatment she received from her uncomfortable escort Eddie (River Phoenix) and his friends, but their complete disregard for the feelings of the other women.  Rather than delivering a hysterical diatribe, Lili Taylor showed in her speech the depth and integrity of her character, while remaining vulnerable and awkward and hurt and unsure.  Despite the late hour, I stayed with the film to the end and delighted in finding an unpretentious, intelligent, subtle coming of age story that continually developed its characters in more and more believable ways to a powerful, if quiet, conclusion.
Set in San Francisco just before the JFK assassination, Rose (Taylor) and Eddie (Phoenix) overcome the questionable beginnings of their relationship and spend a long night tentatively exploring the town and each other before Eddie ships out to Okinawa on his way to some little country called Viet Nam.  Phoenix delivers a superb performance as a young man on the verge of many revelations about his world and himself.  He carefully unveils Eddie's willingness to work past his macho conformity and see Rose for who she really is without resorting to cliche or uncharacteristic sensitivity (the sexual revolution and women's rights are still only blips on the horizon).  Taylor imbues the role of Rose with a fascinating complexity: shy but unafraid, principled but mischievous, practical but romantic, not classically pretty but revealing her down-to-earth appeal bit by bit as her comfort with Eddie grows.  Meanwhile, their adventures are paralleled by the far more conventional let's-paint-the-town-red hijinks of Eddie's three buddies who are shipping out with him the next morning.  Director Nancy Savoca is masterful in her balancing of storylines and characters, and evoking the setting and the era through the music Rose loves - the just-emerging protest tunes of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie, et al.  You can feel the sands shifting under your feet as the age of innocence begins to give way to the age of outrage.  And the last scene is terrific in its understatement in the midst of a sea change.
My only quarrel with this wonderful movie is the San Francisco of a few years later, after the upheaval of the counter-culture.  Did EVERYONE wear tie-dyed hairbands and fringed vests and frizzed hair??  Maybe they did, but the transformation was jarring in this otherwise beautifully understated film.

448501,5,630228354X,"Dogfight is a simple story set in a complex time(early '60's/ Vietnam War time).  River Phoenix and Lili Taylor are both phenomenal in this low budget film directed by Nancy Savoca.  It is set in 1963 San Francisco, four Marines are out on the town for thier last night of fun before shipping out to Okinawa.  They have arranged a ""dogfight"", a contest where the Marine with the ugliest ""date"" wins.  Little did Eddie Birdlace(Phoenix) know, he would find true love in Rose Tinney(Taylor), his ""date"" for the contest.  This movie is the most realistic, touching, and darkly humorous love story I've ever seen.  I saw it for the first time several years ago and fell in love with it. Phoenix gives his best performance, next to My Own Private Idaho, in this film, and Taylor hers next to I Shot Andy Warhol.  This film also has a great soundtrack, lots of folk music not normally used in early '60's period films, though it must be out of print because I can't seem to find it anywhere.  This film didn't see a wide release and is fairly hard to find in rental stores, but it is well worth your time and money to get it.  If you like the everyday, run-of-the-mill, romance films, you will love this extraordinary one.  It's fresh and new, not like the more commercial films of this genera.  It is definately a must have for River Phoenix or Lili Taylor fans.",979776000,6,1357,4.497959183673469
448525,5,630228354X,This movie will make you cry. It'll break your heart! It is so sweet and it illustrates how sometimes love has more power over us than we like to believe. It takes place in one night. Just one night and two people  accidently fall in love and share times neither will ever forget. But what  happens after he ships out for Vietnam? The end will make you choke down  the tears.,961200000,,375,4.253521126760563

It touched me so much the first time I viewed it that I now watch it every chance I get, it never gets boring! I am  so  glad that it  was not  a huge hit at the box office, I  feel like it is my little secret,  shhhh, don't tell your friends.

It's such a beatiful film that makes you feel warm inside (but not in a ""chick Flick"" sort of way) I enjoyed it very very much. It's a movie for any and  everybody!

There is nothing better than this movie. Lili Taylor  gives an exelent performance as Rose, River Pheonix's ""ugly"" date  for the evening. Now, I've seen this movie about twenty times, and each  time I am pulled into this wonderful love story. Anyone who has a soul will  love this movie.",948672000,2,437,4.636363636363637
448531,5,630228354X,"I saw Dogfight some years ago and now own it. I fell in love with this movie instantly. Why this film had a limited release is questionable. Movies like Titanic make over a billion dollars at the box office with  terrible dialog and character development, when a wonderful little film  like Dogfight makes fewer than 500,000 dollars.  To a true film lover this  is a crime.  Unfortunately the public rather see films like Titanic,  instead of a good quality film like Dogfight.  Dogfight proved that you do  not need a big budget to make a good film.  Lili Taylor and River Phoenix  do an excellent job in this film.  I could not even pick a favorite scene,  because the move is loaded with them. I find that a lot of video rental  stores do not even offer it, but they sure got enough copies of Titanic to  please, so I suggest buying it. Dogfight is well worth the money.",945043200,18,873,4.408805031446541
7823570,2,630228354X,"Im honestly baffled at the amount of 5 star reviews this movie has received. Im not even sure I want to rate it 2.

I am, by no means, a prude and can honestly say that I enjoy many movies that involve a good chase but the misogynistic standards used in his movie are not really what I find entertaining.

*Spoilers start*

Group of men make a bet to see who can get the ugliest girl, one of the men claims he has attained deep feelings for a woman he chose for his bet, she falls under his spell, he beds her, she gives him her contact info and he leaves the next day - completely making up a lie about her to avoid the embarrassment from his buddies - then tossing her contact info out like she was nothing. And then 3 years later and no contact he decides she is a priority again. The end.

*Spoilers end*

I find this pretty tasteless, honestly. River Phoenix was phenomenal for his time and Id love nothing more for him to have lived, grown and made many more movies but he and Lili Taylor had no chemistry and the intimacy was downright awkward between the two.",1521676800,,1067,4.185365853658537
