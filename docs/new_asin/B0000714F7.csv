7973985,5,B0000714F7,"(This review covers both the First and the Second Generation)

When this series was first broadcast by BBC Television over 26 Sunday nights in 1967, before the days of videotapes, people would turn down dinner invitations on the nights it was shown, and clergymen would alter the times of their services.  I wondered how this enthralling series would stand up some 40 years later.  I need not have worried:  I was as hooked now as I was then.  It is true that some of the minor characters are caricatures, but all the major ones are absolutely brilliant and fully rounded, and one becomes very much involved with them.  Some splendid characters die relatively early in the series:  Old Jolyon (Jospeh O'Conor) and Young Jolyon (Kenneth More);  but others are with us throughout the 16 instalments, notably Soames Forsyte, the crusty, old fashioned and materialist character, so much the son of his father James (John Welsh). We see him ageing convincingly over the span of 47 years; we dislike him for his crass behaviour and are appalled by his marital rape of Irene (Nyree Dawn Porter) in the early episodes, but we also pity him for his aridity (at that time nobody loves him except his sister Winifred, played by Margaret Tyzack), and later we warm to him for his integrity and for the inarticulate love he shows to his daughter Fleur (Susan Hampshire).  Hers, too, is a brilliant performance.  She steals evey scene in which she appears (somewhat masking the flagging pace of some of the later episodes), and she has us veering from being charmed by her quicksilvery nature to being appalled by her selfishness and irresponsibility.  We can understand why Jon (Martin Jarvis) and her decent husband Michael Mont (Nicholas Pennell) are so captivated by her, and we suffer with them because of her wayward nature.

All this is played out against the changing social background as we move from 1879, the age of Gladstone and Disraeli, to the period of the General Strike of 1926.  Perhaps the weakest part in the series are the actual portrayals of the working class; while one of its strong aspects is the meticulous attention given to the Victorian and Edwardian interiors. Galsworthy was interested in the challenge that modern architecture and modern painting represented to that world;  and the series, in black and white, is also a visual treat.

The Forsytes are a very large and complicated family.  The books on which the series is based have a family tree with which one can remind oneself of the relationships between the members of the younger generation. They are sometimes hard to remember; but that it doesn't really matter very much is another tribute to this quite outstanding series.",1135641600,2,2703,4.8818380743982495
7973986,5,B0000714F7,"I loved the 1960s version of The Forsyte Saga! I think the acting, storylines, sets, costumes hold up very well. It is a soap opera and it's also a view of how people lived back then.",1080864000,,183,4.111111111111111
7973987,5,B0000714F7,"I checked out this 1967 televison production of ""The Forsyte Saga: First Generation"" because of the 2002 mini-series, having not (yet) read the three novels and two short stories that make up John Galsworthy's epic. These two adaptations cover the same part of the saga, covering ""The Man of Property"" (1906), the short story interlude ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"" (1918), and the novel ""In Chancery"" (1920), which leaves another interlude, ""Awakening"" (1920) and the novel ""To Let"" (1921) to comprise ""The Forsyte Saga: Second Generation,"" which I look forward to viewing this weekend.
From that perspective it is interesting to look at the relative strengths of each production. The main one for me is that I get a much better sense of Jolyon Forsyte (Kenneth More) being one of the main characters in this version, along with Soames Forsyte (Eric Porter), than I did in the recent version. This is helped by the fact that ""Young"" Jolyon function as the narrator for the story. In terms of Soames I thought that Porter (who I recognized form one of my favorite B-monster movies, ""The Lost Continent"") had the hardness but not the buried heart that made Damian Lewis's performance in the final scene of the 2002 production so effective (and I want to track down Errol Flynn's performance as the original Soames in ""That Forsyte Woman""). Then there is Irene Forsyte ne Heron, the woman who is loved by each of the Forsytes, and my clear preference is for Nyree Dawn Porter in this version, because there is more of a sense of this woman being able to go on her own when dictated by the situation.
Overall there is clearly a sense of all of the characters in this dysfunctional family from the modern version. The problem is not that there are so many characters to juggle but rather than there are few opportunities for many of them to be established in our minds. For me the most compelling character was Old Jolyon Forsyte (Joseph O'Conor), who eventually decides that family is more important than propriety. All of the elements of his story are here, but they just seem sketched to be rather than fully developed. The same can be said for Irene's affair with Phillip Bosinney (John Bennett), the intended fiance of young June Forsyte (June Barry). The whole motivation and rational for that is suggested rather than revealed.
One benefit of this historical production, which led directly to the birth of ""Masterpiece Theater"" on PBS as a way of showing this series to American television audiences, being filed in black & white is that there are able to include actual film of the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. Ultimately, I am not bothered by either the black & white photography or the soap opera type sets. The limitations of this production are in the adaptation of Galsworthy's story by Lennox Philips and Donald Wilson, which gives us a sense of the breadth but not the depth of this narrative. However, this does not detract from the importance of this series in television history. Whatever its shortcomings this was the ""mini-series"" that opened the door for scores of noteworthy BBC programs.",1051747200,22,3111,4.8277153558052435
7973988,5,B0000714F7,"Being an ""older generation"" Forsyte Saga watcher, I first saw this series on PBS when it debuted in the USA in 1969. My whole family watched it faithfully, and I have retained pleasant memories of it ever since. When I saw the flashy and crude remake of the series this past season, I longed mightily to have the original back again, and it is just as good as I remember it.
True, it is in black and white, and the production values are not sophisticated by current standards, but the screenplays and acting are first-rate, and the series gives the viewer a chance to get to know most of the characters in depth. ""The First Generation"" (12 episodes) covers the first two books of Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga, ending with the births of Jon and Fleur Forsyte. The third book in the trilogy is covered in ""The Second Generation,"" along with all of Galsworthy's second trilogy, ""A Modern Comedy."" As a result, the viewer gets to know nearly all of the original Forsyte family, and nearly all the important events are protrayed in detail. The first couple of episodes (Young Jolyon and Helene, the wooing of Irene by Soames) are mainly ""back story,"" but there really isn't anything ""invented""-- They just flesh out what Galsworthy alluded to in the novels anyway. After that, the series sticks to Galsworthy's story with admirable fidelity, even using dialog straight out of the novels in many cases. Some things are left out or greatly truncated, of course, but who cares whether Winifred Forsyte had 2 children or 4, or that Jolly Forsyte (played by Michael York) barely makes an appearance before he dies? Everything that matters is there.
Of course, the older Forsytes, from Old Jolyon and Aunt Ann through the ill-assorted twins James and Swithin, to the dependent aunts Hester and Juley, to Roger and Nicholas, provide a series of wonderful character parts. Old Jolyon and James, Soames' father, get the most airtime, and both parts are played to perfection. And when the mysterious Timothy finally makes an appearance near the end of ""The First Generation,"" it turns out to be well worth the wait. Some of the other secondary roles, such as the cynical George Forsyte and the wastrel Montague Dartie, are memorably played as well.
Naturally, the main focus in ""The First Generation"" is on Young Jolyon, Soames, and Irene. Eric Porter as Soames is simply superb. He is eminently unlikeable in the early episodes, but he is not so extreme that he doesn't leave room to become gradually more sympathetic as the series wears on. Kenneth More as Young Jolyon (More was the big ""star"" of the ensemble in 1967 when the series was made) is very fine, although he has to battle somewhat against the goody-goody aspects of the role. Nyree Dawn Porter is good as Irene. She looks the part, and she acts well enough to be credible. It has to have been very difficult to play such a passive role and make some kind of impression in it, and you also get to see the negative aspects of her character, as well. Just the contrast between her body language and facial expressions when she interacts with Soames in comparison with Young Jolyon, is very striking.
The roles of Bosinney and June Forsyte are well cast, but my favorite of the ""secondary"" characters is Old Jolyon, who goes from being gruff and irrascible to winningly human and, in his ""Indian Summer"" with Irene, gentle and charming. Margeret Tyzack as Soames' sister Winifred is also superb.
The twelve 45-minute programs go past in a twinkling of the eye, and they will leave you hungry to watch ""The Second Generation.""",1045440000,22,3568,4.765751211631664
7973989,5,B0000714F7,"Recently, I was fortunate enough to have seen this fabulous mini-series on PBS'""Masterpiece Theatre"",and from beginning to end, I was fascinated by the trials and tribulations of the Forsyte family. Extremely well done (and what else could anything be coming from WGBH Boston and ""Masterpiece Theatre"" but the highest quality), the acting is first rate with great performances coming from everyone in the cast.  I can't wait to see the next installment, I read that there are supposed to be three movies, so I anxiously await the next two.  Buy this movie immediately, if the price bothers you consider it an investment in a movie that you'll watch over and over again.",1044230400,3,669,4.964285714285714
7973990,5,B0000714F7,"I was lucky enough to be around when the original Saga aired in 1967.  Everything you've heard about it is true...it DID stop traffic and it WAS the only topic of conversation the following day.
I bought the tapes years ago and kept them on the shelf without watching them for fear of spoiling, what was essentially, a wonderful childhood memory.
The ITV 2001 remake prompted me to take a second look at the original and I'm happy to say I wasn't in the least disappointed.  It is still an engrossing story with some terrific acting even if the production values aren't what we're used to today.  It has its faults but if you can look past those you're in for a thrilling ride.
Some casting mistakes were made: Lana Morris in the role of Jo's second wife Helene, overacts in such a way that you suspect they picked her from some [bad] amateur dramatics company, [luckily she's disposed of fairly quickly] and then there's Nyree Dawn Porter's Irene....surely cast for her looks more than her talent.  She embodies the Irene Galsworthy described in his books but her acting performance is - at best - one-dimensional.
Being cast opposite the formidable talents of Eric Porter doesn't help her much either.
Eric Porter is, without a doubt, the definitive Soames.  He effortlessley carries the whole series and gradually evolves from a cold, misunderstood ""man of property"" into a wholly sympathetic figure in the end.  A well deserved Bafta award.
The marital rape scene is very short and brutal but leaves everything to the imagination and is therefore a lot more powerful than that bit of ""fumbling in the dark"" Damian Lewis was doing in the remake.
Instead of just dealing with the protagonists, the original version also gives us extra characters, a whole parade of ageing aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, virtually every character from the books which helps in giving the viewers the feeling that they're dealing with a large, powerful family.
Sure it's more theatrical [I happen to love theatre] and the sets are at times a bit rickety [when Soames tries to break down the door to Irene's bedroom the whole set moves] but all in all, it's a far better effort than the second outing and a must-see...",1042848000,14,2207,4.7643979057591626
7973991,5,B0000714F7,"The 2002 version has living color, minimal character development, and is a cartoon compared with the 1969 version. How can you develop sympathy with the characters when you barely get to know them? Eight hours is also insufficient to develop all of the fascinating and delightful subplots in the original series.
I don't remember Wendy Hiller, Sir John Gielgud, or Sir James Mason being in it, but Kenneth More and Susan Hampshire were. If this series was not Susan Hampshire's debut, it was pretty close to it.",1034899200,9,511,4.885057471264368
7973992,5,B0000714F7,"In my humble opinion this is the definitive production of The Forsyte Saga, originally made in Black-and-White back in the late 1950's - I'm guessing !  I simply cannot recall all of the actors and actresses who appeared along with Eric Porter, but I seem to recall Dame Wendy Hiller and Sir John Gielgud,  and possibly Sir James Mason, but anyway, if you want an historical collectors item with many of the top flight names from the BBC and London's West End of that era, then you couldn't do better than to buy this collection.  I have been trying to obtain a copy of this for many years without success, but now, I've ordered this sight unseen, some four months before the release date and can hardly wait to see it all over again.
