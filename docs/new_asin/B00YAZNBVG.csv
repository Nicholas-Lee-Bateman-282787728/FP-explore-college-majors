7209300,5,B00YAZNBVG,"This was excellent, but it was painful to hear the stories about Monsanto's tactics. I agree with other commenters about Levente Diosady. His comments about wanting labeling because the GMO vs non-GMO products are so different--but then saying he wasn't worried about GMOs-- seemed odd. I really admire the people who farm and especially those who have decided to switch to organic farming. They seem to have a real connection with the earth and they care about other people. This movie led me to write a letter to my state Senator to support legislation to follow Europe's lead to ban GMOs (as well as routine use of antibiotics in livestock), or to at least have clear labeling on products as a start.",1447200000,15,703,4.770491803278689

7209306,5,B00YAZNBVG,"It's a great documentary. It's amazing that despite having seen just about every documentary of this ilk that there is still more to learn.
Professor Levente Diosady is the one gripe that I have among the interviewees; he said that (as a consumer) he is not worried about preservatives, but he still wants to avoid them. That is absurd. He also said that there is not any disadvantage to eating nonorganic. He then said that it is important to label GMOs because there is a gross difference in the way that they are derived. Organic is always nonGMO, and there is a huge difference between organic and not.",1445385600,5,606,4.62037037037037
7209307,5,B00YAZNBVG,"I caught this at a festival recently. Here's my take on the background with a little digging.

Starting with a quote I found from the director:
I am not Anti-GMO. I am free choice  Bryan Law, Director, Of the Land.

This positions the film differently as it's not as anti-GMO as some of the other films that address the subject, though it certainly has its moments. OF THE LAND tries to present a slightly more balanced approach leaving you to decide what you're going to do. I liked that about this film. It's not a ""raging mad"" movie, but one that offers up information you can make decisions on. It also presents some solid history for perspective on experimental farms and how organic farming got us to where we are. I would add, too, that it's quite nicely filmed.

It's also worth noting that the featured people all have solid credentials. Here's what I learned about them:

Dr. Shiv Chopra  Ottawa, Ontario. Formerly a Doctor at Health Canada for over 30 years before he was fired.

Jim Gerritsen  Maine, USA. President of Organic Seed Growers And Trade Association (OSGATA)

Jeffrey Smith  Ohio. Author Seeds of Deception, Institute for Responsible Technology.

Ben and Jessie Sosnicki  Norfolk County, Ontario. Organic family farm

Prof. Levente Diosady  Toronto, Ontario. University of Toronto Department of Food Processing

Prof. Ralph Martin  Guelph, Ontario. Loblaws Chair in Sustainable Food Production at The University of Guelph.

Prof. Gilles-Eric Seralini  France. Conducted one of the only long term studies on GMO/RoundUp foods on rats.

If this subject is of interest to you, OF THE LAND is a unique film on the matter and worth viewing.",1433376000,3,1659,4.945652173913044

7209315,2,B00YAZNBVG,Here is a good example of what bad music can do for what might have been a wonderful movie. Canned drum track with 3 chord vamp repeated endlessly behind the interviews.

7209319,4,B00YAZNBVG,"Sort of depressing documentary but made me want to hug each of my local farmers at my farmer's market

It is scary how wo many health issues have increased as the amount of processed food consumption has increased. In addition to the hormone disruption of glycophosphates, they failed to mention how much earlier puberty is kicking in on kids.

Reinforced to me that we vote with our wallets. I buy very little processed foods and except for avocados and coffee and coconuts, I buy everything local and organic. I regularly update a list of companies acquired by bigger companies that utilize GMOS and won't purchase them (Annies, Kashi...) I'm growing some of my own foods (black thumb of death). It is insane to me how much effort it takes to understand what labeling impacts can be. So many of my friends get so confused - our FDA and USDA are not looking out for us.",1469664000,4,870,4.606451612903226

7209325,1,B00YAZNBVG,"I am interested in the topics of sustainable farming and especially organic farming, but I could not even watch 10 minutes of this documentary. Its an anti-GMO movie and the people who were being interviewed weren't experts. They were farmers or students with biased views on this topic.

Like I said, I only watched the beginning before I was rolling my eyes so hard I got a headache. So I didn't watch the entire film. Because it didn't seem to be worth my time. I would rather find a movie with a fairer approach to any topic at all.",1464652800,3,536,4.414141414141414

7209327,5,B00YAZNBVG,"Excellent documentary of how GMO's are destroying our environment and our health. Small organic farms growing healthy food without pesticides and dangerous chemicals make up less than 2% of our total nation's food production. Industrial agriculture (Big Ag) is the bulk of our food production and jeopardizes the health and safety of our society and planet. If everyone bought ONLY organic food, Monsanto and Dow would be out of business and diseases from food would drop dramatically! Buy Organic and support your local farmers!",1463097600,,529,5.309523809523809

7209329,5,B00YAZNBVG,straightforward and open.  I think it it is a must see for anyone who care about who and how thier food is being grown. If you have doubts do additional research on your own- it is not made up stuff.,1462665600,,199,3.975

7209333,5,B00YAZNBVG,"Wow!!!  Monsanto is a control freak!  The more and more I hear about this company, the scarier it gets!  EVERYONE needs to watch this!  I am so disappointed that our country allows this and values the almighty dollar so much more than the safety of the citizens.  Other countries are putting a foot down, many don't even want food grown in America.

I was not aware that the farmers are penalized for not using Monsanto seeds.  This video brings several of these issues to light.

This video explains how Monsanto genetically modifies our food (seeds) to accept/need the chemicals that they also sell, that in turn causes the animals and people to not feel well.  BUT, guess what?  They happen to also make the drugs to help us feel better.  But they are huge supporters of our US Government, making huge political contributions, hmmm,.....

In summary, the way to win this fight is not thru the US Courts, it is only going to happen thru our buying choices.  If we refuse to eat or buy it, they will have no reason to make it.  But guess what?  Monsanto doesn't want to have to label the food that contains GMOs.  But the foods that DON'T have GMOs will be labeled, so look for those labels.",1461715200,7,1192,4.5
7209334,1,B00YAZNBVG,This movie is basically just a very long a rant against Monsanto. It is not very informative.,1461110400,3,93,4.529411764705882

7209339,4,B00YAZNBVG,"Good movie -- The only way I know how to summarize this documentary is that it is ""Food Inc"" from a primarily Canadian perspective. If you have seen ""Food Inc"", or read ""Omnivore's Dilemma"" by Michael Polan this documentary starts to feel too long 3/4 of way into the movie.

The narrative in the documentary is easy to follow and the production values are good for a documentary genre style movie.",1457308800,,398,4.605633802816901
7209340,5,B00YAZNBVG,"This documentary talks with Canadian farmers and contrasts organic growers with those who use pesticides, herbicides, GMOs, (genetically modified organisms) and makes a pretty good case for organics.  I'm not alone in worrying over all those toxins -- intended for insects and weeds, but necessary in larger doses and in so much of the stuff we eat.  I like to encourage organic by buying it when I can.  They do cost more in general and it is not easy to go organic since it's more work intensive.

In short, it's a real problem and a complex one and one that we need to take seriously.  This documentary does a very good job of discussing the problems and the promise of something that affects us all.  Well worth the time it takes to see it.",1457222400,,744,4.514925373134329

7209345,5,B00YAZNBVG,"I learned very valuable lessons from the movie and agree that consumers need to be educated and be aware of the problem in order to push back the big corporations. Court room and legal warfare is their strength. Education and awareness is the people's strength.

First, I need to change myself and my family on the choices we make and the perception of artificially low food price and keep doing so every time we buy something (it's a battle of the mind, the corps know and so they manipulate your mind with marketing tactic like ads, visuals, slogans, etc.) And by voting with our mouth and wallet, organic and non-GMO will be much more accessible. Looking back, it's much better than before and that is a positive note. We're getting there! Thanks for creating movies like this.",1455321600,5,780,4.693430656934306

Unfortunate that this is categorized as a documentary. There is little expert input. Anecdotes are not data. The focus on GM crops and Monsanto when talking about vegetable production is bewildering.
