5370609,5,B009WY24IG,Thank you for making a DVD perfect for each trimester. The instructor is going through her pregnancy as well. She says just the right things. I highly recommend this DVD over any other DVD.,1396569600,2,189,4.588235294117647
5370610,5,B009WY24IG,"I'm so glad I found this one! It's absolutely worth the investment. The other prenatal yoga DVDs I've tried have been awkward and not particularly enjoyable. Hala's teaching style is lovely, and she's a person you actually enjoy spending some time with each day. When she gives instruction and advice, she's really focusing on mental and physical well-being rather than superficial goals. I also really appreciate the production quality . . . the settings are beautiful and calming (no boring, empty room like some other DVDs) and the music is a pleasure to hear. You can choose a section depending on the time of day and how you're feeling: I like the warm up for the morning, or energize and strengthen if I have lots of energy, and rest and restore or meditation in the evening.",1394582400,7,781,4.75
5370611,5,B009WY24IG,It's worth the money spent! It's the best prenatal yoga practice you will find!! I am enjoying every moment of it...,1391644800,,116,4.571428571428571
5370612,5,B009WY24IG,"This is an absolutely fantastic prenatal DVD. I'm in the first trimester of my second pregnancy and an avid yoga practitioner. During my first pregnancy, I tried a number of prenatal DVDs and none of them seemed to ""click"". I found this, and decided to give it a go for round two, and I'm so happy I did. Such a nice mix of asanas, from the warm-up through the energizing section and the restorative sections. Hala is a great instructor and seems very down-to-earth. I would recommend this DVD to people that already have a yoga practice and beginners - everyone would get something out of it.",1391126400,4,593,4.5514018691588785
5370613,5,B009WY24IG,Got this for my niece and she loves it.  Can't say much more since I've not view it for myself,1389225600,,94,3.7
5370614,5,B009WY24IG,I searched and searched for a good prenatal yoga video. This one is fantastic! Different disc for each trimester. It feels like a real yoga class. Not weird or cheesy like some others I found. It is the best part of my day sometimes.,1379030400,2,233,4.318181818181818
5370615,5,B009WY24IG,"Hala has a really nice tone to her teaching. Honest, non-judgmental, her sequencing is well paced, and instruction well timed.",1376956800,3,126,5.35
5370616,5,B009WY24IG,"I received this as a gift and absolutely love it. I like how it is broken up into sections, warm up, strengthen and stabilize, rest and restore, and meditation. Its ready for me to fit this into my day. I was amazed at how wonderful my body felt after starting these sessions. Strengthen and stabilize was hard for me at first, but with only a few times going through it, I could tell a huge difference in my performance. I worked out with a personal trainer pre pregnancy, and then it all came to a screeching halt. I feel like this is helping me to maintain some tone and strength, as well as accept the changes to my body and bond with my baby. I highly recommend this to any pregnant woman!",1358640000,2,694,4.265151515151516
5370617,5,B009WY24IG,"I bought Radiant Pregnancy after coming out of the first trimester blahs. I wish I had bought it much earlier! The videos are structured so that you can choose what sections you want to do (any or all) and the instruction is both caring and informative. If you're like me, you've received all kinds of advice on what to do and what not to do during pregnancy. This program is a great reminder that we can still be quite mobile even when we're knocked up!",1358294400,,454,4.352941176470588
5370618,4,B009WY24IG,"A great workout that I enjoyed throughout my pregnancy. The third trimester DVD I found too difficult toward the end, though!",1480636800,,125,5.0
5370619,5,B009WY24IG,"These workouts helped relieve my back tension, strengthened by arms and legs, and helped me feel more relaxed and connected with my baby during pregnancy. With the stress and uncertainty that's often part of pregnancy, it's important to just stop and be in the moment for a few minutes. This DVD helped me actually enjoy my pregnancy. I recommend it to anyone expecting or to those who are looking for a gift for a pregnant friend. Better than a one-time trip to the spa!",1477267200,,471,4.619047619047619
5370620,5,B009WY24IG,"I love this DVD! great mix of strengthening and stretching exercises with separate meditation and relaxation sections. You can do one or more, based on how your feeling and energy levels. I have not done the 3rd trimester one yet, just the first and second and I love them. Just enough of an exercise to feel energized but not too much to overdo it. She has a very calming voice and I really like how reassuring and relaxing she is. There are 3 dvds one for each trimester and each dvd has separate parts with the warm up which is about 20 mins, strengthen and stabilize exercises which is about 25 mins, rest and restore which is about 20 mins and finally the meditation which is short only about 5 mins. I really love this dvd and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is pregnant looking for a yoga/stretching routine that is safe and satisfying.",1473724800,3,860,4.449367088607595
5370621,5,B009WY24IG,The best prenatal yoga dvd. I only wish I had discovered it earlier. Doing this dvd helped alleviate my back pain.,1465776000,,114,4.476190476190476
5370622,2,B009WY24IG,"I had trouble getting this video to play properly in my DVD player.  The DVD navigation didn't work correctly, so I couldn't choose exactly which session I wanted to do.  Video quality wasn't high.",1455580800,,197,4.764705882352941
5370623,5,B009WY24IG,"My first prenatal yoga DVD purchase was a bit too advanced for me. I really enjoy this one. She gives tips to the less advanced to use blocks or pillows, which is great. I really like her messages to you during the practice to help connect you to your body and baby and to prepare for childbirth and recovery. Very encouraging and calming.",1451779200,2,339,4.396825396825397
5370624,5,B009WY24IG,It's great how she made 3 separates DVDs for each trimester.  I wish I had ordered it earlier because I only had a short time with the 2nd trimester dvd but have been using the 3rd trimester one a lot.  So worth it.,1449792000,2,215,3.9767441860465116
5370625,5,B009WY24IG,"Really well done dvd.  Challenging, but mindful of pregnancy - not too easy.  Helpful for mind and body.  I like the length of each session but also appreciate that I can choose individual sections if I don't have as much time.",1448236800,,227,4.487804878048781
5370626,3,B009WY24IG,Kind of annoying,1444867200,,16,4.666666666666667
5370627,5,B009WY24IG,"This DVD set has been perfect for me (currently early in my second trimester).  The first trimester DVD is gentle enough that I felt I had the energy for it during the first trimester, but still invigorating with lots of leg-strengthening positions.  The second trimester DVD has a bit more of the strengthening positions.  I have yet to try the third trimester DVD.

I must admit I have only been able to complete the entire DVD three or four times without being interrupted (I have a toddler :-)) but I love Hala's reminders to be forgiving and accepting of ourselves.  I can't think of other pregnancy workout DVDs that focus so much on accepting not only your body but also your emotions.  I know during my first pregnancy I was guilty of trying to do too much, and of being too hard on myself.  It's nice to have someone outside tell you it's okay to be worried and stressed, and that acceptance helps me let go.

The few times I've been able to make it all the way through the DVD and complete the restorative section I have often fallen asleep during the last positions - I'm telling myself that means it's working!  ;-)

I've used a few other pregnancy yoga DVDs, but as a very tired and pregnant mommy of a toddler this is currently my favorite.  If you are looking for a challenging workout there are other great DVDs out there, but this has been perfect for me as a restorative, invigorating hour and a half.",1442188800,4,1419,4.461240310077519
5370628,5,B009WY24IG,"I love this program. As an intermediate practitioner, I do yoga to feel energized and refreshed, and to connect with my mind, body, and breath for a few minutes each day. These classes offer the perfect balance of peaceful introspection and active engagement with your changing body, building strength, flexibility, and awareness in the process.

A couple specifics about this program:

1. This program comes with three classes (one for each trimeter) and each class is divided into 4 sections: warm up (16 min), energize and strengthen (21 min), rest and restore (24 min) and meditation (5 min). You can play the entire class all the way through, or if you don't have the time or energy for the full practice, you can also select individual sections from the DVD menu. This is a huge advantage over other programs I've tried, where you either have to fast forward to the section you want or don't have the option to modify the class length at all. I try to do the full program as often as I can, but each section really does work beautifully on its own too, and I love having the flexibility to adapt my practice to how I feel on any given day.

2. Hala Khouri is a fantastic instructor. Her directions are clear and her poses are easy to follow, and she manages to engage your whole body throughout each class. Some classes I've tried have been way too easy, almost treating your body like it was handicapped, while others seem to barely acknowledge the unique physiological needs of pregnant women. Hala Khouri emphasizes the strength and beauty of your changing body while also recognizing and embracing the limits you may be facing, without any judgement, just openness and acceptance. No matter how long or short a program I choose, I always feel rejuvenated and restored by the end.

3. Perhaps even more importantly, Hala Khouri is able to connect in a real way to the mental and emotional changes you may be experiencing due to your pregnancy, and to help you prepare for the journey ahead. Without overdoing it, she manages to help you feel more connected to yourself, to your baby, and to the supportive community of other mothers and loved ones who will help you throughout your pregnancy by offering observations about the complexity of the childbearing process. She does not assume that pregnancy is a one size fits all condition, and allows excitement, anxiety, fatigue, joy, or whatever you may be feeling to be a part of your practice. She also connects the mental with the physical, for example by encouraging you to notice tension or sensations in your body without reacting to them, and to focus on your breath even when you are experiencing discomfort, both of which are great practice for when you are in labor.

In sum, this is a wonderful prenatal program and I would recommend it to anyone, no matter how experienced or inexperienced. I actually look forward to doing these classes as frequently as possible, and honestly believe that they have helped maintain my physical and emotional health more than any other practice I've done during my pregnancy. Thank you Hala Khouri!

p.s. After a few months of Hala 4-5 days a week, I've added a few other DVDS to my routine simply for the sake of variety (Hala is still my favorite). I recommend Element Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower (well-balanced and concise), Prenatal Vinyasa & Short Forms with Jennifer More (for a challenge), and Prenatal Yoga with Jane Austin (gentle but still engaging) as alternatives.",1428364800,15,3495,4.787728026533997
5370629,5,B009WY24IG,"My husband gifted this to me for Christmas and I love it! I'm in my second trimester, so that's the only disc I've used so far. I loooove this practice from start to finish. It starts with a good warm up, then moves on to ""strengthen and stabilize"". I felt challenged by this segment in a positive way. My hips, legs, and glutes did a lot of work! Which is exactly what I want/need. She explains things well and is easy to follow. Props are necessary for two poses in this practice. I've never owned true yoga props. I easily improvise using throw blankets (rolled up to substitute for bolster), firm throw pillows (substitute for block) etc. So don't run out and buy all the props unless you just want to! Many of the poses include the option to use a block or blanket for support, but I didn't find it necessary for myself (although that may change as I get bigger!) Anyways! I enjoyed the structure of the practice, the poses, music, instructor, explanations, and the video itself is visually pleasing. Very happy and satisfied with this. I will definitely use other Hala Khouri yoga DVDs in the future, pregnant or not!",1420848000,2,1123,4.536945812807882
5370630,5,B009WY24IG,I bought this to help me in my first pregnancy which unfortunately ended in a miscarriage before I was able to try it. So after months of trying to get pregnant again I started using this for relaxation and stress relief hoping we would get pregnant again! Sure enough!! One month of doing the first trimester DVD and we were pregnant again! I also used her soundtracks for relaxation during my hypnobirthing! Definitely recommend this for pre-pregnancy relaxation as well staying active during pregnancy!,1416268800,,505,5.023809523809524
5370631,5,B009WY24IG,Love this DVD! Feel like I'm finally doing proper yoga again! My thighs were sore for 3 days!,1414454400,,93,4.222222222222222
5370632,5,B009WY24IG,I love this yoga DVD. The sessions are short but very effective. She doesnt take it easy on you. But you feel so good afterwards.,1414195200,,129,4.2
5370633,1,B009WY24IG,"I'm not sure if just my DVD is defective, but in the menu screen I am unable to highlight which section I want to do because nothing gets bold when you select it. This is very frustrating. I have to play the video and fast forward each section. Not convenient. In addition I find it annoying that Hala has a tank top on that is too short. She is frequently pulling it down which is distracting. I would not recommend this video.",1410566400,,428,4.2317073170731705
5370634,5,B009WY24IG,"Incredible DVD! - Worth every penny and more.
A wonderful and full experience at the expert and gentle guidance of Hala.",1409270400,,120,4.761904761904762
5370635,5,B009WY24IG,"I am thoroughly enjoying this DVD set so far. I am in my second trimester, so have not tried the 3rd trimester sequence yet.
For me, this style of yoga is perfect. I am using it in conjunction with other forms of exercise--I use this on the same day that I go for a 4-5 mile jog to help stretch out and relax. I have also been using Suzanne Bowen's Prenatal Barre (which is also excellent but much more of a toning workout) or other strengthening exercises on alternate days.
If you plan on using this as your only form of exercise or are expecting something highly intense, this is probably not the best bet.  I would describe it as gentle stretching and movement with a strong mind-body focus. It has been an excellent addition to my prenatal routine!",1407974400,,753,4.41726618705036
5370636,3,B009WY24IG,"The video is relaxing, which is nice, but it's too short, and not enough of a workout.  I was hoping I would get a mix of relaxing/work out, but it each workout is also very short.  It's a nice video to relax and stretch out a bit, but I was hoping to get more of a workout since this was the only form of exercise I'm doing in my pregnancy.",1403395200,,341,3.857142857142857
5370637,5,B009WY24IG,"I like this very much. Have been doing yoga for many years so I wanted to keep doing during pregnancy. But I didn't feel comfortable to keep doing the yoga class at my gym.

I felt very good and safe doing the exercises and poses from the DVD. It's very gentle but sometimes I still feel it gets a little tiring. It can be a bit hard but nothing excessive.

You need to have some props like cushions, yoga blocks and strap for some of the poses, but I manage to improvise with stuff I have at home and it worked.

I recommend for any expectant mom. Yoga is amazing!",1401667200,2,565,4.118181818181818
8544788,5,B009WY24IG,Love this! Great routines!,1520553600,,26,5.75
8544789,5,B009WY24IG,Purchased for my daughter. She found the exercises to be very good when she reached the 5-month point. Prior to that she did more vigorous workouts.,1515196800,,148,4.730769230769231
8544790,5,B009WY24IG,"This is a wonderful prenatal yoga workout.  The instructor is pleasant and seems to know her stuff; she does a great job of providing little pieces of encouragement and mindfulness in regards to child-bearing throughout the videos. I love that there's a separate workout for each trimester, which addresses changing needs throughout pregnancy.  I also love that each workout is broken up into sections (there is a strength portion, a flexibility portion, a relaxation portions), so you can do the whole thing for a comprehensive workout, or, if your pressed for time or just not feeling it that day, you can choose one or two sections and just do those.  This was perfect for my prenatal fitness needs, ESPECIALLY later in my pregnancy when I dropped other workout activities... kept me committed up to the end!",1505952000,,811,4.948529411764706
8544791,4,B009WY24IG,"If you're looking for a hardcore work out - move on.
If you're looking for a practice that opens your body, mind, and heart for a healthy pregnancy - Stay Right Here. I tried a few other work out videos in my first trimester and found motivation a little difficult. I bought this for my second/third trimesters based on the great reviews. I have completed the full 70 minute sequence and have also used the video in bits and pieces that fit my schedule. There is are the following units in the second trimester: intro (5 min), warm up/stretch (20 min), strength/standing poses (20 min), restorative poses (20 min), and a closing meditation (5 min) unit. I have been sore from the standing poses the day after I use this video and find that the instructor offers a great range of movement that helps you to connect with your body. This is my first pregnancy and I often feel disconnected from the person that I appear to be changing into. The videos offer sound advise regarding personal acceptance, achieving strength for your labor/delivery, and tuning into your personal needs. I generally feel that the amount of talking and guidance is appropriate and I like the meditative international vibe music. I feel more centered and at peace after each session and I would strongly encourage any pregnant woman to consider this 3 trimester set. This can be used by a beginner to intermediate yoga student - advanced students may wish to find a better fit.
* Important to note: as you progress in pregnancy, the number of ""modified"" positions increases to protect your changing body. While some mods are hand placement or taking a less strenuous stretch - many require PROPS. I am an intermediate yoga student and already owned a mat and blocks, but went out and bought a proper bolster and strap so that I could fully relax into the restorative poses. I was trying to get away by using all of my living room blankets and pillows, but it's not the same. I invested in myself and bought some quality pieces that I intend to use through the rest of this pregnancy and beyond. Please understand that the benefits of using the right equipment will translate into a marvelously helpful/healthful experience for you. I promise that after you do the routine once through you'll know what things you need around your mat and you'll be glad you took care of yourself.
**Other note: the menu screen simply doesn't work right in my DVD player. When the screen comes up, the individual titles don't light up when I try to maneuver around the menu screen so I can't tell what I'm selecting. It's annoying, but the video is so good! I hate to take a star away because I have no problems with the content, but this is a daily problem that shouldn't exist.",1505692800,2,2735,4.641237113402062
8544792,1,B009WY24IG,"You will need props to complete this video including: a boaster, yoga blankets, two blocks, and yoga mat. The timing and poses were helpful. Each section: warm up, middle and end were approximately 20 minutes long. The mediation section can only be competed with yoga props. I tried using my own pillows and blankets but found it didn't provide enough support. My main distaste with this video was the instructor. She had an enormous tattoo across her bicep. I am all for tattoos and have them myself but I found this to be very, very distracting. The tattoo wasn't even great looking which made it even worse. I probably spent more time concentrating on trying to figure out her tattoo than focusing on my poses.  I do not recommend this video.",1505088000,,745,4.687022900763359
8544793,3,B009WY24IG,"As an avid fitness person, it's tough for me to stay engaged in such a slow video. I usually do HIIT, weights, stair stepper, elliptical, everything and I know I really need to incorporate yoga (especially during pregnancy). However, it was soooo hard for me to want to continue due to bordem. I'm sure it's great for stretching your pelvic region if you have more patience than I do!",1499212800,,384,4.579710144927536
8544794,5,B009WY24IG,"Only tried the second trimester DVD so far but have been very pleased with it. Hala Khouri has a very gentle, soothing voice and I find the practice to be a great way to connect with my baby during pregnancy.  The exercises in the 2nd trimester DVD are well suited to my energy level and they still feel like a good workout without making me feel like I can't keep up.  I have practiced yoga before so wasn't a beginner but I feel like this DVD would be great for beginners as well.  I absolutely love the restorative poses as well, which are the third segment of the DVD though know that you will have to buy special equipment (yoga bolster and yoga strap) to take advantage of various exercises.  The room in which the DVD was filmed is very relaxing and welcoming and I also love the music.  I'd say if you like Shiva Rea's style of yoga, you would enjoy this one as well.  It also has a good mind/body component without getting totally new agey as some of Shiva Rea's DVDs.",1493164800,,977,4.282608695652174

8544797,5,B009WY24IG,"I have really enjoyed doing this in my living room throughout my pregnancy. Hala Khouri is an amazing guide, her practice is challenging enough to make you feel like you're working the right muscles while also not resulting in overexertion. I was an active person pre-pregnancy and it was hard to realize my body had more limits as my pregnancy progressed, so this has been a very good way to stay active while not overdoing it. I received this DVD as a gift and have since sent it as a gift to all my pregnant friends. I also recommend purchasing a bolster -- I received this one as a gift as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugger-Mugger-Standard-Bolster-Poppy/dp/B00C83F6AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugger Mugger Standard Bolster, Poppy</a>&nbsp;and I love it (it's kind of expensive though!).
