4689442,4,B005G5NPWY,"I just had to make a quick review in order to see if anyone else who owns this DVD has experienced the same issue.  On Disc 1 of Conan The Adventurer Season 2 Vol. 1. there seems to be a problem with the episode entitled ""The Red Brotherhood"".  Towards the end of that particular episode(about 16-17 min into it), there is a noticeable line towards the top of the screen that seems to be either an animation error/defect when the episodes where first created.

Has anyone else experienced this same problem while viewing this episode? I'm curious, so please let me know.",1327708800,5,570,4.568627450980392
4689443,5,B005G5NPWY,"I didn't watch this as a kid.  I thought how in the world could they make a cartoon for kids based off of Conan the Barbarian.  I saw the movie back then.  No way.  Then there was the complete Serpentor rip-off outfit and I was done.  But I love cartoons so as an adult I thought, ""what the hey.""  These cartoons are very entertaining in my view.  I'm glad I bought them.  Stories are not half bad and the animation is 80's based.  I like this.  I'm enjoying the story arcs.  Some of the episodes come off as single shows but there is an underlining story of collecting all the star metal and finding a cure for his parents.  Enjoyable and a lot of fun.",1323820800,6,653,4.136

4689451,4,B005G5NPWY,"This series has nostalgic value for those who loved it when they were younger.  It's value is beyond that.  This particular series has strong appeal to boys and to a man's inner child.  Conan has many incarnations, and the good ones are loved by men everywhere.

Conan is a warrior, a protector, a leader and an avenger.  His skill improves with each battle.  He's a barbarian - he's not bound by society's rules.  He's guided by personal strength, courage, friendship and honor.  He needs little more than his muscles and his sword.

Long Live Conan",1419724800,2,550,4.705263157894737

Its not the Howard Conan, or even the Marvel Conan, or the movie Conans, but its not bad I won't knock it - it is pretty good for what it is - a Conan aimed at a younger audience.
