4935075,4,B00634MLIQ,"Warner hits another home run with this 3 disc set that features the Blu-ray individual releases for ""V For Vendetta"", ""Watchmen"" (not the multi-disc special edition) and ""Constantine"".

All three movies look quite nice in their Blu-ray presentation and all the special features that were on the individual disc releases are here as well--except for the second disc for ""Watchmen"" )which is a nice plus for people who thought they might be short changed because this is an inexpensive release).

""V for Vendetta"" is based on Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name (as is ""Watchmen"")and the theme here is fantasy based graphic novels/comic books.

If you haven't picked up this set from the exceptional to the merely decent (""Constantine""), all three are worthwhile to pick up at this price.

""V"" and ""Watchmen"" are the best of the bunch here (with ""V"" slightly edging out ""Watchmen"" for me).

I LIKE ""Constantine"" but wish it was a much better movie and that the crack, imaginative visual effects were matched by the storytelling.

4935077,5,B00634MLIQ,"-V for Vendetta rates as one of my ALL TIME favorite films. It so totally rocked my world when I saw it for the first time.
""Remember Remember the 5th of November,
 The gunpowder treason and plot.
 I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason
 Should ever be forgot""

Based on the Graphic Novel by alan moore, this is a movie that changed the way I think. Ofcourse I've met many who don't love this movie the way I do, but just for this movie alone, I'd rate this collection 5 stars. Some don't like this movie because of the long dialogues and absence of clichd action sequences, and those are the very reasons, I love this movie.

""People should not be afraid of their governments.
 Governments should be afraid of its people.""

When I heard that line, I knew then, that I'd always love this movie.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Watchmen

Another movie that's based on the acclaimed graphic novel by Alan moore.
The movie was very interesting and very very true to the graphic novel. Almost too true at times, causing the movie to stretch out and get a little slow in the middle. There are some parts that could have been edited out...But the fact remains that this is an pretty good movie. A very different take on superheroes.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Constantine

Based on the Hellblazer comics from Vertigo Comics.(correct me if I'm wrong). It has parts taken from the ""Dangerous Habits"" story.
While not the best of movies (partly due to Keanu Reeves continuing his poker face act from his Mr. Anderson days), I enjoyed it anyway. The spear of Destiny, Half-demons and Half-Angels kept me riveted. I loved the portrayal of hell and in a very strange way, it even made sense.

V FOR VENDETTA (2005): 132 minutes - Director: James McTeigue - Starring: Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea - Genre: Crime, drama- Plot: In a future British tyranny, a shadowy freedom fighter plots to overthrow it with the help of a young woman. R

WATCHMEN (2009): 162 minutes - Director: Zack Snyder - Starring: Patrick Wilson, Jackie Earle Haley, Carla Gugino - Genre: Superhero, crime - Plot: In an alternate 1985 where former superheroes exist, the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante Rorschach into his own sprawling investigation, uncovering something that could completely change the course of history as we know it. R

CONSTANTINE (2005): 121 minutes - Director: Francis Lawrence - Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Tilda Swinton - Genre: Supernatural, action - Plot: Constantine tells the story of irreverent supernatural detective John Constantine, who has literally been to hell and back. R

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $12.49, and contains 3 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $4.16 per film, an amazing deal for these action packed, entertaining, and stunning comic book films!

4935136,5,B00634MLIQ,"All 3 of these films in high-def on Bluray in one collection? What's not to love??

I never saw V for Vendetta when it was released. I thought the V character looked doofy in the grinning harlequin mask so I passed on it. Silly me. Like most British films, there is far more talk than action, but the talk is intelligent and well thought out and leaves you with something to discuss after the film's over other than how cool the explosions looked or how impressive the stunts were. Nice.

Watchmen will never be as good as the source material but, with very few exceptions, what is? Others can give you far more info on the film & the graphic novels than me. Seek out those critics & user reviews if you're really interested. I enjoyed the movie, more or less, and appreciate that someone at least TRIED to bring the books to the big screen. The success of that adaption... well...

My wife & I both enjoyed Constantine. I still think someone far older than Keanu Reeves should have played the part but the film as a whole was pretty good. Not spectacular or awesome, but good.

I got this collection used, so for what I paid for it ...it was an excellent bargain.",1388016000,2,1164,4.4
4935137,5,B00634MLIQ,"I owned the DVD versions of all three of these and thanks to this I was able to open up some shelf space and upgrade to Blu-ray.

V for Vendetta isn't the action packed movie that some thought it would be.  There is more to the story than jumping around throwing knives.  I think that lead to the negative reception but it has lead to my enjoyment of the movie.  There is a good moral to the story and I think everyone should watch it with an open mind just once at least.

Watchmen has a good bit of action and also poses some interesting questions and moral dilemmas.  Some of the purists may have hated this but it brought the story to many that would never have experienced it.

Constantine is just a good supernatural action flick.  There is a good story but this is much more about Keanu Reeves killing demons in my opinion.

Buy this for a cheap way to enjoy them all. It includes all of the special features that came on the DVDs that I had at least and I don't know of any that are missing other than the digital copy that came with my copy of Watchmen.",1387411200,2,1062,4.166666666666667

My movie reviews:

I haven't watched ""V for Vendetta"" with this set, but I plan to.  I recently saw a preview that made me think that maybe I wasn't paying all that much attention to the movie when I first saw it and I think I owe it another look.

""Constantine"" is good film.  Not great, but good.  The visuals make it a good pairing with the other two films.

""Watchmen"" was impressive.  The film was faithful to the graphic novel both in style and in story which is a masterful achievement.  The subject matter may not be for everyone, but even my wife, who abhors violent films was impressed.  Dear Hollywood, there's no substitute for *story*.",1383177600,,949,4.461988304093567

4935157,3,B00634MLIQ,"The picture and sound quality are the same as the DVD versions.  If you already own the DVDs, then wait for a remastered set to materialize.  If you don't own then on DVD, then this is an inexpensive way to pick them up.

V for Vendetta is a fantastic movie.  It's one of those that you can watch over and over.  Watchmen is super long, and just OK for me.  Constantine was so so...  All three are watchable of course.",1363305600,,418,4.15
4935158,5,B00634MLIQ,"Constantine the clear cut worst movie of the set, and still worth an occasional watch, but the gems are V for Vendetta and the Watchmen.  I owned V and Constantine already, enjoyed both, but I had them on DVD and with a 1080p TV, BluRay is a much better way to go,  I did not have the Watchmen and only just watched it for the first time.  This movie is not your usual happy super hero movie, it's closer to an extremely dark, and thoroughly adult version of The Incredibles.  You see this movie collecting dust in so many value bins that you question if it's worth watching.  The question shouldn't be whether it's worth watching, but how many times is it worth watching.  It plays out a little obviously for a bit with you feeling like you have the ending guessed at, and then it flops, didn't see it coming, and man, makes sense.  V for Vendetta is another good dark hero movie.  From what I've read, if you loved the graphic novel, you may feel ripped off by the movie, having not any experience with the written version, I greatly enjoyed the movie.  Get this, now, it's worth it if you like one of the movies, it's great if you like two, and for three BluRays at this price, all on their own individual disk, it's a great value.",1363046400,9,1234,4.307359307359308
4935159,5,B00634MLIQ,"I really only got this for V for Vendetta as it is one of my favorite films.

The other two films are also great, and this was a great purchase. It comes in one case with three cleverly placed sleeves. It is no bigger than a regular blu-ray case.",1362960000,,246,4.020408163265306
4935160,3,B00634MLIQ,"All we're missing here is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell, and we'd have the complete set of Hollywood adaptations of Alan Moore's work. I can accept for what they are, Watchmen being my favorite of the three, as just that... Adaptations. V for Vendetta, while it's tone rings true, the order of the events and certain circumstances irks me a little. Eve has a more ""puritan"" introduction, as opposed to her entrance as a first-time prostitute in the novel. She leaves by her own will after she is ""set free"", rather than being pushed out to start the chain of events leading up to her liberation.
Although V is very pretty in it's own right, Watchmen is by far the most visually striking of the three. Due in no small part (zing!)to the frequent ""in your face"" male genitalia close-ups, the camera works decidedly best from far away. Which isn't to say some of the art direction is really amazing, which is a shame because it all could have stretched over a much longer viewing time... maybe two or three films would work out better. I felt as much about V as well in fact, seeing as the story was written in ""acts"".
Constantine is, well, Constantine and aside from the most glaring gripe about the complete 180 their casting director took, although Alan Moore created constantine, he was merely playing second fiddle to his glorious Swamp Thing re-vamp. Seriously though... Keanu? Constantine was modeled after STING. FROM THE POLICE. WHAT THE HELLBLAZER?!!
Ultimately, I feel they stuffed a lot of lazy hollywood tropes into a phenomenal body of work, so even though I enjoy the movies for what they are, it's still a bittersweet purchase.",1362009600,,1662,4.7543252595155705

The movies come on their own disk with special features and all included. They are neatly put together and have their own disk slot, unlike putting all three movies on the same ""disk button"".  I personally like all three of these movies, all of them are action movies but are very different from one another offering good variation in what you get. Not to mention this was only 15 bucks which in my opinion each of these are worth.

Quirky, great performances with an engaging, thought-provoking story.",1353801600,,378,4.8307692307692305
4935190,5,B00634MLIQ,"this is a really great set, you get three comic book movies (all three of which are quite good) they all have special features and all in all it's a great package
first off is the packaging, they put all three discs in a single case, it's compact and the discs are easy to get out so A+ (it also doesn't have any of that ""recycling bullcrap where they take out chunks of the case)
second off the movies themselves,
V for Vendetta: this movie is worth the price of the whole set by itself, it's a combination of an action/suspense thriller that is the highlight of the set. the action is fluid and beautiful, the dialogue is pure poetry, and the foreshadowing has a nice balance of easy to get things and more difficult ones which makes it so that you feel great about catching a tidbit here and there but also makes it even more enjoyable on return viewings where preexisting knowledge lets you catch the subtle foreshadowing.
Watchmen Director's cut: first off props to warner bros for putting the directors cut on here instead of the basic version, it adds a lot of value to this set. this movie is quite good though I must say it was very overhyped but on a second watch it was true to the comic most of the way through and generally was a fun movie.
Constantine: this one came as a complete shock, I had only heard meh reviews for this movie so I didn't have much hope for it going in but honestly it was the high point of the set. it's a great story that's quite interesting, you don't need to have read the comics to understand it, it uses some great cgi (the graphics themselves are actually kind of low quality but the art style that is used with it masks the deficiencies quite well to give a few scenes some beautiful scenery), keanu reeves's emotionless acting actually complements the characters so he doesn't feel out of place, and it's just a fun movie. the only thing I had an issue with is the special features, first off there are quite a few on the constantine dvd second off they are in something closer to VHS quality than they are Blu-ray quality which is really a shame given how interesting some of them actually are.

overall I highly recommend this set, three great movies at a solid price. you can't go wrong with this set.",1352419200,20,2249,4.380382775119617

Overall, I'm so happy with the product itself. V for Vendetta and Watchmen both look FANTASTIC and Constantine looks a lot better than I expected, considering that they had to convert it from what was likely 480p to 1080i.

Watchmen is a excellent graphic novel adaptation that stays very faithful to the original source (except for a tiny part in the end, but it was understandable).
