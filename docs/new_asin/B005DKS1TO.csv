8467152,4,B005DKS1TO,"Both films have pretty good audio/video.  ADH is in full screen while BA is in it's widescreen OAR.  Both films seem to have had their title cards re-done.  In the case of Black Angels, since this was obviously taken from the German DVD of this film, they may have changed it back from a German title to English and didn't have the original card.  There is also a German dubbed trailer for the film, but the film is totally in English with no subtitles.  Angels Die Hard looks like a VHS, but I don't know why they would have changed the title card only to use the same title.",1453420800,,576,4.247706422018348

8467155,3,B005DKS1TO,"Bought to add to my collection. Angles Die Hard, a good ""B"" movie, Black Angels , BAD STORY LINE, BAD ACTING, VERY IMPROBABLE.",1397433600,,126,4.521739130434782
8467156,4,B005DKS1TO,Angels Die Hard is Cheese. I love old biker movies so i can't knock it to hard. Grizzly Adams plays one of the Angels that was a plus. Black angels was awesome. If You like to watch outlaws chase each other around on choppers then this movie is for you.,1370563200,,253,4.08

Angels Die Hard:
Is a very dark copy you need to turn up the brightness on this.
Also the main title was wiped and in it's place the poster title was shown,smartly done but still?
And the part where William Smith is at the cemetery to bury Seed to give his eulogy,the part where he say's 'Brothers' is low volume where at one time it was loud,not anymore.
So yes i was kind of disappointed in this copy of this film,i would still recommend it though because Smith is a bad-ass dude but not all the time,check out those arms.

Black Angels:
Seems to be a pretty cool film i've never seen it before these guys play rough.
If you have ever seen the tv show The UNIT same kind of camera work done,like right in your face.
I was impressed with that.
Has a weird start 2 bikers chasing one another and you don't know why until later when they show you why with the same repeated footage only more of it this time.
This is a fast-paced film it really moves they go through stop signs total disregard for people and not a cop in sight when you want one to make sure the law is obeyed in L.A.,California.
I would recommend this film for sure because of the camera work mainly.",1358380800,4,1252,4.152263374485597
