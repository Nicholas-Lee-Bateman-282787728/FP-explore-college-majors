8054185,3,B0007YUPY0,"Instructional dvd is ok, but not great i could probably have giving a better rating if i had purchased the complete set of instructional dvds. The purchase of 1 fundamental dvd just did not show me enough of the style to give it a better rating. The reputation of the eagle claw style is well known and respected, but the 1 dvd in a set of 12 just did not show me enough to give a better rating.",1511395200,,395,4.076923076923077
