8320971,4,B001MBVCOE,"This review is regarding the Spanish Blu-ray disc, which I've purchased from Amazon Spain. There are some errors in the product listing. This disc is indeed region-free, but it's 50Hz, so some American systems may not be able to display it. The audio is plain Dolby Digital 2.0 for both the English original and the Spanish dub, there is no DTS track whatsoever, never mind what the packaging says. There are also no subtitles, German or otherwise (I notice on Amazon Spain the erroneous listing for German subtitles is also present.)

The picture quality is perhaps the most grainy I've ever seen for a 21st-century production on Blu-ray disc, and looks particularly bad in scenes set at night. That's not to say it's horrible, as the colors are brilliant and the scenes set outdoors look brilliant, with some stylized fast-moving clouds being a recurring image.

On the whole, I found the production rather uneven, with the second half much more interesting than the first. John Simm steals the show as Edward Sexby and is superb.

This is the American edit, which contains two parts of just over 90 minutes each, and is titled on-screen as The Devil's Mistress.",1502841600,,1164,4.8686868686868685

COMPARISON OF U.K. AND EDITED U.S. VERSION INCLUDED BELOW

This historical drama-fiction (called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devils-Mistress/dp/B004AUP3DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devils Mistress</a>(DVD) in the U.S. - streaming version here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Mistress/dp/B00JPL5IZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Mistress</a>) is not the salacious production it has often been ascribed. It is a fictional story set in a very important historical period that will affect modern democracy in both England and the United States. This story is told through a mixture of real and fictional characters and several of those real characters have their relationships changed. The secondary title of this movie is actually ""A true account of the life and times of Angelica Fanshawe"". However, that is stated within the fictional world of this character and is not a literal assertion(see historical notes below for more). Though it is not perfect history, I did appreciate the historical aspects and excellent performances. This show does act as a conduit directing viewers toward further research of a very important period. There is an excellent sequel to this show called New Worlds with Jamie Dornan.

THE STORY (no spoilers): The story opens with the wedding of beautiful Angelica Fanshawe (Andrea Riseborough) to her cousin Harry Fanshawe. As Angelica states ""he inherited the house and she already had the name"" so this is not just a marriage of political convenience. It is a love match. The story quickly backtracks to Angelica and Harry as children since they are life long friends. We see through a series of events that Angelica's Catholic mother departs for France to become a nun, leaving the fatherless Angelica alone. Little Angelica curses God and see's a hallucination or vision of the devil in a tree. The viewer understands later that she told this story to others when she was just a child and it will contribute to why she is later called ""The Devil's Whore"". Back to her new marriage. She has served as a lady in waiting at the court of King Charles I (Peter Capaldi) and looks upon the Charles as her second father. Harry is also a favorite at court and is close friends with mischievous Prince Rupert. Unfortunately, this love match of Harry and Angelica becomes complicated as Harry is not prepared for the naturally passionate but chaste Angelica. Her soft sighs and passionate outburst in sex are misunderstood by the nave Harry who feels she should be completely silent during intimacy. Harry remembers her childish tales of the devil and is even more suspicious. Nevertheless, they are lifelong friends. Soon clouds of civil war will hang over the entire country and test the survival of this couple. One other important character introduced at the wedding is the real Edward Sexby who at this point is still a lowly soldier and mercenary. He admires Angelica, but obviously cannot aspire to such a match. He is assigned by Prince Rupert to serve as retainer to Harry Fanshawe and will follow Angelica in and out of the story as her protector. Through Sexby and Elizabeth Lilburne, Angelica will come to meet Thomas Rainsborough (Michael Fassbender), John Lilburne, and Oliver Cromwell (Dominic West). She is steadfastly supportive of Charles I, but inspired by the free ideals spread by the likes of Lilburne and his wife Elizabeth. Ultimately the coming war will cloud many friendships and test many loyalties. Angelica will be launched on a long journey of survival and redemption set against the depth of change in that era. These are just the opening scenes and set up a much greater story.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The performances in this series really are outstanding and the scenery amazing. The music is more modern sounding and actually cheapens the production a tiny bit, but doesn't ruin it by any means. Excluding the weird visions of the devil (which did serve a purpose), this is actually a very serious production with excellent production values. For Americans, the English Civil Wars are a very under explored topic in history, but are profound in their affect on our modern system of government.

HOW IS THE U.K. EDITION DIFFERENT FROM THE EDITED U.S. VERSION? The U.S. version called ""Devil's Mistress"" instead of the original U.K. ""Devil's Whore"". It is approx. 24 minutes shorter than the U.K. edition. I played both versions side by side to determine just how critical the cuts. Mainly, there are a few scenes shortened, like where the Earl of Manchester commands Lilburne to bow. There is a very brief conversation with the Earl and his commanders before he runs into Lilburne which is not included. Small scenes like a meeting before a certain trial, or a part where a preacher is removed from the pulpit are cut entirely. They add a little to the story, but are not critical and don't even damage the flow very much. There is some editing of nudity and gore. It comes across as a bit token since there is still nudity and there is still bloodshed. And of course there is the change of title to the less sensational ""Mistress"" instead of ""Whore"". That does cause some continuity problems because in the show a character does call her ""The Devil's Whore"". The nudity, as I said, is still there. Instead of seeing a whole female torso, you may see the upper part of the breasts in one scene. The cutaways are just much quicker so there is less nudity and for a shorter number of seconds. The swim scene where Angelica walks out into the pond is cut short so her backside is never shown. As I said, it's really not that sensational and if one is not concerned about the nudity in the shorter version, the longer version is unlikely to offend.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: ANGELICA FANSHAWE is not a real person, but it seems her name was borrowed from the very real Lady Ann Fanshawe who did marry a cousin named Richard. That couple had 10 children and were royalists. They did not have a life anything like depicted in this movie. EDWARD SEXBY served in Cromwell's Roundhead Cavalry Regiment. He worked his way from private to full Colonel through his various military service. It is said he participated in the capture of Charles I at Holdenby House and also raised a foot regiment to serve Cromwell in Ireland. However, he was ordered to Scotland prior to that campaign. He had a fallout with Cromwell over the assumption of Lord Protector and did plan assassination attempts though his emissaries failed. He died in the Tower of London in 1658 (not depicted in this movie). THOMAS RAINSBOROUGH was the son of a Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy. Thomas commanded vessels in the 1st Civil War, but eventually fought in the New Model Army. Thomas was later killed by four royalists in a botched kidnapping attempt, though there were ultimately rumors tracing it back to parliament (and thus Cromwell). JOHN LILBURNE agitated for individual rights and freedom during both the reign of Charles I and the interregnum of Cromwell. He was incarcerated and tried many times. One of his trials (depicted in this show) was even said to have inspired some aspects of our own 5th Amendment to the Constitution. He was the author of The Agreement of the People and other works that may have contributed to aspects of our Constitution. He was friends with Cromwell and fought distinguished battles. His campaign for individual rights ultimately put him in conflict with the Lord Protector. His imprisonment in Mont Orgueil is depicted here, but his end is changed as the final transfer to The Tower is not shown. PRINCE RUPERT OF THE RHINE (close friend of the fictional Harry in this program) was the nephew of Charles I and spent time at English Court, though he was the younger son of German prince Frederick V. Though it was not depicted in this show, he became a preeminent Royalist General in the Civil Wars. His sister was also the mother of King George I of Great Britain.",1430179200,7,8105,5.026785714285714
8320974,4,B001MBVCOE,"First of all, let it be known that the blurb on the back of the DVD case is quite misleading in its attempts to market the product as more racy and spicy than it really is. The protagonist is described as a ""manipulative"" woman who ""exploits a country in crisis in a bid to better her own position"" and ""embraces her sexuality to the shock of her husband"". The tagline is ""in a country torn by war, she was the most dangerous weapon of all.""

From all this you might be mistaken into thinking that ""The Devil's Whore"" is a typical bodice-ripper / faux-historical melodrama, when it fact it is quite a tasteful period piece with a respectable, wholly sympathetic heroine who neither is nor does any of the things the blurb describes. Though there are a few instances in which historical license is taken, there is also a genuine sense of wanting to capture the key events of the English Civil War and integrate the fictional character of Angelica Fanshawe into the proceedings without compromising the authenticity of the piece.

Originally a four-part miniseries, which has here been spread across two discs without any noticeable breaks, ""The Devil's Whore"" alternates between two narratives: the life-story of Angelica Fanshawe (said to have been based on Anne Fanshawe, a memoirist who lived 1625 - 1680) and the English Civil War, following such recognizable figures as King Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Rainsborough, John Lilburne and Edward Sexby. A good balance is maintained between the weighty historical events and Angelica's more glamorous tribulations, and she is incorporated successfully enough into the proceedings that you may find it easy to believe the film's (utterly false) claim that this is the ""true"" story of her life and times.

While still a child, Angelica Fanshawe's mother abandons her in order to become a nun in France, an occurrence that causes young Angelica to reject her faith and thus witness a vision of the devil that reoccurs throughout the series. On reaching womanhood, Angelica is happy enough to marry her childhood sweetheart (and cousin) Harry Fanshawe, but though he loves her dearly, he often feels emasculated by his spirited wife. It's her refusal to be subjugated that lands her husband in hot water with King Charles I, and soon Angelica finds herself negotiating a dangerous world on her own. She ends up rubbing shoulders with the likes of Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Rainsborough, unsure whether she's an ally or an enemy to them, as well as running from a past acquaintance with a vendetta against her. Her ultimate goal is to find a home and safety for herself, and despite the inclusion of no less than three love stories for her, each one has weight and poignancy, and provide Angelica with happiness and grief in equal measure.

Roughly spanning the years from 1638 to 1660 (to be more specific, the historical storyline begins with Charles' embarrassing attempt to arrest members of Parliament in 1642 and ends with Cromwell's death in 1658, though Angelica's story begins and ends slightly before and after these events) the miniseries takes us through the Civil War: the chaotic courtroom trials of ""freeborn"" John Lilburne, the battles between the Cavaliers and Roundheads, the tension between various sects of Catholics and Protestants, the execution of King Charles, and the power vacuum that follows.

It may help if you're familiar with the fundamentals of this time period, but even if you're not entirely sure what's going on, the film moves along briskly and entertainingly, making it easy to enjoy even if you can't follow every aspect. Though there are several deviations from historical record, there are also some nice little touches: the members of the crowd at the king's execution that dab their handkerchiefs in his blood, Charles's famous ""I see my birds have flown"" comment, the moles on Oliver Cromwell's face, and the presence of a poodle when Prince Rupert first appears.

There are some odd glitches: after introducing Prince Rupert, he disappears from the story entirely (perhaps his scenes were cut?) and Angelica's visions of the devil are never explained or elaborated upon, but as is to be expected, the visuals are stunning. Filmed in South Africa (which now bears more of a resemblance to 17th century England than the modern-day England countryside does), the vistas are huge in scope, creating a striking backdrop for elaborate costumes and sets.

The cast is top-notch. Andrea Riseborough (who at times bears an uncanny resemblance to Eva Green) is the high-light, simultaneously strong yet vulnerable, warm yet unattainable, and with an air of otherworldliness that makes it easy to see why she fascinates so many men. Despite the moniker ""devil's whore"" that is ascribed to her throughout the story, it is her name that reveals her true nature: more angel than devil, she carries the film with the help of a strong supporting cast.

Dominic West is a strikingly charismatic and dominating Oliver Cromwell, walking the fine line between sincere idealism and self-justified tyranny, and Michael Fassbender (appearing before his big break in Hollywood) is Thomas Rainsborough, a tragic foil to Cromwell. Peter Capaldi is excellent as usual as King Charles, a gentle-yet-proud man who slowly crumbles over the course of his story-arc, and the likes of Tim McInnerny, Tom Goodman-Hill and Harry Lloyd (whose names may not be familiar, but who pop up everywhere on British television) play small but crucial parts. Also noteworthy is the fact that the wife of John Lilburne (as played by Maxine Peake) is given significant screen-time and development; a worthy addition considering that she was a fascinating figure in her own right, despite often being overshadowed by her famous husband.

Out of all the cast, the portrayal of Edward Sexby is probably most unlike his real-life counterpart (in appearance, personality and biography), but it's hard not to enjoy John Simm's embittered, war-scarred mercenary, a man who initially seems to enjoy bloodshed and who is unmoved by the ideals of those around him, only to gradually embrace a sense of personal conviction, driven almost entirely by his devotion to Angelica.

The American release of ""The Devil's Whore"" goes by the slightly-less provocative title of ""The Devil's Mistress"" (which makes no sense in context), but both the title and the blurb give the impression of a much darker and grimmer viewing experience than it really is. The sex scenes and gore is non-gratuitous, and though there are a couple of attempted rapes, both are thwarted at the last minute. It's impossible to gauge just how sensitive each individual viewer will be when dealing with this material, but don't be put off by the title. ""The Devil's Whore"" is a memorable and enjoyable period-drama, with an intriguing heroine and a story that manages to balance out Angelica's fictional tale with the historical events of the time.",1336003200,19,6953,5.064628820960698
8320975,5,B001MBVCOE,If you love watching the Tudors you will love this DVD. Although the main character does not exist it is still filled with history about the time period. Michael Fassbender is great as usual and if you are a fan of his or the time period you will love watching The Devil's Whore.,1334880000,7,279,4.283018867924528
8320976,4,B001MBVCOE,"The true story of Angelica Fanshawe, they say it is, but that is secondary to the real interest of this mini-series. Born close to the royal court of Charles I, married within that closed sanctuary, closed especially to what other people may think, and particularly repressive with all those that represented some kind of danger for the crown, she was confronted with a time when truth was the master word of everyone, love the premium of every one and yet the everyday reality was sectarianism and violence directed at all those who differed from you, no matter where you stood.

Her story could be reduced to a series of husbands or to a series of man friends or to a series of failures with a successful birth at the end. That's what makes this film striking if not shocking at times with the extreme confrontation of the audience to excessive violence and all other types of executions, corporeal punishments, absolute deprivation of everything, victimization and injustice. And there is not one camp in this full array of differences that is better than the others.

But I think this film goes a long way beyond these details and gritty small impressive elements. First of all it is rather clear on the ""constitutional debate"". The king is of divine nature and has no reason to share his power which is divine and absolute. Parliament, not clearly identified as the representative of the upcoming merchant bourgeoisie whose power was founded on the possession of the merchant fleet, of practically all ships in England, and the control over all sailors, is unable to get out of its small petty meaningless, except for them of course, effete and useless debate on some obtuse religious questions like predestination and the Eucharist, holy sacraments and contact with god, and eventually the right of the people (what people when parliament was elected by a few tens of thousands of propertied people?) to dismiss the king if his connection with the people (what people again.) got discontinued. They were no longer in touch, if they had ever been, with the needs and desires of simple people.

The film insists in fact a lot on the Levelers, those people who defended the idea that the land was the property of those who tilled it and that everyone was supposed to share equally with everyone else. They were hunted by the king's men because they were seen as the most dangerous anti-royal enemies since they wanted the end of monarchy and the shift to an equalitarian republic. On the other side they were equally hunted by Cromwell's supporters because Cromwell was not for a republic, was a direct representative of the mercantile bourgeoisie and was against equal sharing, and yet at the same time he was not for a republic and believed deep in himself this country could only be one-handedly governed by a single man, which he resigned to do himself when no compromise could be found with the king.

The film is absolutely silent, alas, on the various wars in their details: the two civil wars, and then the Irish war and then the Scottish war and then the war with Spain. The first two were against the king and ended with his bodily shortening. The next one was a bloody massacre based on the idea that Catholics had fallen down to lower than animals since they were able to let their own children starve, if not help them a little bit. The Scottish episode is not represented and the Spanish caper is not even mentioned because it confirmed a radical change that had started under Elizabeth I when she had to mobilize the country against Spain. In both cases the Parliament was the key to that demand because the owners of the ships and the employers of the sailors were all directly in parliament or represented in and by parliament. So Elizabeth gave some powers to parliament over taxation for example, in order to get what she wanted: ships and sailors. Cromwell went even further. He had to summon and convene a parliament he had violently disbanded.

Why forget these events that are just coming to the beginning of the end in Ireland, that was solved in Scotland with devolution, and that is the basis of the tremendous move England was able to initiate in the Christian world towards a democratic parliamentary elective system that will take fifty years after the Glorious Revolution (1660) to establish fundamental human rights like Habeas Corpus, the freedom of the press and of publication. That's a shortcoming of great size in the film but that does not prevent us from feeling the happy ending of the Commonwealth in the Glorious Revolution that was to bring a new batch of difficulties and this time the peaceful revocation of the king by parliament in a law that will establish the first constitutional monarchy in the world, a real first step towards the American Revolution and then the French Revolution.

After this period no one could say like Charles I: ""Give me one instance of a king being dismissed by a parliament!"" Charles I was the first in 1649. James II will be the second in 1688. That's really the end of feudalism and its theory of absolute kings by divine appointment.

But nevertheless the show is beautifully filmed and grandiosely performed.

8320977,5,B001MBVCOE,"The moment I saw Charles I, my jaw dropped as I thought he had just stepped from a Van Dyck painting. The costumes and sets are extravagant and tasteful.

Having studied briefly the various religious dissenter groups, I found it fascinating that this mini-series was able to disseminate the philosophies of such groups as the Ranters and the Diggers in a way that was believable and relate-able. Additionally, going back to Charles I, I cannot praise the actor enough for his nuanced portrayal of a tragically flawed king. He was able to evoke sympathy in a character that history has been fond to disdain.

This mini-series is an enjoyable and lavish historical drama that, while taking liberties with history at times, is able to convey what I consider to be the important parts of the religious, cultural, and political themes of the English Civil War.

I wish that this was more widely available. In particular, a US version would be fantastic.",1308960000,12,948,4.875776397515528
8320978,3,B001MBVCOE,"A Mnage  Quatre Drama with brilliant costumes and an impressive assembly of characters. We follow the turmoil of the times of Oliver Cromwell and Charles I through the experiences of Angelica Fanshawe, played by a convincing and beautiful Andrea Riseborough. Through her we get to see many persons and events. From the land owning gentry to the very poor as her fortunes turn. We also get to meet visonaries who look to a better world for all men. Cromwell isn't seen in an admireable light nor is his judgement a positive one, yet neither is he demonised.

The thing about the whole affair is it is rather shallow and underneath everything it has the feel of a decent Category Romance with a high production value for TV but still no masterpiece.

One has the feeling it could have been something more.",1254268800,8,803,4.680851063829787
