3882503,5,B0029Z8K60,"Ghost Hunters blows!!!! Those guys should stick to unclogging toilets!  They seem more interested in doing that than in spending any time investigating paranormal activity.  They're more interested in disproving hauntings than finding anything of significance. And here's a tip, point the camera at something besides yourselves! Maybe you'll find some evidence in the twelve minutes you bother to spend at the sites!  Maybe they just can't handle the lockdown... The Ghost Adventures guys are hilarious and they actually come up with some really compelling evidence that makes you think it could be true.  Can't wait to buy!!!!  (Don't get me started on that ""Scariest Places Ever"" crap...)",1243468800,12,690,5.351851851851852
3882504,5,B0029Z8K60,"I'm sorry, but Ghost Hunters are soooooo boring! All they do is sit around talking, and playing pranks, and they end up getting tired and leaving early. You almost never see anything because the cameras are on them the whole time!

Ghost Adventures are so awesome! They actually get locked inside the places they are investigating ALL night! There are only three of them, and they provoke the spirits and get results. Since I've started watching Ghost Adventures (from the beginning), I have no interest in watching Ghost Hunters .... ever again.",1243123200,21,546,4.934782608695652

3882510,5,B0029Z8K60,"I do like ""Ghost Adventures"" especially when they first approach their lockdown destination. Zak Bagan, Nick Groff and Aaron Goodwin travel together to some allegedly haunted destinations. In their first season, there are only eight episodes on two DVDs. There is also a deleted scenes from every episode, scariest moments from every episode, Zak's gear guide and trailers.

I do enjoy the threesome visit locations like Moundsville Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia; Bob Mackey's Music World in Wilder, Kentucky; Houghton Mansion in North Adams, Massachusetts; Riddle House in West Palm Beach, Florida; Sloss Furnace in Birmingham, Alabama; a former psychiatric hospital in Northern New Jersey (the hospital is located on 90 acres and is unnamed); South Bridge Vaults in Edinburgh, Scotland (it's sole abroad location) and Old Idaho Penitentiary in Boise, Idaho.

I really enjoyed learning about the histories of all these places as well as learning about them. I enjoyed the special features as well. I don't want to be in their place especially when they do about a 12 hour lockdown in the darkness of night. They do deliver some evidence to back their claims for an afterlife.",1484438400,,1189,5.252631578947368

3882530,5,B0029Z8K60,"With the humble beginnings for the Ghost Adventures series, season 1 contains the 8 initial lockdowns of the show. Ghost Adventures proves to be a refreshing take on a stale genre of reality television. Here we take a look back at where one of the most followed Travel Channel shows got it's start.

During this early stage of the show, the GAC often stuck to the basics of ""ghost hunting"", using mostly digital thermometers, EMF detectors, EVP recorders, and infrared digital cameras. We learn early on that lead investigator Zak likes to use provocation to draw out spirit activity. He claims this is directed only towards malevolent entities that are said to bully the living, which seem to be among his favorite to investigate. Fellow investigator Nick is more reserved, but often can vouch for many of the things Zak claims to experience on their investigations, and sometimes has some personal encounters of his own. The equipment tech / investigator Aaron, is the most timid of the crew, and is often shown freaking out during the more unnerving moments. It becomes a trend for the crew to leave him in solitude in attempt to communicate with spirits, as he is seen as the most vulnerable ""bait"" under certain conditions.

In season 1, the crew investigate several creepy locations with dark histories including two former prisons, a former slaughter house, a haunted mansion, some civil war era structures, some underground caverns, and perhaps the most creepy location being an undisclosed abandon psychiatric hospital. The crew provides each with a rich backstory on location, often interviewing care takers and historians who know a lot of factual information about each place, before hearing some eyewitnesses ghostly encounters. Some eyewitnesses seem credible, others not so much. It's hard to say who is being honest, and who is simply fabricating stories to generate a buzz.

My favorite investigation in this season was the psychiatric hospital. The place looked creepy enough in the day time, I can only imagine what it was like in pitch darkness. Some of the evidence gathered at this location was compelling, and pretty disturbing. Evidence such as disembodied voices, and clear unmistakable shadow figures showing up under infrared light. Other lockdowns on this season that I found interesting were Riddle House, Houghton Mansion, and the Edinburgh caverns, all producing their share of unexplained phenomena.

Individual ratings of each episode:

- Moundsville State Penitentiary - 3 / 5
- Bobby Mackey's Music World - 2 / 5
- Houghton Mansion - 4 / 5
- Riddle House - 4 / 5
- Sloss Furnace - 3 / 5
- Former Psychiatric Hospital - 5 / 5
- Edinburgh Vaults - 4 / 5
- Old Idaho Penitentiary 2 / 5

Short, but entertaining. This season is essential to getting acquainted with the crew and their methods. Unfortunately, the publisher of this DVD, Image Entertainment, ceased production of the 2-DVD set around 2014 or so, making this a hard to come by collection. I believe you can still purchase the episodes as a download, but you'll probably have trouble finding the DVD. All subsequent seasons have been published by Giam Entertainment, so they should remain unaffected by this.",1443571200,,3201,4.973831775700934

I don't like that they used psychics or that weird husband and wife team of ""experts"" to analyse the data.  Zak looks pretty skinny and they all look much younger.  Also I found that they were really reaching when claiming that the EVPs captured voices.

Even if you don't believe in ghosts this is a good show just because they get to travel around in old buildings and learn the dark history of them. I used to watch this show religiously but not so much anymore. Zak kind of annoys me...",1380672000,,342,4.359375
3882569,4,B0029Z8K60,"Allow me to preface this by saying I do not believe in ghosts, goblins, demons, or things that go bump in the night. I do however find Ghost Adventures and similar shows to be highly entertaining and some of the best reality TV has to offer. I like the historical background, meeting the people involved, the investigations in the dark, and the reactions the people have to what they see.

Since the conception of Reality TV in the late 90s, we have seen a ton of these ghost hunting shows debut. We have Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State, Destination Truth, Ghost Mine, Celebrity Ghost Stories, and of course Ghost Adventures, but what is it that makes one show any different or better than the other?

Ghost Adventures is the one that I enjoy the most and if I were a believer, it's the show that I would find to be the most compelling. Simply put, the ghost adventures team, goes to the best locations and captures more evidence than any one else does, so what does that mean? As I see it, it means one of two things. Either these guys really are the best at what they do or they are completely full of !@#$.

The Ghost Adventures team is made of three guys, who claim to have been skeptics, until they witnessed things they couldn't explain. These three guys, without big crews, go into these haunted locations with camcorders, and are locked in overnight. To me that is the best part of the show, because in similar shows, you have dozens of people stomping around finding nothing and trying to disprove what people are saying. Zak, Nick, & Aaron aren't trying to do that, but rather they want to interact with whatever is going on in these locations and try to capture it on film. Is that the reason they capture more evidence? Is it the fact that it's just three guys with a minimal amount of equipment? I have no idea, all I know is that they find the most stuff!

In recent years, almost every other ghost hunting show has had someone speak out against them and say that certain things were faked, the people were paid or coaxed into saying things that weren't true, but in the seven years that Ghost Adventures has been on the air that hasn't happened to them.

So besides the evidence, what is it that makes this show the best? Well, you've got three young guys, who are ambitions, full of energy, and love what they do. The format of the show is also a big plus in their favor.

Each show starts out with a historical background on the location they are going to investigate. That's followed by interviews with the people who live or work at the location. The team walks through with the people, listening to their stories, and marking down locations to investigate later. Then they move on to some extra-curricular activity that shows the audience that they're real people. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's just tourists, and other times it's boys being boys. It seems like filler, but actually these segments really help you connect with the guys and see that they aren't just science geeks sitting in front of their camera all day. Next, comes the investigation, which is done in a way that is completely realistic. If a regular person went into a place that they heard was haunted, and they went in with a camera and a tape recorder, they'd act and react in exactly the same way that these guys do. It adds realism to the show and is much more believable then a show that comes in with a giant truck and a ton of equipment.

The one negative I will put on the show is that these three guys just went out and started doing videos, pitched it to a network, and got a TV show. They aren't scholars or scientists who have studied the phenomenon of haunting for decades. That being said, when they start going on about portals, residual spiritual energy, trapped souls, and demonic stuff, they really do sound like they are completely full of !@#%.

Overall, I like the show, I love the format, and while I think there is some kind of trick to it all, I respect the hosts and how they feel about what they are supposedly seeing. Weather you believe in ghosts or not, the Ghost Adventures team gives a more compelling argument for life after death than any of it's competitors. The show is interesting and very entertaining, that's really all I need to watch it. I don't feel like I have to believe or think the same way they do. They aren't preaching to us like some of the other shows and they aren't talking down to us. They just go and do their thing, while taking us along for the ride and it's most definitely an entertaining one.",1380412800,,4548,4.477683956574186

They had no money and then they got sponsors. ScyFy channel let them go and I bet they are regretting it now. They are on Travelchannel. I don't care what anyone says. They have good evidence. There are some things that people are trying to discount them. But Zak is a good guy. He has really tried to get good equipment and make it more affirmative. I love the EMF detector that measures electrical energy. The ghost can make the machine go off and on. The demons are very scary. Zak has a demon and girl spirit in his house. Lots of crazy things happen in his house.",1352592000,,706,4.160583941605839

They just get better and better with each passing episode.  I find myself getting the shivers at some of the EVPs they collect and the rare video evidence.  I also really like how they focus on trying to get the evidence and not just them being filmed trying to get the evidence and not really show it.  I've already purchased season two and looking forward to buying the other seasons.",1350864000,,533,4.343434343434343
3882604,5,B0029Z8K60,"This show is amazing to say the least. I prefer it to Ghost Hunters & GHI for so many reasons! 1. There are only 3 people in the locations at a time..when someone stays in a room alone they're actually alone..& they set up camera all over the room they're alone in to not only see what they might capture but it proves that no one is there. 2. They go about things like EVP sessions better..do more then just say ""hellow?"" a bunch of times & give more time inbetween each question for an answer normally. 3. They only use flashlights in emergancy situations & etc.. 4. They provoke to get responces & it proves to work. 5. They take their evadence to other professionals & etc.. and often they find more that the Ghost Adventures team realizes is there. 6. I personally enjoy that they let you hear the EVP's at the time they pick them up (even if they didn't hear them at the time) as apose to waiting 'till the end of the show to reaveal most of it..it seems to keep you more interested in the investigations because if you stop paying attention there's a good chance you'll miss it completly. 7. They do things like make sure the camera is able to see the EMF dector so when they catch things like EVPs & etc.. it has more cred. (they do the same thing with other items too like motion detectors & etc..)

I could go on but for who ever is reading and maybe trying to decide if this is worth buying..I can assure you, it's worth whatever you end up spending on it! For example I just finished watching Ghost Hunters Season 7 Part 1 & with in the first 2 episoded of Ghost Adventures Season 1 they find more/expeirance more physical prove (being scratched, etc..) then GH did their whole s7 v1! (and I stupidly paied $15 for GH s7 v1..and I got GA s1 for only $10! I'd be willing to pay $20 for this particular season.)",1345075200,,1821,4.247838616714698

First we get to see the history of the place they are at and learn why a ghost might be still hanging around. After the first show, I was hooked!

3882620,3,B0029Z8K60,"I love this show for a number of reasons.  With that said, there are certain things about it that I don't like.  First, Zak is such a drama queen!!! OMGosh!  Get real.  He can be hard to watch sometimes because he can be so annoying.  He is rude sometimes and seemingly starved for attention. Secondly, the use of profanity is over the top.  Lots of people swear, but they do it almost constantly.  So you're constantly hearing the beeps.  That behavior is unprofessional and unnecessary.  The focus should be on the paranormal, not the filthy language.  It also seems like Aaron is often mistreated - not because of usually being the bait, but rather because he doesn't seem to receive due respect from Nick and Zak.  That's just my meaningless observation.  I find some of the alleged evidence to be quite questionable.  On one episode, not sure from what season, it appeared that Aaron struck a metal structure with his left hand and then started the usually, ""Oh my god dude!!!!""  I watched this clip in slow motion, and did appear this may have been as I said.  I can't say that for sure, however.  I don't know of any other paranormal team that gets that much evidence at any given place. Therefore, I take the show very lightly.  On the other hand, I do love the show despite its flaws.  It is great that the GAC is enthusiastic about what it is doing.  This is the only show of its kind that doesn't bore me to tears.  This isn't just a bunch of people walking through a dark building shining a flashlight around.  The crew actually does a thorough investigation.  Some of the other popular investigators seem to walk around for a little while, and then just leave.  I've even some of them get a good class A EVP, and then just walk away without attempting to further the conversation.  That's irresponsible in my opinion.  So, the show is good and bad.  Again, this is just my opinion and doesn't really count for much.  Hope this helps.",1308182400,3,1946,4.517241379310345
3882621,1,B0029Z8K60,"I am very interested in the paranormal and ghost hunting, but these guys are morons, in one episode they leave one guy locked in a morgue refrigerator for more than an hour, while the rest of the team explored elsewhere, a real team would have NEVER put one of their own in possible life-threatening danger, that guy could have died and then the team could not find their way back to him.  The leader of the team is always provoking entities, and if they really knew what they were doing, they would understand that only works some of the time. I have only seen one positive - they research the site well, with talking to former employees, inmates, etc. I really believe these guys saw the success of ""Ghost Hunters"" and wanted a piece of the pie, wanted their own tv show, well they got it but unfortunately suck at it, my advice to ghost adventure - don't quit your day job at Mcdonalds.",1308096000,3,889,4.420731707317073
3882622,4,B0029Z8K60,"One thing about this show that I like more than Ghost Hunters is that they're more open about how they feel and they leave their political commentary out of the narratives. Zak, Nick and Aaron make me want to do ghost hunting on my own. They make it seem fun.

However, when I purchase a DVD from a censored TV show, I expect it not to be censored. If it is, I might as well just DVR all the episodes with the commercials and the bleeps and watch it like that. I almost want to mail it back because of it.

The Travel Channel will definitely be hearing from me. They at least need to tell people that these shows are still censored. That they hide this information is extremely deceptive. When I pay for a DVD, I want it ""as is"", with no bleeps or any other censorship. If I don't like the language, I don't have to purchase the product in the first place.

The Travel Channel put out the DVDs for Most Haunted, but those aren't censored, so what's the deal this time? The second DVD I purchased is from a different ""manufacturer"", so I'm hoping it's not the same.

They did not set up cameras in the main areas of activity.....the board on the stairs....the flag....etc. The EVP they caught was dubious at best with no cleaning up the sound or trying to debunk it and the idiots jumped at every little noise thinking they had a ghost at every turn.  At one point they even had some coats moving on their own but they were too scared to notice it and take the time to figure out what was going on.

The main host is a puffed up putz who lacks any professionalism whatsoever....the camera man is a pathetic coward and the only one with a brain in his head is Nick and he doesn't seem to get as much camera time as his narcissistic camera hog partner does. Nick would make a better host than Zack because he at least kept his wits about him and seems to want to figure out what is going on.  The haphazard way that this show was put together just smacks of a high school production. Don't waste your money or time. My kids could put together a better show than these weenies.",1305158400,2,1180,4.278026905829597

This isn't a big deal, unless you have lost or damaged your DVD remote control, which requires you to watch it on your PC.

Good material,from what I think are the best guys in the business, although I enjoy other ""ghost"" shows, these guys use gadgets that nobody else has to communicate with ""whatever"" is behind those disembodied voices.

Plus Ya can pretty much tell what is going to happen in their show, Zak will go ""Show yourself (Spirits name), I'm not afraid of you, you coward!"" then a couple seconds later one of them will have the deer in the headlight looks and say ""DUDE!"" did you hear that?!?!?"" and followed by a EVP (Electronic voice phenomenon) that in general is horrible. This show is pretty much a insult to the Paranormal field! If you want to see a show that is a true Paranormal show then I would suggest Ghost Hunters or Ghost Lab. Ghost Adventures is not worth wasting your hard earn money on! Just go and get Ghost Hunters or Ghost Lab. Heck even Scoby Doo is better then Ghost Adventures!",1300406400,4,876,4.380368098159509

I actually bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my mother (I also purchased Ghost Adventures: The Beginning && Ghost Adventures: Season Two for her). I was disappointed when we sat down to watch this DVD && the profanity was still bleeped out. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I feel the need to hear Zach drop an F-bomb every time he's frightened (which is often), but I do feel a bit ripped off when I'm paying money for a DVD that claims to be unrated && I have to verify that I'm over 17 years old to purchase, && the profane language is still bleeped like I'm viewing it on the Travel Channel. && btw, the Travel Channels TV warning is only for children 14 && under.

Besides all of that, it was a great purchase. Buying this && the other Ghost Adventures DVD's opened up so much room on my mothers DVR (she saved every single GA episode), && it made her smile on Christmas morning. So, if u can overlook paying money for a show u can watch for free on ur cable channel, then go for it. Otherwise, just stick to GA: The Beginning...it's truly UR && worth every penny u spend to see Zach run, screaming into the darkness.",1298851200,5,1256,4.277310924369748
3882630,3,B0029Z8K60,"I'm not a believer in the paranormal, but I love a good ghost story. I enjoy getting goosebumps watching movies like ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""The Grudge"".

""Ghost Adventures"" is a fun show...even if you don't believe, simply because of Zak Bagans and his crew. If I were going to make a B-movie about ghost hunting I would most likely pick someone just like the former wedding DJ to star.
Bagans simply doesn't care that he comes off goofy or corny at times when he's trying to ""provoke"" some spirits. You can't help but get caught up in the action, and even though I don't believe...watching Bagans and his crew do their thing really makes me want to believe. And I think that's where ""Ghost Adventures"" succeeds and similar shows fail.

The better known ""Ghost Hunters"" is basically the same show every week, and it seems that more often than not, you end us wasting an hour watching those guys wander through dark hallways with little to no payoff at all.
Zak and his crew seem to capture quite a bit more ghost action on their show. And even if they don't, you still get to enjoy Bagans and his over the top hunting techniques.

Another aspect of the show that I really enjoy over similar programs is that any ""evidence"" captured on either film or audio recordings is played during the course of the ""investigation"". Meaning that if they catch something on film or catch a voice on one of their recorders, you get to hear it, or see it, right away as opposed to waiting until the final minutes of the show.

To top it off, I love that the first half of each show is an in depth look at the locations being investigated. As a history buff, you have to love when the crew takes learns the history (usually violent) of places like the Sloss Furnace or the Idaho Penitentiary.

So if you want some fun goosebump raising entertainment, that at times can be corny as well as a little spooky, I recommend you give this show a try.",1297814400,8,1928,4.465909090909091
3882631,1,B0029Z8K60,"I recently bought this ""NOT RATED"" season 1 of ""Ghost Adventures"" and it came to be a real disappointment. The DVD is not rated, one would think that the bleeps would be left out. If you do not want to hear the bleeps and want to hear the swear words do not buy this video.
Would anyone know where I can purchase this video that leave the bleeps out? The show itself is a good show and watch all the time but I will not buy any further DVDS of ""Ghost Adventures"" until such time when I know I will be able to hear the swear words. I want to hear in full what the crew is saying to the spirits that react the way they do. Great show but disappointment when it comes to buying the DVDS.

Only it is Zak that does the provoking and the narration of the show. He truly makes the show stand out with his enthusiasm and excitement for the paranormal. He draws you in and makes you feel like you are there with them in each scary place they visit. Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters, could use a Zak on their show. The first time I watched this it drew me in within the first 5 seconds I watched it. All three guys are great with some good humor thrown in for additional entertainment.

I mean they intend to find something when they go ghost hunting. They also have a good sense of humor at times and make it fun to watch their show. They really make you wish you could go ghost hunting with them. I intend to buy the other seasons as well. Highly recomended.",1288656000,,582,4.3

I have an interest in the genre and I will catch other titles when they are on, but not before GA have I been a follower of any particular series. Most of the reviews you will read about this title will point out the amateurish and somewhat clumsy way these three men go about their investigations and that is part of the charm in my opinion. They aren't dry scientist or analytical types that turn everything into a laboratory experiment, yet they do use professional grade equipment. Zak's brash style can be hard to accept at first but he does eventually grow on you and if he doesn't you may learn to at least appreciate him for who he is (or portrays) despite. The three of them have a sort of genuine quality about them that makes them fun to watch as they go through all these ""exotic"" locations. Yes, they try to add some drama, yes there is a musical score of creepy music, yes there are bumpers with sound effects and contrived scary scenes but it is TV after all. They will also add just a bit about themselves and their personal lives in certain episodes that will make you think perhaps this is more then just fun and games and maybe catching a ghost on film, but that their private lives (Aaron's particularly) may have suffered because of it. The evidence they catch is compelling and believable, yet sometimes I wonder why they are so ""lucky."" Would anyone over a 12 hour period and a digital voice recorder and a couple of night vision cameras ALWAYS come up with enough evidence to make a 1 hour episode compelling to watch? Maybe ghosts DO respond to Zak's antagonistic behavior.",1287619200,,1737,4.482649842271293

I thought the team was obnoxious and difficult to watch at first, but then I watched their 2004 Documentary movie(I'm not sure if Amazon sells this or not). This Documentary was so well put together and entertaining, that their TV show Ghost Adventures seems much better as I have new found respect for the GA Team. Zak, Nick and Aaron do wonderful job with their investigations and you don't have to wait for the end of the show to learn their findings. As things happen, they pause the episode and insert replays and soundbites as needed. Buy this DVD because it is priced right and excellent, both seasons are great, the more you watch the more the show grows on you.

3882638,5,B0029Z8K60,"I confess, I am completely addicted to this show.  I'll watch the same episodes over and over again on The Travel Channel, I never get sick of them.  I just ordered Season One, and it's on its way... and I also pre-ordered Season 2, of course.  DUH!!  LOL.  Anyways this show is extremely entertaining.  Not only do the investigators gather incredible evidence once dusk hits and it's time for ""lock-down"" ... but they are an absolute HOOT to watch once their adventure begins.  MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!

Zak Bagans has definitely found his calling by doing what he does.  This field has needed a NO BS, NO NONSENSE, tough, in-your-face type of investigator for a long, LONG time... so Zak's been a long time coming!!  He's so funny to watch, because you can just tell he's like a little kid in a candy shop practically drooling when the owner or keeper gives him the tour and the run-down on the site, paranormal activity, experiences, stories, and the history behind each location, etc, etc;--which is just as fascinating in itself.  He completely cracks me up because he ALWAYS tackles and taunts the 'evil' and most aggressive entities at the site, and basically tells them who's boss.  He asks and demands that they try to pull the same stuff that they have pulled on other people.  He's persistent, and extremely passionate about this, and it makes you wanna' back him up 100 percent!  But the laughs will still be there, of course, LOL!

Nick, the second investigator is the more 'smooth and suave' type... but he relentlessly follows Zak's orders and pretty much always gets the job done, which is what these guys are just trying to do.  Get in, get the evidence they need, and get the H*LL outta' there--ALIVE!!  Nick gets just as frightened and scared as the other two, though, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.

Aaron, the camera-man is a total TRIP to watch beause he is definitely the most vulnerable and frightened of the group.  The entities feed off of people's fear, and they loooove to mess with Aaron, hehehe.  Zak and Nick undoubtedly know this because they usually use Aaron as ""the bait""... making him do some of the scariest and craziest experiments during the lockdown.  But Hey. Somebody's gotta' do the dirty work, right??? LOL!

All in all this has got to be the best paranormal research show out there today, and I really hope these guys continue to do what they're doing for a very long, long time.  And they are ARE professional in what they do.  They're real people just like the rest of us, yanno.  They become terrified, run for their lives, scream and yell, and they are not afraid to show it.  I see nothing wrong with paranormal investigators having a little bit of personality... and these guys have a PLENTY of it, lol, which is quite refreshing.  They're like 3 little kids going through a Haunted House on Halloween night, LULZ.  Their reactions are genuine and yes, HI-larious at the same time.  You can bet that if I was doing this stuff in front of millions of viewers on TV, I would give them a run for their money, too! The only one who really overreacts is Aaron--no surprise.  Still--it's genuine overreactions.  They show us just how REAL this field is... and their techniques work, because they get lots of activity and evidence recorded.  I don't think I've ever seen a show where they haven't collected or experienced any activity.  So whatever they're doing--it's working!  Bottom line:  They get the job done, and they've shined a whole new light on paranormal studies.  They are cleary passionate in what they do, and it shows.  You get caught up in the adventure right along with them!

I call these guys ""The Real-Life Ghostbusters"" because once again, they really mean business, and let the entities know it, too (which of course, the entities do not like).  They are a no BS, no nonsense group of investigators who get the job done and get it done right, IMO.  It's also so funny to watch them get on eachother's nerves, too... yelling at eachother, telling eachother to shut-up, calm down, telling the other one to go do something because ""they ain't doing it"", etc, etc, etc.  LMAO--these guys are totally like The 3 Stooges of this field.  Completely genuine and completely entertaining together.

Anyways.  What else can I say besides--MOVE OVER ""Ghost Hunters"" (pppppffffffffffff)--there's a new sheriff in town!  Zak and his crew!!  They are here to kick GHOST-BUTT!!!

3882651,2,B0029Z8K60,"This show is good for entertainment value (in small doses).  I admit I watch it, which is why I gave it two stars.  Zak and friends are quite rude and obnoxious and grate on the nerves after awhile, and the lock-down think seems rather immature.  Their evidence is also a bit too convenient.  Ghosts always do what they want no matter how rudely they treat them, not to mention, every place seems to turn up great evidence.  They also seem to accept every orb and matrix as a ghost, as well as, every bump or bang.  It's also amusing how when they go to places already visited by TAPS, the owners still try to pawn off events as paranormal that TAPS clearly debunked.

Overall, if you want to be entertained by three guys who look like fools scaring themselves, then this is the show to watch.  If you want researchers acting professionally and objectively, watch Ghosthunters.

PS:  I've had a variety of paranormal experiences, including having a hand on my shoulder.  And, like on Ghosthunters, none of them were scary; and I'm definitely no big, bad, tough guy.",1272585600,5,1065,4.611702127659575

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

Ghost Adventures is also an interesting show. Less scientific evidence though. I'd like to see more. The EVPs are not always that impressive. Good show though.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

Zak comes across as a bit of a poser sometimes and all 3 seem to spook pretty easily (Zak screams like a little girl if he really gets jarred), but the show is very entertaining in part because of their personalities.  Their methods are similar to GH (they do try a couple new things), but they don't hold the evidence to the end- when they encounter something they show you.

3882663,5,B0029Z8K60,"Typing Fast Here..

At first after seeing Ghost Adventures in action i thought Zack and his team were soft of goofs... and they are somewhat, but to me they are way more into what they do and it naturally shows... and they are not afraid to push the envelope and try different things like provocation, props, etc which in many ways makes sense.  I just get more of a sense of passion about what they are doing and they seem to do more ground work with the equipment they have and only three people considering TAPS has more people and seems to capture less consistently.

The other thing is that TAPS seems to just move on when things get good and spicey and Zack/Nick/Aaron keep pushing to the brink when things heat up...

Ghost hunters doesn't seem to spend as much time investigating as Ghost Adventures and even when they do find things there is no real excitement or acknowledgement of what they found...

They like debunking and that's good but some of their debunks are purely obvious speculation with little more ground than the original myth.

I also love the Zack's history approach before the investigation that Ghost Adventures has.  Lots of historic information from a variety of people/perspectives... I think it does allot of building up.  I love Zack's walking the neighborhood and asking people...

Again they just seem to really be into what they are doing.

Ghost Hunters while trying to operate from 100% objectivity in many ways actually restrict their investigative creativity because of this.  I mean face it your hunting ghosts and while your trying to tell a true and accurete story... sometimes its like Walter Cronkite in news... fantastic objectivity but boring as hell to watch and very little insight for those of us not in the know, and this is fine but when you have flashlights coming on and off and doors opening and closing with no reason... Cronkite style does little to emphasize the gravity of the moment.. or attempt to take it to the next level of understanding.

Bottom Line Go Zack/Nick and Aaron(My girls love Aaron... he's like a real life Shaggy From Scooby Do when he's investigating...) You guys are raw and into it... and we love it.",1262217600,2,2182,4.728232189973615

The Ghost Adventures crew, the surprising handsome Zack, stoic Nick, and lovable scaredy cat Aaron quickly won me over after a few episodes.

3882667,3,B0029Z8K60,"I do love the enthusiasm of this show, that I have no doubt. As a first season release (which I purchased last month from Amazon) I think they've dug up enough amazing evidence that I feel it's credible enough to warrant buying the other seasons when they're released on DVD. I've also recommended the show to many people who are into the paranormal. Please do the same.

What I really find hard to deal with is Zak talking over the top of Nick and Aaron during investigations telling them to shut up, he could do well doing that himself. Actually they could all talk a little less. I find this quite off putting and hope in the new seasons this has stopped or at least slowed toned down the chatter. I seemed to have spent a great deal of time turning down the sound when they got into his taunts of Spirits. I feel where Ghost Hunters excels and Ghost Adventures does not (again I'm talking first season here) is that they give a lot of space for things to happen and you don't find them talking through the whole event which means they can capture more. Grant and Jason are actually quite sympathetic to their environment which makes the show extremely enjoyable to watch.

In short I wouldn't miss a season of this show because they do rock! It would be awesome if they spent more time listening instead of talking but I'm being critical and also realize watching it from the comfort of my lounge is damn easy. It's also easy to dismiss how scary that environment must be when you're just a remote control warrior.

Long live the brave people from Ghost Hunters, GH International, Paranormal State and the mighty Ghost Adventure crew who go out there to find answers. I have much respect for people who do things like this as they do risk their wellbeing. I feel we are here on this earth to quench our curiosity and these people are brave enough to do it for us.

I witness and chased a ghost many years ago which walked down 3 fights of steps in my building where I lived. When I caught up to it, it disappeared around the corner. It looked as solid as you and I. I chased it because I thought it had stolen something from my flat.

3882669,2,B0029Z8K60,"I purchased one episode of this show to see if it would be as entertaining as Ghost Hunters. As I feared, it is not. The narration is stilted and unnatural, the language is dude-crude and there doesn't seem to be even a  pretense at ""scientific"" examination of the situation. Just a bunch of little boys having fun in the dark, in my opinion.",1258416000,2,342,4.428571428571429

Not as many episodes as I thought, I think they could do without the bleeps when they curse. I also would have liked to see the two-hour documentary that started the whole show.

I was excited when I heard about a new show that consisted of people hunting for answers..and ghosts. But from the first episode I think its a total joke. THEY NO NOTHING ABOUT GHOST HUNTING AND TAKE EVERYTHING AS EVIDENCE. They go into a place thinking its haunted. So when something does happen, they just go ahead and count the place as haunted.

Their enthusiasm for the investigations and finding what is really out there is entertaining.
Zak's aggressive approach to stir up emotional energy is quite successful at times.
Some of the episodes have some hard proof of paranormal activity - I find them very interesting, but it's my field of passion/study also.",1254614400,28,500,5.2625

( a pet hate from other ghost investigation shows).

As with any ""ghost"" show, you have to take it with a grain of salt; but it is extremely interesting and some of the footage they get will send chills down your spine!

Another person commented on how many times they say ""Dude"" and ""Bro."" I've also noticed and embraced this. My friends and I now place the Dude/Bro drinking game - every time they say one of these, DRINK!

In all honesty it is an awesome show. Even if you don't believe, just visiting the locations and getting the background information with them is worth watching.

The Season 1 price is a steal. You should definitely get it!",1253404800,6,752,4.474452554744525

I also love how they are willing to try new things like all different types of equipment and new ways to communicate with the spirits. I can't wait for season 2!!!!,1252800000,7,431,4.76
3882678,5,B0029Z8K60,"I used to be a diehard Ghost Hunters fan.  Well, now that Ghost Hunters are boring, aging, and faking evidence, I got interested again in watching Ghost Adventures.  What these three guys achieve as far as REAL evidence, energetic film making, and giving us a more satisfying back story to each haunted location, is far above and beyond what Ghost Hunters is dredging out these days.  I like the way Zak provokes ""only the bad entities"" and ultimately gets results.  Their reactions to their interactions with the spirit world are genuine and fun to watch.  These guys are the real deal and unlike GH, they scream and run sometimes, and you know what?  So would I!!!  That's why I love them.  I love that they take more time to show us the history of the locations and they are very respectful of the people they interview.  It just adds so much more to the show and to our experience.  Try not to be moved by ""Redbone"", the ex-inmate of Moundsville Penitentiary, who couldn't wait to take the boys on a tour of the prison after over 20 years of freedom from its walls, only to have to leave in tears when visiting his best friend's cell and recalling the day of his friend's murder in that very cell.  VERY touching stuff.  Zak, Aaron, and Nick love what they do and it shows.  The episodes are sufficiently creepy and amazing in the evidence they produce.  You will not be disappointed.",1252800000,89,1388,4.522088353413655
3882679,5,B0029Z8K60,"I'm glad that Zak, Nick and Aaron are truly sincere in their efforts in documenting the paranornal.  Unlike the other so called paranormal shows on tv that have the cameras on themselves the whole time how will they catch anything on film doing that? I give 5 stars for the show zero for the dvd.  My first copy on the first disc stopped brifely on the last show ""Riddle House""  after the clothes on the coat rack move then played thur.  Second disc play fine until the last show ""Old Idaho Penitentiary in the rose garden when Zak  and Aaron were to take pictures of orbs, it compleley stops playing.  I contacted Amazon.com and they sent out another dvd of Ghost Adventures season 1 free of charge.  Well the same thing happened on the replacement in the same areas.  I know it's not my dvd player because I played ""The Shining"" last weekend and no problems with the dics or dvd player. I'm suprised no one has reported any problems with this dvd set.  I'm glad Amazon has pulled this dvd set for review.  I believe this dvd set in cheaply made and or a bad batch sold to Amazon.  Would like to see this problem resloved.

3882681,4,B0029Z8K60,"I started watching this show after watching Ghost Hunters. I can tell you that it is better than Ghost Hunters and many of the things these guys do is dangerous. They actually focus cameras and the such down hallways in hopes of catching a ghost on film instead of filming their faces the whole time. The reactions that the hosts give when they are scared or in pain seem very genuine, even screaming and running sometimes. They deal a lot with demonic spirits while taunting to bring on activity. They are scratched many times and freak out a lot. But hey, they do catch a lot of good evidence. The only downside (minor downside) is that they are sometimes too fast to say something is a ghost, such as a distorted evp and orbs. Yet most of the evidence is very good.

But after only two episodes I could not stand to watch it any more.  The group of ""hunters"" (esp. ZACK) are so overly dramatic it comes across as really BAD acting. They are w-a-y too hyperactive, and insist on using extreme provoking (read that ""BULLING"") the ghost/entity they are trying to communicate with. I would enjoy the show IF the producers could find people with a more laid back personality and a more level headed approach to their ""hunting"".",1246924800,17,568,4.855670103092783

But im more into Ghost adv and paranormal state though two are my faves. I find them real, and they find stuff. I have to admit I have met ghost hunters in real life and they are very polite. But I hate Most haunted >< they are fake and it has been said they act which you can tell when you watch the show. And their protocol is bad (if you watch the show you will know this) every one knows that you partner up when ghost hunting or have some sort of communication. They do neither they tell someone stupid girl or guy go down that spooky path by them selves and look for something then while they are there they flip out!

period of time, just 2 days later then the original date which would've been Monday & much quicker than anticipated,
 which is great in my book.
With that said, it's an awesome 2 disc DVD set, & something that I can enjoy from time to time, without having to DVR.
