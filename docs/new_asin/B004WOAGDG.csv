love that little girl and the boy, both of them are so cute.",1393372800,,251,3.7547169811320753
8445455,5,B004WOAGDG,"Get ready for a lot of singing and whimsy.  My kids loved this movie, it's an adventure that is very family friendly and totally fun to watch for all!",1392681600,,150,4.172413793103448
8445456,4,B004WOAGDG,"This is one of those movies that was originally filmed in another language (non-English) and then over-dubbed with English dialogue.  It is full of kooky songs that are slightly outside the norm.  But my kids (2 and 3 years old) love the movie.  It has a great fun energy, and is very innocent.  We liked it enough that when it went out of rotation on netflix, we ordered this DVD to have around.  Would recommend.",1381017600,,414,4.466666666666667
8445457,5,B004WOAGDG,Love this movie. My kids adore this movie.  They would watch it everyday if I let them.  Fun for the whole family.,1379376000,,114,4.136363636363637
8445458,5,B004WOAGDG,They did a great job of converting this movie to English.  I wish they had left the original Dutch version on the DVD.  Your kids will love it.,1366675200,,143,4.071428571428571
8445459,5,B004WOAGDG,"This movie is about a little boy (6 years old) who goes out on a journey to find ""frog eggs"" to help recover his brother's voice! (A lie told to him by this same scheming brother who wanted frog eggs.. lol) when Max sees that his brother is in the hospital and unable to talk (he had had an appointment to have his tonsils removed and used that as evidence to support his claim) Max runs out with determination to find the cure. During his search he meets a friend with whom he creates an endearing bond with, and they set off on the adventure together. Mind you, since this is through the perspective of a 6 year old, the ""adventure"" isn't anything too fancy. It's quite simplistic, endearing, sweet, and sometimes silly!

So, if you're a teenager, or an adult, this might not strike you as a very good movie at all. If you have kids, I think it's very suitable for the age range it's catered to (approximately 6 years old/under?) but I enjoy peaceful films like these as they make me smile.

Notes to consider;

* keep in mind there are no ""fancy graphics"" like kids are growing up to get used to, these days. I think it's even a foreign film as the lips don't seem to match up with the words. The cover may give the impression that it's fancy and mystical (personally, I was expecting some faeries!) but it's really just beautiful nature, friendship and classical childhood imagination.

*If you have Netflix, you can watch this film from there, which is how I discovered this movie to begin with. lol

*Even though it was published in 2011, the film has a very ""old"" feel to it. I'm not sure what I mean by that, the shots are clean and clear, but it reminds me of those old films from the 1990s/80s with the way it was constructed. Nothing too fancy or modern. :)

Hope this helped!",1313539200,8,1787,4.367469879518072
