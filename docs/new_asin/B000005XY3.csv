1189079,5,B000005XY3,"The title of the tape is deceiving. ""Beginning Callanetics"" implies you are being taught the basics of Callanetics. What the tape really does is demonstrate modifications for exercises on the previously released tapes. It's really geared toward people who are totally deconditioned or have limited physical capabilities. This tape definitely wasn't for me but my 75 year-old mom, who has terrible back problems, absolutely loves it and swears by it.",1019692800,110,449,5.428571428571429
1189080,1,B000005XY3,"You will have paid for an informercial - fully half of this video is a pitch for the whole series.  the exercises are very good, but only briefly demonstrated, then you're left on your own to do them...You could do as well with a book.  Given the amount of advertising you have to put up with, they should sell this for 50 cents a copy. Deservedly out of print!",989107200,38,361,4.217391304347826
1189081,5,B000005XY3,"I learned Callanetics from the book which describes all the exercises in minute detail.  It was then easier for me to follow the tape.  I only did Callanetics twice a week, and I lost weight and was in great shape.  I got  out of it after I had a foot operation, but I'm starting again.  I highly  recommend this tape.",931564800,17,318,4.216666666666667
1189082,5,B000005XY3,"I think this is revolutionary in its own way.  It helps people with all types of injuries and it is not harmful at all to the back or the neck, whereas so many aerobics videos can be difficult and harmful.  You will see  results within a few weeks, and have both a toned body and a feeling of  your muscles being stretched beyond what you could have imagined.",915408000,34,359,4.235294117647059
1189103,5,B000005XY3,"These exercises work FAST. Callanetics was recommended by my chiropractor. It's exercise to build muscle and good for people in almost all states of physical fitness/health. Yes, the video is dated and a bit humorous, but look beyond that. Stick with it!",1508976000,,254,5.071428571428571

1189111,5,B000005XY3,"Love Callan Pinckney's exercises. I did these over 30 years ago and they are still as relevant today as they were then. I was athletic into adulthood and beyond and I come back to her exercises for the very quick results in strength and toning. These exercises work for a wide range of people who cannot see themselves doing a lot of jumping and running. They are great stretching exercises as well, which aid in strain and sprain prevention. Listen to your body, go at your own personal speed and, if you stay at it, you will GREATLY increase your flexibility, strength, and endurance. You WILL greatly benefit from these exercises. (They're worth their weight in gold regarding your physical and mental health.) They're also great for older, stiffer people. For instance, if you walk with a cane, etc. these exercises can restore your mobility making it possible not to need it anymore or as often.",1489190400,7,900,4.7756410256410255
1189112,5,B000005XY3,"A gentle yet effective workout. Deceptively challenging. Strengthens the spine and posture, - makes me feel like a dancer!  If you are out of shape or have had an injury, this is a great program to go into as it is very adaptive and Callan teaches you how not to hurt yourself while challenging yourself to build strength and form.  Believe me, in no time you will feel it and see the difference!",1485734400,4,396,4.410958904109589

1189118,5,B000005XY3,"I bought that DVD to correct the harm done to myself while not doing exercises correctly.
Callanetics helps tremendously in restoring body and helping  straighten and stretching out the muscles.
Instructions are clear and you are looking at regular and out of shape people doing callanetics ,-
not a glossy sport  models created with help of Photoshop.
Want to point out, that patience is a must  to follow this Callanetics course.
For simple reason; this DVD is extremely slow and boring.
However, if one learn all 18 sessions introduced in this DVD , it will be paid off.
Benefits of it are enormous.
So..my advise: patience, patience, patience

1189128,5,B000005XY3,"Extremely basic.  If you have never done Callanetics before this is a great starting point.  She shows how you can do the exercises without being in an exercise studio with bars and ladders.  She shows how to use tables, chairs and your couch to perform each movement.  All her other videos are done in a studio so don't give you ideas on how to perform the movements without a bar.",1456876800,11,382,4.414285714285715

1189148,5,B000005XY3,"Waaaaaay back in the 80s, I ran across this exercise program as an alternative to some of the aggressive ""feel the burn"" workouts I was doing.  It was deceptively easy-looking, and in many ways it WAS easy.  But to my great surprise, it really worked.  After an extended illness earlier this year, I found myself badly deconditioned.  Doing a regular exercise routine was more than I could manage.  I remembered Callanetics and its success and decided to give it another go.  I worked then and it works now.  One thing, when I do the routine, I have rearranged the sequence of the exercises to better suit myself; but in any order, they work.",1439510400,12,642,4.628318584070796
1189149,5,B000005XY3,"It was exactly as I remembered it in its VHS form.  In fact, I was pleased that it gave me the same great feeling in just one workout.  I found myself walking a little bit taller.  Thank you for putting it in a DVD form.",1439164800,4,220,3.8444444444444446
1189150,5,B000005XY3,"This is an absolutely wonderful video for anyone who is not already totally fit.  It is by far the most effective exercise program I have ever tried and has become a real pleasure, and I hate exercise!  After just 2 days of doing the exercises I could see changes in my body.  Callan uses people of different fitness levels in the video and shows how to modify exercises for your needs.  You will never feel as if you can't do these small movements since you can start with very simple moves and work up to more difficult ones at your own pace; all moves are demonstrated by people with varying degrees of fitness.  And, as she says, you will be amazed at how quickly you gain strength and flexibility.  She emphasizes ways to move so you don't hurt your back, and these methods work!  Once you've mastered the techniques you can increase your reps by exercising during the demos.  It is timed so that you will be doing the max reps this way.  After I mastered this video, I purchased the A.M.P.M video which is now my daily routine.  I strongly recommend these videos to anyone who is out of shape and wants to make real changes, quickly, in their body.  And,  if you also have back problems, this is the exercise video for you.",1439164800,4,1229,4.413333333333333

The movements in the hour long tape are advanced and hard to do at first. For me, it's too late. I've already adjusted to the hour long tape which I believe is the first video put out. However, I'm going to pass this along to a friend who has never been exposed to MP's incredible work out regime. It's absolutely, thebest exercise program I have ever done!! The exercises transforms your figure!!! And doesn't take but ten hours. For me, I have already done 3 hours and the difference and definition are unbelievable!

1189189,1,B000005XY3,"This material is terribly dated.  She spends nearly an hour showing about 5 or 6 exercises.  Unfortunately, I also ordered three more of Callanetics DVD's (Quick Callanetics and the Callanetics Classics 2 DVD Set). They were supposed to be more ""advanced"" workouts.  Basically, they are all the same 5 or 6 exercise positions with slight modifications.  This is boring beyond belief.  I had recalled the Callanetics name from years ago and thought I would find some good exercises to share with some of my patients...WRONG.  I would not recommend this to anyone.",1424563200,6,562,5.054347826086956

1189204,5,B000005XY3,This video had been around for quite a while I actually came looking for it because I drop 2 dress sizes in 3 weeks utilizing the information she provides. I would say and Trust I am NOT any professional but this book is geared towards gentle stretching that does not cause any jerking or strenuous movements on your part. I believe the fact that you do so many repetitions which is what gets the job done but each exercise is cater to whatever your best is as you attempt to touch your chin to your stomach however far you can curl that's where you begin working gradually you improve. the results are amazing and you'll be surprised to find how your endurance increases. Now mind you I hate exercises just as much as the next person but I found this very easy to accomplish and was surprised as I found myself getting into the range of repetition that she was actually asking for utilize this information you'll be pleasantly pleased with the results,1416009600,7,952,4.508670520231214

However, it is a good introduction before buying her more difficult workouts, and you can start the various exercises and just continue doing them the whole time she is showing modifications with her students.  There is one other callanetics instructor besides Pinckney.

If I can do this with hip, knee & ankle implants and I'm 59 years old, then anyone can!  Callan shows you in detail the proper form of each movement, so you get the maximum benefit.  It is a wonderful first step and I plan to move on to the next level when I am able to do 100 reps, as Callan recommends.  Thank you, Callan!",1378512000,9,687,4.051851851851852

Obviously the ladies I loaned them to loved them as much as I do!  The past 5 years have been very chaotic for me. In the middle of a very stressful move I broke my back. Again, I lost my DVD's.

1189250,5,B000005XY3,"After reading a negative review on this tape, I attempted to cancel my purchase, but it was too late! Boy am I glad I missed that bus! This program demonstrated to me that Callanetics was possible for me, the most inflexible 50+ year old woman walking around on two legs (with bad knees to boot!) I recently lost a lot of weight and now I want a toned body, and like a typical human, I want it NOW. I have read such glowing reviews about Callanetics, how fast it works, how effective it is, and so I thought it was the ticket. Bought the book and was downright intimidated by the apparent difficulty of these exercises. Tried a few positions based on the photos in the book, and quickly despaired of ever being able to do this. For one thing, I have not been able to touch my toes since I was in Head Start! For another somehow I have not yet gotten around to installing a ballet barre in my house! I did try to use a dining chair, but it was too light to support my weight. I even lugged my ironing board in there, staring down the menfolk in my family (""Why am I taking the ironing board into the spare room? Cuz I'm gonna exercise! Don't be so stupid!"")It was useless. Depressed and downhearted, (I really need the toning I heard boasted of by Callanetics devotees! My ""before"" pictures are truly appalling. I need some fine ""after"" pics to make all my hard work worth it!) I returned the ironing board and spent the rest of the evening resisting the urge to drown my sorrows in a plate of buttered biscuits and syrup.

Next day the despised tape arrived! I figured I might as well watch it if only to add fuel to my pity party. I shoved it resentfully into the machine, and there was Callan sneering about people's excuses not to exercise (okay, she wasn't sneering, but remember this was a pity party)to all her flexible friends! Then they started exercising. The woman demonstrating the exercises under Callan's very close supervision was a seasoned Callanetics instructor herself; slim, pretty, cool, aloof, supple as a silk ribbon! The flexible friends? A group of ordinary Joe's that I could have easily fitted into with no questions asked! A rather stocky man of uncertain age, some women who were like me, not exactly the most perfect physical specimens you will ever meet, including Callan's 80 year old Mum! Some could do the exercises with little or no correction, some had to be constantly (and charmingly) corrected by Callan. Some required modification due to various physical problems which kept them from performing by the book. And like me in my plebian little spare room, they were using ordinary furniture to assist them! Sofas, tables, chairs? I've got those! Soon I was on the floor with them, absolutely exhultant! Put my leg up on low coffee table cuz I don't happen to have a ballet barre in my den? No problem! Use my sofa to support me during the glutes exercises? Why not since it has been supporting my glutes for years anyway!

To be fair, this was not really a tape to exercise to though it does provide a short workout; it was more to show you how to do the exercises, so you will not, like me, despair when you try to use the book, or when your more extensive Callanetics tape arrives. So happy I got this! I have practiced to this tape and I can do every one of these exercises (except the ""Open and Close"" which I just laugh at, I think it was nice of Cally to throw in a little comic relief). I highly recommend it for all those like me who are flexibility challenged, yet still have the nerve to want to look hot in a pair of jeans!",1341273600,175,3571,4.425531914893617

1189273,5,B000005XY3,"Callanetics is one of the best and most accessible exercise programs I've ever known.  It was recommended to me by my chiropractor in 1988 as I was struggling to recover from a very serious auto wreck with fractures and soft tissue injuries.  At 10 months post-injury I found it possible to start at the beginning level and stay with it.  I did half the program to begin with and worked up to the full sets of exercises.  Callanetics was an integral part of my recovery from start to finish and into maintenance to this day.  It helped strengthen my body without strain on my back, which had suffered a fracture and other damage.  I started doing the exercises in my living room on a mat and did what I could manage and took it slow.  Between beginning callanetics, my chiropractor, my physical therapist, a massage/feldenkraus therapist and later tai chi and yoga, I managed to recover nearly fully from some very severe injuries and regain my strength, balance and confidence again.  Callanetics were the first step to getting in shape enough to proceed with other exercises.  Even my physical therapist was impressed with the exercises and the results he saw in me as I started doing them.

My husband and I often do these exercises together.  He is in wonderful shape working out and such and at first kind of snickered about some obscure name and what he thought were girly exercises. But he did agree to try them.  The next day he remarked several times about how it really ""did something"" because he could feel a bit of soreness in places he hadn't felt before!  That convinced him and he has done these exercises with me since.  I'm getting the advanced program for his birthday.

Callan refers to getting a perfectly lifted ""peach"" shaped butt with some of the callanetics exercises and this is absolutely true.  The exercises are simple and subtle and the movements small and precise.  They are quiet and focused on correct posture, body position, and even breath.  Most are movements just a couple of inches at the most (such as moving a leg back and forth ever so slightly) but the results are huge.  Callan gives good direction to make sure one is in the absolute correct position and how to check to be sure so the exercises work as intended and also to reduce any risk of injury.  The beginning one especially is helpful in this way.  These exercises do not bulk up muscles but do strengthen and tone a body in very good ways.

I cannot say enough about these, especially the beginning exercises.  I have given the beginning dvd as a gift to several people who have all been very pleased and continue the exercises regularly.  It's so nice to see them on DVD and easily available.",1294012800,8,2695,4.625263157894737

During my first viewing of the video, my skepticism continued, thinking these little stretches that lasted for what seemed like no time at all must be one big joke.  A scam for sure.

When I got up the next morning and began moving around,  I started to change my mind.  I could feel a gentle soreness throughout my entire body.  No one specific area stood out, nor was I in pain, but I could feel very deeply all of my muscles.  I continued to view and follow the tape for two weeks.  My partner had noticed a change in my body too, and had seen me following along with the DVD, stretching and holding, hardly working up a sweat at all.

After a month I could continue to see changes in my hips, thighs, belly and arms.  My whole body feels more loose and flexible than I have felt in years.  After 3 months I am looking forward to getting in my bikini.  If that is not enough, those tension headaches I used to get are completely gone.

You do not jump or run, you just stretch and tone the muscles, 'very deeply' as Callan Pickney says. The lady knows what she is talking about! It is the original and the best that is all I can say. Keep your boobs, lose the love handles, get legs to die for. It is every womans dream especially over 30!
