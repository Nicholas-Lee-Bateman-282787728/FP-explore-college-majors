1093804,1,6305951667,"I was very excited after purchasing this, seeing the line ""best sword fighting anime since Ninja Scroll"", but it wasn't even in the same league as Ninja Scroll. All the movie had was a bunch of old-style still frame animation with a story that went absolutely nowhere. Also the ending made no sense at all, I was expecting it to go on for about 20 more minutes. The only hightlight I can point out of this movie is that it was very violent. I'm a huge fan of samuri/ninja anime, yet I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I only wish I could get my money back. You would be better off spending your money on something else.",990921600,3,630,4.3474576271186445
1093805,4,6305951667,"This video was a big hit in Japan, and had  good reputations by critics. If you ever enjoyed the samurai animes like "" Ninja Scroll"" or "" Wrath Of The Ninja"", this will be the next step for you. But If you only love "" Rurouni Kenshin"",  well I think you better looking for "" Gasaraki"" or "" Evangelion"" . 'Cause this is the story of Samurai for his revenge & honor,  not for his rebel without cause. In other words,"" Sword For Truth"" is like ""Saving Private Ryon"", not like "" Full Metal Jacket"". So the choice is up to you.",975456000,4,522,4.098039215686274
1093806,1,6305951667,"I'm afraid this review is mostly about how Sword for Truth compares to the classic anime Ninja Scroll, but that makes sense because this little movie  is obviously a very cheap rip-off, and because Manga Video is clearly  trying to sell it to fans of that older, infinitely better work of  animation.  The packaging actually says, ""The best sword fightig  action since Ninja Scroll.""  But Sword for Truth only succeeds in  making us appreciate Ninja Scroll for how good it really was, like how all  those lame Jaws rip-off aquatic horror movies made us appreciate Steven  Spielberg's classic even more.  Ninja Scroll's violence, though extreme,  always served some purpose in storytelling or characterization; in Sword  for Truth, hundreds of stock ninja images (images, not characters) are  decapitated, vivisected, disemboweled, and butchered in dozens of other  ways, spraying their vital fluids all over everything, and none of it means  anything.  The sexual content in Ninja Scroll was fairly unnecessary, but  again it made sense within the logic of the storyline; in Sword for Truth,  women are empty images (again, images, not characters) who only exist to  have their shirts cut open and have sex with the samurai badass hero.  It's  the kind of movie that a bunch of twelve-year-old boys would get together  and make, dripping their raging hormones all over every page of the  screenplay.  The production values are terrible as well, with static  animation and low-budget voice acting.  I can't recommend Sword for Truth  in any way.  Not when there's another movie out there that does most of the  same stuff this one does, except with infinitely more taste and artistic  skill.",964483200,19,1690,5.084249084249084
1093807,2,6305951667,"Just a word of warning of this movie. I bought it on video a while back  and much to my dismay realised that it is for lack of a better term  ""still frame"" anime. Meaning lots of camera movement, and  exposition on a still frame as opposed to current anime (a la Ninja  Scroll... a movie any anime fan should see) which is constantly moving.  Plot-wise pretty good, but visually fairly slow.",964396800,,391,4.375
1093808,5,6305951667,"I thought that this was an excellent movie.  It had it all:action, drama, violence, weapons, and (erm) nudity.  All with a vague supernatural appeal.  I watched this movie three times the day I got it, and watch it whenever  I'm in the mood for a good Anime with a deep plot.  I've recommended this  to all my family and friends who like anime.  For those of you who have  never watched an anime, give this one a shot.  It faithfully represents all  of the ingredients that are needed for a movie.",960595200,5,497,4.362637362637362

1093995,4,6305951667,"SWORD FOR TRUTH

 This anime has been trashed for being a rip of Ninja Scroll.  It shouldn't be.  Ninja Scroll had two hours to work out its plot.  SFT had one hour.  It was conceived as a pilot  for a series.  Anybody who has ever seen a  one hour pilot for a tv show, especially one that didn't sell, knows how frustrating it is to be left hanging.  SFT is only half the story of the Hojp clan trying to get back two swords, which were taken from them after they lost a battle.
The longer Legend of the Devil (90min) covers the story better.  I want to read the original book or books by Takeshi Namuri.",1222473600,,605,4.085470085470085
1093996,4,6305951667,"I'm sick of people comparing this with Ninja Scroll. One, this was an episode of an OVA series that was never finished,that's why there was no ending. Two, there is some use of still images which is the style of the director Osamu Dezaki, some people like it some don't. I find it effective most of the time. Three, This is not a Ninja Scroll rip-off, it was made 2 years before it. Still the art and animation I thought were great, different but great. The only problem I had with it is the dubbing. Not very good, although I didn't like the dubbing on Ninja Scroll either, that's why I usually watch anime with the original japanese dialogue. But the version of SFT I have has no japanese audio(the UK Manga version). I think this would have made a great series had it been finished.

1093999,5,6305951667,"This is one of my favorite anime's, even though the series was never finished...  Comparing this to Ninja Scroll is like comparing apples to oranges... You should not compare one movie to another.... It's like comparing Scarface to Godfather...  How many times can you watch Ninja Scroll anyway?  This movie is for true fans of anime.  Yes, Sword for Truth does have a semi-complicated plot, but I was never bored. There is lots of bloody swordplay and nudity, so this movie is Not for kids...

Warning: If you could not follow Pulp Fiction, then you will probably not be able to follow this movie. Also, this movie was the first part of a series that was never finished...

Again, if you are a true fan of anime, get this movie.",1142208000,6,729,4.569230769230769

I wish I had read the reviews of this movie before I purchased it so I could have saved my [money] and bought a movie with a story.  Granted this has everything every hard core anime fan wants; decapitations, dismembering and gratuitious sex, but there was just no point to the movie.  Just as an interesting story starts to form, the movie's over.  You never know anything about the main character except that he did something horrible in his past.... Then there's the ridiculously pointless assassin who shows up in the middle of the film.... Nothing explained, nothing concluded.  Add the confounding pointlessness of this movie to the fact that it's not even 50 minutes long, and all you get is a big waste of money and bigger dissapointment.  Two stars for creative deaths, zero stars for story and point. Bottom line:  Don't bother....",997142400,6,926,4.74375
7898206,3,6305951667,"No it's not Ninja Scroll or even close folks, it's a random one shot OVA from 1990 that Manga Entertainment acts like is in the same league as Ninja Scroll.  Also it's from the director of The Professional: Golgo 13, Space Adventure Cobra, Golgo 13: Queen Bee, various Lupin the 3rd TV specials though he apparently was ashamed of this as he goes uncredited for it.

Moody Ronin Shuranosuke Sakaki is hired to rescue a Princess from a group of Ninjas, cue a bunch of fight scenes between him and various Ninjas that turn out bad for the Ninjas pretty much because Sakaki is pretty much invincible. Also  you can tell this from the director of Golgo 13: Queen Bee/ The Professional: Golgo 13 we have a lot of naked women and a graphic lesbian sex scene at one point.

Also midway through we are introduced to a rival Ninja character that kills someone in a one scene fight that seems out of place in the whole OVA and doesn't show up again til the tail end of the OVA. Pretty much the end of the OVA leaves a lot of threads hanging and that's the real problem of the whole thing. It's really incomplete and there's really no ending to it, it just stops and there's not a To be Continued sign at the end of it either. Apparently there was not enough sales in Japan to get a sequel OVA and yeah not in North America either.

Manga Entertainment then buys this title and makes up a bunch of awful marketing comparisons to Ninja Scroll which didn't come out til 5 years after this thing originally got released!

So yeah not a really good anime or OVA, but still the animation is at times impressive and so are the fight scenes if ever so one sided they may be. Also the excessive sex might turn off some viewers as well the incompleteness of it.",1521072000,,1741,4.325153374233129

7898214,1,6305951667,"I purchased this particular anime on eBay for only a couple of dollars without ever ""checking it out first"". BIG HONKING mistake. This is, without a doubt, the WORST anime I have ever seen & I have watched A LOT of anime. Worst of all, the plot was such a confusing mess that I actually watched it TWICE to see if I had missed something important. Yeah, I didn't. It was every bit the train wreck the second time around as it was the first.

First of all, stated on the cover art work, is a claim that this is ""The best sword fighting action since Ninja Scroll."" I would like to point out that pretty much all the ""sword fighting"" consists of is: sword being drawn, charging towards the opponent, gushing blood & body parts of opponent falling away (or vice versa- body part falling, then blood gush). Lame.
Not failing to mention that this is NOTHING like Ninja Scroll at all. In fact, I think the creators of Ninja Scroll should sue the creator of this for even mentioning Ninja Scroll. It was shameless attempt to trick fans of Ninja Scroll into buying this.

Well, anyway, onto the actual story itself.

**Spoiler alert** (If you can call it that. I don't think you can spoil something that's already rotten.)

The ""movie"" starts out with a giant white tiger attacking a group of soldiers. The soldiers are pretty bad at their job too, because despite having guns & cannons, they can't manage to hit the thing even once. So they end up being killed. The guys with the swords & spears fare no better. Out of no where appears our ""hero"" & effortlessly cuts down the tiger. He walks on, the thanks of the surviving soldiers & requests for his name ignored.
Cut to our ""hero"" walking through town & being targeted by a lady pick-pocket. Unsuccessful in her attempt to pick his pocket, she ends up with her kimono being cut off, boobs are flashed. Our ""hero"" continues to walk on. Ending up at a shrine, he is confronted by soldiers. Lame ""sword fighting"" ensues. This was just a test by the master of the earlier soldiers killed by the tiger to confirm his identity. As it turns out, the tiger was just a distraction for some sneaky ninjas to kidnap the unfortunate Princess Mayu. What they REALLY want though is some sword in exchange for the princess. (Why didn't the sneaky ninjas just take the sword in the first place?!!!) The ""hero"" is asked to take the sword & save the princess.
Cut to our ""hero"" returning to his hut & being greeted by the lady pick-pocket. As revenge for her earlier humiliation, she tries to kill our ""hero"" during some sexy time. Afterwards, sneaky ninjas attack. The sneaky ninjas are easily defeated during more lame sword fighting.
Cut to some graphic lady on lady action (one of which is supposed to be the princess) & some narrative about opium. Back to our ""hero"" on his quest to save the princess. After discovering a dead family in a house (the dead woman, of course, has exposed boobs), he arrives at the appointed location & confronts the leader of the sneaky ninjas. More lame sword fighting & the princess is saved. As our hero escapes with the princess, the bad guy (sneaky ninja leader) is attacked by a group of ninja dressed in red. Not so lame (i.e., better) sword fighting ensues, where he discovers the attacking ninja are all female (meaning that boobs were flashed, again.) Back to our ""hero"" & the princess. Attempting to return the princess, he is confronted & the sword fights go back to being lame. Cut to some random guy & another random guy. They chat at each other for a bit, then they ""fight"". The one random guy kills the other random guy in quite possibly the saddest excuse for fight scene ever. Cut back to our ""hero""  & the princess, a pointless scene at an inn & then the princess is returned home. Our ""hero"" is double crossed, but is saved by the princess & he walks away. Cut to some chanting creepy ugly naked guy surrounded by flames & wrapped in writhing naked ladies making some pointless speech. Cut back to the ""hero"" & the winner of the random guy ""fight"" passing each other on the street, they chat for a bit & then, that's it. End of ""movie"".

**End of so called spoiler.**

Yeah, that's it. All of it. Never found out why the sword the ninja wanted was so important, it doesn't reveal anything about how the ""hero"" came to be the ""hero"", but whatever.  As far as extras on the DVD, there aren't any to speak of. The special features are all just a commercial/preview of other Manga DVDs. Unless you enjoy being left with a look of confusion & a touch of disgust on your face & wondering why you just wasted an hour of your life, I would suggest passing on this one. Even if you can get it for cheap, save your hard earned money (or just go & buy Ninja Scroll if you don't already have it). This one is just not worth it. Usually I enjoy older anime titles, the cheese factor is usually good for some giggles at the very least. This one was just bad. Really, really BAD.
