Father John does indeed walk the walk; I've heard that said about others before and know many important and beautiful peace activists, but Father John lives non-violence in the very breaths he takes, the words that flow from his mouth, and the steps he takes with his feet.

He's done some truly incredible things in his life with the courage that comes from a complete faith that God is present.  He's gone to jail (over 80 times at this point) for living the nonviolence that Christ taught us, as so many of us turn a blind eye to the violence of our world, esp the violence our country perpetrates on others.  This movie isn't just for Christians, but for Muslims and Jews, Atheists, Buddhists and Hindus.  Father John follows the walk of Christ but knows that that same walk is exemplified in many others who followed the walk of nonviolence (and still follow like his friend Thich Nhat Hanh.

I wish that everyone could watch this film; it's truly life-changing, life-evolving, life-enhancing.  Despite the horrors he's seen in El Salvador and Iraq and so many other places, primarily caused by our military or our sanctions, Father John is funny and humble (truly humble)and very serious about his quest to walk the ""Narrow Path"" of nonviolence that Christ has laid out for us.",1335571200,,1515,4.694339622641509
