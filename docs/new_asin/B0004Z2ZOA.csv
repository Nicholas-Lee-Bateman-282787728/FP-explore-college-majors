2156525,2,B0004Z2ZOA,"Okay, belly dance police, let's calm down for just a second. This video WAS worth a scan of my library card, but I don't need to buy it. More on that later. As promised, the title makes clear that it is an introduction to belly dance for folks who might not otherwise try it. There were some things I appreciated like the simple movements made into a dance and her bringing her friends along to be in the video. It was nice to know they were of different sizes and how long they had been dancing. She also made constant reminders about posture---good. It is worth working up to for some one who is starting from scratch. I hope it will inspire the novice toward more, as the title is honest and accurate. What I didn't like was the part of the choreography where she flaps her arms fast while undulating in a circle---you can't see the undulation. The movement is much prettier with the arms at half-time. Try it! It's far less hectic. There was one part where Natasha tells you to watch her friend do a movement, but the camera immediately cuts to the slimmer young lady for most of the time---annoying! The costume she wore for the performance was unflattering and the beading kept slapping her microphone.

The one she wore for the cover shot was nicer. I would have appreciated a clip of her dancing at her own level. I won't nit pick further, but Natural Journeys already covered beginning and basic dance with Veena and Neena. Why do it again? I did this video during a sick day, as I find my body tolerates the easy movements well and it keeps me exercising. I will return it to the library, and have no regrets for having seen it. In any case, The video is true to it's purpose and level of dancer. We cannot expect Romper Room or Sesame Street to teach algebra, can we? If the video were called ""Bellydance for Intermediates"" (or beyond), I could understand the level of criticism this one has been getting. Let's not discourage the ""wimps"" out there.",1135123200,11,1960,4.459610027855153
2156526,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I agree with the other negative reviews and was thankful as well that I checked this out of the library.  I was not impressed by her technique or style.  She seemed very amateur and I didn't care for her teaching style. I had the same thought - why is she making a video when there are much better dancers out there?  There are much better videos out there.  For beginners, a good one to try, if you can get past the 80's hair and makeup, is Magical Motion by Atea and friends.  It's a great intro to bellydance with excellent instruction.  Shira's website has great video reviews as well - a good place to research before you buy.",1124409600,6,631,4.305084745762712
2156527,4,B0004Z2ZOA,"Out of all the reviews for this DVD I've read, most are rather unflattering. Mine isn't. I'm rather fond of this DVD. I received this for a b-day present, and as I have fibro-myalgia and arthritis to boot, these movements are helping me regain some of my lost mobility. I first started out doing the movements in my chair and then gradually tried them on my feet. These excersizes are geared towards WIMPS...this would be me. I'm not fond of pain,having lived with it for many years, but this is much lower and slower impact than many bellydance tapes I've tried. It's a good start for those of us who want to learn slowly and not hurt our backs or shoulders. I think her slow steady attitude is fine, rather upbeat and easy to follow. If you're looking for a hurry-up method, this isn't it. if you are a Wimp like I am, give this a try.",1123459200,23,837,4.337579617834395
2156528,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I went to the library to check this out (just like another reviewer did) and was glad I didn't pay anything for this! It just didn't do anything for me.

I checked out the bonus performance and have seen better dancing at amateur shows, to be frank. She was OK but nothing exceptional by far. Maybe if you saw her dancing at a local show, but to have her own video really got me wondering - why?

She breaks down the moves in little segments, and I got bored halfway through. Plus I didn't like the 'sassy' angle she plays up. Bellydance is sensual, fun, and even can be humorous, but somehow she just didn't portray any of those qualities.

I've got stuff by Jillina, the Bellytwins, Bellyqueen, Suhaila, Mara, Goldea, Dolphina, Bellydance Superstars, Atea and a couple others. And they are all better than this. Some vids make you feel challenged, sensual, are fun, and can even wipe out a bad mood or raise my energy if I'm feeling down or tired out, but this did nothing for me. If you have it and like it, more power to you, but this did absolutely nothing for me.",1121817600,21,1069,4.388888888888889
2156529,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"Thank goodness I borrowed this from the library! This DVD may be targeted for the agility-impaired, but it left me wishing I were visually-impaired. I'm generally very tolerant of the many traditions and interpretations of dance, but I just couldn't leave this out there for the unsuspecting consumer. The title makes it sound like there's some secret, easy way to bellydance, and they're going to let you in on it. Well, there isn't, and they don't. All of these moves are taught (correctly) on other beginners/fitness tapes; and bellydance, like anything else, takes time and practice, no matter what the title implies. If you can do the moves on this tape, you should have no problem with one of the higher-quality efforts. Also, the instructor's routines are uninspiring and remind me of the negative stereotypes already associated with bellydance by the misunderstood and misinformed. Her ""Bonus Performance"" left me asking, ""What does this woman have against Bellydance?"" (On a personal note...I hope her costumes are from some tradition, because she definitely has no other excuse to be wearing them. They're unflatterring, both for her and her movements.) I'm not being catty, just honest, to prevent anyone from wasting their money (or a trip to the library.) I'd refer the potential buyer to ANY other title. (Although the Twins and Rachel Brice are my personal favorites.)",1114992000,12,1383,5.151111111111111
2156530,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I'm glad that the NaturalJourney's brand DVD's have previews of other dvds on them.  I was able to preview this one, and I certainly won't be buying it.  For one thing, the moves appear to be completly made-up.  Secondly, the woman's voice is so annoying (and is she chewing food while talking, or is that just her accent?).  I'm glad I didnt' waste my money on this.  If you are a beginner, try the Goddess Workout with Dolphina, Jillina's workout, the dance instruction workouts of Veena and Neena or Bellyqueen, but steer clear of this!",1113091200,8,539,4.631578947368421
2156531,4,B0004Z2ZOA,"I too received this as an xmas present from a friend who knows I enjoy bellydancing, but can't( simply don't) get to a studio for actual class.  I found Natasha's movements and instruction easy to follow along to, and the workout gives you enough repetition so you feel like you're getting fit.  I'm no expert, but I liked it, and plan to use it!!!",1109548800,4,348,4.421875
2156532,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I would consider this video damaging to anyone who is truly interested in learning belly dance. Not only are movements done incorrectly, but they are wrong. The ""camel,"" or undulation is done with an accompanying arm movement that resembles something out of a football stadium not Egypt - it's the wave, not belly dance. I'm not sure where this dancer learned this technique.

Her ""hip drops"" are actually ""hip ups,"" and she routinely counts incorrectly for the movements she is demonstrating (things that take four counts are counted out in three counts).

Aside from bad belly dancing, this dancer is dressed in a distracting manner - almost as distracting as her affected tone and the wrinkling of her nose each time she wants to emphasize something. It's not sassy, it's silly, and it may encourage others to learn belly dance improperly, or even worse perform in a manner that looks foolish.",1106524800,18,896,4.927152317880795
2156533,3,B0004Z2ZOA,"Belly Dance for Wimps is perfect if you want to add a fun little dance routine to your usual belly dance workout, especially if you use any of the DVD/VHS belly dance exercise routines. I received this DVD for Christmas and found I was too advanced for it. Surprisingly there was no warm-up before the belly dance lesson section. I highly recommend you do some stretching before performing any of the lessons.

Natasha Senkovich is spicy and sassy as an instructor. She gives very detailed explanations of belly dance moves. And in the end she puts them together in a great little spicy dance perfect for someone who has never danced before.

If you are curious about belly dancing and want to explore the sensual side of being a Goddess, I recommend this for you. It's a good beginners DVD and easy to follow. But if you've been dancing a while and know all the basic belly dance moves, then I suggest you skip this one. It's for ""wimps"" but not serious dancers.",1104364800,7,963,4.5606936416184976
2156534,4,B0004Z2ZOA,"I just bought this video and watched it for the first time and I was actually happy with it! I'm taking a beginner's belly dance class right now, but I feel like the dance I'm learning there is so much more advanced the

So I was happy to watch this DVD and actually feel like, ""Yes! Maybe I can learn this a little bit!"" Now I'm a little scared by these other reviews saying the beat is off and that this could actually be a detriment to new dancers, but I'm still happy to learn the basic moves. So if you are truly a beginner and just need more confidence that you can actually do belly dance, and move your arms and legs in the way they need to go, I'd give this DVD a try. I think it's worth it just for the confidence boost!",1213488000,4,978,5.037037037037037
2156535,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I just finished this DVD and had to immediately come to the computer and post. The instruction and pacing is terrible. It teaches at a snail's pace, which isn't bad in and of itself, except that the instructor also talks so much between every single fraction of a movement that you never catch the flow--and her personality and speaking style is grating and self-conscious. Definitely skip this one...",1201737600,,401,4.911764705882353
2156536,5,B0004Z2ZOA,"I love this DVD. It is easy to follow the moves, even for someone as uncoordinated as myself. I like the fact that not all the demonstrators are super-thin people. You can do the whole thing, or break it up into segments. Low-impact, but it still gives a decent work out for the beginner. I've already lost five pounds!",1178928000,2,319,4.423728813559322
2156537,5,B0004Z2ZOA,"Congratulations to all of you who are fit and/or familiar with bellydance and are too advanced for this workout.  You are not the intended audience.

Having been out of the exercise habit fore a long time, I needed something basic and - knowing myself intimately - something I could and would stick with.  This is just the thing! It's fun.  It's effective.  And I can do it early in the morning without getting dressed or putting on shoes. :)

Whether or not the instructor is a great dancer is immaterial.  She is a good instructor. She takes it slow and easy, stepping up gently as you learn each move. From the very first day, my muscles were working in a way that ""feels right"" (I know the feeling from the years when I was actually fit) and I could feel the stiffness beginning to work out of my joints.

By doing this workout in the morning and Kripalu Yoga at night, I am beginning to feel human again.  Undoubtedly, as I work my way out of wimpdom, I will outgrow this DVD.  When I do, I'll look into one of the others suggested.

Bottom line: If your purpose is to learn Belly Dancing for the purpose of Belly Dancing, you will probably want something else.  If you are out of shape and want a fun and effective routine to get you moving again, Bellydance for Wimps is a wonderful starting point.",1177372800,16,1305,4.369294605809128
2156538,5,B0004Z2ZOA,"Natasha may not be the best of belly dancers herself but she does teach bellydance in a way that is really good for beginners. She's patient and you learn the moves slowly but correctly. There's actually instruction involved here. I found other bellydancing series near impossible because I felt like I was expected to be able to replicate dance moves with the greatest of ease and not being a dancer, I was like, you want me to do what?!

So you don't learn a million moves, but you do learn the most common moves thoroughly and you'll learn enough for a basic dance. I also appreciated the fact that she had a real woman doing bellydancing in the background. We're not all a size 6 you know! Most authentic bellydancers don't have a six pack from what I've seen so her workout was also non-intimidating. This is what you need before you move onto other bellydancing dvds, it's a great help for the rhythmically challenged!",1160870400,12,924,4.6
2156539,2,B0004Z2ZOA,"I bought this because it was recommended to me by someone in my beginning bellydance class.  I went through it a few times and found it helpful, but I prefer other practice DVDs a lot more.  I have loaned my copy to other beginners, who have liked it for a while, same as me, then were ready to move on to something else.",1154822400,3,321,4.079365079365079
2156540,1,B0004Z2ZOA,The dancing in this video is terrible.  Please do not spend any money learning bad habits that will be hard to correct later.  I spend more time watching bellydancing than doing it and this was painful to watch.  Please save your money.,1149292800,4,236,4.571428571428571
2156541,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"Luckily, I, too, checked this out from the library. I didn't notice the pizza slice until after I'd watched it, but wow. What is that about? Are they trying to say you can eat whatever you like but still get fit and slim by doing bellydance?

I checked it out because I'm pretty clumsy, definitely not a dancer: poor kinaesthetic sense. So I'm looking for something fun that will help me improve my body sense. I need something that will help me isolate (shoulder shimmies, for instance). I've enjoyed the Veena and Neena tapes but wanted something a bit less challenging than those.

So, I'm no expert. But right away I found this woman's attitude grating. I also wondered what ""tradition"" she was teaching from, as the dance seemed like a poor caricature of bellydance. I would have liked to have seen more of her ""students"" or friends, but the camera never lingered on them long enough. I was especially irritated when she said to watch the bigger, less experienced girl, and then the camera focused on the slim dancer instead.

It's true that the instructor does break her moves down into very small bites, and she allows time for lots of repetitions before going ""to speed."" But the quality of the dance, her personality and apparent lack of talent, plus some technical glitches made me wonder why this one made it out of production.

I'll stick to yoga and my Veena and Neena DVDs, and I'll look into some of the others that get better reviews. If you think you still want to give this one a try after seeing all the negative comments here, my best advice would be to try the library first.

I'm taking this copy back tomorrow.",1144368000,11,1633,4.578767123287672
2156542,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"This is a ""How to Bellydance"" rather than a ""Fitness"" dvd, although I would have to rate it poorly on both counts. The instructor is a terrible dancer, in fact she doesn't seem to know how to bellydance at all. Her instruction to the viewer (or victim) was inaccuate. If you are going to buy a dvd about learning bellydance you might as well get someone who knows how.  The instruction on this is  jerky, unprofessional, un-fun and annoying. For an absolute beginner there are so many better, MORE FUN, and worth while dvds that I couldn't list them all, Neena and Veena are always a safe bet for the absolute beginner. If I could have given this negative stars I would have.",1142812800,9,675,4.479674796747967
2156543,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"This is the Worst Bellydance Video I have ever seen.  Natasha's posture is terrible. She can't isolate.  Any dancer worth her salt on that slice of pizza on the cover would never do a choreo, even a beginner one, standing in one place the entire time!  She has a beautiful space to dance in but even in her bonus dance, she makes no attempt to fill that space.  Maybe that is a blessing considering that weird arm thing that happens when she body rolls in a circle. She may talk about posture but doesn't actually model good dance posture.  She communicates none of the information on stetching, warm up, or cool down that is necessary for a movement teacher of any kind, much less dance movement. Students model what they see and if you follow this DVD you risk injury at worst and learning terrible bellydance and something that is not bellydance at best.  Natural Journeys should be ashamed for irresposibly publishing something this bad.",1141603200,11,941,4.672727272727273

8036186,5,B0004Z2ZOA,"I really enjoy trying to learn belly dance. I've attended a few classes but I prefer to practice in private so I started looking for a good at home Beginnner tape. Yeah, well it seems MY version of ""Beginnner "" doesn't quite match up with most of the people making DVDs .
This is yet another great ""wimp"" version. I have the yoga, Pilates, and now this one. All of them put you at ease and actually break down the basic movements for you to clearly see and practice.

Have fun, I'm gonna look at the hula hoop one next.",1381190400,,519,4.19
8036187,4,B0004Z2ZOA,"So, I've been curious about bellydance for a while. I went to the library and checked out a couple of bellydance instructional videos for 'beginners' and one that was 'easy'. They were neither. Sure, it would be easy or for beginners if you were already in the epitome of physical shape, and had good rhythm, and knew the jargon, and what it was supposed to look like, but honestly, they were way too frickin' hard.
I still wanted to learn, though, so I looked it up on the catalog and found this one. It's actually for the level it says it is. Only ten moves are introduced, the most basic of the basic, and they are explained very slowly, in easy to understand terms.
So no, this will not turn you into a bellydance god, but after a few times, you might be good enough to actually follow along to one of the ones for 'beginners'.",1346889600,,831,4.333333333333333
8036188,2,B0004Z2ZOA,"I really wanted to like this, but there's an elephant in the room and I just can't be silent any longer...professional belly dancer? The instructor may understand the mechanics of basic belly dance moves, and may be able to execute them technically, (and maybe even kind of explain them), but devoid of the spirit of belly dance: she is the most ungraceful belly dancer I have EVER seen. And Belly dance *is* grace. I nearly ejected it from the player when she was demonstrating a step with arm movement and her arms were just FLAPPING like a CHICKEN, literally. It was painful for me to watch. I gave it a chance, though. She seems friendly, sweet, and her heart is in the right place? But it didn't get better for me. In the end I  just don't want to learn anything from an instructor I'd be embarrassed to dance like.",1344729600,,820,4.466666666666667
8036189,1,B0004Z2ZOA,"I own several ""beginner"" -type bellydance videos, and this is one of the worst.  First of all more than a few of the movements are not appropriate for agility-impaired women.  Second, Natasha's dancing is very redundant.  She appears to have limited dance skills at best in her demonstration dance.  I do not recommend this video for anyone at any level.",1337558400,,354,4.85
8036190,5,B0004Z2ZOA,"Everyone is entitled to their own review, and this is mine; this was my first experience with learning to belly dance, before I took any actual classes. I found the DVD's title and description to be perfect for someone like me, shy and convinced that they could not dance. I bought this DVD and shared it with a friend perhaps three or four years ago. I did end up taking classes (and have now been a proud member of a belly dance troupe for two years!), and was pleased to see what I learned from this DVD was what I was also learning in classes!

I loved how the instructor took you through the moves step-by-step. This allowed me to take my time and get a better feel. If I didn't feel like I had a move down, I could always back it up to the beginning of the movement lesson and start over again. I also appreciated that she encouraged posture constantly. She was very calm, and I found her instructions easy to follow.

This was good, for me, as a beginner. I did move onto classes, and I did learn things that were not covered in the video. I learned names and terminology. Instead of dismissing this as a terrible DVD, why not encourage other viewers/participants to check out a local class and learn even more, and perhaps correct any errors? It certainly didn't hurt me at all. :-)",1326067200,,1290,4.348547717842323

I did look at the instruction and it is not as technical as others, but I only do the workout.  I play the work out 3 times to get a good workout with it.  This helps me to start sweating because of the workout.  I plan on increasing it to 4 when I feel 3 times doesn't work me out as much.  I do the workout every other day. Do it one day, skip the next, then do it the day after the skipped day.  I hope this helps someone who wants to workout by belly dancing without having to do a harder DVD.",1281657600,,610,3.832

I got it because it was ""for wimps,"" and I don't think I would have tried any other DVD as a first-timer.  It was fun, and after a couple tries I bought the Veena and Neena DVDs.  Now I am taking classes and dancing every day. This DVD was the start of something wonderful for me.

I appreciated this DVD for really breaking down the steps so I could see what was being done, practice it, then put it to use.  I also like the idea that after learning these ten steps, I could put them to use in a routine.  I don't care if the moves are not strictly accepted bellydance standards.  I need somewhere to start, and this shows it more simply than my other ""beginning"" DVD, Luscious.  Luscious is beautiful and inspiring, but currently beyond me.
