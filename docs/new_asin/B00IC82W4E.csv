8640826,5,B00IC82W4E,"As a mother myself and a labor and delivery nurse, I wish every induction and full term mother to be would watch and use the techniques in this video. It is easy for any pregnant mother and partner to follow and preform.

I have been induced once which failed and these techniques demonstrated were used successfully to induce my labor. My two subsequent labors were aided by the usage with my last labor starting just 4 hours after a treatment. I am so lucky to have Featherstones and Leigh accessible to me but for those who cannot afford the massages or are not within a reasonable distance this video is a MUST!",1410048000,2,615,4.491071428571429
8640827,5,B00IC82W4E,"Leigh is amazing and graceful with her instruction in this video which is also so beautifully and eloquently filmed! The inducement techniques are doable for the partners working with the Mom and they work! I am a birth doula and prenatal massage therapist, Leigh hits on every important factor for having a safe, gentle, effective labor and birth. My clients love this video! Its a great one to add to any library for clients, friends, family...have a beautiful and empowered birth!",1404259200,2,483,4.9753086419753085
8640828,5,B00IC82W4E,"When my doctor scheduled me for a medical induction days before my due date, I became concerned about using pitocin and how hard that could be on me and our new baby.  My husband and I used the techniques in this DVD to try to get my body to go into labor on it's own. I made it to 3 cm dilated and 50% effaced and I was beginning to have regular contractions when the time came to go to the hospital. If I'd had one more day, I believe I would have been in labor on my own. I am very thankful we used this because my body started down the road to labor and the massages were so relaxing I was in a very good mindset by the time I got to the hospital. I wish I had ordered it sooner!",1395532800,2,683,3.7762237762237763
