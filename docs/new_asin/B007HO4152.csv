8516764,5,B007HO4152,"A collection of 6 videos from David Bowyer who took some incredible footage across the west.

I think my favorite was the segment where the Eureka visited the Cumbres and Toltec. We heard about the ups and downs of the trip.

All of the video work was professionally done and is of good quality for the time it was made.

Highly recommend to any steam fan!",1377129600,,356,4.363636363636363
8516765,5,B007HO4152,"I am a collector of Railroad DVD's. In my collection are steam, diesel and electric trains. This Railroad Classics DVD is one of the best I have seen. The length is amazing for the price. The trains are well-shown with crew interviews that are very interesting. The scenery almost steals the show.  This is one of those DVD's that you will want to play over and over again.",1353369600,2,373,4.485294117647059
