8447639,5,B004XYRHKA,"Just finished Tony ""Skip"" Malinowski's DVD video about Bunker Hill. Well done, Skip and all. The story,
about two colonial families and how they respond to the famous battle, was scripted by Bill Chemerka.
Some buffs of John Wayne's THE ALAMO may notice some ""Waynamoisms"" in the dialogue and even
the battle music is reminiscent of Dimitri Tiomkin's ""The Charge Of Santa Anna."" With a lot of historical
 background to flesh out the tale, THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL serves as a good tool to get kids and
 even some adults interested in history again. There is an equally interesting 21 minute featurette on the
making of the film, along with a 30 minute historical analysis in eleven segments, and a stills gallery.",1502236800,2,714,4.796747967479675
