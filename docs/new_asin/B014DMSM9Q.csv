7389249,1,B014DMSM9Q,This movie absolutely sucked! Really you are the only 2 women on a plane crash and all you can think of is how many survivors I can screw? Ruined the whole movie for me.,1443225600,4,169,4.0
7389250,5,B014DMSM9Q,"Pretty good!!  It will keep your interest throughout the movie, especially if you like movies that test the humanity of a person when faced with no options.",1443225600,2,156,4.777777777777778
7389251,2,B014DMSM9Q,"The subject matter, the location, the actors, the photographic quality...it could have been great.  It had great promise.  It lacked direction.  It fell flat.  Would not recommend buying!  So glad I didn't.  I hope someone remakes it soon and does it the right way.  The first half was much better than the second.",1442880000,2,314,4.811320754716981

7389255,3,B014DMSM9Q,"I'd have to give this movie  for being a mediocre thriller / drama. Probably the only reason I'm giving it that much is because I LOVE Nate Parker & he is a fabulous actor. It had potential to be a great movie, but then kind of fell of towards the end. I would def wait until it came out on Netflix.",1454457600,,299,3.901639344262295

7389259,5,B014DMSM9Q,This movie was amazing and FULL of surprises and adventure and downright scary.  Amazing what people in trouble will become.,1445731200,,124,5.2
7389260,3,B014DMSM9Q,"First off, I really love survival based movies, books, games, etc. I wanted to love this flick. The problem I had was caring for the characters. Only two achieved that. It is worth the watch if you enjoy the genre.",1445040000,,214,4.375
7389261,5,B014DMSM9Q,"We thoroughly enjoyed this film, which had plenty of action and suspense. The depiction of how people would react after being stranded on a deserted island, was quite believable - with leaders, followers and the few who would be dishonest and even steal to further their own good, without a thought about everyone else.

I can't remember anyone ever mentioning that the downed airliner would have had a ""black box,"" which leads to the thought that there would be a pretty fair chance of rescue. You'll have to watch; I'm not giving away the ending!",1445040000,,548,4.768421052631579

8730399,2,B014DMSM9Q,"How many stories are there that take place on an uncharted deserted island? I suppose such a thing was possible before there were google maps, but in 2016, these stories are almost in the realm of Science Fiction. Putting that aside for a minute, just how many types of stories can you tell, that take place in such a setting, and how many of them haven't already been told? Eden is nothing more than a cliche of these films, and despite not being a comedy, the fact that it has no originality to the story whatsoever is in fact laughable. After a world cup soccer team crashes near this island, and it's clear they won't be rescued, they set up a system of rules. The first major conflict is what to do with the severly injured man, who has very little chance of making it, who is costing valueable resources, sound familar Lost fans? After that, this film literally becomes Lord of the Files with soccer players in their twenties and thirties. The two sides are drawn and eventually one side leaves for another nearby deserted island. As resources continue to diminish, it becomes clear that only one side can survive and the battle is inevitable. Even the ending, which I would never reveal, is a rip off of another classic deserted island story, but maybe you like that setting and consider this the kind of film you might want to check out, okay, but first, consider this. Most of the cast are completely newcomers, and with the exception of Nate Parker, they're combined performances are a bigger disaster than the actual plane crash that brought them to this island. The bottom line, Eden is a familiar setting, featuring a story that's been done, and a cast that mumbles one cliche line after another, the whole thing just left a poor taste in my mouth.",1474243200,,1761,4.593650793650793
8730400,3,B014DMSM9Q,This was O.K!  I like Nate with facial hair. all though this movie remind me of Lost. For those who got left behind.,1470009600,,116,4.043478260869565

8730405,4,B014DMSM9Q,"I'm a big Sung Kang fan. Though he was not one of the main characters here, I was satisfied with his role in this movie. Not as brutal as I anticipated. Other characters are also well defined and showed good emotions.",1458777600,,217,4.317073170731708
8730406,4,B014DMSM9Q,"I wanted to give Eden (2014), full five star rating; however, I could not shake the impression that the director made out of the white men either a bunch of incompetent, weak, thieving, and mischievous panic-boys or testosterone exploding macho fools. As a Caucasian male I protest :)  Lately I notice it is fashionable in American media, advertisement and films to show white women along the side of macho-and-wise black men...as if the establishment and media are promoting that sort of interracial trend.

But all biases and opinions aside, I think Eden is a pretty good film, mainly because it has an interesting plot.  The film is about a USA soccer team flying back from what I gathered was a tournament or at least an important soccer game against Brazil. Their plane crashes and the survivors end up on desolate island.  Soon they are faced with the most obvious problems, such as: what to do with the wounded? how to divide water and food rations? and who will be the ultimate leader of the pack? The film is like a mash of: Lord of the Flies (1990), Lost (2004) TV-series, and Cast Away (2000) with the classic Robinson Crusoe story,

---------SPOILER ALERT---------

It was interesting to see that the black guy, who with a doubt in my mind is the main protagonist in the story, does not get laid with any of the two white girls who end up among the survivors.  The younger one loses her virginity to a white-Latino player and the older sister hooks up with the main antagonist, even though she had hots for the black dude at the beginning of the movie when they were on the plane.  Yet in the end, the black dude (Slim or the captain of the team) ends up with the older sister (Elena was her name).  So the white guys get laid, but in the end they lose. One gets accidentally killed off, and the other gets left behind.  That sort of reminded me of the film Z for Zachariah (2015), where the black guy and a white guy compete for a white girl.",1455321600,,1955,4.48169014084507
