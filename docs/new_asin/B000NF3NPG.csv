2768484,5,B000NF3NPG,"Marvellous!  the British get a turn deal with giant, giant monsters from the deep.  Perfect film for those of us who love the original Godzilla and King Kong movies and still think that they are the best versions ever made.  The stop motion special effects is a good hilarious and compliments the whole set up and ultimate demise of the monster.  (Oh,  probably should have put spoiler alert there)",1503792000,3,398,4.7101449275362315

2768486,5,B000NF3NPG,"BEHEMOTH THE SEA MONSTER (aka: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH -1959) begins w/ Steve Karnes (Gene Evans- DONOVAN'S BRAIN, SHOCK CORRIDOR) giving a lecture on the harmful effects of radiation from atomic blasts. The scene switches to the English coast, where a fisherman meets his doom from some unknown terror! Then, the beach fills w/ dead fish! When Karnes hears about these odd goings on, he heads there straight away, suspecting something radioactive may be the cause. After running some field tests in the area, Karnes conducts more intensive experiments on the affected sea-life, confirming his theory. This leads him to attempt to track down the origin of the radiation. He soon gets his wish, witnessing a huge creature in the sea! When Karnes alerts the British authorities, they decide to hunt and destroy the beast. More deaths occur in the interim. Karnes is told by a paleontologist that they're actually dealing w/ a prehistoric monster, emitting radiation, and carrying an electric charge! The question becomes, how to kill it without blowing it up, and spreading its poison everywhere! The Behemoth goes on a rampage, culminating in its full unveiling in London, w/ some cool stop-motion effects! Fans of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS will recognize some similarities, though there are enough differences to make each film a classic in its own right...",1502064000,8,1356,5.14027149321267
2768487,4,B000NF3NPG,"Lots of fun, a bit campy. Reminded be a bit a Godzilla, but in a good way. Nice to see the effects of the atomic test where not this bad.",1500249600,2,137,3.6
2768488,3,B000NF3NPG,"The program itself plays fine and is even letterboxed. However, this is a DVD-R priced at $29.98 under this title and the same film (as I found out too late) is available under the alternate title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Giant-Behemoth/dp/B000OHZJIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Giant Behemoth</a>&nbsp;for $13.49. Even if it is licensed (or if the film is out of copyright), this is still a rip-off that takes advantage of a difference in title (a difference recognized by IMdB, and so presumably legitimate in itself) to exploit buyers.",1232582400,,595,6.2682926829268295
8177518,4,B000NF3NPG,Good ole sea monster movie. It's worth watching and much more believable than the UFO docu's. LOL,1519948800,,97,4.764705882352941
8177519,5,B000NF3NPG,"I have always liked this movie since I saw when I was a kid! I admit I have a soft spot for the old monster movies. Even the cheesy ones! The acting is very good and the special effects are about par for the time, which means they're not very good compared to today's standards,But pretty good for the when the picture was made. This movie along with The Deadly Mantis and The Creature from 20,000 Fathoms are a few of my favorites from the late fifties and early sixties.",1519257600,,472,4.2555555555555555

8177521,5,B000NF3NPG,"Not bad for an old black and white movie (and I'm a sucker for oldies!).
Keep in mind, when these movies where made; special effects were good at the time, but not under todays standards. The actors did a great job, and that's something of what I look for in a movie.",1518566400,,267,4.153846153846154

Job 40:
15 Behold now behemoth
17 He moveth his tail like a cedar
Job 41:
19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.

John walks along the shore (evidently, he never saw The Blob) Whats this stuff? and sticks his hand in it. He deserves what he gets.

Looks like professor Steve Karnes (Gen Evens) is onto something big. Maybe even a creature that is the legacy of the bomb. He tries to catch it like a dog chasing a car. And it seems that the beastie has an electric personality.

Soon they realize that dispatching our friend will be complicated. But can it be done?  The Behemoth may find that hard to swallow. No kibitzing.

The versions of this movie that have subtitles will give a few laughs such as the descriptions of the background music and when clearly speaking French the subtitle says (speaking foreign language.)",1513555200,,909,4.512195121951219
8177525,4,B000NF3NPG,"This is an Okay ""B"" rated British monster movie. Its other Title, ""The Giant Behemoth"" was used for its release in the U.S. in 1959. In many ways it is reminiscent of the first Godzilla movie (1955), as it is a foreign film starring an American actor (Gene Evans), in which there is a giant radioactive monster terrorizing the local population and attacks ships at sea and destroys (well, attempts to destroy) a major city, in this case, London. It's campy, it's Stop Action at its finest, and the sound effects are absolutely, and sometimes hilariously, inaccurate to say the least. Case in point; at 31:50 into the movie you will see a jet fighter/Interceptor (a Supermarine 525) and hear its prop engine as it comes in for a landing. Yep, you read right, A jet fighter with prop engine sound effects!  Overall a very enjoyable monster flick for the kids and for those that want to journey down nostalgia lane with a box of popcorn.",1509840000,,934,4.626506024096385
8177526,4,B000NF3NPG,"This movie is listed under its original title.  At 69 minutes, it appears to be the British release of the movie.  The American release titled The Giant Behemoth is about 8 minutes longer and is also available from Amazon but not Amazon Prime.  Several internet sources list it as 80 minutes.  The British version which I streamed via Amazon Prime lists studio as Renown Pictures; My Spotlight Independent: My Production Limited.

This movie has been criticized as a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms with inferior special effects.  The movie is very similar but with enough differences that it really isn't a remake.  While the special effects are not spectacular, they are decent, workmanlike effects for 1959.  The directing and acting are solid.  Actor Gene Evans turns in his usual good performance.  Leigh Madison, John Turner and Andre Morell are also notable.

Leonard Maltin gave the movie two of four stars.  That is one half star less than he gave The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.  At this writing Rotten Tomatoes lists it at 20% with five reviews, not really enough for a true feel for the movie.  I first saw the movie on television as a child and really liked it.  I enjoyed seeing it again.  I regard it as a solid three and a half star movie.",1508630400,3,1262,4.69406392694064
8177527,5,B000NF3NPG,"love this film ever since childhood.  only, this brit. version is not complete!!  it is edited down from it's original 77 minute length to just about 69 minutes. every scene has some footage missing! even the original roar of the monster has been changed.  granted you get the original Behemoth the sea monster"" titles but be forewarned. for you serious collectors of animation films, like myself, if you order this don't say I didn't tell you!!",1504224000,5,445,4.828947368421052
