8474485,4,B005IB0OE8,Barry Green is my go to for Panasonic camera instructions and this is no different. Excellent reference dvd. Highly recommended for anyone who works with this model camera.,1441670400,,172,5.178571428571429
8474486,4,B005IB0OE8,"Just what I needed. Well written, informative. The only nit I have is that each page has art in the margins that collides with the text making about one inch of text on each page unreadable on every line without glasses and effort. The graphic obscure the text. Not sure how that got past the editors. That said, it is still worth gold and glad I have it. I also got the DVD so I'm happy.",1424476800,,388,4.118421052631579
8474487,4,B005IB0OE8,"After owning the book by the same company, we decided to spring for the DVD as well. The information and visual tips displayed throughout were a real help and made the subject areas in the book that much clearer. The AF100 is a fantastic camera, but it has a steep learning curve to be used correctly. This DVD (and the book by the same name/company) will help you immensely!",1407024000,,375,4.449275362318841
8474488,5,B005IB0OE8,"Its just great in every respect, even so some later firmware upgrades
and more features are not covered in this version. Nevertheless,
its a great help, because the operation manuals are not that easy
to understand at some points.

8474489,5,B005IB0OE8,"This is an amazing tutorial, I call it tutorial because of it's extensive course of not only how to operate this camera but a ""mini"" film-school by itself. I would recommend this to everyone (not only AF100 owners). The ""host"" of this dvd uses every opportunity to explain and display by sample not only the functions of this camera but how it's compared to traditional ""film"" cameras and discusses the best usage for the indy-filmmaker. I would highly recommend this ""instruction"" or ""tutorial"" DVD for anyone, I spent $$$$ for extension classes at film-schools and filmmaking books/dvds and this was better or the same as any good ""lesson"" for the independent filmmaker. And if you don't need that knowledge and happen just to own (or plan to own) an AF100, this is a MUST.",1342224000,2,775,4.791044776119403
8474490,5,B005IB0OE8,"As I watched this DVD, I kept asking myself ""Why wouldn't Panasonic just include this with the camera?!""  I ordered the DVD before my camera arrived to start prepping myself on it's myriad of functions and controls.  When the AF100 did arrive, I discovered that they do include Barry Green's AF100 book.  If I had known that originally, I probably would have thought twice about getting the DVD as well, but now that I have both, I'm glad I ordered it.  The DVD is great for visual learners and is very easy to watch.  Mr. Green does an exceptional job of not only explaining the many functions and tweaks, but also what they mean.  He rarely just says ""Set the camera like this..."" without explaining why or giving you different options and helping you understand why you're doing a particular thing.

If you are getting the camera, then you already have the book.  Don't hesitate to get the DVD as well.  The book goes into greater detail but the DVD will get you up and running a lot faster.",1339977600,2,994,4.5083798882681565
8474491,5,B005IB0OE8,"If reading an instruction booklet puts you to sleep, then this is for you. It goes through all the details and functions of the camera. My only gripe is sometimes he talks too fast, requiring many reverses. Also on some items he doesn't go into exact, step by step detail about how to use some of the functions. I assume they assumed you know it already. But otherwise, you need this!",1332374400,2,384,4.422535211267606
8474492,4,B005IB0OE8,"This is a great resource for any AF100 owner. Barry Green lays out the operations and functions of the AF100 in an easy to understand way. Topics from exposure setting to lens choice are covered in detail.
