8382784,4,B002W3AKTO,"'Complete' does not appear to be as complete as the listing would indicate.  A total of 10 episodes are not contained in these 5 sets, especially Season 3 with 5 missing episodes.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful set of Mythbusters DVDs.",1492905600,,236,4.7317073170731705
8382785,5,B002W3AKTO,This was a birthday gift and I had not expected to receive it on time.  I was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived on time and in excellent condition.  The gift was a hit!,1374451200,,176,4.147058823529412
8382786,5,B002W3AKTO,"I have always been a Mythbusters fan, and when I saw the chance to get all 6 seasons at once I pounced on it! I've been watching at least a couple of episodes every night. (I've even re-watched a few of the ones I really liked)
I will be watching these over and over for the years to come! I also just recently ordered season 7 and am eagerly awaiting its arrival!",1371513600,,364,4.069444444444445
8382787,4,B002W3AKTO,"I've been looking for this set forever and I finally found here. I love the Mythbusters and this satisfy my needs. My only complaint is that the ""Pilot Episodes"" (JATO Car, Biscutt Bazooka and Poppy Seed Drug Test) and ""Specials Episodes"" (Shark Week, Mega Movie Myths, etc)  are not included in this set. If you are new the watching the Mythbusters, this is a great way to get started and/or catch up.",1365120000,,402,4.583333333333333
8382788,5,B002W3AKTO,Our teenage son's favorite gift this year! This will probably be an ongoing gift idea for him for Christmas and Birthdays.,1357603200,,122,4.857142857142857
8382789,1,B002W3AKTO,"What was this? Seasons 1-6 of mythbusters for $250? Its a ripoff, I just ordered seasons 1-7 for $175. Thats right, $75 less and it comes with season 7. So go to discovery channels website before buying here.",1321574400,11,208,4.5
8382790,5,B002W3AKTO,"Our son is captivated by this series!  Now, if your child becomes obsessed with topics, watch out!  This series is addicting!  And, your child may want to duplicate what they've seen, or, at least, try their own ideas.  Now, if you are not interested in free thinking, and you want your child in the box, then these are not for you!  But, if you want your child thinking ""out of the box"", go for it.  These scientist/engineer/fx specialists are hysterical with some of the ways they attempt to prove/disprove the current myth topic.  They pull you in with their antics and you just have to watch to see how it all plays out.  Just a heads up, there is some swearing involved from time to time.  The only plus or minus, depending upon whether you would be silly enough to duplicate their actions, is that they tell you what they are doing, but they do not give enough detail to the complex; thus, you could not repeat their machine altering antics.  This probably keeps them from being sued by some very silly person who would try to recreate a show at home. Anyway, I highly recommend this product~  They are educational entertainment...  Or, they, at least, try to answer questions you may have wondered about... Have fun!!!",1310688000,,1225,4.594470046082949
