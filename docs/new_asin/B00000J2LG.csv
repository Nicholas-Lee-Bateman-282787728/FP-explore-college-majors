1231349,3,B00000J2LG,"I'm mainly writing this because I'm a little baffled by the anger expressed in so many of the reviews found here.
When I first saw ""Green Plaid Shirt"" -- on VHS, and yes, as many have noted, the quality of the transfer is agonizingly bad; let's hope some effort is made in this regard for the DVD release -- I was most struck by the relationship between the two main characters.  Yes, they are both very attractive (a common criticism of gay films and gay characters which you almost never hear about their straight counterparts), but even better, they both can ACT!
Like most films, the main characters take the main plot.  And of course, additional characters will create sub-plots.  What is unfortunate is when the sub-plots do not add to the main plot.  In which case they actively work against it.  That happens with this film as well and it's too bad because there was a lot of potential in the relationship of the two main characters, had Richard Natale wanted to concentrate on them.
I enjoy this film very much for the main story.  There are some beautiful and also some unusally moving moments in it.  The characters are appealing and multi-dimensional, and the performances (Gregory Phelan and Kevin Spirtas) are both naturalistic and of real quality.  As for the rest of it ... I just fast-forward.  I'd definitely like to see more from Richard Natale.",970358400,18,1364,4.697478991596639
1231350,2,B00000J2LG,"Yet another film delving into the hopelessness of gay love and AIDS, what a shallow commentary on our culture.  Not every gay male eschews  commitment, is a selfish ""vainiac,"" or is basically miserable.  With its convoluted plot structure to boot, ""Green Plaid Shirt""  gets a rating of tedious!",966470400,4,294,5.0625
1231351,2,B00000J2LG,"This might have been a good film but for two not slightly annoying flaws. I noticed that the director, to ensure the pristine look of the film, had the VHS version letter-boxed so that we may enjoy the entire screen as seen  by the theatre audience. I wish he'd taken the same care with the audio  quality of the video (and maybe of the film, too). It's garbled and  murmured and one can only catch about every third line of dialogue - if  that. Even the rewinding and replay didn't help (thinking maybe I could've  understood it on second play). So, I guess the third of the movie I could  hear was credible and worth the effort.
Secondly, I get really fed up  with the premise that really hip gay men are completely or mostly gorgeous.  They may be poor, but they have bodies to die for, and big, exciting,  fabulous lives. Even when down, they're a laugh a minute! This is probably  what most gay men would want everyone to believe, but it just isn't  reality. I'm looking forward to the film that can deal with that - that can  show ordinary lives in extraordinary ways. It may turn off a lot of gay men  that need something cute to look at in order to hold their interest, but  when was society ever served by appealing to the lowest common denominator?",963446400,12,1258,4.366379310344827
1231352,4,B00000J2LG,"I bought this movie upon the recommendation of a friend. Glad I did. Have shared the story with several frinds over time. I see something different  each time I watch it.
I lost a lover 5 years ago.
It is a moving  story of friends and lovers and the good and not so good in us we don't let  anyone but our closest of friends experience. It is an accurate take on  relationships, both in and out of bed.
It's great to see a movie where  the gay character(s) aren't psycho or totally flaming (although, there are  a couple of guys who do  spontaneously combust.) The people here are more  like people I know.
The film was very well done and the characters  engaging; some more likeable than others... like in life.
The sound was  disappointing; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
I would have  purchased it on DVD if available.",963360000,21,832,4.372549019607843
1231353,4,B00000J2LG,"We enjoyed the story and the presentation of it. Romance, illusion and bold reality are bouncing off each other in this film and have a ring of familiarity, especially when they are finally connected together towards  the end. BUT despite our 1st class equipment we had considerable trouble to  hear the dialogs clearly. The audio appeared to be handled somewhat  unprofessional, mainly in the first half of the film which added a touch of  annoyance.  (Of course there is the possibility that we got  an impaired  tape but I doubt it.) Overall a film worthy to watch.",946771200,9,568,4.793814432989691
1231354,5,B00000J2LG,"This is now my favorite drama about gay men in love; and TRUE love, not fascination, is certainly central here---a rare enough feature as it is. The symbol of that love is the titular item of fabric, worn over the course  of ten stormy years, alternately, by the two protagonists, Philip and Guy.  The former is the ""faithful one. The latter the emotional bruiser in  the story.
  The thoughtful story is non-linear, composed of shuffled  scenes divided roughly into two time periods: (1) ""Before he betrayed  me"" and (2) ""After he forgave---and  more importantly---  forgot.""  The syntax of the narrative is abetted, more or less, by  the appearance or non-appearance of that green shirt, which serves as a  sort of punctuation mark along the rough-and-tumble jumble of events in  ""constant collision"":
  (A) A colon, for instance: in one  ""after"" scene the loving revelation of a slotch of yellow paint  on the shirt refers us instantly back to a ""before"" scene  explaining the loving source of that same splotch, providing undisturbed  continuity between two periods of time, a transition made possible only by  Philip's act of forgiveness.
  (B) A ""comma"": When the shirt  does not appear in a given scene, the scene is tied to the preceding  picture in the sequence in which the shirt does appear. Such as when Linda  helps Philip pack Guy's bag for his first (of many) trips to the hospital.  We know from the shirt's absence there that the scene falls chronologically  after guy's seizure in the kitchen, the topic of that scene which  immediately precedes.
  Rare intelligence in film-making, regardless of  genre.",946166400,21,1622,4.962546816479401
1231355,5,B00000J2LG,"This is one of those films that make me wish I had seen it in a theater.  Well-acted by a cast that SHOULD be stars by now (Kevin Spirtas and Greg Phelan in particular - and a nice turn by Russell Scott Lewis) and  featuring a sensitive and nicely thought script GREEN PLAID SHIRT is as  wonderful as its title - conjuring up images of that comfortable piece of  clothing favored by ones lover.  Surprisingly, this film is presented in a  widescreen format. It looks wonderful and gives the film a more cinema-like  look and feel. There is no doubt this film will look and sound even better  on DVD - hopefully Wolfe Video will read this review and decide to issue  it. I highly recommend this film.",942105600,20,699,4.3984375
1231356,4,B00000J2LG,"This is an exceptionally well-written and convincingly acted film about disillusion in romance and forgiveness in love between men.  The opening scene immediately sets the tone when we, along with the protagonist,  overhear two men earnestly discussing their relationship with a poignancy  recognizable to anyone who has loved.  From there, in a series of  flashbacks, the film takes us through the deeply faulty path of committment  between eternal opposites: one who is essentially faithful and another who  is not in the late 70's.  Many of the lines are memorable which is what  particularly gives this film its depth.  Early on we are promised a moment  which, to paraphrase, cancels all that goes before giving the strength to  endure all that is to come.  Yes, AIDS, but not before we witness that  moment, one of forgivness so beautifully wrought, so lovely as to instruct  us in love itself.  Written and directed by Richard Natale who unmistakably  knows what he's doing.  He is notably aided in this by Gregory Phelan and  Kevin Spirtas whose feelings fill and fulfill every silence, look and word  of this small masterpiece.",936230400,22,1136,5.037837837837838

The reason for not loading was 'internet down' however I was able to view other trailers, etc. I suspect that it has something to do with the age of the movie and the inability of my equipment to access older items.

I personally remember the mental struggles of the fear before we were even able to test for the disease.  But to throw a suicide into that mix was just too much for me.  I wanted to like the movie, but in the end felt frustrated and that I had wasted time watching the movie.

1231365,4,B00000J2LG,"I love this film. The description does not do it any justice whatsoever. It is very low-budget and understated. Nonetheless, there are some beautiful pictures of geography (beach scenes). Also, the relationship between the two main characters is so tender and real. I envied that.

There are some drawbacks:

A little too long and choppy plot.
The introduction of this character ""Todd"" was very contrived.
The two main characters seemed to have difficulties suddenly; we needed more development in that area.",1328745600,3,508,5.2592592592592595

1231367,3,B00000J2LG,"""Green plaid shirt"" could have been a very good movie, but it fails on some levels.
To start with - sound!!! At first I thought it was the copy I had. But after I had read other reviews I realized it's the film itself. THere were moments I could hardly understand the dialogues! Well, it didn't help to watch it at all.
The story. Not bad, but the action suddenly slows down and there is too much talking. The sub-plots don't bring anything to the film, don't enhance it. Moreover, the border between past and present events is sometimes so vague, that it's really hard to make a head or tail of the plot.

To sum up: it's not an optimistic film, but acting is fair good. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.",1310601600,2,724,4.323529411764706
1231368,4,B00000J2LG,"Starting the movie and halfway through, I kinda regret to watch this movie a bit; mostly because i tended to choose a happy ending movie; Real enough to keep me watching but happy ending to give me hope. This movie does not exactly ends with a happy ending;I watched the characters being happy, people die, sexual urge, love; it has everything but at the same time nothing too intense, just a bit of each. And though it goes against my feeling about monogamy, I feel ok about it cause I am not sure about monogamy myself.
The more I watch it, it turns out to be a really powerful movie, different character depths, stirs up in me different emotions. I especially like the ending even though I don't usually like anything that is not clearly a happy ending, it does bring me extremely meaningful and hopeful message. All that help them carry on is that moment of forgiveness, and then he's gone...
The only thing that is off for me is the video and sound quality. It is a bit hard for me to listen to everything. But at the same time, the fuzziness of the movie made it 80ish and more real than if it is crystal clear. I am just bitching 'cause I could not listen to everything that I wanted to.",1300492800,13,1194,4.334821428571429
1231369,4,B00000J2LG,"I loved the chemistry between the lead couple. Not alot of gay films I can say this about. Well, besides Brokeback Mountain, and Big Eden. This indie-film really did pull off a lot too; less is more as they say. Great acting, emotional depth, great themes. Made me think, and feel, about what the reality is with regard to dealing with death and the part that recollections/memories can play into that. It's a powerful film in that it is not sentimental, but provides a greater overall understanding to life: you feel the struggles and experiences of the characters. And, I think it's the type of film you see a second time and notice new and different things you had't caught the first time 'round. PLEASE NOTE: Kevin Spirtas (as Guy) is out-of-this-world orgasmic hot from hair to toe!!! I mean, just the character name, ""Guy"".

1231372,5,B00000J2LG,"Green Plaid Shirt is a flawlessly conceived and executed gay love story made challenging by poor sound quality. It takes a lot of attention, audio adjustments, and frequent rewinds to understand everything that's said, but it is WELL worth the trouble. People who aren't willing to invest such time and energy will understandably hate this movie, but those who are willing to will be greatly rewarded.

It's probably the most beautifully moving and believable love story I have ever seen anywhere. Besides the sound, everything about this movie--writing, direction, acting, editing, photography--is absolutely perfect and astonishing. The story line is not chronologically linear, but it's perfectly fitted to the development of this particular story and makes it easier to follow than if it WERE chronological.

This is no fairy tale romance. There are failures, betrayals, stupidity, selfishness and much sadness along the way, but that's how life is. Learning to love another person THROUGH troubles like that is the greatest good available to us as human beings, and that is exactly what this movie is about.

Two of the supporting characters (Jerry and Devon) are so self-centered and obnoxious I was relieved any time they were out of the story, but even they are entirely realistic, believable and very well-acted. Everybody else--including Phil's mother, who's on for only a couple of minutes--is simply perfect. Others have rightly commended Gregory Phelan and Kevin Spirtas in the leads; I'll add Jonathan Klein as Todd, one of the most original, appealing, and fascinating characters who ever appeared in any movie.

I have never recommended a movie as highly as I recommend Green Plaid Shirt, to anybody who is willing to invest some of him(or her)self in watching it.",1246752000,4,1780,5.235087719298246

So, that told me that the other reviewers here were expecting a high budget film which it isn't. I thought the film was very put together and made alot of sense. It was a story of the main actor's love, lose and letting go do to AIDS. I usually avoid these type of films (AIDS related) because I myself have seen too many people dying of AIDS.

1231375,4,B00000J2LG,"""Green Plaid Shirt"" is a fabulously touching (and heart-wrenching) love

story that brilliantly covers so many bases. Set in the late-80s to

mid-90s, a group of gay men is struggling to find the balance between

simply being in love and the ever-evolving world of queer politics and

realities--from polyamory to finding community to dealing with AIDS.

The opening scene sets the mood for a story of true love, and the pains

and joys that go with it. Philip is searching for meaning in the love that

he has felt for so long, and takes us on a journey through his memories of

the past ten years of commitment. What he reveals is a beautiful story of

two men falling in love, and then forcing themselves to change their ways,

to open their relationship, and to detach themselves from feelings of

dependence and of jealousy. Through the years, other partners come and go,

they deal with friends dying of AIDS, they go through good times and bad

times, both together and apart. And ultimately, they discover what it is

they both need.

""Green Plaid Shirt"" tackles a lot. It's a very astute story about

insecurities, love, the ebs and flows of monogamy in queer culture, and

the harsh realities of AIDS and other illnesses. It's a remarkable love

story that could happen in any decade, but is a poignant story about gay

love in the 80s and 90s. It's a phenomenal tale with humor, heart-warming

passion, and a powerful message. A beautiful movie.",1132185600,6,1456,4.7023809523809526

The two meet up later at an outdoor bar and thus blossoms this romance were they fall in love, have sex and move in together. As the movie jumps forward and back  and forward again, Guy has left Phillip for another man and contracts HIV and then moves back in with Phillip. In addition, several of Phillip's closest friends also have contracted HIV and begin entering full-blown AIDS and die.

I know this movie was made on a budget, but the film quality was so poor I had to try and read the actors lips to actually tell what they were saying and that was with the volume at max. The script is scant, a fast paced romance that is editted so badly you lose the power and effect of the couple's struggles in the film. The writing and acting comes across as forced and wooden, which is  more a fault of the writer and director then of the actors. This movie deals with a sensitive and serious topic AIDS, however to much emphasis is placed on the physical side of sex and random nonsense commentary, rather than on the complex and constantly changing face of love and comparsion. Lastly, the green plaid shirt just became annoying after the tenth time seeing it, not mention it is one of the ugliest shirts I have seen. Just as a simple white t-shirt is uncomplicated yet sexy, tightly written dialogue and focused direction amplify the effect and message you want to come across without the distraction of rampant drama or plaid.",1120780800,2,1599,4.487972508591065

If I could understand more than about 25% of the dialog, I would have more of an opinion about it.  The sound is so poor that a decent home movie would easily outclass the sound here.  I am not sure how a producer or distributor would think it was okay to release a movie where the sound was this poor.

However, just like a foreign film, you can usually get the jist of what is happening even if you can't understand the words.  If only there was something going on in this film.  There isn't, and to cover up for the lack of plot or storyline, the director or editor chops up the pieces and plays them out of sequence to, apparently, create the illusion of story.

Really, this film is a disaster, even when graded on a curve for gay films.  Apart from the decent leads, which do a fair job of carrying this film for awhile, there's really nothing here to see.  I'd avoid this one.",1120521600,,1023,4.259067357512953

The story centers around two people Phillip (Gregory Phelan) and Guy (Kevin Spirtas) who meet at a garage sale in 1978  when Phillip buys a Green Plaid shirt lays it down on a table for a moment to pay for it and Guy picks it up to try it on; of course Phillip informs Guy He had just paid for it and wants it back.

The story of the lover who dies from AIDS would actually seem more tender, loving and meaningful if it had simply been told in a straight-forward manner.  Indeed, the jumping about seems to diminish the tragedy of his death.  The acting is very good and the premise of building a story around a plaid shirt is both effective and appealing.  The romance of the two lead characters is tender and caring and is definitely worth experiencing by watching this slightly flawed  gem of a movie.  We need more gay love stories and this is one to put on your video shelf and watch with someone you care about very much.",997228800,14,1024,4.659217877094972
1231384,1,B00000J2LG,"This is just an awful little movie in every possible way, even the sound is terrible.  It is so muffled you often can't understand what is being said.  It reminded me of the sound quality you get when you order at a drive-up box at a fast food restaraunt.  The DVD starts with a ""thank you for watching our film"" - a sort of ""we hope you don't think it's too bad, we know there are problems"" sort of thing - from the producers.  It goes downhill fast from there.  And another thing - you sure get sick of that ""green plaid shirt"" gimmick they hammer you over the head with.  [....]  No one could possibly truly enjoy this film unless they made it or were in it.",989366400,7,661,4.1171875
1231385,4,B00000J2LG,"I liked this movie, alright at the start it was a bit hard to follow and work out when everything was set. The sound was poor for the first half, but by the end you really don't notice.
I found it to be a warm, honest, and realistic view of two people in a relationship, and the relationships they had with the people around them.
Nobody's perfect, and I believe that's shown throughout the whole movie, but honestly, the acting was brilliant, the cast were well placed, and the storyline was good.
Not your average hollywood glossy, where everything comes up roses in the end. It was good to see that you know where the relationship started and ended, but the movie finished with a memory, not a death.
it's too often we look at the glossy ""perfect relationships"", beautiful bodies, and glamour of the high budget movies, this one deserves praise for realism, both in the script writing and the acting. By the end of the movie I thought I was looking at any one of the people I knew, perhaps even a little of me and my partner.
The one thing I do know, is that although not the best gay themed movie I've seen, It's one of the one's I'll keep going back too.
The Soundtrack stopped it from being a 4&1/2 stars",978048000,5,1210,4.3584070796460175
1231386,2,B00000J2LG,"This film has good intentions and gets off to an interesting start but quickly collapes in on itself. First of all, the characters, except for the lead, are basically all unlikable and uninteresting. And I'm sure to the chagrin of many gay viewers, they all end up having sex with each other (no wonder we are talked about - not all gay people and gay relationships are this way!) The major problem that I had with this film was the confusing time line and flashbacks. In many instances, it is hard to tell at what point something is happening and you are wondering if it is after or before the previous scene. Another problem is extremely poor audio (even on dvd). Pluses are good acting and imaginative cinematography but these points alone fail to make this film recommendable.",975283200,13,780,4.659420289855072
