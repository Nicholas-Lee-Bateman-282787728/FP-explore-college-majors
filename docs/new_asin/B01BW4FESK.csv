Not exactly their finest hour, but still reasonably interesting.  Two major drawbacks though.  One, the season just ends with no real closure of any kind.  Two, the resultant movie is the weakest of all four.

I'll still be buying it before too long, but it's annoying to have seasons 1, 2, and 4.  Seeing as this one is burn on demand, it couldn't be that hard to do the same for season 3.  Feh!",1455926400,2,448,4.325301204819277
