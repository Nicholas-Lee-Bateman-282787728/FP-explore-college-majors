The story begins in a country pasture. The house suggests central Europe. A woman walks along a country lane and whistles a tune. The soldiers in uniform tells of the era and country. Bavaria, August 1939. Two men can't get a room at the hotel. The train doesn't run on schedule because of the military's need. Amanda does her act and generates criticism. A man wants to know the Test Score in England. Did Mrs. Kelly make a spectacle of herself? She talks to a journalist from LIFE magazine. Travelers board the train to leave the country. Amanda gets her compartment seat, and is joined by Miss Froy. Two policemen ask the hotel clerk about a name in the register. Gone! A couple is returning to England after their vacation. Miss Froy drinks an herbal tea from Mexico; she is a private teacher. Kind enough to pass the sugar? ""Don't mention it.""

Amanda naps after lunch. She awakes to find Miss Froy is missing. The other passengers say she was alone. So does the waiter. Condon the journalist comes to her help. Perhaps it was a misunderstanding? Froy's bag is also gone! Those two Englishmen don't remember Froy. The train stops to pick up an invalid and a nurse. Nobody leaves the train. That couple doesn't want publicity, or a divorce. Then a new Miss Froy shows up! ""I've never seen this woman before in my life!"" One witness changes her story. ""Why?"" Can reporter Condon help her? Marry for money? ""How could you?"" Amanda explains why she married so many times. ""Its only money."" Amanda pulls the emergency brake! That Doctor is very helpful. The other passengers attack Amanda in her compartment! [Its like a nightmare.] Amanda and Condon search the baggage car. A man attacks them, but is repulsed. What do they want?

Condon gets an idea. High heels on that nurse? Why would they kidnap an old harmless lady? Will the Doctor remove the bandages? His is so cooperative and friendly for a stranger. A conspiracy? ""How do you know?"" ""Who will believe you?"" The Doctor pulls a pistol. Their drinks were drugged! Condon climbs to another car and asks for help from the nurse, and gets it. He talks to Miss Froy! Next it's the Trainmaster. All seems well. The nurse talks to the Doctor. That patient is transferred to a waiting ambulance. The villains discover the substitution after the train leaves the station. Miss Froy discovers the rest of the train was uncoupled! Its tea time, the English are in the dining car. Condon explains all. The train is stopped, a Nazi official says they want to talk to Miss Froy. Will they surrender Miss Froy? The train workers have all gone away.

Those officials mean business. Shots are exchanged. Miss Froy explains the message to be delivered to White Hall, then leaves the train to travel on foot. A white flag won't stop a bullet. The train reverses direction, then the switch is thrown to continue on the main line. Amanda runs for the train. They all return to England to learn the latest news. Will there be a happy ending? For today. [The original movie did not know what would soon happen.]

This is a new version of the 1937 Alfred Hitchcock movie. That European power is identified. This story is like an Eric Ambler novel where an ordinary person finds himself in a dangerous situation, but survives. The use of a tune to convey a message is unusual. Using a substitute to replace a person goes back to ""The Prisoner of Zenda"". Travelers freely carried guns for protection. Who could have imagined that Britain and America would ban guns after the war? This story can explain the mystery of JFK's body. The experienced doctors in Dallas said the shots came from the front. The doctors in Washington said they came from the rear. The substitution of a double can explain this discrepancy.",1424736000,,3814,4.678092399403875
