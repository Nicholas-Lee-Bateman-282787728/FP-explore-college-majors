THEN CAME ""WALTON'S MOUNTAIN"" WHICH TOUCHED THE MORE DEEPER WITH SCRIPTURE AND LESSONS OF THE LORD'S FAITH AND LOVE, EVEN THROUGH TIMES OF HARDSHIP AND TRAGEDY, AND NOW AT LONG LAST THE GREATEST OF THESE TELEVISION SHOWS OF DEEP INSPIRATION, UNDYING LOVE, EMOTION, AND GREAT FAITH. THE CONTINUING TALES THAT TELLS US OF THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH OF ""ANGELS"" SENT HERE TO GUIDE US, COMFORT US, ENSURE US OF THE LORD'S GREAT LOVE FOR US, AND HIS ENDEARING CARE AS WELL FOR US ALL!!! TALES TOLD IN A TODAY'S WORLD, TORN BY WAR, HATRED, BITTER CONFLICTS, AND INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS THROUGH FLASHBACKS OF YESTERYEARS OF BYGONE TIMES WITH EVENTS AND PEOPLE OF GREAT COURAGE, THROUGH GREAT HARDSHIP AND SUFFERING. THIS SHOW HAS TOUCHED THE VERY GAMBIT OF HEAVEN AND HELL, WITHOUT GROTESQUE HORROR, OR BLOODSHED, BUT IN TURN TELLS IN ELABORATE HOUR-LONG TALES OF VARIOUS STORIES OF BEAUTY AND HUMAN CONFRONTATION SUCH AS TO RISE AND TOUCH THE VERY CHRISTIAN FAITH THAT LIES DEEP WITHIN US ALL; AND FILLS US WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THOSE MORALS ARE AND HOW WE AS EVERYDAY PEOPLE CAN LEARN OURSELVES TO CONFRONT THEM, IF THEY SHOULD ARISE IN OUR OWN LIVES. EACH EPISODE HAS LEFT ME IN TEARS, AND BROUGHT ME CLOSER TO THE LORD IN SO MANY BEAUTIFUL AND THOUGHTFUL WAYS, I'M SO BLESSED FOR HAVING SEEN THIS SHOW!!!!
I ALWAYS WILL!!!! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!!!",1078704000,10,1479,4.78125
