6401663,5,B00K2OBY86,"All of director Amando de Ossorio's four BLIND DEAD films on 4 DVDs in one very inexpensive sets, which all contain the extras that were on the single disc editions. If you like your films full of atmosphere with a sprinkling of blood and gore (The first film was released to theaters as simply THE BLIND DEAD in a severely edited PG-Rated form, so the original version is really something to see), then you could probably do no better than this set for the price. The third film in the series, THE GHOST GALLEON (released in a severely edited TV version called HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES), is probably the weakest entry of the film, but it is still better than most crap that was made in the United States. So to make it short and sweet: If you like watching eyeless skeletons riding decaying horses that can only find you if you make a noise, than these film are for you. If that doesn't interest you, than stay away. The first two films are offered in their American theatrical versions and uncut Spanish versions. The other two film are shown in their fully uncut versions so there is no worry about watching truncated versions of these films. These are atmospheric horror films from the 70's. Films that could never be made today. Recommended.",1423180800,2,1243,4.57847533632287
6401664,5,B00K2OBY86,"Tombs of the Blind Dead is a masterpiece of the Eurohorror era. While the remaining 3 do not have the same impact as the first, necessarily so, as viewers will now be familiar with the Templars and so viewers will be less mesmerized but irregardless, de Ossorio artfully creates stories that are unique, artful and memorable. I don't value the other 3 less. Just saying that any time you are exposed to something new, when you see it again, its not new anymore, so some of the novelty effect will be lost there. Like I said, de Ossorio appeared to know this and compensated for it in some way.

Keep in mind, this was set in the 70s, made in a country that had been living under Fascist rule for a long time and as such, while it is modern day (then), it can feel older to someone with strictly American ideas of the 70s.

I'm not going to emphasize the virtues of these films. This is one any self respecting horror junkie would watch. The Blind Dead are totally iconic. I have ""The Blind Dead Collection"", also by Blue Underground, which is the 4 movies in this one, along with a 5th dvd that is a documentary of de Ossorio. It also has a nice booklet and the set is housed in a coffin box.  This set here is the same 4 DVDs. Same transfers. The set offered here has no extras (the documentary, the booklet or the box). The quality of the DVDs in either (essentially the same) are as good as you are going to get. What are you waiting for? Snatch 'em up!

Long live Amando de Ossorio!

And the Blind Dead, of course!",1415232000,9,1518,4.256944444444445
6401665,3,B00K2OBY86,"A nice cheap set with all four movies that look great. I have to say, the movies themselves are not outstanding horror films. But the BLIND DEAD themselves - they truly are incredible creations. They give good heebie geebies whenever they rise from the grave. Certain aspects are impressive - The supernatural elements, the cinematography, the use of slow-mo is effective, the score. They're just weak in plotting and pace and undermined by disjointed narratives and sometimes other aspects of the movies look cheap. As an example, the third in the series, ""The Ghost Galleon,"" uses an almost laughably fake miniature for it's ghost ship, but then you can't complain about well done, spooky ON-ship sets and their's no denying the creepy effectiveness of the scene of the Blind Dead stalking the beach en masse!",1410134400,2,811,5.014814814814815
6401666,3,B00K2OBY86,"Let me be clear- I love these movies.  The lesser rating is due to the way this set has been packaged.  The four discs are on opposite sides in two disc groups.  There is no space between the top disc and the bottom disc.  There is no space between the bottom disc and the plastic package.  The first set I ordered had severe scratching on all four discs, the replacement set still had scratching, not as severe, but still there on all four discs.

On the flip side.  I contacted Blue Underground directly and after I mailed them the scratched discs, they mailed me replacements of all four discs in jewels cases (which kept the discs better protected).  So while I am not a fan of how it is packaged, Blue Underground is a solid company that stands behind their product.",1407974400,16,771,4.418439716312057
8655433,5,B00K2OBY86,"As a fan of these movies, this is a solid budget collection if you don't go for the coffin collection. It has all the movies, no true special features to be found here. Can't speak to any better copies, like the BR release of ""Night of the Seagulls,"" but the films look fine and the sound is ok.

Movie, trailers, a box.",1516320000,,320,4.161290322580645

8655435,5,B00K2OBY86,"Gotta love how Amazon uses sales tactics. ""More on the way"". But it's a ""limited edition"" so....

Anyway, I have the OTHER limited edition of this that came in a box shaped like a coffin. Was released by Blue Underground who couldn't have paid too much for the releasing rights since it retails for only around $50 for 4 movies + a bonus disc with info about director Amando DeOssorio.",1494806400,,385,4.5
