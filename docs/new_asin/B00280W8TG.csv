8355500,5,B00280W8TG,"6 dvd's and all the stories were excellent. The Nature series is not shown in Australia unless they are narrated by Sir David Attenborough so it was a pleasure to discover them. For me the programs ""In the Land of the Wolf"" and Pale Male""were the best but it was hard to choose. Excellent picture quality and the narration by F.Murray Abraham is spot on.",1468108800,,354,4.461538461538462
