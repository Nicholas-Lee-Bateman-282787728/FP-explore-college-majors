401949,5,6301978501,"Its impossible not to consider the turmoil that happened off-screen as you watch this film, knowing how much Judy Garland struggled to stay grounded during the production and failed.  The film was troubled before they even began (by her drug dependency).  She had just been fired from the film Annie Get Your Gun.  They considered abandoning Summer Stock and taking the loss.  She routinely failed to show up for work or showed up late and left early.  It took six months to finish this film.  Even though the film was a success, MGM refused to work with her again.  This movie succeeded in spite of Judy Garland, because they surrounded her with old friends willing to help her.

The plot was an old one often used: lets put on a show.  For that reason, they thought to pair Mickey Rooney with Judy (for old time sake).  But Rooney was no longer a box office draw and Gene Kelly was.  They also picked Busby Berkeley to direct but Judy didn't like Busby.  They replaced him with Charles Walters, an old friend of Judys.  The results are undeniable.  This is a great musical.  (My favorite Gene Kelly film and one of my favorites featuring Judy.)  Its fun, its funny, the music is fabulous, Kelly dances on tables and newspapers!  Whats not to love!",1470960000,,1249,4.579185520361991

402031,5,6301978501,"Avid fans of vintage films such as I, can echo the above lyrics from one of the songs from ""Summer Stock"" regarding the first time we viewed Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, together or apart in a movie.  They were two of the most coruscating, glittering stars in the movie musical firmament.  ""Summer Stock"" was their third and last film together.  It also was Judy Garland's final movie at MGM; she would be released from her contract shortly after the film opened.  There are stories galore about how troublesome she was during the filming, her mounting health problems and her failing marriage to director Vincente Minnelli playing havoc with her psyche, and making the production a slow, agonizing shoot.  It's a tribute as to how highly regarded Ms. Garland was by her fellow actors and crew that nary a harsh word was said about her.

This film was kind of a throwback to Garland's ""Hey let's put on a show!"" series of films with Mickey Rooney from the early 1940's.  The plot is fairly simple, Jane Falbury's (Judy Garland) farm is in financial trouble, and she has lost all her farmhands, leaving only her faithful housekeeper  Esme (Marjorie Main).  In order to clear her debts by successfully bringing in a good harvest, she persuades the father of her meek, bespectacled, longtime fianc Orville Wingait (Eddie Bracken) to loan her a spanking, deluxe tractor from his hardware store.  After driving it home, she is astonished to find her barnyard invaded by a loud, swarming theatrical troupe, headed by Joe D. Ross (Gene Kelly), the de facto producer/director/writer /actor.  It turns out he is the boyfriend of Jane's spoilt, dilettante, younger sister Abigail (Gloria DeHaven) who is now flitting with a theatrical career.  As the nominal leading lady, she has promised Joe & company her sister's barn to use as a summer theatre to present their show.  Jane at first is furious and orders them to leave, but after Abigail pouts and applies some guilt, Jane reluctantly agrees they can stay, provided they all pitch in with the many chores needed to run the farm.  At first resistant, Jane gradually softens toward the troupe, especially Joe to whom she finds she is strangely drawn, as is he to her.  This causes tension between Orville & she, and matters take an unexpected turn when Abigail who has become a prima donna runs away to New York with the pompous male lead (Hans Conried) who has promised her a part in a Broadway show.  Two guesses as to who will step in to replace them?

Despite Judy Garland being in terrible shape, she turns in her usual finely honed performance, full of natural warmth and skill.  Watching her, you would never guess what chaos was going on behind the scenes.  She never shortchanges her audience and gives 110%.  Musically, she is in excellent voice, and starts off right away with the buoyant, cheery ""If You Feel Like Singing, Sing!"" which she starts in her bathroom shower, and continues as she gets dressed. Not to worry, it's all very modest.  Although the powers that be had had problems with Ms. Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" from ""The Wizard of Oz"" in a barnyard, apparently it was all right for her to sing the perky ""Happy Harvest"" while driving a tractor.  She supplies a kidding final touch when holding and belting out the final notes as if finishing an aria, her mouth stretched wide in a big close up.  Her second best number in the movie is the wistful, yearning ballad ""Friendly Star""  which is rendered with a quiet poignancy and has some of the best close ups of Garland's huge, dewy brown eyes.  What is noticeable is her appearance, her weight fluctuates up and down, her hair for the first time is dyed a dull black, and surprisingly master costume designer Walter Plunkett whose credits included ""Gone with the Wind"", puts her in very dowdy, matronly outfits which don't flatter her at all.  You can see the toll her addiction to prescription drugs and her personal demons have taken on her, Ms. Garland was only twenty seven years old at time of filming but at times she looks ten years older.  Gone forever is the delicate beauty she displayed in ""Presenting Lily Mars"", ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", ""The Clock"" and ""The Harvey Girls"" among others.

For Gene Kelly with ""Cover Girl"", ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""On the Town"" under his belt in a way this movie was a step backward.  However remembering how kind and supportive Judy had been to him when he was neophyte making his first movie with her ""For Me and My Gal"", Kelly was ready to repay his debt to her.  With his black Irish handsomeness and relaxed virility Gene Kelly is the ideal partner for Judy Garland, both bringing out the best in each other.  Their most ambitious number together is called ""Portland Fancy"" which is a type of challenge dance between the two, with Garland more than keeping up with Kelly, matching his intricate choreography flawlessly.  Still, the more memorable duet for my money is the lowed-keyed, enchanting ""You Wonderful You"", with the couple alone on the stage of the deserted barn, where Joe introduces Jane to show business and they sing and dance together for the first time.  It's simply and charmingly done as together they create magic, very similar to their ealier improvised duet of ""For Me and My Gal"" in their first film together.

The big number for Kelly is the solo he dances to the reprise of ""You, Wonderful You"" where using such simple effects as a creaking floorboard and a sheet of newspaper he gets to show off the innovation and virtuosity of his flashing feet.

Curiously, speaking of musical numbers in the film, one of the most awful stinkers in MGM's musical history is followed by one of the most brilliant, that is still immortal sixty four years later.  The first is ""Heavenly Music"", and talk about your misnomers.  It's this totally dreadful ""comedy"" song that Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers get to mug and ham it up as dim witted blacked out toothed hillbillies with huge phony bare feet complete with the din of many howling dogs. Since Phil Silvers had recently starred in a big Broadway musical hit ""High Button Shoes"", and was a comic I suspect this number was put in for him, but it's certainly no showcase for his talents.  Frankly,it's Gene Kelly's worst number on film, and I wonder if he winced whenever he saw it.  Take my advice & use the fast forward button, it's painful to both watch and hear.

Mercifully, just after they're off the stage, the orchestra strikes some strong, dramatic chords, and the curtains part to reveals a chorus of tuxedo clad men who cavort frenetically about the stage for a few moments before each consecutively falling flat on the floor. As the last man drops a soignee, sexy Judy Garland is revealed, clad in a brief men's tuxedo jacket with a white ascot wrapped around her throat. A black fedora is perched saucily on her brow; her slim legs clad in sheer black stockings and high heels look fantastic as she's framed against a painted backdrop of white clouds in a dawn pink sky. With the men's corps of dancers backing her up, she zestfully sails into Harold Arlen's ""Get Happy"" and turns it into a showstopper.  Renowned playwright Edward Albee recalled seeing this film in it's first release in Manhattan, and at the conclusion of this song, the whole audience burst into sustained applause!  This solo was added after the film was finished when it was felt Judy Garland needed a strong number in the show.  Garland agreed but on the condition that the number was ""Get Happy"" which she had always longed to perform.  Musical director Saul Chaplin came up with this arrangement which she loved and director Charles Walters the inspired choreography.  Relaxed and refreshed after a long vacation, Ms. Garland had dropped close to twenty pounds and looked wonderful, and was in fine form musically as well.  Many people mistakenly thought that this was a number filmed much earlier, but it is the final musical number of Ms. Garland's film career at MGM, and what a way to go out!  It's one of the best things she's ever done on film.

Able support is given by Eddie Bracken, Phil Silvers, Gloria DeHaven, Marjorie Main and Hans Conreid, but the film is securely Judy Garland's and Gene Kelly's.  Charles Walters, the long suffering director under the circumstances delivers sterling work.  Supposedly after viewing the final result, Walters was astonished it came off as so light hearted and breezy after all the stress during filming!

Among the extras, the best feature is the short feature ""Summer Stock: Get Happy"" about the making of the film which has memories of cast members Gloria DeHaven, Carleton Carpenter, musical director Saul Chaplin and noted Judy Garland author John Fricke.

As the summer winds to a close in these last few weeks, add this to your list of summer pleasures to be experienced at least once.",1408838400,,8856,4.747389033942559

402072,5,6301978501,"You haven't lived until you've seen Judy Garland, wearing overalls and high heeled loafers(really), driving a tractor through the countryside singing, ""Howdy Neighbor! Happy Harvest!"" at the top of her lungs.  The number ends with a close up of Judy and the expression on her face seems to say, ""I can't believe I sang that song either!"".  It's that kind of good natured goofiness that makes ""Summer Stock"", Garland's last movie for MGM, so enjoyable.  The plot is a grown up version of, ""Hey kids, let's put on a show in the barn!"".  Except for Gene Kelly's classic ""newspaper"" dance and Judy's iconic ""Get Happy"" the songs and dances are pleasant but forgettable.  And the humor is predictible:  city slickers who wreck tractors, don't know how to feed chickens, and think cows milk themselves.  What makes ""Summer Stock"" so much fun is, well, a sense of fun.  Everyone seems to be having plenty of it.  And that everybody is a roll call of some of Hollywood's best character actors:  Ray Collins, Phil Silvers, Eddie Bracken, Hans Conreid, the underrated Carleton Carpenter, and everybody's favorite raucous old battleaxe, Marjorie Main.  ""Stock"" was supposedly a difficult shoot.  Garland was at her lowest point and the three week schedule stretched into nine months.  But if anyone was weary of the thing these pros never let it show.  The movie moves at a fast pace thanks to the direction of Charles Walters.  And Walters deserves a shout out for keeping Gene Kelly's hamminess under control.  Kelly has a few moments but Walters reels him in nicely.  It's Kelly's most reflective performance.  The one sour note:  Judy's costumes by Walter Plunkett.  The normally brilliant Plunkett was obviously trying to disguise Garland's weight gain(she's quite heavy) but he only manages to make her loook dumpy and matronly.  And Garland has the dubious honor of wearing what just may be the ugliest dress in movie history.  Her evening gown in the ""It's All for You"" number is a bunchy mess of lace and taffeta drowning in frou-frou.  Poor Judy looks like she lost a fight with her granny's parlor curtains.  Other than the wardrobe, ""Summer Stock"" is a delight, a fitting swan song for MGM's most beautiful swan.",1397692800,4,2213,4.902964959568733

402077,5,6301978501,"What cannot be said of Judy Garland?  Okay, she didn't read music, but her ear was perfect.  Play a song right through one time, and she'd be singing it the second time.  Not tentatively either, but at full belt where the song called for it.
As a dancer she was not the equal of Astaire or Kelly or O'Connor, but nobody else was either.  And, when she danced with one of those guys, you watched her and not her partner.  It's been said that neither Astaire nor Kelly had any other partners so riveting.
Playing a role, any role, she was a magnet for your attention.  That cannot be taught or learned.  It's not the result of practice or rehearsal.  It isn't ability, or skill, or talent.  It's more like magic, and it's very rare, at least in the measure that she had it.
How do you look up to a person so tiny, less than five feet tall?  Show-girls are mostly biggish people, beautiful on a grand scale.  Not Judy Garland!  Unlike most stars, she was pretty ordinary-looking off-camera.
Toward the beginning of ""Summer Stock,"" she sings a number while supposedly driving a tractor.  Judy (not the tractor) is likely to pull you right out of your seat.
Toward the end of the film, she does ""Get Happy,"" and it alone is worth the price of the DVD.  The story is told that she'd been sick for a few days before they shot the number, and that she did it in two takes with no break.  Cast and crew (those jaded, busy people) were applauding as she finished it.

Little orphan country girl (Ms. Garland)  trying to keep the family farm going,  has a down and out summer theatrical troupe imposed  on the her and the  farm 'cause the show cannot afford to  go anywhere else.  Never mind the plot; you're watching the inimitable Gene Kelly at his best.  Kelly and Garland both were the Whole Package; they could act, they could sing, and the dancing (if you like taps) is as good as it gets, in an age when great  dancers were  common (think Rita Hayworth).

In the show, Judy Garland plays the tractor-driving hayseed in overalls, until she joins the show in her barn at the last minute, to fill in her for her absconding sister. Garland performs  the hit  ""Come on, Get Happy!"" in a slinky black tuxedo outfilt, high heels, and stingy brim hat...At that point you learn (if you didn't know it already)  that her legs went up to her shoulders, or at least that's what it looks like.

Vocally, Garland is tops, and she's quite the dancer, too.  She certainly hadn't danced so energetically with Astaire.

No need to rehash the problematical production, or the sniff-boo-hoo noises others make when they say, ad nauseum, that this was Garland's last MGM film.  Well, after 15 years, she should've left anyway.  What was there to keep her?  ""Royal Wedding""?  ""The Belle of New York""?  Lousy films and not worthy of her.

It is hard to imagine Mickey Rooney in the Gene Kelly role, though it was originally planned that way.  By this time (1950), Rooney was not ""box office"", but Kelly certainly was.  His dance with the newspaper to ""You Wonderful You"" is a very interesting and inventive dance.  The score itself may be lacking (""Friendly Star"", ""Howdy Neighbor"" ""Beautiful Music"") but Garland's vocal ability is amazing.  And of course, ""Get Happy"", the stand-out and unforgettable number that she does in an otherwise typical musical.  She looks great.  She sounds great.  She dances great.

402181,4,6301978501,"SUMMER STOCK is one of those films that is more famous for its backstory than for itself.

Judy Garland's private life was turbulent.  In the 1940s she began to abuse prescription medication.  Her first marriage to composer David Rose ended amidst rumors that she had become pregnant and the studio demanded she have an abortion in order to continue filming.  Her second marriage to director Vincent Minnelli was a successful artistic partnership but a personal disaster.  Although she rejoiced in the 1946 birth of daughter Liza, the pregnancy touched off a devastating bout of what we now call post-partum depression, and in 1947 Garland suffered a major breakdown, temporary institutionalization, and may have received shock treatment.  Garland had long resented her studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but after her breakdown her attitude toward MGM seemed to undergo a negative shift of seismic proportions; even so, in the late 1940s Garland gave successful and popular performances in THE PIRATE, EASTER PARADE, WORDS AND MUSIC, and IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMER TIME.  She was then assigned to a truly spectacular role: the lead in a film adaptation of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN--but by this point Garland was using drugs on a massive scale, was unable to function on the set, and was fired from the movie and replaced by Betty Hutton, on loan from her home studio of Paramount.  Hutton would later comment that filming ANNIE GET YOUR GUN put an end to her desire to ever make another film: she found the working conditions at MGM every bit as brutal as Garland had.

After some recovery time, Garland went into the motion picture SUMMER STOCK.  It is a mixture of nostalgia and Americana, a throw-back to the ""let's put on a show"" movies Garland had done with Mickey Rooney in the 1930s.  The story concerned a female farmer named Jane (Garland) who is engaged to local boy Orville Wingait (Eddie Bracken.)  All seems well until Jane's stage-struck sister Abigail (Gloria DeHaven) turns the farm's barn over to a summer stock company lead by Joe Ross (Gene Kelly) and Herb Blake (Phil Silvers.)  Jane agrees to the arrangement in exchange for help with the farm chores--but of course complications soon abound and like it or not she soon finds herself in the show and in love with Joe.  Marjorie Main and Ray Collins lend memorable support, Kelly's choreography is a knock-out, Garland's vocals are knock-outs, and experienced director Chuck Walters keeps everything moving at a pleasant pace.  The film is most particularly remembered for three musical numbers: the song ""Friendly Star"" by Garland, the so-called ""Newspaper Dance"" by Kelly, and most particularly ""Get Happy,"" which proved an iconic moment for Garland as she strode sharply in a tux and fedora through dark-clad chorus boys against and pink sunset sky.  But everyone involved found the process of making the film to be absolute hell, and the reason was the movie's leading lady: Judy Garland.

Garland's marriage to Minnelli was ending and she was again using drugs; she would show up late; she would not show up at all.  Filming was chaotic and the schedule dragged on and on so long that chorus boys and girls actually left to do other films and then returned again to work on SUMMER STOCK.  Any other star would have been fired, but by this point studio boss Louis B. Mayer had begun to grasp that he and the studio were to some extent responsible for Garland's meltdown, having overworked her for a decade; Gene Kelly felt he owed Garland, who had taken him as a co-star in FOR ME AND MY GAL when he was a virtual unknown; and so everyone lined up behind her to get the picture made.  And it was uphill all the way, with everyone concerned describing it as a truly hellish experience.  The film finished--and a month or two later the studio decided it needed another number for Garland.  At this point Garland was in better shape both physically and mentally, and she shot the complicated ""Get Happy"" number in a single day.  But it was the last time Garland and MGM would put up with each other.  Promised a long vacation, Garland was called back to the studio to go into ROYAL WEDDING when leading lady June Allyson discovered she was pregnant.  Garland balked, the pattern of passive-aggressive behavior began to reassert itself, the studio refused to endure another situation like SUMMER STOCK, and not only did MGM fire Garland from the film, it fired her from the studio as well.  There was a suicide attempt, not the first and not the last; there was a lot of bad publicity; and although SUMMER STOCK opened to good reviews and good business, Judy Garland's career as a major motion picture star was over.

She would go on to a memorable career as a concert artist, a television performer, and she would make several more films, including the legendary A STAR IS BORN.  Even so, Garland was never able to shake a simmering resentment toward the entertainment industry, which she felt had mistreated her financially, emotionally, and physically.  As time passed this attitude made her increasingly difficult to work with.  There were concert cancellations, a horrendous battle with CBS over her short-lived but critically lauded television series, and a handful of films--but during her last motion picture, I COULD GO ON SINGING, she was so difficult to work with that the cast and crew of that film referred to her as ""It.""  But...  The thing is, you'd never know any of this from watching her.

SUMMER STOCK is not a great film, but it is a fun film, an enjoyable film, and Garland is in fine voice--although, as many have noted, her weight fluctuates a great deal from scene to scene.  But it doesn't matter.  She's Judy Garland.  And that was always the point.

For instance Judys Get happy number is brilliant and i do think that is why the movie is so hyped. I also really enjoyed phil silvers with gene kelly with heavenly music and Genes solo dancing with a squeaky board and a news paper.

With such good musical numbers why only three stars? Well I just felt that in the entire movie Judy her character feels labored somehow, as if she is trying too hard or is too tired to really be doing this movie. the movie feels forced in parts because phil silvers needs a staring moment again or someone else needs a bit of lime light. Possibly this is due to having too many big names in this movie. On the whole i felt it was a bit slow and lacked the usual energy. If you want a ""lets put on a show movie"" i think the ones Judy did with mickey rooney when they were younger like girl crazy are more energetic.",1302134400,,959,4.128342245989304

First off, the movie is in beautiful condition. Not grainy or anything, audio is perfection.

In Summer Stock, Garland plays Jane Falbury (in her final MGM picture), a farm owner more than a bit riled when her aspiring-actress (Gloria De Haven) shows up with a theatrical troupe that wants to stage a musical in the family barn. Though she doesn't want to do it, she agrees to it after a while on the condition that they must help her with the farm chores. Soon afterwards, the sister leaves, and Jane has to fill in her spot. And throughout the making of the musical, Jane and Joe D. Ross (Gene Kelly) fall in love. There are some beautiful moments throughout the movie (besides Gene's dance with the board and newspaper, and Judy's number with ""Get Happy), you've got Gene and Judy's first duet, Phil Silvers comic bits, and the destruction of Jane's tractor (which in my opninon is hilarious)

You'll love the movie, and in today's economy, if you do buy this you can have the satisfaction that you're not wasting your money. And if you have kids, it's something that they, too, would enjoy.",1274572800,,1290,4.5085470085470085

402223,5,6301978501,"Summer Stock was Judy Garland's last film at MGM. She had troubles getting to the set everyday, and MGM finally reached it's breaking point. The film also starred Gene Kelly, and the two of them created on-screen magic. This is a high energy, slightly cock-eyed idea of, 'Hey kids! Why don't we find ourselves a barn and put on a show!' But just when you think that MGM can't come up with abother variation on that theme they do, and it's a fun and entertaining show for the whole family. One note: In Judy Garland's final song, ""Get Happy"", MGM was accused of using an old clip of her. It does seem plausible, because she seems quite a bit heavier in the film as compared to how she appears to look in that song. The truth is, that song was made for Summer Stock, but there was a 4 month gap in the filming. In those 4 months, she lost nearly 40 pounds. This will always be one of my favorites, because of the interaction of all of the lesser actors as well as the major. Gene Kelly is at the top of his mark in this one, proving that even a piece of paper can be a great prop. 5 stars, overwhelming approval!",1253232000,3,1110,4.191588785046729
402224,4,6301978501,"SUMMER STOCK was Judy's final film for MGM.  She made it for the Pasternak unit, as the folks in the Freed unit had all but given up on her after she couldn't re-team with Fred Astaire for BARKELEYS OF BROADWAY and was forced out of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.  Her last two complete films for the studio (GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME and this one) were for producer Pasternak who made decidedly lower budget, less high brow fare.  This is not the material Judy should have been forced into, but her last years at MGM were tough and she was locked in a dizzying downward spiral due to health woes, a deteriorating marriage, the addiction and a studio that was less than generous or understanding with one of their greatest talents.

As a film, it's merely OK.  It's not worthy of Judy's talents and Gene Kelly did it as a favor because he never forgot how good Judy had been to him on his film debut in FOR ME AND MY GAL, 9 years earlier.  The plot is quite similar to the old Mickey/Judy barn musicals (yes, there's literally a barn here, too) and the whole affair is a bit tired.  The sequence of Judy on the tractor singing ""Happy Harvest"" is telling enough...I've read stories about Judy up on the tractor, exhausted and unsteady, and asking them to summon ""Vincente so he could take her home.""  In watching that sequence, she looks fine and all, but the coverage doesn't match up between shots and I think they simply got what they got and moved on.

All of that said, the film does overcome its story, script and plot points and succeed because of the talents of Judy & Gene.  They shine.  They're consummate professionals and they can take the tired material and raise it up 20 notches.  Judy's solos are all good.  Gene's work is its usual terrific.  And together, in ""You Wonderful, You"" or the dance they do, they once again elevate the whole affair.

The finale, of course, contains the now legendary ""Get Happy.""  Shot after production had wrapped weeks earlier, Judy had taken a long-needed vacation, she'd shed some pounds (at 4'11"", even losing 5 pounds showed up on her) and she came back fit and relaxed.  They decided they needed one more solo for Judy (she had opted out of the Hillbilly number that Gene and Phil Silvers ended up doing) and someone suggested Harold Arlen's ""Get Happy"" and the rest is history.  It goes through four key changes and Judy learned the song and the dance routine in short order and it was shot.  She was sexy and very grown up and sophisticated (not in keeping with the plot because, honestly, her character couldn't have done ALL THAT...but who cares...it's an MGM musical after all!).

In the voiceover during ""That's Entertainment,"" Liza herself said, ""Summer Stock was mama's final film for MGM and her last days of shooting here were devoted to this number, which a lot of people, including myself, feel was one of her very best.""  She's right.  Everyone who loves this number is right.

Judy went out with a bang and her 15-year stint at MGM was over.  It would four years before she made another movie and in the months after leaving MGM, her reputation was such that she found it difficult to find work.  She had no recording contract, no movie contract and hadn't yet returned to the concert stage.  Bing Crosby had her on his radio show numerous times in those months (those songs are terrific) and she worked to re-build her image and her career, culminating with the huge successes in London and at the Palace in New York, before returning to Hollywood to make ""A Star is Born"" over at Warner Bros.",1235520000,4,3543,4.548895899053628

402227,5,6301978501,"""Summer Stock"" has always been one of my favorite movies. Because it's the type of old movie that everyone can enjoy. There's singing and dancing and lots of laughs and drama and theatrics. In this picture Miss Judy Garland (may she rest in peace) stars as Jane Falbury, a farmer who reluctantly allows a theater company to stay on at her farm to rehearse for their big performance. I know the story is a little hockey, but does that matter, really?

This is the very first time I ever saw a picture with Mr. Gene Kelly (playing the male lead, Joe Ross) and he was absolutely perfect. Anyone could tell that there was a lot of magic and chemistry between him and Miss Garland because when they were on the screen together it was always amazing to watch.

My favorite part in the movie is at the end when Jane does her big ""Get Happy"" number. I couldn't believe how different Miss Garland appeared because it wasn't just different makeup and lightening, she managed to change her entire appearance and she looked beautiful (as, always).

To me, this movie has always been a reminder to be kind and compassionate to others. To love my fellow (wo)man and not to judge others in haste. To remember that we're all entitled to the same dignity and respect. And perhaps most important ""Summer Stock"" taught me that sometimes in life things don't always turn out the way we envisioned and you know what, that's OK, too.

Like the star Miss Garland herself, absolutely everyone will fall in love with this film. If you haven't seen ""Summer Stock"" what are you waiting for? Go out and get the DVD, or if your pinching a few pennies these days (and who isn't?) just wait for it to come on TCM (it usually comes on at least once every other month).

There has never been another entertainer, performer, singer, dancer, actress, comedienne and shero than the one and only Miss Judy Garland. This is her movie.",1222905600,,1896,4.564705882352941
402228,5,6301978501,My 4 yr old son is in love with Judy Garland. She is immortal & ageless in films. He also Loves Elvis. We rented this film from our library soo many times that I decided it was time to purchase it! I love encouraging my children to see old films like this one. They don't make movie stars like they used to!,1207526400,,307,3.967741935483871
402229,4,6301978501,"Judy Garland and Gene Kelly star in this extravagantly entertaining backstage musical. Jane Falbury (Garland) is a simple farmer whose major worry is how she is going to make enough money to keep her family farm. Her younger sister Abigail (Gloria deHaven) isn't like the rest of her family; she's taken with show business, so much so, in fact, that she brings her acting troupe back home to perform in the barn. Jane isn't too happy about the decision, but is soon charmed by the ambitious bunch and agrees to let them stay on the condition that they earn their keep. Abigail's boyfriend Joe Ross (Kelly) leads the group and does his best to win Jane over, with extreme results.

Garland's appearance is a bit jarring here. For a girl who was given only chicken broth to eat for years, her physique is quite healthy here, but she is no less beautiful than in her early days. In fact there are times when she is even more beautiful because she looks happy and comfortable in this film. Some of that comes from her vulnerability, which indeed was real. She was suffering from severe drug addiction during the making of Summer Stock. The most memorable song is the famous ""Get Happy"" that she skillfully puts over; her weight is different here because it was filmed later than the rest of the movie. Garland's chemistry with Kelly is intense, and he looks more attractive here than in any other film I have seen him in. His easy smile and magnetic charm makes show business seem wonderfully worthwhile, and with this music and these characters, it is hard not to want to perform right along with the stars on the screen.",1199232000,2,1618,4.618055555555555
402230,5,6301978501,"Much has been written about the troubles on this production; how Judy's illnesses forced delay after delay...so long that even the supporting dancers would move onto other projects. None of this shows on screen. Garland's vocals are strong, and the songs she sings are memorable. Her Portland Fancy dance duet with Gene Kelly makes you wish they had more opportunities to work together; it has to be one of the top dance duets filmed at MGM. She more than keeps up with him, and it is Judy that your eye is drawn to as you watch the two of them. Her solo song, ""Friendly Star"" is heartbreaking, especially the tearful closeup at the end. Sure, the plot is predictable, and a little hokey at times, but with a strong supporting cast and a witty script, this delightful movie could be enjoyed over and over again. The ""Get Happy"" number is a fantastic showstopper that is among the most memorable and sadly, her last filmed number at MGM.",1189036800,,936,4.610778443113772
402231,4,6301978501,"Despite the goofy plot of a Broadway-style production in a barnyard, SUMMER STOCK is the movie I have been searching for. This is the one where ever-animated Joe D. Ross (Gene Kelly) does his dance with the newspaper, neatly halving and quartering it with his toes. New England farmer Jane Falbury (Judy Garland)  is all grown up as she taps her heels to prove there is no place like home. Herb Blake (Phil Silvers) provides supporting slapstick joke and dance routines to round out the hour and 49 minutes of musical romance.

This crisp and bright color film transfer immortalizes Garland's final film for MGM and the last onscreen pairing of her and Gene Kelly. SUMMER STOCK and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COVER-GIRL/dp/B00009ZPU1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COVER GIRL</a>&nbsp;are two movies that really demonstrate the agility and creative genius of Gene Kelly. While the paper tearing in SUMMER STOCK is smooth, his power, rhythm, and balance during the song ""Dig! Dig! Dig!"" are electrifying.

Noticeably a few pounds lighter in her post-production shoot of the apparently prophetic ""Judgment Day"" lines in the ""Get Happy"" grand finale routine, Garland presents one of the most memorable performances of her career. In the same year, she was terminated from MGM.

Gene's obvious respect and concern for Judy is so obvious throughout.  One of the most tender moments ever occurs during ""You, Wonderful You"".  And what words could adequately describe Gene's performance on the squeeky board number?  This is one of my favorites and a must have in any Gene Kelly collection.",1168387200,3,502,5.160493827160494

402248,5,6301978501,"Judy Garland was THEE entertainer of the 20th Century!  Watching this fun-filled, tune-fest one can't believe that it was her last MGM picture (she was fired after this due to consitent tardiness and personal problems).  Its amazing to watch Judy here as by this time her life was riddled with severe emotional problems.  It seems impossible to be true when you see the energy, joy and love she puts into everything she does on screen.  She's just marvelous!!  The ""Get Happy"" number is a show-stopper as is her wonderful ""tractor number Howdy Neighbor""!  No less sensational is Gene Kelly who does some of the best dancing of his career!  There's a marvelous dance with bits of newspaper that is unbelievable!  The supporting cast can't be bettered with talents like Marjorie Main, Phil Silvers, Carleton Carpenter, Eddie Bracken and Gloria DeHaven.  This is first rate MGM entertainment filmed at the time of the beginning of the demise of the studio system.  Pure escapism at its finest, ""Summer Stock"" is one for the ages.  Shine on Judy and Gene!  I love it!",1152489600,8,1063,4.844444444444444
402249,5,6301978501,"Other reviewers have mentioned how lucky Judy was to have Gene for a friend.  I agree.  Looking at the two of them you could see the trust and friendship in their eyes.  Gene holding her gently with caring hands.  Judy warbling beautifully with a hint of sadness, an almost knowing in her eyes.  I feel they were lucky to have each other.  It was Judy Garland who lobbied hard 10 years earlier for Gene to co-star in "" For Me And My Gal"".

  ""Summer Stock"" is that usual bit-o-MGM musical fluff.  The same bit-o-fluff that Judy had spun into gold so many times before as in ""Girl Crazy"", ""Easter Parade"", and the like. It's every bit as good and wholesome family entertainment as Judy and MGM made before, but knowing it was to be her MGM swan song, and the cause of her ultimate rebirth, makes it that much more special and important.

  Previous readers mentioned how Kelly would move on to more prestigious endeavors.  I would like to mention, so too, Judy.  She would only make a handful more precious pictures, but in them were some gems.  She would recieve her only adult Oscar nominations for a supporting actress role in ""Judgement at Nuremburg,"" and of course for her ultimate star turn as Esther Blodgett in ""A Star Is Born.""  Isn't it funny how she could get such roles and recieve such recognition only away from MGM.

  Post MGM  Judy would continue to perform on radio including ""The Bob Hope Show,"" and ""The Bing Crosby Show.""  She would go on to record and sell millions of albums.  Her guest starring on, and her own television specials were highly rated, and ultimately preluded  her much revered and highly acclaimed ""The Judy Garland Show.""  For you hipsters out there, she was an original member of the Holmby Hills ""Rat Pack."" But to me, it was her rebirth as a concert diva,artist/singer that showed she had the courage, talent and strength to leave her MGM years behind and forge new ground.  She made over a thousand stage appearances. Here are some of her highlights:

  *1951 A 4 week engagement at the London Palladium followed by a 6 week extended tour of the British Isles.
  *1951 Her legendary record breaking 19 week 2-a-day engagement at New Yorks' famed Palace Theater.
  *1952 4 week engagement at the Philharmonic Auditorium in Los Angeles.
  *1961 Legendary Carnegie Hall performance remembered as the greatest single night in show business.(This concert was taped and later released as a double album. It was the first double album to sell a million copies.  It stayed on the charts 94 weeks, 13 weeks at #1 and won 5 Grammy awards including best female vocalist and Album of the Year!)
  *1967 Boston Common Concert performed before an estimated audience of 100,000 people.

  In 1949, after being fired from ""Annie Get Your Gun,""  top MGM management was ready to toss her to the wolves.  Judy was broke, and LB Mayer took it upon himself to see Judy got proper medical treatment that ultimately MGM payed for.  Hospitalized, Judy had to relearn how to eat and sleep properly without the use if pills and as a result she got well, but gained weight.  Many viewers have harped on her appearance.  I agree with a previous reviewer that @ a mere 105 pounds, on Judy, it looks healthy.

  Judy, emotionally and physically well again wanted to work, and after the success of ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" MGM was only too eager to oblige.  The studio ordered her to lose weight thus restarting that vicious cycle of crash dieting, pill-popping, and all those insecurities and professional problems of the past started to creep back in again.

  The MGM brass wasn't pleased with the final picture.  Judy, vacationing in Carmel, was called back to bring in a show stopper.  Judy agreed as long as it could be ""Get Happy.""  It's obvious that the result was show business magic and that the ""Get Happy"" number a fitting swan song for Judy.  Everyone thought that the ""Get Happy"" number was most likely filmed earlier on in her career.  Wrong-o.  On vacation, free from harassment from the studio and the press, the pounds had simply melted away on their own.  Although Judy was actually terminated from MGM while filming ""Royal Wedding,"" this was officially her last MGM picture.  Goodbye MGM. Hello Mrs. Norman Maine?

402272,5,6301978501,"...and sing and dance as much as possible when the artists are of the caliber of Garland and Kelly.  Never considered one of the great musicals in the league of Meet Me In St. Louis, Singing In the Rain, A Star Is Born, or The Bandwagon, Summer Stock is still a ton of fun to experience and contains some of the finest musical (and comedic) moments of both Garland and Kelly.  Garland is excellent as farmer Falbury and looks the part to perfection with her added weight and frumpy hair style.  It's hard to remember another musical film that gets off to such a joyous start as this one, with Garland's infectious ""If You Feel Like Singing, Sing"" number setting the tone for the entire film to follow.  Garland is in total command in this film and it's difficult to believe from viewing the finished work that she was actually quite ill during the making of it.  One highpoint is the exuberant ""Howdy Neighbor (Happy Harvest)"" number where, riding a tractor and singing her guts out, she holds a long note at the end of the song, popping her eyes out and making a face directly to us!  Scenes like this, her interplay with greats Marjorie Main and Eddie Bracken, demonstrate Garland's superb comedic timing and flawless ways of reacting to other performers in a scene.  Garland and Kelly were a dynamite screen team and it's a pity they only made three films together.  Their dance in the barn to the ""Portland Fancy"" is a super exciting number, and their first rendition of ""You Wonderful You"", also in the barn, is so filled with tenderness and joy - both of them beautiful to look at.  As for the ""Get Happy"" number, simply one of the finest musical numbers ever filmed: Judy & her bevy of chorus boys all decked-out in their black tuxedos with her justly famous long and shapely legs moving about the stage to that great Arlen melody.

If You Feel Like Singing, Sing- Judy sings this right at the beginning of the movie.

Happy Harvest- Judy sings this number also.

Dig-Dig-Dig-Dig for Your Dinner- This is sung by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers and the chorus.

Mem'ry Island- Gloria DeHaven sings this song with a guy as part of the show.

Country Barn Dance- Judy and Gene dance to this country barn dance music and then it heats up!

You Wonderful You- Gene sings this to Judy and then Judy joins him. Later on Gene dances to this song.

Friendly Star- Judy sings this song.

All for You- Gene and Judy sing this as song as part of their show with a chorus.

Heavenly Music- Gene and Phil sing and dance to this song. I heard Judy Garland was actually supposed to do this number also but she wasn't well at the time. A fun number.

Get Happy- The best number in the whole movie! One of Judy's signiture songs and looks. She looks so sexy in that man's fedora, suit jacket and black tights. See the movie just for this number!

Surprisingly enough Judy does a great job keeping up with Gene in their dance scenes together, and Gene's solos are amazing. Also, Judy's famed solo, 'Get Ready' is in this movie as well.

28 year old Judy Garland stars as the hard working, determined, Jane Falbury. Who really just wants to run her farm. Or does she...

Chaos ensues when Jane comes home one morning to find 24 (Though it looks more like 50 on screen) people loading props, lights, and costumes into her much loved barn. Angry, overwhelmed, and upset, Jane is dumbfounded when she finds out her beautiful, ambitious, sister (Gloria DeHaven), has invited her boyfriend's show, (Gene Kelly), to put on his show: 'Fall in Love,' in which her sister is to play the leading part. Jane angrily tells them to leave. But when Jane's sister, Abigail, tells Jane she is selfish, Jane changes her mind and says that the actors may stay - on one condition: they must help her with the farm chores!!!

This movie contiues as Jane falls head over heels with Joe Ross (Gene Kelly), and show business.

Other cast includes: Marjorie Main, Carleton Carpenter, Phil Silvers and Ray Collins.

Other songs include: If you fell like singing sing, Howdy Neighbor, Memory Island, You Wonderful You, Get Happy, Dig, There's a star, and the HILARIOUS, routine with Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers: It's Heavenly Music To ME!!

402301,5,6301978501,With Judy Garland struggling in her life during this time this movie holds a special place in my heart. A large fan of Judy Garland and Gene Kelly I decided to watch this one day on TCM...well lets just say from the number with Judy on the tractor to her closing Get Happy number I was hooked. I fell in love with the performances given by the two along with the rest of the cast...with some great songs...and a few not so great...it still ends up being a great movie.

402302,5,6301978501,"This movie was a treat to watch and I am so excited about this movie I am starting to write this review even as the VCR is rewinding the tape! GRIN Garland, Kelly, Silvers, DeHaven and fantastic other cast members give a strong, convincing performance in the movie Summer Stock. The script is well written; yes, though the plot is not the deepest, and to an extent predictable, the lines are thoughtfully written. The musical numbers are fantastic and include superb scenes where Kelly dances as well as Judy's infamous ""Get Happy"" number. (One exception is the number at the end with Silvers and Kelly dancing and singing as farmhands--not too special a musical number in my opinion.) It seems that Judy's character owns and runs a farm--in debt--and Kelly playing Joe brings his acting troupe to try out a new show and stake a claim in show business. Of course, after some complications--and romantic partner swapping--the show goes on and is a tremendous success. Happy Ending! Judy's great performance in her final completed film at MGM is truly remarkable in light of her poor health at the time. (However I must say that although it could just be my imagination, Judy looks a bit skinnier in some scenes in the film than she does in other scenes. Could this reflect her possibly losing or gaining weight during the time this movie was filmed?) In short, this film is a very fine addition to any serious movie buff's collection, especially if part of the collection includes musicals. Get this film--Amazon lists it as out of stock for a GOOD reason! Tons of people bought this movie and you'll GET HAPPY when you see this!",1084838400,28,1628,4.735915492957746
402303,4,6301978501,"This is the last film Judy did for Metro...
Sadly it is an echo of the Mickey/Judy films of 1939-1943 of putting on a show at high speed...
Still, Gene and Judy turn in good performances and the finale is
all to much over-looked in retrospective clips. GET HAPPY stands out - it is a hint of the greatness Garland would achive on stage and TV in years 2 come...
Unlike other musical stars, Judy gives a performance of nuance and depth - quite unlike ALL OTHER musical stars of her era.",1064707200,,485,4.282608695652174
402304,4,6301978501,"The gent from Austraila makes some great points about Ms. Garland's background with MGM and how they frequently pushed her talents to the breaking point while abusing her health- and then ultimately trying to blame her for being suspended from the studio. That said, this is a good one, albeit a corny one. The hillbilly stuff done with Phil Silvers and some of the gypsies is a bit much, but the film shows off Garland's immense talent for low-key, witty comedy. And ""Get Happy"" aside, the Portland Fancy group dance which turns into a toe-tapping swing duet with Garland and Gene Kelly is probably the most enjoyable moment of the whole film. (Considering Garland's strength was singing, her dancing was quite impressive.) And my favorite Garland solo is the moonlit, front-porch ballad ""Friendly Star,"" done almost all in closeup, with the star's beautiful dark eyes on the brink of tears through the whole number. It's a pleasant swan song for her MGM era, but thankfully, her greatest musical (A Star Is Born) was still yet to come.",1031270400,,1037,4.864406779661017

The best number in my mind is "" Get Happy"" which is performed by a tuxedo jacket and fedora clad judy she looks lovely and sings the song to it's fullest. Gene kelly also puts in one of the films best with his newspaper  dance to ""You Wonderful You"" one of my favorite Gene Kelly numbers  but that's just two of the numbers all the rest are wonderful too!

402307,3,6301978501,"After the humiliation of being fired from Annie Get Your Gun, Judy Garland was given a year off work and sent to a hospital in Boston, to primarily help her withdraw from the drug addiction that MGM had inadvertently created. That MGM agreed to pay her expenses is due to the waining influence of Louis B Mayer who was being outed by Dore Schary who the New York office had brought in as head of production.
In the MGM doco, When the Lion Roars, Schary had said that Garland refused the year off  - a blatant lie - which helped him perpertrate the myth that she was eventually fired from the studio because of unreliability. Garland herself also used the myth to present herself as a victim, even though the truth was she had asked for the separation of her contract. Garland had actually wanted to leave MGM when she married Vincente Minnelli in 1945 and move to New York. However Garland never had that year off, because after 3 months during which she endured the agonies of a amphetimine and barbituite withdrawal , the studio summoned her to begin production of Summer Stock.
This situation highlights the ironies of Garland's dilemma. As spectacularly talented as she was, she was just as spectacularly insecure, and used the drugs to both reduce her natural stocky build to a camera-attractive gautness, and boost her confidence. (The fact that the side effects of the kinds of drugs she was taking include depression is another irony). For their part, MGM knew what an asset Garland was, but treated her counter-productively. Extraordinaryly gifted artists require extraordinary consideration, but they continually and foolishly scheduled her to make back-to-back films, knowing that the making of the first would leave her physically and mentally exhausted. This was part of the reason she was unable to be her best for Annie Get Your Gun, having just finished In The Good Old Summertime. Then add hiring Busby Berekely to direct, a man Judy had come to hate after the way he abused a performance out of her for Girl Crazy.
Perhaps MGM's investment in her was limited to her output - imagine the money lost with her not working for a year?! Or perhaps the producer Joe Pasternak who had made Summertime thought it would help Garland save face after the relatively easy production of that film and the humiliation of Annie. However, back on the drugs in an effort to reduce weight to be ready for the camera, the scene was set for disaster. No matter how the studio tried to help Garland - by casting Gene Kelly as co-star, Easter Parade director Charles Walters, giving her half day calls, the drugs made her paranoid and hostile - hardly the best state of mind to perform in a musical.
Given all this, there are only slight indications of the production problems evident in the final film. Garland's additional weight that so concerned MGM seems barely an issue here. Even the after filmed Get Happy number where she had lost weight and returned, shows a minor difference, though what is more noticable is the standard of Get Happy versus the numbers previously filmed, as none of them match it. The only one that comes close is Garland's Friendly Skies. This number has her leaning against things as she sings, as apparently she could barely stand alone on the day of filming, according to Walters account. In Her Howdy Neighbour number where she rides a tractor, we get Garland's sense of self parody, and in the Portland Fancy number with Kelly, we see Garland's undervalued talent for dance. The extreme degree of Garland's hyper-emotionalism here, may be explained by her private mental state, but the anger has a context in her character's objection to Kelly and his Players invading her barn to put on their show. Her vocals on You Wonderful You and All for You are oddly offkey, but the closeup on her in the dialogue scene after Friendly Sky that Walters strangley freeze frames, shows Garland at her most touching. (Kelly's flat acting response to her reads like suppressed rage). Walters adds a lot of humour to the scene of the Players unpacking on the farm, Eddie Bracken's proposes to Garland with Ray Collins as intermediary, and a crossed conversation between Garland, Kelly and Phil Silvers upon news about Gloria DeHaven. There are two continuity errors - Kelly asks Garland how long she has been engaged twice, and we see Garland coming offstage after the Heavenly Music number which she doesn't appear in (It is said she was to be in it originally). Silvers and Bracken provide the broad cornball style of comedy MGM favoured, (they make Marjorie Main look subtle), with DeHaven the terrorfyingly bland musical comedy star of the future, and Kelly's ""kids"" a reaction against the country ""squares"". Their infiltration of the dance that leads to the Portland Fancy number changing from traditional to jazz may be justified in allowing Garland to show Kelly she can dance as well as he, but it mostly demonstrates youthful selfishness.
The VHS release features Garland's short Every Sunday, a ""tabloid musical"" directed by Felix E Feist, apparently made as a test to see whether the public responded more to Garland or her co-star Deanna Durbin. However the test is unbalanced, so much that one wonders whether it was re-edited after Garland found success and Durbin was released to go to Universal. Here Garland gets the better screen treatment. She is the protagonist, Durbin the reactor. Garland gets more lines, and her solo Americana is longer and more flatteringly edited. Garland has the hip song, is given closeups, and mingles with the musicians who perform at an outside concert, whilst Durbin sings an operatic piece, standing still, and is only seen in medium shot. Durbin probably has the better voice technically but Garland overwhelms her with charisma and audience empathy. The evidence of this short demystifies the myth that MGM executives were told to ""let the fat one go"". Anyway, Garland isn't even fat.",1000339200,5,5952,4.8698224852071
402308,4,6301978501,"This great movie centres around Jane Falbury (Judy Garland) and what happens when she allows her sister Abigail (Gloria De Haven) and her theatre troupe to use her barn to stage a musical.
Although initially hating the idea, it soon becomes apparent that Jane has 'greasepaint in her veins' when Abigail drops out and Jane has to perform in the lead role.
Along the way she falls for the handsome director (Gene Kelly) and decides that an acting career is what she longs for in life.
This was Judy's last MGM picture.  She was fired from the studio after her work in the musical ANNIE GET YOUR GUN was deemed terrible and she was replaced by Betty Hutton in the role. Later she would make her great comeback as Esther Blodgett in the musical version of A STAR IS BORN.",971654400,3,768,4.485714285714286

I would highly recommend this movie to a Judy Garland, Gene  Kelly or just a Classic Movie fan.  Even though this was Judy Garland's  last film at MGM, I think it was one of her best!  There was singing,  dancing, and great acting!  It is a great MGM musical!",963619200,5,420,4.074074074074074
402310,4,6301978501,"SUMMER STOCK is a very entertaining little picture which serves as a surprising showcase for the talents of Garland, Kelly, Eddie Bracken and Phil Silvers. Judy's little sister, DeHaven is an aspiring actress who brings her entire theatre company to work and live on Garland's farm....The only real bothersome thing about the film is that Judy's weight problem is starkly evident and obvious here (however, she did manage to shed 20 lbs. prior to the filming of the ""Get Happy"" finale and she looks sensational!) Garland and Kelly always played well together and this is no exception. Marjorie Main is her usual howl as Esme the loyal housekeeper/cook and Phil Silvers, Hans Conried and the obvious but funny Eddie Bracken are standouts. Even Judy's lesser-known numbers in this merry lark are delightful: the pleasantly corny ""Howdy Neighbor"" and the excellent ""Friendly Star"" among others. The ""Get Happy"" number is Liza Minnelli's all-time favourite of all of her mother's musical performances!",958694400,,997,5.2375

And if you love Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, it's all the  more so. Judy plays a country girl whose only interest is in running her  debt-ridden farm. She returns home one day to find her barn full of cows,  pigs, chickens...and actors, sets, and props. She learns that her sister  has permitted a troupe of theater actors, headed by Gene and Phil Silvers,  to perform a show in their barn. Judy complies on one condition: these  theater folk also support themselves by doing chores around the farm. But  picking eggs and milking cows aren't every man's fantasy, as Gene and Phil  learn. But in spite of a madcap hullaballoo on the farm, a love story  manages to intertwine itself between Judy and Gene... except for Judy being  engaged... and her sister in love with Gene... This is a marvelous movie  for anyone, young or old. Judy sings and struts the stuff that made her a  legend, particularly shining in a memorable number called, ""Get  Happy"". She croons ""You Wonderful You"" with Gene, who dances  at the top of his form... on newspapers. Gene and Phil do a hilarious  number called ""Heavenly Music"" in hillbilly attire, and the  finale ""Happy Harvest"" will have you smiling long after the  picture's over. With Judy Garland singing and Gene Kelly dancing, how can  you go wrong with this priceless piece of MGM treasure?

And the more I see it, the more I love the movie. The plot is  still silly, but it's cute, and on repeated viewings easier to enjoy. Gene  is really wonderful as Joe, and there are some great musical numbers in  this movie. Judy has the classic Get Happy. Then there is the funny  mock-rehearsal of Memory Island, Kelly dancing on the table, then later  dancing with a piece of paper in the imaginative newspaper/ squeaky board  routine. And Judy and Gene romancing each other with You Wonderful You.  There are some wonderfully sweet moments between the two of them. All in  all, a fun escape, with two classic talents.",954806400,,779,4.475177304964539
402324,5,6301978501,"This movie is a great fell-good love story. I've always thought that Gene kelly and Judy Garland have the most amazing on-screen chemistry and its ashame that they didn't do more than 6 films together. Judy, as usual gave  a great performance in all her numbers. May they be playful, riviting,  heartbreaking or just plain knock-outs, she did it great! As for Gene  Kelly, though he was not thrilled with the project, never let it show. He  gives absolutly amazing performances(like always) dancing in the barn with  Judy and in his newspaper dance. Although my favorite is the ""you  wonderful you"" number where Judy and Gene dance and sing  nice""n""easy under low lights on an empty stage.  It's so  beautiful seeing Gene holding Judy in those gorgeous arms of his. He holds  her like she was the love of his life and he never wanted to let go. You  can almost feel those hugs just watching them. I recommande this movie to  everyone and especialy Gene and Judy fans.",950486400,3,967,4.65680473372781

This enjoyable, if somewhat hokey, film offers one of the best musical moments Garland ever committed to film--""Get  Happy.""  In one of her trademark looks (a black coat and hat), Garland  stops the show with this number in the film's final moments.  Garland also  shines in an ""Over the Rainbow""-type ballad, ""Friendly  Star.""  Gene has a fine solo dance and partners with Garland in a  great barn dance sequence.  Character actress Marjorie Main and comedian  Phil Silver offer fine support.  Not just for the Garland fan, ""Summer  Stock"" is a fun film for fans of the MGM musicals of the 40s and 50s.",937008000,3,699,4.677685950413223

If you need to be  convinced of Garland's profundity, simply fast forward to the ""Get  Happy"" sequence, and groove on her intense showmanship, and lovely  legs.",931392000,,428,4.821917808219178
