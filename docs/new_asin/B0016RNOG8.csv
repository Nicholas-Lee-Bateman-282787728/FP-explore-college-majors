Buzz is probably the guru of elephant hunters. This film is high quality, with plenty of action. Highly recommended. As always purchasing from Amazon gives a little extra assurance that you receive your product.",1287187200,,359,4.714285714285714
8264141,5,B0016RNOG8,"I loved this safari DVD! These are some of the best non-traditional hunts you will see. Most safari DVD's don't have crocodile hunts, handgun hunts, bow and arrow hunts or problem elephant hunts. Problem elephant hunts benefit the local people 100% by the killing of a specific problem individual animal. I was impressed how the PH and client waited up all night in the fields for one elephant that raids crops and then they only hunt and kill that indiviudual elephant and they take no trophy at all. All the meat and hide etc. goes to the villagers to eat so it really benefits them. Lastly, the traditional safari footage is exciting with close calls and charges that are really fun to watch.",1265587200,2,695,4.658536585365853
