1676314,5,B00005YDDN,I purchased this DVD for my husband who has many Lionel trains since he was a boy. I was hoping to get the Lionel Christmas on DVD for we have it on VHS but it seems it was never transferred to that medium. I came across this instead. My husband absolutely loved it and as a matter of fact I who gets bored and usually walks out of the room when he watches train videos actually stayed and enjoyed it with him. The now late Tom Synder narrated it beautifully. It is two hours in length but it was not too long even for me. It was a nice way to share something my husband loves. I would definitely recommend buying this video.,1308960000,3,625,4.0894308943089435
1676315,5,B00005YDDN,"This is the most comprehensive video on the history of Lionel. It is a full 2 hours covering the evolution of Lionel from a tiny company in NY to the largest toy company in the world. With great video of the trains and accessories. Also has Lionel TV commercials from the 60s and 70s that are great fun to see. I have watched it over 20 times and really enjoy the intelligent yet fun commentary while hearing the story and seeing the Lionel products. The video was filmed in 2000 while Lionel still had their factory in Michigan. So, This video allows you to enjoy the story of the Great American Toy Train Company as it was.....AMERICAN!",1291766400,6,638,4.461538461538462

1676318,5,B00005YDDN,"This Video is an anniversary of the first 100 years of America's Favorite Model Train. Lionel! Tom Snyder hosts this special and this video shows the history of Lionel, some of the Classic Lionel Trains before World War II. This is actually containing two videos and in the second video, it shows the guy who brought back Lionel Trains, Richard Kughn. President of Lionel and it's Marketing. Also it shows some of Lionels biggest accessories too such as, the most favorite Milk Car, Water Tank, Cattle Car w/ loader to load cows. And also shows some old ads and what caught on the interest for Lionel trains. I got an old tin poster that my helping teacher gave me in 3rd Grade. It is the one from 1955 with a boy with his hands up and 6 trains below a bridge. I'm not much of a Lionel lover because I model with HO Scale trains and accessories. I used to be interested in Lionel though when I got my first Lionel set in December, 2001 as a birthday present. Then later on, I bought a Pipe Car which is a flatcar and I asked my cousin for a Milk Car on Christmas, it was the same thing only it was a Cola Car. But it did exactly what the Milk Car did, throwing cans out onto the platform. But later on in July, 2002, I started to go onto HO but I still like Lionel though and this video is for any Lionel lover out there. And it will bring back your childhood memories as well. Especially if you were a Lionel fan then.",1136332800,18,1419,4.182481751824818
7956925,5,B00005YDDN,"The best DVD ever created about trains in general, and Lionel Trains in particular. Former television host of NBC's ""Tomorrow Show"", Tom Syder, makes the history of Lionel trains come alive with his characteristic down-to-earth, personal warmth and engaging style. Although Tom entered eternity in 2007, the legacy this recording will be treasured by true train devotees for many years to come, including this one.  I gave this DVD 5 stars, only because 6  stars are not an option.",1500681600,,481,5.075949367088608
