5777631,5,B00D8N92B4,"This film with Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrar is a gem.  I know that it was made for and aired on TV, but it was a unique way of the retelling of the tragedy at Mayerling.  I will enjoy this DVD for many  years to come.",1400630400,2,218,3.6956521739130435
5777632,4,B00D8N92B4,Thought this early TV production very good; the performances by Hepburn and Ferrer were excellent as were the performances by the entire cast.,1396137600,,142,5.217391304347826
5777633,3,B00D8N92B4,"It was not a film but a stage play that was filmed. I expected a full length movie staring one of my favorite stars, Audrey Hepburn.",1395100800,,132,4.115384615384615
5777634,5,B00D8N92B4,"I was too young to appreciate who Audrey Hepburn was when this program originally aired.  But I can still remember the theater and the weather outside while I was sitting mesmerized inside watching ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" in its initial release.  I don't care any more where I was the day JFK bit the dust, but the day Audrey Hepburn died, far too young, immediately put me in mind of her last performance on film as Hap, the angel, in ""Always.""  Type-casting had never been so 110% perfect before, or since.",1393718400,,509,4.633333333333334
5777635,5,B00D8N92B4,"This black-and-white production was preserved, perhaps imperfectly for almost 60 years. To see a production like this from when television was in its infancy, starring Audrey Hepburn early in her career, is amazing. There are two versions on the disc, one without and one with commercials from the original airing. I watched the one without, only to watch the one with commercials, right after. They are really wonderful commercials about television sets, RCA, and how color was just coming out. It's kind of wonderful to see those antique sets with all those knobs and no remotes.
It'd be easy to fault the production (though I don't intend to) because we've come so very far since then, but there's no way to fault Audrey Hepburn.
This is a great find for any collector.",1387238400,14,772,4.856060606060606
5777636,5,B00D8N92B4,"This is a very rare work; I didn't know it was available until recently.  It was made for television in 1957 and is certainly flawed technically. I had read this was a filmed production but it looks more like a Kineoscope. It is in black and white although I had also read the production was broadcast (and shown in Europe) in color.  I also suspect that cutting the script  to 75 minutes to fit in this time slot (Producer's Showcase) is somewhat to blame for at least some of the script problems.  It tends to be disjointed and time to develop from low emotion to high emotion is not available.  Most of the supporting cast are excellent but given little time to develop their characters. Raymond Massey and Diana Wynyard come of best but with too little screen time.  Look fast for an uncredited  Suzy Parker in the second party scene.  Ferrer has to go from sensible to hysterical, to possibly slightly insane without much script time for the changes.  Hard work!  Hepburn has to move from an innocent to a girl willing to enter into a suicide pact too quickly to be totally believable, but again, this is a very rare work so being able to view it, flaws and all,  is a treat for Hepburn fans.",1383696000,5,1197,4.444954128440367
5777637,5,B00D8N92B4,"Il like the picture and Audrey Hepburn who is a vedry great star. The picture is good, and the two actors very good. I am happy that this DVD has been edited",1382572800,,157,3.9375
5777638,5,B00D8N92B4,"A ""new"" movie from Audrey Hepburn is rather rare ! (Understatement !) First time on video, since... 1956. It's very pleasant to see Audrey once more. In this TV play, Mel Ferrer is also very good.",1377648000,,196,4.472222222222222
5777639,4,B00D8N92B4,"Although the picture quality is grainy and it's in black-and-white, this TV film is worth getting for two reasons. The first and most obvious is Audrey Hepburn's ravishing portrayal of Mary Vetsera. This production was made the same year she did Funny Face and Love in the Afternoon, so it is prime Audrey at her most exquisite. I also was pleased by Mel Ferrer's performance as Prince Rudolph, which to me seems less like overacting than trying to capture the tortured quality of a disturbed young man. Audrey and Mel had just married prior to the filming of this, and their personal chemistry comes through vividly. The second reason to see this is that it is a scene-by-scene remake of Anatole Litvak's 1936 film of the same name, a highly regarded French production starring Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux. (That film is generally considered by critics to be superior to Terrence Young's 1968 film of the same story with Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve, although I must confess I prefer the latter, which also borrows from Litvak's original, although not to anywhere near the same degree.) Although this 1957 version is credited as having been directed by Kirk Browning, it was produced by Litvak, and his influence must have been enormous. If you watch the 1957 and 1936 versions back-to-back, you become aware of how identical they are: the English dialogue of 1957 is virtually the same as the subtitles in the 1936 French version, and even the transition images--such as the large ringing bell superimposed over a postcard shot of St. Stephan's Cathedral to mark the prince's wedding--are the same. Another example is that when the prince attends a ballet performance at the court theater, it is the same ballet--Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker (even though that ballet did not actually premiere until three years after Rudolph's death). The 1936 version is available on a high-quality DVD release from Janus Films, but having it in English is a great advantage to the TV version; for some reason, I find it disconcerting to hear Austrians speaking in French. The disc allows you to watch just the film, or to include the original 1957 commercials. It's amusing that one of the original commercials was for RCA color TVs, in which they asked, ""Wouldn't you rather be seeing this in color?"" to which the obvious answer is, ""Yes!"" Perhaps it was broadcast in color in 1957 but all we have left is a black-and-white kinescope; the package does not specify. Videotape had been invented in 1956, but the third-generation quality of the picture leads me to suspect it was not used for this production. I knocked one star off my rating purely for the inferior picture quality, but it is still quite watchable. The TV film should be in the collections of anyone who is a fan of Miss Hepburn as well as those who are intrigued by the actual story of the Crown Prince's tragic life.",1376611200,22,2884,4.851926977687627
5777640,4,B00D8N92B4,"I was pleasantly surprised by Mayerling.  Having only seen pictures and a grainy clip of the film I wasn't sure what to expect.  Thankfully, the film was thoroughly entertaining and Audrey Hepburn was captivating.  Despite Mel Ferrer's starched performance, Audrey's showmanship set the tone of the film and was accompanied by a strong cast and immaculate sets.  The costumes elevated the performances and Audrey fans will not be disappointed by her wardrobe.  The ball gown she wore during the royal ball was lovely especially matched by the flowers sewn into her hair.  It's a treat for fans everywhere to be able to add this movie to their collection of classic films.",1372636800,8,671,5.0
5777641,4,B00D8N92B4,"Made on the heels of Audrey's marriage to Mel Ferrer, this would've seemed a perfect match-up. It almost was--Audrey was perfect for Marie (played her like a more sober version of Natasha from ""War & Peace"" which the two of them had just completed), Basil Sydney made an august Franz Joseph and the supporting cast headed by Raymond Massey is distinguished and xlnt. The flat spot is Mel Ferrer, who just can't hit the romantic notes necessary to make the story believable, especially at the end when he commits suicide on her then himself. Interestingly, it isn't hard to see that Audrey is married to Mel, but it's very hard to see that Mel is married to Audrey. The actual incident is still controversial, but by any measure is seen as the starting shot for WWI. The picture is okay, pretty good for a kinescope.",1472774400,2,815,4.627586206896551

Catherine Deneuve is a very handsome actress, but she misses the warmth and spontaneity which I loved to see in Audrey Hepburn. It helps ,of course, if you are playing this next to your husband and it shows. This movie is much better and I have sent it to friends who will love it!

5777655,4,B00D8N92B4,"I gave it four stars because I adore Audrey but here're a few of the negatives about this miniseries.

Image was too blurry
Deficient sound, although I could understand most of what was being said.

The above have to do with this being a rare, old production, which is to a somewhat understandable due to the aged of this material.

The production itself seems to be a low budget one, which is surprising, given that it was made when Audrey was close to her fame's peak.

I am sorry but I never really liked Mel Ferrer. He didn't seem all that bad in this one, but then again, it was a little blurry.

As always, Audrey's charm and natural acting skills saved the day",1456531200,,667,4.346774193548387
5777656,5,B00D8N92B4,"Lovely vintage gem that pairs the recently married 'star couple' of the day, Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer in a historical drama based on a true story.

The production and acting are stilted, the film quality is poor, the acting is mediocre.  However, it should be seen.  These are both good actors, and given Audrey Hepburn's fame, is a rare little movie one has the privilege of seeing for free on Prime.  There is good chemistry between the main characters.  There is also a sense of larger than life characters on a theatrical stage.  The black and white film creates more drama.  The story is simple and poignant.  However, in typical Hollywood fashion, there is little emphasis on researching the real facts behind this mystery, and more emphasis on the dramatic climax.

The real story behind the Archduke's motives are to be found in Wikipedia.  No spoilers here!

This is a very young Audrey and Mel, and I enjoyed watching them as much as the story line.  They make a handsome couple.  Don't judge this movie harshly.  It is a delicate old film, and has a place in history, and should be seen.  I refuse to compare it to any other movie, especially the original with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux, or the subsequent one with Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve.  This is just another version of that old tragic story, and just as good.",1454198400,,1349,4.676595744680851

5777675,4,B00D8N92B4,"This was a television movie, broadcast in 1957 as part of the Producers Showcase series.  It is an adaptation of the events involving the final, unhappy days of Crown Prince Rudolph of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.

The basic facts are well known, so I don't think there are any spoilers here.  Rudolph was the only son of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elizabeth (Sisi/Sissi).  He was a sensitive and unhappy child, and his father was very disappointed in him.  Rudolph was married, unhappily, of course, to Princess Stephanie of Belgium, whom he essentially ignored.  He engaged in various affairs, with his final affair being with a teenage girl, the Baroness Marie (Mary) Vetsera.  The ending, of course, is a fictional portrayal, as precisely what happened at Mayerling behind closed doors (and why) is disputed and argued to this day.

Here, Rudolph is portrayed by a very handsome and compelling Mel Ferrer, and Mary is portrayed by a luminous Audrey Hepburn.  The two were married at the time.  They are the main reasons for wanting to see this version of the story.

Two other film versions are more well-known.  There was a 1936 version with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux, and a 1968 version with Omar Shariff and Catherine Deneuve.",1435968000,,1253,4.971153846153846

5777684,3,B00D8N92B4,"For years, Audrey Hepburn fans have wanted to the 1957 television production of Mayerling with Audrey playing Baroness Maria Vetsera and her then husband Mel Ferrer playing Crown Prince Rudolph, It seems a natural: a famous romantic tragedy with the sort of lavish costumes we'd just seen in War & Peace. Now it's finally available and Audrey fans can add it to their collection. But be forewarned: this is not ""Romeo and Juliet"". It certainly isn't ""Love in the Afternoon"", either. This is a rather sordid story with the mentally unbalanced Prince talking a 17 year old mistress and then murdering her and himself.

Audrey is introduced with the Prince saying that there is no innocence left in the world. He meets her and his aide asks him if he still thinks that. But Maria is no innocent. She is invited to his lodgings and clearly knows what the purpose of her visit is. She's not dismayed in the least when invited to his bedroom and says ""I don't know if I can please you: I'm just a wisp"". No- there's no real sex. In fact, in a badly written scene, He impulsively orders her to leave, thinking she's after something, like everybody else is. But all she's after is him.. Later she attends a ball hosted by the Prince and his wife and boldly dances with him. His wife stares icily at her and we are made to realize that sweet, innocent Audrey is breaking up a marriage.

Later, for the only time in her career, Audrey's character dies, (she's already dead when she plays the Angel in ""Always""). In fact, she gets shot to death. it's done about as tastefully as it could be: We see the servant cleaning up around the fireplace and he hears a shot. Then we see Audrey looking as if she's asleep except there's a small trickle of blood on her forehead, (it must have been a tiny little bullet). But still, if you were expecting a frothy romance, you're going to be surprised.

The production values are strong, (although it was originally in color, which is lost on this kinoscope). The performances are strong. it's directed by Anatole Litvak, who directed the 1936 movie version, generally considered the best, (this is a boiled down version of that film). It's always fun to see the many recognizable actors who went on to TV fame, including Raymond Massey, Lorne Greene, Nehemiah Persoff, David Opatoushu, Pippa Scott and Nancy Marchand as Ferrer's wife. She's better known as Marty's girl in the 1953 teleplay, Lou Grant's Mrs. Pynchon and Tony Soprano's Mom.

Ironically, the latest evidence is that Maria was not shot at all. The prevailing theory is that she died from a botched abortion and that the guilt-ridden, despondent prince then offed himself. But you never have seen that on television in 1957.",1429747200,,2716,4.675732217573222

This is by far not her best work, but I enjoyed Mayerling as part of Ms. Hepburn's history. Not for everyone.",1421884800,,286,4.627450980392157

5777700,3,B00D8N92B4,We are lucky to have a record of this performance at all. The original telecast was in color but the kinescope that this comes from is black & white. The picture quality is okay considering but the production itself is lackluster. Audrey Hepburn comes off well but the script and direction provide limited emotion for what should have been a deeply felt love story. It's interesting to see this but the high price of the DVD-R disc and the resulting production make it worth-while only for those very interested in having a complete record of Audrey Hepburn's career.,1414022400,2,567,4.795918367346939
8590639,3,B00D8N92B4,"Anatole Litvak had previously directed the French film version of Mayerling (1936), starring Danielle Darrieux as Mary and Charles Boyer as Rudolf.  His American production of Mayerling was originally filmed in color at great expense to NBC.  The program cost more than 500,000 dollars and was shown only one time.  It aired February 4, 1957 and starred Audrey Hepburn and her then husband Mel Ferrer.  One of the remarkable things about this American production is that it is almost a scene by scene, word by word adaptation of Litvak's more successful 1936 movie version.

Although it was aired in color, it was unfortunately preserved in black and white kinescope. Perhaps it could be colorized someday.  The kinescope cost was a mere fraction of the half million dollars NBC spent on the lavish production. The Networks during that period did not really see the resale value in programs like this or the historical importance.  Most kinescope were of such poor quality that they were thought to be unusable for broadcast purposes.  However with the advancement in digital technology they can be greatly improved which is exactly the case with this remarkable presentation at Amazon.

The story is a highly romanticized version of the events that happen on January 30, 1889, based on
based on Claude Anet's 1930 novel Idyll's End .

These events had far reaching consequences that were only revealed later in history.  With the death of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, the heir apparent to the throne of Austria-Hungary from birth, and the death of Archduke Karl Ludwig in 1896 from typhoid, the throne fell to  Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the new heir presumptive. Again historical events ended with the assassination of the Archduke at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, and World War One would see the total collapse of the oldest European Dynasty to rule over a nation.

Hepburn and Ferrer try their best to present the events of love affair between Rudolph and Baroness Mary Vetsera.  And as it goes it was smashingly good tv for the time.  However in comparison to the other Mayerling with Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux they are lacking.  There is something about the film that makes it superior to the limits of the tv versions.  People who have not seen the French film will not notice. People who have will.",1518652800,,2316,4.927835051546392
8590640,5,B00D8N92B4,"Excellent performances.  Audrey Hepburn is perfect as the wide-eyed innocent Maria. (How sad that she believed she could never have another lover in her life!  I blame Rudolf.-- He had plenty of lovers.)  Would have liked to see a follow-up scene where Rudolf's mother Princess Elizabeth (""Sissi') learns about his death.",1502496000,,321,5.254901960784314

8590642,2,B00D8N92B4,"While the production was a good one, the video quality is horrible.  I like old movies, but this was a television production from the 50s, and the transfer to DVD, however that was done, was of poor quality.  Perhaps the source itself was of poor quality.  If you demand clarity of picture in order to enjoy a production, you will not enjoy this despite the excellent actors.  In fact, in the hundreds of DVDs I have purchase and viewed, this is without a doubt the worst for video quality.  Had I known this, I would not have purchased it.",1495324800,,540,4.414141414141414
