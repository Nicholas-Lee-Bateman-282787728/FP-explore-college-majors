6853656,3,B00Q3BRN7I,My toddler loves the show when it decides to play. My husband even tried buying it on instant to see if it would work better then just watching it on Prime. We really wanted to buy the DVD since our toddler is obsessed but it's only 6 episodes. We would be willing to pay $20 for the first season. I'm really not sure why they have chosen to do it like this.,1441065600,3,358,3.986111111111111
6853657,3,B00Q3BRN7I,This dvd is only the first 6 episodes which is why its so cheap. I wish they would make one that is the entire season. also they could put a little more time into this.,1439251200,,168,3.8285714285714287

We stream the episodes mainly for our 2.5 year old, but his 8 and 10-year old siblings will sit down and watch an entire episode with him.

8690137,4,B00Q3BRN7I,My son absolutely loves this show! We were glad to have it on DVD because we're not always in a position to stream the show on our devices. This way he can always watch it or take the DVD with them to Grandma and Grandpa's house. Amazon is seriously missing out on an opportunity for more merchandise we want Tumble Leaf toys!
