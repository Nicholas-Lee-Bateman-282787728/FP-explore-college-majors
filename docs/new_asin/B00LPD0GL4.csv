6498194,5,B00LPD0GL4,This was a really cute movie!! There were some parts that could have been better but over all a good one!,1417910400,4,105,4.0476190476190474
6498195,4,B00LPD0GL4,"Worldly meets down-homey, as a  rock star finds true meaning, in this pleasant, made for TV Christmas romantic, dramedy, previously titled Jingle Bell Rock.

It's that time of the year again.  Time to boost the Christmas spirit with romance and finding one's true, joyful self in a holiday movie.  I enjoy Christmas movies, and this one features Drew Lachey as a city, hard livin', drinkin', rock star who hasn't written a song in 4 years who agrees to stay with a loving, small town family as a promotion to kick his career and image up.

The family's daughter, played by Canadian actor and classical violinist, Mackenzie Porter is immediately at odds with the rocker. He's at odds with their family closeness, prayer and church doings and general clean living.  It's a set-up for some romantic bantering, budding romance, life changing and a cute duet.

Nominated for 2 awards via the Directors' Guild of Canada(does Hollywood make movies in Hollywood anymore?) for TV movie, it shows some drinking and the consequences, and a touch of innuendo, but overall, a family friendly movie with a good message. No real special features included.",1415750400,21,1140,4.968421052631579

6498197,4,B00LPD0GL4,"I'm so glad this is being made available on DVD this year. I love Christmas movies, even cheesy ones, but too often the Christian faith (not just angels or ""good deeds"") is hard to find. I'm a Christian but even I don't like preachy movies. This one represents a family of faith who is represented as a normal family and not a goofy stereotype that Hollywood likes to give us. My copy is already preordered!",1415318400,33,407,4.44

6498225,3,B00LPD0GL4,"Very, very sweet story that was lighter on the 'star' aspect than I would have really liked. The story is really not about Dax being a star, it's about Dax the star remembering he's a regular person. The story itself was definitely on the syrupy side -- perfect for Hallmark. A minister's daughter moved back home after losing her job, a contest, a crush, a win, and a celebrity remembers what he was before he became so jaded.

I really felt like the story was trying to do so much, and that it didn't really accomplish it all. I did have some plot questions as the story played out. For instance, there was a story about the local club closing without money, and the concert was to raise money, but that sort of fell to the side. The whole 'crush' aspect wasn't really dealt with beyond being mentioned a couple of times, though there was subtext about how Kelly had grown out of that and saw him as a human. The entire contest was, I'd thought, to fulfill a child's wish, but Kelly was 26, and that was never something that was addressed. (Or maybe I missed something in the story...)

There were some ""darker"" elements -- curfew busting, Dax's drinking, him 'dating' Kelly while having a girlfriend -- that seemed to push the boundaries of what was essentially a very wholesome story. They were handled with care and respect however, as were the relationships between the Harding kids and their parents, their family traditions, and even Dax's previous not-so-great choices. There were a lot of great elements to the story, and I think that it's at least worth a watch if the blurb interests you.

That all said, I really, really would have liked to have had more 'star' aspect to the tale, but that really wasn't what the movie was about. It wasn't clear about that going in, so I do want to mention it. It was a good story, and I liked what it was with my few plot quibbles, but it wasn't really the story I was hoping to find, even though I did enjoy watching it.",1451692800,2,1970,4.4515235457063715

6498251,5,B00LPD0GL4,"Even though the plot was predictable, it was still fun to see the situation unfold, and I appreciate that the film maker kept the story fairly clean for the most part. Also, the moral of the story was outstanding! Unlike some other Christmas ""chic-flicks,"" the acting was much better than average, and I thought the actors were well cast. My only negative comment is that the movie could've been even better with more background music throughout the movie. (Often, there was only silence besides the dialogue.) FWiW, I have two teenage boys who didn't seem to like it that much, but my adopted young-teen nieces loved it!",1424995200,,621,4.813084112149533

6498293,5,B00LPD0GL4,"Loved it, I'm really into cheesy romance so if that's what your into then you'll defiantly enjoy this very simple romantic movie.

The only thing I have to complain about is the kiss the guy gave to the girl in the church, you can tell they chose not to do it on the big screen. The only kiss in this movie was at the end of the movie, which was worth it but I would of loved to see more romance of these two actors.",1419724800,,416,3.8941176470588235

6498307,5,B00LPD0GL4,"Awesome movie! It shows God's way... Giving of Himself to us, regardless of our state of pain and brokenness. He died for us while we were still sinners. He never gives up on us. I saw the message behind the movie and I pray God inspires more actors and writers to create movies like this in the near future. With that said, depending on your convictions, I don't see this being a ""family movie"" because of the depiction of getting intoxicated. I like the way the movie does not glorify it but uses it to lay a foundation for Dax's need of Jesus in his life. I am just saying I do not recommend children under the age of 16 or so watch this movie unless you have a very mature and secure child under that age.",1419292800,6,709,4.182481751824818

6498310,4,B00LPD0GL4,"I thought it was a fun movie with a little bit different twist than most Christmas movies. However, I must disagree with some of the reviews. I am a Christian and I thought in the beginning the minister was rather rude to the guest. Also I thought in the beginning he was very pushy like telling him to sing at church rather than asking him for example. The mother should have had a stronger part. She was likable but pretty plain vanilla. I do think that half way through they started setting the example and allowing the star to find his way. Good ending and left you feeling good. However, wouldn't it be a better ending if the song was less romantic (especially for church) and more about turning your life around or not giving up, etc.?

All and all its enjoyable and 'll probably watch it again next year!",1419033600,9,811,4.406666666666666

6498312,5,B00LPD0GL4,"Lets face it the movies I enjoy and you enjoy may be vastly different but this one was a wonderful surprise for me. A jaded rock star that has somewhat lost his soul does a benefit only for the PR shot in the arm that might save his struggling career. He hates the idea but reluctantly goes along. She is a small town girl in love with his image from her teen years but when she meets the real him she is so disillusioned she is ready to give up but she doesnt. It is a sweet story of love, family, and the magic of the holiday season. If you have bothered to read this far then I wouldnt miss it. Buy it now you won't regret it.",1418083200,4,629,3.921875
6498313,4,B00LPD0GL4,"The wholesome Up cable network got a wee bit edgier when it aired GUESS WHO'S COMING TO CHRISTMAS in 2013. The plot isn't the freshest; in fact, the Hallmark Movie Channel had shown the similarly-themed STRAWBERRY SUMMER the year before.

When New York paparazzi snap unflattering photos of self-indulgent rock star Dax (no last name) asleep at the wheel with a frozen holiday turkey on his passenger seat, he seeks to salvage his tarnished image by fulfilling a fan's Christmas wish. Cognizant that sales of his albums have been steady slipping, off he goes, reluctantly, from bustling New York City to snowy Cedar Grove, Illinois, home to 26-year-old Kelly Harding (MacKenzie Porter), unwitting winner of the fan contest. Kelly is at a low point in her career, an unemployed jacket book writer for children's books forced to move back in with her parents six months back. It was many years ago when she was a teen that she crushed on Dax, never mind that huge poster of him still prominent on her bedroom wall.

With the local hotels showing no vacancies, the Hardings open up their home to the sulking rock star for his one week stay. This is when we really suss out what would be a recurring subplot: the clash of lifestyles brought on by Dax's rock & roll excessess and the Harding family's simple midwestern ways. Imagine Dax's chagrin when Mr. Harding (Peter Lacroix), who happens to be a minister, informs him of his 11:30 curfew. Dax's startled response: ""A.m. or p.m?""

Although it takes a bit to get there, this really is an uplifting feel-good yuletide movie with a fair share of laughs. There's a positive message about faith and a rediscovering of roots. Drew Lachey, who plays the 32-year-old rock star, is immediately likable. We get a sense that even though Dax is self-absorbed, he's not intentionally a jerk about it in terms of hurting other folks. He just seems lost. As his week in the Heartland progresses and as he's embraced, flaws and all, by a loving family, he opens up to the Hardings, and especially to Kelly. And when he confides to her that it's been four years since he's written a song, well, you can guess what happens next. In fact, you can map out the route of this story. Obstacles surface, and they're predictable. Like, will a scheduling conflict prevent Dax from performing at the local Christmas pageant? Will the unexpected arrival of Dax's high-maintenance girlfriend (Olivia Cheng) ruin Dax and Kelly's developing romance? Will Dax and the minister arrive at a dtente? Odds are, you can answer those questions pretty easily. And so what? With these sorts of movies, it's all about the journey, the fun of getting there. Also, there are llamas in the backyard, and a Ferwumble, and at the end a musical duet entitled ""You"" by Lachey and Porter (who in real life also sings country music).",1418083200,10,2832,4.775510204081633
