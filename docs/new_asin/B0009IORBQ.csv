8061299,5,B0009IORBQ,"The case photos and blurb of plot synopsis seem to indicate that this film is going to be a sad downer. The doctor tells computer language expert Jacques Dutronc that his brain is rapidly perishing. Then Jacques meets beautiful Sophie Marceau, in the clutches of a group of oddballs who use her in a club act where she is hypnotized and then addresses very intimate insights to various club patrons. As Jacques and Sophie fall in love, she realizes he is deteriorating. And brief flashbacks reveal their traumatic childhoods. (That's enough plot to engage you, I hope.)

Yet the movie is a comedy! Jacques with his off the track verbiage, his antic behavior. Sophie contending with him and her hangers-on. The ""Stephen King"" hotel clerk and bellhop.

And the images on screen are so brilliant! Wonderful colorful cinematography, with ingenious Zulawski capturing just what he wants, hang the expense. Though used sparingly, the music is beautifully emotional. And Sophie's high fashion dresses are as outrageous as Brazilian parrots.

Oh, she's so pretty. And Dutronc, slight of frame, long faced, rather worn with age, eyes bluer than ever, obviously feels his role fits him to a T.

This movie just has to flow over you. Let it! Twenty-four hours later, I am still elated.

FOOTNOTE:  This film is based on a prize-winning novel (not available in English) from the mid 80's by the then trendy author Raphaelle Billetdoux. After her father's death, she dropped out for 10 years, then re-emerged in the niche of homeopathy premised on the poisonous serpent in each of us that prompts bad behavior and real illness. I bet Zulawski is intrigued.",1257033600,8,1643,4.956363636363636
8061300,2,B0009IORBQ,"Contrary to the jacket shown here, its write-up and the Amazon description, this is only in French (including the jacket -- Mes Nuits sont plus belles que vos Jours).  It's supposed to have English subtitles, but I haven't found them yet.  It looks like it's a good film, and I really like Sophie Marceau, but it's really misleading, although the Product Description does say it's in French with English subtitles.  I've been studying French for a couple of years so I'll keep it, but if you only understand English, forget it.",1256947200,,527,4.769230769230769
8061301,2,B0009IORBQ,"Movie is in French with English subtitles and is about a man dying of a brain disease and a young married woman who loves him.  As his disease progresses his words make no sense -- but this whole movie makes no sense.  I loved Sophie Marceau in Firefly and thought this would be another wonderful love story, but it's very hard to follow with flashbacks from both of their pasts which torment them still.  Rent it instead because you won't want to watch it again.",1243296000,3,463,4.423529411764706
