8735635,4,B01648P9HA,"This is a Super Why DVD that features four Super Why episodes. Each episode covers a fairy tale which is cute in itself! I admit I love how Super Why teaches kids in a fun way. From lessons on being a good friend and team work to words, there really is a lot going on in the show. My daughter loves the stories and how the characters create words. The Super Readers use Word Power, Spelling Power and Alphabet Power to teach new words. The total of the episodes is 120 minutes.

I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1454716800,,555,4.285714285714286
