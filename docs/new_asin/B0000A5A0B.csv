If your idea of a good time is having your mentaly challenged friend jump in front of the TV set just when the good stuff is coming up on the Playboy channel then by all means purchase this dissapointing peice of erotic candy floss. This psuedo documentary of college girls baring it all for the camera could have been a nice piece of nothing but the producers have opted for a feature, supposedly for your conveiniance that ruins everyting. There are 2 versions of the same film on this one disc. One of them is in shutter 3D(Imax,Ultimate horror set ect.) and the other is flat. In order to seamlessly switch from the rather nice 3D to 2D you can use the angle setting on your remote. Unfortunately this means that a movie camera logo remains almost center screen two inches from the top throughout the entire show and there is no way to get rid of it! Sometimes it's right over ther girls face and over times it censors the naughty bits. It's so annoying it makes you want to throw things at the screen rather than the other way around as in most 3d projects. The girls are nice,some can barely read the cue cards and the 3D is very good without being too gimmicky but even at a low ticket price the botched logo thing makes this thing a loser. Razor 3D has done this type of thing before but usually the camera superimposure is way in the top right hand corner. This time it's the elephant in the living room.
