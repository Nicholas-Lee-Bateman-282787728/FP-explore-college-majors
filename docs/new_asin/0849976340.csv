7793167,5,0849976340,"I absolutely loved the ""Little dogs on the Prairie"" videos. I had them a long time ago, but gave them away to my nieces and nephews. I have wanted to buy them again but haven't seen them on any store shelves since. I like the way they weave old clich&eacute;s into the dialogue. I would be laughing hysterically, but the kids didn't get it. That's ok, there was plenty of silly stuff for the kids, too. All to drive home an important life lesson.",1403654400,,446,4.321428571428571
7793168,5,0849976340,This is a favorite family show with good lessons. I would recommend watching when you can. The video ran well and came in time for my grandson to see it while they were visiting.,1360454400,,178,4.264705882352941
7793169,5,0849976340,"These characters are super funny. My husband even enjoyed watching this, and he rarely wastes his precious time watching kids videos, or any videos for that matter.  We all wish there were more of this series.",1344816000,2,209,4.805555555555555

7793171,5,0849976340,"My 6 year old absolutely loves this tape. The stories are humorous but have a point. There are comparisons to Veggietales, of course, but then again, that puts this tape series in some pretty good company, doesn't it?

What's best, at least for this parent, is that the dialogue is quick, snappy, and has stuff for the grown-ups so that you don't go nuts listening to it over and over again. In other wordsw, it's not at all like Barney!",1150416000,3,437,4.4625
