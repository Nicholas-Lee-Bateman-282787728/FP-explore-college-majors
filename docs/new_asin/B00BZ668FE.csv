5683020,5,B00BZ668FE,"Have seen all series of this gripping drama that is confronting and in your face, wonderful acting and non PC. Not for the faint hearted.",1393459200,,137,4.52
5683021,5,B00BZ668FE,"It is some weeks since I watched Season 4, and the first thing to flag is that there are NO SPOILERS in this review.

An indication of how much I have enjoyed this series is when the lead character appeared in S2Ep1 with a different hair cut, I was somewhat annoyed - it seemed to me they decided to play around a bit with her image and made a mistake as her original hair design, as followed in S3 and S4, returns (a no-nonsense ponytail that matches her character).

In other words, there is not much to criticise here, in my view. The characters we have come to know develop more with some being tested to the limits of their beliefs and tenacity - the changes in some of them are very believable. The pressures placed on Police to deliver instant results are wrenching.

The impact on them after being attacked themselves is very well portrayed.

When I started watching S1, after a constant diet of mostly American shows, I initially thought Spiral was all a bit too cute and very 'French', without being stereotypical - not trying to be, anyway.

But it quickly developed into a very gritty and sometimes highly confronting experience that only the Danish series like The Killing (The Crime) has bettered.

The Europeans remain steadfastly interested in the human drama side of things, with violence being used by the Police, in most instances, as an absolutely last resort,

Rather than being addicted to veritable orgies of violence, torture and death as if that on its own makes a great series, with 'the gun' being the answer for just about anything, and retribution of biblical proportions usually associated. Don't get me wrong - I love many American (U.S.) shows - but the cultural shift to France is significant and quite jolting.

Dare I say it the characters in shows like Spiral are significantly more developed and thus nuanced, overall very sophisticated. My favourite character throughout Spiral, apart from the female lead, is the investigative judge who is a bit of a maverick, with a constant mischievous twinkle in his eye - beautifully played by the seasoned actor concerned.

Spiral was a big hit in France, and I can understand why. Thoroughly recommended.

Having said that, those looking for something much tougher and blacker should take a look at another French crime series titled 'Braquo' - it makes Spiral look a little like a French period piece by comparison.",1386201600,3,2395,4.79126213592233
5683022,5,B00BZ668FE,"Season 4 continues with this series' superb, suspenseful and topical storytelling.  Will Laure transcend her new boss's enmity towards her, will Juge Roban secure victory over those seeking his downfall, does Josephine continue her amoral behavior and  where does PIerre's alliance with a notorious gangstar lead?These, and other conflicts, personal and professional, form the backdrop for the main plot which pits Laure and her team against the anti-terrorism force in racing to outwit a home-grown terrorist plot. It will keep you riveted from the first episode on.  I wasn't sure Netflix would have Season 4, so I purchased the DVDs, even going so far to buy a DVD player that plays region 2 disks.  That's how hooked I am on this series!",1382486400,2,741,5.049180327868853
5683023,5,B00BZ668FE,"Excellent.  One of the best series out right now.  Actually, I'd say it's a tie between ""The Bridge"" (the original Danish/Swedish version) and ""Spiral.""

Fourth Season of ""Spiral"" moved a little slower, featured a bit more of the Parisian landscape than 2 & 3 which were claustrophobic, visually, as well as in the relationship-realm of the cops. This was really fine work.  Fourth season looked and felt a little more like a typical BBC-style cop or mystery/MI5 show--slow to get going, a lot of wide shots, showing the scenery etc.  Made me wonder whether or not this was a stylistic change necessitated by the BBC throwing money into ""Spiral"" and making it a joint production of BBC and the French.

Still, ""Spiral"" Season 4 is riveting, with excellent acting, scripting, dialogue.  MORE! I want more ""Spiral""!!!",1375056000,7,815,4.948529411764706
5683024,5,B00BZ668FE,"By the fourth season most series have start to run out of steam, Spiral 4 continues to the same high standard as before. If you have not watched any of the previous three season do so, Spiral is better than any current US or UK cop series.",1374624000,5,239,4.1063829787234045
5683025,5,B00BZ668FE,Engrenages (Spiral) dramatises a world that many of us would never dream existed but is a reality for those whom the underworld is something to be faced on a daily basis. Enthralling and intriguing! Definitely watch this series - not for the squeamish.,1372723200,,252,4.883720930232558
5683026,5,B00BZ668FE,Fabulous series.,1466726400,,16,7.5
5683027,5,B00BZ668FE,"Spellbinding police/law drama fom France!  Superb acting, fantastic writing, nail-biting, complex plots that deal with socially relevant issues.  Kudos to production team for the action scenes all around Paris, the great close-up shots of the characters to heighten suspense or conflict, and for the often chaotic, intense interior scenes, which look like they must have been difficult to coordinate and shoot.

If there is a Season 5 available somewhere, _would someone please leave a comment here?  No spoilers, so I can't say why I wish for another season. However, for those new to this show, don't worry:  Season 4 DOES offer a conclusion of sorts to the show while leaving plenty of room for more!

I stumbled upon Spiral"" while searching for another foreign police/mystery show, since I've been impressed by the depth of plot and characters in many of them  I became immediately hooked on Spral, and watched the entire 4 seasons in 2 days, Glad I had the time because every episode moves forward complex over- arching story-lines, and each season blends seamlessly into the next. As another reviewer remarked, it's hard to believe the show  began in 2005 and season four is from 2012!  In each season we learn more and more about the backgrounds of the main characters and  what drives them. They are portrayed as fully human, with personal and professional capabilities and foibles - all of which add depth to the plots.

I found the French justice system as portrayed here fascinating. How the police, lawyers,and judges interact so closely has been mentioned by another reviewer, so I won't go into it except to say Spiral would be worth watching just to see this!

Finally, I highly suggest watching Spiral  from beginning -- the one-liner episode ""synopses""  given by Amazon don't BEGIN to cover the content of each episode, and it could be confusing to jump in anywhere.  Also, I would not recommend this to anyone who wants quickly wrapped-up solutions, cardboard characters, or gratuitous violence.  Finally, I should mention that, like many foreign productions, Spiral has some sexual content -- which is easily skipped w/a bit of fast- forwarding I suppose-- but these short scenes, just like the few where shooting does occur, are integral to the plot and to understanding the characters through myriad, unexpected twists and turns

Overall, I found Spiral to be a bold, gritty, intelligent police/law drama. I would give it more stars if it were possible.  :)",1465603200,,2478,5.017114914425428
5683028,5,B00BZ668FE,I have to pace myself on this series as it's really tempting to binge watch since it's so good.  I have viewed all 5 seasons and would recommend ALL five of them hands down.  I'm not sure one is better than the other because the writing and acting is so good.  I'm sure the sub-titles would bother some but they don't bother me.,1460332800,,328,4.174603174603175

5683030,5,B00BZ668FE,"Hands down the best gritty cop show on tv. I started with Season 4 on Netflix and then bought Seasons 1-3 and 5 from Amazon. Shortly after Netflix added Seasons 1-3.  Hoping there is a Season 6 soon. If you buy the dvds be careful, the dvds come from the UK and use Region 2 format. This will not play on most dvd players in the US. You must have an All Region player like the Sony DVPSR37. If Caroline Proust were on American tv she would have already won at least 2 Emmys. In French with subtitles, which takes a bit getting used to, but well worth the inconvenience. Warning. Not for kids or squeemish adults.",1447977600,,612,4.230769230769231

5683037,5,B00BZ668FE,"Spiral is a French version of Law and Order, but without the tidy endings; it makes its American competitors look like greasy kids stuff.  Great acting, direction, writing.",1421280000,,172,5.142857142857143

8575749,3,B00BZ668FE,"This starts as a good series although it gets a bit soap opera-ish after season 2.  Caroline Proust is a major over-actor but I can tolerate her because the rest of the cast is very good.  Thierry Godard delivers his usual A+ performance. Someone needs to give Laure Berthaud a hair brush and show her how to use it - looking at that messy hair constantly is off putting as are her sexual hookups.  It is hard to respect her as a police captain when she cannot control her own life and constantly makes self-harmful choices. One poster said this wasa better than The Wire - I strenuously disagree.  The entire The Wire series was excellent, with the story actually getting better each season, and it never turned into a soap opera.  Its strength was character development and constant change which happens in real life.  None of these characters in Spiral have friends or lives outside of their work other than TinTin.",1511740800,,918,4.635802469135802
8575750,5,B00BZ668FE,This show is amazing and so suspenseful!!! Good pacing and cliffhangers...I just want it to keep going!,1510531200,,103,5.117647058823529
8575751,5,B00BZ668FE,"Spiral is a French police procedural, that goes beyond the nitty gritty. The detectives offices are bleak and dirty. Even though the series is filmed in color, it is dark so it seems to be filmed in black and white. As the series moved from the first to the 4th, we come to get to know the characters involved. The detectives all have their own stories, and learning about them all brings us closer to the group. We also meet the lawyers, the judges and the official hierarchy of these professions.

Josphine Karlsson, played by Audrey Fleurot, is a beautiful, defence lawyer, who makes serious personal and professional mistakes. The head police detective Laure Berthaud  played by Caroline Proust, is very professional on duty, always wearing a messed up hairdo. Off duty is another matter, she still has the messy hair and wears clothes right off the floor, but she is looking for Love in most of the wrong places. The other two main detectives Tintin and Gilou, have such interesting lives you need to see them.

In this series the police are dealing with an outside group causing death and destruction. . Racism and sexism come to the fore, and we observe the behind the scenes life of terrorists..
This is really a season that brings us front and center with the real world of today.

Recommended. prisrob 10-11-17",1507680000,,1320,4.726086956521739
