8079692,5,B000ASKKFW,I bought this to replace my VHS- I use it as part of my first aid section  in my college class - very good dvd for parents too,1423958400,,126,3.5
8079693,5,B000ASKKFW,"This is a wonderful introduction to playing castanets. The exercises really help to strengthen the fingers and prepare them for the more intricate patterns. Practicing these exercises every day, or as often as possible, will pay off. And added to that are some of the most basic steps so that you are learning to move and play at the same time.",1354147200,2,344,4.655737704918033
8079694,4,B000ASKKFW,"I felt that it was good but very short, I would have liked more information on the spanish dancing and castinets. Otherwise it is good.",1244678400,,135,4.44
8079695,5,B000ASKKFW,"Because authentic flamenco classes can be difficult to find (especially in smaller cities) this DVD offers a great introduction to the art form.  The inclusion of the castanet work is an added bonus, as it is rare to find classes that offer the practice.  The class is presented clearly, without frills, so that even the beginning dancer can pick up the movements.

It is also useful for intermediate and advanced dancers as a practice tool away from the class room.  I use it when I am unable to get to class, and it keeps me in shape.",1124323200,11,536,4.494845360824742
