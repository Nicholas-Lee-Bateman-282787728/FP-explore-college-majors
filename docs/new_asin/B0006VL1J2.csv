2196803,5,B0006VL1J2,"Tae Guk Gi (loosely translated as ""Old Glory"", at least for Americans) is not MASH, but rather a real blood and guts look at the Korean War.  While it is hampered by some truly mawkish sentimentality (the last 20 minutes, in particular, should have been cut from the film), it's also an undeniably world class production that brings the horrors of war to the screen as well as any other film ever has.  Forced conscription, brutality, torture, and state repression were shown as they probably really occurred, as vices employed by both sides in the conflict.  The acting is routinely excellent and the story flows very quickly thru its 140 minutes.  When I left the theater there were very few people who hadn't been at least quietly crying.  But it's not really a sad film, it's an intimate family tale told in a sweepingly epic form.

If you liked this do check out the director's earlier hit Shiri.  It's a modern day Cold War yarn, a lesser production to be sure, but quite remarkable for a summer blockbuster in both its relevance and freshness.

Finally, I must say that for a film like this to be completely ignored by the Oscars is further proof of the increasing insignificance of that whole event as an objective judge of artistic merit in film.  As Hollywood continues to churn out lower quality productions (perhaps constricted by corporate and union bureaucracies), while world film quality continues to increase, the Oscars are beginning to show themselves to be what they were originally intended as: a callous insider-controlled self-promotion vehicle.",1108339200,10,1568,4.909090909090909
2196804,4,B0006VL1J2,"Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo (aka The Brotherhood of War) is the most expensive film ever made in Korea and the biggest home hit this year. It is directed and written by Kang je-gyu whom some dub the 'Spielberg of South Korea', and indeed his film has a framing device which is very Private Ryan-ish, and although most of the ensuing film is concerned with the reuniting of a family, it is to a different point. One suspects that home audiences are less concerned by this indebtedness than Western ones might be. The film uses the `two brothers go to war' storyline, but the peculiar nature of the North-South conflict ultimately gives the family dilemma a wider meaning, their travails reflecting the national estrangement and the recovery of the missing - a thematic reference as common in Korean films as is the shadow of nuclear disaster in Japanese.

Taegukgi contains very violent, extended war scenes full of those realistic effects which marked out Private Ryan, and has a similar epic feel. Its well shot and, even at 160 mins, (Director's Cut length: a shorter single disc DVD set is also available) never boring. However the film suffers rather from a melodramatic storyline, elements of which seems too contrived to entirely convince, including some amusingly telegraphed business [e.g the enemy commander in his HQ bunker, by which the hero is waiting and listening, having fought his way through the lines heard, shouting : ""Men! If they succeed in taking this bunker then we are all finished!""] and hoary cliches like the extended trainside farewell, participants running down the station platform to say a tearful goodbye and all. In contrast, one or two other moments were very moving (one standout is the climactic reunion sequence) and the extended, successful staging of the action scenes, full of devastating modern effects, will make this viewer revisit it again soon. Not among the very greatest war films, principally because of the plot weaknesses, and its sentimentality, even if it makes a brave try - but well worth seeing and I think it is the best war film of 2004.",1103760000,5,2088,4.948717948717949
2196805,5,B0006VL1J2,"This movie will blow you away with its violence, and its heart. Simply put, I think this film is one of the best war films to hit the big screen in a long time. It takes you on a lengthy journey through life with an older brother, war, and honor.

2196806,5,B0006VL1J2,"Call this the Korean ""Saving Private Ryan.""  It's graphic and as realistic as a movie probably can get about the horrors and senselessness of war.  I enjoyed this movie more than ""Saving Private Ryan"" because the focus was on the love between brothers than just for another comrade or countrymen.  Additionally, it totally reveals the worst and best characteristics of man during war.  The only reservation about whole heartily recommending the movie is it violence.  It's as bad or even worse than any war movie I've seen.  With that said, this is a well-made thought provoking tearjerker.",1102636800,6,590,5.030927835051546

Therefore, I generally supplement this coverage with additional materials.  I believe that this film provided a powerful audiovisual complement to the detailed PowerPoint presentation that I did on the Korean War.  My students seemed to be very moved by the harrowing circumstances in which the multi-dimensional characters find themselves, so I highly recommend its educational use.  Moreover, anyone who is interested not only in the Korean War but also in the overall history and politics of the two Koreas would be very well-served and learn a great deal from this fictional, but brutally honest and historically accurate film.",1498003200,3,755,5.266666666666667

2196814,5,B0006VL1J2,"Personally, I have never really been a fan of Asian war films (only a handful I do enjoy), because many of these films usually are stuffed with exaggerated action, cheesy typical war film cliches that are originated from American filming, and rather blunt, one sided political opinions of the conflicts they portray. That being said, these countries like South Korea, Japan, and China recently have definitely been improving on filming. They are starting to get the idea that a war film is not meant for entertainment (I mean as in using entertainment as the film's primary purpose), but rather now tell compelling stories that even foreigners would enjoy. Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War, is a proud example of this new generation of filming. This is actually the first Asian war film that has brought me to tears, a story about family, about a conflict that has been going for nearly 70 years, it truly captures the human emotion and the horrific chaos of the battlefield. The acting is excellent, the story is compelling, and the action is realistic and brutal. A conflict about not only a divided nation, but a conflict between two brothers as they try to do anything to protect one another. A definite must buy! There are its flaws, but it is not on such a scale that foreigners would be conflicted with it. There are moments here and there in the action that are rather unrealistic and some political portrayal that is still questionable, but it does little to damage this film and I find these slips as acceptable. Like I said, this movie is not to just entertain, but lets the viewer acknowledge that this conflict is far from over and the human cost is still having an impact to this day. I do enjoy foreign war films, and this one tells me that the filming community is on the right path.",1487894400,,1801,4.648902821316614

I love this movie for the fact that it shines light on the Korean war, aka the forgotten war, in a none bias way which allows you to realize many things, like how many Koreans at that time did not have the choice as to which side of the war they were on and as a result friends and even family were fighting each other. This film allows you to feel the emotions of the characters as they are going through the war and puts you at the edge of your seat hopin. That none of your fave actors die!

2196865,3,B0006VL1J2,"I taped this off a premium channel to watch, and I couldn't get through more then 20 minutes because of the absolute horrid English overdubbing, clearly done by a bunch of amateurs. I may have continued watching this just because of the high ratings if there was no other option, but since there is the Korean option with English subtitles I'll wait for/find that.  I can't stress how bad the dubbing is - one commenter I read described it as comical - so bad it's laughable.  I didn't find it funny though, and just wanted to watch a good movie. I started off with the subtitles on because I knew it was a foreign language film and didn't know it was going to be overdubbed. This showed me that not only was the vocal acting horrid on the overdub, but so was the translation, as the subtitles were more suiting than the words chosen on the overdub.  It seemed like they were trying to use a more modern way of speaking and with slang as if the war was today and being fought by Westerners or English-speaking youth. If I kept watching I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they tried to insert some fist-bumps and some ""YOLO"" cries before going into battle. Seriously that bad. Completely garbage. Maybe there was no budget left or those in control of this didn't pay these overdub ""actors"" because I believe the average person (non-actor) could have done a better job.  I'm giving this an 7/10 as I haven't had a chance to really see it yet, but I wanted to give this review so others can know ahead of time not to bother with this version.",1388707200,,1540,4.431095406360424

I was so captivated by his performance in that movie that I decided to check out his other films. All I can say is what a masterpiece this movie is. It actually educated me on the 'forgotten war' of the 'cold war' era. This war was so tragic for many reasons, the main one being that one country became divided due to ideology which not only separated fellow countrymen but also many families. Hands down one of the greatest war movies I have ever watched. Also the two leads Jang Dong Gun and Won Bin are superb.

From the very beginning it was good and I still wasn't sure how it was going to end until it was over. The movie makes you go through a whole bunch of emotions throughout and it kept me amazed at how great this movie was.  I couldn't imagine how anybody wouldn't enjoy it.
When I finally noticed Min Sik Choi in his small part and remembered that was my reason for buying this movie in the first place I was so into the movie already that it just made it that much better.

2196877,5,B0006VL1J2,"A long overdue movie from the perspective of the brave South Koreans, defending their nation form the communist invasion of 1950.

This is the heart-rending tale of two brothers, Jin Tae and Jin Sok, conscripted together into the Army of South Korea. Although it was common practice for only one of two brothers to be inducted, war-time national emergency placed both brothers in the same infantry unit. The older brother's ultimate goal: fight valiantly, to earn an early discharge for his younger sibling, so at least one of them will survive.

Enduring intense combat, near-starvation, and Korea's extreme weather, the South Koreans impressively clawed their way out of a major military disaster to almost complete victory! South Korea was an impoverished largely agricultural nation in 1950, still struggling to recover from the tragedies of Japanese occupation and exploitation, and the aftermath of World War 2. When the communist north invaded, South Korean forces and their allies were over-run and pushed to the very end of the Hermit Kingdom's peninsula, stubbornly holding the line at Pusan. Recovering, and gathering their strength, a show down of national will, ...they not only pushed the North Korean forces BACK across the border, ...but pushed them all the way to the Yalu River at North Korea's northern border!

Unfortunately, a savage grudge-match of a war was just about to get a lot worse!

For anyone who has read at least some of the history, this film is an accurate depiction of the suffering of both the citizenry and the combatants. More emphasis was needed in portraying the brutal excesses and atrocities commited by communist troops, however. Although entirely understandable and justifed, this story portrays how even those on the good side had become too ruthless and fanatical in disposing of the enemy.

2196892,4,B0006VL1J2,"A South Korean war drama ""Brotherhood of War"" (""Taegukgi"") chronicles the fate of two disparate brothers Jin-tae Lee (Dong-gun Jang) and Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) living in 1950 Seoul. When a war breaks out, both brothers are made to enlist in the army and immediately sent to the frontline. Rough and tough Jin-tae is determined to make a name and get promoted so that his younger brother can be sent home, while docile Jin-seok, worried that his brother might lose his life someday, would rather stay with him.

The brothers' simple motives develop into something more complicated as the war gets increasingly brutal. The brothers' decisions may change the fate of other soldiers around them, and eventually their own, too. By the time the brothers forget their original motives, we start to think: for whom is it fought?

Like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (made about five years before), ""Brotherhood of War"" is notable for its intense combat scenes that are often graphic. Special effects of warplane attack scenes need improvement, but credible hand-to-hand combats make up for that.

Director Kang Je-gyu (known for his 1999 megahit Shiri) keeps the film moving at a fast pace all throughout its running time that far exceeds two hours. What ""Brotherhood of War"" needs is more time for supporting characters, especially the brothers' other family members. Still, the film remains emotionally involving throughout, due to the strong acting from the stars and convincing battle sequences.",1356220800,2,1482,5.166666666666667

While the title includes ""The Brotherhood of War,"" it's important to understand that the ""brothers"" here are allegorical. There are simply too many unbelievably miraculous escapes, amazing coincidences, and serendipitous meetings between the two brothers. These occasions detract from the film, as alert viewers think: ""Oh, come on -- really???"" But on reflection *after* the film, you should think, ""Well, of course, since this isn't meant to be a tale about two actual brothers, but rather the family of Korea.""

The brothers are portrayed ably by the actors in this film. The subtitles do not distract as dubbing would. The film uses a realistic ""cinema verite"" effect which is actually getting old. There are numerous grisly scenes upon which the camera dwells a bit too long at times.

There are the usual War Movie Standards -- the grinning dumb soldier, the hard case sergeant, the heartless officer, the beautiful girl and idyllic life back home. OK, filmmakers feel compelled to drop this stuff in to frame this as a war movie (Or do they? Maybe it's time creative, able directors drop some of the worn-out cliches with us since the forties?)

2196923,4,B0006VL1J2,"I think Tae Guk Gi is a very valuable and great war film that manages to stand out amongst a crowded genre.  It has it's flaws, but Tae Guk Gi truly shows and tributes the soldiers of the Korean war from the Korean perspective.  It's ultimate being a heartfelt, painful, and powerful open letter to the people who suffered, the everyday people through the harrowing emotions that almost any soldier in war suffers through.  Tae Guk Gi works it's way into the hearts of most Koreans because it's easy to identity with, not being too far removed from reality, and concerns the emotional state that most of us can easily understand.  Plus, it's a formidable and very strong war film, with a hellish depiction of combat, the emotional toll of the Korean War, and manages to, like any other great war movie, say some powerful messages about the reality of the war in question.  Tae Guk Gi has pretty much everything in it to be a war film, and while not perfect, it succeeds and connects.

Tae Guk GI concerns two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-Seok, who are separated due to the Korean War.  While there, Jin-tae, who wants to make sure his brother can go to college, tries to win the Medal of Honor to send his brother home.  It turns into a melting pot of hate and a vicious cycle that neither can eventually break out of.  But most of all, besides being a personal story, Tae Guk Gi looks at the Korean War and examines it, showing how it split up families, caused hatred in one another, the toll back home, and various other topics concerning the Korean war.  It also includes some very emotional and searing dehumanizing effects of war and it's participants, as it can be very emotionally powerful.

I'll get the iffy things out of the way first.  While Tae Guk Gi benefits from a great screenplay, there's plenty of moments where Tae Guk Gi has points that make you question the believability.  The concept of Jin-tae getting the medal so his brother can go home isn't that hard to believe so, but sometimes the battle scenes get a little silly.  Sure, war has tons of acts of gods in battle, but come on, some of the Rambo scenes where he runs through bullets is a little hard to believe.  The ending is especially theatrical, and is a part where you going to need to really consider the improbable in life.  The scenes of hand to hand combat isn't very common in battle either, but it's hard to say because hey, what WOULD happen if everyone ran out of ammo?  The score can be powerful too, but, unlike John William's somber and militaristic score for SPR, the score for Tae Guk Gi has constant use of strings, heavy choirs, and is very operatic, and not as distinct as William's masterful score.  The film could have definitely used a more subtle score at times.

Despite all of this, this film is a truly powerful and noteworthy war film that deserves to be mentioned in various lists of war films worth seeing. The parallels of Saving Private Ryan have been beaten to death, but I think, like that film, it is effective because it presents the horrors of war down to earth and does so through battle and the searing emotional state that affects the common solider.  It presents the Korean war in a way that anybody who has sympathy of compassion towards their veterans can easily be affected.  It's easy to see how this film makes such a connection with the Korean people, and while the two films really aren't any much the same due to different wars and sides, there's no denying, like that other film, it affects tons of people because of it's emotional connection towards the people who endured the war the most in great quantities.

The other thing it shares with Ryan through is the same type of filming of battle scenes, which are often jaw dropping and bloody.  Extremely graphic and very very wildly filmed (the camera almost NEVER stops shaking), this is probably one of the most graphic war movies I have seen, along with We Were Soldiers.  Limbs getting blown off, blood spraying, bloody gunshots almost every time, graphic bayoneting, the massacre of a village where the bodies just flail wildly in gunfire, maggots caught in wounds, it's definitely extreme in it's violence.  It's combat scenes are definitely hellish as well in the basic way, where there's tons of bullets flying everywhere and if you get hit or stop at once you WILL meet your death.  There's some graphic violence not related to battle that's pretty violent too, such as a top viewed suicide and a village bomb that ends in guts ALL over the place.  It's pretty self explanatory here, and they do not disappoint.  They don't have as much emotion as other battle scenes, but they definitely are jaw dropping and smashing in it's depiction of combat.

One thing I would like to mention, is that, while I do not think it's the films fault, the subtitles don't translate as well, as I think this film really works best when you play it without subtitles.  It's native tongue is much more powerful when it sounds like that.  Another thing is the AWFUL English dubbing, which can be turned on if you want to unintentionally laugh at the film.  It sounds like a very cheap anime, and the vocals are so, well, AMERICAN, that it just sounds funny and comical.  Either way, avoid, the dubbing, and hey, if you really want to be adventurous, try watching it without the subtitles after watching the film with them on a couple times.

Anyway though, this is a great war film, and although it can be quite disturbing, it's a powerful and ugly look at the Korean War, and watching it may just let you understand the Korean war on screen.  It's a post-Ryan war film that has it's own identity, and is infinitely more memorable than other similar fare like Days of Glory or The 9th Company.  While a little theatrical, Tae Guk Gi is still a powerful and searing look at the Korean War, one that manages to be painful and harrowing at times, but essential viewing and will fill you with great respect for enduring the Korean War.",1291420800,2,5997,4.57196261682243

Full Metal Jacket, Das Boot, and The Thin Red Line are a few that I truly admire, and while Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War is somewhere near the bottom of my list of favorites, it is still a surprisingly good war film. It's set during the Korean War, and it shows how it affects the lives of two brothers (and the people around them) as they are forced to join the infantry and fight against their enemies. As a Korean myself, I was deeply moved by this movie. It not only shows some gut-wrenching violent content, but also the chaos that Korea and its people experienced before it was officially divided. It reminded me of all the sacrifices made to keep Korea away from communism, and while it wasn't a complete success, I'm still thankful that one half is not subjected to communism. Like many other war films, this is a dark & brooding film, and it should not be watched with an empty stomach. If you love Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, and Das Boot, then you will no doubt love this one.

That doesn't mean, however, that foreign war films such as this don't offer a perspective that Americans can't identify with.  This is a great war movie by any standards. Although Koreans will undoubtedly find this movie most compelling, it also offers much to other nationalities and cultures.

In addition to vicious and realistic battle sequences, this movie, perhaps unintentionally, provides deep insights into the core Korean values of family and education.  The movie is about two brothers. The older brother willingly sacrifices himself (both economic opportunities and his own life) for the sake of his younger brother. The older brother is most proud of his younger brother's accomplishments in school, where he is an excellent student. Towards the end of the movie, the last lines are about going to school and finishing education even when Korea has been decimated and people have nothing left to eat or roofs over their head.

One oversight of this movie is it leaves no mention of the heroic American sacrifices in the Korean war. Over 36,000 Americans gave their lives in that horrible and brutal war. 137,000 South Korean soldiers also gave their lives. I felt the American involvement and sacrifices deserved at least a few lines of recognition and respect. But this movie was created when George W Bush, who was the most hated man in the world, was the US President.

This movie will leave you in tears. The music is very touching and so right for this film.  The production budget for this film rivaled many Hollywood films and was highest in Korean cinematic history.

He works as a shoe-shine boy, is learning the craft of the cordwainer and aspires to open his own shoe store. Jin-Seok, his younger brother, is regarded by Jin-Tae and their mother as the rising star of the family and many of Jin-Tae's sacrifices have been made in order to ensure that Jin-Seok, who suffers from a heart defect, has a decent shot at an education and an academic career.

It was a conflict that I had never given much thought to.  It seemed like an easy war.

""Brotherhood"" (""Taegukgi: Hwinalrimyeo"" which translates loosely as ""Flag of Korea"" or ""Yin and Yang"", which makes up the Flag of Korea: ""The Brotherhood of War"") immediately smashes those misperceptions, leaving now doubt that the Korean war was fought for the Koreans, by the Koreans, against the Koreans.  The American army is only on the fringes, lingering as a faint hope of rescue and military power for the embattled troops.

Jin-tae is told by one of his commanding officers that if he can win the Medal of Honor for bravery, his younger brother would be allowed to go home.  To win the medal, Jin-tae transforms into a veritable God of War, volunteering for every dangerous mission and facing any danger.  He soon becomes seduced by his own reputation, enjoying being a national hero and showing pleasure in killing the enemy.  Jin-seok is tortured by his older brother's transformation, and does not want his freedom bought at the cost of so many lives and his brother's soul.

There are other subplots: Jin-tae has a fianc&eacute; he left behind. Jin-seok has a friend fighting for the other side.  Betrayal and political suspicion lurk in the background, and the story of Jin-tae takes some unsuspected turns.  But ultimately, as the title suggests, this is a tale of two brothers.

As a war flick, ""Brotherhood"" treads the line between modern, realistic films that show the ravages and horror of combat, and classic flicks that showcase feats of heroism and thick emotion.  The battles are bloody and personal, and the hardships of soldiers without enough to eat or ammunition to fire takes a toll on everyone.  Without hope of winning or even of staying alive, the brother's unit struggles with their role in the war.

However, the realism is just a setting for a melodramatic story.  The older brother, Jin-tae, has an almost magical power to run through hails of enemy bullets without suffering so much as a scratch while people die around him.  The two brothers also have time during even the thickest and bloodiest fighting to scream at each other and deliver long speeches.  I don't mind a bit of melodrama, which is typical of Asian cinema, but sometimes belief is stretched to far, and you just have to shout ""Come on! There is no way they could still be alive!""",1233705600,3,4382,6.06645056726094

Two brothers are the subject of this movie and are shown in their lives before the Koren war breaks out. Then the war comes and they are thrust into it against their will. The eldest brother is loyal and always trying to find a away to get his brother home, and he does anything to do, including becoming a product of the harshness of war that we viewers have seen in so many other films.

The story was very well written and the acting was phenomenal.  There were some very gruesome parts, so it's definitely not a movie for young children.

America will never come close to being so realistic in battle scenes.  This movie brought South Korea to their knees in honor of their veterans.  I applaud the technical achievements, the training of the extras, the cinematography, the acting.  If someone said in a previous review that there was overacting you don't understand the passionate nature of the Korean people.

I will say something about the battle worthiness of the ROK (Republic of Korea Army).  In Vietnam when ROK soldiers showed up the North Koreans did not want to get into combat with them.

The story may be War Hunt revisited as two brothers go to war only to be divided as one is morally consumed by it, but it is surprisingly and genuinely moving come the finale (which handles the modern-day framing device much better than Spielberg's epic). Curiously, the film is very critical of South Korea's conduct of the war, both at the front and at home, and all the more powerful for it.

With Korea very much a forgotten war these days, it's good that the DVD extras on the two-disc set include some historical perspective alongside a detailed account of the film's production.",1203120000,,897,4.677215189873418

A tragic plot twist turns this movie on its head with a final savage battle, one of the best ever filmed, followed by a gripping ending.

Instead, the director enhances it as if to suggest that Spielberg's war was not real or brutal enough.

2196963,5,B0006VL1J2,"""Tae Guk Gi"" centers around the story of two close-knit brothers who are conscripted into the South Korean army at the start of the Korean War.  After enduring numerous battles and personal hardships that severely strain their relationship, the brothers find themselves on opposite sides of a battlefield, and are forced to fight each other, as well as the enemy, in order to survive.

Although ""Tae Guk Gi"" has often been compared to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" its storyline also contains elements of ""Flags of our Fathers"" (issues surrounding the ""war hero"") and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (intensely close-up and personal nature of combat).  The most memorable scene of this film, however, was when the brothers were literally torn from their family, dragged onto a train, and sent to the front.  No draft card or induction ceremony (and we don't see the brothers going through basic training).  I think this blending of civilian and soldier distinguishes ""Tae Guk Gi"" from most American war movies, where a clear break exists between a soldier's civilian and military life.  Perhaps the closest resemblance to this blending in America occurred during the first year of the Civil War, when Northern farmboys and factory workers were hastily given a uniform and rifle, organized into regiments, and sent down to Virginia to fight Confederates (this first group was pretty much all volunteers, however).

Like many (recent) American war movies, ""Tae Guk Gi"" portrays the chaotic, gory, and deeply personal nature of war, experiences that those of us who've never been in combat will never really know.  But it also dramatically illustrates the blurring between civilian and soldier that frequently occurs during war.  General William Tecumseh Sherman was ultimately referring to this blurred boundary when he said that ""War is Hell.""  General Robert E. Lee's equally profound statement, however, perhaps better sums up the powerful emotional appeal of this film: ""It is well that war is so terrible -- lest we should grow too fond of it.""",1185667200,,2032,5.148936170212766
2196964,3,B0006VL1J2,"This film is a mixed bag, with the good (barely) edging out the bad.  Many seem to be giving it the benefit of the doubt due to its Korean provenance, and overlooking its flaws at the same time.  As I have married into a Korean family, it certainly pleases me to see a film from those parts getting respect here in the U.S.  However, as an example of its genre (war films) it's fair at best, and its origins don't make those problems go away.

The film seemed to be quite willing to borrow elements from other films, but not always the sensibility underlying them.  For example, the intensity of the on-screen violence is a tacit nod to the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan, but without showing the flip-side of the attendant grief and costs to the soul for those fighting.  The way it portrays the valor and heroism that some achieve in war are reminiscent of older John Wayne era films, but without the veneer which conceals the horror aspects of combat (such as protagonists only ever being hit with a grazing bullet to the shoulder).  The film also explores Catch-22 or M.A.S.H. style jabs at the absurdity and arbitrary nature attendant to war, but doesn't have the guts to take a moral stand and say one side had any more legitimacy or was worth supporting more than the other.

That being said, there's no reason to avoid this film just because it's not the next Apocalypse Now.  It's very approachable for those with western sensibilities, it would be worthwhile to couple watching this film with others such as ""3 Iron"" and ""The Way Home"" to get a more rounded and balanced sense of Korean cultural offerings.",1185321600,,1623,4.588235294117647

Very emotional, very vivid, very gripping movie.  Killer action.",1177718400,,376,4.84375
2196966,5,B0006VL1J2,"""Saving Private Ryan"", starting out magnificiently, fizzled out halfway through. ""We Were Soldiers"", with well-designed battle scenes, had too many characters and may have tried to accomplish too much in too little reel. ""WindTalkers"", so action-packed, came across as overly fantastic at various points. ""Platoon"" was great, but lacked the epic feel. ""Black Hawk Down"", whilst show-casing much of modern urban warfare, was somewhat incoherent and disjointed.

""TaeGukGi"" (Brotherhood of War) - one of only two movies directed by Je-gyu Kang -, then, is as close to perfect as war-movie perfection gets.

Jin-Tae and Jin-Seok. Two brothers, the older being Jin-Tae, sent off to defend the Pusan perimeter during the North Korea's invasion of the South in 1950. Big brother turns hero to protect the younger brother and hopefully get him sent home. After numerous split heads, blown-up bodies, cold-blooded killing by both sides, they are split up with Jin-Tae being captured by, and eventually fighting for, the North Koreans. A momentous and heart-felt climax ensues in the midst of some of the most gruesome battle scenes on film ever (let alone from Asian cinema).

Director Je-Gyu Kang is a master at taking you deep into the horror, the loss, the community-ripping character of war.

The love between the brothers is poignantly portrayed. The stronger and weaker, one risking everything to protect the other, both growing apart in their view and determination in the war, both estranged, one hating the other, until both are united in the worst of situations again, pledging their love for each other.

Je-gyu Kang is also an expert of the contrast of before and after. He makes is very clear how the war changed families and hearts. From the start, where the two brothers and their family are shown together in blissful harmony and joy, only for war to intervene and for them to recollect the earlier good life as motivation to keep fighting.

You won't see any computer-generated armies in Brotherhood but this is more than compensated by truckloads of extras which also help in retaining an authentic feel. The gore, explosions, blood, maggots, etc. (all made from good 'ol plastic and red paint, I suspect) are also real and graphic enough to make you wince - proof that CGI isn't a must-have for a great movie, even today.

History students are also privileged by the movie, which shows the back-and-forth character of the Korean War and the fluctuating reaction of its South Korean combatants throughout.

This movie also demonstrates the absolutely crucial role of a powerful original score. Almost everyone who's watched it commented on the part the music played in connecting the audience with the narrative. It throws the movie at the doorstep of your soul and leaves you trembling.

Yet, most importantly, it reflects Je-gyu Kang's anguish as a South Korean, living everyday in the reality of divided Korea, hoping (against hope?) that reunification can reoccur without more bloodshed, despairing over the many families and lives torn apart as the peninsular became the pawn of bigger countries and corrupted egos.

This is a theme also explored in his other big movie, ""Shiri"" (a film with also much 'contrast', depth and violence), and cannot but stick with you all the way to the end.

Part Korean history (and anguish), part Korean culture (and mindset), part character transformation through conflict, Brotherhood is all a war movie should be.",1175212800,5,3464,5.113274336283186

 Tae Guk Gi (Or Flag of brothers) is the highest grossing film in Korea. Over 20% of the entire population of Korea saw this movie. Directed by famous man Je-Gyu Kang (director of Shiri), this movie focuses on the Korean War: North Korea against South Korea. The North wants to change towards the way of communism, while the South wants to remain the same and not change the way they are. This movie is by far the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, with phenomenal acting, an amazing soundtrack, and characters that fit their parts perfectly. Jin-Seok loved his brother with everything he had, and would sacrifice his life for his brother. He worked as a shoe polisher to save up all the money he could to get Jin-Tae into college to get an education. All of a sudden a war has erupted. Brothers Jin-Tae and Jin-Seok are both drafted into the war, while their mother is left with Jin-Seok's girlfriend, and her three grandkids.  Kang focuses more on the actions of the brothers, and how the war completely changes the way they fight in the war, and each other, rather then a blood festering, pointless action war movie. Jin-Seok tries to find any way possible to get his brother out of the war. He makes an agreement with the commander, that if he were to get the Medal of Honor, his brother would go home; something that the commander thought not possible. Jin-Seok's character begins to develop as he gets carried away with trying to be a hero for his brother, and wants to become one for himself. The ending is the most passionate ending I have ever seen, with a perfect mix of war action, dialogue and music tracks. Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War has everything a war movie should have: an amazing plot, soundtrack, and development.

Progression: The movie progresses at a perfect pace. I never found myself bored, or uninterested. Also the movie is easy to follow, and does not veer of the main point it is trying to prove: Love is something that will last forever.

Sound: The most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard in a movie. The War scenes are done extremely well.

Special Effects: This movie looks like it would have a 200 plus million dollar budget. But it only was sixteen million. Very impressive.

Rating: I have never given a perfect score to anything, but this movie deserves a 10 out of 10. This is the best movie I have ever seen.",1162684800,5,2399,4.539351851851852

2196974,4,B0006VL1J2,"Since the 19th Century, all of America's wars have been fought on foreign soil. Elsewhere though - Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Vietnam, China - war took place on ""home soil."" And this was especially true in the Korean War, the one conflict Americans have ""forgotten.""

The Korean War tore apart the soul of the Korean nation. 35 years of brutal, racist, oppressive Japanese imperialism drove Koreans into depression and hopelessness, but Koreans never forgot who they were - a single, homogenous people with a proud history and unique culture. A civil war, 5 years after liberation? Korean fighting Korean, when the bright future of reconstruction and renewal beaconed?

The movie does not provide insight into the geopolitical events that created two inimical Korean states, but it does grant a fair glimpse into the struggle of brothers fighting against brothers. And it's the JinSeok-JinTae relationship that highlights this.

When the South Korean soldiers fight (one of them says, in a poorly translated subtitle - ""I don't know about ideology, but should brothers fight like this, killing each other? This is totally different from our fight against Japan!"" - this statement shows how Koreans have always viewed themselves, their nation, as an extension of family. Of course, Koreans treat strangers like strangers, but Koreans have historically have much more ease to bond with other Koreans than with other races.

THAT is why the Korean War was a tragedy. A nation divided, fighting against itself. Barely freed, now cut in half; brothers, sisters, families, literally torn apart and pointing weapons at one another.

Americans experienced this once - during the Civil War. But all wars since then happened abroad. For Koreans, war has always been a home affair. To this day, elderly Koreans speak of relatives they were separated from because of the war. My family is no exception.

I consider TAEGUKI a great effort at introducing South Korean cinema to the west and a great eye-opener for history buffs who only experienced the Korean War as a page in their high school social studies classes. US veterans have all my respect, but barriers of language and culture kept them from communicating with their South Korean comrades-in-arms. This movie shows the perspective of the South Korean soldier - and of the suffering Korean civilian.

I cannot give this movie five stars as I did find JinSeok's venture into a North Korean army line unrealistic. At best, he would've been thrown into a POW camp. At worst, he would have been shot on the spot. And it is unrealistic to expect that none of the North Korean soldiers would have failed to spot his South Korean uniform and shot him as the battle heated up. Even if he had somehow stumbled upon Flag Unit, what would have been the odds of him finding his brother? And how would have his brother failed to recognize him?

Further, when the North Korean army captain threatens to kill Jin-Seok, a North Korean private interrupts him and says that an order from ""the front"" had arrived, and that Jin-Seok was to be brought to the front. But WHO issued that order?

From other aspects - the beauty of their simple prewar life, the drama of the outbreak of hostilies, their separation from their mother, the terrible conditions in the front, death and destruction, and the horrible suffering of civilians (the little girl in the Northern village who asked Jin-Seok to find her mother tore me to pieces)... this movie is too much to watch without crying. It is no wonder that I (and many other ethnic Koreans at the theater where I watched this) finished the movie sobbing.

Watch this film. You'll see another side to war - it's far more than ""smart bombs,"" ""Shock and Awe,"" and Patriot missiles.",1157932800,2,3754,4.925632911392405

2196976,5,B0006VL1J2,"""Tae Guk Gi"" is a fine tale of two brothers forced to fight in a war that neither understands.  The older, less literate is protective of his younger, college bound sibling, so much so that he makes a deal with his commanding officer: If I perform bravely enough to receive a medal for heroism, then my younger brother shall be free to return home.  His daring, and its effects on the younger brother is the driving force of the movie.  Additionally, the longing of the older for his fiance is a secondary, yet pivotal storyline in the movie.

The preface to war, were we see the two young brothers, is very wonderfully done.  The war brings about an aging to the characters, and they do look older.  The action is fun enough for any action fan, but the story of the brothers commands the most attention.

The DVD extras are very nice.  One short has interviews with the director, writers and actors, along with real-life survivors of the war.  It's interesting to see the South Koreans viewpoint, as opposed to the American view.

For movie making buffs, a comparison of the story board to the filmed action is very interesting.  A still photography section gives a nice capture of the film, something I'm usually not very impressed with for most movies.

Jin-tae wants to save his younger brother Jin-Seok and realizes he can do that by acts of heroism which if he receives a medal may allow his brother to go home.

At the end of the film Jin-seok in old age visits Jin-tae's remains on the battlefield and then returns home and looks at the shoes Jin-tae made for him. It is simply heart-breaking to listen to Jin-seok at the grave. Listen to this film in Korean with English subtitles. A masterpiece film and even greater emotional experience.",1151539200,,799,4.748201438848921
2196990,4,B0006VL1J2,"I liked this film for accurcacy in terms of weapons, uniforms etc.  Its nice to see attention to detail with Soviet Light and Medium machine guns, tanks, artillery, etc. This film is trying very hard to be a Korean Gone With The Wind and Saving Pvt. Ryan all at once.  I am sure many aspects of it resonated well with its Korean target audience.  Those not of this background might feel the acting and action were a bit over the top, as indeed they were.  As a devotee of war film genre I like realistic action and good production value which this film deffinitely has, but there seemed many improbable elments in it which degrade the qaulity somewhat.

For one I found the one brother going over to the Chinese side and fighting like a machine for them very unlikely.  The combat scenes while intense were often excessively graphic and filled with extra gore. The same could have been accomplished without so much excess in this regard.  Many of the unlikley hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed one step short of an Asian Kung-Fu epic at times!  On a modern battlefiled I tend to doubt lines of infantry could charge at each other like this!  True the Chinese fought using these kind of human wave tactics and UN firepower made them pay a very high price for it!

I think its good that Koreans make a film showing the horrors of a conflict which was both a civil war and war of idealogies.  And its true that many other forces besides the US were involved in this affair.  Certainly the ROK army of South Korea provided the largest elements besides the US.  Also many UN contingents were involved including UK, Canadian, Greek and Turks.  From the UK came many famous regimental names including the Black Watch which provided a stout rearguard for UN forces at the Hook battle, and Royal Marines who astounded US Marines with their level of espirit-de-corps which was unlike anything they had ever seen. And lets not forget the sacrefice of the heroic Gloustershire regiment at the Imjin River battle, where it was virtually wiped-out holding back to the very last the hordes of Communist China. None of this was shown in what is strictly a South Korean production.

I am happy to see that Koreans are learing to come to terms with this conflict 50 years later, and that the emotions of it must still seem very real indeed.  In fact the issue is still unresolved with the hostile legions of the North still poised at the 38th Parellel where one of the last remnants of the Cold War remains. This could still turn hot at any moment!  South Koreans need also to recognize the very great debt their country has for the UN and US forces who saved them from being overwhelmed in 1950.  I don't know if this film does that, but it does show what the price of the war was for that country, and while a more mature approach would have made this epic better over all, I still give it credit for trying. The production value is first-rate, even if the story and screen writing fall somewhat below that mark.",1148860800,2,2996,4.537174721189591
2196991,5,B0006VL1J2,"""Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo"" is probably going to be the first South Korean film that a lot of people in this country ever see, so it is no small matter that the film's subject is decidedly about Korea since most of it is set during the Korean War.  Hollywood has produced relatively few movies about the Korean War, and if you are asked to name one you are more likely to name the original version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" or ""M*A*S*H"" than you are  ""Pork Chop Hill.""  More importantly, the Koreans themselves are secondary or tertiary figures in such films.  What ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" does is to remind us that the Korean War was a Civil War that divided a nation in half.  In that context it is not surprising that this 2004 film literally is about a pair of brothers who go off to war.

The movie begins with a fascinating hook.  A battlefield from the Korean War is being excavated so that remains can be identified and properly buried.  But the computer recrods indicate one of the soldiers they have found is still alive.  A phone call to the old soldier confirms that fact, but what is assumed to be some sort of clerical error at one end of the conversation signals the final chapter of a long story on the other.  We then go back to Seoul in 1950, before the start of the war, when Jin-tae (Dong-Kun Jang) is working hard as a shoeshien boy in order to send his young brother Jin-seok (Bin Won) to college.  With their father gone, Jin-tae is the head of the family, which includes his ailing mother and his fianc?e, Young-shin (Eun-ju Lee).  Then the war begins.

Before dawn on June 25, 1950, the North Koreans pushed 135,000 troops across the 38th parallel in a devastating surprise attack.  Two thirds of the 38,000 man South Korean army were off duty and easily routed by the invaders.  Within three days Seoul had been captured, and only President Truman's decision to deploy the U.S. Eighth Army staved off defeat.  The South Korean government began conscripting soldiers to defend the country, and Jin-seok is caught up in one of their sweeps.  Jin-tae tries to get Jin-seok off the train, but instead the two brothers go off to war together, even though custom dictates one son remain at home to keep alive the family name.  But even in the trenches and on the battlefield, Jin-tae continues to watch out for his brother, making himself a war hero in the process.  Then Jin-tae sees an opportunity to win the Medal of Honor, and be able to send his brother home.

Writer-director Je-gyu Kang follows the lead of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of portraying the horrors of the battlefield in several sequences involving both the South Korean troops being shelled and also deadly hand-to-hand combat with first North Korean and later Chinese troops (one of the film's most memorable scenes is when Chinese troops crossed the border to attack U.N. forces).  But in every battle sequence what is happening with the two brothers remains paramount and the war is only the back ground at which their tragic tale is played out.  Good intentions can be a burden, and when Jin-tae gets what he most desires, it turns out to be the undoing of not only himself but also of his entire family.

Ultimately, the human drama matters more than the battle scenes, due both to the story being told and the performances of the two main actors.  Dong-Kun Jang changes from good-hearted older brother to battle harden veteran, and finally to a man shattered by circumstances.  Bin Won develops a nice arc with his character as well as the school boy grows up, embittered by his fate and what his brother has done in his name, only to realize that he is the one that has made the biggest error of all.  I had my suspicions as to what the framing device might mean for the unraveling of the tale, but I was pleasntly surprised in that the story held true to the determination of one brother to protect another.",1146009600,4,3921,4.5896700143472025
2196992,4,B0006VL1J2,"South Korea has a propensity to replicate what the States had done before.  Few years back, it produced a movie named ""Tube"" that was a splitting image of ""Speed"" and yet, the movie was patchy at best.  Every time I read the flyer bragging about its extensive budget and how it smashed the box office record in Korea, I took it with a pinch of salt.  Yet, ""Brotherhood of War"" was simply brilliant.  The cinematography, CGIs and the movie direction were on-par if  not surpassed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" (TV series produced by Tom Hanks).  In actuality, the technique and soundtrack used faithfully replicated the American versions.  Thus, if you feel like deja-vu, it's not your fault.  The storyline was even a tad similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" with the retrospective storyline going back half a century from the present day.  What made this movie outstanding was the chemistry and bond between the two brothers.  Both of them were from both ends of the scales, personality-wise and yet, the elder brother would move mountain and ocean just to be sure the younger brother would be protected and that he would survive the ordeal to return home to their mother.  Whilst he's got a fiancee waiting for him back home, the elder brother knew of his obligation as the caretaker of the family as their father had since deceased.  This gives us an insight into the Korean culture, which is based on Confucianism.  Anyway, as the story progressed, and as the characters were exposed to the madness of war, they became mad themselves.  Due to circumstances, the elder brother was led to believe that the younger brother was killed and just like Marlo Brando's character in ""Acropolyse Now"", he went insane, joined the North Korea and fought against the South Korea, all for the love of his family rather than for his support of differing idealogy.  This movie was done in a factual manner with inclusion of Chinese in the war later on, the mentioning of specific locations where the battles broke out at specific dates.  Whilst the 2CDs contained a lot of extras and featurettes, they were rather protracted and I wish they were edited further.  Still, it gave us an insight into how this movie got made.  A movie that reminded us again about the futility of war, and how differing idealogies would have split a country into half when Koreans are sharing the same cultures and speaking the same language (plain madness).  This is a movie more suited for those viewers that want to know about war history, lest we forget.  It's not ideal for family viewing with too much gore and violence.

I've seen many war movies over the years and frankly for a long time thought if I'd see another it would just be like all the rest.  But this movie has something special.  Do not look to compare it to other big screen movies like others might have on this forum.

There is a real heart warming and captivating story in this movie.  Anyone with strong family ties will be absorbed in this film.  Granted, there is your usual violence that you'd expect from any war movie, but if you put aside all the action and follow the story you can't help but be pulled into the movie.  This movie succeeds in not only communicating that war is ugly but clearly lets one see the vast impacts on family, friends, neighbors, and even brief perspectives from the adversary side.

This movie is intense.  Have a box of nose blowing napkins around if you invite emotional friends to watch.  A true emotional roller coaster with moments of happiness, despare, sorrow, anger, etc.

It is unfair to try and compare this movie to any other war movie and criticize it.  No special tricks or effects are required with a powerful story like this one.  For many, a good story like this one is far more important than looking for revolutionary industry wizardry.",1141776000,7,1283,4.574561403508772
2196996,5,B0006VL1J2,"Taegukgi is a tremendously powerful movie. It displays the Korean War from a different perspective than usual: the Korean perspective.

The story starts with two brothers, happily living their lower middle-class life in Seoul. From the start, the sacrifices that the older brother, Jin-tae, makes for his younger brother, Jin-Seok, are clear; Jin-tae gave up going to school and became a shoe-shiner in order to support his family and let his brother go to school. Despite these sacrifices, Jin-tae feels no regret and supports and adores his brother to the fullest. This life, however, quickly ends when the Korean War starts. Jin-seok is forcefully recruited into the South Korean army, and in an attempt to rescue him, Jin-tae is recruited as well. Jin-tae is willing to do anything to allow his brother to be discharged, and is told by his commander that he can accomplish this task if he gets the medal of honor. Because he is trying to get the medal, Jin-tae risks his life on the dangerous missions. In the process of these missions, and the war, Jin-tae changes into something that even his own brother cannot recognize. Yet even through these changes, Jin-tae never stops caring, loving, and looking out for his younger brother.

This magnificent film shows the brutality of war and how it can change a person's outlook on life, but more importantly, it displays the intense emotional bond between brother and brother.",1138060800,4,1427,4.991596638655462

2196998,5,B0006VL1J2,"I love Japanese cinema and this is, I think, the first and only Korean film I've seen. Wow, what an introduction. The fact that Tae Guk Gi is about the Korean War alone sets it apart. The fact that it is also one of the best modern war movies is incredible. The South Koreans have a real national treasure on their hands here.

It is refreshing to see a movie that doesn't shy away from realism. I appreciated that hatred for the communists was expressed loudly and repeatedly, instead of being held back for fear of offending North Korea. That's bravery. Also, nothing was held back when it comes to showing the gore of war. The punch of the movie depends on it, and, if you can take it, you'll be rewarded. As another reviewer noted, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It out-gores even Saving Private Ryan, at least in sheer volume.

This movie is almost non-stop action (so it'll definitely please war film buffs), but, unlike with most modern war pictures, the focus is on emotion and story, rather than on action. The love between the two brothers is the focus. Almost every action that each of the brothers makes is rooted in it. Speaking of story, this film has so many twists and turns that it's impossible to know what's coming. This was such a pleasant surprise, since I was expecting a predictable storyline (such as Saving Private Ryan has). I cried hard during the film, which surprised me since I can't even understand the actors.

Note that this disc does have the option of English dubbing (if you just can't stand reading subtitles), but I highly recommend against listening to it. It's not a good dubbing and makes the dialog sound over-the-top and corny, which absolutely ruins the seriousness and intimacy of the story. I would guess that the reviewers stating that the movie contains ""over-acting"" listened to the English dubbing. Don't make the same mistake. Because it's a war movie, the amount of dialog is kept to a minimum, so you don't have to worry about missing the movie because you were reading.

If you like intimate ""brother"" stories, action/war films or just the best that the foreign countries have to offer, then this is a definite pick!",1132531200,23,2181,4.642487046632124
2196999,5,B0006VL1J2,Saving Private Ryan must stand aside in the wake of this authentic portrayal of post WW2 combat. The weapons are authentic...plenty of M1 Garand action. The battle scenes are excellent and make SPR look like a war movie from the 1930s. The love Jin-Tae has for his younger brother provides the heart of this movie.,1132185600,2,314,4.7272727272727275
2197010,5,B0006VL1J2,"Director Je-gyu Kang's extraordinary ""Tae Guk Gi"" was one of the most remarkable films I've ever seen.  Similar in its graphic nature to the terrific ""Saving Private Ryan"" it also evoked many poignant moments as did SPR.  The stark realism of the many staged battle scenes of the Korean conflict surpassed anything that I've previously seen and left me utterly flabbergasted.

The plot surrounds two young Korean brothers from a tightly knit fatherless family based in Seoul, who get sucked into the ideological quagmire that was the Korean War.  At the onset of the film, 50 years after the war one brother gets a call from the army who have been excavating battle sites.  They apparently have found remains which they mistakenly believe are his.  He immediately suspects that they may be those of his beloved brother and the plot begins to recount the brothers' wartime experiences.

The younger brother Jin-Seok played by Bin Won is a cerebral university bound student who is supported in his studies by older brother Jin-tae played by Dong-Kun Jang.  Jin-tae has vowed to protect his younger brother and exhibits suicidal heroism and gallantry during combat in the belief that if he wins a medal, his brother would be allowed to return home to the family.

The story follows the ebb and flow and changing tides of the war as the brothers fight through murderous conditions to remain alive.

Director Kang does a wonderful job in depicting the confused mindset of the Korean people as they get seduced by the promises of both democracy and communism.  The finale of the flick is a moving return from the past to the present as one brother touchingly eulogizes his fallen sibling.",1129680000,10,1682,4.887323943661972

Then we switched to sub-titles, and it was like an entirely different movie. You can really appreciate this movie better by using English sub-titles instead of dubs.",1129248000,17,616,4.5
2197012,5,B0006VL1J2,"No doubt, one of the best movies ever made. Some compared it to Saving Private Ryan, but that is like comparing heaven and earth. Kang has much more talent than that.

I found the ending of the movie to be highly artistic. If one approaches the movie from a realistic standpoint, it is easy to see that

1) It is unrealistic that the younger brother would be able to find his elder brother in the midst of a battleground.

2) It is unrealistic that the older brother does not recognize his younger brother and proceeded to try to kill him. It was only towards the end that his elder brother snapped out of it, and realized that he has been attacking his younger brother.

I thought these scenes were bad because I was approaching it from a war movie standpoint, and it was only later that I realized that this was Director's Kang's genius at drawing artistic parallelism and the stark unrealistic scenes provoked me, the viewer to think about why they were there.

Thus these are my interpretation:

I think Director Kang was drawing parallelism between the relationship of the brothers with that between North and South Korea all this time. When the older brother fails to recognize his younger brother at the end of the movie (a highly unrealistic situation) and wanting to kill him, it is drawing a parallelism that when the North and South attack each other, both sides are forgetting that they are brothers. To an outsider, one ask why Koreas have become pawns of this larger ideological game. Its the same question that one ask when one sees the scene where Jin-Tae (the older brother) trying to kill his younger brother at the final battle scene. The viewer at that point just wishes Jin-Tae would snap out of his craze and realize that its his younger brother that he is trying to kill, the person he's been trying to protect all this time. In that scene, Jin-Tae symbolizes  North Korea and his younger brother South Korea. And that is the message that Kang was sending. This interpretation has been aluded to several times throughout the entire movie. For example, during the earlier part, there was a scene when a soldier said, ""This war isn't like the war against Japan."". Another scene in the middle of the movie was a fight between 2 North Korean POW soldiers. There they were instructed to fight each other for the entertainment of the rest of their captors(the south korean troops). Whoever loses will not get food for 2 days. There, I see the parallelism where the 2 North Korean POWs represented North and South Korea. Both are ""instructed"" to fight for the entertainment of the ""higher powers"".",1128556800,9,2613,4.6797385620915035

2197019,4,B0006VL1J2,"The Korean film ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" stands as one of the most unsparing and harrowing films about men engaged in armed conflict to come our way in many years.

""Tae Guk Gi"" shows us the Korean War through the eyes of two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-seok, both of whom are pulled away from their family and conscripted into the army right at the start of the conflict.  Jin-tae feels very protective of his younger brother and devises a scheme to get himself a medal so that Jin-seok will be able to be sent home.  Thus, Jin-tae begins to volunteer for dangerous assignments, much to Jin-seok's great fear and consternation.  Over time, however, Jin-tae comes to savor his hero status, eventually becoming so desensitized to human suffering that he begins to commit atrocities of his own both on and off the battlefield.  The film raises the issues of what it means to be a ""hero"" and of where loyalty to family as well as to country truly begin and end.

Alternately horrifying and heartbreaking, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a war film done on an epic scale that, nevertheless, rarely loses focus on the intimate human drama at its core - even though the plotting leans a bit towards the artificial and the melodramatic at times (further heightened by a musical score that is far more soupy than it needs to be).  Still, with battle scenes that are every bit as graphic, realistic and unflinching as those in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the film effectively captures the unrelenting savagery of the ugly business we call war.

The performances by Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won, as the two literal brothers-in-arms, are moving and authentic, and the action scenes have an immediacy and scope that help the film override some of the weaknesses in the script.  Astutely directed by Je-gyu Kang and superbly edited by Kyeong-hie Choi, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a powerful film about war and the men - be they heroes or common soldiers - called upon to wage it.",1122854400,6,1940,4.665689149560118

The older brother wants his younger brother sent home, as they tell him if he gets the medal of honour his brother will be discharged and sent home. As his older brother goes on these suicide missions to protect his younger brother from this horrify war that could kill them both.

This movie is not only brilliantly made as the war sequences are truly amazing and realistic. But the acting is extremely well done as the two brothers through out this movie give performances that you will never for get. You become to like these characters that go to hell and back.
I don't really like war movies, but this film had me biting my lip wondering what was going to happen next. This deserves recognition as a truly brilliant movie, better than looking for some guy called Ryan.",1117497600,8,1152,4.454976303317536

2197037,5,B0006VL1J2,"I had never heard anything of this movie, but seeing it at the rental store sparked my attention and it certainly does not dissapoint. Set against the Korean War, this movie powerfully displays the effects this brutal conflict had upon people - specifically two brothers and their small family. The cinematography, sound and effects do an excellent job of bringing you into the scenes themsevles. The powerful acting is evident even to those who do not speak Korean, through excellent character portrayals which immediately speak to the viewer.

Warning - this film is very (emphasize ""very"") violent. The most violent moments to me were the rare dipictions of close-up fighting. These surely occur in war, but are not often displayed in other notable war movies. I really cannot recall a war movie with more violence than this one (Apocalyspe Now, Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, A Thin Red Line... none of these quite close). As a result, this violence might be very unsettling for some viewers - and I will admit, it had an effect on me. Having just watched the movie, I am still slightly shaken by the brutal reality of certain scenes. However, this should not be a reason to watch this movie. It communicates very important and relevant messages to the viewer and offers an interesting Korean perspective.

I only have two complaints regarding the movie.

1) The planes near the end... I mean... come on... I have no idea how these were done but they looked ridiculous. Luckily their appearance is very short.

2) The score was at times innapropriate for the scene, and set the wrong mood.

But these are only minor complaints - watch this movie.",1113609600,13,1681,4.863636363636363

Very gory battle scenes...probably the most gory I've ever seen. This movie is packed with emotion, bravery, and a up close look at the Korean War, probably the most least covered war in the entertainment.",1113264000,6,493,4.395604395604396

This is a violent, emotional, yet realistic and important portrayal of the Korean War, seen from a ground-level point of view.  Yes there were patriots, anti-communists, and valiant warriors, but mostly there were brothers, children, parents...and they fought or hid to survive.

I spent seven years in Korea during the transition from military leaders to democratically elected civilian rule.  Taeguki struck me as a well-done historic film, done as well as Hollywood might have.

Comparisons have been made with Saving Private Ryan, so I'll join and say that Taeguki had more grit, faster pacing, deeper emotional draw, and just seemed more real.  SPR had the money to make more graphic and realistic battle scenes, but Taeguki's war scenes were powerful enough that my wife had to tell me at one point, ""Relax...it's not you that's fighting!""

Bottom-line:  Excellent movie, well worth seeing--especially those with an interest in Korea.  I watched the Korean-language version, with English subtitles and found it easy to follow.  The English dubbed edition seemed to be well-done (I watched about 10 minutes of it), but there is always something lost when movies are dubbed.",1113091200,15,1281,5.297029702970297
2197040,4,B0006VL1J2,"TAE GUK GI opens with a scene of excavators at the Memorial Site for Souls of the Korean War.  Bones have been excavated, a body identified, and an old man receives a phone call informing him that the remains of his brother have been found.

  The bones belong to Jin-tae, the brother who had worked as a shoeshine to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education.  The movie flashbacks to a small village outside of Seoul, South Korea in 1950.  We meet the brothers as young men.  War breaks out, the North Koreans advance and threaten the village, and the family flees to Seoul.  En route they're shanghaied, there's no other word for it, by the South Korean army and conscripted as soldiers in the South Korean army.

  TAE GUK GI is an engaging and engrossing movie.  It employs the technological innovations used by movies like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers to tell the story of two brothers at war.  Jin-Tae (Dong-Kun Jang) is older and rougher and takes to army life to a degree that frightens the younger, and more delicate, Jin-seok (Bin Won).

  The movie is graphic and bloody, and the transformation of Jin-tae into a Warrior is heartbreaking.  This is a movie that feels honest. Strongly recommended.",1112918400,5,1227,4.712264150943396
2197041,5,B0006VL1J2,"Once in a while, which in this case has been years, comes a movie that makes me want to rise above the meager existance to be something larger than life, to be part of the movie. This movie did that to me.

It started with the life of two brothers before the war, a life that was almost perfect until the war shatters it. Everything goes downhill from there. Despite all their best intentions, the two brothers helplessly watched their fate sinking and themselves drifting apart. Overall it's a very intense tragedy, dotted with only moments of hope and triumgh.

The unconditional love between the two brothers, tangled with cruelty of war, made the movie so heart-wrenching that it's almost painful to watch. I can't imagine what it feels like to be the little brother who had to carry this for the next 50 years, not knowing where his brother is, and with the pair of shoes to remind him that they had it perfect for a while.

Being a big war-movie fan, I have watched a ton of them. This one is definitely among the best. Comparing to ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie gives characters a more human touch. ""SPR"" seems to moralize too much, no flaws, just hero's. The result is the characters came off plain and two-dimensional. Agree with some reviewer's comments that ""SPR almost seems like nothing more than a visually stunning, flag-waving movie"". By the way, I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and Tom Hanks, so there wasn't any bias there. On a side note, ""Band of brothers"", on the contrary, is very good.

As for special effects, it's good. But we have seen it all in big-budget Hollywood movies, so that's not what made this movie special. It's the intense human emotion made this movie an unforgettable experience. Hats off to Koreans for making such a great epic. I think this one deserve an Oscar. If a movie like ""Lord of the Ring"" can win something, so should this.

The only complaints that I could think of are: 1. The movie can get quite sentimental from time to time, especially the music during the beginning of the movie. 2. The camera shakes too much during action scenes, probably deliberately, to create the chaos with a limited budget. But I don't have a problem with the length of the movie. The 2.5 hrs felt like nothing once you are drawn into the intensity of the movie. Actually when the movie finished, I wished it didn't have to end, or at least didn't have to end like that.

As for some reviewer shooting down the movie because of a Hershey Bar with barcode, give me a break. I would rather watch a movie like this with 10 bloopers than one that gets all the details right but doesn't touch a soul.

IMHO, Matt Zoller Seitz from New York Press wrote the most accurate review on this movie: ""Tae Guk Gi bypasses academic concerns and plugs straight into one's emotions. To watch it is to understand another country's fears and dreams-an opportunity that does not come along every day.""",1112486400,19,2920,4.561068702290076
2197042,4,B0006VL1J2,"I thought this movie was very good.  It has its flaws (which I will get into later), but overall, it's a very well done piece of cinema.  This film, along with many others is proof that Korean movies, and by extension Asian movies, have grown up and are ready to seriously compete with Hollywood for global influence, audience and market share.  I am impressed with Tae Guk Gi's attention to detail, special effects, cinematography and other high production standards.

Now, enough people here give you a quick synopsis of the story and adequate description of the plot, so what I am going to do is respond to some of the comments that other reviewers have made.  I think my input might be helpful be cause I am a Korean raised in North America and can understand both worlds and explain things that were either misinterpreted or not clearly understood by non-Korean reviewers.

Some non-Korean reviewers have commented that it seemed like there was some over acting or acting ""over the top"" going on.  Well, believe it or not, Koreans act like that in real life.  They are emotional by nature, yell at each other a lot, slap around their younger peers, etc.  Jin Sok and Jin Tae's mother collapsing after the train departs looks like something a Korean mother would do in that situation.  What some non-Koreans would consider as ""overacting"" I would, as someone from a Korean background, consider realistic and normal (give the extreme situations that the characters go through).  Anyone who thinks overacting is purposely going on in this movie needs to join the peace corp or something and get exposed to other cultures in different parts of the world.

One reviewer thought that Koreans fought unusually well given their supposed reputation at the time as poor soldiers.  Well yes, South Korean soldiers did run away and retreat from North Koreans early in the war.  South Koreans were badly underequipped and poorly trained because the U.S. thought their priorities in 1949 were in rebuilding Japan, not stop communism in the Korean peninsula.  It's interesting to note that U.S. soldiers early in the war also broke and fled the field because they were fat and lazy occupation troops formally stationed in Japan.  Jin Tae and Jin Sok were in the 1st ROK division commanded by the brilliant 29 year old general Paik Sun Yup.  The 1st ROK division never broke or fled the field without orders.  It reached Pyongyang before any U.S. units despite the fact that they didn't have as many motor vehicles and was largely a foot mobile unit.  Thus, the scenes were ROK troops are fighting without U.S. support in the streets of Pyongyang are largely true.  Speaking of General Paik, if any of you want to read a Korean War history book that's from a fair Korean perspective, read Paik's book entitled ""From Pusan to Panmunjom.""  It's available on Amazon.

I understand that this movie has been compared quite a bit with Saving Private Ryan.  I have to say that in the areas of intensity, dramatic power and overall sincerity, I believe Tae Guk Gi supasses Saving Private Ryan.  However, in terms of battlefield realism and special effects, I believe SPR surpasses TGG.  To me, the battlefield effects are a notch below SPR, but a notch above John Woo combat movies like Windtalkers.  I mean, molotov cocktails exploding like motar rounds when they should really flash and flame modestly, machine guns blaze without spent cartridges being expended, the tanks look like an inaccurate cross between a Sherman and a Pershing, cannon rounds and grenades alike all seem to have the same size explosions, so on and so forth (btw, Jin Tae does not walk through a hail of gun fire from a ""mini-gun"".  That Russian machine gun is not a gatling-type ""mini-gun"" it is infact a conventional, single barrel Pulemet Maksima obrazets, vintage World War 1.  The cylindrical sleeve is to help keep that single barrel from overheating).  Having said that, the battle scenes are nonetheless highly entertaining and better then 90% of all other war movies.  However, due to those modest technical slips, I give the movie 4 and not 5 stars.",1112313600,193,4116,4.84692417739628
2197043,5,B0006VL1J2,"It's amazing how they get the actors lips to sync with english.

2197044,5,B0006VL1J2,"As war films go, ""Tae Guk ki: The Brotherhood of War"" ranks as a must see. It does this because the movie functions on so many different levels. Though throughout the movie, the viewer may not always be able to empathize with the trials the characters go through, it is very difficult not to be sympathetic to the plight of not only the two principal characters, but everyone involved in the war. Much like many war flicks, ""Tae Guk Ki"" can throw out the blood and gore with the best of them, but unlike so many of the war films of this generation (""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line"", etc.), this film takes viewer through the many transitions people go through during a modern war. The thing is, the movie works so well because it portrays not only the viewpoint of the soldiers fighting on both sides (particular how the main characters cope with the war in their own ways), but also the civilians as well as the political groups during that time period. Furthermore, just as the madness of war is unfolded in ""Apocalypse Now"" , and the loss of innocence in ""Platoon"", ""Tae Guk Ki"" expresses the loss of living in peace, and the effects it can have on an entire generation of people and more.

In the end, ""Tae Guk Ki"" functions not only as a docu-drama (it has been said that this movie is a tad bit too melodramatic and while the movie may have more than its share of tear-jerker scenes, the truth is the movie is very adept at portraying just how much war can scar the human spirit - showing how this particular war still divides the Korean peninsula to this day), for one must remember that there are fictional elements in this movie as well, but also as a severe reminder that war, no matter who is fighting or for what cause, serves only to destroy humanity.

On a personal note, I, myself, am a Korean-American who grew up hearing of the stories of the Korean War (all the more poignant for me due to the fact that my birthday also happens to be June 25th) from not only my parents and grandparents, but also every Korean adult I knew growing up. I think it's safe to say that most Koreans and Korean-Americans are aware of the war (the Korean War has been called the ""forgotten war"" in American history - a sad fact that is portrayed in the smash tv series, MASH), ""Tae Guk Ki"" brings a fresh and ingenious visualization of the horrors of a war that impacted not only our friends and families, but also our identity as a nation for the past 50+ years. ""Tae Guk Ki"" not only functions as an entertaining war flick, but also as a means for people like myself to take that journey into the past.",1111363200,11,2649,4.415132924335379
2197045,4,B0006VL1J2,"If you don't like film violence then Tae Guk Gi is not for you. I thought Private Ryan was graphically violent but this film gives Spielberg's a run for its money in the gore department. That being said, what I like most about this film is that it looks at a war that has not be the subject of American films since the 1950s (Porkchip Hill, Steel Helmet, Fixed Bayonets). I was not aware that South Korean vigilantes executed civilians who had dealings with North Korean soldiers who overran their homes during the first weeks of the war. (According to the movie, these dealings were sometimes little more than taking food from the invaders.) I did not know that the South Korean rounded up young civilian men and forced them to join the army. So I learned something. In addition, the film brings home the absolute horror and savagery of the Korean War (massacres of civilians, forcing prisoners to defect or be killed).

I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie lays it on pretty thick in the melodrama department. The final confrontation between the two brothers is especially unplausible. In the end though, I recommend this movie. It is 140 minutes long but moves along very quickly.

2197046,5,B0006VL1J2,"This 2004 Korean film is about two brothers caught up in the national tragedy of the Korean War.  The older brother is large and strong and shines shoes for a living with the hopes of becoming a shoemaker. His younger brother is 18 years old and the pride of the family because he is going to college.  We first meet these brothers in a happy time when their future looks bright and the older brother is planning to get married.  But suddenly, war is upon them and the family is forced to flee their home in Seoul.  The two brothers are forcibly drafted and we soon see them on the battlefield.

The older brother is determined to protect the younger one.  He risks his life to go on dangerous missions because he knows that if he receives a medal, the younger brother will be able to get out of the army.  The battles are gruesome and real and better than any I have ever seen.  I understand that the director accomplished this with a very small budget and I have nothing but applause for him for this effort.  There's a human side of every battle, and I felt real emotion watching them.

Somewhere along the line, the older brother turns into a monster of aggression.  Not only does he show exceptional bravery, he also shows exceptional cruelty.

This story goes deep into the heart of Korean national identity.  Both sides are equally cruel to ordinary villagers who are just trying to survive.  But one thing is clear and that is the bond between the brothers even though they eventually wind up in opposing armies.  This is a serious film about brotherhood.  And it is also a film about Korea.  Actually, it helped me understand what is happening there today.

The film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it didn't drag for one single moment.  Something new is happening constantly, whether it is the relationship between the brothers, the different kinds of battles, or the horror in Seoul when the South Koreans are executing North Korean sympathizes and the brothers see their family involved.

If you hate watching war films, stay away from this one.  This is surely one of the bloodiest I've ever seen.  But if you are interested in history and in the impact war has on people, this film will help you understand.  It might haunt your nightmares, but it is certainly worthwhile.

Unfortunately many Americans haven't had many vehicles to understand some of their pain and misfortune.........and many still think of Asia as ""another world"" simply because of the huge differences of western vs eastern languages.

Watch this movie, more than anything it shows that all people are the same.........color, language etc......it doesn't matter.  Everyone just wants to love their family, take care of their pets........and be peaceful.

To me that's the most endearing part about this tragic movie.  I rarely like a movie as much as I liked this one, South Korea is a country that has gone from complete destruction, abject poverty all the way into the 70s to become a worldwide force these days.

2197063,2,B0006VL1J2,"Before I launch into what is going to be a very harsh review, I want to say that I DO understand how this movie did so spectacularly well at the Korean box office. The Korean War ripped entire families apart and anything with such deep patriotic themes is bound to be successful. It would be as if someone made a movie about 9-11. No matter how bad the movie is, people will flock to see it. It will be that mental and emotional connection that people will identify with and weep to.

So this review in no way discounts what may be your emotional connection to the war.

Kang Je Kyu (SHIRI) has been described as the Korean Spielberg in many Western reviews of this film. The parallels between TAEGUKGI and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN have been beaten to death.

I must STRONGLY disagree with this assessment though.

SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was bookended by two extremely well shot and edited war sequences that were graphic and raw and shocked audiences with their realistic depiction of war. They were effective because they plunged you into the war-as-hell motif from the get go and also reminded you at the end of the brutality and the randomness of death. In between, there was 2 hours of character development, so that when you finally get to the second battle scene, you care about the characters so that the war becomes not just raw, but also suspense inducing because of the initial setup.

(for the record, I was not a fan of SPR...I did not think that apart from the 2 battle sequences, that it was an effective film, but I do understand what Spielberg was trying to do).

With TAEGUKGI, you get the complete opposite.

We start off with an approximate 10 minute sequence that introduces us to the characters. We meet the current day Jin Seok, who is summoned to a Korean War site to identify items found. Then we are in the idylllic 1950's Seoul and we meet Jin Tae (played woodenly by Jang Dong Gun), who shines shoes and forewent his education for the sake of his younger brother, Jin Seok's schooling(another one-note performance from current flavor-of-the-week Won Bin). We also meet Jin Tae's fiancee, Young Shin (Lee Eun Ju, in about 7 minutes of total movie screentime).

These opening scenes are somewhat charming as we see the love between the 2 brothers and the sets are really good. The actor who played the older Jin Seok is also very touching.

However, the movie quickly falls apart after the brothers are separated from their family.

We are ""treated"" to battle after battle as Jin Tae tries to protect his younger brother, who has a heart condition, from the war. This one-man Rambo takes on entire SQUADRONS in kamikaze missions in order to win the coveted Hero's Medal so that he can send his younger sibling home.

This goes on for about, oh I don't know, TWO HOURS. Relentless battles are really boring. And especially when they are all filmed with handhelds, resulting in myopic seizure since the screen is constantly shaking.

In between battles, there will be maybe 5 seconds of real dialogue, which was badly written and cliched as well as badly acted.

I swear, I groaned everytime a character said ""let's go fight them!"" And the culmination was a really REALLY ridiculous Jang Dong Gun (why is this actor so famous? HE CAN'T ACT!) with a pointy beard and all, fighting on the side of the North Koreans. To further demonize the North Koreans, his eyeballs are rolled to the back of his head, ala THE EXORCIST. You *really* expect his head to start spinning...I kid you not.

There is absolutely no characterization or motivation for these characters. Scenes are dropped in and characters take actions that leave you scratching your head in confusion.

Now, why would I give this movie 2 stars out of 5? Isn't that a bit generous considering what I just said?

The extra star comes from the last scenes, when the present day Jin Seok returns to the site and realizes that his brother died on the battlefield long ago and was not actually alive in North Korea. There is a very very powerful scene in which all the pain and anguish of the families who have lost members due to the separation of North and South Korea comes full circle. This scene was like something out of a better movie and for this and only this, am I awarding the extra star.

This movie is important for all Koreans and Korean Americans to see because it supports the Korean film industry and with the US limited release, if there is enough support, there will be a much better chance of BETTER movies being ported over to a wider audience.

However, this movie, is one from a cinematic POV, that I cannot recommend.",1109462400,20,4610,4.614914425427873

While many directors and writers have prolifically produced films about the Civil War in the US, World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, and other wars from other countries,  few have touched on the Korean War.  Director Kang Je-gyu corrects that omission with this dazzling epic and in doing so, he elects to make the story of that war a tale of two brothers (a metaphor for the North vs. South Korean conflict ignited by the fires of communism versus capitalism).

Jin-tae (the strikingly handsome and fine actor Jang Dong-gun) shines shoes and works at small jobs to encourage his younger brother Jin-seok (the refined and delicate actor Won Bin) to study to go to college to be the saviour of  their poor family.  The degree of camaraderie of these two brothers is some of the most touchingly portrayed on film.  The joy of this South Korean family fills the screen for the first moments of the film, only to change abruptly on June 25, 1950 when suddenly the North Koreans attack at the 38th parallel, forcing communism and death down the throats of the South Koreans.  Jin-tae realizes he must join the South Korean army to protect his mistakenly conscripted brother from the horrors of war.

The remainder of the film explores the progress of this war with great detail, leaving no battle untold and visually depicting the atrocities of war more brutally than any other film of this genre.  But overriding the visuals of the war is the relationship of the two brothers, their reliance one each other, and the gradual transformation of Jin-tae into a well-trained soldier bent on being a hero to gain medals, for in doing so, he is assured that the younger, worthier Jin-seok can return home to safety.

The poison of war infects Jin-tae's personality and he becomes obsessed with killing, a fact that eventually frightens Jin-seok into believing that his brother's criteria have changed for the worse.  The two are split, Jin-seok is mistakenly taken captive as a 'communist sympathizer' when he briefly returns to his home, and when Jin-tae feels he has lost not only his brother's love but that his brother is dead, Jin-tae's rage drives him to join the ranks of the North Koreans.

How the truth of the misinformation that always accompanies war tears at the bond of the brothers is finally resolved in a way that explains the futility and madness of war as clearly as has been captured on film.  Credit Director writer Kang Je-gyu and his extraordinary cast and crew with not only making us understand the elusive history of the Korean War, but also the universal lessons that we still fail to recall whenever conflicts merge into warheads.

The DVD is accompanied by a separate disc that includes the 'making of the film' and a lot of the history of the Korean War by scholars and veterans of that war.  This is a monumental achievement that deserves as wide attention internationally as it gained upon its release in South Korea in 2004.  A tough, yet ultimately tender film, with the sanctity of familial love at its roots.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 2005",1108944000,53,3329,4.830985915492958
2197068,3,B0006VL1J2,"Well, for those of you do not know what Tae Guk Gi means, it is basically the name for the South Korean flag.  Its stupid how they had to change the title to the brotherhood of war.  Anyways, this movie is alrite, its not that great.  With the innaccuracy, this movie doesnt present a good movie,  but the overwhelming drama,  its kind of makes up for the inaccuracy of the movie.  Along with Jang dong goon, and Won bin, this movie is alrite and i did enjoy some parts of the movie.  Other then that, the ending quite reminds me of SPR (Saving private Ryan).  By the way, next time you watch a korean movie about the past times, please notice the accuracy of the movie based on history.  This movie wasn't made for history, but purely for entertainment.  plus, when people get shot in this movie, they tend to move that if they were cazy or if there in a shock then they fall down, still moving crazy.",1108771200,,902,4.284023668639053
2197069,3,B0006VL1J2,"The average GI who fought in the Korean War did not have a very high opinion of the South Korean (ROK) fighting man. I think that was due largely to the fact that South Korea was caught completely unprepared for the surprise attack Pyongyang launched against it on June 25, 1950.  Unfortunately, many people in South Korea today seem to have forgotten that lesson and perhaps ""Tae Guk Gi"" will remind them of it. But by the time I got to know Korean soldiers, in Vietnam and later in South Korea, they had earned a solid reputation as tough and competent soldiers and allies who could be counted on.  This film, in the tradition of such classic war movies as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" and ""Battleground,"" at last exposes Western audiences to the fact that during 1950-1954 the South Koreans fought a bitter and bloody war against intractable and vicious enemies.  The first few minutes of ""Tae Guk Gi"" are the most poignant I've ever seen in a war movie, powerful in their statement of the cost of that war to the Korean people.  It is in this regard that I think ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a film worth seeing because it accentuates the basic humanity of the Korean people whom we GIs little understood and often referred to in very derogatory terms.  The battle scenes are intense and graphic and the equipment and weapons all appear very authentic, which I always appreciate in a war movie.  Some scenes, especially the hand-to-hand fights, are dragged out much too long; there is a lot of over-acting; the entire war is encapsulated in this one movie, which is confusing to those who are not familiar with that conflict; and some of the plot twists are simply too far-fetched to work.  But in the final analysis, ""Tae Guk Gi"" deserves a place of honor next to other foreign war films such as ""The Winter War,"" and ""Stalingrad.""",1108771200,12,1837,4.616564417177914

8043693,4,B0006VL1J2,"This has good actors and the plot is well done.  However, some of the action sequences are up-close & personal where you see just one person at a time.  The problem with these types of sequences is the rapid movement of the camera from one person to another for many seconds or minutes at a time.  I got a headache trying to follow this and had to stop the movie to rest my eyes.  There are other sequences that were good and typical war scenes with views of more people and locations.

I could not watch this movie in its entirety at one setting because of some camerawork done during battle scenes.  It was interesting and well done otherwise.  The problem is that when I really like and am interested in a movie I usually like watching it all at one sitting.  Otherwise I lose interest and then don't finish the movie for days or weeks.",1515974400,,839,4.333333333333333
