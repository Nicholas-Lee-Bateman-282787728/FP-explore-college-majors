8398738,4,B003KK5AOI,"It was with reasonably high expectations that I sat down to watch this movie, and it's with a still-open mouth that I begin to write this review. Wow, I say, wow. It is beyond me why an action film of this caliber is languishing with the kind of sub-par release shown here. ""Broken Path"" is, without a doubt, one of the most violent, well-shot, and consistent martial arts movies I've ever seen. A landmark production for the Alpha Stunts organization, leading man Johnny Yong Bosch, and director Koichi Sakamoto, this absolutely kick-butt movie need only be presented with a worthy Region 1 release to effortlessly become a cult classic of blood & guts karate fare. It's not perfect and it's definitely not for the squeamish, but anybody who considers him/herself a martial arts fan needs to immediately start making efforts to acquire this gem. Trust me, the price will be worth it.

The story: Jack Ellis (Bosch, ""Power Rangers"") has spent years building the ideal dream life for his family, but it all comes crashing down when a squad of bloodthirsty commandos from Jack's dark past attack his home, deadest on murder and necessitating him to fight back with his long-buried talents.

The film has a pretty small scale, taking place almost exclusively in and around a forest cabin, and most of the picture chronicles only the couple of hours throughout which the commando attack is staged. Luckily, the movie requiress nothing else, as the performers take the need for aesthetics and storytelling into their own hands and proceed to let their martial moves shine and do their talking for them. Seriously, don't bother watching this movie unless you're okay with the fighting taking precedence: of the 93-minute runtime, I kid you not that at least two-thirds of it are given over to fight scenes. Somewhat uncharacteristically of Alpha Stunts, there's a definite disproportion between the hand-to-hand fighting and the stuntwork, with heavy favoring of the former, but this isn't a bad thing since the choreography is top-notch. Bosch - along with co-stars Motoko Nagino (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extreme-Heist/dp/B00005V4XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extreme Heist</a>), Tadahiro Nakamura, Anthony Nanakornpanon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warrior/dp/B0034G4P94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warrior</a>), Sonny Sison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadliest-Warrior/dp/B0037TPIAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadliest Warrior</a>), and Dan Southworth (who'd later team with Bosch again in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellbinders/dp/B0038M5VTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellbinders</a>) - lights up the screen in an almost nonstop series of battles best described as a combination of the bare-bones brutality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak</a>&nbsp;and the choreographical creativity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unleashed/dp/B000A2IPQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unleashed</a>. I cannot fully express my pleasure at how simultaneously gritty and graceful these are, not to mention lengthy and creative. If I needed to introduce an utter newcomer to the martial arts genre, it'd be with these brawls.

The movie has its flaws. Where the fighting is concerned, some of the guys overdo the cries of rage - all of those should've been saved for at least the second half of the show. Where the acting and writing is concerned, nobody really shines, but Jack's wife (Pamela Walworth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agenda/dp/B0018TW00K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agenda</a>) is essentially a worthless character, apparently only there to cry, get molested, and occasionally act as Jack's spinach when her screaming invigorates him to overcome a tough stretch. (SPOILER) There's also a confusing instance regarding the supposed death of Dan Southworth's character, but I'll live with it. Oh, and then there's the blood. Dear god, is this ever a bloody movie. I know you have to expect at least some of that, but I was totally blown away by how brutal the filmmakers decided to get, especially after spending the better part of their careers doing preteen fare. Expect to see a knife to the groin, a sawed-off arm, repeated stabs to the neck, a complete 180-degree neck-break, and more perversity in the midst of all the kung fu. It's not a bad thing, the level of violence - it's actually one of the few times in my experience wherein going overboard actually complemented a movie - but if anything's going to limit this one's fan base, it's going to be all that red stuff.

The film is surprisingly humorless, and while the tone fits the tale, it's the major thing keeping the movie from matching what I consider the best Alpha Stunts-related production,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive/dp/B0000ZG040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive</a>. You ought to catch that one too if you haven't seen it yet, but don't forget about ""Broken Path."" This is the kind of movie that makes you want to find other stuff that the performers and filmmakers have worked on - the kind that turns you into a fan of almost everybody involved. Again, I know getting ahold of this one is a pain in the rear, but know for certain that a day of searching will be richly compensated by an hour and a half of benchmark-setting action. Go get it!",1329091200,,5634,6.0299625468164795

8398740,1,B003KK5AOI,The movie it self is 4.5 stars but when i bought this it was a cheap pirated one the case was paper and from other reviews im sure that the quality would have been bad. Don't know why Amazon was selling this in that manor.,1299456000,2,222,3.9555555555555557
8398741,5,B003KK5AOI,"By the seller's own admission...

"" This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.""

this is a pirate DVD so whatever you do don't purchase this. The only legitimate version of this DVD currently available as of this date is the South African region 2, which you can import from various South African traders. Alternatively look on the Amazon UK website somebody there has imported copies.

Now to the film... What can I say except this martial-arts movie is bloody brilliant. Okay the casual action fan might not appreciate this but any true hardcore action fans particularly martial-arts fans will love this movie.

The film starts very slowly as we follow a young family at a rural community barbecue. All seems so innocent and you wouldn't tell what was coming up from the first quarter of an hour - 20 minutes or so. Then suddenly like being at the top of a roller coaster the action commences and you drop down. The next hour and however long you're on probably the finest thrill ride of an action film you'll ever see with virtually non-stop, brutal martial-arts action. The fights are grounded and bloody, bones are breaking, fights are relentless, one-on-one, 2 on 1, 3 on 1, 4 on 1 ... some inventive death scenes and rarely a chance to catch your breath.

This is right up there with the best, Ong Bak, Fist Of Legend, Dragon's Forever, Police Story trilogy, Kiss of The Dragon, Born To Fight, Meranteu Warrior or any thing Tony Jaa, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao has ever done!

Simply put this film is superb and as soon as an official DVD is released you should make this your next Amazon purchase.",1289952000,5,1707,4.7114093959731544
