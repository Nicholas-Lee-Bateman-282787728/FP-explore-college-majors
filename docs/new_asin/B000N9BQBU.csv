8175762,3,B000N9BQBU,"Playboy - Sexy Lingerie III is fifty-seven minutes and was released on video on November 19, 1991; the same date that Sexy Lingerie 2 came out. Each time another volume comes out; I seem to be giving it one less star. To paraphrase that old Wendy's commercial: ""Where's the lingerie?"" In the fifteen scenarios that were presented, they all follow the same pattern. Lady has clothes on, lady strips to lingerie; lady takes top or all lingerie off. The title of this video is Sexy Lingerie not Stripping Lingerie. Most of the time the lingerie does not look sexy or the lingerie looks fake. The only scenario we actually see sexy lingerie is in the one called Body Motion. Ava Fabian (who was in one and two) appears again in three. Most of the Playmates that were in volume two return to volume three with a few new ones. Below are some of the comments after each segment. Starting with Ladies Who Lunch, I did not write any new comments because I got tired of repeating myself.

Homecoming Part 1-Sex scene, hardly any lingerie is shown
Heavily Bodies-Ladies don't look sexy
Fantasy Hotel-Two ladies having sex and a guy watching the sex, some nudity
Body Motion
Easy Rider-Topless sex and some full nudity sex, but no lingerie
Bustin Out-Strip down to fake lingerie and then become topless
Classy Classics
Homecoming Part 2-Full nudity most of the time
Ladies Who Lunch
Anticipation
Lasses in Leather
What Goes Up
Foxy Freight
Shadows

I really think Playboy needs to get it act together otherwise by the time I am rating volume five it will only get one star. Playboy - Sexy Lingerie 3 deserves a C-.",1264550400,,2682,4.9094922737306845
