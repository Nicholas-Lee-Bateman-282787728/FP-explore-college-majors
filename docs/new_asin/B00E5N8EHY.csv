5891586,5,B00E5N8EHY,"first off ... Amazon has the product time wrong (surprise)it is 120 minutes ...a full 2 hour concert, PLUS about 10 minutes of bonus material.

When this was first announced it was touted as being from the previous tour which had me excited ( I enjoyed that tour and it would be film of a show I had not seen)however... it is now properly noted as from the ""Still Believe"" tour and in fact this IS the concert from PA which was broadcast on HD Net.

It IS therefore (and I just viewed it all twice after having purchased it a few days early) in perfect HD quality (one reviewer taking a political shot hid behind a poor quality note). The only minus is the lighting crew often had Ted NOT in the spot so his solos are often a bit less well lit than I'd prefer... but that is a very SMALL and picky minus and not worth deducting stars on such a great performance at such a price (less than parking at many venues).

The pluses are many, great set list, dynamic performance and unlike Ted's previous BR&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ted-Nugent-Motor-City-Mayhem-6-000th-Concert-Blu-ray/dp/B0029W2V8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ted Nugent: Motor City Mayhem - 6,000th Concert [Blu-ray</a>] his legendary original lead singer Derek St Holmes is not a ""guest"" but a full time band member on stage the whole show and adding his tasty guitar playing and his never to be duplicated vocals!!!  This isn't one of many ""truncated"" concerts put out on DVD but a full 2 hour show!!  Oh and Teddy's wife dances up a storm on Wango Tango... he's a lucky boy! Also... In reviewing other BRs and DVDs in my collection I note how many are not only only partial shows but how many pull footage from numerous shows to create one video... this was how it came out live folks, on air one show no redoes ..the way the best LIVE shows are caught!

the two small bonus features are full of Ted's personality and are less than ten minutes in total but good fun..
as Derek sings...

TURN IT UP!",1382054400,6,2012,4.731428571428571
5891587,5,B00E5N8EHY,"THIS CONCERT ROCKS!!  Ted is over 60 years old and he is still rockin with so much intensity its insane!  I got a sneak preview of this and saw about 80% of it.  The coolest part is when he swings that Byrdland down, the lights go dim, and he blasts out the opening riff of Stranglehold.  SOOOOO COOL.  One of the best parts was Derek St. Holmes.  He is such an amazing vocalist and is the perfect contrast with Ted's perfect guitar playing.

If you like classic hard rock, this is for you.  I can't wait to turn this on again!",1380931200,14,527,4.148514851485149

5891592,5,B00E5N8EHY,Yeah Ted's funny but the set list is great. This is a great rock n roll band. Forget about the politics just enjoy the music.,1408579200,,125,4.04
5891593,2,B00E5N8EHY,"5 stars for the songs and this great band. Two stars for ted's rant.

The classic songs with Derek St Holmes onboard ! welcome to this wonderful comeback. the bassist and drummer are absolute pros too. Great performance, sound, songs.
But... ted's same old rant is lousy, boring, LONG, He just talks and talks and spoils the mood of the songs.
imho  I believe this is about rock and roll, and not such a high dose of ted's patriot trip. .
I just edited the songs, just keeping the songs to make a great album except for 2 or 3 so so  songs (fred bear, war hogs, for example)",1403654400,,574,4.247706422018348
5891594,1,B00E5N8EHY,"If this guy would just S.T.F.U. and play music instead of being a dick, I might be able to enjoy. Have seen him many time and lately his noise has gotten so crazy, I cannot even look or listen to anything by him!",1400284800,,212,3.953488372093023
5891595,5,B00E5N8EHY,Ted Nugent & the Nigerian Rebels are at their absolute best on this Blu-ray DVD. The concert is full of energy. The video & audio are both excellent. This is the best Ted Nugent DVD yet. Don't hesitate to buy it.,1399334400,,212,4.195121951219512
5891596,3,B00E5N8EHY,"If you like the no nonsense rock of the 70's & 80's, then you will enjoy this DVD! As you may know Ted has never been for a loss of words, and this DVD has him expressing his current view on life in general.
Add to that his always straight forward rock n roll, and you can enjoy some of his best hits all together in one night.",1397520000,2,327,3.823529411764706
5891597,5,B00E5N8EHY,This is today's Uncle ted performing classic Nuge!!!! An abosolute must have for the Ted Nugent enthusiast from yesteryear and today,1395273600,,132,5.333333333333333
5891598,5,B00E5N8EHY,"Had not listened to Ted for some time and just decided to try this one.  A little shocking at times and not for kids but the energy and guitar work kept me glued to the TV.  The riffs were just constant and ""ballistic.""  I'll be watching it again soon!",1392249600,,252,4.1020408163265305
5891599,5,B00E5N8EHY,"Great DVd if you like old fashioned kick ass rock. Nuge and St. Holmes brings you back to the 1970's with favs like  ""just like the doctor ordered"".""turn it up"" ""need you bad"" ""stormtrooper"". Throw in some great later tunes like ""Fred Bear"" and close it out with ""Cat scratch fever"",Strangelhold"" and ""Great White Buffalo"". If your a Ted fan this is a must have DVD.",1391040000,,366,4.545454545454546
5891600,1,B00E5N8EHY,this disc locks up my player right as the menu is loading. i have to power off then power on to eject it. i have played 100's of blu rays on this very expensive player without even a glitch ever. checked player with many other blu rays with no problem. not a region code issue as this disc is code A1 and i am in america. i don't know what is up. does anyone have a clue what to do? help is appreciated,1389139200,2,402,3.855421686746988
5891601,3,B00E5N8EHY,Bought this DVD because I like Ted Nugent's music and loved his concerts in the late 70's and early 80's. The reviews were also good on this DVD on Amazon so I bought it.  Well after receiving this DVD and watching it I really didn't enjoy it. I don't know if it was the setting of the concert or just the fact that he can't play like the good ol days but it wasn't very entertaining to me. The picture quality and sound were good from this Blu-Ray DVD but the concert  was terrible.,1388016000,,483,4.127659574468085
5891602,5,B00E5N8EHY,"It's about time Ted did a full show with Derek St. Holmes due to the fact that his vocals are a main ingredient in many of these songs, also he is very skilled on the guitar. Some songs are not the same without his vocals. Glad to see, 7. TURN IT UP on this show. This show should have been on DVD many years ago. Better late than never.",1387929600,,337,3.898550724637681
5891603,5,B00E5N8EHY,"I seen Ted 8 times, but 5 of them with Derek St. Homes. Once in 1975,twice in 1976 and once in 1980, and once again this year. And I've said this a million times.""Ted kicks ass every show, but its always 10 times better with Derek singing and playing with him. It's like Derek's vocal and Ted's guitar playing are a perfect match for the music. This is the best Ted Nugent DVD ever. And a great, killer,high octane show. Buy this as soon as possible!!",1384905600,3,451,4.255813953488372
5891604,5,B00E5N8EHY,The musicianship of all the members of the bad is outstanding. Sounds great when played loud like it is supposed to be played. I have no complaints about this dvd.,1384560000,3,163,4.466666666666667
5891605,5,B00E5N8EHY,"I saw a previous review that the quality was poor . The quality is fine .
It was most likely written by a Nugent hater since it was posted before the release date",1384473600,2,162,3.9393939393939394
5891606,5,B00E5N8EHY,"I have mentioned before that there are many things I DON'T LIKE about Ted, but I have also mentioned what I LIKE BEST about him.. and it is all here on this release. AXTV is showing the concert and I had the chance to check it out. First off, THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEEK OF HEART! If you expect to catch your breath for even a second, forget it.. The band is as tight as it gets. To me personally, the mix and HD video is excellent. I am really knocked out at the pure ROCK AND ROLL performance. The band rocks as hard as ANY young band out there in any club or on any big stage around the world. Ted really shows everyone with his ""check this out and try to keep up, Jack"" attitude. This is THE Ted Nugent I grew up with, and my hat is off to him.. His playing and performance is through the roof.. One thing that stands out in this show is just how Ted's playing flows. Some musicians have to really concentrate on what they are doing, but the licks he plays just roll off as if they have a life of their own. Not too many rock players have that gift, but you can see it here.  Ted Nugent is first and foremost, a rock guitarist, and this is the BEST of what he does best.. I highly recommend this show... Holy crap, it is relentless!",1382918400,6,1233,3.9919028340080973
5891607,5,B00E5N8EHY,"This blu-ray is fantastic.  Great performance, setlist, and near flawless audio/video. I'm not a fan of Nugent's politics, but I sure like to hear him play.",1382745600,3,156,5.0
5891608,5,B00E5N8EHY,"I got it yesterday...Oh my God, that video rocks!!! Besides other genres of music, which I also enjoy, from fusion to the most elaborated jazz, etc...in this school, this guy is still a MF icon, and simply rocks!!! BTW musically (and to me politically, as well, even while not 100%, but he is right in many things)...Rock and roll will be now and nowadays just Uncle Ted!!! He is an statement of what real America stands for!!! No drugs, no alcohol (Sorry Ted, I do a little here, but I will vote for against it), outdoors, and respect of the second amendment, or any other, as all are constitutional, and as valid as each other...and he may not be always right, but this time, the time, and money spent in this video, was really enjoyed!!! Hands down!!!! Four simple guys, and three dancers rock a democrat state down to his knees!!!! You will enoy it, just get it!!!",1382659200,3,868,4.5
8601509,4,B00E5N8EHY,"Despite Ted's rants, the music is really good.
I am really glad to see Derek St Holmes back with Nugent !",1524441600,,105,4.0476190476190474

8601511,2,B00E5N8EHY,"I grew up on Ted and love his music.  It's his mouth about non-music topics I hate.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of it on this one.  If you're looking for a Ted DVD and don't care for his political commentary, find a different Ted DVD.",1521590400,,236,4.2

8601515,4,B00E5N8EHY,"If it weren't for a poor decision regarding the mix, this would easily be a five star release. This really rocks -- great performance, great filming, beefy mix. But it's horrible... whenever Derek St. Holms or Greg Smith sing lead, their vocals are buried in the mix. Ted, you have an awesome band with powerful singers. Share the full, raw bombast with the world! Deliver it in our faces!!",1463356800,,390,4.666666666666667
