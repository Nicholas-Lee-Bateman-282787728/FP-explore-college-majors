8112158,5,B000EONU04,"This is a down to earth movie about a civilian police woman who poses for a gentleman's magazine and fails to understand the consequences of her actions until it is too late.  Jennifer Oaks, played by Melody Anderson, feels like she has done nothing wrong by submitting her photographs of her dressed, semi-dressed, semi-nude, and nude body.  She did it on her off duty time and does not think about the consequences of her being fired, how police officers are protrayed in genera; especically women officers, and the harassment her son will take because of her actions. Great ending for all concerned.",1366848000,2,602,4.892156862745098
8112159,1,B000EONU04,"I purchased this video for one reason only...it was filmed in my hometown, and I was an extra in it.  Originally made for TV, this movie aired opposite Monday Night Football.  After encouraging my friends and coworkers to watch it, the next day I had to apologize profusely...it was that bad.

Starring Ed Marinaro (Hill Street Blues, Sisters) and Melody Anderson (who?), this story was loosely based on the true story of a policewoman who posed for Playboy and the consequences of that decision.  Donna Pescow (Saturday Night Fever) played the heroine's best friend and was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal movie.",1283212800,,625,4.923809523809524
