3175940,4,B0017VG5ZK,"- The reenactment  looks real.

- There are interviews with scholars at real historical sites of the Great Wall.

- The documentary also reveals the social impact on the lives of the builders of the Great Wall.

- The downside is there is no subtitle.  It`s very frustrating because I want to do more research on some of the archaeological sites, Ming kings and generals  but I can`t spell their names!

In short, if you like the Great Wall, you don`t want to miss this DVD set.",1329091200,2,478,4.425287356321839
3175941,4,B0017VG5ZK,"The film is a great introduction for the un-initiated in the current state of affairs in China. I visited China about 5 times now and the film did not show much that I did not know. I wish it went deeper in the fabric and the mentality of the Chinese society.

3175943,4,B0017VG5ZK,"The four-part documentary is well done, breaking the phenomenon that is modern China up into its 4 vital parts and examining them closely. The representation is fair, and each segment is well-paced. The bonus disc - the Great Wall, is also well recounted... except for the actors speaking with a fake Chinese accent: why not hire English speaking Chinese for the parts?",1268956800,5,369,4.967741935483871

This modern classic gives a deep and informative graphic lesson on China's 'wonder of the world'. It is value for money for anyone who is a student of China, teacher of Chinese history and culture or anyone who wants to learn about China and its heritage.

It's a great buy!",1228089600,6,459,6.762711864406779

8267533,5,B0017VG5ZK,"Good documentary of China and it's modern progress.  Still depressing seeing the negative impact of change for many people.  Same story throughout China's history.  3 stars.  After watching the second disk on Behind The Great Wall, I had to change my review to 5 stars.  That is an excellent reenactment of the Great Wall and the General who conceived it.",1498435200,,355,4.85

8267539,5,B0017VG5ZK,"This documentary provides a good overview of the recent industrialization of China.  The travel videos focus on tourist sites but this one looks at a sample of the people who make up the majority of Chinese.  In this way, this series is very complementary to tourism and history videos.
The new wealth is juxtaposed with some severe and deeply unfair pollution incidents.  China's industrial rise has not only cost a good number of American manufacturing jobs, it isn't easy on the average Chinese worker or farmer who is losing farmland, clean water, or healthy air.  In this video you get a close-up look at the pro's and con's of industrialization.  It's vivid, and good to see in the video.  It leaves me with mixed feelings about trying to ever take a vacation in China, and more like the 19th century  travel writer described by the author Alain de Botton as one who preferred reading travelogues to actually visiting the sites.  Still, for adventurous and highly physically fit tourists China can be a great destination.",1400544000,3,1027,4.862068965517241

8267541,5,B0017VG5ZK,The Discovery Channel produces some good films. China is becoming a global world power and this is a nice introduction to understanding China's continue influence on the rest of the world. This film is very informative on China's society and culture. Some of this material may have been presented on other DVD's but if you have not seen them yet this is a good film to start your understanding about China. I recommend it for the educational value.,1373673600,4,448,4.756410256410256
8267542,4,B0017VG5ZK,Really helps you to understand where the Chineses have come from there struggles and challenges in the current century and where they are trying to go.  Excellent for researching the country before you go to China or while you are threre.,1370390400,5,238,4.804878048780488
