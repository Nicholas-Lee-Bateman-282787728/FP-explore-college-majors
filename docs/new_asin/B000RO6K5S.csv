8201706,5,B000RO6K5S,"After years of disappointments with the various books on offer from self acclaimed florists, this was the best surprise ever!!  after watching it a couple of times, then buying the materials and flowers I managed not only to re create the flower arrangements but to also understand the reasons behind the techniques and apply them to my own ideas.
This DVD has made me completely addicted to flower arranging. Nobody can believe me that I have not attended a school, that I can do all these beautiful, perfect flower arrangements just from this DVD.  Thank you Joanna !!

8201707,1,B000RO6K5S,Not worth wasting your money for.  Her accent is so thick sometimes you have no idea what the heck she is saying.  Just a waste of time and money.,1275609600,,146,4.0
8201708,5,B000RO6K5S,"I completely agree with the other reviews of this dvd.  In preparation for my daughter's wedding in 2010, I have ordered about 5 flower arranging videos (and LOTS of books on the subject)!  If I could have only one reference for making the beautiful, elegant and classic hand tieds, it would be this dvd.  Each person has their own way of doing it, but this video is, in my opinion, the most complete and most successful approach.  She takes you through each and every step - doesn't leave you hanging with unclear information. She tells you a lot about prep of flowers (good info for arrangements other than the hand tieds), and she is so calm and relaxed and completely at ease in her flower shop, that you feel you are right there with her, and seeing each and every aspect of her arrangements.  Each arrangment she does (and she does a lot of different sizes, etc) is perfect in its own way.  There are bouquet examples, as well as, ones to put in a vase, whether the vase is the large and tall variety, or the smaller ""centerpiece"" look.  Then she ""dresses"" up the flowers in different ways - fruit put around the inside of the vase (which ones work best) and also different leaves, both on bouquet stems and on the inside of vases.  She also shows in great detail how to make a ""water pack"" for a bouquet.  There is so much you can do with this type of arrangement.  Her creative flair is very obvious in her arrangements, and her warm comfortable manner definitely makes you think you can do it!!!  I am proud to say that I do a pretty good hand tied now, although this is something that you can develop over a long period of time and practice and ""make it your own"".  The dvd has a reference at the end to ""further titles"" in this series by this author, but I am unable to find any others, although I have searched the internet!!!  If anyone knows of any other videos Joanna has produced,I would greatly appreciate a note on this product page.  I would love to travel and take a class with her, but that is pretty much out of the question, since I am ""across the pond"" from England!!!",1248134400,8,2092,4.358247422680412
8201709,5,B000RO6K5S,I never thought that I could watch an instructional DVD and so quickly be able to make hand ties as if I was a professional florist. Such wonderful European style flower designs and so easy to follow.  Joanna is fun to watch and the outcome is Amazing.,1191974400,12,252,4.361702127659575
8201710,5,B000RO6K5S,"A plethora of fresh ideas is what makes this DVD inviting and inspiring.  How fun it is, not having to conform to the conventional techniques of flower arrangements!  I guess it is the European/British style of Joanna that flavors them and spices them up for us Americans.
The DVD is presented in a creatively original way, making it fun to watch, easy to follow and best of all, the results are spectacular and very professional. What a treat!  I am buying another one for my florist friend this Christmas",1191369600,13,506,4.662921348314606
