5958143,4,B00EZ4DX6K,"THIS IS A WELL MADE LOW BUDGET MOVIE.  IT'S A PARANORMAL THRILLER WITH A LOT OF SUSPENSE AND TWISTS THAT KEPT ME WATCHING.  THE DVD COVER MAKES IT APPEAR TO BE A ZOMBIE MOVIE AND IT IS ONE, BUT IT IS NOTHING LIKE ANY ZOMBIE MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD MYSTERY PLOT.  WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING HAPPEN KEPT ME WATCHING.

THE ENTIRE MOVIE HAS LITTLE GORE OR VIOLENCE, WHICH IS A NICE CHANGE FROM MOST MOVIES TODAY, YET ALSO JUST ENOUGH SEX TO PERK YOUR PRURIENT INTEREST.

I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE ACTORS, BUT THEY REPRESENTED THEMSELVES IN THE MOVIE AS PROFESSIONALS.

I LIKED THE MOVIE AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S LOW BUDGET.  BUT THEN AGAIN, THERE AREN'T MANY 100 MILLION DOLLAR MOVIES BEING MADE TO DAY THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND.",1381276800,7,758,4.449275362318841
5958144,1,B00EZ4DX6K,"Apparently this movie is amusing to some reviewers who live in Cape Cod. However, even as someone who likes low-budget horror, this movie was just sad. Crappy. Confused.

The main character is a ""successful"" 30-something romance writer, who appears to be a virgin, or at least has never had an orgasm if she has managed to have sex, and the utterly unbelievable tripe we're forced to watch her write (stealing various lines from other bad novels, like ""It was a dark and stormy night"") mirrors the bad-romance-novel level that the movie script is written on.

SPOILERS AHEAD: Much of the movie simply makes no sense whatsoever. Contra the title, the dead are not naked (okay perhaps 15 seconds) and are, in a completely unexplained way, the corporeal time-traveling ghosts of people who died 50 years earlier. There's a dark-haired character seen several times in ""a house location"" with utterly no function in the plot, no explanation, and as far as I could tell wasn't in the house where the action took place. The handyman exclaims that he knows all the deputies on the island in one scene, and a named deputy in particular, then fails to notice that the ""deputy"" isn't anyone he knows in the next scene - but thinks he's ""creepy"" while not noticing that he's supposed to be the named deputy.

The romance writer hands the girl a chaste nightgown to wear, gives the girl her room, and then fails to comment on the fact that the girl ransacks her wardrobe and tries on a succession of her racy nightgowns without permission. A dance scene occurs in the middle of the movie, for no reason whatsoever. New people walk into the house and wander around, repeatedly, without knocking or encountering locked doors, even though the romance writer is alone and freaked out by the completely unexplained (ever) green sky and clouds.

Admittedly, I did enjoy watching the handyman down an endless stream of utterly-no-label beers, which magically appeared where ever he was all through the movie, without becoming the slightest bit drunk. The actor consumed beverages very realistically.

And to top it all off, the corporeal time-traveling dead girl ends the movie as a current hollywood star - because apparently you don't need a birth certificate, ID, or a social security number to be employed in Hollywood.",1392681600,,2303,4.894871794871795
5958145,5,B00EZ4DX6K,"I LOVED this movie because of the ""bizarre"" elements...... from an eclectic antique house, to some strange characters, it kept me entertained.  I'm so sick of watching shows that have blood and guts or no basic story line. I remember being so disappointed in Paranormal after it got awesome reviews and was allegedly a true story.  For two hours I watched a couple people film a bedroom, YAWN.  Not to cut down another flick, but I read some mixed reviews on this one and for me, I enjoyed the different characters, different scenery, and the elements of eerie-ness!  I hope there is a Part Two.........................

5958146,4,B00EZ4DX6K,I'm glad I bought this movie (as opposed to renting/streaming it) so I can watch it again with friends and family. The movie is very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next. If you like blood and boobs this is the movie for you! Very intriguing plot.,1389657600,,298,4.245614035087719

5958148,4,B00EZ4DX6K,"Night of the Naked Dead

You see, I understood I was about to watch a horror film, a genre I avoid because it leaves me too often with aftervisions I dislike.  Carl Back kind of encouraged me to think I would like this film, however, and I did like it.  Some of the dialogue was terrific, for example.

This film is for many Cape Codders because it has caricatures of folk either with whom we're familiar directly or with whom we're familiar second hand because people we know have described firsthand encounters.

My Cape Cod friend and I were waiting very hard for our fiend Carl Back to enter the film, and he doesn't enter until about half way through.  My friend says, ""Oh there's Carl; I guess he's a bad guy.""  She was watching the film more acutely than I was!  Right, Carl plays the ruthless businessman come to exploit Cape Cod for it's cash value.  I thought he did a great job; I wasn't expecting so much humor in the film!

Maybe the story coalesces into coherent piece in a way that I found satisfying?  Anyway, the film ended very well.

5958149,3,B00EZ4DX6K,"This movie is kinda plodding and fairly predictable.  The on-screen presence of the actors is a little lacking (i.e. amateurish) and the story isn't very compelling.  But, it's an ok way to burn 1.5 hrs one afternoon when you've got nothing else to do.",1388102400,,252,4.704545454545454
5958150,5,B00EZ4DX6K,"I live in Cape Cod, MA. That is where this film was shot. The environs are familiar to me. The natural eeriness is also here at times. Then, spooky people start arriving at the house which itself is haunted. The story was intriguing, the acting was sharp and the plot moved along with a few twists here and there.

Overall, I enjoyed this film which was the director's first attempt at a feature film with a very low budget. I look forward to his next effort and hope the suspense....increases.",1387584000,2,494,4.488888888888889
5958151,2,B00EZ4DX6K,Low budget movie with a good script but it wasn't much of a zombie movie. The eye candy was the only good thing about the film itself.,1384041600,8,134,4.0
5958152,2,B00EZ4DX6K,"First of all, the dead were not naked.  There is only a couple seconds of nudity in the whole movie.  The preview look good; funny and I like low budget movies as a general rule but found this one confusing and boring.  The plot did not make a lot of sense .  The acting was bad, but that's ok, bad acting is sometimes funny, but with all the other flaws, it was tough to finish watching the whole movie.  I took me three different sessions.",1383523200,18,441,4.141176470588236

8610624,1,B00EZ4DX6K,"There was a strange girl in the movie that didn't do any thing but laugh, a naked old man that didn't do any thing, a handy man with no ID, and no sound explanation of why. If some one asked me ""What was your favorite part?"" I honestly couldn't give an answer because none of it was good enough.",1474329600,2,295,4.016949152542373
8610625,1,B00EZ4DX6K,"Emma owns a nice Bed and Breakfast on Cape Cod with a secret room, a view of the marsh,  an overdue mortgage, and writer's block. Strange unexplained weather knocks out electricity except for Emma's generator. Veronica (Alexandra Creteau) shows up at her door naked and with a Russian accent thinking it is 1957. Other strange things happen as what is going on is not fully explained midst the choppy low budget sound.

We never get to see the girl on the DVD cover as this is NOT A ZOMBIE FILM as one would think. The acting is also bad. Sarah Michelle was unconvincing in her role described as a zombie woman. Junius Podrug wrote, directed, and produced this film. He hadn't done anything before this or since according to IMDB.
