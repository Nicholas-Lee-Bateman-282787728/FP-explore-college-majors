3425357,5,B001990LL4,"I loved this show when it was on TV and have seen the reruns many times.  Season 6 (as well as 1,2,3,4 and 5) are all great.  There was no stone left unturned with the subjects they covered in this series.  The network may have killed it in season 6 but there was 2 additional movies that came out about 10 years later.  The acting is great, the story lines may be campy at times, but all in all the drama and acting is first class all the way.  The sharp wit of Cagney and the motherly qualities of Mary Beth balanced each other out beautifully.  One special team of partners that have gone down in the annuals of tv history.  Long live Cagney and Lacey.  (and with the new releases of Seasons 1-6 and the movies they will live on forever).",1219017600,4,741,4.169014084507042
3425358,5,B001990LL4,"Season Six discussed such hot topics as AIDS, domestic abuse, and friendly fire.  It also was, unfortunately, the end of a great show - the series ending two-parter was nothing but quality drama at its highest.  I can't wait until this season is available on DVD.",1210377600,3,263,4.695652173913044
3425359,5,B001990LL4,"I have watched Season 6 of C&L many times. There is no doubt that the series is one of the very best. 25 years later, fans still rave about it and newcomers who see it are enthralled. This is one show that is still serious, relevant, funny, and controversial. Television programming does not get any better than this. For all six seasons, the two leads, Tyne Daly(4) and Sharon Gless(2) won the Emmy for best dramatic actress. Simply THE BEST !",1210377600,3,444,4.493827160493828

8272589,4,B001990LL4,Wished it was a 2hr special.  Situations like this episode are still happening  today.  Take for instance what happened in real life to the little girl who played Shauna Bard. Emotionally and Physically abused. Then to die I cruel death. She was only 10 when she passed away. All caused by one who should have loved her. Not despise her. Her DAD!!!.  May you rest in peace little child. with love Blessed be.,1356480000,,408,4.5479452054794525

8272591,5,B001990LL4,"PArt I and 2 of Turn, Turn, Turn are riveting. These ladies are at their top form in these episodes and what fine form it is. Nothing short of brilliant work from Sharon Gless as she loses her struggle with alcohol. Highly recommended.",1278115200,2,235,4.488372093023256
