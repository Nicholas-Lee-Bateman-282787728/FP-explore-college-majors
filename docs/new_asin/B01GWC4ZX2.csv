8764075,5,B01GWC4ZX2,"Down through time it is easy to get the ""support your local"" films mixed up. This is the first. This is an educational film teaching you everything from sharing to proper gun pointing etiquette. Everyone has his or her favorite part in this movie. It contains sight gages, puns, and jokes (some take time to think about.)

I will not go into detail incase you have not seen this as it is fun to watch the story unfold. However, it is several overlapping stories tied together by Jason McCullough (James Garner) who has spent four years on his way to Australia and stops for a little gold prospecting. He needs a job to buy food while prospecting, as the position of sheriff is available.

O.K. I cannot help it. He is handed the badge with a dent from a bullet in it.

 James Garner: This must have saved his life.

Harry Morgan: It would have, if it weren't for all those other bullets.

 This movie may not have all the DVD goodies you look for but it is DVD so it will last as long as the technology.",1501545600,,1003,4.303191489361702
