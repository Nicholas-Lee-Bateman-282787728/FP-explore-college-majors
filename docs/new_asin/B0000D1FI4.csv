1920623,1,B0000D1FI4,"Tormented is a fabulously cheesy Bert I. Gorden opus featuring some laugh-out-loud hilarity, but this packaging is the pits. The film can be purchased in other collections and on its own for a couple of bucks, but this one is supposedly retrofitted for 3-D via those red & blue glasses they used to make. I have no idea how it does or doesn't help the film (which wasn't filmed in 3-D), because they don't include the 3-D glasses with the DVD!!  This is ridiculous, since you can't watch the film without them and those glasses, cheap as they are, are not easy to find. And why should you have to? At this inflated price and with pictures of the 3-D glasses all over the packaging, who is going to even pay attention to the wording that says ""requires 3-D glasses"" instead of ""includes 3-D glasses."" I only hope that I can get my money back for this aggravating rip-off.

As for Tormented, definitely program it for a Bad Movie night, maybe even with the Mystery Science 3000 version, because scenes like the one where the dead ex-lover's head bobs around shrieking ""Tom Stewart killed me! Tom Stewart killed me!"" have to be seen to be believed.",1348272000,,1145,4.553398058252427
1920624,3,B0000D1FI4,"Tormented(1960) is a decent, unique, supernatural horror film from director Bert I. Gordon. A jazz musician(Richard Carlson) lets his sexy, well-endowed mistress(Juli Reding) die in an accident so he can marry a rich woman. She comes back from the grave as a ghost and she...torments him! Susan Gordon plays a 12 year old girl who suspects the piano player is guilty of something. Juli Reding was ten times sexier than Marilyn Monroe and she never reached stardom! Joel and the Robots from Mystery Science Theater 3000 did poke fun of this movie. Keep in mind that Tormented is also a British horror film made in 2009. Albert Glasser wrote the music score for Tormented(1960); keep in mind, it uses stock music from House on Haunted Hill(1959). Susan Gordon is adorable as 12 year old Sandy. Some people may remember her from a Twilight Zone episode. Some people claim that the international version of Tormented(1960) has alternate scenes of a nude Juli Reding! Tormented is a fun piece of cheese and it's worth watching if you can find it on late night TV or a budget DVD.",1307318400,7,1074,4.779569892473118
1920625,4,B0000D1FI4,My wife saw this movie when she was young. Could not find a copy anywhere. Was very happy and surprised to see it after so long. Thank you.,1306972800,,139,4.0
1920626,3,B0000D1FI4,"I never thought my first review would be a review to correct what seems like a case of mistaken identity.

this is NOT a slasher movie nor is it about teen kids. This is a 1960 ""ghost"" movie which was more recently featured on one of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000's"" dvd collection.

It's not a great movie but there is some greatness in there. If one were to just think of the story being told one could easily imagine a more up to date less kitschy version being made. I recently saw the ""Mystery Science Theater"" version and really enjoyed ""the whole package"". Can one enjoy this movie without the added comedy track? Possibly but one must be forgiving of the special effects and some of the over the top acting. It's not so bad but I suspect this movie would have been more disturbing when I was a child. I give it three stars because there is ""something there"" but one must have an open mind or see the ""mystery science theater"" version in order to enjoy.

But again, this is NOT a slasher film!",1298073600,,1000,4.365591397849462
1920627,2,B0000D1FI4,"Although he was never an A-List star, Richard Carlson was much in demand during the 1950s, for he projected both masculinity and intellectualism in equal proportions.  He also became something of a covert gay icon when he stepped out of the water wearing the form fitting bathing suit of the day in the memorable 1954 CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON.  As the 1950s wore on, Carlson found himself working more in television than in films, and the 1960 TORMENTED would be one of his few big screen efforts  after 1959.

The film was based on a story from and directed by Bert I. Gordon, whose claim to fame up to this point were B-movies like THE BEGINNING OF THE END and EARTH VS. THE SPIDER; he would go on to create similar B-flicks with PICTURE MOMMIE DEAD and EMPIRE OF THE ANTS, spinning out quite a few films that have become late-night ""So Bad It's Good"" cult favorites.  But unfortunately for every one concerned, TORMENTED is neither good enough to be good nor bad enough to be amusing.

The story concerns Tom Stewart (Richard Carlson), a jazz pianist with an impending performance at Carnegie Hall and and upcoming marriage to wealthy socialite Meg Hubbard (Lugene Sanders.) Alas, he also has a woman in his past: a singer named Vi (Juli Reding), and when our story begins she has come to raise hell about his impending marriage.  For reasons never explained--there's a lot of ""for reasons never explained"" in this movie--they have met in an abandoned light house, and Tom doesn't put out a helping hand when Vi plunges to her death.

It's an interesting opener, but everything goes downhill from that point.  Needless to say, Tom is soon tortured by the ghost of Vi, who appears in the form of transparent double exposures, a crawling hand on the living room floor, and even a disembodied head that suddenly turns into a very obvious wig stand when Tom decides to wrestle with it.  Things go along pretty much as you would expect and the whole thing ends up just as you thought it would.

The story would be better described as a traditional ghost story with a lyric bent than as a horror movie per se, and the concept isn't without interest--but it doesn't do anything with it.  The cast is above average for this sort film, and fans of Carlson will be glad to see him back in his swimsuit once more, even if the years since CREATURE have taken a toll.  But although Carlson and company give it their all--it just doesn't go anywhere worth the effort.  There are some truly hilarious moments (the head-wrestling a case in point) and a few ""what were they thinking"" moments (most particularly a blind real estate agent, of all things), but they aren't enough to tip the thing over into  So Bad It's Good territory.  To add insult to injury, the print is none too good--but then, given the low budget, it probably never was very good to begin with.

Fans of Richard Carlson will find it worth watching at least once, as will fans of director Bert I. Gordon--but for most people once will be enough.

1920628,4,B0000D1FI4,"Tormented is one of the more interesting of the old black and white horror movies, though not one of the scariest.

Richard Carlson (It Came From Outer Space, Riders To The Stars)  is planning to get married on a small island, but his old girlfriend confronts him in the lighthouse, threatening to spoil his new relationship, insisting she still wants him.  When the railing breaks and she falls, he has a chance to save her life and pull her back up, but sees a chance to solve his problem and lets her fall to her death in the ocean below.

Throughout the rest of the movie the ghost of the woman haunts him - you see her footprints in the sand, her disembodied hand and then head - while he tries to go through with his wedding.  But that's not all - the plot takes some interesting turns as the sailor who brought the old girlfriend to the island schemes blackmail, then the ghost taunts Carlson into murdering him, but his fiancee's sweet little sister is watching.

Unfortunately to me the ghostly gimmicks weren't scary.  Perhaps I've seen too many more effective horror movies.  But the story was interesting anyway.",1126396800,,1124,4.585
1920629,3,B0000D1FI4,"Richard Carlson (creature from the black lagoon, it came from outer space) is Tom Stewart, jazz pianist and sophisticated international playboy. Tom lives on a small island in peace and harmony with the sea. He's about to get married to Meg (Lugene Sanders), when a former girlfriend named Vi (Juli Reding) shows up to confront him alone. This would be great except that they're standing at the top of a lighthouse at the time. NOT a good spot for a heated argument as it turns out! Vi falls to her death after a rickety rail gives way and Tom refuses to pull her to safety. Splat! Gurgle! Glub! Thus begins the haunting terror of TORMENTED! You see, Vi is so annoying that she simply must return from her watery grave in order to bother Tom some more. She is the most tedious ghost ever! Of course, this is a Bert I. Gordon production, so nothing is subtle or mysterious. Instead of an eerie psychological thriller, we get a movie full of crawling hands, floating heads, and ghostly footprints. Astonishingly, it all works rather well somehow. Still, I couldn't help but wonder how much better it would have been if the supernatural aspects had been left more to the imagination (sigh). If you liked HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, 13 GHOSTS, ETC., then this one fits right in. -Special credit for Susan Gordon, the cute little girl in the movie. She never made me roll my eyes or want to puke once! That's incredible!...",1118188800,2,1413,4.611111111111111
1920630,3,B0000D1FI4,"B movie maven Bert I. Gordon brought us TORMENTED in the early sixties, not long after the prime psychological thriller PSYCHO filled audience's hearts with a new kind of fear---not monsters, but monsters within us.  In TORMENTED, Richard Carlson mugs his way through the role of jazz pianist Tom Stewart, who tells his latest mistress (played by the bosomy Juli Reding) that their affair is over and he is planning on marrying the wealthy daughter of a corporate giant.  She taunts him and in an accident at the lighthouse, she falls to her death.  Tom could have saved her, but he lets her die.  The movie grows a little tedious as we wonder if Tom's guilty conscience is getting the better of him, or is the ghost of Vi walking the beaches?  The special effects are appropriately laughable and the ending is telegraphed from the moment Vi falls to her death, but for a psychological B movie ala DEMENTIA 13, TORMENTED is fairly enjoyable.",1111276800,3,941,4.713414634146342
1920631,3,B0000D1FI4,"The most interesting thing about ""Tormented"" (by the Sea-Ghost of Haunted Island) is that this 1960 horror B-movie wants to have it both ways and combine the supernatural with the psychological.  On an island off the coast of New England, jazz pianist Tom Stewart (Richard Carlson from ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"") is preparing to get married.  But his old girl friend, Vi Mason (Juli Reding), shows up refusing to let him go.  They have their conversation at the top of an abandoned lighthouse and when the rail gives way, Vi is left dangling over the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.  Tom fails to act and Vi falls to her death.  This would seem to solve Tom's problem, but then strange things happen.  Tom thinks he sees Vi's body floating in the ocean, but when he brings it to shore it turns out to be a bunch of seaweed.  Is Tom's guilt gnawing away at him?  It seems so, but then while walking back across the beach we see another set of footprints following him even though there is nobody there.

As the wedding day to Meg Hubbard (Lugene Sanders) approaches, more strange things keep happening to Tom.  Some of them could be the work of Tom's imagination, and maybe he is thinking he is just going a bit crazy, but then Mrs. Ellis (Lillian Adams), the blind housekeeper (yes, really), says she can smell Vi's perfume and even little Sandy Hubbard (Susan Gordon, the director's daughter), Meg's little sister, starts seeing things she should not be seeing.  Tom wants to ignore the ghostly apparitions and disembodied body parts, but he also has to contend with the shifty Nick (Joe Turkel), who brought Vi over to the island.  She owes him $5 but is nowhere to be seen.  Since Tom is really nervous about the subject, Nick figures there is something going on and puts the squeeze on the bridegroom.  This can only end badly and if you do not know how Tom is going to die in this one then you have no grasp of the obvious.

None of the performances are laughable and Carlson certainly tries hard in this one, but when you get to the disembodied head scene you are going to start laughing because you will not be able to help it, especially when Tom picks up the ""head.""  The dead Vi, reaching out from beyond her watery grave to take her vengeance on Tom, is more interesting than the living Meg, so it is hard not to be sympathetic with the ghost.  But there are some nice atmospheric moments despite the problematic special effects, and Susan Gordon avoids becoming one of those unbearably cute kids and at least she appreciates the seriousness of the situation.  Then there is the ending, which actually provides a nice little ghost story twist, even if the execution of the scene tends towards the melodramatic.  That is why ""Tormented"" is one of those B-movies where the bad parts are often more entertaining than the good parts.

In case you did not notice up front, ""Tormented"" is directed by Bert I. Gordon, who also gets credit for the story, with a script is by George Worthing Yates.  This is the same Bert I. Gordon who brought us ""King Dinosaur,"" ""Beginning of the End,"" ""The Cyclops,"" ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" ""Attack of the Puppet People,"" ""War of the Colossal Beast,"" ""Earth vs. the Spider"" (a.k.a. ""Earth vs. the Giant Spider""), and ""The Boy and the Pirates"" before he made ""Tormented.""  After Roger Corman the man called B.I.G. was one of the most distinctive makers of monster B-movies in the late 1950s, working with his wife, Flora, to create the not-so-special special effects, usually for American International Pictures.  ""Tormented"" is one of his more intimate efforts, but it still shows the distinctive B.I.G. touch.",1108080000,4,3692,4.654853620955316

1920672,4,B0000D1FI4,"Of the countless number of late night low budget horror movies that I saw on TV as a kid, none scared me more than TORMENTED did. It's basically a B movie version of 1944's THE UNINVITED with a little of A PLACE IN THE SUN thrown in for good measure. Jazz pianist (Richard Carlson) is getting ready to marry his wealthy fiance' (Lugene Sanders) but ex-girlfriend (Marilyn Monroe lookalike Juli Reding) threatens to tell all. During an argument at the local lighthouse, she falls to her death when Carlson fails to help her. Now the wedding can proceed without a hitch, right? WRONG! Reding comes back as a vengeful ghost who eventually gets her man but not before some serious haunting occurs that includes disembodied body parts and an interrupted wedding ceremony. It was the ceremony with its wilting flowers and windblown prayer book along with the final appearance of the ghost that really got me. At age 10 it gave me bad dreams (and a fear of blondes). Today I can enjoy it for what it is, a cheap but well made ghost story .

Director Bert I. Gordon (Mister B.I.G.) is best known for his bargain basement, special effects laden ""extravaganzas"" such as THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN and THE FOOD OF THE GODS but here, not having to make things large or backgrounds small, his effects are surprisingly ""effective"". Up to this point I had always seen Richard Carlson as a good guy in movies like CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. Seeing him play a murderer was a little unsettling. I was also fascinated with lighthouses and this was the first time I had seen a movie involving a haunted one which is why it made such an impression. This new Warner Archive DVD of TORMRNTED uses a first generation print that looks better than it did on my TV all those years ago. Now I can have my cake and eat it too. Relive my childhood memories and yet sleep soundly at night. I'm also no longer afraid of blondes. Incidentally the Malibu beach house seen in the movie is the same one used at the end of KISS ME DEADLY. Both movies were shot by the great noir cameraman Ernest Laszlo.",1383609600,9,2098,4.5065616797900265

A word of caution, threats are never considered terms of endearment especially when you're being dumped by a geezer bent on marrying a much younger woman.  Unfortunately, poor jazz pianist Tom Stewart (Richard Carlson) tries to letdown his old girlfriend on the cusp of his marriage to Meg Hubbard (Lugene Sanders) but she won't take no for an answer.  She clings, she whines, she wheedles, she pleads, and when that doesn't work, she tries coercion.  Sadly, the top of a derelict lighthouse is not the place to have such a conversation, especially when the railing isn't as substantial as it once was.  Poor misunderstand Vi (Juli Reding), she can't fly and she can't swim.  But she can haunt like no one else.  At first, Tom thinks he's losing his mind.  Then a hitch shows up in the form of a persistent creep (Joe Turkel as Nick) who ferried the offended Vi to the island and he knows she didn't get off of it and he knows she's still not on dry land, hence a little blackmail is in order.  Then he has another witness to deal with...........complications, complications.  What's a pianist to do?

The picture quality is scratchy and old but I don't care because I'm used to poor quality where old films are concerned.  This is all about the dope being nagged to death by a determined ghost.  It's a fun idea, perfect for mocking.  It's sleazy instead of scary.  Carlson tries to play the character in a sympathetic fashion but he's definitely not written that way and considering the last act of violence he contemplates..............  He certainly deserves what he gets.",1443052800,4,1692,4.700680272108843
