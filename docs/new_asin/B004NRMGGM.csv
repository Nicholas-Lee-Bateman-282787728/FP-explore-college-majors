8436780,5,B004NRMGGM,This was a extra viewing for a couple of students working on projects. They got a lot out of it in a short timespan AND a head start on research camera short-cuts and techniques. Especially good were the parts on gadgets and assistance devices and hacks for the camera operator.,1456358400,,278,4.58
8436781,2,B004NRMGGM,"I teach cinematography and am always looking for DVDs and books to use in my program.  I really can't use this DVD. This DVD wasn't at all about cinematography. It's oriented towards young wanna be directors to introduce them to the basics of filmmaking.  It is filled with a lot slam edits and montages of crews which just takes up time, and is all rather poorly shot and poor quality video  - which isn't a good thing for something about cinematography. I understand that its begin the scenes footage, but it should have been color corrected and contrast adjusted.  A part of one interview is totally out of sync, which is just unbelievable. And while a lot of the footage from the actual shoots is good, the interviews are not lit very well.

The DVD starts out extremely  basic, saying such things as you can do a static shot where no one moves and a shot where people move. Well, sorry, that's really not cinematography, just basic filmmaking and a choice of the director. Then it actually plagiarizes the book ""The five Cs of cinematography"" by Mascelli.  I have always had a problem with this book since a lot of it has nothing to do with cinematography - continuity and cutting for example.  It mentions the DP and the camera operator , but ignores the essential positions of the assistant camera and the Gaffer.  It does do a good job of showing the 180 degree rule - which also isn't cinematography but is helpful for a DP to know, and the framing rule of thirds. Then it briefly skips over lighting, which is at least 75% of cinematography. The DPs interviewed mention color temperature without ever explaining it.  If you have a dvd which is so basic for beginners, you can't just mention using a more advanced concept such as color temperature without any explanation. Then it goes to story-boards - again not cinematography. But the DPs do caution the viewer on the problems with storyboards which is good for beginning directors to understand.

A major disappointment. Certainly not usable in any level cinematography course and rather pointless for anyone interested in cinematography. Maybe the title should be ""What beginning directors should know about cinematography""?  But the way its cut and choice of the footage and what is covered in the video, makes this more a recruiting tool for the international film school that made it more so than anything else.",1388793600,9,2378,4.759124087591241
