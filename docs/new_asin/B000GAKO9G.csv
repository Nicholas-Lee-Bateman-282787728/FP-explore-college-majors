8130119,4,B000GAKO9G,This is a replace DVD. I'm hearing and I use this dvd for my pre-schoolers for our Christmas program. I would recommend it.,1385942400,,123,4.391304347826087
8130120,5,B000GAKO9G,"My son LOVES this dvd.  It has 2 ways to watch.  One is with the instructions, a wonderful lady teaching all the signs for the rhymes.  You can also learn new words here because as she talks, she is signing everything.

The second way to watch is with the kids singing.  Both are a great way to learn new sign language but also just good, old fashion fun.  We love singing and signing together.  Timothy can tell us when he wants to sing row, row, row your boat or Twinkle, Twinkle because he knows the signs and learned them from watching this dvd with mom many, many times.  We, as a family, love this dvd.",1182470400,,608,4.226086956521739
8130121,2,B000GAKO9G,"I took the ""We Sign - Playtime"" video out of our local library for my 12 month old daughter to watch (we are just learning to sign).  We both enjoyed it so much that I figured all the videos in the series would be the same.  Not so.  ""We Sign - Rhymes"" is one lady signing different nursery rhymes.  It is dry and not much fun to watch (especially after the first few ones).  It probably is a great educational tool for children a bit older who already know quite a bit of signing.  Perhaps that was what it was meant for.  If you want a really great starter DVD however, go with ""Playtime"".",1179187200,,591,4.131578947368421
