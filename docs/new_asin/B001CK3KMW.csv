8287990,2,B001CK3KMW,"Boring.  A few really good stories & anecdotes, but too much new age platitudes that we've heard and known for years, without telling  ""How?""  to do it.  Anyone into this thinking or practices will find it offers nothing new, with endless video of a guy walking around the California coastal hills for what seems forever.  People new to this might find some of it useful, but it could have been done much shorter, and less tediously.",1509321600,,433,4.644736842105263

8287994,5,B001CK3KMW,This makes and excellent graduation gift. It goes through the steps of finding out who you are and where you want to go. The compass of your heart. It was thought provoking and interesting.,1392595200,,189,4.588235294117647

8287996,5,B001CK3KMW,"I loved the Compass, it was a good read and held my interest. I recevied it quickly, in perfect condition and also ordered the DVD which I have been unable to watch all the way through but like what I have seen so far. This concept is in line with The Secret but done in a unique way. It more closely lined up with the things I believe. Good job!",1268697600,3,346,3.9571428571428573
8287997,2,B001CK3KMW,"Obviously, this film was inspired by the movie ""The Secret"", since not only is the film theme right in line with how The Secret was portrayed, but it also intentionally fills in many of the gaps The Secret didn't cover.  Things such as the importance of persistence, hard work, courage, and so on.  I feel like that if Rhonda Byrne put this DVD together, it would have had some magic to it, but since it was John Spencer Ellis, it just didn't work for me.

Sure, it was informative and inspiring to SOME degree, but in essence, it was just a poorly made ""sort of"" sequel to The Secret.  Many of the same lecturers were present in this film, such as Joe Vitale and John Assaraf (and several others), but the film just failed to capture or move me like The Secret did.

Yes, maybe it's wrong to be drawing comparisons to The Secret, since they're not the same movie, but you can't help it, when The Compass was obviously modeled after The Secret.  To me, it was like a sequel that had a very well written script and a great cast, but the production and direction was poor, leaving a great script wasted.  That's how I feel about the Compass.  Great message, great personalities, but it just didn't deliver the goods.

For inspiration, I'd stick with The Secret, and maybe pick up a Jack Canfield or Brian Tracy book to add to it.",1251849600,13,1327,4.405737704918033
8287998,5,B001CK3KMW,"The Compass spoke to me and helped me understand my journey in life.  Life throws you lots of curves and it's nice to know their are tools out there for you to use.
The Compass did just that for me.  It helped me to realize how precious life and time is.  As we know, time waits for no man.
I would suggest you don't wait to get this and put in your dvd library!",1251763200,5,362,3.864864864864865
8287999,5,B001CK3KMW,"I thought this film did a wonderful job of getting its message across.  It was clear, concise and meaningful.  The message was one of hope and inspiration.  Some films like this do not do a good job of relating the point and/or are unrealistic.  The Compass presents the information in a unique way and the 90 minutes flies by because the film is so well made.  The filmmakers set the bar high.  The film has a very good production quality, as well as outstanding graphics, music and editing.  I enjoyed the diversity of the cast and thought that they had unique thoughts to offer.  I highly recommend this film!",1251763200,9,612,4.5504587155963305
