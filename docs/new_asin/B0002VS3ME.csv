8033398,4,B0002VS3ME,"Scoop is a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois television series from the early 1990s. It stars some currently well-known Canadian actors including Remy Girard (Le D&eacute;clin d'Empire Americain et Les Invasions Barbare) and Roy Dupuis (Nikita et Un Homme et Son P&eacute;ch&eacute;). It's a little strange to see both men so much younger, but at the same time comforting. Scoop looks at the lives of a number of journalists and the stories that they report for a daily newspaper. Each journalist wants the coveted spot on page one above the fold, each one wants to get the story right, but this is not an easy task. In addition there is quite a steamy love affair between two reporters. This is Qu&eacute;b&eacute;c TV so scenes can be more explicit than some viewers maybe used to seeing. Overall, I enjoyed the show, however, I can very much see where Scoop could easily make the transition from evening television drama to evening soap opera. We'll have to see what seasons 2-4 bring.",1095897600,2,978,4.933333333333334
