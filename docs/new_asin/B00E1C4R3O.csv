8599978,4,B00E1C4R3O,"Philip Glass's 2013 opera, ""The Perfect American,"" aprs the novel by Peter Stephan Jungk, was premiered by the Teatro Real. The novel portrays Walt Disney as having a Messianic complex, who is blasphemous, profane, a confirmed racist, a misanthrope with a twisted patriotism, and conquers the world with his feeble-minded ""family entertainment.""

Glass's music is what it is; the opera is theatrically sophisticated but musically simple, though his writing for the voice has become more fluid. Phelim McDermott's production is inadequate, since staging this sort of work in a realistic style (though the computerized projections are slightly interesting) is sowing the seeds of ennui. The cast is fine, as is the conducting of Dennis Russell Davies.",1441411200,,749,5.456896551724138

8599981,4,B00E1C4R3O,"Wonderful portrait of Walt Disney nearing death. Glass at his best in this Spanish production. I doubt the Disney Company approves, but it shows another side of the great man. Learn how Walt changed Ronald Reagan from a Democrat!!",1386547200,2,230,4.923076923076923
8599982,5,B00E1C4R3O,"I knew nothing about the sources of this opera, so I took it at face value.  I must admit I was quite taken aback by the ferocious attack on the main character and the vision of America he represents.
I grew up on Disney (seen Fantasia 14 times).  Bambi and Dumbo were my favorites.  But as I grew up and got to know the man behind the cartoon characters, my relationship both with Disney and his empire went quietly sour.  I do agree with the view presented in this opera: racism, homophobia, misogyny, contempt for the working man . . . all of the hallmarks of advanced capitalism are  part and parcel of the Disney world view.  So I was kind of prepared when, after watching this performance, I went for the reviews.  they all sounded like the reviewer who gave a 1 to this record.  I have a feeling poor Glass  will never see his opera performed in this country (though it should be required viewing for members of Disney's party).
As to the performance, the staging was simply superb, a surreal, fantasmagoric setting quite in harmony with the material.  The singers were extremely good and committed.  The problem, for me, lies with a prosaic libretto that does not allow the public access to a transcendent experience.  Moreover, it drives the score, bogging it down and not permitting the composer any musical flights whatsoever.
All in all, a searing experience, particularly for anyone with a social conscience and a critical view of the so-called ""American Dream"". It is another sign that American opera in the XXIth Century is quite willing to go where angels fear to tread.  A must have.",1385510400,15,1600,4.6512455516014235
8599983,1,B00E1C4R3O,"When we go to the modern gallery of art, and we struggle to understand what it is we are looking at, smarmy hoighties  suggest, in so many words, that it might be because we may have just gotten off the bus from somewhere in Idaho, and just can't fathom the ""genius"" behind it all. We look again at the million dollar painting we KNOW our 5 year old can do.
It works like this: Some people can type 100 words a minute with out a typo...but can they write a novelette as extraordinary as, say, Jose[h Conrad's ""Typhhon"", or ""Youth"" ? No they can't..they are just mechanically adept...NOT literary, or musical at all.
Phillip Glass is one of these who belong in a typing pool in Taipei
Well the entire world is chock a block with mediocre artists, writers and musicans.
I did my best to be objective...I listened as long as I could stand it; try again the next day..and so on, taking me a week to tolerate this auditory torture.  I'm reeasoanbly sure this would be useful regarding ""enhanced interrogation techniques""..I think the Taliban would spill his guts after only 15 minutes of this, SORRY, inexcusable regurgitation of mindless, random singing.

Any one who does like musical meandering, dissonace, no memorable melody..not even any memorable Art Work.nothing at all Disneyesque or even light years away from the expertise Disney's employees accomplished, as well as never forget it music..none of that here. Yes Disney was arrogant, corrupted by money and absolute power..and has no chance of an after life worth living. But do ""genius"" composers like this really feel it necessary to rub our noses in human failing?
Clearly I detest the systematic reductionism of worth and value of any kind in  pieces like this.
Incidentally...I own a number of operas from the Teatro  Real of Madrid...normally, the productions are glorious in every way.",1385164800,10,1848,4.853968253968254
8599984,5,B00E1C4R3O,"I have not read the book, ""The Perfect American"", by Peter Stephan Jungk but I certainly intend to. On some level, and for musical reasons only, I intentionally did not first read the book that alleges that cultural icon Walt Disney was not just human, after all, but a deeply troubled one with a dark and irascible side. The opera certainly begins in attention getting fashion, with Walt in bed, unable to sleep, shouting out randomly while snippets of his sketches get projected onto the back wall.  As the work progresses, the libretto, by Rudy Wurlitzer, does play up the supposed side of Disney as a megalomanic-visionary who sees what America should be (what he wants it to be) and does not go too much into the aspects of his personality that a main character, Dantine, found made Disney very difficult to work for.  I have heard a great deal of the controversy surrounding this opera, mostly from talk radio and web-TV, declaring it an agenda-driven work designed to taint an American cultural icon and thereby devalue what Americans have traditionally stood for (blah-blah-blah.  I won't say where most of this has come from but I will say that one talk show host admitted he had not read the book and called this piece ""a musical.""  My point is only this: until I read the book I can't even develop an opinion on whether Walt Disney was as pure and well-intentioned as we want to believe or was he, actually, yet another psychologically flawed brilliant man with a genius level of vision. If so, he is in good company. So.... do, by all means, go see this opera by Philip Glass for it is truly one of his best works. The music is arresting and nervous at the beginning, dramatic and propulsive throughout and, frequently, beautiful.  This is one of Glass's ""grand operas"" - in scale as well as quality. Musically, this is right up there with ""Satyagraha"" and ""Akhnaten"" and, in my opinion, ""Appomattox"" (especially in the realm of his bio-operas)  As an essential ""American"" study, I place it alongside the works of other composers that explore the dark, human sides of these historical icons and even the country itself (like Adams' ""Nixon in China"" for example) The performances are wonderful, especially Christopher Purves as Disney and Donald Kaasch as Dantine. The staging is stunning and frequently nightmarish. The Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro Del Real de Madrid under long time Glass expert Dennis Russell Davies is brilliant as well. I strongly recommend this as well for being one of Philip Glass' best works. I will now go seek out the book; which may - or may not - change my childhood impression of Walt Disney or his art. No matter what author Jungk has to say, it will not change my opinion on this opera or its visual presentation.  I just got back from an LA performance of Glass's breakthrough early masterpiece, ""Einstein on the Beach"" (which was stunning by the way) and I read a newspaper article in the Times questioning does the LA Opera (being where they are, I guess) ""have the courage to (stage) 'The Perfect American'?""  To which I say: much great art is inspired by or reflective of politics and cultural icons being extolled or revealed. Great music theater of any sort is just that; story aside. So..... why not? and please do!",1384214400,14,3273,4.719789842381786
