5957811,5,B00EZ4DXBU,"This film is an enjoyable, gripping tale of the human struggle and friendship. It should be treated for what it is; an small, indie film that is telling a story, not a documentary. Everyone needs to calm down on being so picky, and take it for what it is; a film.",1388966400,,263,4.176470588235294
5957812,2,B00EZ4DXBU,"This was a disappointing WW1 film: historically inaccurate, technically inaccurate, medically inaccurate, and most unnecessarily inaccurate in its portrayal of trench warfare. Much is made of three British soldiers trapped in No Man's Land after another failed frontal attack on German positions. The slightest noise by the Tommies hiding in a shell crater is enough to draw a storm of light arms fire, yet after the laughably inaccurate gas attack, there's no problem for an entire platoon of Germans (naturally, led by a rigid bullet-headed Prussian) who leave their trenches and go traipsing through the same No Man's Land fully upright in port arms position, wearing gas masks... No consistency.

Of course, the Platoon Commander for the the Brits in their sector has to be a silly clich, a pompous, aristocratic Oxbridge type who has no concern at all for his men. The platoon sergeant is equally clich, in that he (in contrast to the vacuous Lieutenant) is salt-of-the-earth, and a hero to his men... The other characters are predictably predictable as well.

I was also astounded to see a British soldier, who figures prominently in the drama, managing to get by on pluck, a bit of rum, and a lot of stiff upper lip when his leg is blown off by German artillery. Rather than succumb to shock, or blood loss, he pluckily binds up his stump with a tourniquet fashioned from his musette bag and webbing, and tally-hoes his way almost back to the British lines with a platoon of German infantrymen chasing after him across the mud, shell craters, and barbed wire.

The story had possibilities, but was obviously rushed to script and screen. The flagrant errors are simply the product of slap-dash historical research - a failing that is difficult to understand, given the extensive materials available.

Sad to see such interesting potential given a less-than-adequate treatment.",1388188800,68,1882,5.041800643086817
5957813,2,B00EZ4DXBU,abortion scene completely off base with procedure being preformed with some sort of gaff hook?  really?  not sure how much money they spent on this film but perhaps a few dollars spent on understanding actual medical procedures would have been well spent.  overall this movie would have been a worthy attempt had the producers actually done any period research.  what a waste.,1387843200,,376,5.016129032258065
5957814,3,B00EZ4DXBU,I thought the production values were good. The editing was good. The portrayal of trench warfare was adequate What was interesting was the parallel stories between the men in the trenches and the women at home was interesting.,1387756800,2,226,4.973684210526316
5957815,5,B00EZ4DXBU,"Was expecting a cheap action movie and got an emotional drama/thriller, but it works. Turns out it is more about the personal lives of a few soldiers and how they and their families deal with the war and how it shapes them as people. There's still a lot of action and excitement, but it's mostly about three soldiers trapped together and how they work to survive. It also deals with the character's wives back home and how they adjusted to life without their spouses. It jumps between all these characters and can be a bit jarring at first, but at the end all the stories tie together in a way you probably won't expect. There's an emotional ending that will definitely affect you and makes this a worthwhile watch. Not what I expected, but very good anyway. Would give 4.5/5 if I could.",1387411200,,787,4.510489510489511
5957816,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"Dear Mr. Director (also Mr. Producer and Lead Actor),

Can I please get my hour and thirty seven minutes back? Bad writing, wooden acting, cliche plot with the oh-so shocking abortion sub plot thrown in, and absolutely no understanding of the Great War or military history whatsoever. What a complete waste of time.

And by the way, no matter what army - corporals don't rate someone calling them ""Sir."" Crack a history book some time. Or better yet, a book on film making. You might learn something.",1387238400,21,500,4.735632183908046

A cautionary lesson in how not to try and do your best to be a man, but to ""be there"" for your ugly, thin-lipped almost unbelievably self-serving, other-sacrificing wife, lest she go riding strange ponies before your side of the bed's cold when you've gone to report for duty.",1490054400,,516,4.942528735632184

5957823,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"Spoiler Alert
The only reason I can see for this film's existence, is as a really long drawn out ""Planned Parenthood"" commercial.

5957874,4,B00EZ4DXBU,"I am surprised about some of the low rated reviews nit-picking about historical accuracy in this movie. From my exposure to WWI history (mainly what I learned in school, in conjunction with The Great War - YouTube Channel), this depiction of trench warfare was passable. The movie did a good job telling a historical-fiction story about several British soldiers stuck in no-mans land, trying to make their way back to friendly lines, and ultimately home to their loved-ones. The movie in my opinion did a good job depicting the era, focusing around the horrors of what at the time was revolutionary methods of  brutal and bloody modern warfare.

The story takes place over the period of one attack, is largely shot at night, and they do show an often overlooked bit of home front tragedy.

5957986,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"The director says this is a human drama and not a World War I war film. Fine, but that doesn't excuse one from getting it right. I knew this movie was going south early when we first meet the protagonist's lieutenant-- a stuffy fop who callously orders his men to charge machine guns while he remains safely behind in his dugout. The fact is that most officers shared the risks of their soldiers and died in droves alongside their men. Later we see the lieutenant order a sniper to gun down his own man. This is ludicrous, criminal, and a certain morale-killer for the unit. Everyone on both sides knew there was constant activity in no man's land and even had an unspoken agreement that the other side would be permitted to recover their wounded unmolested. Instead we get ""The Hun"". You would think after movies like Das Boot we could dispense with Germans being portrayed as cardboard monsters.  Let me recommend Ernst Jnger's book, Storm of Steel, as an antidote.

Then there's the abortion story. The director charges audiences to have an open mind, but I'd bet that even a staunch supporter of abortion would have difficulty generating sympathy for the women involved here.

5958044,2,B00EZ4DXBU,"The war scenes were alright. There were some issues, such as the German gas attack which was pretty pitiful. If all gas attacks were like the one in this film then gas would have only been a minor nuisance. There are some war movie cliches, such as the pompous jackass of an officer, and the fact that the Germans have scars on their faces to make them look mean. The cheesiest of all is the trap that the British set for the Germans.

The protagonist informs the other two survivors that at a certain time the German trench (and all of no man's land too, apparently) will be hammered by artillery. This is the reason that the three survivors are rushing against the clock to get back to their lines. But just in case this heavy artillery bombardment doesn't work, we later learn that the British have set a trap.

The entire front line trench has been rigged with high explosives and the British have pulled back. The British WANT the Germans to attack, capture the trench and then be blown up. Okay, so what is the purpose of the massive artillery bombardment if the British actually wanted the lure the Germans out and into their trap? A massive artillery attack would only succeed in keeping the Germans pinned down in their own trenches, hiding in their dugouts.

Of course this ingenious plan is foiled when one of the characters runs through no man's land in order to stop the impending artillery attack. He makes it through no man's land without being shot by the Germans (and the British too), but then snags his foot on a trip wire, falls into the recently abandoned front line trench and is promptly blown to the moon. Pompous jackass officer does not approve.

There were a few other things I found to be cheesy, but overall I could overlook this sort of thing. This is a movie about World War I, which sadly their aren't enough of in my opinion, so I'm pretty forgiving. However, the unfaithful wife subplot completely ruined this movie for me. Throughout the movie the protagonist misses his wife and often looks at her photo. I suspect that the thought of returning home to her is what keeps the man going.

However, the wife is a floozy that was screwing around while her husband was away at war. She got pregnant and tries to hide her infidelity by having an abortion. A doctor wouldn't do it, so the wife guilt trips a nurse into doing it for her. The ""back alley"" coat hanger abortion doesn't go as planned and the wife bleeds to death. If that isn't bad enough, then comes the ridiculous plot twist.

The protagonist's friend - one of the three men trying to get back to the British line before the artillery bombardment - eventually bleeds to death. He had gotten his leg blown off earlier that day during the attack against the German lines. The friend's dying wish is for the protagonist to deliver a letter to his girlfriend back home. Oddly enough, his girlfriend just so happens to be the nurse that was guilt tripped into giving the abortion. An unbelievable coincidence. After coming home from the war, the protagonist finds the woman in jail (because she killed his wife) and delivers the letter.

If the film makers goal was to make the viewer feel bad for the protagonist, then I guess it worked. The poor guy goes through hell, then comes home to learn that his wife was a bimbo and is now dead after a botched abortion that was supposed to hide her infidelity from him. Additionally, in order to carry out the wish of his dead friend, the protagonist has to go visit the woman that killed his wife.

If the goal was to make the viewer despise the protagonist's wife, then that worked as well. Unfortunately, the wife subplot and the cheesy nurse plot twist ruined the entire film in my opinion. I'd have given this film four stars, even with all the flaws and war movie cliches, if everything about the wife had been edited out.",1419724800,,3861,4.529411764705882

There is a lot of action in the trenches. That part is great and well done. the British really need to give positive endings to there war movies. I would have given it 5 stars except fpr the female home front part of the movie. Which is just about 10 or 15 minutes of the overall movie. It really not needed.

5958054,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"Sick & Stupid Score: 8/7*

This could have been a very simple and elegant war story of camaraderie and heroism.  Instead, the movie indulges itself in a sickening sub-story of an unfaithful wife and a botched abortion.

This hideous abortion digression is supposed to supply one of two sides of a metaphor:  On the one side, we have women trying to destroy a life, on the other side, men trying to save a life.  So much for a failed attempt at raising this story to the level of cinematic art.

If you are looking for a straight-up story of World War I and the World War I generation, forget watching this movie.  The traditional romantic tension of soldiers at the front longing to be with their girlfriends and wives back home, or of faithful women waiting for their heroic lovers to return, does not exist in this movie.  That theme has been supplanted by adultery, pregnancy, and a gory basement abortion, as opposed to the standard back-alley abortion of feminist mythology.

The synopsis for this movie is a lie.  Avoid this very sick and stupid movie.

5958055,3,B00EZ4DXBU,"There are better WWI movies out there if you're looking:  Beneath Hill 60, Gallipoli, even Paaschendale.  I'm not sure what the point of this one was.  The military side of the house was spot on - good combat footage, weapons, uniforms, and depiction of trench warfare.  But you had this absurd premise of a senior NCO dragging one of his Corporals out of No-Man's-Land with a traumatically amputated leg, only to have him die when they get back to the trench.  And then back in England the NCO's unfaithful wife undergoes a hideous, basement abortion done by a mere nurse who is the (gorgeous!!) widow of the Corporal!  I'm not sure what kind of parallel they were trying to draw here but it went in a strange direction that I didn't expect.  You decide.",1390953600,5,755,4.58955223880597

8610586,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"This is what happens when the politically correct crowd decide to make a movie.  Historically, inacurate and downright fanciful when it comes to how war is conducted and conditions on the battlefield.  In fact the only thing correct was the mud.  They did seem to think that it would be authentic if in addition to the mud they added Germans speaking Germans and bad lighting.  The fact that the British sometimes sounded more American than an American probably went unnoticed in light of everything else that was so poorly done.

The plot is so predictable and touches almost every progressive dream (probably why they allowed the mud). The juxtaposition of the noble woman facing her backstreet abortion while the men face the futility of their battle against morality of the war, ""shoot him""; British officer, ""I'm Irish"", noble Private. Bam.  The idealistic notion is that you will reach the conclusion that the woman has fought her own heroic battle against the injustice of not being able to demand an abortion versus the men trapped in the sausage factory trying to get out alive.  ""Shoot him"", cries the audience; ""I'm the writer"", Bam.",1494633600,,1144,4.927083333333333

8610590,1,B00EZ4DXBU,"If you surfed here to watch a war movie, then you may want to read this.  The movie is mislabeled and the description is inaccurate.  This movie is really a drama set in the stage of WWI.  It is about two men trying to survive in no man's land between the British and German fronts, and it is about their two women back home struggling over a pregnancy.  It switches back and forth between the men and the women.  There is very little fighting and nothing is accomplished military wise.  I won't include any real spoilers in case you want to watch it anyway, but if you, like me, can watch even a B-rated war movie, this isn't it.  I would keep looking if I were you.
