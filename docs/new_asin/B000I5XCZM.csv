The impact that the Wedemeyers made on the lives of others is amazing.
(If we could forget our problems and focus on what God would have us to do,
what difference that makes!)

We had seen ""Quiet Victory"" ~ this is a follow-up to that ..... and well worth the time
to watch it!",1377993600,,317,4.19672131147541
