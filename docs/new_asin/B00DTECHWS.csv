5854715,4,B00DTECHWS,"I've been hoping for a long time to see this highly entertaining collection of movie trailers, highlights, gaffs, and outtakes finally make its long overdue appearance on DVD.  Just watching the content itself is a total hoot and a load of fun, but to have it all presented and hosted by TV Horror Host Legend John Zacherle (Zacherley, aka Roland, aka The Cool Ghoul), makes this DVD an absolute must-own for horror movie fans and ""monster kids"" like myself.

I bought a VHS copy of Horrible Horror when it first came out back around 1986 or 1987, and have watched it so many times over the years that it is practically worn out.  Not to mention the fact that my last VHS player died a couple of years ago, and I've been unable to view it since.  When the pre-order for this new Special Edition was announced a few months back, I think I must have been one of the first to place my order with Amazon.  Since then, I found out a few more details about this release, and became even more excited.  Added footage and additional Zach bits were to extend the original's running time from 110 minutes to ""almost three hours"" as it states on the back of the DVD case.  In fact, the Special Edition clocks in at two hours forty four minutes.  But that's still an additional 54 minutes of well-aged cheese.  The original VHS case says scenes from over 50 vintage films, whereas the new DVD case mentions scenes from over 75 films.  I didn't actually take the time to count them, but there is surely a great deal of new footage, and some hilarious never before seen bits where Zach has inserted himself into the movie clips.  All of this makes this Special Edition essential viewing.  The image quality of the DVD is quite adequate, though not remarkably better than my old VHS tape, so I have to wonder if any remastering was actually done.  But given the nature and the content of the disc, this did not tend to bother me at all.

They could have easily left it at that, and I would have been one happy Zach fan.  But the makers of this DVD wanted to give us even more, so they included a second disc of bonus features!  Unfortunately, the bonus disc doesn't add a great deal to this DVD set.  There are two short bits of genuine interest - ""Zacherley Preps on Set"", a 3 minute 35 second (3:35) glimpse behind the scenes of Horrible Horror, with Zach getting himself psyched up to go on camera, briefly plotting out his approach to the host segments, and joking around with the(unseen)crew.  You get the distinct impression that everyone involved had a great time doing it.  The other extra of interest to Zach fans is his 1960 appearance on the TV show ""What's My Line"", sans his trademark makeup.  This bit runs about 2:50, and while entertaining, it was something I'd seen previously on YouTube.  However, after these two all-too-brief Zach bits, the rest of the bonus disc is simply filler.  We get a nearly 30 minute ""Lights Out"" TV episode from 1951 (no Zach), which was fairly boring and predictable to sit through.  About the only point of interest I found was one of the actors in it looked like a cross between Fred MacMurray and Hugo Weaving.  That, and the fact that the show's sponsor, Admiral, was touting its 11 cubic foot refrigerator, as well as its ""big screen"" 20 inch television(!).  After that, we get a 5:45 Gumby short called ""The Glob"" (sorry, but I've never been much of a Gumby fan).  Finally, we get a ""bonus"" movie feature, a pretty decent full frame presentation of 1958's ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" (85 min).  This would have been totally awesome if it had been a version that Zacherley had hosted at some point in his career, but alas, this was not the case.  Even if it had been one of the many movies Zach had poked fun at in Horrible Horror, the tie-in would have been a bit less tenuous.  So while it's indeed a funny and entertaining filler piece, it again had nothing to do with Zach or Horrible Horror whatsoever.  Perhaps if I didn't already own it on DVD, I would be more appreciative of it being included in this 2-disc set, because it IS a campy, low-budget 50's horror flick.

So all in all, a slightly mixed bag, but the simple fact that we get an extended cut of Horrible Horror on this DVD set's first disc merits five stars all by itself.  But I'm afraid they missed the overall mark with the bonus disc, and for that I have to deduct a star.  With all of the great Zacherley footage still out there, they shouldn't tantalize us with extras, and then not deliver something worthy of inclusion.  I couldn't help but feel the bonus disc was a wee bit of a cheat.  I know it sounds funny to say, but if they had simply released the extended cut of Horrible Horror in a single disc edition, I would have probably given it 5 stars all the way.  A good example of less being more, IMO.",1379116800,36,4817,4.440273037542662
5854716,3,B00DTECHWS,Its great seeing a hour of more footage on the first disc but the second disc is a complete waste the thing worth while is a 2 minute clip of whats my line in which i seen on youtube.,1432857600,,183,3.717948717948718
5854717,5,B00DTECHWS,"This is probably more for the fan than the casual user, however if you're reading this review you're probably a fan.  Composed of new footage of Z, hamming it up in the lab, and intro-ing clumps of B movie trailers, which are hilarious. Tons of material- more that you're likely to watch in one go. Overall quality is B movie, which is appropriate, Good background for your Halloween party, or whenever you get that creature-double-feature itch. Buy popcorn too.",1432684800,2,462,4.848101265822785

5854719,4,B00DTECHWS,"I first got to know the Cool Ghoul, the incomparable Zacherley, from the VHS version of ""Horrible Horror."" I played that tape until it wore out, and never really
 expected to see a DVD release. Here it is, though, and it's great.
  If I'm perfectly frank about it, all the old horror clips and trailers aren't as appealing as they once were. YouTube and cheap, public domain horror DVD's have made weird, old, lovably bad movies much easier to view and own. But they're not really the point, anyway.
  The main attraction here is Zacherley, and he's a blast. He seems to be having a ball, torturing jell-o amoebas and zapping wind-up toys with abandon. He seems to get a little weary as the proceedings lurch into the third hour, and you probably will be, too.  All the added footage makes things drag a bit, and throws off the rhythm of the film. It's okay material, but not really neccesary. There's a full second disc of extras, but only a brief clip of Zach getting prepped for his scenes is particularly interesting.
  Quibbles aside, this collection is a nostalgiac treat, a must for all Zacherley fans, and, after all these years, still ""the ultimate party tape!""",1426464000,,1170,4.645631067961165

5854736,5,B00DTECHWS,"The shorts are all very good and Zacherley the host is tolerable. The best part of this dvd is the that on disc two, there is a Gumby short and one of the best copies  of ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" that has ever been redone out there. The picture is so clear you can see the small xmas tree like bulbs burning on each shoulder of the female monster. The rockin' combo playing in the backyard is great too. The ""block of wood with sideburns"" ( John Ashley), is such a ""oh I am so cool"" jerk, you just love watching him make an ass of himself. The constant jabbing at Carter by Doctor Frank is fun as well.",1399420800,2,603,4.153846153846154
5854737,5,B00DTECHWS,"Gave this one to my father for his birthday--major Bela Lagosi fan, and the trailers are fun to watch!! To see these old classics reminds us where Hollywood really started and Bela Lagosi is part of that special Hollywood history-a great one for your sci fi collection!",1395100800,2,269,4.74468085106383
5854738,5,B00DTECHWS,"After watching the ""Horrible Horror"" Special Edition, I tried to think of the ultimate movie clip encapsulating Zacherley's career. After pondering that long and hard I figured it had to be Bela Lugosi blurting ""Pull the string!"" from the Ed Wood masterwork ""Glen or Glenda."" Regardless of the material, Zacherley, ""The Cool Ghoul"" (John Zacherle) gets treated great by Producer Sandy Oliveri in this lovingly assembled collection of clips spanning Zacherley's television career which was put together in a way that's enchantingly low budget, matching the subject matter.

The set comprises two DVD's, the first of which is far more significant as it contains clips from over 75 famous (or infamous) B-movies that won't fail to impress and delight fans of laughably bad cinema and Zacherley's oddball brand of ghoulish humor. Appropriately, the disc opens with Lugosi chewing the scenery and only improves from there. Although I never saw a Zacherley episode live, what stood out for me was how similar my tastes and experiences were to his in the B-movie department: of all the movies excerpted here there are only two I have not seen (!), although there were a couple of obscure TV shows and shorts I had missed as well. (If you're wondering the two movies I missed are ""Face of the Screaming Werewolf"" and ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" both of which look positively awful.) Scattered in amongst bad movie stalwarts like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Robot Monster"" are more obscure titles, which I always seek out as hidden treasure. In the race to the bottom, nothing can top the clip from ""Hollywood on Parade,"" a silly short with Bela Lugosi that features the most annoying musical production I've ever seen (I include ""Annie"" in that statement.) The bottom line is that disc one is a treasure trove for B-movie fans, and could even serve as a shopping list for the truly dedicated bad movie aficionado.

Disc two is a bonus disc, but tends to be thematically a mess. My favorite segment was ""Zacherley on 'What's My Line?'"" in which the star doffs his makeup and proves a great sport for the panel. ""Zacherley Preps On Set"" is a standard behind the scenes affair that is interesting for one time viewing but won't be revisited often. I was amused by the presence of the Gumby short ""The Glob"" which somewhat parallels then-current B-movies thematically (the Glob only wants ice cream...,) while I was confused by the presence of ""Frankenstein's Daughter,"" a 1958 low budget horror film starring the always reliable John Ashley. I had seen ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" before, but rewatched it again as this copy is better than the other prints I had seen. I was confused because other than the general theme of funny B-movie camp to enjoy, I couldn't really find a connection to Zacherley (though no doubt he would approve!)

I debated on whether this set should get four or five stars, and finally settled on five. I did find disc two to be a hodgepodge of occasionally questionable relevance, but in the end decided that the hilarity and content of disc one was amusing enough to offset the muddled nature of disc two. Fans of Zacherley, creature features, or B-movies in general will love this set. After you watch it I'll bet you find some lost classics you need track down for your cheesy viewing pleasure. As for me, I suddenly feel an urgent need to rewatch ""The Giant Claw"" or anything by Ed Wood.",1395100800,11,3420,4.842735042735042
5854739,5,B00DTECHWS,"youll love this.a later day zacherle still doing his thing and some cool extras, the classic footage of bela lugosi is priceless",1392681600,,128,4.863636363636363
5854740,1,B00DTECHWS,"I didn't realise that this is a compendium of some silly TV show. The host is essentially an idiot, neither funny, nor scary, and the film clips are all old promos.",1391385600,2,164,4.32258064516129
5854741,2,B00DTECHWS,"its mostly bits and pieces of his show very little of the movies.
I had hoped it would be more like the Elvira shows that had complete films with it not just clips of films.",1390521600,,173,3.9714285714285715
5854742,5,B00DTECHWS,"This is one of those rare releases which has movie trailers as it's main feature and a feature length film as a bonus. Being intimate with most of the movies featured in the trailers, I can say seeing them being pushed in the trailers is flat out hilarious in its own right. The title of this release is correct, 'Horrible Horror.' Trailers for Killer Shrews, Giant Gila Monster, War of the Colossal Beast, Attack of the Puppet People, most Lon Chaney Jr movies, a few from Ed Wood all trying to convince movie goers to see these things in the theaters and drive-ins. Add in outtakes from Abbott and Costello movies, interview segments with Bela Lugosi, and various cinematic shorts and you have a great collection.

The collection is of course tied together beautifully by one of the pioneering TV horror movie hosts, Zacherley. Zacherley hosted horror movies mainly in the New York and Philadelphia markets way back in the 50's and on this DVD, you see an old master doing something that must have come naturally for him after so many years of experience. As a bonus feature you see a little footage of Zacherley prepping for the introduction segment of the program. Also check for Zacherley making a few appearances in the trailers themselves.

Speaking of bonus features, you get a real feature, It's a great print of Frankenstein's Daughter starring the long time B movie horror star (and later a producer of movies most notably Apocalypse Now) John Ashley. Other bonuses are a Gumby short, a weird early TV program (back when the shows were recorded live on camera) and Zacherley guesting on What's My Line (without  makeup!)  in 1960.

Well worth the price of admission.",1389830400,5,1677,4.788927335640138
5854743,5,B00DTECHWS,"Growing up, two figures gave life and breath to my whacky childhood: Ray Harryhausen and Zach. John Zacherle brought ""Roland"" from Philly to NY in style. I remember the newspaper ads featuring half his face, counting down the days. He certainly lived up to the press, this incredibly funny and witty man with a Transylvania brogue (sounded more like County Cork to me), a wife in a coffin, a pal in a burlap sack, and dissections of cauliflower brains and New Jersey Amoebas. Last I heard, the man is 94 and still up to his old mischief, bless him endlessly. This is loads of trailers, films of various quality, with bits of Zach himself interspersed to my delight, amusement and nostalgia. There's no one quite like Zacherley.",1389398400,5,727,4.732283464566929
5854744,5,B00DTECHWS,This was a great find!! My boyfriend is a huge fan of Zacherley and this DVD includes a bunch of great shorts/trailers hosted by him. I was afraid it would be a cheap bunch of clips thrown together but it's a great and fun DVD!,1388361600,2,227,4.066666666666666
5854745,5,B00DTECHWS,"BOTTOM LINE: This is still great fun to watch and safe for every member of the family. It never fails to bring back a lot of warm memories. I also credit this video for my lifelong interest in classic sci-fi & the Z-grade clunkers of yesteryear. HORRIBLE HORROR set me on the path to collecting & appreciating the great (and not so great) films from days long gone. Thanks, Zacherley for all the wonderfully moldy memories! 5 STARS!

THE STORY: When the 500-year lease is up on his crumbing castle by the sea, 1960's-era horror movie host ""Zacherley"" and his (always unseen) assistant Igor must pack up hundred's of year's worth of junk - including an amassed collection of movie trailers, shorts & bloopers from dozens of low budget 1950's-60's horror & sci-fi films. Zacherley has Igor cue up the dusty old film reels and invites us to sit back and watch them along with him.

THOUGHTS: I bought the original Goodtimes VHS of this silly concoction waaay back in 1986 at an old Woolworth's store, during my early college years. I think I still have that tape sitting in a box of stuff somewhere. Anyhow... I eventually stopped playing the tape for fear that the next time I put it into my VCR it would get eaten up! I can now lay those fears to rest, thanks to this marvelous re-issue of HORRIBLE HORROR: THE SPECIAL EDITION onto digital DVD!

THE DVD: Video & audio quality of the various clips ranges from solid to jumpy & grainy. In all fairness though, the source materials for this Goodtimes release were likely of the crummy public domain variety, so it is what it is. But that in no way deters from the fun of watching these goofy old clips. There are a few differences from the original videotape version but nothing too drastic. More importantly, there's quite a bit of extra stuff, (extended/alternate Zacherley segments & several additional film trailers) on this DVD version that makes upgrading from your old tape an even better bargain!",1388016000,5,1951,4.665697674418604

5854747,4,B00DTECHWS,"What I'll try to do with this review is to describe with some clarity exactly what this 2 DVD ""Horrible Horror"" release is all about to the uninitiated. Here goes! Disc One is hosted by Zach, and for those like me who did not grow up within his TV viewing area, and only heard of him, or perhaps saw his images in Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine,  this is a great way to meet and greet the ""Cool Ghoul"". He is every bit as great as advertised. His hosting here is in color, and filmed circa 1986. In between his segments, there are extended (nearly all black and white) trailers, clips and bits from all of the usual suspects: Ed Wood's catalog, ""Robot Monster"", ""The Giant Claw"", Lugosi, zombies, the rare, the hilarious, the bizarre, Lon Chaney, Jr., robots, and more. The most splendid for me are the oh so rare! About six outtakes from ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"", former Dead End Kid and Bowery Boy Gabriel Dell as Drac on the old Steve Allen Show (extremely notable! Years later, Gabe would be the voice on that ""Famous Monsters Speak"" LP so widely pictured in Famous Monsters magazine, plus his mates the East Side Kids are also included in clips on this DVD, being spooked by Bela Lugosi) , Lugosi here in a vintage TV ""You Asked For It"" clip, in Dracula garb, and the primo Abbott and Costello ""Colgate Comedy Hour"" clip featuring the Creature From The Black Lagoon. Too Cool! Zacherley has a special rarity clip. He sings with guitar on an old Pat Boone show. Not a bad singing voice, Mr. Zach! For those who like such items, Zach is superimposed in several drop-in scenes. I always prefer the films untampered by sound and visual effects by horror hosts, but it's not a biggie either way here. These drop-ins are few and far between in this collection. All in all Disc one is a collector's dream. I only wish there were more vintage original Zacherley moments from the golden age. On to Disc 2: Other reviewers have hit the coffin nail right on the head here. Very little rhyme or reason to the contents. The best bit is Zacherley, sans makeup, on a ""Halloween"" telecast of ""What's My Line?"", as a mystery guest. Awesome. Then there's Zach on the 1986 set of this in-color hosting of ""Horrible Horror"", basically doing a walk-through prior to filming. Interesting, but not spectacular.  The other three items are off the wall, indeed!  A ""Lights Out"" teleplay in black and white (the whole show!) from 1950 or so. (Oddly, neither Zacherley nor any other horror star is in the cast. Nor is the plot really horror-ish!) The commercials for sponsor Admiral TV and appliances are the most notable part of this strange inclusion. If you like Gumby and Pokey, you'll enjoy them being chased around by a blob of clay. Crazy stuff, and very trippy. Makes more sense for Disc 2 than ""Lights Out"" at least!  Tailor-made for ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"". Finally, there's the complete ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" movie. One of 1958's stranger entries, and has got to be one of John Ashley's first appearances. The picture and sound for this film are top-notch. As a side-bar, and perhaps emblematic of Disc 2 assembly haste, Zacherley's name is spelled incorrectly on the menu. Oops. I guess you can't have everything, but Disc 2 pines for about an hour of original Zacherley TV clips. Oh, well. In conclusion, for fans of  classic and hilarious horror, this set is a party with Zacherley at his castle not to be missed. Huge kudos to Legend Films for their usual top-notch work and for best-possible picture and sound. Their love of the genre and its fans comes through loud and clear. Thanks to them for releasing such fun stuff. Sit back and enjoy! And, in the words of Zacherley, "" Good night, whatever you are!""",1385510400,4,3724,4.6534954407294835
5854748,5,B00DTECHWS,"A very well done sci-if trailer series.  A lot of fun!  We all know, but hate to admit, that sometimes the trailers were better than the movies themselves.

5854755,5,B00DTECHWS,"""THE ULTIMATE PARTY TAPE"" has now become ""THE ULTIMATE PARTY DVD"", an excellent 2013 SPECIAL EDITION release of the 1986 VHS classic, HORRIBLE HORROR.

Quality wise, just about all the scenes in the Zacherley segments have been re-mastered off the original elements and even include a few extra and alternate takes not in the original GOODTIMES version...Much of the film footage was re-mastered, some from better prints than previously used...Of course, there are the expected variations in quality, since both 16mm and 35mm prints have been utilized (as well as even a few kinescopes), but EVERYTHING looks outstanding and much better and sharper than the old VHS release.

MORE MOVIES...MORE TRAILERS...MORE ZACHERLEY!...Don't miss Zach's battle with the Apeman and his appearance in the Plan 9 trailer among many other terrific ""cut ins"" not in the original version...AND...You don't have to even like Zacherley to be entertained by this wonderful compilation. This is the finest ever collection of the BEST OF THE WORST IN HORROR AND SCI-FI...The cover says 75 movie highlights, but there is way more than that!...We are talkin' about 2 hours and 45 minutes worth of cool stuff!

8597541,4,B00DTECHWS,Get ready for lowlights and special defects from some of the worst motion pictures ever produced.  John Zacherle was a radio and TV personality who hosted late night horror movies broadcast out of Philadelphia and New York City under the name 'Zacherley.'  I obtained my first copy of Horrible Horrors on VHS back in the eighties and I enjoyed every minute of it.  In this compilation Zacherley provides clips from some really bad movies mainly from the fifties and very early sixties.  Its really hard to believe that this stuff was actually projected onto theatre screens.,1447977600,,574,4.947916666666667
8597542,5,B00DTECHWS,"This  is a collection of flip clips, promos and trailers for more than 70 cheesy horror movies, as well as scenes from movie shorts and serials  of the 1940s, clips from a few very low budget science fiction shows such as Flash Gordon, and even segments from TV shows such as ""You Asked for It"" featuring Bela Lugosi. If you are a fan of TV and movie esoteric cheese, this is a goldmine (fool's gold) of stuff you won't find gathered in one DVD in any other collection, as far as I am aware.  Plus, there are outtakes from ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" the only really good movie in the bunch. Zacherley, the host, was one of the first to show bad movies and comment on them, and his shows such as ""Chiller Theater"" and ""Shock Theater"" were the inspiration, IMO, for Mystery Science Theater. You also get a second disc for the same low price, featuring the Z budget ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" uncut and in nice shape, a Gumby ""Blob"" short, ""Lights Out"" TV horror show and more. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that someone should have included a complete listing, either in the order the clips are presented or in Alphabetical order. Still, you get more than five hours of ""schlock theater"" for a very low price.",1443312000,,1232,4.515695067264574
