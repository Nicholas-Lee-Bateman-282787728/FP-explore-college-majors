2599144,5,B000G1R3A8,"Will & Grace to me is one of the best tv shows ever!!! It touches a lot of emotions that friends share, be it gay, straight or otherwise. I also feel it was one of the best written shows as well. Each of the four characters play a huge role in each episode and in their own way are all the stars, not just the main two. I now have all eight seasons and find I can watch them repeatedly.",1388707200,,386,3.8375

Jack, Will and Grace could all be over the top and a bit to ""stock"" in their characterizations of themselves to a point where they become slightly cartoon-like and parodies of themselves.

They make good party gifts and if one has a group over and viewing the series are a part of the event, then there's nothing better for a night or two of laughs.",1386547200,,502,4.617977528089888

I bought a season of Will and Grace from him and asked for a refund because I did not want the foreign copy of Will and Grace which I received. This seller would not give me a refund and assured me that the DVDs worked in his DVD player here in the United States so I should have no problem playing them. I have since tried them on numerous DVD players and they are completely useless. The DVDs do not work in US DVD players and I am extremely upset and angry!! I will never buy from this seller again and either should you!,1308182400,,563,4.081081081081081

2599183,4,B000G1R3A8,"If you didn't feel the magic disappear at the start of season 4 you'll really FEEL IT NOW! Will & Grace was always a great show from the beginning and pure magic from seasons 1 - 3. But when season 4 started with Woody Harrelson as Grace's love interest the chemistry and magic between all the lead characters seemed to disappear over night. Will & Grace never really had the FUNNY CRAZY lines but they worked well with what they were given. Instead all the good lines were given to Jack & Karen. Pretty much in my opinion for the shows 8 year run it's always secretly been called the Jack & Karen show. Anyways at this point since Will & Grace weren't even given any decent lines, the below average lines that were given they had to turn humorous which just came off really desperate and made the 2 characters even more annoying then they originally were. With season 5 Grace gets married and well....the show just doesn't have any element to keep you tuning in each week. Every episode of this season is almost a pain to watch. You try and look forward to the next laugh and all you get are bad jokes with bad a delivery from the actors and a lot of empty spaces in-between when waiting for the next joke. Every episode you could already tell this show was on its last legs. It wasn't about making people laugh anymore. It was more about learning a life lesson at the end of each episode. When a show starts to become learning about Life Lessons that's when it becomes like the Family Matters sitcom and SLOW torture. I was in shock that this show went on for 8 years. When the show 1st started and after an amazing season 3 I always thought this show would last longer then the over rated Friends sitcom. But after season 4 it was time to hang up the hat and call it a day. Despite that my review maybe coming off negative i do like all of the 4 main actors and this is Will & Grace so i rated it with a 4 star even though i wanted it to be 3 1/2. But because its Will & Grace i still give it a chance.",1202688000,4,2005,4.170103092783505

2599185,4,B000G1R3A8,"Once again, another installment of the Will and Grace Series.  It's great to have the 5th season on DVD but I wish there were more extras.  Cast interviews or more deleted scenes would be great.  It seems more and more studios are quick to release series out there with out expanding on the extras.  Enough with the quick buck guys, hardcore fans such as myself live for this stuff.  Still it is great to finally have them just being released since England has had them for about a year ... all 8 SEASONS!  Gee, thanks Warner Brothers!",1199664000,,535,4.463917525773196

The bloopers are hilarious, but $40 for 10 minutes worth of laughs?  Crazy!  It's one thing to release a crappy guilty pleasure like Mama's Family cut up, but when you release a high quality, wonderful, brilliant show like Will & Grace and don't even have the whole episode, it is just ridiculous!

This is the same edited-for-more-commercials version that plays in syndication! The synopsis on the package even declares that ""Singer Deborah Harry...guest stars as herself in the episode"", yet her scene and others are not to be found.  Fortunately, not all episodes receive this shoddy treatment: at least one episode has been restored to its original Supersized (NBC ""sweeps"" gimmick) length (original air time was 40 minutes with commercials).

Also, considering the glacial pace of releasing each season, these DVDs really should be a) the complete orginal content that aired on NBC, and b) a lot more ""loaded with extra features"" as the box cover boasts.  After all, every single episode of 'The Simpsons' gets a full commentary on the DVD.

2599221,1,B000G1R3A8,"As Will & Grace fans, we've been slighted time and time again with regard to DVD releases, whether from lack of special features, from slow release schedules, or from problems with actual DVDs. It was bad enough that Lion's Gate botched the releases for seasons 2 and 3, but now they've done all of us W&G fans a tremendous injustice by giving us syndicated versions of episodes of our beloved, recently-departed show.

That's right, the six episodes from season 5 that are what NBC liked to call ""super size"" episodes (Boardroom and a Parked Place: 40-min, Women and Children First: 40-min, Dolls and Dolls: 40-min, May Divorce Be With You: 35-min, 23: 40-min, 24: 45-min) appear on this DVD set as the syndicated, or ""cut"", versions! When a normal-length episode is cut for syndication, it's not fantastic, but it's also not of too much consequence because not a lot of footage is removed; however, when an episode is extended to begin with and it is cut for syndication and crammed into a 22-minute timeframe, that is disastrous not only because several minutes of footage are removed, but also it runs the risk of the episode being non-sensical because too much footage is removed.

With as slow of a release schedule as Lion's Gate has resorted to  since the season 3 DVD set, one would think that that would give them the time to ensure quality DVD releases. That seemed to be the case, as the season 4 DVD set was perfect, but Lion's Gate is back to business as usual: inferior DVD season sets. This time though, they are doing us a sincere three-fold disservice by:
1) giving us syndicated versions of episodes on DVD,
2) not labeling the DVDs as containing syndicated versions,
3) charging us the same price as the other season DVD sets for an inferior product.

Like a previous reviewer suggested, it's time to start the boycott. Lion's Gate has to realize that we're not happy about this release, nor are we willing to tolerate any more syndicated episodes on DVD! I urge you to contact them now to let them know how you feel about this. It takes only a few voices to elicit change.",1157846400,24,2093,4.648648648648648
2599222,3,B000G1R3A8,"I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.

The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!

Good show, and just a ok season.....Still worth the buy!",1157760000,,1260,4.546255506607929
2599223,1,B000G1R3A8,"What is going on with this set? WILL & GRACE has one of the slowest release schedules so you;'d think there would be plenty of time for adding bonus features (and assembling clips from this season's episodes into three-minute montages is nobody's idea of a bonus). Where are the commentaries by the entire cast? Its just cheap. Now, we find out that the episodes are syndicated versions with minutes trimmed from each episode? Who in their right mind wants to collect edited episodes (especially when the show is playing four times a day on TV in that same edited format). People who buy season TV sets are collectors and want COMPLETE episodes. There's no excuse for foisting episodes that were edited to make room for more commercials after it went into syndication. And anyone who thinks we should be happy for such shoddy treatment, i ask, ""Would you by a movie on DVD that had a musical number, an action chase scene or some dialog cut from the version you saw in the theatre?""",1157587200,129,982,4.649425287356322

What was Lion's Gate thinking?  I think they really need to re-release the season, and allow people (who purchased this rip-off) free exchanges.",1157587200,46,504,4.516483516483516
2599225,3,B000G1R3A8,"Season 5 was the beginning of the end for Will and Grace. This is where it really became obvious that the show was going downhill (and never recovered). This is chiefly due to two things: bad scripts and too many guest stars. To put it quite simply, the show just wasn't that funny anymore. Amusing yes, but far too often I was simply chuckling when I should've been gasping for air after having laughed so hard. But I didn't. It was kind of sad, really. The whole plot about Will and Grace trying to have a child was abandoned after three episodes, but not before they had the mother of all spats that quite simply was too real to be funny or enjoyable. And then it got worse. The addition of Harry Connick Jr. as Grace's boyfriend and eventual husband may have sounded good on paper, but on screen was simply disastrous. Connick Jr. is in fact a very capable and likable actor, but he was completely lost and not very funny. It's not really his fault. The writers didn't know what to do with him, and once they discovered that, kept him off the show as much as possible (a wise choice). Likewise the character of Elliot only appeared once (another pointless character). The whole season wasn't a total loss, as there were some gems scattered in there, but clearly the magic was gone. And the proliferation of ""guest stars"" was too gimmicky and distracting and again not funny, particularly Madonna, in a painful appearance as Karen's roommate!

  Now as for the DVD, as a few people have noted, the episodes on the set are not the original broadcast episodes, but ones trimmed for syndication. Those who don't watch the show religiously probably won't notice, but for the rest of us, this is inexusable. Most episodes have been trimmed by a minute or two, but some have been hacked, as they were originally either an hour long or one of NBC's ""Supersized Episodes."" In any event, it's an insult to the fans who now have to wait a full year between releases. The whole point of having these episodes on DVD is to have the entire, uncut shows, and to have these shortened ones instead is a disservice to the fans and is just plain lazy. But, unfortunately, unless enough people complain or refuse to purchase these truncated sets, this is as good as it's going to get.",1157587200,11,2268,4.540342298288508

2599228,4,B000G1R3A8,"""Will & Grace"" was a landmark comedy and featured richly developed characters and wonderful relationships. Season Five of the series was a bit patchy and you can start to see the foundation of what made this show great start to crack. There are some brilliant episodes here so this is not a season to miss. Unfortunately, the characters started to become parodies of themselves towards the end of the season. I loved this show and it saddened me to see its painful decline. Will got insufferably neurotic. Grace had no energy and seemed disinterested. Karen became a shrill buffoon and Jack became constantly hammy. The worst part of this was that they all lost the spark that made their relationships so fun and genuine.

Thankfully, the episodes in this season didn't suffer from those ills. The writing still seemed fresh and the characters were still engaging. I recently picked up the series finale on DVD as season five is the last full season I'm willing to spend my hard-earneds on.",1156982400,2,990,4.823529411764706

Harry Connick Jr did such an amazing job as Leo - Grace's future husband.  He was funnier than I thought and really bought something extra to the show.

The main focus of this season is when Grace meets Leo and their blosoming relationship that eventually leads them to marriage (the wedding was the best two episodes of the season).  Madonna actually also did a good guest spot in mid season.

This dvd is an absolute must for all Will and Grace fans, and even if you aren't a big fan of this outstanding series, you'll still get some laughs out of it, because I think it'd be impossible to watch it and not find it funny.
