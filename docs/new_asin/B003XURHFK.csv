8408543,5,B003XURHFK,"My husband and I got to see this video at a paranormal convention this past summer, before it came out. We were highly impressed with the contents, as the others at the convention seemed to be as well.
John has a great number of artifacts in his museum and many of them, such as ouija boards, are duplicates. It would be impossible, as well as pointless, to attempt to fit any more items into this movie. As far as I could tell, the interviews conducted on this video were not intended as ""filler,"" but rather a method of breaking up the monotony and giving viewers more information, rather than just throwing a bunch of different objects into the mix and confusing the viewer. As I said before, the museum has a diversity of items. From what I understood, the idea was to showcase some of the more significant ones which would make the viewer want to visit the museum to see more....not to waste a bunch of time and funds on an hour long ""show and tell"" spree( or 40 minute spree,I didn't sit there with a stopwatch, as apparently other people do). Not to mention the fact that if a large number of items were shown, why on earth would someone want to visit the museum? They already have the ability to get a personal, in-depth tour of everything from the comfort of their own home.
Lastly, to recommend John's biography as an alternative over ""Museum of the Paranormal"" is highly illogical and actually kind of confusing. ""Museum"" is not, nor did it ever claim to be, a biography of John. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Each movie serves it's own purpose and is geared towards two totally different facets of John. Watching one to compensate for the other would be completely innaccurate.",1293148800,2,1698,4.5704918032786885
8408544,2,B003XURHFK,"John Zaffis has been called the godfather of the paranormal, a nephew of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the most famous ghost hunters/demonologists in the paranormal world.  I had heard of his `museum' of paranormal objects - objects that had been given to him because the owners of these objects did not want them in their houses.  I had seen glimpses of his museum in other paranormal shows, so when I discovered this DVD, I was excited and had great expectations of the quality of this venture and of the chilling items that we were sure to discover.  Those expectations were not met.

First of all let me inform you that no way - no how is this DVD worth $19.95.  The back of the DVD case claims a ""fascinating one hour tour through the largest and most diverse paranormal museum in history ... the mysterious and at times dark tales behind a collection over 35 years in the making, with well over a thousand items...""  Sounds awesome, right?  Wrong.  We are shown a total of  11 items out of a thousand.  They dedicate a whole five minutes to each item, with dramatizations of embarrassingly bad acting.
The items are as follows:

Two clown dolls
A civil war jacket
A broom
A teddy bear
A ventriloquist dummy
A crucifix
A voodoo doll
A statue of Mary
A wedding dress
A globe
A glass encased rose

I timed how long the actual `movie' was as they call it: 40 minutes.  And what about the remaining 20 minutes of this supposed hour long movie?  Well you get bloopers.  The rest of this DVD is an interview with two people from a paranormal group about a weird experience they had on one of their investigations.  It was not interesting nor did it add anything to the DVD.  It was filler.  They could have used those 20 extra minutes showing us four more items from the museum.",1288569600,7,1771,4.447204968944099
8408545,5,B003XURHFK,Had hell of a time even getting B & N to say the DVD exists. Then after purchasing the DVD I attempted to locate a second DVD by the same auther and they still couldn't locate my first DVD that I'd just bought. The second one I wished to also buy was never located. I feel sorry for the auther who thinks B & N is taking care of business and helping move their product. Not by what I've seem. And no! Still no second DVD!!! That's all!,1286755200,,435,3.9545454545454546
