8498394,3,B006HGXGSO,"This is another African-American stoner film. The characters are introduced humorously grindhouse style with their names and a brief description by their face, including Harold the dog. Loose (Demetrius Dedmon) is a former HS football player who believes he is a ninja, although that never comes into play. His partner Left (Christopher Michael Holley) is a HS drop out who rides a bicycle and thinks he is a rapper, although that was not well developed either. He is named Left because ""he ain't right.""

Our two main characters are parking lot security men who spend most of their time getting high and taking advice from a cartoon ""Black Jesus"" who they sometimes see. When they witness a crime in the parking lot our duo spring into action, but because they smell like pot, calling the police is not an option.

The humor was fairly predictable and even immature. I liked the characters, the story, but the lines needed some help. This is one of the better African-American stoner films, but there is room for much improvement.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, one implied oral sex scene, no nudity.",1343606400,,1096,4.881720430107527
