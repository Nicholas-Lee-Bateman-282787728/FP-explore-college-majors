Many complain about D.V.D.-R burns but everything I have gotten from Warner Archive is top quality. I had a discussion with a friend of mine that formerly worked for a company that did D.V.D.-R  burns & since he was no longer a employee had nothing to gain, I asked him if they were much inferior & he stated they should last as long as official pressings or burns & that they were all subject to scratches causing damage but that the materials were of equal quality & the only problem I might run into is based more on how a player reads the disc. As far as this movie goes' it ranks up there with the best of Reeves stuff. Steve's two appearances as Sandokan offer everything you might be looking for in a exotic action movie, the flora & fauna are beautiful & make a wonderful back drop for this great period piece! During Steve Reeves short career he managed to cover a lot of theme's he was a cop in ""Jail Bait"", The Trojan hero Aneas in ""The Trojan Horse"" & ""The Avenger's"", the son of the famous freedom fighter Spartacus in ""The Slave"" Two showings as Hercules in ""Hercules"" & Hercules Unchained"", The notorious Pirate Captain Morgan in ""The Pirate Morgan"" A humble generous thief in ""The Thief of Bagdad"" A Roman Christian avenger in ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" & Mike Sturgis a cowboy out for revenge in ""A Long Ride from Hell""& a tribal freedom fighter in ""The White Warrior"" adapted from a Leo Tolstoy novel & A enraged wood cutter bent on vengeance in ""Terror of the Barbarians"" & One of the twins that founded Rome in ""Romulus & Remus"" !!! Yes Steve was a busy man!!  His portrayal of Sandokan in both ""Sandokan the Great"" & ""Sandokan, Pirate of Malaysia"" are great additions to his list of heroic characters. A must have for Steve Reeves fans. Stuck working for Italian producers in what would be labeled Spaghetti films don't look for any Academy Award worthy films in Steve Filmography but you are guaranteed family fun & excitement!!!",1416873600,5,2046,4.497311827956989
8219375,5,B000VLPV3O,"Even though he's supposedly a pirate, the movie starts off by the shore, but from then on it's on foot the rest of the movie. Other than that I really enjoyed the movie, color & brightness were superb. I would highly recommend it for any Steve Reeves fan.",1416268800,,255,4.333333333333333
8219376,5,B000VLPV3O,"Very good though rather long adventure with Steve Reeves.  He plays an Indonesian prince battling the conquering British, particularly a brutal, dishonorable colonel.  The Warner Archives DVD-R release is probably the best one can find.  The picture is crystal clear and the color is exquisite.  The running tme seems to be complete at 110 minutes.  The TeleVista DVD release is good quality but does not compare with Warner's.  Highly recommended.",1392595200,,448,5.328571428571428
8219377,4,B000VLPV3O,"Warner Archive releases the first of two films involving the character of Sandokan, a popular Middle Eastern hero in Director Umberto Lenzi's 'SANDOKAN THE GREAT' aka 'SANDOKAN LA TIGRA DI MONPRACEN' aka 'SANDOKAN LE TIGRE DI BORNEO'- 1963 and played by Steve Reeves who graced the screen in many heroic incarnations (Hercules among them) who seeks revenge on the British soldiers who slaughtered his mother and forced his father into exile.  The film contains many great set pieces such as elephant stampedes, tiger wrestling and head hunting natives predating Director Lenzi's later infamous cannibal forays which makes for an enjoyable 100 minute affair. Genre stalwart Andrea Bosic and the beautiful Genevieve Grad who played in other sword and sandal films are along for the party.  It has great location photography lensed on the island of Ceylon by Angelo Lotti and Aurelio Guiterez Larrata and a rousing music score by Giovanni Fusco.  Warner Archive presents the film in a 2.35 widescreen presentation with no extras , the negative fluctuating from clear, brilliant colors to fuzzy faded images depending on the reel changes.  Reeves would team with Lenzi again for 'THE PIRATES OF MALAYSIA' aka 'I PIRATI DELLA MALAYSIA' -1964 continuing Sandokan's adventures and culminating in a rarely seen off shoot entitled 'TEMPLE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT' aka 'SANDOKAN IL MACISTE DELLA GIUNGLA' made the same year and starring Errol Flynn's son Sean donning the red turban and giving Steve Reeves a well deserved breather.  It makes for a great Saturday afternoon time waster, films which unfortunately are few and far between in our CGI modern age.",1358553600,5,1647,5.2
8219378,4,B000VLPV3O,"There is no doubt that Steve Reeves has been the best actor to impersonate the famous Malaysia's Tiger created by the italian writer Emilio Salgari.
At least the best before the coming to the italian tv screen of the indian actor Kabir Bedy, the best Sandokan ever.
The movie directed by the italian Umberto Lenzi is very good, with a good screen play and photography.
Absolutely a must to see for esotic adventures' lovers.",1264982400,3,424,4.743243243243243
