How Prime allowed such a wretched ""grade school"" film project on its site is beyond me.",1465948800,,265,4.595744680851064
8149806,3,B000JCDQZ0,"Cute retro styled fun, give it a shot if you need something to get free shipping...  otherwise not much for a rewatch.  BTW these are not full length these are 2 shorts that only TOTAL 51 minutes.  So, yeah 2 shorts with a Ed Wood feel to it.",1404172800,,242,4.0
8149807,1,B000JCDQZ0,One of the worst films I've ever seen...in all genres.  I'm convinced they were trying to get a bad review from the get-go.  They couldn't have taken this seriously. They probably made this film in less than a week.  Avoid!,1378339200,,223,4.525
8149808,1,B000JCDQZ0,"As a HUGE fan of bad movies I must say that this one takes the cake! It is beyond being so bad it's entertaining... This ""film"" is just plain terrible and i don't mean that in a good way! It could have been saved potentially if the cast was remotely good looking or if there was at least some nudity. Don't bother taking mind altering substances while watching this film  as that will not even save it or make it slightly tolerable.  The only thing this film is good for is using it as a coaster for your beer or re-gifting it to someone you hate!",1330387200,2,547,4.150943396226415
8149809,5,B000JCDQZ0,"The movie was first shot as a college project in Canada. It was designed to be zero budget and bad. Jupiter and Uranus are at war. Two men are dispatched to Earth to obtain fuel. They are confronted by the Canadian chapter of the International Go-Go Girl Crime Fighters.

In the second film, an evil Easter Bunny look alike comes to earth whose mission is to conquer the Earth and the universe. Excessive amount of go-go dancing.

The movie contains many bad Uranus jokes. The movies are campy and are as clean as Canada. No sex, nudity, or bad language. This is a must for bad film collectors. You can watch two movies in less time than it takes to watch 60 Minutes.",1311292800,2,667,4.414634146341464
