8352526,1,B0026FD4I2,So since I have to put a star I only got through the first not even 10mins! DONT DO IT! So dry and boring! If you want to sleep and can't then it's a wonderful thing to watch.,1471564800,,175,3.6315789473684212
8352527,5,B0026FD4I2,I buy mostly CD's that I listened to them 1st and rated them 5 stars A Must for any Neo-Prog Lover,1384473600,,98,3.7142857142857144
8352528,5,B0026FD4I2,I have read all the reviews and comments and feel they are a bit unfair. One must remember that Pendragon are not a mainstream band. Yes the picture could have been better. My wife and I love it!. We watched it on our HD tv and Sony surround system and it looks good and sounds great!,1384473600,,284,4.089285714285714
8352529,3,B0026FD4I2,"I receive today my order and my expectations are very high.
I want to see a new concert of one of my favorite bands but with the magic of the blu ray quality.
Fans of Pendragon.....i'm sorry. The concert is very similar to the DVD ""and now everybody to the stage..."" and the picture and sound quality is.......THE SAME!!!!!!
The picture is very grainy and the sound denotes a some kind of dinamic compression.
This concert is filmed in the same theater of the last DVD's, the Wyspianski Theatre in Katowice, Poland.
The set list is very good and perfectly played by this excellent musicians, but if you buy this new blu ray edition don't think to find a different Pendragon show.",1352160000,4,679,4.573770491803279
8352530,3,B0026FD4I2,"Had high expectations for a BD coming from Pendragon but the end result is a mixed bag: poor video quality for a blu ray, no DTS sound...the setlist and energy coming from the band are great but Concerto Maximo is still the crown jewel in terms of performance.",1349049600,3,260,4.4375
8352531,4,B0026FD4I2,"The tradition continue with Pendragon, to do a DVD to Katowice in Poland at the same venue. You can collect the DVD's with a 90% different set list each time. This is their first Blu-Ray and i though that it would be time to have a nice surround mix, but it's not the case here again. This a PCM 5.1 mix with a unpleasant reverb echo. Not that the sound is terrible, but why make a 5.1 mix if it don't add anything.

The show contains a lot of songs from the two latests cd's, which show the band incorporated some heavy parts, more obvious in these songs ; ""Comatose"", ""Freakshow"" and ""Empathy"", the latter has even a rap section. ""Feeding Frenzzy"" tell it all, it's really frenzy! The Passion's CD have been written to fit the new dynamic style of the drummer Scott Higham. The standout track is  at the first encore ; ""Indigo"" who reminds us of the band Arena and Pink Floyd for the Gilmour guitar style of Nick Barrett.

I hope that the band will continue into this direction, because their sound was becoming too polished, and repetitive. It was time to bring some chaos in their music. The Blu-Ray contains also a interview with Nick and a documentary of 45 minutes that it's worth watching one time with Nick behind the camera.",1349049600,3,1234,4.427312775330397
8352532,1,B0026FD4I2,"It's NOT A MOVIE!  It's rather dull, with no dialogue at all.  Only dry narration and rather stilted acting.  Sort of like a boring Discovery channel documentary of British flora, occasionally interrupted by weird people walking around with  swords and chewing bits of meat.  If you work night shift, and you suffer daytime insomnia, this DVD is for you.",1254441600,8,354,4.932203389830509
