8429241,5,B004H1UB0M,"The OCW studs and starlets are back in this fantastic new DVD.

For the uninitiated, OCW is an indy fed featuring some of the hottest young guys and girls wrestling in creative settings, no holds barred; and this DVD is the perfect sampler featuring matches from all of the first four seasons of the federation's online wrestling show.  The venues are varied (swimming pools, locker rooms, traditions rings, and even a cage!) and the action goes nonstop.

Being a gay man, I'm mostly interested in the boys (SCAB, ""Dangerous"" Devon, the Brodys, Slick Nick & Mr. Instant Replay, Bad Ass Baily, and Slater; the eye candy never ends) but there are plenty of hot chicks for you straight guys to enjoy.

In short this is an excellent DVD with something to please everybody!

P.S.: OCW features TNA's ""Generation ME"" wrestling as the ""Young Bucks.""  If you're fans of theirs, DEFINITELY check this DVD out!

P.P.S.: Check out the website ocwrestling.tv for complete seasons of the show.",1299628800,3,980,4.867469879518072
