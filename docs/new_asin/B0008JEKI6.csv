8056318,3,B0008JEKI6,"This reviews the 1991 Fischer-Dieskau performance of Schubert's Die Schoene Muellerin, from Arthaus DVD.

I have been listening to a lot of old DFD records on his 90th birthday weekend.  They have ranged from his 1949 St. Matthew Passion up thru the next four decades to this 1991 Schoene Muellerin, and it has been quite an adventure.  I have to say with a little sadness, I would not recommend this DVD other than to those who have already been lifetime fans of his.  It is not to his credit as one of the most admired singers of the 20th century.

Or shall I say, if I had never heard of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, I would have no idea he was considered one of the greatest singers of the 20th century, from the performance on this video.

Not that it is abominably terrible, it isn't.  It's just average.  He sounds like any retired music teacher who has had a good career at the local junior college.  And I would also carefully say, he both looks and sounds quite a bit older than 66.  This is not meant to be disrespectful, only to help you make choices in record buying, if like me your purchasing funds are finite.

Remember him as he was in his earlier years.  He made several other recordings of Muellerin--they are light-years better.  And I don't know why his videography is so sparse.  There is hardly anything out there.  He is one of the most recorded classical artists of all time;  why no video?  Why does his near-contemporary Karajan have so many dozens of videos, and DFD almost none?

Now, there is one more item to add here, and I don't think I need to say it as carefully.  The sound engineering is inept.  First of all it is recorded at a very low level, so one has to bring the amplifier up to about 75% for a reasonable listening level, whereas maybe 50% is usual for other DVDs.  That's fine, as long as it is consistent.  Then on the last number, it seems the sound engineer realized his error, which wasn't really an error, and decided he had better correct it.  So he hurriedly turns the knob, and the last number blasts you.  There's really no excuse for such sloppiness.  Did they have a teenager in the booth that day?  And I also believe, it could have been corrected in the modern remastering, and of course, it wasn't.",1432944000,,2254,4.4365853658536585
8056319,3,B0008JEKI6,"Having admirred Fischer-Dieskau for half a century I am more than willing to watch him perform this beloved cycle in his declining years with declining vocal powers.  However, as a document of the great singer's artistry, this DVD falls short simply because the sound engineer has chosen to ride gain on the performance...meaning he tried to compensate for the changes of volume that occur throughout the performance instead of letting the performers themselves move between loud and soft on their own.  This is particularily noticeable in the last few songs.  This mistaken practice even creates an unmusical ""buzz"" in the final songs.  Technology here undercuts the artistic element rather than simply being there to present it to us.  Too bad.",1320451200,,746,5.183333333333334
8056320,3,B0008JEKI6,"This DVD reprises a performance of Die schoene Muellerin from 1991, Fischer-Dieskau's first performance of the cycle in 20 years.  The concert was recorded by a TV crew for broadcast.  The video itself is fine -- mostly footage of Fischer-Dieskau and Schiff alternating with each other, with the occasional reaction shot from the audience and footage of sheet music interspersed occasionally.  Halfway through, someone comes up with the interesting notion of doing a split-screen dissolve with the top half showing Fischer-Dieskau in close-up and the bottom half showing Schiff -- this is far and away the most useful bit of the video presentation.

The performance itself is unfortunately somewhat uneven.  Fischer-Dieskau was in his late 60's by this time, his voice had clearly seen better days (he retired two years afterwards), and there's a shouty, barky quality to some of the singing that is not always pleasing to listen to.  There are at least one or two brain farts in the text, and one significant flub in the second verse of Die liebe Farbe.  But on the other hand, his keen intelligence and sense of drama shine through as always, and there are some very interesting takes on how to make the poems come dramatically alive.

Watching him perform is sort of interesting -- unfortunately there are about five or six stock gestures that he continually does, one involving rotating to his right and putting his hands on the short-stick piano lid, one involving turning to the left and stepping away, and a few others, and they seem more like nervous tics to me than useful illustrations of his performance art.  But with some of the songs, he is quite dramatically effective in getting meaning across with a mix of economical glance and gesture.

So the disc is an essential document for Fischer-Dieskau fans who want a sense of what one of the great Lieder singers of the century looked like in concert  (I for one am an amateur singer not lucky enough to have seen him myself in performance).  It is unfortunately not the greatest performance of Die schoene Muellerin ever (and not even DFD's greatest -- for me that would remain the EMI studio disc with Gerald Moore from the 1950's).",1130630400,5,2196,4.857908847184986
8056321,4,B0008JEKI6,"In my early 20s,  I was bewitched by Fischer Dieskau's voice despite the fact that I was also attracted to some other opera singers, first the sopranos and then the tenors. Nevertheless, I still find Schwarzkopf and Fischer Dieskau's lieders intriquing.

However, I have recently come across an interview on Fischer Dieskau which took place a few years back where he frankly admitted he couldn't understand why he sang this and that in the way he did, that he certainly wouldn't do so now! (He also made it plain that he wouldn't even think of becoming a conductor.) Is he much different now? The answer is a mixed one.

Well, there are some gossips that when Artur Rubinstein, late in his prime, played some wrong notes, nobody dared to remind him about it... Obviously Dieskau is different as he is open and reflective. And I have recently read Menuhin who obviously held something against his sense of rhythm... oop!  To be fair, there are also some very positive comments by some other critics on his diction too and that is on top of his splendid voice.

In any event, I take Dieskau's own advice, and I have since begun to see his lieders in a different light and I begin to refer to and compare him with say Hans Hotter, another great lieder singer. And in any event, to enjoy Dieskau voice in video more fully, one could refer the EMI album featuring him, Schwarzkopf and Seefred albeit his voice here is still in good shape...

Schiff is one of my idols and needless to say, he is gorgous. He is more proactive than either Gerald Moore or Geoffrey Parsons, but not quite as bold as Furtwangler the conductor when the latter accompanied Schwarzkopf on the keyboard.",1127865600,,1673,4.616161616161616
8056322,5,B0008JEKI6,"I confess I burst into tears as the recital began on this DVD. Having been one of the fortunate few to have heard Fidi in numerous recitals, having listened to his recordings for the past half-century, I observed that he had only gotten better with age.

Mr. Morrison offers valuable reasoning in his review, and I respect him. But there is another element to consider, and that is the growth of an artist during the extension of the entire career. For in each stage of his life and vocation, Fidi has shown his ever-expanding soulful intellect at work, and the turn of vocal affect. No two performances of a given work have been quite the same, as he has readjusted the axis of the poetic vision. No great poem need be read the same way twice; no sublime sonnet suffers from a new understanding of a line previously unemphasized. And Fidi surprises us in every recording.

In this respect, Fidi is comparable to the great Russian piano masters of the Late Romantic School, on the poetic level of, say, Lhevinne and Rosenthal and Horowitz. The latter comes to mind (and I note this for my slightly younger readers) as in his advanced years, Horowitz' technical aspects declined, but the poetry, the lyricism actually increased. With Fidi, however, not only has the poetic vision accelerated as you hear never-before-heard nuances, but the technical mastery has its own coloration, too.

By contrast, you see the 35-year-old Fidi in a 1960 videotape, re-released on DVD by EMI, in which the technical mastery is all there, right down to the last hemidemisemiquaver, but the poetry is nowhere near the height of the present laureate. In fact, in 1960, you see an aggressive Fidi, a little over-acted, not quite so sure of his relationship with the kinescope machine. But in the present recital, you see him in full command of his emotions, utterly self-confident of the work and his ability. Yet, both are exciting to see, because you know the artistic story of Fidi's life. (See the Amazon link for EMI's terrific DVD of this 1960 video: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001AW098/qid%3D1119406478/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-7388598-3106239)

I see Fidi in the same light as others who have achieved their greatest heights in advanced age, as one whom everyone thought had hit the apex at 30, no, at 40, no, at 50, and so on. Again, the Russians cited above. And in my line of work, I reflect that St. John wrote his gospel when an old man, and though not all may agree with its theology, there's no mistaking his spiritual, and even poetic, vision, and that he is entirely confident that what he says is the truth.

Moving on to another plateau: There's the matter of the artist's communication. Singers are unique among musicians in that, in recital anyhow, they must have a direct eye contact with the audience. Speaking of Horowitz, you remember from the DVD of his Moscow recital, the gazes of the children whilst he played ""Scenes from Childhood,"" and how you reached for the tissue. Well, Horowitz looked back at them through the notes. A singer, however, must do it through the notes, the words and the eye contact.

Reflect with me, please, that this is no studio recording with a singer wearing headphones in an orgiastic experience with a microphone. This is the laureate, whom you see frequently offering his hands and arms to the audience, beckoning them into his embrace through a long life with Schubert, with the implicit understanding that he is telling them, ""Believe me, this is what the composer and the poet are saying, and what I sing to you is the truth.""

Gimme a break! In this DVD, Fidi hasn't the opportunity as in a studio for take after take with Sir Gerald Moore at the piano, but has to hit it right every time, every nuance. So a rollantando goes into a glissando here and there. So what?  And, golly, here you have Andras Schiff, that wonderful artist, the successor of Glenn Gould in his Bach mastery, yet in the unenviable position of having to replace the late Sir Gerald, which is a pretty gutsy thing to do, and by God he does it!

On this plateau, this DVD is the height of audacity. Fidi at sixty-five, with a new tag-team partner, entering the ring of a brave new world of technically proficient youngsters who hit all the notes, exactly on schedule, the new kids on the block lacking so much as an ounce of poetry in their souls.

There is every reason why this DVD should be a outrageous success. I'm only fifty-nine, and I've just got to believe there are millions of folks like myself who turned on their radios and stereos to listen to this muse when in the dark undergraduate life of the '60s, and found a compatriot in Fidi, who guided us, as much as scripture and the rare friendly professor who helped us make sense of life.

Finally, you remember Fidi and Sir Gerald's sweet recording of Schubert's ""An die Musik""? You will find in this DVD the equivalent expression, ""An die Fidi."" How grateful we should be for these glorious 83 minutes with the unassailable master of lieder until the end of time as we know it. Fidi is retired, and you'll never have a better chance for a ""being there"" experience. Get out your credit card and buy it. Right now already, while there are still a few copies left. And when it arrives, race to the DVD player, listen, and drop to your knees to thank God for this rare event in your life!",1119312000,19,5383,4.703821656050955
8056323,4,B0008JEKI6,"I have really mixed feelings about what I am about to say about this DVD of a 1991 performance by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau of Schubert's 'Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin,' accompanied by Andr&aacute;s Schiff. The sad fact is that this performance captures the 66-year-old FiDi just a tad too late in his career. Indeed, he sang his farewell concert only a year or so later. He has just celebrated his 80th birthday as I write this and this DVD is released partly in honor of that occasion. Filmed by Austrian Television at the 1991 Feldkirch Schubertiade, where FiDi had been a fixture for years, this marks the first and only collaboration with Schiff, one of the most sensitive pianists of our time. The singer's  performance itself is marked by incredible sensitivity not only to the words -- one could always count of FiDi for that -- but also to the poetic contributions of the marvelous piano accompaniment; he clearly is in complete accord with Schiff, who does not play the shrinking accompanist but is an equal partner here. Schiff's contribution is a bit bumptious in spots, but this certainly reflects the navet&eacute; of Wilhelm M&uuml;ller's words. And in the more inward songs (e.g. Der Neugierige, Morgengruss, Pause) his almost inaudible pianissimo matches the incredible soft singing of Fischer-Dieskau. These are undoubtedly the most moving of the songs. In the more outward, and up-tempo, songs (e.g. Ungeduld, Mein!, Der J&auml;ger) FiDi's voice betrays him. In 'Mein!', for instance, his voice simply won't move fast enough to negotiate all the notes comfortably and there are, alas, some approximate pitches; perhaps it would have been better to moderate the tempo a bit. Another real problem is that above mezzo-forte the center of the voice, particularly in low and mid-range, becomes hollow. The brightness of FiDi's upper range remains nearly as it was when he recorded this cycle the last time with Gerald Moore in 1971.

Having registered quibbles about the condition of Fischer-Dieskau's voice, I must hasten to add that this is as knowing and poetically moving a performance of 'Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin' as I've ever heard (other than earlier ones by FiDi himself). This tall, trim, handsome and impeccably groomed singer, the model of a cosmopolite, conveys the longing, excitement, pain and emotionality of M&uuml;ller's nave young man with voice and facial expression such that you feel the young man's emotions almost directly. This is singing and acting of real genius. And that's what we love and admire FiDi for. The voice, yes, in earlier years was glorious, but it was always the unmannered art that seems artless that always drew us to him, and still does in his many recordings of the forty years from the late 1940s to the late 1980s. One of a kind, this singer, and one worthy of our profoundest admiration.

Andr&aacute;s Schiff has recorded 'Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin' before, with tenor Peter Schreier, and good as the playing is in that recording, his conception matured and ripened in the two years since that release in 1989.

It pains me to award this release only four stars. But I feel one must warn lovers of voices qua voices (and there are many people who don't care for the acting or the expression of the meaning of the poetry) that here we have FiDi some distance beyond the peak period for his voice. Otherwise, though, for lovers of Lieder and  particularly of this cycle, this DVD is a marvelous experience and for them would probably rate five stars.

There is a charming and insightful interview with Fischer-Dieskau appended as an extra on this disc. He was interviewed by Franz Zoglauer, also for Austrian TV, at a previous  Schubertiade in 1985.

Videography is calm and unobtrusive, precisely what one wants in a presentation such as this. Sound is LPCM Stereo and possibly just a bit dated. Subtitle languages for the interview with the singer (in German) are English, French, Italian and Spanish. The texts of the songs have those subtitle languages and the option of subtitles in German as well.

Recommended, with the stated caveat about the condition of the singer's voice.
