8217942,5,B000CSTE5C,"Excellent 101 training PLUS a fresh new look at classic techniques and how to do them better. Well worth every penny for those who want a solid game, and a few tricks to keep the seasoned people at bay. Can not say enough good about this! The one camera angle is annoying but they repeat the techniques so much you get it and then some.
