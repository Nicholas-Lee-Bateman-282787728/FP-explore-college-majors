8577212,2,B00C41NIJI,"I was unable to listen to the CD ""Raphael Saadiq Live in Paris.""  I tried playing the CD on two different CD players and no music played on either one.  I don't know what it sounds like because I was unable to listen to it.  The CD appears to be defective.",1375488000,,256,3.980392156862745
8577213,5,B00C41NIJI,"I enjoyed the concert. It wasn't too short or too long, it didn't involve a lot of sexual content, just an artist and his band doing what they do best, singing and playing instruments. I was impressed with the singing abilities of Erica and Charles, the piano player, as well as the obvious mastery of their instruments by members of his band. My hope is that anyone watching this CD will conclude that practice really does make perfect.",1357862400,,437,4.615384615384615
8577214,5,B00C41NIJI,I saw Raphael Saadiq in concert at the House of Blues in Hollywood a few years ago and it was the best live shows I have ever seen.

8577215,5,B00C41NIJI,"Raphael Saadiq Live in Paris Concert DVD is totally outstanding! There is no denying this man's brilliance and talent.  I have been a fan of Raphael Saadiq since his Tony! Toni! Tone days and always knew the great talent he has and this live concert DVD proves it even further how much of an accomplished artist he is! I was mesmerized the moment that he walked on the stage and picked up that guitar. He has such stage presence and the music that he delivered was captivating, wonderful and soulful. I love how he continues to represent true R&B music adding his own style to it which is one of the reasons I feel that he is so successful and sought after to this day. Not only has he performed enormous hits of his own, he has also written and produced hit songs for many other artists. Ladies, I have to add, Raphael is looking sooooo good in this DVD! ; ) If you are a fan of his, you should own this DVD. You will not be disappointed. The concert goers definitely got their money's worth and so does the purchasers of this DVD! : ) Raphael, you rock!!! God Bless You!",1347753600,,1072,4.280788177339901

8577217,5,B00C41NIJI,"Hey Guys, this is NOT an PAL DVD (as stated by AMAZON), it's a NTSC (REGION 0) DVD!
===================================================================================
Here's a criminally overlooked DVD by a criminally overlooked artist.
It's a live DVD shot at Bataclan Theatre in Paris.
And WHAT A DVD!!!
Excelent picture and sound! (though I think it's only stereo, not DTS or 5.1, as I do not have a proper sound system)
And WHAT A PERFORMANCE!!!
The fans are great, Saadiq is great and WHAT A GREAT BAND!!!
This is one of those special moments that so rarely get caught on screen!
THE BEST DVD I'VE BOUGHT IN YEARS.
I'm a big fan of SEAL, but, all things accounted, SAADIQ LIVE IN PARIS DVD is better than SEAL LIVE IN PARIS DVD. And SEAL LIVE IN PARIS is also great.
If you're a fan of SAADIQ, BUY IT!
If you're a fan of SOUL and ROCK, BUY IT! (The guitarrist will mesmerize any rock fan)
If you're a fan of LIVE music, BUY IT!!!
Actually, if you're a fan of MUSIC, THEN BUY IT!!!
You will NOT be disappointed...",1285804800,9,1018,4.5683060109289615
