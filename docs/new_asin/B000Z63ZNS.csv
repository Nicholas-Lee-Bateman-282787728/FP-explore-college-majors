The Bedford Theatre in Camden High Street, once Britain's oldest music-hall, has now been torn down and replaced by an anonymous office-block. The Round House, once used as a train shed, now operates as a performance venue. The Victorian slums around Camden have now been torn down and replaced by anonymous- looking tower blocks. The old gas-lamps (and the lamplighter who went round each night), if they exist at all, are simply there to attract tourist photographers. And rarely do we ever see a horse and cart plodding along the streets.

On the other hand there are some rituals that continue to flourish. The street-markets are still vividly alive, even though the customers are far more multicultural than they were nearly half a century ago. The Salvation Army plies its trade, and poverty is still rife throughout the city; beggars line the streets, just as they did a century and a half ago. Buskers still ply their trade in the streets (try going to Covent Garden to find out), even though their acts are different now. Watching THE London NOBODY KNOWS is an experience in savoring change and continuity.

James Mason looks faintly uncomfortable as a presenter, his shiny shoes and expensive cap contrasting with the genteel poverty of many of London's citizens. Sometimes he fluffs his lines; and we wonder why more of the people around him do not stare when they see the presence of an international celebrity within their midst. On the other hand his narration is but a peripheral presence in a documentary that packs so much visual incident into its 40-minute or so running time that it could easily have been extended into twice its length.

Often we are told in modern documentaries about the Sixties and how they transformed British society from a slightly stuffy, class-bound hierarchy into a freer, more hedonistic world. On the evidence of LES BICYCLETTES DE BELSIZE, we are also made aware of the truly bizarre elements of the period.

There is a plot (of sorts) - a young man (Anthony May) climbs out of a window after a night of passion, and embarks on a cycling trip around the highways and byways of the London suburbs of Belsize Park and Hampstead. He encounters a little girl (Leslie Goddard) and together they continue the cycling tour. On the way he looks at a poster of a beautiful girl (Judy Huxtable) - whom he later encounters in the flesh. The two of them go off together to enjoy a romantic idyll, while the little girl meets a beau of her own (Barny Reisz). The tale is broken up with a series of eminently forgettable musical numbers (by Barry Mason).

As Douglas Hickox's camera sweeps around the streets of NW3, we are made aware of the sheer bizarreness of London fashions at that time; the exotic color combinations and the fondness for tight-fitting trousers leaving nothing to the imagination. Kaftans are also in vogue, as well as sunglasses with excessively large lenses. It seems as if every Londoner at that time was out to make a statement and only appeared to look grotesque.

On the other hand, the camera contrasts the outlandishness of the people with the sheer normality of the environment - the narrow, winding streets with terraced houses at each side; the smoke billowing forth from the chimneys; and the relative lack of cars on the road. In 1969 it was still possible for cyclists to enjoy the freedom of the road without having to wear crash helmets.",1450137600,,3556,4.811783960720131
