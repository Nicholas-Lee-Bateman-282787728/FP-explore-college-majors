8089357,5,B000BNMX42,"I have to say I laughed out loud at some of the early commercials on this set.

Yes, the production values were ""interesting"" back when television was starting out - but the results are so funny it doesn't matter.

I bought this DVD on a lark just to see what it was all about and could not believe how silly television advertising was in primative times.

The ads are better than some movies I've seen lately.",1146009600,7,410,4.368421052631579
8089358,5,B000BNMX42,"Boy, has television advertising changed over the years.

If you are used to the gloss, color CGI ads that dominate the tube today you'll be shocked at what ads were like when television was first starting out.

What they lack in techiclal details these ads more than make up for in how creative they were. They clearly didn't know what would work and what wouldn't so they tried every different type of approach they could think of.

The quality of the footage is surprisingly good considering how old the clips are.",1145923200,14,516,4.648351648351649
8089359,5,B000BNMX42,"I'm sure this DVD won't be for everyone, but it sure put a smile on my face.

I've joked with my friends before that when I watch TV, sometimes the ads are more interesting than the shows themselves and this just proves the point.

These ads are often hysterical and brought me back to my youth.

I'm sure that a lot of younger people won't get why they are so funny, but for those of us out there - you know who you are - who remember Snap Crackle Pop, this is outstanding!",1145923200,6,474,4.075268817204301
