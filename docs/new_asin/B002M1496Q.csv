Luckily, I borrowed this from the library before buying. The only positive is that I did work up a sweat. Also difficult to do if you work out on carpet. So many other better videos out there. I would pass on this one.",1477872000,,355,4.159420289855072
8373399,4,B002M1496Q,"Sara Haley moves very quickly, so I found it took longer to learn the work out than other work outs I have. But the cardio was worth it.",1381276800,,136,3.892857142857143
8373400,5,B002M1496Q,"Great for a quick workout at home. The format allows you to choose only one combo if you are in a hurry or combine 2 or 3 for more excercise. First time is a little hard to keep up, but once you get a little familiar with the format you just start getting better and better. I bought this extra copy for a friend, I've had mine for 3 months and Im still not tired of it, you can mix and match combos and you will still feel like you had a great workout.",1320969600,,453,3.8297872340425534
8373401,2,B002M1496Q,"I hate that I have to give this two stars because it really gave me a good cardio workout.  But, the leading is such a disappointment!  For a while, she goes on the beat and then suddenly takes off and no longer matches the music.  For exercises that actually have a beat (cardio, not just strength training), it's pretty important to stick with the music.  I agree with the reviewer that said it was like being in Alice in Wonderland.  For a while, I tried blocking out her directions and just going with the music, but even then, she would be doing four reps of something and drop the fourth beat so we were even further off track.

She does do a good job of making sensible transitions, adding on one piece at a time.  Unfortunately, she doesn't prepare you for it.  About a half beat before you have to change moves, she'll quickly say what's going to happen and there's no time to prepare or figure out what she's saying.

Like others mentioned, the number of repetitions is not equal for each side.  We almost always learn the moves on the right side, so you have the learning phase and then the regular repetitions.  She significantly shortens the learning phase on the left side (understandably), but she doesn't boost the number of repetitions to make up for the difference.

I definitely worked hard, but was so frustrated throughout that I don't really want to do it again.",1302912000,2,1384,4.536290322580645
8373402,2,B002M1496Q,"I agree with another reviewer - great cardio toning exercises and routines, but if you have any sense of rhythm whatsoever, this workout will drive you insane. It sort of feels like a foreign movie with voices dubbed - like they recorded the workout session first and then superimposed the boring music in the background. The second time I did this routine, I decided to set it to mute and found my own electronica music that would fit. But this proved frustrating as well because it was hard to find my own music that worked. To a person like me who is inspired by the music in step classes and aerobics classes to push him / herself, this workout was very disappointing.",1295222400,,672,4.516393442622951
8373403,5,B002M1496Q,"When I first did this workout I did not think it would be so fun, and that I would work quite hard, eventhough for such short workouts.
I like Reebook workouts, and I have bought all of them.
Being a mother of two little children, sometimes I have to take time where is none to do some exercise, this DVD makes that easier, I can mix and match the different workouts as I like, depending on my free time.",1291680000,2,404,4.1265822784810124
8373404,4,B002M1496Q,Great cardio workout. We liked the combination of cardio and strength. We were in good shape to begin with so we didn't mind the times when she kicked it up. I loved using weights during the workouts. Fun!,1289001600,,205,4.421052631578948
8373405,2,B002M1496Q,"I was just shopping around the the other day and as usual, found myself in the fitness/exercise/yoga section. I saw the back of the DVD and thought..finally..a perfect DVD for me.  It had a customizable program that included:
Cardio Combo 1, 2, 3,4--each 11 minutes except #4 which was 7 minutes.
Cardio Sculpt 1 and 2--10 and 11 minutes and
Cardio Core Challenge --10 minutes.
Not only that, according to the back I could Mix and Match to create my own custom workout!!
Sigh....I popped the DVD in, it started with a warm-up which was fine, but then when Cardio Combo 1 started, I saw this was just not going to work.  It looked like the fitness expert was moving to the beat of a drummer in her own head!  If you have any since of rhythm at all, you will be completely thrown for a loop with this one.  The exercises and combos in and of themselves are decent (no fancy moves, just cardio raising movement), but trying to watch this woman move and listen to the the music and her instructions is like being Alice in Wonderland.  Totally confusing.
I finally memorized her combos (thank goodness they were not difficult), turned my back to the TV, tried to ignore her voice and move to the rhythm of the music on my own. It worked as long as I could tune the instructor out!
Couldn't have been more dissapointed, but I gave it two stars because I will keep it now that I have learned the routine and do the exercises on my own...otherwise, this would have been a waste.",1278806400,7,1470,4.409594095940959
8373406,5,B002M1496Q,"I do not break this video up into the smaller sections and I do the entire thing at once,this is an incredible cardio workout. The two sections using handweights were also nice. She uses a lot of functional compound movements to keep your heart rate up while getting your strength training in at the same time. I have two complaints with this workout though, the first is during the first cardio section. She speeds up the movements out of nowhere to a ridiculous pace that leaves you scratching your head for a minute. My second complaint is that she works out your sides very unevenly during the strength portions often giving your right side a lot more attention.",1273363200,,666,4.6525423728813555
8373407,2,B002M1496Q,"I've never exercised to a Reebok video, so didn't know what to expect.  I'll give any exercise video a try.  However, the one thing I don't forgive very often is when the sides are worked unevenly.  Why am I paying for the video except for choreography and the instructor to keep track of repetitions, so I can focus on form and breathing?  Only if (1) I can easily keep count myself and do something about the uneven number and (2) the results are very effective would I do a video that works sides unevenly a second time.  Unfortunately, the number of reps changes so rapidly in some sections it's going to be almost impossible to deal with the uneven sides.  In the cardio sections the instructor did an easy to follow number of repetions per move, but the instructor didn't do the same number of the combinations on each side.  So the side you start with, you work more. For the cardio sculpt sections she did an uneven number of repetions per move and per side.  I don't understand why couldn't she do 4, 8, or 16 repetitions of each move like most instructors?  Plus I thought most of the moves in the cardio sections to be boring.
The video is easy to program.  You can do all cardio, all sculpt, or choose any combinations of all six sections. You can also do the sections in any order.  The sections are Cardio One, Cardio Two, Cardio Three, Cardio Sculpt One, Cardio Sculpt Two, and Bonus Abs.  There is a warm up and cool down no matter how many sections you choose.  I really like how easily the video is to program and there are no lengthy introductions between sections.

I have mixed feelings about the warm up.  I enjoyed the stretches.  So many DVDs skimp on the warm up and cool down sections, it was nice to work out to one at an appropriate level of difficulty.  However, I thought some of the cardio moves were jarring and only seemed to last a few seconds.  The cool down choreography starts with squats for some reason. Then, you move on to the same stretches as in the warm up.

The Cardio sections use similar choreography as Firm videos. You do a lot of squats, lunges, grapevines, and mambos.  Cardio One and Two use different moves and Cardio Three combines some of the moves from the first two together.  There are only one or two moves I haven't seen before in other videos.

The cardio sculpt and bonus abs sections use compound moves to work your entire body.  For example in Cardio Sculpt One, you so several repetitions of side squats with hammer curls, tap backs with triceps lifts, and side lunges with a move that looks like you are trying to start a lawn mower while holding a dumbbell.  I tried to keep up with how many repetitions she did per exercise, but I just couldn't keep track without taking a lot of time to stop and rewind the video.  One minute she is doing 4 reps, the next 9, the next 6, and the next 15.  Only when she is counting to 4 does she work all the moves and sides evenly.  I'm very disappointed because I think the cardio sculpt and ab moves are great. I've never seen some of them in other videos, and I think they are very effective.

I don't know what to say about this video because I really want to like it, but I just can't give it many stars due to the random number of repetitions throughout the entire DVD.  I don't feel the DVD is a total loss to me because I'm going to incorporate the cardio sculpt moves into my own routines.  However, I doubt most people that buy exercise videos have the time or inclination to do that.  It took me a while to decide to give it only 2 stars.  I would have rated it 5 stars, if the repetitions had been counted correctly.",1270944000,10,3631,4.333333333333333
