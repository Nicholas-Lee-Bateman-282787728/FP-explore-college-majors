The story begins with a view of a small city with large buildings in the background (movie sound stages). Another picture is in the bag, Roy returns to his horse ranch. A song greets Roy. There is news about the strangers grabbing wild horses from Roy's property. They ride to investigate, and there is a fight. The ""movie cowboy"" wins. The wild horses are freed to return to the open range. A stable in town buys and sells horses. Does hatred for dogs denote a villain? There is comedy in Roy's barn. [No cats there?] Roy meets Caroline, the new horse trainer (and relative of Cookie). ""She weighs a ton."" Ted and his dog visit, and find a home. There is a race between a long-legged horse and a short-legged dog. ""Pop"" Jordan smiles and smiles. Roy sings on the radio. Ted visits the barn and gets a surprise from the thieves. Trigger was lured from the barn. The ""smartest horse in the movies"" falls for an old, old trick. ""Famous Horse Missing.""

The kidnappers want $100,000 ransom in small bills. Roy suspects some local person did it. Would this world be better if everyone told the truth? [""What is truth?""] Roy sings again. A man enters the house to make a low bid. A shot from the outside interrupts the discussion. Next morning Roy picks up the money from the bank. A letter brings instructions for the ransom pay-off. The sheriff explains why they shouldn't pay - it would encourage more crime. There is another song. Will Cookie ""go Hollywood""? The payoff is made. A man gets this horse, he is chased and tries to hide. Meanwhile the other members of the gang have trouble getting Trigger back into hiding. Young Ted arrives to upset their plans. Roy and his men find what Tramp was hiding! Can Tramp lead them to Ted? ""Saddle up!"" Roy arrives and the shooting begins. Roy rescues Trigger and young Ted. Roy's men show up for a rescue. ""Pop"" learns he trusted a crook and killer. [There's more to go around when fewer share in the loot.] Roy catches up and knocks out the last man. There is a surprise at the end. There is a happy ending for the good guys. Ted will get an operation. [No Medicaid in those days.]

This modern western uses the classic themes of a prominent man in town who is head of a gang of crooks, the theft of horses, and the duplicity of some people. The appearance of a young boy and his dog should please the audience for its sympathy. The songs and comedy have become part of most western. [How do the good guys always know when it is time to show up for a rescue?]",1292976000,,2538,4.430406852248394

1213117,1,B00000FZXB,"I recently purchased several "" HAPPY TRAILS THEATER "" Roy Rogers movies on dvd & I'm now doubting my better judgement. It was the AUTHORIZED BY THE ROY ROGERS ESTATE & DIGITALLY RESTORED statements that motivated my purchase...PLEASE, DO NOT FALL for this gimmick advertising. Maybe THE ROY ROGERS ESTATE doesn't know any better...but it should!!!

This is an extremely heavily edited version of a very good Republic Western. The dvd case states approx. 65min. Roy & Dale yak with director William Whitney for at least 10min. of that time cutting the film length to under an hour.

Now I have nothing against Roy & Dale recalling old times, actually I like it, but not if it means I have to watch a choppy version of UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS to compensate for time loss??? on a dvd???

GOODTIMES VIDEO/DVD took an old TV-edited version of Roy & Dale's HAPPY TRAILS THEATER PROGRAM and slapped it onto a dvd without restoring all the missing parts that had been cut out for commercials...you can easily spot the commercial "" fades "".

The cuts & jumps were jarring & confusing...

Luckily I have a 20-MOVIE PACK of Roy Rogers films on 4-dvd's from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT that has a version of UNDER WESTERN STARS listing at 70min. I put this version on right after watching the HAPPY TRAILS version and I must say that results were astounding!!!

MILL CREEK's is most likely as complete a version as you will find. Right from the BEGINNING...HAPPY TRAILS jumps into Roy fighting make-believe on a movie set...MILL CREEK starts the picture off with a great establishing shot of what is most likely REPUBLIC STUDIOS before Roy's intro...& all through the MILL CREEK version you catch a second here, a minute there, several complete scenes here and there. All the songs are intact as well including Roy & THE PIONEERS singing "" DUST "" at Roy's coming home party ( Roy ends the song with his great line "" ...and may the good Lord take a likin' to you.""...which, of course is all missing from the HAPPY TRAILS version ). Another missing song, the theme title "" UNDER WESTERN STARS "" sung duet by Roy & Jane Frazee also appears in the MILL CREEK version. To cut the title theme song is a statement in itself as to HAPPY TRAIL's lack of care in product presentation!!!

As for what version "" LOOKS & SOUNDS BETTER "", you would have to be nit-picking to favor HAPPY TRAILS...both look fine for a Tru-Color film & the MILL CREEK version is just as acceptable.

For money value, the MILL CREEK 4-disc set is worth it alone for a MUCH MORE complete version of "" UNDER WESTERN STARS "" by about 20min & 2 songs.

However, MILL CREEK's version of "" LIGHTS OF OLD SANTA FE "" runs under 60min & is a cut version...so this is not a perfect world.

HAPPY TRAILS VERSION: 1 star.

MILL CREEK VERSION: 5 stars.

Compare them yourself, you'll see.",1179878400,,2825,4.572277227722772
1213118,4,B00000FZXB,"Roy Rogers a good cowboy.

Trigger is a good cowboy's horse.

California is a good location to film a cowboy and his horse.

California is a good place to sing and write cowboy songs

California is not a good place to steal a good cowboy's horse.

The Alpha Video DVD is an attempt at color and if you like brown it will look just fine.

Good songs, good fighting and plenty of wild shooting.

Cowboys riding real horses in the dirt and dust, so welcome to ""Under California Stars""

Enjoy a classic.",1163030400,,499,4.3478260869565215
1213119,2,B00000FZXB,"Be forewarned....the very opening of the movie on this DVD has been truncated. The source for these transfers is evidently a program hosted by Roy and Dale in their later years.

Secondly, the source is not good either. Roan Group did a much better job with their Roy Roger movie transfers.
