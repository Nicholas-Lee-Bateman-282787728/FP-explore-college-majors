8358931,5,B002A5EBSK,"One of the best C movies I've seen. Made me laugh so hard and so many horrible yet quotable lines. If you aren't looking for a decent plot but just something so ridiculous you can't believe they actually had a budget, this movie is well worth it. As the tagline says, ""You're in for a damn treat!""",1504828800,,297,4.228070175438597
8358932,3,B002A5EBSK,"It's pretty simple. A serial-killing cowboy named Roy Thompson -complete w/ the hat, boots, spurs, big-belt-buckle, and pickup truck- moseys into town. He starts a-killin' right away in grisly fashion. He picks up a girl, dismembers her, and goes out camping w/ her head. Meanwhile, we're introduced to the rural town-folk, none of whom has a measurable brainwave. The police are stumped as Roy hacks, stabs, and shoots his way through the local hillbilly population. Be prepared for blood, gore, full-frontal-female-nudity, idiot humor, and characters so astonishingly annoying that you'll rejoice w/ every homicide! Created w/ no discernible budget, COWBOY KILLER does have its moments. Roy is a fairly likeable fella, at least when he's not murdering people. Yeeee-Haaww!...",1378771200,,777,5.53781512605042
8358933,4,B002A5EBSK,"I'll admit that a combo of slasher film, comedy, and western is a weird one, but Cowboy Killer is entertaining. There are several quirky characters in this film that speak hilarious dialogue. Just don't rent or purchase this movie expecting a scary movie, because it's more a comedy than anything else. None of the death scenes are pulled off as good as they could have been, but I'm sure that has to do with the budget. For example, there's a scene at a rave that could have been a massacre, but it didn't happen. Paul Bailey is great as The Cowboy. Cowboy Killer isn't a great movie, but if you want to be entertained for an hour and twenty minutes, then you're in for a dang treat! Yee-Haw!!",1293062400,,694,4.4296875
8358934,3,B002A5EBSK,"Okay.  Don't watch this movie for good acting.  Don't watch it for a particularly well-written script or high budget effects either.  I can't completely explain why I liked this movie but as bizarre as it is I found myself laughing out loud several times.  I can't complain about a movie that does that.  It's gorey, shameless and often times baffling but you'll probably never see another movie like it.  It's not exactly  Cannes Film Festival material, but if you can appreciate a low-budget dark comedy/horror movie then as the Cowboy Killer would say ""you're in for a d*mn treat.""",1251072000,,584,4.838383838383838

Good Premise and a Murderous Cowboy.
