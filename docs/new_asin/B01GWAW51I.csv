7768019,4,B01GWAW51I,A cute kids' movie based in the mythos. Adult fans will have plenty to chuckle over. Despite a couple of other reviews there's no more real occultism in this than there is in Lovecraft - i.e. none.,1476921600,,197,4.351351351351352
7768020,3,B01GWAW51I,"Well. Definitely a child's movie....a very young child. I don't think this movie would hold the attention of anyone older than 5 or 6. So, if you're that age...great movie, if not, don't waste your money.",1476662400,,204,4.694444444444445
7768021,3,B01GWAW51I,"Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom is and animated feature based upon the graphic novel of the same name and is a somewhat whimsical look at the life of horror author H.P. Lovecraft as a child. The film has a very strong Tim Burton feel to its look and style. Young Howard Lovecraft is a typically precocious child who goes to visit his father one day in a local asylum, an unfortunate true fact of Lovecrafts actual father who would die in a mental institution. That night, Howard finds and reads from his fathers journal which is filled with mysterious signs and sigils. It opens a portal in his bedroom which whisks him off to an alternate dimension, the frozen world of Rlyeh.howard-1

He is immediately attacked by a monstrous creature that has an octopus-like head and wingsthe spitting image of Cthulhu, Lovecrafts signature character, one of the Great Old Ones, interdimensional cosmic deities who ruled the world long before man. However, after Howard helps the monster, the two become fast friends and the boy nicknames his new friend spot. The pair journey to the castle of Algid Bunk (Curtain) who explains that the eternal winter of the land is the result of a curse that can only be undone by locating the dreaded book of forbidden lore, The Necronomicon.

Howard and Spot now undertake a dangerous quest to retrieve the book which lies deep within caverns under a mountain and in possession of a horrific creature known as the Shoggoth (Ron Perlman). Howard and Spot have to somehow steal the book back from the creature but not everyone (or everything) is as it seems and some characters have sinister motives for wanting the Necronomicon found.

Its a bit hard to determine who this film is geared towards. Will Lovecraft purists be taken aback at the many liberties taken with the Cthulhu Mythos and seeing these terrible creatures of lore reduced to imaginative animated versions? Or will it appeal to those who look at it from purely an entertainment perspective, not worrying about how close it is to the source material? While I have read some Lovecraft I am certainly not an expert so I place myself into the latter category.

The fact of the matter is that the film industry has a horrible track record of adapting Lovecrafts works, releasing one bad low-budget disaster after another. Lovecrafts works seem to intimidate any Director worth his salt to bring to the big screen. So an animated film, even one that is not based on any Lovecraft stories is still a positive.

The voice cast is quite interestingthe veterans like Perlman, Curtain, Doug Bradley as Nyarlathotep, and Christopher Plummer as the narrator are a lot of fun. Kiefer OReilly is a little on the stiff side playing the young Howard but hes passable. The story tends to meander a bit in the first half of the film and I found myself nodding off at one point. The final third of the film has a much brisker pace. The main weakness of the film is its animation which simply isn't up to the par of other modern day animated films. Its 3D animation looks dated and flat. There isn't the depth of textures that we see even in some animated TV shows.

Still, if you're a Lovecraft fan or fan of weird horror in general there simply isn't a lot out there to choose from making this film a mild diversion.

7768022,2,B01GWAW51I,"Howard aka HP Lovecraft uses a book he got from his father to cross over into another realm and close the passages between their world and ours.

The film follows much of the historical data. Howard was from Providence, Rhode Island. His father Winfred was in a mental institution and died when Howard was eight. Lovecraft wrote as if our world is in constant battle with ancient evil forces. The film allows us to introduce the dark writings of Lovecraft's ancient demons to eight year old kids in a whimsical fashion, something someone more religious than I am might find very objectionable... yet conversely treating Lovecraft's work as a cartoon, might take the wind out of the sails.

The reason why I gave the film 2 stars has nothing to do with beliefs or the portrayal of Lovecraft, but on the entertainment value. Over half of the film was boring conversation and kid's games. The action wasn't great. Kiefer O'Reilly was less than acceptable as the voice of Lovecraft while they went all out with Ron Perlman, Christopher Plummer, and Doug Bradley for the support cast.

I like the idea and support cast, but thought the script and execution lacked.",1476489600,,1159,4.785

7768026,3,B01GWAW51I,"There's a fair amount of interesting art in this film, the story is okay, and there are some charming moments. Quite a fun idea to introduce the Cthulhu mythos to kids (Spot makes an adorable sidekick) but the age group this film seems likely to appeal to is far too young to read H.P. Lovecraft for many years. It would probably have been better to aim at an older or at least a wider audience. Perhaps the original graphic novel this film was based on was better.

The animation is low-budget and gives the film a stodgy feel, which is not helped by the fact that there seems to be a lot of talking vs action, and very little humor or real suspense. The main voice actor is a child, and not very expressive. About on the level of a Charlie Brown special voice actor. There are no truly scary moments. In fact, the opening scene in the asylum is likely the most disturbing part of the movie. Parents who are afraid of their young children being introduced to the basics of occultism will want to avoid this film, but it should be fine for anyone who just sees it as another fantasy movie.",1475020800,2,1089,4.338235294117647
7768027,4,B01GWAW51I,Cute little movie for kids if you want to introduce them into the legend of Chululu. The animation styling is very low quality compared to most children's movies now and days but it is definitely one of a kind. Not something I would recommend unless you are a true Lovecraft and want to have something the kids can watch as well as you. Especially if you don't want to approve of the occult. As for me I will be buying my daughter a Spot plush as advertised inside the DVD case.,1474934400,5,478,4.263736263736264

7768031,1,B01GWAW51I,"In and of itself, the film is not terrible. It feels like an attempt to capitalize on other films - ""ParaNorman"" and Disney's ""Frozen"" - while attempting to make creative new use of material by early 1900's author, H.P. Lovecraft. Its biggest drawback is the misuse of the licensed content (Cthulu and the Lovecraft mythos). The movie simply is not true to Lovecraft's work, and this may turn off viewers who approach the film expecting Lovecraftian elements. Unfortunately, the Lovecraftian touches seem to be pasted on as a hasty afterthought.",1487721600,2,545,5.066666666666666
7768032,2,B01GWAW51I,"The animation is...not the best. The acting is...very OK, though the main character and his 'friend' do alright, and Ron Perlman shines as the voice of the 'shoggoth' (not really a shoggoth - it is funny and strange that they describe one exactly as Lovecraft did, then render something completely different - I suspect their budget was not up to it). I was prepared to forgive all that, but the story is kind of a mess, and the end feels like a Saturday morning cartoon, complete with cliche ending. At least they didn't pull that ""it was all a dream"" crap.
I gather that this is based on a book (presumably in the same way that a stick figure is 'based on' Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man). I'm reading the book now, hoping for better results.
This isn't the worst Lovecraft adaptation I've seen, but considering the competition, that's not saying much.",1486684800,4,848,4.622516556291391
7768033,3,B01GWAW51I,The movie kept my attention but I feel like it was only for the love of lovecraft.

The animation is BAD, the dialog (and I use the term lightly) is something that could have been written by a 6 year old. Fight scenes are easy if the bad guys just stand there and shout or stumble slowly towards the ""action"". Seriously disappointing, and if you make it to the credits you'll find out why. It seems the writer, producer, and most of the case are related. As for Ron Perlman, I can only assume they used blackmail to get him on board.",1477180800,2,586,4.435185185185185
7768046,4,B01GWAW51I,An H.P. Lovecraft Movie for Kids. Its About Freaking time we started converting a a young age.,1477094400,,94,4.588235294117647
7768047,4,B01GWAW51I,"A lovecraft film for kids? Huh? Nope, it just don't add up!
Well, that was what I thought. But being a die-hard Lovecraft addict I thought to myself ""It couldn't be as bad as ""The Last Lovecraft"" or the 1980s treatments of ""Herbert West - Reanimator"". At least Ron Perlman is in it. Despite the cheapish animation, ""Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom"" is actually not bad. If you look at its intent, which is to introduce a new generation to the incredible worlds of H.P. Lovecraft, it's actually quite brilliant. Specifically it introduces them to the Necronomicon, Cthulhu (who in this story is also known as Chu Chu Hamong and Spot (really!?)) and there's even an attempt at a Shoggoth. Beyond this the story draws more heavily on the less-well-known Dreamlands stories for its flavor. The plot is completely original to the film, though elements will be familiar to fans.
Briefly, young Howard has inherited a book which his father wrote just before going insane. The book opens a portal to a frozen world where Howard befirends a strange monster (Cthulhu) whom he calls ""Spot"" because he can't pronounce Chu Chu Hamong. Young Howard turns out to be a prophesied savior who would rid the land of ice but to do this, he has to defeat the dreaded Shoggoth.
The story is told well and what little violence there is is tempered by what comes off as deliberately drawn out slapstick. In fact much of what makes this look like a cheaply-animated film was probably mostly intentional in order to allow younger viewers to enjoy it. Despite this, however, it still has a PG-13 rating which, for once, I think is undeserved. I saw more disturbing things in Saturday Morning Cartoons. And lest you think I'm making light, there is a Cthulhu Plushy toy available! And I thought a huggable Rancor (Star Wars) was taking things a bit far!",1477094400,7,1833,4.73125

8763653,5,B01GWAW51I,"It's a kids movie based on Lovecraft's writing. People calling this the worst animated film ever are just being dramatic and whining for the sake of whining. It's a cute movie and there are some funny Easter eggs from major science fiction and comic book movies if you pay attention. My son and I both enjoyed it, so I gave it 5 Stars just to offset the one-star Bandits. Honestly, I would have given it four stars, but the one star ratings are just from people who were expecting too much or just like to write reviews thrashing the work they could never do. I am a big fan of HP Lovecraft's stories and I love it when they actually make a good film adaptation. I can't watch From Beyond with my son, but I can watch these movies. I'm hoping they make more than just two films to spite the complainers.",1527552000,,803,4.2894736842105265

As a fan of Lovecraft, I at least knew what they were referring to.  At any rate, its cute.  But.  Im not at all certain that Lovecrafts work could ever be accused of being cute, but there it is.

8763659,4,B01GWAW51I,"H.P. Lovecraft story elements in a child's movie? Yes!  And it works, better than any live-action movie based on his works that I've seen.  I watched this with a group of the following ages: 5, 10, 11, 42, 43, 45.  Out of those, two of the adults (including me) know H.P.L.'s works in detail.  The 10 and 11 year old loved it without knowing anything about his writing, they laughed and sat on the edge of their seats at times.  The two of us who have read his works thought it was hilarious and had to explain the in-jokes.  The 5 year old and unknowing adult were amused but no more than that.  Overall a good tale with enough of a hero's journey to keep us interested.  I see all the comments about the animation, but seriously, get past that - the animation serves the story and does a solid job.  HPL was no Faulkner or Hemingway, his brilliance was in his ideas.  This cartoon is the same, look to the story and the laughs not the excellence of the artwork.  I write this assuming most people who watch it will have some familiarity with his writing, or a friend who will explain it.  I'm simply blown away that this even got funded and made, I hope for much more.

If you know nothing of Howard P. Lovecraft, this story takes some darker elements than you usually see in modern cartoons and turns them into a quest with comedic elements.  Think ""Army of Darkness"" if you know that, but for kids.  There will be parts to the story that go right over your head without the background knowledge, but I watched the kids carefully and it certainly didn't phase them, they laughed through it anyway.  While many kid's movies these days seem to have an element to appeal to kids, and an element to appeal to adults, this one has them for kids and then HPL fans.  Overall a good fun time.",1514937600,,1787,4.3343373493975905
