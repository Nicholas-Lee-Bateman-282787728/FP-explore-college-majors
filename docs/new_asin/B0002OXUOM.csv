It is based on the Yin/Yang principles of the Taoist Temples - slip away from the incoming force and re-appear in the opponent's unprotected areas.  (Fighting without struggle).  The techniques are derived from the many wild animals living near the Taoist Temples and include punching, kicking, grappling, groundfighting, joint locks and pressure points.  It is the fighting system of Tai-chi-Chuan - the ""Grand Ultimate Martial Art.""

This DVD explores how to apply these principles to sparring with another person.  You learn to flow around the incoming force and deliver your own devastating blows, specifically using punching techniques.  Each sparring technique is shown, explained and demonstrated in combat.
