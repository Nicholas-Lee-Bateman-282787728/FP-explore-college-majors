8649896,4,B00JDCOUG6,"A brief review of Vol. 1 thru 3 of Mark Hatmakers Street Self-Defense System. Hatmaker is a smart fit guy that understands martial arts
better than most and has see thru  the BS, the silliness, the foolishness, the filler and fluff - as well as having a clear understanding of
the difference between sport and real deal self defense . Vol. 1 - 3 are several dvds and several hours of quality instruction/demo
covering the subject matter better IMO than any others I've watched and I've watched many over the years. Before I ever read a
MA/self-defense book, viewed a MA/self-defense video I experienced much of the subject matter on the ""mean streets"" so I came
to the martial arts many years ago already knowing more than a thing or two about how to really survive/solve/win. Best purchase
his book No Second Chance too. No I have never met, trained with Mark Hatmaker  and I didn't get these dvds free to review.",1454457600,,914,4.635802469135802
