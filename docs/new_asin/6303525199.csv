7850927,1,6303525199,"This movie is so boring and pointless.  Nothing happens to move the plot forward, and there's no tangible antagonist.  The few action scenes there are are decent, but they do nothing for the story.  The big finale consists  of a girl trying not fall out of her mech--how lame is that?  There's so  much talking, and nothing ever happens.  The sequel to this movie has  philisophical content in the discussions, so at least there was SOME reason  to listen to the dialogue.  In this movie, you have to listen to two hours  of crap to find out some guy is pissed at Tokyo.  It doesn't matter at all,  and there's no reason to care.  Movies like Akira and Ghost in the Shell  have slow spots as well, but they are short, and animated in such a way  that they remain interesting.  Not to mention the fact that their  discussions have a POINT.  If you want to watch a giant mech movie, watch  Evangelion or wait for Gasaraki to come out in the US.  This movie isn't  worth the tape it's printed on.",961200000,2,993,4.34065934065934
