3748390,5,B001PMICH0,"Well, there really is only one word to describe this 7-DVD set: FANTASTIC.

You get 6 DVDs full of music, one bonus disc with interviews, the (almost) hour-long soundcheck, and all of that in a beautiful box (not like the one from the Roxy release) with a 50 page booklet and a set of photographs. What more could you ask for?

If I could I'd give this set 10 stars ...",1239753600,7,369,4.183098591549296
3748391,5,B001PMICH0,"Just got the box set in the mail today.  Much thought obviously went into the packaging...comes in a durable case and includes extras like Clifford Ball stamps and postcards with pictures from the shows as well as a little storybook about the festival, the first of its kind.  This event set the stage for future multi-day festivals in the spirit of Phish such as The Great Went, Lemonwheel, and Big Cypress, where fans create their own community as they gather in large numbers to witness live music in some of its finest form.  The setlists from both days are remarkable and capture the band during a very comfortable stretch of their career, before the pressure of touring and putting out fresh studio material caused them to lose momentum and become at odds with one another.  The recent Hampton shows, however, demonstrate Phish's ability to pick up where they left off and continue to deliver impressive performances while having fun playing together again.",1236643200,14,963,4.925925925925926
3748392,5,B001PMICH0,"My copy arrived a few hours ago, been jamming ever since. This is a great release. The box is well made, not cheap like some of the others. The photos, stamps etc are really nice. Audio/video quality is 100%. I got mine from Phish,com got the shirt, magnets all the little stuff. The music will jam. This is a real deal, time to jam. See you in Asheville this Summer.

3748393,5,B001PMICH0,"This is an excellent production and release by Phish (my favorite of all CD and DVD releases).  The shows themselves are amazing.  Pre-hiatus Phish 1.0 at it's best.  David Bowie 1st set is downright ridiculous.  The band was one fire this weekend.

and the bonus disc is amazing.  The pickup truck jam.  Wow.  All the little extras packaged in (the glider, wristbands, stamps, postcards ... top notch quality.)  Even the package is innovative.

The sound quality is superb.  I was shaking the house down last night.

For $49.99 this is a STEAL.  I paid full retail from Phish.com direct for $89.99.  Still amazing.

Don't hesitate to get this one if you are a fan.",1236038400,5,665,4.7105263157894735
3748394,5,B001PMICH0,"Phish fans across the universe have seen the many You Tube videos of footage of this festival and now its time for the whole show from 1st set to the last and then some. You get all 6 sets plus footage of the sound check, and many more. Don't trust Phish Dry goods. Amazon is cheaper. I highly anticipate the arrival of this DVD set. This is going to be worth a lot more then what you pay for im sure. Will we see The Great Went or Big Cypress? Lets hope so.",1232582400,2,458,3.935483870967742

3748427,5,B001PMICH0,"As a fan since 1990, I can get kind of snooty about the ups and downs of the band's different eras, and lately I've been too grown-up busy with family and work to keep track of the band.  My favorite years for Phish for a long time have been '90-'96, (although I'm getting fond of 2009-, and am pretty impressed with 2013). I felt that a live slide began in '97, and I dismissed some of their 1996 live stuff as going that direction, and stuck with mostly '95 and earlier.  Anyway, before heading to the Gorge from out East to see them summer 2013 (great first night!) I decided to sample some of their recent stuff. At work I have access to a music service with a groovy shark in its logo, and I quickly came across the audio from The Clifford Ball in 1996, which I'd never heard.  So for hours on end at my desk at work, I listened in.

The first song, set, and night impressed the heck out of me right from the start. Set after set just delivered mind-blowing quality and renditions, and pretty quickly I concluded I had to buy the CD.  So, over to Amazon I came to find the CD... which, it turns out, does not exist:  Only the DVD exists.  Sticker shock set in, and I ended up listening to the audio version for another day at work, and any doubts about $ were drowned out by the desire to actually see this go down on my 5.1 55"" system at home.

Let it suffice to say that the video really compliments the audio, although at first I had a slight pang of disappointment:  ""Ohh... right... This was back in '96... Of course its not the 16:9 1080p HD we're all spoiled with these days"".  But that lasted maybe 20 seconds as the show energy kicks in and it goes full screen right from time the crowd sees them on stage.  From the first chord you  see and hear that the boys are super-juiced to be doing the Clifford ball, their first mega weekend concert.

First night is hands down one of my top 5 favorite shows now, and I'm glad to have it in 5.1 audio and Vid.  Second night is still great, but lacks just a touch of the energy of night one.  That's nit-picky, though, because it's still better than a ton of their live stuff, and the sound quality is so solid.

While it is great for an experienced, long-time fan, this is the perfect vehicle for those new to Phish looking to actually give the band a fair shake, or for those phans looking to get friends and family to better understand the band. Like any complex act, Phish music does not always make a ton of sense at first listen.  A few runs through this DVD, and you'll get a real sense for what Phish really was and still is. (IMO, skip ALL live 1998-2004 until you're hooked.)

As for epic, I will quote my 8-year old son who watched his first-ever PHISH set with me during my first watch through SET I, spoken while he was entranced amid the Esther instrumental, and during Trey's Esther solo:  ""He's doing THAT with a guitar?!?""  His confirming that I'm not stark raving mad by still being amazed by this band after so many years was worth the DVD price alone!

All said - this DVD is simply stunning, even for a guy with 23+ years and numerous lives shows (early year tiny venues, first large venues, New Years runs, comebacks and farewells) in all eras under his belt.  Its fresh yet nostalgic, and made seeing them at the Gorge this summer that much more enjoyable, especially seeing how much the boys are back in good (albeit different) form!",1377820800,11,3412,4.281931464174455

This production is wonderful.  The video and audio are as good as the playing!  I can only hope that the band will release this quality of DVD from 1997 and 1998 as well!
If the Beatles had remained friends then they would have put something as good as this out as well!  Please get this DVD set as it will BLOW YER MIND...Thanks Guys!!!",1280880000,,395,4.171052631578948

3748433,5,B001PMICH0,"My wife bought me this box of wonder, because she is possible the best wife a man could ask for on this earth, but I deter. I own 4 Phish DVD's (including this one) and I have to say it is by far the best one.  The main reason is because it is an entire 2 day show nestled into 6 discs (not including the bonus disc which makes 7 discs).  Another reason is because there were some great songs performed during this concert (not that Phish, during this time, had any bad songs) including Haley's Comet, Esther, Fluffhead, and Harpua.  Those are just a few of the many great songs you will get to see/hear on this DVD.  The band also plays a 4-5 song acoustic set on stage in one of the sets (I believe it is the 2nd set of the first day).  The footage mainly concentrates on the band and you get to see a lot of the magic that happens on stage between the four when they are deep into their ""zones"" which is pretty cool; I mean I enjoy seeing some of the ""kooky"" hippies fried out of their minds and bustin' a jig, but I really enjoy seeing the intense concentration of the band members while they sort of feed off each other (musically, not cannibalistically come on folks!).  The DVD set also comes with some pretty cool postcards and booklet that has quite a few pictures from the concert in inside.  The only downfall of the DVD is you have to see Trey being an [...] to his fans towards the end; when a fan sneaks up on stage to giving one of his heroes (Trey) a hug (pretty much thanking him for a great time) and all Trey can do is push him away like he's a leper, and wait on the security guards to pull the guy off stage.  Trey also makes some sort of snide remark about the guy... but anyways;  I highly recommend you buy this DVD set it is worth the money and it will def. get your Phish fix if you chillin in your house and thinking about all those wonderful Phish shows you attending back in the day.",1254268800,,1912,4.10455764075067
