About the disc: Nice video and audio. Pristine sound and a very clear image, you can tell it was recorded on full HD cameras.
Love this disc!",1389744000,3,337,4.044776119402985
8592455,5,B00DE5W9XY,"This is a very fine disc and more or less completes Mahler's important works on quality Blu-ray releases. The Swiss are on top form here, done up to the nines like a dog's dinner and all the technical aspects ticking over like a Swiss watch! The camera work, picture and sound and the orchestral playing are demonstration quality. Neeme Jrvi is 76 now and has lost a bit of his flamboyancy but none of his attention to detail and draws out the most beautiful sound. A minor oddity is that whilst the European language subtitles are possibly just a bit too small, the Japanese subtitles are much larger and very easy to read. Many regard Das Lied von der Erde as Mahler's greatest work and the final song: Der Abschied is deeply moving. The issue here is often very personal - baritone or mezzo. On DVD there is a quite magical rendering by Semyon Bychkow and Waltraud Meier that for me sets a standard that is perfection. Meier's facial control and vocal genius has to be witnessed to be believed. Thomas Hampson is a fine singer but is up against the angels with Meier! I thought Paul Groves was superb and better than Torsten Kerl on the Meier disc. Of course Bychkow does not have the technical brilliance of this disc but his lugubrious conducting suits the work perfectly and he also gets some wonderful sound. This new release is a beautiful disc and if Meier's recording did not exist it should satisfy everyone but Meier is incomparable and cannot be bettered.",1375833600,9,1468,4.606870229007634
