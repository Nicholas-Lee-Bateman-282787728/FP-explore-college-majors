8282471,5,B001BADMZI,"Rob has a straight forward approach to playing metal guitar and it translates directly to the audience of the DVD. I bought this DVD about a year ago and am a beginner to intermediate player. The DVD covers a wide range of topics from riffing, soloing, to song writing. Rob teaches you several fundamental based licks throughout the DVD and it builds into a jam session where the user plays a complete song. Rob teaches you some parts of a few Chimaira songs as an added bonus. Honestly when I watch most instructional DVDs there is a huge disconnect for me between when the instructor plays it slow and then full speed. Rob is able to teach the lick at an appropriate tempo as to when you go to full speed, with some practice you will get it and not just be scratching your head as to what he did.",1418256000,,798,4.326666666666667
8282472,4,B001BADMZI,"Rob shows you some cool riffs and stuff from some chimaira tunes. It's  a  cool way to get a few new ideas, but like anyinstructional dvd, it's up to you to work at it. Being as I own many in this series, I have to admit that this one isn't one of my favorites.",1378598400,,261,3.814814814814815
