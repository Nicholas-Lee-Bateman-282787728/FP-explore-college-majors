7996208,4,B0000A5BW3,An oldie but goodie.  Good overview of John Shaw's shooting program.,1453075200,,68,5.181818181818182
7996209,4,B0000A5BW3,"In this video John Shaw demonstrates the advantages of firing guns smoothly and efficiently rather than in a rapid rush movement to shoot.  He uses the weapon's recoil time interval to prepare for the next shot to fire or to point to the next target at which to shoot.  This involves control of the weapon's recoil, efficient use of the recoil time interval and economy of movement by the shooter and proper, efficient shooting positions to eliminate time wasted in inefficient shooting habits.

I agree with the previous reviewer of this DVD that there is not enough detail in the film.  But no instructor is perfect.  I don't think that John Shaw and the instructors he works with to teach are the best teachers nor even near being the best.  But, I did learn a few little things by watching and listening to them in this video DVD.

The previous reviewer of this DVD seems to think that because John Shaw and the other instructors with whom he works are speaking to a class and not to the camera, the viewer of this DVD can't learn much of value.  I can't disagree more.  You can see demonstrations.  You can hear the instructors.  You can imitate their actions with your own weapon to try what they are demonstrating.  The previous reviewer's reasoning assumes that observers can't learn anything unless they are present and active participants.  If that was true, no video instruction would worth anything.  Furthermore, if that was true, we would learn nothing in any class even if we were in attendance unless the instructor was directing his attention to each individual in the class.  Seems to be an absurd assertion to me.

But, the DVD and John Shaw's instruction could have been improved to maintain its value to the viewer.
I think that there are too many scenes in the video that are not related to the topic: scenes of SWAT police and military special forces training in other disciplines: hand to hand combat, attack dog training, running an obstacle course,  audio on crime and gun casualty statistics, and even a preacher praying.  All of this was not related to the topic of how to train to use a pistol in combat.  Many of the scenes look like they came out of the ""COPS"" TV show.  Some guys might like to watch all this stuff.  I felt that it was a waste of time and video footage.

Over all, the video is worth watching and does not cost as much as some other videos on handgun use.

The video extra in which Tom Campbell of Team Smith & Wesson demonstrates how to control pistol recoil in order to shoot at a target with a sequence of rapid shots while staying on target is excellent.

People who are thinking about buying a semi-automatic handgun but don't know which handgun is right for them should watch the extra videos on this DVD on selecting a pistol.  These video extras examine 10 criteria for selecting handguns based on the handgun's features and type of ammunition rounds used in handguns.

John Shaw also instructs in a DVD called Combat Shotgun Seminar and he appears in video extras on the video,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Navy-Seal-Tactical-Shotgun-For-Self-Defense/dp/B0000A5BW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Navy Seal * Tactical Shotgun For Self-Defense</a>&nbsp;in which he demonstrates shotgun speed shooting and use of an MP-5 assault rifle.

7996210,2,B0000A5BW3,"The film features John Shaw, and some other Mid-south institute trainers teaching a shooting class. The camera is a bystander, and the training is not directed to the camera / viewer, but rather to the class Shaw is instructing. The result of this is that you really don't get proper instructing, but only presentation of the techniques and drills Shaw is using. During the whole instruction, Shaw speaks directly to the camera only once. There are parts of an interview added, where Shaw explains some things that were not covered in the film (they propably were handled in the shooting class, but were left out of the film).
The film is more like a presentation of some shooting drills and techniques, and a commercial of Mid-South institute, rather than a proper training film.
The picture quality is good, exept that sometimes the camera is zooming to a detail, when it should shoot a bigger picture. The sound is mushy on some instances.
In conclusion, this is not a very good film. There are some good points made, but as the instruction is not directed to the camera, from time to time you have a hard time grasping them. And without the hands-on training the shooting class attendees receive, there is not enough detail in the film.
Run time: 40 minutes
My DVD disc included 5 extras, run times ranging from 6 to 9 minutes each, subjects covering issues on gun and calibre selection, and some marksmanship basics. One of the extras was of exellent quality, otherwise they were average. The rating is for the feature film only, with extras the rating would be 3 stars.",1066608000,19,1575,4.7309090909090905
