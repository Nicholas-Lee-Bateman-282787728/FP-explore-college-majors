It is a great pleasure to see Master Chen Xiaoxing in action and have him be the instructor for the video. I wouldn't exactly recommend this to a begginer, but for intermediate and advanced students who have a firm grasp on Chen Taiji fundamentals, this video is an excellent resource.",1221004800,2,454,4.617283950617284
