1978078,4,B0001906VI,"For anyone who has seen Space Jams, unless your age 16 or under, Looney Tunes: Back In Action is better, funnier, and more true to the spirit of our WB friends.
There was, in my opinion, only one really good scene in Space Jams. The scene where Bugs and Daffy go to the real world. Looney Tunes took that great scene and ran with it.
I've always said that these were great characters but they needed new material. Space Jams was, for the most part, just a rehash of all their old routines. Well, in Looney Tunes: Back In Action they finally got new bits and their great!
I took my daughter to see Looney Tunes: BIA. She was not a fan of Bugs and the gang when we walk into the theater. She WAS when we left. She even went back a week later to see it again.
I hope they keep writing new scripts and making new movies. If they do, I'll be there.",1077753600,2,843,4.0843373493975905
1978079,1,B0001906VI,"I've read other reviews on Amazon, oh pleasee this movie didn't deserve it. Compared to Space Jam (which is out 1996)  , Looney Tunes Back in Action is nothing.
I must admit that the movie animation technology is the best though. The human and cartoon character blended PERFECTLY.
But The storyline and the acting is crap. Its only worth the for the animation . .",1077580800,4,363,4.584615384615384
1978080,5,B0001906VI,"What might have happened if, back in the day, the heads at WB had let the cartoon dept make a full feature, with no restrictions?  They could very well have come up with something like ""Back In Action"", lampooning everything imaginable, with an outlandish plot not unlike Marvin the Martian's attempts to blow up the Earth.
Of course, technology of the time would have kept them from effectively blending humans in the cartoon world so seamlessly, so they would have made up new characters instead.  Can you imagine what Steve Martin's villainous character would have been?  Well... ya hafta employ humans somewhere these days... :)
This was a heckuva movie, a major improvement on Space Jam, and maybe better than Roger Rabbit.  Can't wait for the DVD!",1076889600,4,753,4.905511811023622
1978081,4,B0001906VI,"Amazingly, ""Looney Tunes - Back in Action"" manages to capture the zany, ""we'll-make-fun-of-ANYTHING"" humor of the classic cartoons. It's got the wisecracks and the anarchy. There are setpieces (the chase through the Louvre is a classic), kidding of pc sensitivities (such as why Yosemite Sam's henchmen won't throw the dynamite out the window during a car chase through Las Vegas), a great jab at movie product placement (kudos to the company that let themselves be used for this!), jokes about classic horror films (""Them!"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" for two) and so on. The whole cast of toons is on hand, seamlessly combined with live actors (even the casting is a joke sometimes -- check out the Acme board of directors). Don't ask if the plot makes sense (it doesn't); just sit back and laugh.",1073520000,4,808,4.905109489051095

1978122,5,B0001906VI,"A seamless mix of real actors and cartoon characters  by seamless I mean you could seriously not tell that all was not happening in the same place at the same time. How did they do that scene with Daffy and the fire extinguisher foam? It looked so real. If I were from a hundred years ago and saw this movie I would think it all really happened, except that my mind would have been blown trying to figure out how. Now I can just accept that it is CG and animation, but wow. The acting was great  best I have ever seen Brendan Fraser. and Jenna Elfman was so good in her role. I will not spoil the plot by even revealing who played the Evil Antagonist, but he was perfect, not to mention the clever evil plot itself.  While fast paced and overblown, since after all it was one big cartoon, there were many subtle jokes.  Why do so many movies that use CG make everything look monochromatic and bluish, but this movie was able to pull off full blown color of the highest degree? Overall, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1451952000,,1034,4.207070707070707

1978182,4,B0001906VI,"This idea of mixing cartoon characters with live action has been done several times before, it does make good entertainment for the kids.  They seem to love it.  All the Looney Tune characters make cameos backing up the big stars Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as they aid Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman in rescuing Fraser's superstar actor father (who is a real super agent) Timothy Dalton and finding the Blue Monkey Gemstone and saving the world.  Steve Martin is funny as the head of ACME corporation who is going to use the stone to make everyone else monkeys.  For adults there are a lot of insider movie jokes slipped in.  In one scene, which Joan Cusack steals as ""Mother"" the head of Area 52, they have a lab scene in which adults who loved those hokey 50's sci fi flicks will get a kick out of the creatures which are all out of the cheesy 50's flicks.  All kinds of them from Robbie The Robot to the Robot-Gorilla are there.  This was a good humorous and entertaining flick worth a tongue in cheek watch.",1424563200,,1011,4.4324324324324325
1978183,2,B0001906VI,"Looney Tunes: Back in Action, is a very dull movie I really don't care for. I don't even want to sound mean-spirited towards it, because Im a huge fan of other movies that share the same premise like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Space Jam. The idea behind Looney Tunes: Back in Action is not anymore ridiculous than any other movie that combines animation with live-action. However, during its release they marketed it as the must-see tribute to the timeless cartoon characters, but the passion just isn't here.

The story behind Looney Tunes: Back in Action is about Daffy Duck being disgruntled with his Hollywood career because hes starting to think everyone loves Bugs Bunny more than him. Truthfully, Daffy Ducks case is very sympathetic. Some Looney Tunes fans have probably never wondered how Daffy must think of himself in this sense, but this movie is much too goofy and carefree to really emphasis this serious character dilemma. Thats partly the reason this movie is not that good.

But after Daffy Duck caused enough trouble and ropes a stuntman into it named D.J. Drake (played by Brendan Fraser) the two of them get fired. However, this is the start of a whole new adventure, as the chairman of the ACME corporation has an evil scheme to find a magical diamond that turns people into monkeys who will work for him, just so he can turn them back into humans so they can buy the merchandise they helped him make.

.... ._.

This setup is stupid! I have no hesitation saying it. One of this movies biggest problems is making all the human characters behave like they are cartoons with cartoonish motives instead of real people. That being said, the movie wouldnt be quite so bad if it were 100 percent animated, but our emotional connection to all the characters is very weak. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Judge Doom had an interesting evil scheme and he was scary. In Space Jam, they modeled their villain after Danny Devito who was very intimidating. But the ACME chairman in Looney Tunes: Back in Action is nothing but goofy comic relief. As such, we watch the movie like there is no clear or present threat.

Although I know this movie is trying to be a tribute to the Looney Tunes, and maybe not an edgy or mature kids movie, this is still a pretty sucky tribute. Drake begins an adventure with Daffy Duck because he believes his father is in danger; slowly learning overtime that his father was a secret agent all along who was trying to stop this villains conspiracy. Meanwhile, Bugs Bunny and the studio executive, Kate Houghton, realize the Looney Tunes are not the same without Daffy Duck so set out searching for him and get roped into the adventure as well. Just for reference, I think this story is poking fun at the stupidity of Warner Brothers themselves and the bad decisions they make.

But one of the worst ways this movie pays tribute to the Looney Tunes is by making Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam and Willie Coyote into bad guys. Dont get me wrong, because I know they are antagonists in the original series. But at the same time, we enjoyed these characters for the laughs they provided, and their motives were not very complicated either. Elmer Fudd is supposed to be a humble sports man, but in this movie hes working for diabolical world-conquering villains for seemingly no reason. Willie Coyote isn't supposed to be a villain at all. Hes just an animal who is hungry for roadrunners. In this movie, hes so bad at being a villain the heroes are hardly even aware of him. The only character I probably have no complaint against is maybe Marvin the Martian, because his goal was always to destroy the Earth, and his motives haven't changed too much in this movie. But the point is, Im surprised there isn't a big cartoon civil war breaking out because the Looney Tunes are in the same boat, whether they know it or not, and Im surprised they cant find a reason to unite for a common goal. I mean... off screen, do they go back to making their animated shorts after this movies over with no hard feelings?

One of the biggest differences between this movie and those other classics, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Space Jam, is that Looney Tunes: Back in Action doesnt even pay tribute to anything that makes the audience feel connected to it. Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a tribute to film noir detective movies and did this very well. Space Jam was a tribute to basketball, and both these movies took these subjects very seriously. These subjects provided the conflict for those movies that made us enjoy them. Looney Tunes: Back in Action, has a very complicated setup about spies and conspiracies, but threats them more as a joke than something to be understood and appreciated. Seriously, I wouldnt mind combining Looney Tunes with spies, if the spies weren't acting like Looney Tunes themselves.

The only thing that could maybe save this movie is probably the comedy, but even that falls short. As Ive said, its not very entertaining watching humans acting like cartoon characters, but Brendan Fraser and Kate Houghton aren't very good either as the straight-people who are doing double takes every time they realize the absurdity of the situations they are in. Its almost as if they don't realize humans coexist with cartoons in this movie. Most of the jokes are build up that leads to a punch line thats not funny. Some of the jokes are just downright strange and out of the blue. Not to mention, most of the Looney Tunes make only a short cameo appearance and don't contribute their unique sense of humor while they're at it. They simply appear, and thats it.

If this movies goal was to be the ultimate Looney Tunes tribute, I would have loved a movie I could at least take seriously. The humor and comedy of the original shorts is still there, but a feature-length film does need a plot that keeps us invested all the way through. But Looney Tunes: Back in Action is a horrible mess that has no passion or direction. Space Jam was a silly movie, but at least it was good. But Looney Tunes: Back in Action is a bad follow up, and the production of this movie was reportedly handled very badly. It shows, because I do not believe this is either a good movie or even a fun movie worth seeing.",1423785600,,6223,4.619349005424954

1978433,3,B0001906VI,"Watched it right after Roger Rabbit; somehow felt like a spinoff, that was nice. Well, what got me to watch this as an adult when I'd never seen it as a child was several online polls that indicated that in modern times, Daffy ranks higher that Bugs in popularity polls by a landslide, so the first scene felt ironic, but I think that's what the movie's playing on, I mean Daffy was also the star of Quackbusters & Fantastic Island. It's a very VERY Meta comedy that pokes fun of how watered down & PC cartoons have become overtime. There's also a 4th wall breaking product placement joke.

Considering the date this was made, we were probably all a little disappointed when The Warners didn't pop out of the water tower, yet somehow Hanna Barbera characters & & Disney references poke their noses in. Speaking of Hanna Barbera characters, the first actually funny scene is 8-9 minutes in; Porky & Speedy are drinking orange cocktails & whining about how much political correctness sucks, quickly followed by Shaggy & Scooby b**ching out an actor for his portrayal in the live action movies & threaten to go after him if he messes up in the sequel, then bugs tells Kate that he has nothing to say to someone who doesn't approve of his crossdressing. Lastly there's the chase scene through the paintings in the Louvre.

For a movie where real life & cartoons coexist, my suspension of disbelief didn't ring any alarms until I saw the place Brendan Fraser was living in on his paltry security guard salary. To my surprise, this is actually addressed. I mentioned Roger Rabbit earlier; well Brendan & Daffy definitely develop a Roger-&-Elliott-like relationship. ""You know, I'm getting REALLY tired of throwing you out of the car"" may be Fraser's funniest line ever, while Sam's was refurring to a Nascar vehicle as a clown car.

The movie really can't decide if it wants to be for kids or adults; Honestly I don't think the painful predictable kid-friendly slapstick mixes very well with the soft ribaldry. When you try to appeal to the lowest common denominator instead of a narrow target audience, it loses something. Most of the actors are incredibly camp, so props to Fraser & Elfman for trying to play the movie as straight as possible while Steve Martin puts on the worst performance of his life. & the movie does display some balls in it's comedy with a little noncartoon violence, mild T&A, & referencing things children won't have seen, like Psycho or The Pit & the Pendulum. An annoyance is that Bugs & Daffy really do take a backseat to what is really a Brendan Fraser spy film.

There's some interesting dated pop culture references, if you keep your eyes on the background; Forbidden Planet (Robbie), Dr Who (Daleks), Matilda. Might as well add in that the animation is pretty good & some of the toon-real world interaction are pretty sweet.

The Chairmen character is very poorly written & really drags the whole whole show down in the 2ed half. This has to be a black stain of Steve Martin's resume. Also in the second half, Bugs & Daffy are reduced to tag-alongs, kinda like how the actual Transformers took a back seat to Shia LaBeouf in a movie that was supposed to be about robots.",1344470400,,3198,4.683274021352313
1978434,3,B0001906VI,"Since I'm only a casual ""Looney Tunes"" fan, I can't judge how this movie compares to ""classic"" Looney Tunes, like a hardcore fan could.  But I can say that for someone who's at least familiar with Bugs, Daffy, and the other `Toons, and who likes cartoony, childish humor, this movie will probably be enjoyable.

This movie is nothing epic or super-special, nor does it try to be.  The plot (or what passes for one) builds up, one silly twist after another.  What starts as another petty competition between Bugs and Daffy for the spotlight leads to the them joining two human protagonists on a James Bond-like spy adventure, to save the human race from a corrupt Acme corporation.  The devious plot they must stop? The Acme CEO (Steve Martin) plans to transform the human race into monkeys, so they'll work mindlessly in his factories to make products...and then turn them back into humans, so they'll then buy all those products.  What can I tell you, if you want Shakespeare, go watch ""Hamlet.""

Bugs and Daffy are the only two Looney Tunes to have regular roles in the film. Most of the other well-known Looney Tunes show up for one or two scenes each, as operatives for the villain, trying to catch or kill Bugs and Daffy in their own unique ways: Mavin the Martian battles them in space, Elmer Fudd chases them through paintings in a museum, and we finally learn where Wile E. Cyote gets all of his exotic weapons.  The other, less famous Toons are given memorable cameos:  Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzalez lament over a drink about how Political Correctness has stunted their acts; Pepe Le Pew is a tour guide in France; Foghorn Leghorn deals cards in a Vegas casino; and the Peter Lorre scientist works a silly torture device on a human victim. (And though he only appears for about a minute, it's worth mentioning to Peter Lorre fans that this is one of the most well-done imitations I've seen of the actor).

The human actors are also surprisingly good.  With this film being the way it is, I wasn't expecting the human actors to put much effort into their performances.  But all of the human leads seemed very into their roles, and played off the Toons wonderfully.  Brendan Fraser throws some priceless expressions at Daffy, and Steve Martain's super villain is as ridiculous and over-the-top as any of the toons.  As with the Looney Tunes, many of the best human performances are seen in cameos.  ""Star Trek: Voyager"" fans will enjoy seeing Robert Picardo ask his master, with dead serious concern, ""What about the duck?""  And Ron Pearlman (of ""Hellboy"") puts everything into the minute-long scene where his stiff Southern corporate character is introduced to the Tasmanian Devil.

The movie's randomness brings in some characters who aren't even related to the Looney Tunes, such as Scooby Doo and ""Dr. Who's"" Daleks.  The reason I'm talking so much about the film's cast, is because that's what makes the movie.  The plot is cute in its silliness, there are some clever jokes, and the animation is very good, but the Looney Tunes and their human co-stars are the real treat here.  ""Back in Action"" is very similar in style to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" as well as a typical Muppet movie. If you're a fan of either of these, and are able to enjoy some low-brow, old-fashioned humor without expecting too much of it, then I highly recommend ""Looney Tunes Back in Action.""",1338508800,,3380,4.7257240204429305

There are so many little things in this movie that after watching multiple times you will still find new things that you didn't see before.

I find that this movie was enjoyable and is watchable for adults and kids. The storyline was decent. The actors were good at knowing where to look and how to react to the cartoon characters, which makes you forget that they aren't real. I liked that they include most of the classic WB characters. It would have been nice if they included some of the newer ones like Babs and Buster Bunny or even the Warner brothers and sister: Yacko, Wacko and Dot.

1978511,4,B0001906VI,"OK guys, this was not meant to be Citizen Kane.  Simply put, this is just a silly, fun movie.  Like any Looney Tunes project, they throw out a ton of gags, and some work and some don't.  The movie is probably best for those of us who grew up watching Bugs and Daffy and company, to enjoy some nostalgic fun.  A lot of the humor will be lost on the kids, particularly as the movie and its actors make fun of themselves and political correctness.  Star Brendan Fraser leads the way, making fun of that actor named Brendan Fraser.  The tunes characters get in on it, with an updated twist.  Mindful of all the complaints about the violence in the cartoons, one of the bad guys refuses to throw dynamite that is about to explode, worrying that he will be sending the wrong message to children.  Porky and Speedy Gonzalez are having lunch, bemoaning what political correctness has done to their careers.  Jenna Elfman (Dharma from Dharma and Greg) has a hard time adjusting to the tunes, at one point lamenting ""who carries dynamite?!?!""  At one point, Bugs does the thing of transforming himself into the heavily made-up woman.  Jenna chides Bugs that it was funny back when, but was distrubing now.  That air of what the characters are not allowed to do or to be in these super-sensitive times is ever-present.  Still, they do manage to create lots of obvious gags and some of the adult humor the toons were known for (e.g., a mad chase through the paitings in the Lourve, where Elmer is transformed into The Scream) and where the characters take on roles and qualities from the impressionists and surrealists.  Joan Cusak makes her inevitable and always excellent appearance.  Some fun, some nostalgia, some making fun of themselves and what society has become.  Not bad for a film based around the looney tunes and the evil of the Acme coroporation (headed by great comic and under-appreciated novelist, Steve Martin).",1218412800,3,1917,4.711711711711712

My expectations were pretty high for this, and ultimately, unfulfilled.

That isn't to say there aren't some great moments here. Bugs, Daffy and Elmer's chase through the Louvre is brilliant, probably the best set piece in ""Back In Action."" The others come less from the plot (as much as there is one) than from the insider type jokes. Having Speedy Gonzales complain that he can't get work in these politically correct times is the most pointed and poignant moment here. The exchange between Matthew Lillard (live) and Shaggy with Scooby (animated) is a snort, too.

In fact, the live stars are second only to Porky Pig in Ham Factor. Brendon Fraser mugs for the camera as DJ Drake, a hapless stuntman whose best gig was doing stunts ""in those Mummy movies."" When it turns out his father, an action movie hero, turns out to be an actual spy, DJ and Daffy have to hit the road to rescue mankind and stop ACME from taking over the world. Both Timothy Dalton (channeling his 007 character to the smarmiest degree) and Steve Martin (doing an absurd Dr Strangelove) are so far over the top that they should have parachutes. Wrestler Bill Goldberg shows up as a baddy. Heather Locklear shows up as a Spy/Vegas Showgirl. (Which leads to another great set piece - the Dancing Yosemite Sams.) Joan Cusak scene steals as ""Mother"" in Area 52; not the Area 51 nonsense. Michael Jordan flashes back from ""Space Jam"" and Peter Graves makes a mission statement.

But the jokes are often in the background (like the board names of ACME VP's for Bad Ideas, Stating the Obvious, Nitpicking, Unfairly Promoted, Rhetorical Questions, Never Learning, Child Labor, Climbing to the Top) and the homages to past silliness. It adds up to plenty of fun moments without much of a movie to hang them on. Lest you think I hated ""Back In Action,"" I really didn't. Joe Dante did a super job of catching the spirit of the old Looney Tunes, but did so without the essence. I enjoyed watching the DVD...but unlike ""Space Jam,"" it didn't make me want to run back and watch the old cartoons again. It will please the kiddies for repeats, but probably not the adults.

This movie is absolutely hilarious.  I'm not a Looney Tunes fanatic but have enjoyed them when I have seen them.  Still, I found myself laughing the entire way through.

While there are some classics right now that were developed like Spongebob Squarepants, and the Rugrats ojn Nickelodeon that are some of the most highly accepted toons out there, you just also can't ever forget the past like Warner Brothers and the Looney Tunes cartoons. They've arguably been some of the most influential and diverse cartoons that have brought us unique and outrageous laughter since the 1930's. Nevertheless, it is quite a shame people now don't appreciate them as much. But, the latest film wasn't at all that bad either.

Looney Tunes: Back In Action brings the uniqueness of real life and animation combined, as another delightful film. In the story, Brendan Frasier plays the son of a spy, which his father has been captured, where Daffy gets the ax from Warner Brothers, to where their cartoons are becoming less funny. In the process Daffy tags along with Brendan, to search for the Blue Monkey, where Bugs and Jenna Elfman follow to try to get Daffy back for re-hiring at Warner Brothers. In the process, the they team up to discover and eliminate the trouble with Acme, and their nutty boss played by Steve Martin. The film was arguably a great delightful experience for me, because I've always been a die hard looney tunes fan for all my life. The movie is restored nicely on DVD, and brings out the excitement it had in the theaters.

All in all, if you're a die hard looney tunes fan, I really do suggest you see Looney Tunes: Back In Action. If you haven't seen any of the classic cartoons that Bugs and company did from years and years ago, then I still suggest you buy or rent this zany delight. That's All Folks.

1978542,1,B0001906VI,"Nobody cares for the looney toons anymore people grew out of it and our young generation of little kids today don't even know much about it.

Joe Dante disgrace the original creator's and master's of the looney toons, they have to be looking down from heaven right now and their spirits are plaining to give him nightmares cause he ruined their characters. These are the ones I'm talking about (Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery, Friz Frelong, Bob McKimson, Chuck Jones, and Mel Blanc). Their defentaly rolling over in their graves right now.

As far as this movie all I know is Bugs and Daffy have team up with live action people Brendan Frasier, and Jenna Elfman to save the world from a evil Acme Corporation the head bad guy is a nerd. The bad guys need a magical diamond to fulfilled their deads.",1124582400,,820,4.609589041095891
1978543,4,B0001906VI,"When animated characters and humans meet, the result can be sublime (""Roger Rabbit"") or ridiculous (""Rocky and Bullwinkle""). ""Looney Tunes: Back In Action"" isn't either, but it isn't bad by any means. Having watched it a few times, I can attest that this is a real homage to the Warner 'toon classics when it works. Basically, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are dropped into a MAD magazine level James Bond parody, involving a kidnapped spy movie star, a Las Vegas show girl, and a mysterious African diamond that can turn people into monkeys. So far, it doesn't sound too promising, but director Joe Dante and writer Larry Doyle really try to make it into a series of classic and updated Looney Tune gags and dialogue. When it works-

as in the wild Vegas casino and Strip chases with Yosemite Sam on both the floor and in a NASCAR racer; the classic Louvre chase with Bugs, Daffy and Elmer Fudd blending in with DaVinci, Monet and Munch; and Wile E. Coyote setting up in the desert for both Bugs and Road Runner- it's terrific. Voice artist Joe Alaskey plays Bugs' Brooklyn accent a little too heavy, but his updated Daffy yakking- about cell phones, product placement, and the like- has a good, snide quality. As for the human cast, Brendan Fraser, here a hapless stunt man whose dad just happens to be a 007-esque spy star both in character and for real (played broadly, if briefly, by ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), is a little bland, and the normally witty Jenna Elfman is mostly eye candy as the studio exec. But those who play cartoon-style characters- Steve Martin as the conniving, manic ""Mr. Chairman"" of ACME Corp., who gets to give orders for everyone from Wile E.

(""Desert Operative"") to Marvin Martian (""Space Operative""), is so unhinged he's a scream- do better in this sort of thing. Joan Cusack is also great as ""Mother"", the white-coated director of ""Area 52"" (not ""Area 51, that paranoid invention created to throw you off""), that mirage-like lab outside Vegas populated by sci-fi monsters.

  My favorite gag here is Bugs singing along with Elvis' record of ""Viva Las Vegas"" while riding in Jenna's car across the desert. Now, that's an inspired update on a classic Looney Tunes setup. The late Jerry Goldsmith, better-known for his melodramatic sci-fi music, showed he could yuk it up as well, particularly with his updated arrangement of ""Powerhouse"", that little pile-driver swing tune you used to hear when assembly lines showed up in the original 'toons.

  If it sounds like I'm a Warner scholar, you're probably right, but you don't have to know the originals by heart to enjoy ""Looney Tunes""- if anything, those who don't know the classic toons will be inspired to check them out. That, I think, is what Dante and Doyle had in mind. Of the extras, the ""Behind The Tunes"" and ""sound-effects"" featurettes are OK but the newly-made cartoon ""Whizzard of OW"" is classic Road Runner right down to the red-clay mesas and ACME...magic tricks? Somebody definitely found their inner Chuck Jones here.

  Oh, yeah- part of the fun here is to spot the supporting Looney Tunes characters as they're dropped into the movie. Foghorn Leghorn as a Vegas poker dealer works, as do the Three Bears as tourists in Paris. But Tweety and Sylvester on an elephant? Never mind. ""Looney Tunes"" may be half live-action and half-animation, but it ain't half bad.",1121731200,5,3354,4.805555555555555
1978544,5,B0001906VI,"Mysteries never cease. This smart and hysterically funny film tanks spectacularly and the disappointing Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a blockbuster and Scooby Doo gets a sequel. Maybe people do get the films they deserve after all!

Joe Dante has always been hit and miss outside of the Gremlins films, but this is way up there with Gremlins 2 as his masterpiece. Unlike recent shorts, this recaptures the feel and insanity of the great Looney Tunes perfectly and Dante fills the live action world they inhabit when not making shorts with more in-gags than you can shake a stick at - and 90% of them are great. Yet critics despised it apart from the brilliant chase in the Louvre: maybe they were too dumb to pick up on the in-jokes? Even Steve Martin isn't as bad as they made out. And the film has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith too.

Terrific entertainment, one of the funniest all-round comedies I've ever seen!",1120262400,3,914,4.635802469135802
1978545,5,B0001906VI,"There are few crimes more reprehensible then the dumbing down of the Looney Tunes in a failed attempt to appeal to today's, presumably dumb, children. Fortunately, director Joe Dante, writer Larry Doyle, lead voice actor Joe Alaskey, and composers John Frizzell and Jerry Goldsmith have created a truly fine work that is able to stay true to the personalities and comedic sensibilities of the original characters.

Actually the credit goes to the entire cast and crew of Looney Tunes: Back in Action. These days, seeing a movie where Steve Martin is actually funny is enough of a gift from the Hollywood Heavens. But, I singled out Dante, Doyle, Alaskey, Frizzel, and Goldsmith for their outstanding efforts. Dante is a brilliant director. The success of this film hinged on his dedication to what made the 'toons classic to begin with: really great timing, and convincing character interaction. Larry Doyle made a name for himself on the Simpsons and this movie is evidence that he was one of the GOOD writers. Simply put, he understands and actually respects the subject matter. I can't say enough about the quality of Alaskey's voice work. He performs the film's two main animated characters, Bugs and Daffy, as well as Tweety, Sylvester, and Marvin the Martian. I don't care what the nitpickers have said, he emulates Blanc almost perfectly. But his skill lies not in mere impersonation, but a genuine understanding of the cadence, timing (again), and personality of the characters. Finally the pace is perfectly frenetic and that's due in large part to the score provided by Frizzel and Goldsmith. They've seamlessly blended the recognizable, classical pieces used in old Looney Tunes shorts with stings referencing Dante's past work, other films, and their own new material. There's not enough room here to mention everything I liked about this movie. Fraser, Elfman, Martin, Cusack, and the rest are great. The script is filled with too many gags to catch in one viewing. Insider film references abound, just like in the old shorts. This is simply the funniest movie I've seen all year.",1118793600,17,2093,5.0491329479768785
1978588,1,B0001906VI,"I was excited when I first saw this Looney Tunes movie, but looking at it now, it's not really that funny. It's just another Roger Rabbit wannabe that fails to receive critical and commercial success as the on film synonymous with live action/animation mixes.

Joe Dante called this an ""Anti-Space Jam"" film. I agree with him. Space Jam was too commercial, but this film's just not funny as the classic counterparts. It had a bland and boring plot and predictble storyline that's not witout its plotholes. Bugs was pretty calm and cool like the Chuck Jones version, so is Daffy,who would occasionally revert to the wacky Bob Clampett Daffy. There were a lot of jokes and famous looney tunes gags in it, but they were all pretty corny in live action. One such joke the CEOs of Warner Bros. studio were the Warner Brothers(obviously not related to Animaniacs). They managed to sneak in a joke about Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzales being politically incorrect. I really didn't like Bugs and Taz expelling gas in their own manner. I think Larry Doyle should go back to writing those poorly written sitcoms of today.

The film really doesn't have the same convincing interaction as ""Roger Rabbit"". The toons were just drawn in one position and later moved around the screen by computer. I prefered when they draw the toons on the photostatic blowups of live action frames and kept being drawn in their corisponding positions no matter where the camera moved. They wouldn't seem flat that way,otherwise the animations okay. The toons are shaded more realistically and they do touch real objects, often they would pick up CG objects, which by the way, the film has UGLY CGI! Come on! It sticks out like a sore thumb for crying out loud! The special effects were all pretty lame. I bet Industrial Light and Magic would do a MUUUUCH better job.

I really don't care for the choice of actors. Enough said. Joe Alaskey was pretty good. He's no Mel Blanc, but he trys.

The only thing I liked in the film was the famous reprisal of a ""Rabbit Fire"" scene. Overall, it's just a pointless waist of money and time. I hope one day, Warner Bros. would go throgh a renaissance and make Looney Tunes funny again. Tiny Toons and Animaniacs successfully recaptured the same classic humor. And I hope the Looney Tunes gang would return in new theatrical shorts, animated by the Warner Bros. Animation and NOT the overseas ones.",1115856000,3,2402,4.725536992840095
1978589,5,B0001906VI,"All too often, the modern incarnations of the classic cartoons miss out on the essential ingredient: Fun! This one does not. It is silly, cliched, and awesome fun for anyone who remembers the heyday of the Warner Bros. cartoons. It also leaves out the nods to political corectness that seem to be de rigeur these days. Daffy gets blasted routinely as in the way he was created for.

Besides staring Daffy and Bugs, most of the other Warner Bros. menagerie make cameo appearances. There are some live action figures like Brendan Fraser, Jenna Elfman, Steve Martin and Heather Locklear who do fine in supporting roles but it is the toons who steal the show.

Warner Brothers had a reputation for never letting anything be too silly for a good gag. They keep that reputation here. They always used to sneak in bits of classical art and music to the extent that common people actually learned to recognize some of the master works: they've become a part of the pop culture through the cartoons. They've kept that tradition alive as well. Who cares? Its funny and that's the point.

The plot is too silly to bother and describe here. The movie also goes a bit over the top towards the end but who cares? It was all fun.

1978590,4,B0001906VI,"Okay, maybe only someone in marketing or sales would really, truly, relate to the idea of changing the entire population of the world into monkeys, have them manufacture shoddy merchandise, and then turn them back into humans to buy the same products under the wondrous and versatile Acme brand.

Guilty as charged, there were several other things I liked about this movie, puerile, dumb and absolutely ridiculous as it was.

One was seeing all those favorite cartoon characters back in action, blending so seamlessly with the real actors and movie sets.  Not only Bugs and Daffy, but Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, Granny and Tweety, Taz, and even Pepe Le Pew, among others.

Two was digging out all the little gems like Scooby Doo's Matthew Lillard hanging out with his alter ego Shaggy, Brendan Fraser being a rejected stunt double for the guy in the Mummy movies,  Bugs Bunny finding Nemo, the Louvre painting-hopping sequence, all the star cameos, and of course the secret agent car and gadgets.

Three was seeing Brendan Fraser, Steve Martin and Joan Cusack fighting it out for the hammiest actor award, with the full support of Jenna Elfman and Timothy Dalton.  You also have to love the Acme management team, with Vice Presidents for Bad Ideas, Stating the Obvious, Nitpicking, Unfairly Promoted, Rhetorical Questions, Never Learning, Child Labor and Climbing to the Top.

Serious it may not be; over the top - definitely; corny - oh yes; but the funny parts were much greater than the whole.  Let's hear it for the Dancing Yosemite Sams.

1978591,3,B0001906VI,"""Looney Tunes-Back in Action"" most likely has the type of humor which one would find funny, but only if that 'one' is a kid, most likely 12 and down. That's just it, this movie's for kids. (Well, I count as a kid, but I guess I'm not the type the movie is aimed for.) Unfortunately, I did not like this movie very much, so this is going to be a negative review.

Alright, first the plot. DJ Drake (Brendan Fraiser) and Kate (Jenna Elfman) join forces with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck to save DJ's dad and a magical blue diamond from the hands of the evil and, if I may add, absolutely annoying Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin), the leader of Acme Company. The blue diamond has the power to turn people into monkeys (yeah. monkeys) and Mr. Chairman wants it to, well, turn people into monkeys. Simple enough, isn't it?

Now, I admit some parts I laughed, like the comment about DJ Drake as the stunt double of Brendan Fraiser. I dunno why, but it was so unexpected I laughed. Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny were occasionally entertaining. I think the animated characters were what saved this movie from being more a painful experience than it was already. My favorite scene was the chase between Elmer, Daffy Duck, and Bugs Bunny through the famous paintings by many famous artists.

There were other rare moments when a laugh escaped me, but most of the time I was staring at the TV screen, wondering whether some people actually thought this was funny (The alien attack at Area 52...). Steve Martin was a pain to watch, with his whole uber-strange character as Mr. Chairman. Poor guy. (Steve Martin, not Mr. Chairman)

I had expected something alot more funnier, alot more wittier, and alot more interesting(er), but, well, I didn't get it. It left me feeling unsatsifed and, to quote a phrase me and my friends use sometimes, like: Dot. Dot. Dot. What's just sad is that this movie could have been better, I mean, there aren't many movies where Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian, and other famous and lovable Looney Tunes characters are with human actors in a movie.

The Grand Conclusion: This movie is stupid. It has the kind of stupid humor which isn't witty, but is funny enough for kids to be entertained. Get it if you want to watch something for the sake of watching something or for the sake of watching something you don't have to use your head at all while watching(Kinda confusing there), but *don't* get it if you're looking for something to really entertain you or something to leave you feeling the satisfaction of watching something good. There are other movies that are much better than this.",1102377600,2,2607,4.609913793103448

1978593,4,B0001906VI,"Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, and almost every other classic WB animated character (including Speedy Gonzalez) make an appearance in LOONY TOONS: BACK IN ACTION.  The movie combines action between the classic animated characters and live actors to tell a somewhat canned story that is as hip as it is corny.

In the movie Daffy Duck is fired by the studio heads after demanding to be paid equally as much as Bugs Bunny.  Brendan Fraser plays DJ Drake, a lowly security guard/stuntman working at WB studios who dreams of becoming more involved in the business, but is fired on the same day after a major accident involving the famed Warner Brothers water tower. Drake's Dad (played by Timothy Dalton) is actually one of the studio's highest paid actors known for his espionage movies.  But Daddy Drake is leading a double life because he's also one of the world's top spies. The evil Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) steals a valuable blue diamond which he needs to turn all the people in the world into monkeys. Once DJ and Daffy find out what's going on, they set out on a world wide adventure to stop Mr. Chairman, get the blue diamond back, and rescue DJ's Dad. They're joined on their journey by Kate (Jenna Elfman), a WB VP, and Bugs Bunny who are sent to bring back Daffy because Bugs Bunny just isn't the same without his old friend and foil.  Along the way the foursome meet up with all kinds of WB animated characters, actors making cameos, and some classic B-picture movie monsters from the WB's past.

LOONEY TOONS: BACK IN ACTION moves at a rate that's faster than most people can keep up with. The witty one-liners, hip references to pop culture, and allusions to WB and movie history are shot out at a pace faster than a pitching machine on hyperdrive. Many of the references kids and younger audiences won't get, but though the film is aimed at children, it's also meant for adults to enjoy. Though the movie isn't on the par of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? and isn't as classy as the classic Warner Brothers cartoon shorts, LOONEY TOONS: BACK IN ACTION makes a valiant effort to equal those standards, but doesn't quite make the mark. Still the movie does enliven the WB franchise characters and provides a foundation to build upon in the future.

The DVD version of the film includes a new Looney Toon short, some deleted scenes with an alternate ending, and a couple of behind the scene featurettes.  I especially liked the ""Behind the Tunes"" featurette with Bugs and Daffy.",1099440000,4,2516,4.676470588235294
1978594,1,B0001906VI,"I just couldn't keep focused on this dud. It's a shame they ruined such a good idea by sticking the likes of Brendan Friasier,the unfunny Steve Martin and other dull human actors in the film. Perhaps if this was 100% animated,it would've done better with audiences.",1095724800,4,265,4.782608695652174
1978595,2,B0001906VI,"I bow to no one in my love and admiration for those classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 1940`s and 1950`s.  Like so many of my generation, I was virtually raised on these works from infancy on up.  Yet, for those of us who are diehard aficionados, ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" is a decidedly depressing experience, proving, once again, that when it comes to revisiting one's childhood, a person truly can't go home again.

This is not, of course, a re-visitation in its purest form, since ""Back in Action,"" like 1996`s ""Space Jam,"" is actually a modernized hybrid combining live action with animation.  And that, perhaps, is the single greatest problem with this film.  Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, the Road Runner and the rest of the gang clearly feel more at home in their own two-dimensional world in which the laws of nature have no jurisdiction.  Yank them out of that context and stick them into the ""real world"" with a bunch of overacting humans and their unique charm begins to drain away and dissipate.  Unfortunately, both the cartoon characters and the humans with whom they are interacting are stuck with a dreary, largely unfunny script that substitutes pandemonium and movement for cleverness and wit (qualities the original cartoons had in abundance).  The spy tale writer Larry Doyle has come up with is stultifying in its stupidity and reminds us of just why the Warner Brother originals, which were masterpieces of minimalist storytelling, ran for ten or fifteen minutes and no longer.  Expanding the story to almost ten times that length stretches the already flimsy material far past the breaking point.

There are a few moments of inspired fun, such as when Bugs and Daffy, followed by an irate Elmer Fudd, jump in and out of art masterpieces in the Louvre, wreaking havoc as they go, or when our intrepid band of heroes encounters a secret Area 51-type government project in the desert inhabited by a coterie of creatures from 1950`s ""B"" movie classics.  In fact, the movie has quite a bit of fun with ""in"" movie references that adults are far more likely to get than the children who clearly make up the bulk of this movie's audience.  But those moments of inspiration are few and far between, and most of the time we are stuck in a fairly dismal comedy overall.  The blending of live action and animation, under the guidance of director Joe Dante, is pretty much state-of-the-art, though these particular cartoon characters have more charm when they are two, rather than three, dimensional in form.

Brendan Fraser, as a stunt man who goes in search of his kidnapped father with Bugs and Daffy along for the ride, makes an appealing hero, although the usually likable Jenna Elfman succeeds mainly in being annoying.  Timothy Dalton has a nothing part as Fraser's dad, a legendary movie actor who turns out to be a spy off screen as well as on.  Heather Locklear, Joan Cusack, Roger Corman, and Kevin McCarthy also make brief appearances, but the single worst job of acting is turned in by an overwrought and over-wound Steve Martin, who as the diabolical head of the Acme Corporation, delivers a ham handed performance of monumental badness.

A few things slightly predictable, but I thought it was excellent.  Seriously, when you're putting every Looney Tune into a live film: (thank God without rubber masks!) ...there's a lot of high exceptions and low exceptions.  I think this movie did just about as well as it could possibly do.  Going from live comedy to Looney Tune insanity and back for both at once.

Fraser and Daffy join forces to find Fraser's dad (Timothy Dalton) a film star who plays a spy who is actually a spy in real life.  He has been kidnapped by a mad scientist (Steve Martin) who wants to find the Blue Daimond, which has magical powers.  Fraser and Daffy have to get to the Blue Diamond before Martin does.  also Bugs Bunny is trying to get Daffy back to the studios.  The mixture of live action and cartoon characters will amuse children, and if you are a big Looney Tunes fan you should love it (I'm more partial to Tom and Jerry myself).

1978624,4,B0001906VI,"""Dynamite?"" yells Jenna Elfman halfway through this film ""Who has dynamite?"". ""Welcome to my world"" comes Daffy Duck's reply. Yes indeed, welcome to the world of the Looney Tunes.
This film has been unfairly compared with Who Framed Roger Rabbit and, although not in that league at all, it has enough comedy and inventiveness to stand as a semi-classic in it's own right. At least it's not Space Jam.
I'm a firm believer that Bugs and co. can quite easily carry their own movie without the help of non-toons, but until then this'll do. For a Looney Tune fan such as myself there are plenty of character cameos and in-jokes to warrent several repeat viewings just to catch them all. The same goes for general movie fans (Roger Corman directs Warner's new Batman movie!?). Most, if not quite all, of the Looney Tune family get screen time with Daffy coming away with the lion's share. Other characters that are well served by the script are Yosemite Sam, Wile E. Coyote and Marvin the Martian leaving the likes of Tweety, Sylvester, Taz and Elmer somewhat under-used - still, it's only a 90 minute movie. We also have a wonderful cameo from a suitably flat-looking Scooby and Shaggy - a joke against classic-versus-TV-animation for the keen-eyed!
A real high-light is the treatment that 'political correctness' gets in the script. We see Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzalez bemoaning P.C. attitudes (stutterers and racial stereotypes being somewhat taboo now) and, at one point, one of Sam's henchmen worrying that if he does indeed throw TNT out of the window ""someone might get hurt"". Sam's guns have been taken from him (although he's still allowed a cannon!) but at least Elmer Fudd has been allowed to keep his trusty rifle. Bugs Bunny's love of cross-dressing also gets questioned!
As with all of the other reviews for this film, I must mention the Louvre scene - Bugs, Daffy and Elmer running through a series of classic paintings. The DVD release allows a little more appreciation of this whole sequence with the use of freeze-frame. Other set-pieces that hit the spot are the Area-52 scenes (with lots of sci-fi fan pleasing cameos from classic aliens) and space-set climax.
The human actors are passable. Frazer and Elfman are not so bland as to be completely up-staged by the toons and Timothy Dalton proves he has a sense of humour by parodying his 007 character. I seem to be one of the few people who enjoyed Steve Martin's performance. Playing it ridiculously OTT, he is as close to a human-toon as possible - I think it works.
Overall, the script is funny enough although the 'plot' is incidental, the animation is excellent and interacts well, if not quite enough, with the real-world and, most importantly, all of the characters stay in character.

1978627,5,B0001906VI,"This movie directed by GREMLINS' Joe Dante falls short of being a classic film, but its mix of live action and animation is impressive, and it's like watching old Saturday morning cartoons.  The plot takes second place to the shenanigans of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and a host of Warner Brothers cartoon superstars.  The scene in which Elmer Fudd chases Bugs and daffy through several world-renowned paintings is brilliant.  Brendan Fraser who usually looks delighted to be an actor seems disinterested in his role, although his handsome countenance is believable; Timothy Dalton tries hard to exude suave spy macho, but comes up short; Jenna Elfman is truly awful in her role as the executive who fires Daffy Duck; Steve Martin is hilarious in his prissy, prancy role as the head villain; Joan Cusack is marvelous in a small role as Mother; and we have cameos from Jeff Gordon, Michael Jordan and Matthew Lillard.  There are some fun ""in jokes"", especially when Fraser talks about being a stuntman for Brendan Fraser on the Mummy movie.  Sometimes movies like this shouldn't be criticized, but just enjoyed for the mindless but fun entertainment they provide.

Couldn't understand all those esoteric and academic discussions that went around regarding this spoof. It isn't worth it, nor is it worthwhile to spend time to see this even for free.
Even the antics of Steve Martin couldn't save this sorry mess, which is a total waste of technology and talent. The producers could have erected a big sign outside the studio lot which might have read something like this: ""On this site will soon rise a new Looney Tunes Moooovie, uninspired in design and plot, with stodgy humor and no style at all."" The story is awful, the dialogue is cheap and the plot holes are incredible. Not one joke in the movie is ever funny. Even for kids, there are a lot of funny movies to choose from out there...this one does not even fall under the genre comedy...I'd place it under the term ""pathetic tragedy.""",1086566400,8,982,4.4916201117318435
1978629,4,B0001906VI,"Cast members of the Looney Tunes gang, which includes the likes of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Tweety, Yosemite Sam, and others have not appeared in a full- length feature film for many years. ""Back in Action"" marks the return of the popular animated characters to the big screen, and it's a movie full of fun and surprises.
Daffy and Bugs are the center of attention in this film, along with an all- star cast of Hollywood personalities that includes Jenna Elfman, Steve Martin, Timothy Dalton, Joan Cusack, Brendan Fraser, and John Cleese. The plot of the movie revolves around the search for a blue diamond. If the bad guy Chairman of ACME (played by Steve Martin) finds it first, he will use its magical properties to turn people into monkeys who will then become slaves to ACME product production and later be transformed back into people to purchase the products. It's up to the good guys (led by Bugs and Daffy) to get the diamond first.
The plot might seem a little hokey, but it works. The reason the movie works is because of the excellent special effects, the interaction of the real people with the cartoon characters, and the comedic dialogue. Much like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", this movie combines the cartoon characters with the regular movie, giving viewers the feeling that the Looney Tunes are right there, in the middle of the action. Some of the interaction sequences are very good, like the scene in Paris when Elmer Fudd is chasing Bugs and Daffy through the Louvre Museum. While all the famous paintings are being admired, there's Bugs, Daffy, and Elmer, running into and out of the pictures on the walls. There are also a few surprises here and there, like a brief appearance by Michael Jordan; the appearance of a Wal- Mart supercenter in the desert, and an appearance by Shaggy and Scooby- Doo.
Some characters don't get much coverage, and this could disappoint viewers. Speedy Gonzales, for example, is shown for only a few seconds, sitting at a table talking with Porky Pig. Pepe LePew is shown for a very short time, too, while the others are running around through Paris. Foghorn Leghorn, Granny, Tweety, and Sylvester get slightly more screen time, with Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and (of course) Bugs and Daffy getting the most exposure of all.
This is a pretty good film overall, with lots of funny comedy, spoofs, and old familiar Looney Tunes phrases and sayings popping up throughout the movie. There's also a good amount of violence, like one would expect in a Looney Tunes film, which is probably why it was given a PG rating.
""Back in Action"" is a very fast- paced film that will charm audiences of all ages. The plot is a little goofy and contrived. But the special effects, the skilled animation, and the good comedy will make you forget all about the story line.",1084147200,3,2812,4.740816326530612

Soon, they're traveling around the world with a studio executive (Jenna Elfman) -- and Bugs is hot on their trail. Steve Martin co-stars as an evil studio head.
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Jenna Elfman, More
Rated PG: For some mild language and innuendo
Realize that this film is for kids up through teenage years. This isn't Oscar material but my six year old howls laughing every time Daffy gets hit or something drops on him or Elmer blasts him. After all the politically correct children's TV we have raised him on, we're pretty sure he can tell the difference between cartoon violence and the evening news kind.
Although not on the artistic level of Who Framed Roger Rabbit or more recently, Finding Nemo or Lion King, it still is a fun movie to watch for the age group intended.

And now last year (or so) Warner Brothers have decided for a little comback for the Looney Tunes. And they even have Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck empoyed at thier studio. And this time they thrown in Brendan Fraser, Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin in the film. As the movie opens, a little cartoon about Bug, Daffy and Elmer Fudd in the works, about rabbit season (or duck season), but Daffy is upset about the treatment that Bugs Bunny (Joe Alasky) get from Warners Brothers. And the vice president of comedy Kate Houghton (Jenna Elfman) points how many laughs Bugs Bunny gets from kids then Daffy Duck in a poll, and Daffy gives the studio a choice of who they get between him and Bugs, and they deicde ""whoever is not the duck"", and fires him right away, and gives him all the stuff from his old office. Enter a security guard named DJ Drake (Brendan Fraser) who Kate picks to eject Daffy Duck from the grounds of Warners Brothers, but he manges to escape and DJ has to chase after Daffy, and catchs trying to steal Batmean's car, but the car rolls and crash into the tower of Warners Brothers and Kate gets DJ fired, with little knowedlge that she fired the son of Damian Drake (Timothy Dalton), and he returns home to find Daffy Duck hitched a ride with him, and tires to get rid of him, and then gets a call from his father, that he is in trouble, and tells him to go to Las Vegas and find Dusty Tails (Heather Locklear) about a diamond called ""The Blue Monkey"", which Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) is after. So DJ and Daffy heads off to Las Vegas, and Kate comes to his door to see if DJ knows where Daffy went, and distrubs Bugs Bunny in the shower, when Bugs calls Daffy, he ttells him that he is not coming back at off with DJ to find the Blue Monkey, and now it is Las Vegas for both Kate and Bugs.",1083715200,,1883,4.277310924369748

I chos love acually because Warner Bros. has not struck gold w/ Looney Tune Movies since Space Jam and boy did that stink!  I went ahead and bought it on DVD because I an a freak.  However when I saw this I was amazed.  It was Halarious:  Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny were classic together.  Steve Martin (Mr. Acme) was totally priceless and unperdictable.  Wiley C.  and the Road Runner even had a good seen.  The Movie was also well thought up, the plot was nuts, and Brenddan F. was perfect!  The movie altogether was PERFECT.

Bugs Bunny and a studio executive(Jenna Elfman) venture out of Hollywood to bring back Daffy. It all turns into a quest for a crystal that can control the world.

The DVD treatment is better than this film deserves. A new short and deleted scenes are the highlights. I recomend ""Who Framed Roger Rabit"" instead of this film.",1081555200,4,774,4.49645390070922
1978677,4,B0001906VI,"This is a movie that suprised me! I wasn't expecting it to be at all great when I first heard of it, and when it came out, it wasn't sending out any vibes at all for some reason? And when I watched it for the first time I was plesently satasfied with the outcome of this film!
Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been a personal fav. of mine since it came out. And tho this movie is in no way near as great as that one. This one should not be missed tho! There have been alot of shocking ""live action"" + ""animated"" or whatever it is you call these type of films like Rocky & Bullwinkle, but this movie is actually pretty darn good!
The plot is pretty much, Daffey Duck gets fired, and so does Brendan Frasers charactor ""D.J"" who is a security guard, trying to be a hollywood stuntman. Seeing as how Daffy cause's D.J to be fired, he kind of follows D.J home. Uninvited of coarse, And D.J's father happens to be a huge hollywood action star, and also a secret agent. Played by Timothy Dalton who is once again a James Bons type of charactor which is good to see a sort of reprised role! His father gets kidnapped and D.J finds himself with Daffy Duck on a wild goose chase to find a bunch of spy stuff to help his father out! And Jenna Elfman plays somebody and she is about to be fired from ""Warner Studios"" because she was the one who fired Daffy. So she has the weekend to get Daffy back for the WB or shes fired. So her and Bugs set out to find Daffy!
Daffy and D.J are on the hunt for an item called the Blue Diamond. And of Coarse the bad guys, ACME, are chasing them because they want that diamond for there own dioboticle schemes which you will have to watch the film to find out what it is! The head bad guy is played by Steve Martin and i have to say, without a doubht, its the crappest role he's ever played! He is one of the few things that brought the movie down! Not that i have anythign against Martin, he is a funny guy; just not with this charactor he plays!
Not every Warner Charactor is in the movie. But it features most of the classic ones! Bugs - Daffy - Marvin the Martion - Wyle Coyote - Yosemite Sam - Fog Horn LegHorn - minimal appearences by Tweety - Granny - Sylvester - Tassie Devil - and if you don't blink at the right time, you will see Speedy Gonzalos - Porky Pig - Ralph - The singing Frog - Road Runner - and even Shaggy and Scooby make a small appearence! and a few others that slip my mind right now. .... guy dressed as Batman and the batmobile if your intrested???
This movie even for me was fun, so its not just for the tiny totts! It features some of the classic warner gags that made us laugh (if you liked the looney tunes stuff that is) this movie is worth at least a rental before beeing dissmissed.
The bonus features could have been a bit better. It shows a behind the scenes of the movie. Daffy and Bugs sitting in a thatre watching the deleted scenes, a few that wernt even finished ect... and some other stuff. I must say the new warner cartoon of ""Road Runner and Coyote"" lacks the comedic genious that the original Warners came up with. So this movie really is suprisingly good. But the bonus features drag it down, and Steve Martins acting is the worst! but ignore that, and its not a bad movie!",1080691200,,3239,4.134706814580031
1978678,4,B0001906VI,"""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" features two kind of actors: from animation world, ever beloved Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Tweety & Silvester, and many, many other familiar characters you might have seen somewhere like on Cartoon Network.  Oh, and humans are first-rate, too: Brendan Fraser, (very lovely) Jenna Elfman, and Steve Martin with his nerdiest performance in this decade.
Like ground-breaking film ""Roger Rubbit,"" the animation characters are living next to us, some of them working for Warner Brothers studio.  Discontented Daffy is, as ever, playing a silly role for the super-star Bugs Bunny, whose ego is as big as some human in Hollywood.  Then, things happen.  Daffy is fired by Jenna Elfman's character (don't ask me why), and hits the road to Las Vegas with Brendan Fraser, whose daddy (Timothy Dalton, self-parodying his 007 image) is kidnapped by megalomaniac company owner Steve Martin.
The plot is non-existent (I tried to summerize it, but it only ends up with a very silly synopsis, as shown above).  In short, it is like ""Spy Kids"" in which crazy things happen around the characters, animation and human alike.
The director is Joe Dante, which means the film is best enjoyed as spoof.  In other words, the film depends more on the cameos and amusing references to other films in the past, than on the original gags themselves.  In the Warner studio, you see they are shooting a Batman movie (with Batmobile, of course), but the film is directed by Roger Corman, king of B movies in the 60s.  Now if you don't get it ... what can I do?
Or see the ""Area 52"" (not 51) section, in which you see countless references to the Sci-Fi films in the past.  There, Robby the Robot is talking!  Here, Derek of ""Doctor Who"" is walking!  That's the way of Joe Dante, whose film ""Matinee"" parodied William Castle, the king of gimmick.
There is more to the film, and it does not forget the younger viewers, but the gags themseves are not something you can call great.  Probably the pre-teens would not understand why Bugs Bunny should cry and lie in a shower room that way in a Hitchcock spoof.
Still, it is delightful to watch the cameos, including Matthew Lillard (who is talking to his counterpart in ""Scooby-Doo""), Ron Perlman, Joan Cuzack, Peter Graves, Michael Jordan, and Heather Locklear.  Plus you see these funny animation characters including that Coyote (this time chasing not Road Runner) and many others.
This is no Chuck Jones nor Tex Avery.  If you want the wacky humor of these masters, see their original animations.  ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" succeeds as spoof of them, and as such gives much fun to the fans.",1080345600,3,2650,4.793406593406593
1978679,4,B0001906VI,"Being a lifelong fan of the Looney Tunes, I was really looking forward to this movie, and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. When Daffy gets fired, he hooks up with a Warner Brothers security guard (Brendan Fraser) who just happens to be the son of a super-spy. Bugs and a studio exec (Jenna Elfman) get caught up in the adventure to save the world from the evil head of the Acme corporation (Steve Martin).
It's not perfect, and a lot of the jokes are pretty corny, but in a GOOD way. There are tons of classic Looney Tunes-style gags, a great chase sequence with Bugs, Daffy and Elmer Fudd running through the paintings in the Louvre, histerical tidbits with Tweety Bird discovering his African roots, Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzales bemoaning their stereotypical status and Scooby Doo and Shaggy berating Matthew Lillard for the awful ""Scooby Doo"" movie. Sure, there are a lot of winking at the audience jokes and Steve Martin chewed up so much scenery his dental premiums must have skyrocketed, but it was all in good fun.
This DVD also includes some pretty nice behind-the scenes featurettes, a commentary, and a brand-new Coyote and Road Runner short, ""The Whizzard of Ow,"" which cracked me up. It's a great short in the style of a Chuck Jones masterpiece -- Chuck himself would have been proud of it.

I don't know if you ever watched Dr. Who, but there was even a scene that had the Daleks in it screeching EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE as they were shooting laser beams everywhere. Basically, bradon frasier plays a guy who's dad is basically the most famous actor of all time who plays a james bond type of guy. Which is funny cause they make fun of james bond movies by having movie posters of him saying titles like ""the spy is me"" and stupid things like that, his dad is actually played by timothy dalton, so that helped too. Anyways, he's trying to be a stuntman but can't get a job. His dad gets captured by a evil guy (head of ACME corporation) and so brandon is off to save his dad. Daffy Duck tags along because he has just been fired from warner brothers and has nothing better to do. Bugs Bunny shows up trying to convince daffy to come back to work. The evil guy is played by steve martin and he was absoluetely HORRIBLE! I mean, he was the worst acting I've seen in a long time. They should have gotten Mike Myers, or Robin Williams cast for that particular part. Steve Martin is funny, but not in this role. Anyways, in the end they rescue the dad, save the world, and blah blah blah. But it's pretty funny. Joan Cusak does an appearance as a wierd willy wonka type of scientist in a secret base in the desert called Area 52 (They explain area 51 was made up as a cover story to cover up the existance of Area 52. At area 52 is a sign that says something like ""Area 52, keeping things secret from the world for 47 years"" or something like that. A lot of subtle humor, I'm not sure kids would get most of it, adults will though. Kids will laugh I guess at just the cartoons on the screen, even though they don't have a clue what's going on. There's scenes in Hollywood, Las Vegas, France, and Africa. The one thing I didn't like is, since the original guy died, Mel Blanc, who did most of the voices, they haven't been able to get somebody who could do a decent Bugs Bunny voice, actually quite a few of the voices weren't that good, which is just stupid cause I knew people in high school who could do some of those characters just as good as the original guy, you're telling me that warner brothers can't find somebody who can do a dead-on bugs bunny voice, BS.",1079308800,,2404,4.239651416122005

1978703,4,B0001906VI,"I find it really sad how cel artwork used in animated cartoons is becoming a dying art form in recent years. While computer animation is really amazing as ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"" demonstrates, I feel that they should never stop making straight-out cel animated movies. To me, cel art requiring hand painting and drawing is really creative and amazing.
 If you liked ""Space Jam"" from several years back, then you are likely to enjoy ""Looney Tunes: Back In Action"" and I would say that they really do return to action on this good, fun but somewhat disjointed flick. In a lot of ways, this film brings back memories of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" from my childhood and this is a really good thing for me. If you're looking for anything thought-provoking or requiring intellectual challenge, then you will want to pop in something else for now but for everyone else who wants a good time and can withstand thin acting in parts then by all means go and give this movie a watch. There is plenty of entertainment to offer and will make you laugh.
 It all begins where Daffy Duck is jettisoned from his workplace because of competition from his cartoon rival, the witty and funny Bugs Bunny, but Daffy Duck runs into a recently fired stuntman named Bobby Delmont. Delmont is eager to find and rescue his father who was recently kidnapped by renegade ACME criminals and several of the antagonistic Looney Tunes characters like Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and two really big cartoon criminals help in trying to retrieve a powerful artifact called the Blue Diamond and use it's power through an orbiting satellite and transform all of the Earth's human population into monkey's in order for them to buy his products and turn them back into humans in order to make a gigantic fortune out of it.
 Not all of the Looney Tunes characters show up in the movie but enough of them do to make the movie acceptable. My favorite of the Looney Tunes are Bugs Bunny and Tasmania. I really love how the former rivals Daffy and Bugs clash in the early part of this movie but then eventually work together to prevent the Diamond from being used for ACME Corporation's malevolent schemes. Tasmania's twisted and demented character is just incredibly hilarious even if he is only in a few scenes through this film.
 The acting by the cast playing the non-cartoon characters is a bit hammy in my opinion. Brendan Frasier does alright as the insecure Bobby Delmont whose trying to find his father and save him from ACME Corporation. While not necessarily bad or awful by any means, Jenna Elfman looked rather uncomfortable on this role and her character Kate came off as being dry and totally uninteresting at best nad it almost looked like she was just ready to leave the set altogether.  To me, the Looney Tunes characters were who really carried this film. The acting is good during several clumsy disaster scenes and there is even a cameo appearance from Batman during a botched filmmaking scene but there's more there than I want to give out.
 While not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, ""Looney Tunes: Back In Action"" succeeds in being a highly entertaining and fun flick even if the acting by Fraser and Elfman comes off being skiddish and even clumsy at times. Give this movie a try. While I'm not saying that this movie is really a must-have, it offers enough to warrant keeping it and younger audiences should see it just for the sake of keeping Looney Tunes alive for all the years to come and older audiences to continue to enjoy their childhood favorites. Even if this movie is forgotten in the future, The Looney Tunes and all of our beloved classic cartoons that we have enjoyed over the last 75 years since 1928's Mickey Mouse are immortal and will never die off from our memories.",1078963200,2,3790,4.683183183183183

If, however, you're looking for some old fashioned, anvil dropping, coyote flattening fun, then you will enjoy this film.  The human cast alone is worth the price of admission, as Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman goof their way through the admittedly thin plot, while Steve Martin, Timothy Daulton, and Heather Locklear (among many other WB favorites) make notable appearances along with the animated likes of Marvin the Martian, Wil E. Coyote, Roadrunner, Michigan J. Frog, Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, Taz, and many others.
The best part of the movie is that you really don't care that the plot is incredibly thin.  I couldn't even tell you what the plot was--I just had a fun time watching the film.  That this film works so well is a testament to what Chuck Jones and Mel Blanc created so many years ago.
Although I was a bit disappointed with the deleted scenes (the Bugs & Daffy animation that serves as lead-ins to the deleted scenes looks like it was done by a high school student on a home PC), the overall package gets a resounding thumbs up.

There were times when he stole the scene more than Bugs and Daffy, esp. in some scenes when he was trying to keep Daffy from going crazy over riches such as gold.

As a 007 fan, I appreciated the humor of casting a former James Bond, Timothy Dalton, as Brendan Frasers, spy dad.  How about a VP of Comedy played by Elfman who never smiles?  The animation technique of inserting the cartoon characters into the scenes has really advanced since Petes Dragon and even the Roger Rabbit movie.
The movie constantly alludes to scenes from WB cartoon classic moments such as.. Didn't you love it when they are crashing towards the ground, but stop 5 feet short of the ground because they ran out of gas!  Ah Oh Eh!  How about when bugs says they must have made a wrong turn at Albuquerque?
This is not a 5 star movie.  It is maybe a 2 or 3 star movie, but I'll round up for the Laugh of Load moments and because I like Fraser.  On the child-o-meter, all my children sat and watched the whole movie, and I often saw them smiling and giggling as they watched.  I recall no nudity or foul language; I am rounding up again to a 4 star rating.  Keep making movies that make us smile and laugh!  Please!",1078617600,,1482,4.287769784172662
1978709,3,B0001906VI,"Although Looney Tunes Back in Action is no where near as good as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. it's still better than other movies to mix live action with animation since Roger Rabbit. Bugs and Daffy steal the show and make the movie watchable.  Brendan Fraser, Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin try hard but none of them are as interesting as the cartoon characters. Although I think Joan Cusack shines in a small role as a scientist in Area..... 52.  The movie deserved more money at the box-office  because it does have it's funny parts. The script is just weak and not as original as Who Framed Roger Rabbits'. Fans of Looney Tunes should find  it some-what enjoyable though.",1078358400,,670,4.6525423728813555
1978710,3,B0001906VI,"In the world of ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"", cartoon characters and humans co-exist and interact. As the story goes, Warner Brothers studios has grown tired of Daffy Duck's demands, and since the studio has a low estimate of his market value anyway, they have fired the Duck. But Bugs Bunny just can't work without Daffy to pick on, so Warner Brothers has insisted that the vice president of their comedy department, Kate Houghton (Jenna Elfman), get the Duck back pronto. In the meanwhile, a dejected Daffy (voice of Joe Alaskey) has taken up with D.J. Drake (Brendan Fraser), the security guard who escorted him off the studio lot. D.J. has been shocked to learn that his movie star father is actually a secret agent, and both he and Daffy have gone to Las Vegas to rescue the elder Drake and recapture the ""Blue Monkey"", a diamond that has supernatural powers. When they learn of D.J. and Daffy's whereabouts, Kate and Bugs Bunny (voice of Joe Alaskey) set out after them. They all end up trying to foil the plans of the evil Chairman (Steve Martin) of the Acme Corporation who wants to use the Blue Monkey to achieve global domination.

So the plot is hokey. It's a spoof of James Bond films, featuring former Bond himself, Timothy Dalton, as secret agent Damian Drake and Steve Martin as the head of a very Spectre-like Acme Corporation, alongside a host of Warner Brothers cartoon characters. ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" may appeal to young children, but there's nothing to  entertain adults who enjoy the looney gang from Warner Bros. It has some clever moments, and the writing for Daffy Duck is good, but between the bright spots it's a real snooze. There are cameos by a host of television and film stars, including Heather Locklear and Joan Cusack. The story is far too silly, even for a cartoon, to keep the attention of any but the youngest viewers. The film exploits the humor of its Warner Brother characters but  needs a much better story to tie them together. Looney Tunes have traditionally been sophisticated enough to entertain fans of all ages, so I see no reason why this movie shouldn't be. I'm giving it three stars for some occasionally clever writing, but as a whole ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" isn't very watchable. It may entertain children under 6 if they have the patience for it.

The DVD: Bonus features include ""Behind the Tunes"", a comical making-of documentary narrated by Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, ""Bang, Crash, Boom"", a special effects documentary also narrated by the cartoon duo, ""Whizzard of Ow"", a short animated film featuring Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner in which the Coyote makes use of a book of wizardry in pursuing the bird, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, and a DVD-ROM which contains additional scenes. ""Behind the Tunes"" is only mildly informative, but it's fun. ""Whizzard of Ow"" is a must for Road Runner fans; it's the same format as all Road Runner cartoons. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.",1078272000,6,3030,4.7988505747126435
1978711,4,B0001906VI,"The storyline to the movie is ridiculous and silly which is why I can only give it 4 stars. It consists of Brendan Frasier playing a security guard for WB studios. When he is fired by a WB executive played by Jenna Elfman, Frasier discovers that his famous movie star father (Timothy Dalton), is really a spy. His father has now gone MIA while working on his latest mission. Frasier takes on the mission and the responsibility of rescuing his father. Meanwhile the higher ups at WB are upset with Jenna Elfman's character for also firing Daffy Duck. They give her three days to find Daffy and bring him back. Daffy of course teams up with Frasier in an attempt to save the world from the evil ACME company run by Steve Martin. Jenna and Bugs Bunny set out to find Daffy, and end up joining Frasier and Daffy in their mission.
Before I watched this film, I was extremely hesitant. I have never been a big fan of Brendan Frasier, and the film looked incredibly stupid. However, I have been a fan of the Looney Tunes since I was a little kid, and the curiousity of how they appeared on screen today got the better of me. ""Looney Toons Back in Action"" turned out to be an extremely enjoyable film. Like I have previously stated, the story to this film was ridiculous. However, the film did have strong points. First of all, the animation was superbly done. All of the Looney Toons characters make an appearance in this film, and really look like they are interacting with the actors involved. Brendan Frasier and Jenna Elfman did an extremely good job in their roles, because they helped to make the animation seem more realistic. Steve Martin and Joan Cusack also did a very good job in their roles as well. Even professional wrestler Bill Goldberg did a decent job as the silent and menacing right hand man of Steve Martin. One of the best gags of the film featured an appearance of the animated Shaggy and Scooby Do going off on Matthew Lillard for how he portrayed Shaggy in the Scooby Doo movie.
This film is obviously not going to win any awards. However, if you take it for what its worth, you will end up having a great time watching it. Overall, the laughs were non-stop, the actors did a good job, and the animation was right up there with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The DVD extras are AWESOME by the way. Bugs and Daffy host the featurettes and interact with the cast and crew. It was quite funny to see Daffy hitting on Jenna Elfman. If you are a Looney Toons fan, you will definately enjoy this movie.
A solid 4 stars...",1078012800,,2529,4.452586206896552
1978712,2,B0001906VI,"Having seen Spacejam, I was all up for seeing this film.  It is boring, poorly acted and the plot is idiotic.  It is everything that Spacejam wasn't.  Go rent Spacejam instead and save your money on this.  Brenden Fraser seems to always make a turkey when he gets involved in cartoons (Dudley Do-Right was another bomb).
If you want to see Brendan in a funny movie, I suggest Bedazzled.",1077840000,,386,4.550724637681159

Joe Alaskey voices the most accurate versions of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck since Mel Blanc, in my opinion. Jenna Elfman and Brendan Fraser are just icing on the cake; they do not overshadow the Looney Tunes, which is a good thing. A funny, well-made movie.",1516060800,,427,4.863013698630137
