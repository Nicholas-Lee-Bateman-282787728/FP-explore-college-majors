8701065,5,B00T9YLYP8,"In the July 2015 issue of Opera News William R. Braun states that ""though Strauss's Vier Letzte Lieder have been done to death, on occasion things can nonetheless go beautifully right"". This concert from last year was presented to commemorate the one hundred-fiftieth anniversary of Strauss's birth. The Dresden Staatskapelle has been one of the most respected interpreters of Strauss during and since the days of the composer and here using the stage of the Semperoper maintains that status. Soloist Anja Harteros ""has something a bit severe in her demeanor and voice that is not the least bit unattractive, and the distancing effect is clearly an interpretive choice"". Wolfgang Rihm has orchestrated what was in all probability Strauss's actual last song, ""Malven"". Here it is placed between ""Fruhling"" and ""September"" in the Four Last Songs. Further Rihm has done some harmonic ""tweaking"" in addition to his orchestration. Rihm's own Ernster Gesang (Serious Song) is presented also. The featured work, Eine Alpensinfonie, (The Alpine Symphony) ""is a triumph, with...a wind section that can play as a single instrument when necessary..."" and Staatskapelle conductor Christian Thielemann shapes ""...the midpoint achievement of the summit without distending it..."" To watch ""him is curious, since he (like Harteros) hardly seems to be doing anything"". However such is refreshing as opposed to a conductor who always draws focus. His ""considerable success was achieved in rehearsal"". The Dresden audience ""mercifully leaves some awestruck silence after each piece,"" (seventeen sections) ""and the home listener will agree that something special has taken place"".",1434931200,,1660,5.539370078740157
