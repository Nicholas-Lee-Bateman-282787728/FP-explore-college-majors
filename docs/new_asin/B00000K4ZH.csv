1243129,4,B00000K4ZH,"One of the key factors that went into the development of Animaniacs was the vaudeville-type nature of the show: a large cast of characters with some headliners, and a little bit of something for everyone of all ages.  Wakko's Wish continues this tradition with a plot that combines all the  major Animaniacs characters, adds a large number of well-done musical  numbers, humor for all ages, and overall is an excellent addition (and  hopefully not a conclusion) to the Animaniacs series.
If you have never  seen Animaniacs, this movie may not be the best place to start: there's a  lot of in-jokes (such as Dot's story, Pinky and Pharfignewton's  relationship, and the oddities in the Cave), and the large number of  musical bits may remind you of typical theatric animated films.  However,  those that are familiar with the show will recognize that music plays a  significant role in both the series and in the movie.  The music itself is  outstanding as composed by Randy Rogel, including several original works as  well as a lyrical adaptation of Liszt's 'Hungarian Rhapsody #2' that does  an excellent job of progressing the plot instead of being an aside to  it.
The plot itself is very good; simple and easy to understand for the  youngsters, but leaves enough meat for the creative humor that attracts  adults to this show.  The pacing is a bit off at points; the first and last  10 minutes may seem slow as the characters and setting is established, then  concluded, but once the movie hits the middle block, it moves quite well,  and you'll wonder where the time went.  Given that there are 9 teams aiming  towards the Wishing Star (in a ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad  World""-type fashion), they are connected very well, with airtime  shared being all of them fairly (Needless to say, the Warners get most of  it, but it's their show to begin with).  Even more impressive is that the  characterization remains unchanged: Brain still wants to take over the  world, Slappy is still grumpy, Mindy is still overly curious.  This is also  quite surprising given the number of characters actively involved with the  plot.
Voicework is well done: Rob, Jess, and Tress do an excellent job on  their voices for the Warner Sibs throughout, and the supporting cast supply  their voices well.  All the characters aid in the lyrics, which may be odd  for some of the voice actors; for example, Nathan Ruegger, who voices  Skippy, is in his own 'wonder years', and his singing may be off at points  (but is nicely commented on within the movie).
Animation is top-notch as  done by TMS, who has done the best animation for Animaniacs in the past.  A  good use of shadows on both characters and background help to immerse the  viewer into the story.  There's a few CGI parts, some painfully obvious,  some not, but these are limited and do not detract from the overall  enjoyment of the show.
Those with younger viewers will be glad to know  there are no real sensitive parts in this movie.  Besides Pinky getting  bopped on the head with a pencil, there's no real violence.  There is on  Bambi-esque like moment near the end, but it passes quickly, and you  shouldn't have to worry about consoling your youngster after it's over.
Overall, Wakko's Wish is a joy for any fan of the Animaniacs show, and  continues the tradition of bringing humor and entertainment that can be  enjoyed at multiple levels.  Some of the humor and plot requires a passing  knowledge of the TV show, but for those that have it, this movie is a great  trip, and is an excellent addition to the series.",945561600,9,3569,4.702922077922078

(BTW, It was on VHS at least 10 years ago with showings on Cartoon Network and Kids WB in between.)

In this epic feature film, our cast of characters live in the village of Acme Falls where it's ruled by an evil king taking all their money by his most trusted adviser Baron Von Plotz (Thaddeus).  Because of this, Wakko has no money to help his extremely unwell sister Dot.  So Wakko makes a wish on a star and said star falls to Earth making it available to anyone who touches it will have their wish granted.  Thanks to a zany song sequence (one of many original tunes found in this movie), it's a race to the star as characters like Pinky and the Brain, Slappy and Skippy Squirrel, Mindy and Buttons, Dr. Scratchansniff and Hello Nurse, and a few dozen others try to get to the star for their first crack at a wish.  But that evil king wants to be the first himself, and that won't be good when he gets his wish.

With all the heartwarming hilarity the original series once offered, you can bet that ""Wakko's Wish"" is a true definite animated classic for all to enjoy.  And that goes to anyone that watches the series since the beginning.",1419552000,3,1323,4.349593495934959

Tapes get bad after a while and later you can't watch anything anymore. You can hardly still find video machines and tapes. We had one video machine and soon after I received the tape I set it over on a clean dvd. Anyway, it's a wonderful story and still available for all the greatest fans of Animaniacs.

1243223,4,B00000K4ZH,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

  By the way, I caught ""Wakko's Wish"", a feature-length ""Animaniacs"" animated movie on the Hub channel, with commerical interruptions.  Does that count as watching it?  Whatever, I'm reviewing it anyway.

  As other posters have mentioned, ""Wakko's Wish"" is a vaguely Christmas-like, vaguely medieval tale of the town of Acme Falls, once prosperous but now made destitute by the avaricious, tax-collecting Baron von Plotz (Warner Studio manager Plotz) and his dull-witted, rotund constable/officer/sheriff Ralph (ordinarily the Warner Studio guard).  Of all the town denizens (consisting of practically all the Animaniac cast from Pinky and the Brain to the unwanted Mime), the Warners are hit hardest.  Not only are they orphans, but Warner sister Dot has an unspecified illness.  Only Warner brother Wakko keeps his spirits up and vows to go to the city and back to make things better.  Wakko leaves and returns with...a half penny.  Not much, you think?  But the town is overjoyed because even that currency can go a long way to make everyone prosperous and happy.  Yes, until the insatiable Baron Plotz grabs the half-penny, too.  Oh, dear.

  Yet, fear not, Wakko one night manages to select the wishing star of all the multitude of stars in the sky. The ""Star Fairy"" (I guess that's his name) congratulates him and says the wishing star will now plummet to earth.  Whoever reaches the fallen star and touches it first will have his (or her) single wish granted.  Dot inadvertently blabs to the whole town about it, and everyone (Pinky, Rita, Slappy Squirrel, Dr. Scratchnsniff, Hello Nurse, the Goodfeathers, et. al) races to be the first, a la ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"".  Added to this frothy concoction is the overall ruler, the tyrannical King Salazar, who not only selfishly seeks the wish, but also heartlessly wishes to eliminate the Warners, who harbor an unsettling secret.

  There are your basic plot and premise.  If you're a rabid Animaniacs fan, you will probably appreciate ""Wakko's Wish""'s tuneful energy, witty banter, Hollywood satire and arcane jokes, manic slapstick, and vivid, obsessed characters -- the usual stuff you expect from ""Animaniacs"".  If you are walking into ""Wakko's Wish"" cold, you probably still enjoy the feature's fast pace, lively animation, and cartoon antics.  What may be unexpected is the positive moral of unselfish caring for others that emerges from underneath the zany goings-on.  Except towards the end, when Yakko (for the second time) cradles sick Dot's head and promises to tell her a story, that solicitude doesn't get overly sappy and treacly.  The Warners are really the only characters in the movie who have altruistic plans for their wish - Wakko most of all.  But will Wakko be the first to touch the star?  And what will he wish for?  Watch and see.  You will not be disappointed.  You may even be amply satisfied.

P.S.:  You will also learn a bit about the Warners' pedigree.",1354492800,,2990,5.040899795501023
1243224,5,B00000K4ZH,"This movie is about the warners race to the wishing star with all the cartoon cast like Yakko Wakko & Dot Pinky & the  Brain Slappy Squirrel Skippy Squirrel Rita Runt Mindy Buttons Ralph C.E.O of warner Bors. the king the goodfeathers Chicken boo and Hello nures & mrnva Mink plus a bouns toy inside the VHS tape pleas wacth the end credits with all the cast crew this is a full leght movie and few songs like wakk's ha penny, the wishing star, and some side story like Pinky & the Bran Mindy Buttons Slappy Squirrel & skippy Squirrel & the KIng and Ralph & plotz & Yakko Wakko & Dot & also dot Got kill By the king and all the animaniacs cast got there wish the fist wish was Yakko Wakko & Dot then Sappy Squirrel Skippy Squirrel Rita & Runt then Plotz & MIndy & Button the mime didten get his wish so he he with the safe and Pinky and the Brain's wish was the world and the mime use a fake ha penny all the army was fighting and Rita was singing about Wakk'os ha penny And Yakko tell Dot a goonight sotry and Wakko was singing About tiwnkel tiwnkwl wishing star then everything turn green then pip came along tell him about the wishing star and Rita & Runt saw it too Rita said,"" What was That and Runt said,"" I don't konw Rita  pip said,' Go Get Your Wish Wakko where do you mean go, pib said,"" To where the star landed"".",1352073600,,1324,4.088461538461538
1243225,5,B00000K4ZH,"When I was 12, I saw this movie first before I saw Animaniacs. It was during a time when Animaniacs were off primetime, but Cartoon Network was showing good kids movies. Wakko's Wish was a popular request. But despite the fact that I recorded it, I still insisted getting home early to watch it live on Cartoon Network. Now, it's not Animaniacs fun from the show, it's more of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory meets any sad Disney film, but maybe that's why I loved it so much. It had humor, it had charm, it had light moments, it had dark moments, it had the youngest sister become a sob story, but she still held her own when it came to dishing out the comedy and getting them out of situations. It had an awesome score, because it was set to classical music, and I now have to sing out loud whenever I hear those familiar tunes.

And it had a moral to the story, that they spell out in plain letters at the end of the movie, just in the case the little ones missed it. Something you can't say for all children's film. It didn't treat kids as dumb, but it did play to its audience members, commenting on a few jokes that I didn't get until I was in high school. This is literally, in my opinion, one of the greatest kids films never released in theaters. But I have Aspergers, so maybe my opinion is more biased then it seems.",1351209600,,1333,4.227450980392157
1243226,5,B00000K4ZH,"This movie is why I'm an Animaniacs fan. Actually, I wasn't a fan for a long time, but it came to me when I decided to rewatch this movie (I've seen it when I was really young...On Cartoon Network), which led to me watching the show itself. Heck, I even bought the licensed video game! But my fandom aside, Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish is a timeless animated classic.

It's nice to see most of the characters play all-new roles in this movie, yet still keep their original personalities (EX: Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff dries to make a successful drink, and the Warners are orphans). However, since the movie takes place in a town whose wealth was squeezed up dry by Plotz, there's a more serious plot, and it's taken even further with a villainous king who wants the Warners to die off. Does that mean the series's off-the-wall humor is destroyed?

Actually, no! The Warner Bros (And of course the Warner Sister) still make more incredibly witty jokes (And perhaps some old ones snuck in, too?), and the fact that Pinky and the Brain make their appearances in this movie creates an even better mood for the average Animaniacs fan. Those two brought their own humor to the movie, as well (NARF!).

The music that the characters sing add to the feel of the movie, and they are filled with wonderful and catchy tunes. Even if one song were to last a little longer than expected, you can't help but be appealed to the lighthearted tone of the songs.

There aren't a lot of cartoon shows out there today that are even worth watching for the very least, but Animaniacs left a powerful impression upon me. The movie is no different from the show when it comes to bringing such greatness. When combining all that I've talked about together, it creates a feel for me that is unmatched by anything else. This is perhaps the best direct-to-video movie you could ever buy. It's totally worth watching.",1325462400,,1879,4.6
1243227,4,B00000K4ZH,This movie is not what I expected.  The content is a little advanced for 4-5 year olds.  But the characters are really cute.,1200355200,,124,4.3478260869565215
1243228,4,B00000K4ZH,"This feature-length film is a must see for anyone who appreciates the clever and hilarious wit that made Steven Spielberg's ""Animaniacs"" shine on the small screen.  Unlike numerous movies based on television series, this one actually does justice to the show on which is was based.

While the plot obviously still revolves around the Warner siblings, this film does not recycle the premise of the TV show.  In this quirky story, Yakko, Wakko and Dot live in a medieval town called Acme Falls where the greedy Baron von Plotz is taxing the villagers to the max.  In order to improve things in Acme Falls, Wakko formulates a plan which involves making a wish on a wishing star that has fallen to Earth.

During this entertaining romp, viewers will enjoy ten original songs and the original voice talents from the TV series.  Many of the supporting characters from the series show up playing the residents of Acme falls.  As ""Animaniacs"" no longer airs in syndication, seeing this film is a great way revisit the brilliance of this incredible show.",1111276800,3,1045,4.837078651685394
1243249,5,B00000K4ZH,"My god i know i was being generous with the five stars, but come on! This movie has it, it's got comdey, it's got romance (Between Pinky and a horse), it's got a sad part in it that made me cried, THE TENTH TIME I SAW IT! I mean everytime i watch that scene with Dot and Yakko that she is about to die, it just makes me have a tear drop. I mean this movie is like a god, some times you get sick of the songs, but they are catchy, there's one about money, catching the wishing star, if you make a wish what would it be, loosing money, and a song about never giving up hope, which is also a good message those parents out there...so if your kid wants that movie, don't think twice buy it, in fact you can watch late at night, when the kids are asleep, and hear and see all the comdemy for those of you who can get the older jokes. It's more of a kids movie when just watching the plot, but the comdemy is for adults, the romance is for the women (Or men), and that one scene at the end where it made me cry can be for 10-14 year old girls who just need to be all moody and cry about Dot. Also in the story you can hear the story of 'mom and dad', Yakko, Wakko, and Dot's parents who died a long time ago, when Dot was not even a year old (I think). Dot is really the one who wants to hear the story, but Yakko doesn't mind, and Wakko stands and watches them, because Dot is sick, and he wants to help her but lost money to.

This story also gave me a chance to see more of Dot's brothers helping her out in her time of need. Wakko really is the one who has the spot light in the movie, Dot along side with him because they want the money in the first place to save her, from the sickness she has which no one knows what is it, until the end, you probably won't get it then. One thing i will say is this, everyone know's they're orphans and they all know that they went to the star to get money to help Dot, but being their greedy selfs, they wanted the star to them, to them make a wish. It doesn't seem until Dot has fallen and she can't get up that everyone sees how greedy they were, and be's all '(Gasp)', even Brain, from Pinky and the Brain, and Mindy, who is just a baby. Everyone who is from serious to whackness goes in shock at that point, and it doesn't say the movie, they then see how greedy they were, if they hadn't run off to get the star for themselfs, maybe the king wouldn't find out, and maybe they could have gotten it and Dot would survive. (She does i'm just saying from this point)

But anyway, say I'm this generous person all you want, but when i hate something i'll let you know. But this i love, sometimes I just start to think of the movie, and even if i am in the tub i would get out and set it up in my VCR, i recorded Wakko's Wish when Cartoon Network was airing it. Although my picture is not perfect, so i think i need a new one. But trust me, some of you know me from 'Fanfiction.net' then you know Gothica13 never lies. So trust me one this one, for those of you whose favorite chariter is Wakko, he is the main star, and Dot right next to him, and Yakko shows how nice of a brother and a leader he can be.

Now i just wish that they would make a sequel. Then that would be cool.",1094601600,2,3213,3.9097859327217126

I loved the music (wouldn't be a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes without Franz Liszts' ""Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2"")
It's a great movie, filled with humour both parents and kids can appreciate. I watched it last night with my friends and the humour we laughed at on the series was even funnier in our college days!

1243252,4,B00000K4ZH,"If you haven't seen the ""Animaniacs"" TV series, ""Wakko's Wish"" might be a little hard to follow at times. The number of in-jokes are staggering, and a lot of the characters don't get enough screen time to properly introduce them. Still, the movie does give even the ""Animaniacs virgin"" a fair deal of exposure to the cast and relationships.
The Warner Siblings are the stars of the show, of course, and although they never get quite as zany as they were in the TV series, they have several brilliant moments. Pinky and the Brain are also in great shape here, and a lot of the funniest moments in the movie are thanks to them. The rest of the cast make varied preformances -- The Goodfeathers do better in this movie than they ever did in the TV series, as do Mindy and Buttons, but Slappy isn't really up to par (mostly since she doesn't get to blow anything up), and Rita and Runt aren't used to their full potential here either.
For the people who HAVE seen the series, it's impossible not to compare the movie rather unfavorably to it. The TV series is funnier, has better music, is more intelligent and has more of that genuine charm that comes from really good animation. This isn't to say the movie is bad, but it does lack that little extra spark to raise it from merely ""good"" to ""outstanding.""
All gripes aside, ""Wakko's Wish"" is the first direct-to-video animated film I've seen that actually makes good use of the format. It's one of those rare movies that is more enjoyable the second time you watch it, because by then you know what's really going on, and a lot of the scenes that seemed overly-saccharine during the first viewing suddenly become delightfully ironic. This is a storytelling trick that is ideally suited to the direct-to-video format, since those types of movies ARE the ones most likely to be seen repeated times. I hope more producers will learn from this.
""Wakko's Wish"" definitely deserves four stars out of five. It's quite good, while not up to par with Warner's very best.",1004054400,10,2008,4.611731843575419
1243253,5,B00000K4ZH,This film was really great! I heard about it on the Internet but it's not available in the UK where I live so I had to beg my brother to try and get it when he went over to the USA. I had to wait a long time for it - and I wasn't disappointed. I'm nearly eighteen but I love Animaniacs and I thought Wakko's Wish was wicked! The songs were great and I couldn't stop laughing at the jokes. I definitely recommend this to any Animaniacs fan! I'd give it six stars if I could!,978998400,,473,3.88659793814433
1243254,5,B00000K4ZH,"ok, I didn't really like the theme and all the songs and stuff, but the charecters are really cute. Im a lil too old for the corney music and to actually think its that funny, but Its still not that bad. The animaniacs go on a race to the wishing star in this movie.",972691200,,266,3.9444444444444446
1243255,2,B00000K4ZH,"I'm a huge Animaniacs fan, and I'm surprised that so many people are giving this full-length movie positive reviews. It's ok, but it's not  nearly as sharp as the cartoon. Granted, I'm an adult, and it is definitely  a kids movie, but that was always the case with the 'toon, as well. The  jokes just aren't as funny, and the songs are nothing like the 3 CDs full  of Animaniacs songs I own. They're boring and repetitive. I bought this  video, watched it once, and gave it to a friend with kids. The VCR ate the  tape as soon as they got it, and I didn't even feel bad.",966988800,,570,4.18348623853211
1243256,4,B00000K4ZH,"Never mind the usual great voice work and characterization - there's an action/chased sequence in the middle that's authentically exciting. Really well done!
Some people might object to all the singing. Personally, I  enjoyed playing ""spot the showtune"".",964828800,,254,5.684210526315789
1243257,5,B00000K4ZH,"I got Wakko's wish from a while and Ive just watchet it a billion time! I love that story so differnt from a normal cartoon show and that's because some people shouldn't like it, but Wakko's wish is different cause it showh a hide side of the Warner that I love I love that the sibs aren't just a  crazy trio of little nuts but they can also show the love that wthey feel  each others All the cast of voice actor is great, first Rob Paulsen and  Tress MacNeille I think they gave the best!  I can't don't love all the  songs!  They're just great!  Especially the one where they sing about their  own wish!  Thanks Randy Rogel!  And thanks Tom Ruegger to made a such  wonderful story!  Now we just need more Animaniacs show!",957225600,2,723,4.235294117647059
7914264,4,B00000K4ZH,"I loved this movie as a kid, and watching it again brought back a lot of memories and I got so many more of the references now, so totally worth the re-watch. However, watching it now made me realize how awful the pacing is, you can tell the show is used to having like half an hour to fill, and that one wishing star song gets dragged on forever. Like its cool how they give all the characters a part, but it also bogs it down a lot. I loved all the songs too. But overall I think I prefer the show.",1500854400,,500,3.911764705882353
