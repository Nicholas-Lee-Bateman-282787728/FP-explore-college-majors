7688475,5,B01CQ8SYAG,"My wife who is mostly indifferent and mainly partial to rock or Blackmores Night, but when we finished watching this DVD she and I both had moistur in our eyes on and off ! Happyness or otherwise, Arlo just keeps getting better !!!! Saw him with John Prine in Evansville IN a few years back and he seemed almost ready to do that song but did not !!! This show has it all from Dad's songs now and then to his and everything you want to hear and with that same voice of his and sense of humor !!!! Priceless !",1474329600,,507,4.02970297029703

7688478,5,B01CQ8SYAG,"You will not be sorry if you buy this fun and nostalgic concert DVD.  It starts out with a Claymation video of The Motorcycle Song, and then switches over to Arlo singing live.  I was quite surprised when I saw him.  His hair is now completely white, and he looks a bit like Santa. LOL Never fear though, his singing and speaking voice has not changed.  Let's be honest here, we like him as much for his stories and rambles as we do his music--at least I do.  There are some hilarious moments on this DVD.  He is joined by a four piece band, including long time drummer Terry ala Berry and son Abe Guthrie on the keyboards.  Yikes, even Abe is not a kid anymore.  A bonus feature shows a fundraising walk for Huntington's disease, where walkers got to visit the site of the former Alice's restaurant, the church, the police station, etc. in Stockbridge.  Throughout the concert images are shown on a large screen behind Arlo.  These images includes scenes from the Alice's Restaurant movie, pictures from a children's book Arlo wrote, pictures of his late wife during a song written about her, and much more.  This is a DVD that can be enjoyed over and over.

7688479,5,B01CQ8SYAG,"I've always been a big fan of Arlo Guthrie since his first LP release. The ""Alice's Restaurant"" song had a great story with lots of humor and truth about the times so it begged to be made into a movie. It looks a little dated now but is still very enjoyable. The scenes of his draft physical are spot on. I went through the same facility in 1968 when I joined the Air Force instead of waiting to be drafted. Young men today have no idea what it was like turning 18 and having the draft hanging over your head. The song has endured and is a staple of his live concerts today. The movie is still fun and a slice of what life was like in the 60's.",1466121600,5,644,4.0

8753753,2,B01CQ8SYAG,"Alices Restaurant, 1969 film

Arlo Guthrie answers questions about his health for the draft board. Huntingtons Chorea is hereditary. Arlo plays his own music in class. The police question him about his friend. There is a scene in a restaurant, a fight caused a broken window. Arlo is suspended and hitches a ride with a trucker; on the road again. A church is de-consecrated and sold. There are changes inside. Other people arrive for a visit. The story runs on. Alice Brock owns her restaurant in Stockbridge Mass. Arlo sings his song about it. They show a dirt bike race. [This pads out the story.] There is a scene in the restaurant. Arlo explains Huntingtons Chorea - its not a war wound, but hereditary. Arlo visits his father in a hospital. Pete Seeger sings about migratory workers who pick crops. Then another scene in a kitchen

Alice visits Arlo in New York City. Arlo plays the music for his song. Two friends arrive. Ray invited people to that church for Thanksgiving. Things will be different, he says. [The gasoline prices and automobiles date this movie.] Arlo brings a donkey to the gathering. After the feast the garbage was taken to the town dump. [Do they still have these?] But the town dump was closed for Thanksgiving. So they dumped it at another place. Somebody reported this to the police. Officer Obie called Arlo, an envelope with his name on it was found under the garbage. They are arrested and taken to the scene of the crime. Littering is a crime. [Not a joke.] Alice bailed them out, their friends meet them outside. They plead guilty, were fined $25, and had to pick up the garbage. [No seat belts in cars.]

Where can they dump the garbage? On a barge that is taken out to sea. Arlo gets summoned for his Army physical in Whitehall in Manhattan. Was he ever arrested? Yes - for littering. He is sent to Group W, then fills out a form. One member has a problem with the police over his behavior. You promised! Shelly is told to take his junk away, and leaves. Cars drive on the highway. Arlo learns of his fathers departure from the hospital. There is a scene in a graveyard; a friend died in a flophouse from an overdose. There is a wedding between Alice and Ray, then a celebration and a feast. They show the activities in the building. [This pads out the story.] Ray plans to sell the building and buy hundreds of acres in Vermont. Are his dreams realistic? People drive away. Can you get anything you want at Alices Restaurant? Not really.

The song ran for 18 minutes, this adaption runs for over 100 minutes. Which was better? The movie is not as good as the song; your opinion may differ. Would you watch this movie twice? Its like a documentary about life and attitudes circa 1969 for some people. What did they accomplish?",1534464000,,2764,4.55533199195171

8753762,5,B01CQ8SYAG,I have not bought this yet but I was there to see it live and I go see Arlo every year that he comes through town.  He never fails to please.  I have been a fan since he fell into the hole at the Woodstock concert.  He tells so many great stories at each concert.  Even the stories I've heard many times come alive like it is the first time.  His kids also play at his concerts and add to the experience.  Folk Yuke appeared with him at one concert and I was shocked and then amused by their salty pros.  His daughter Sara Lee who is more country than I like is also very talented. His son Abe who plays key boards at every concert looks like he is so glad to be playing with his dad.  The rest of the band are all consummate musicians.  Especially when they play the old folk stuff from a million years ago.  Arlo keeps it alive.,1485129600,,830,4.0060975609756095
