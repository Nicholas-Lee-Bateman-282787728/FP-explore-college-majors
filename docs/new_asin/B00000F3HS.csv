7907103,3,B00000F3HS,"By the late '80s, just about the only slasher movies being put out by the major studios consisted of the seemingly endless line of big budget Hollywood ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Halloween,"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels.  Yet there was still an entirely separate market for viewers at video rental stores, where for a few bucks you could choose from among a shelf full of mostly no-name, low budget, direct to video titles that mimicked what was being done or had been done in the past by the major studios, just usually, not nearly as effectively.  I still recall as a kid in the late '80s staring longingly at the covers of the many slasher movie video titles that our local Mom and Pop store had to offer.

One obscure entry that sprung from this era was Anthony J. Christopher's ""Fatal Pulse,"" filmed in 1987 and released in early '88.  Unlike the trend of say your ""Sorority House Massacre"" (1986) to have some ""Elm Street"" derived sup-plot involving weird dreams and nightmares, Christopher instead went for yet another facsimile of the archetypal slasher template of the past -- a killer loose in a sorority house, with the young women involved being picked off one by one, and complete with your typical cast of males who are slasher movie stereotypes and always suspects to the crime.  In ""Fatal Pulse,"" you have your weird, middle aged Martin Sheen lookalike Ernie who serves as the maintenance man for the sorority.  You have your seemingly clean-cut Jeff who is also the possible perpetrator, along with his pot smoking, wisecracking do-nothing burnout roommate, who is supposed to provide comic relief I would assume.  In other words, if you're a slasher movie fan like I am, ""Fatal Pulse's"" script by James Hundhausen is something you've seen done many times before.

That being said, the movie is not however without some interest.  All of the  girls involved are very attractive, and lead protagonist Michelle McCormick has a certain appeal and is one of the few in the film who seems to have at least some previous acting experience.  And, as other reviewers have offered, the film makers made sure that each of these fine women (with the exception of Michelle) bared a bit of skin prior to their untimely and sometimes very brutal and prolonged deaths.

My guess is that ""Fatal Pulse"" was made by some young film school graduates with not much money to spare but a real desire to emulate slasher movies of the past and be as trashy and explicit as possible.  In that sense I kind of enjoyed it but in the end just found it a little too amateurish and lacking in real conviction and originality to really recommend it.  But if you want to see lovely half naked girls being drowned, electrocuted, and have their throats slit with 12"" vinyl records then ""Fatal Pulse"" does in that way deliver the goods.  Not really a good movie but I'd still love to see a legitimate DVD release of this.  Hopefully some underground DVD company will wise up and be willing to give digital rebirth to this long forgotten and rather controversial piece of video exploitation.",1304035200,3,3074,4.73921200750469
7907104,2,B00000F3HS,"Let's say you're a coed living in a sorority house.  In the past three days, three of your sorority sisters have been horribly murdered.  Would you go out jogging alone, at night?  No, only one of the many dumb characters in Fatal Pulse would do that.  Any of you who follows my reviews (as if anyone actually does that) surely knows my great fondness for 1980s slashers, including more than a few of the really bad ones, but I'm afraid even I have to come down pretty hard on this one.  As much as I love the 1980s, I have to admit it wasn't perfect.  Amongst all the great hairstyles, for example, there were a few that were downright hideous - likewise with the music, as the decade's musical greatness makes the few examples of bad 80s music sound all the more painful.  Fatal Pulse somehow manages to capture most of the few bad elements of the 1980s - heck, it even throws a talent-challenged adult film actor (but not Ron Jeremy, thank goodness) into the mix as a hapless homicide detective.

So let's see.  Someone is killing coeds from the AOK sorority house at the rate of one per day.  We can only hope that Lisa (Michelle McCormick), the prettiest of the bunch, isn't near the top of the killer's agenda (although that attitude may change after an hour or so of her whining theatrics).  Never one to let a crisis go to waste, Jeff (Ken Roberts) decides it's the perfect time to try and win Lisa back (after having dumped her for her slutty, recently-deceased sorority sister Stephanie).  That doesn't go over too well with Jeff's ex-best buddy Brad, who wants Lisa for himself.  Could Jeff or Brad be the killer?  Or could it be Ernie (Joe Estevez), the weird Vietnam vet who actually lives in and takes care of the sorority house?  What about the professor Jeff works for?  I figured out the killer's identity very early on, but I can't say the film makes it all that obvious (which is one of the few good things I can say about an otherwise terrible script).  All we really know about the killer is that he enjoys ripping girls' tops off before doing them in.

With Brad being some kind of refugee from a bad student production of Grease, you would think he would be the most annoying character in the film.  You would be wrong, as Jeff's buddy Mark (Blair Karsch) takes annoying to a whole new level in what may be the dumbest scene in slasher film history (believe me - you'll know it when you see it).  As for Ken Roberts, I think he must have been born with a wooden spoon in his mouth, as his performance makes an Al Gore commencement speech seem exciting - actually, I could say the same thing about the script.  No one in this movie comes out looking very good, with the exception of Michelle McCormick, but that's only because she's good-looking.  At least we can all be grateful that Blair Karsch never again disgraced the cast list of any other movie.

Even dedicated fans of 1980s slasher films will have a hard time finding good things to say about Fatal Pulse.  It's actually rather surprising that a slasher film could be so incredibly boring.",1276819200,,3071,4.472172351885098
7907105,2,B00000F3HS,"Not too subtle horror movie, where the murderer kills the girls in different manners. Entertaining, yes. Predictable, yes. But it seems to be intented to be predictable. As if the makers were thinking that ""stupid is clever"". It kind of works.

The mid-80's was fantastic. Jazzdance, bikes with drop handlebar, jeans that don't fit, t-shirts neatly tucked into the jeans.

A lot of nudity, which of course is morally questionable. At least it serves the overall purpose of the movie. Predictability. All girls who show their breasts on screen get killed, and noone who doesn't. In other words, appearing topless is what the philosophers call ""the necessary and sufficient condition"" to be killed.

While one may think that conscious predicibility is fun, and that stupidness for a purpuse is art, we may have to remind ourselves that fun doesn't necessarily mean good. And while ""stupid is clever"" kind of works, we also know that stupid is stupid.",1123113600,3,948,5.025477707006369
7907106,4,B00000F3HS,"First, this movie is bad.  But it is supposed to be bad, so take this review in proper context.
The one memorable thing about this movie is that the killer always seems to tear the female victims' shirts off before he kills them.  In one scene, he breaks through a door, pulling the female's shirt up enough to see her boobs during the process, and tosses her out the window.  When she lands, you can see the tarp from the air mattress shoot up in the air - the editing is awful.
In another scens, he ties up a woman, hooks electrical wires to her, cuts off her shirt, and electrocutes her.
If you want a good laugh with plenty of gratuitous boob shots/shirt rips, this one is for you.  Apparently the killer in this movie has a problem against chicks dying with their shirt intact, but in this case, that's not such a bad thing.",1033344000,7,829,4.294871794871795
7907107,1,B00000F3HS,"Fatal Pulse is a typical horror b-movie with a few exception. The typical parts are poor filming, an unknown cast and VERY bad acting. The cast puts about as much effort in the acting as a worker who just recieved his lay off notice. The unusal part of the movie is they actually show all the creative violent death scenes. Most movies just cut away during any such scenes.  Not a great movie, but each to their own.",997315200,3,416,4.333333333333333
