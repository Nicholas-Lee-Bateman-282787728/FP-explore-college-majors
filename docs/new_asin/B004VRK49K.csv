4484323,5,B004VRK49K,"I rented this movie at a redbox not knowing it had a spiritual message. You watch this and you think of all the people that should see it too! My family and I were so touched by this movie and were left with a wonderful heartfelt vision that left us not wanting to be the same.  I encourage all families with teens to watch this.  Your life can be changed because this story in its relevence leads the watcher to contemplate the reality of life, the choices we make and how if we let God in our lives we will never see things through the same heart.  The actors and dialogue were great!",1339891200,11,586,4.168141592920354
4484324,4,B004VRK49K,"I enjoyed the film overall but the first half has a lack of plot or story line. It was hard to keep teens interested through the whole film but I think the message that was portrayed was great. I wish Casey would have been a funny guy the way it was intended to be, his acting skills weren't the best. I think for a teen movie it needed a bit more action to really get their attention as well as get the point across. Good family film!",1330300800,3,435,4.011494252873563

4484326,3,B004VRK49K,"I suspect that most viewers who purchase this movie will understand that it is a low budget Christian film and will overlook the stiff acting. If you are a surfer, do not expect this to be a surfing movie. It's not. Indeed, the stereotypes and lingo are pretty much overplayed, and most surfers (Christian or not) will roll their eyes.

This is a Christian message movie and speaks directly to young adults who do not know Jesus. It also speaks to reinvesting in family. It is moderately successful in these areas. I believe that Skipstone Productions will get better as they go, just as the church back in Georgia who produced ""Fireproof"" did. But this remains an early effort.",1308096000,7,678,4.697478991596639

I work with at-risk youth on Oahu and this movie hit home for many of them. The message was clear and the gospel was presented in this movie. I love surfing and anything that has to do with water, so that's how I was attracted to this movie. Cutback had humor, drama, great story, great surfing clips but above all else it is a great movie that presents the gospel of grace and love.

4484338,5,B004VRK49K,"This movie is a very good example of God using a horrible circumstance for the good of those who trust Him. He has a very good reason for what happens in our lives, too!

He allows Luke to take a surfing position as well as Matt, which I think is why He let the deadly accident take Casey's life while saving Luke.

Luke and Emily apparently have a crush on each other (with Luke telling Casey ""there she is"" and Emily telling Jessica ""he's so cute""), but the friendship they develop is a Godly friendship. Which seems at one, two or three points in the movie that it could have been something more (like a relationship) as the attraction between them was very palpable.

With the help of his mom, dad, boss, Pastor Shane and especially Emily, Luke finds The Lord and chooses after accepting Him into his heart to follow God's Will. His mom and dad are so proud of him for making that choice. When he is with Emily out on the beach near the end (which is one of the points I was referring to), she too is happy he chose to follow The Lord God.

So this movie illustrates the importance of a Godly friendship, honoring your parents while still maximizing the gift God gives us and being true to our words. It's also about trusting that everything works together for the good of those who trust God and are called according to His purpose. And I am proud of his mom and Dad for teaching him the importance of respect and that there major necessities in life that can outweigh what we want to do.",1393459200,,1493,4.321428571428571
4484339,5,B004VRK49K,"Loved this movie. Great message of hope for the hurting. No indecently dressed women (i.e. bathing suits), just a good, clean movie. I recommend it to anyone and everyone!",1381881600,,171,4.931034482758621
4484340,5,B004VRK49K,"This is an excellent DVD ..... and well worth the time to watch it.

4484341,4,B004VRK49K,"I bought ""Cutback"" on DVD blindly yesterday thinking it was a surfing drama/sports flick akin to, say, 2002's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Crush-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JLH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Crush (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>"". It is and it isn't. The surfing and sports competition take a serious backseat to the inspirational coming-of-age drama.

Released in 2010, ""Cutback"" tells the story of teenager Luke Harris (Justin Schwan) and his parents (Greg Carlson & Raquel Gardner). The mother's a woman of faith, but the father and son aren't. There are signs of marital problems, but this is a very solid family. Luke's goofy best friend, Casey, isn't so fortunate (Angel Cruz). Luke's a natural at surfing and wants to pursue it, but his dad insists he goes to college. Meanwhile, a beautiful redhead catches his eye (Emily played by Kelsey Sanders) and everything seems to be bliss, and then...

This is a low-budget, straight-to-video film and shows some of the limitations thereof, like questionable acting by some of the peripheral characters (e.g. Casey and Luke's boss), but it's Grade A at heart. Seriously, this is a quality coming-of-age drama. Despite some of the questionable acting, I was able to buy into the characters and their story. The people became ""real"" to me because they ring true. Excellent job by the director, writers and cast in this regard.

What I especially liked was the overtness of things pertaining to God, like prayer and such. Mainline films (whether theatrical or TV) have to be ""politically correct"" in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Anything having to do with God is typically watered down, (but not always, see the pull-no-punches ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Death-Digital-Copy/dp/B004P2VQZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Death (+ Digital Copy)</a>"", as an example). Thankfully, independent films aren't as constrained in this respect and can therefore address ""touchy areas"" like God and faith.

""Cutback"" boldly shows the awful truth along with the gospel truth. Mistakes happen, anger is flared, divorce is threatened, tragedy strikes and intense doubts are vented. But amidst all this is the nobility of the central characters, which makes you root for them. Luke and Casey are bosom buddies, and it shows; there's a palpable attraction between Luke and Emily; Luke's dad is a weary cop who's understandably sick of being taken for granted; and his mother's a precious cornerstone of faith, but not without her own failings.

The film is also salted with inspirational scenes that are nigh life-changing. There's a potent discussion on integrity at a youth group that forces the viewer to check their own integrity; there's a marital counseling session that's similarly effective; there's a visceral response to tragedy and the equally visceral counter, albeit wisely subdued.

I'll be honest with you, this is one of the best coming-of-age dramas I've ever seen. It's inspirational, even enlightening, not to mention heart-warming and moving. The only reasons I don't rate it higher than I do is because it has the limitations of a low-budget, independent film, like dubious acting with the secondary characters, but most of the main characters are excellent or very good. Plus I don't want to mislead potential viewers into thinking this is some polished, big film. It's not; it's small, but it's Goliath at heart.

Most importantly, ""Cutback"" boldly addresses the most important issues of life -- ambition, compromise, folly, defeat, resolve, forgiveness, God, faith, love, loyalty, hope, death, grief and life.

All films are contrived in the sense that they involve actors performing from a written script. The secret of successful films is that they pull it off without seeming contrived; that is, it must come across as real life. Too many independent inspirational films aren't able to do this and, consequently, they're painfully awkward at times. ""Cutback"" soars above this, triumphantly.

The film was shot in S. California and is lean & mean at 87 minutes.

WARNING:  There was no warning to the dangers of ""missionary"" dating.  It speaks volumes to the girl's maturity in Christ that the fact that the guy was drunk was not a ""deal breaker"" for her in being interested in him.  This sends a terrible message to the young people looking for a possible relationship/spouse.  If the movie is trying to reach the lost, I can look beyond this major error.

I will say this: To those who put this movie down, ask yourself this: If this movie were about your life, would you want anyone to put it down? People live this life everyday. Immature lack of vision, selfish desires, disrespect for those who take care of you all lead to negative consequences. These kind of movies may tempt one to put them down because they may not meet our standards, but they do well to serve as a wake up call, or reminder that we need God. We need to see the truth. I doubt very many people truly understand or can imagine, all that God goes through to get our attention. This is just one of many ""stories"" that many parents hope their beloved children, or spouses or co-workers or employees will see and decide to turn their lives around. I hope and pray some, or all of this movie will serve as a wake-up call or inspiration, to many who think they have forever to decide: whether or not to follow Jesus. It is not ""Just a bad movie, or lousy acting, or low budget"". This movie is the vision of many people trying to reach the lost, the hurting, the confused. I say, Good effort. After all...Jesus is the one to impress with our efforts to join Him in reaching the lost and unsaved in this world. Enjoy!!",1506297600,2,1361,4.198473282442748
