5250811,5,B00930LJ1W,Good little horror movie. Don't panic (because it starts out kind of cheesey) and it just keeps getting better and better. It actually turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Makes for a good rental.,1352764800,3,216,4.425
5250842,4,B00930LJ1W,"Bigfoot exists. This is a movie not based on true story, but none-the-less Bigfoot exists and I would bet my life on it. You cannot have 5,000 confirmed sightings in North America and having every single person be a liar and hoax. Sure, some may be mis-identified or thinking you see a BF but its really a bear walking on its hind legs. But for the most part, these things are real, they are physical and not ghosts or paranormal. They have been around for a long time. They are in most States. They are the masters of their domain. They are experts in concealing themselves and they own the woods. They live under ground and in caves. There are at least 4 specieis of BF some aggressive but most not. There may be as many as 10,000 of these things that exist.  They are either Neanderthals that have been able to exist because of how stealthy they are, Or gigantipicithous (sp?)...or some kind of hybrid ape and indian. They exist in tribes. They run in numbers and clans, They never leave a GF behind which is why bodies are not found.  They see you way before you see them. IN the event of sightings,..its usually b/c the BF did NOT see the human first and its a random run-in.  They do not want you on their land which is why they try to scare you, throw stones, hoot and holler and mimic birds and coytoes.",1465430400,,1311,4.321138211382114

5250872,5,B00930LJ1W,"The Lost Coast Tapes is a well crafted found footage styled horror movie that chronicles a small crew of Independent documentarians on a hoax busting quest. The tricks and effects stay within a limited use range in the film which put most of the chills on camera effects and actor portrayals. The story is steady and doesnt waver in plausibility. There is a minor irritation in the fact that this is suppose to be such a big wilderness area they are in and yet they get to locations without camera pauses within a few hundred steps. That aside the location is creepy as hell and reminds me of a few episodes of X-Files with the freakiness. The creature is bare minimal in this flick so if your looking for full on monster assault then you will be disappointed but if you take the story as it is you will leave scratching your heads, thinking on a lot of cool new questions about the legends of bigfoot. For me this film is a great burst of new energy for the slowly exhausting found footage style. I wasn't disappointed by The Lost Coast Tapes at all.",1431216000,5,1051,4.422680412371134

Keep in mind that I'm not a lost footage fan. If you could imagine anybody lugging a camera around with them to document their demise at the hands/claws/teeth/hooves of a maniac, bigfoot, lion, tiger, bear or demon seriously, you might enjoy this film more than I did.
If I could give the movies that are even worse than this one zero star ratings, I'd have given this movie one star. Giving it two stars suggests that it's only a little below average.",1408492800,,620,4.535714285714286

Good question. You may think that a payoff for it will happen by the end of the movie. Nope, it's mentioned, and it's gone, never to be asked again. Which, really, is the central problem here. A good portion of this is more engaging then I ever expected, in part thanks to a lead that manages to be smarmy and self interested without being annoying.

However, even with a lacking shot of the infamous primate, it was a good bigfoot based horror film due to the good acting, lack of shakeing camera scenes, and dare I say a original story. I personaly don't see what's causeing such negative reveiws for this film. Of course its not a block buster hit, but what found fotage flick is?.. its a simple low budget film that strived to be nothing more.

I just glanced at the screen a couple of times when the screams got louder to see if anything vaguely interesting was happening...nope nothing past canned animal shrieking,  flashing lights, really bad acting and a complete absence of directing was visible. I had been hoping for a documentary or indie film of some kind, not a movie with no discernible plot, bad acting, an ending that made no sense whatsoever, yada yada yada.  I truly believe I  could have taken my own video camera,  my rescue dog and some friends up into the mountains where I live and done a better job..at least we  could have created an actual  PLOT and a discernible ENDING.  I can't imagine how this even got financed. I assume this group was going for a Blair Witch Project Genre?  Well...not even CLOSE and even though I saw Blair Witch's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, and didn't care for it all that much,  compared to this, Blair Witch was Best Picture of the Year material.  To the filmmakers of this, I have been in the music industry for years, some of it involving motion picture scoring. Show Biz is a TOUGH  gig, even for the Meryl Streeps of this world.  If you haven't gone to a bona fide film school or majored in a program at a major university, go NOW !  Go to every film-making, cinematography, directing, acting, and producing class you can find. Watch the BEST movies. START OVER by learning from the best, not by throwing out an ill conceived and thoroughly unenjoyable film.  Grow a thick skin, you'll need it. If you are willing to pay the price, and work hard, and most importantly, listen to people who KNOW how to make a successful film, you CAN have a career, but not via this route. There was nothing redeeming about this project.  This came across as a poorly thought out, haphazardly planned, badly executed attempt at a horror movie made by young adults  with irrational ideas of what it takes to do a film. Good horror movies, a la Hitchcock or Steven King take a LOT of work and thought, much more so than romantic comedies, etc.  I really DO wish you well....I didn't start out being good in this business, I had to work my butt off and had to learn That I wasn't always right. I put out some major projects at roughly your age and just cringe when I see them now...wish I'd buried them in the backyard.  I figured out very early on that those who didn't listen, didn't last. It's that simple, so find mentors and LISTEN. You can do this, but don't EVER do anything this poorly planned out again....improve yourselves !!  To  Amazon, take the price down, this is TRULY  a rip off on this calibre of film. I could have watched Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Stephen King for less...that's ridiculous.",1375488000,2,3046,4.491833030852995
5250934,2,B00930LJ1W,Don't get me wrong i like found footage movies... If they're good. This movie was yet another drag. It was very slow and boring until the last thirty minutes. You never completely see the creature. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was horribly predictable. The only thing I would rate positively on is the acting,1369526400,,324,4.701754385964913
5250935,1,B00930LJ1W,"Amateruish production. Like a wanna-be reality show. The characters were crass and at times smutty.

5250936,1,B00930LJ1W,"I believe in nearly 300 reviews I only gave 1-star to 2 or 3 videos. This one deserves a minus one. The acting, the senseless killing (the bus shooting was typical), the  bone jarring truck car chases, the ridiculous plot and the stupid reason for his arrest by some small town hick cop. To waste more ink on this video review, could only be worse by watching the video twice! I only rented it because of Charles Bronson, and I still think the best of him.

5250937,3,B00930LJ1W,"A camera crew, with no benefits or life insurance, is on its way to film real evidence from a man (Frank Ashmore) who claims he has seen Bigfoot and has a BF body. Skeptic Sean Reynolds (Drew Rausch) leads this production in hopes of making a reality series out of it. He is accompanied by his producer ex-gf Robyn (Ashley Wood) who believes in earth mysticism. Darryl (Rich McDonald) is the cameraman who admires Robyn and Kevin is the nerdy sound man who ""smells."" He is also a Bigfoot believer.

The characters and the dialouge I would rate as superior to most found footage films. Since they are filming for TV, the found footage aspect is above normal until the last 15 minutes of the film where they toss the camera around as much as possible for effect. This is the third or fourth film I have seen which duplicates the final scene of ""Quarantine"". Seriously Mr. Grant, all of us losers who still watch these crappy found footage films, have seen that scene several times before.

As far as Bigfoot is concerned. Fear not. The special effects did not break the budget. You see more of Mr. B. Foot on the cover than you do in the film.

5250939,4,B00930LJ1W,"Honestly I think a lot of people base their opinions more on overall production value of films when they consider how good something is. That being said, I feel there are films out there that don't get as much good press for the amount of work they put into them, this being one of them. This is a pretty straight up horror film with no real leanings towards actual evidence or science of any sort, and it also bears the pretty standard archetype of the handheld running camera spoofs that many of us have come to love over the years (although, they did manage to keep the shaking to a minimum here, something I really welcomed personally).

Keeping all of that in mind, I found the film delightful for what it is. The characters are generally fun and mostly believable, the location is nice and actually matches what one might imagine, the film quality is good and the story left me feeling entertained. When it all comes down to it, that's what I'm really after with most films. I will say I wish I'd seen more of the beasties, but I also understand leaving things deliberately vague and not expounding on your monster too much leaves people with a better overall impression than creating something and then having it come off as too fake or too hollywood.

I'm certain the cast and crew had a good time filming this one and I feel like they did a good job. I'm always happy to find a movie like this :D",1364083200,17,1405,4.420849420849421

5250973,4,B00930LJ1W,"As a long-time, die-hard bigfoot film fan I'm usually pretty critical of the genre. Despite what many of the previous reviewers said, I found the acting in this one to be okay: no better or worse than most of these sorts of films. The characters are mostly unlikable at first, but do grow on you. The movie itself is really pretty good on the whole. They touch on most of the usual bigfoot tropes but do so very well. The film is genuinely creepy and very suspenseful at times without relying on the old ""cat jumps out"" in a moment of staged tension. If you pay attention you catch shadowy figures move across the background from time to time, lending to the creepy stalking feel of the movie. The nighttime assault on the cabin is probably the best such scene I've ever seen in a bigfoot movie. It was great. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, which annoys some viewers. I was loving the whole thing right up until then end, which I found really disappointing; certainly it was a different approach, but I didn't like it one bit, although I THINK I got it after a little thought. Had it not been for the ending this would have been a solid 5 star rating for sure. Still, its a good movie in the bigfoot genre and worth a look.",1362182400,5,1238,4.3405172413793105
5250974,1,B00930LJ1W,"Wow. Seriously. I'm a HUGE fan of all things BigFoot and especially love hokey BigFoot flicks that I can sit back, enjoy, and harken back to my days as a kiddo watching Saturday afternoon creature features and ""In Search Of."" This puzzling collection of scenes (I won't even call it a film or movie) is really not enjoyable in any sense of the word.  Even really BAD BigFoot movies (and hey, aren't they all folks?) can be entertaining in their own atrocious ways.  But the underlying foundation of any BigFoot movie is...well...you know...BigFoot.  Not so with this peculiar video assemblage that wishes it was the Blair Witch Project.  Instead we have the 1970's era wierd lights and interdimensional meanderings of (apparently) demonic creatures that perhaps, just maybe, are fighting with (unseen) BigFoot and humans. I think.  But in actuality, I just gave up on caring about halfway through, when there had been zero BigFoot action and lots and LOTS of bad acting, especially the grizzled old fart they have playing the mountain man.  He reminded me most of the guy from Mark Borchardt's movie Coven (Google it) in overall demeanor and level of ham. However, whereas Borchardt's buddy only got a few minutes of screen time, the maestro in this flick has WAY too much screen time to practice his ""ACTIIINNGG!"" Predictably, none of the characters here behave like real people and none of the action is especially interesting, suspensful, or entertaining.  Again, there is NO BigFoot.  This blunt fact is even screamed at the end by one of the actors who hollers to no one in particular that ""IT'S NOT BIGFOOT!!!""  Great.  Cool. Ok. So why in the hell is the movie titled ""BIGFOOT something something?""  Is this like a final middle finger in the face of the paying audience? I have no idea and at this point, I've surrendered too many synapses to the pathogen that is this release to ponder it further.  I'll keep an eye out for the writer and director's next film, which I understand is to be called ""YETI something something"" but will focus instead on very aggressive, invisible salamanders.",1361750400,4,2096,4.856741573033708

5250976,5,B00930LJ1W,"As good as it could be for a formulaic concept.  Which turns out is pretty darn good.  The reality approach was filmed rather convincingly.  There was an interesting spectrum of different kinds of characters, some of them a little unusual and outside of the normal stereotypes.  And the drama and tension steadily builds to a crescendo.  I like how there was a lively mix of views about the subject of the bigfoot hinted at, but exploring the theories was never the focus of the film.  In the end, there was a complex set of well thought-out perspectives to choose from, and the storytellers let you make your own choice.  I particularly loved how you're dropped into a complicated reality, that there isn't enough explanation to fully interpret.  So the mystery is palpable, and there aren't, as the genre is usually plagued by, a host of familiar stereotypes that are recycled.  I thought the drama was well done, individuals are shown struggling with their commitments and priories and at times doubting and questioning them.
  I'd say, hands down, the best treatment to date.  They did such a good job with a topic that's of so much interest to so many, it makes me wonder why no one's done it before now.
  Hopefully there will be more movies in this vain.  Why not bring our myths and fears and hopes alive?  instead of just killing them with terrible stupid productions?  This treatment doesn't disappoint!",1361059200,3,1413,4.7727272727272725

5250980,5,B00930LJ1W,"Okay, in the same style as other ""found footage"" types of films, Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes does not have the best acting in the world.  The thing is, these folks are not supposed to be actors.  They are supposed to be people acting like actors which typically (in real life) leads to bad acting.  It is because of this simple premise that the film works.  The Drybeck character stole the show.  Also, the nods to Loren Coleman (cryptozoologist) were quite humorous.  There is enough horror and ""shock"" moments to keep many in the genre happy, as well as some images that are just plain cool.  I will not reveal any of them (because I want ot keep this spoiler free), but all I can say is: always watch the background!  Also look for the subtle imagery and foreshadowing (Hey, is that a pine tree with missing branches? What does that have to do with anything? It's called a clue to the reveal, pass it on!) I understand why the spoon-fed masses are so unhappy with the ending.  It doesn't give them what they expected.  True cryptid or cryptozoology fans will be blown away by the ending.  Yeah, all you other people out there who are bashing the ending, here is a hint: IT ACTUALLY DOES MAKE SENSE!  But I'd guess you'd have to read a book or do a little research on your own to understand.  The haters can go back to watching their Hollywood schlock (or maybe some hockey where they might pick up another clue).  This film is made for a niche audience.  I for one found it an awesome way to kill an hour and a half.  Recommended!",1358726400,11,1535,4.390070921985815
5250981,1,B00930LJ1W,"Say, have you seen the one about the young film crew that heads off to a remote cabin in the woods in search of Bigfoot?

Sure you have. Everybody has.

Cabin in the woods. Say no more.

And ""Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes"" has precisely nothing new to say, or add, to that threadbare horror clich&eacute;. Unlike, say, last spring's ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" which turned expectations upside down and inside out, ""Bigfoot"" unfolds exactly as expected.

Four 20-somethings -- a wiseguy director (Drew Rausch), his producer ex- girlfriend (Ashley Wood), his good-buddy cameraman (Rich McDonald) and a dweeby sound man (Noah Weisberg) -- venture deep into the ferny forests of Northern California where dwells a mysterious old guy (Frank Ashmore) who claims he's got a Bigfoot corpse locked in a box. Wanna see, kiddies?

Darkness falls.

Faster than you can say ""Evil Dead,"" they start hearing odd sounds -- moans, snarls, thumps -- coming from somewhere out in the trees. And then something starts clawing at their cabin's walls and pound, pound, pounding on their cabin door. Something big, and stinky.

Mr. Director Guy insists they film every second of their adventure, and faster than you can say ""Blair Witch Project,"" we're treated to jittery found-footage close-ups of increasingly panic-stricken young faces. Oh, no! Oh, my ! Oh ... aaaah!

See? I told you you've seen this all before.

If any of these characters were the least bit sympathetic, you might feel a twinge of empathy for them. Alas, no such luck.

Cookie-cutter characters in a cookie- cutter movie. You wonder why the people who made it bothered.",1358553600,5,1618,4.95925925925926
5250992,5,B00930LJ1W,"I don't know whats up with all the bad reviews on this movie, i watched it last night and during the entire movie all i was thinking was how awesome it is, and how i couldn't understand what the other people were thinking when they gave it negative reviews. You DO see bigfoot, just not clear or anything, mostly just quick flashes or he's off in the background, as long as you're not an idiot and have a set of working eyes you can see him plenty of times. The fact that you never get a straight up clear shot doesn't take away from the movie in my opinion, i actually liked it better that way. The ending gets a little crazy and over the top but makes sense when you pay attention. Overall i'd say this is one of the best bigfoot movies i've ever seen, so much of it was creepy because if you've watched anything about bigfoot before, it seems so true to life, until the end that is, but it displays all kinds of stuff like bigfoot nests, footprints, and everything else you hear about when people who search for bigfoot. Thats why this movie was so creepy to me, because most of it seemed so real to me. The acting was really good too, and very convincing, I'll be keeping this movie on my movie wall for sure!!!!",1357948800,5,1216,4.223175965665236

5250997,2,B00930LJ1W,"The movie has some good points.  For one, the acting isn't nearly as bad as most found footage movies.  Two, while the  characters still follow the horror movie trope of doing incredibly stupid things, there is an effort to explain why.  There was an actual effort in this movie to make sense of actions and events.  (Of course, this effort only makes the ending all that much more confusing and frustrating.)

Beyond those two....there's not alot to like about the movie.  The plot has huge holes.  Most especially the end.  Do not expect any kind of closure or explanation.  Maybe the creators were thinking of making a sequel?  The hints provided are unclear, confusing, and don't really allow conclusions.  Many of the lines are too melodramatic.  At points the overacting is laugh inducing.  Overall, watch it on Netflix or Amazon before buying.",1354838400,18,850,4.894366197183099
5250998,2,B00930LJ1W,"This train wreck of a movie already consumed more of my life in one viewing than I should have allowed, so this review will be short. The acting is, as one reviewer put is, one-dimensional (in fact, if you're interested in a great case study for one dimensional acting from an entire cast, this is it - though the lead actor and actress are perhaps the worst of the lot and would be better suited to cheesy commercials), there are NO scares, and they couldn't even make this remotely believable (and yes, I do get the irony in that comment when discussing a Bigfoot movie). I'd like to point out some highlights, but... well, I suppose the scenery is nice. Don't waste your time or money.",1354233600,4,688,4.468253968253968

It takes forever for them to get to the body,which the trapper has stashed deep in forest,but the suspense and killings were enough to keep my interest until a totally disapointing ending.

5251001,1,B00930LJ1W,". . .see ""Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes""!

This film consists mostly of a bunch of rather foolish, one-dimensional characters jabbering at one another; moreover, the brief ""encounter"" scenes are too abysmally stupid to even be good for a laugh. This film will catch many peoples' attention simply because they want to see something about Bigfoot, but Big Hairy never even makes an appearance, although there IS a moose hoof or something at the end. {I usually avoid spoilers in my reviews, but this film has already spoiled itself.}

The film shamelessly follows the basic plot-line of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B000KE5JES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;and uses the same ""found footage"" technique.

It's as if a bunch of people got together and decided ""Hey, let's make a scary movie this weekend!""
