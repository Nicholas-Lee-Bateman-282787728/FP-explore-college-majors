8489121,3,B005Y5NT4A,"At some points, this movie is hard to watch. At other points, it's lovely just to watch the cinematography. The plot doesn't quite add up, and sometimes that's good. Other times, the plot seems too random to really mean more than just total chaos. When the chaos is inventive, that's when this film is at its best. Sometimes the plot choices are a bit comical in a ""come on, you've got to be kidding me this is ridiculous"" sort of way.

All in all, if this movie focused a bit more time on building up character before descending into madness, it would have been a bit more powerful. Unfortunately, it seems these characters are fighting a war above and beyond what's sensible. Also, Vincent Cassel has a very weird-shaped head, which you get to see in all its hairless glory. So that's a plus.",1385769600,,794,4.513888888888889
8489122,4,B005Y5NT4A,"This movie is in French.  So you have to unlock your player to multi region to be able to watch.  After that, its crazy.  Its about people with red hair not getting enough respect.  At least thats what I gathered.",1339372800,,213,4.25
