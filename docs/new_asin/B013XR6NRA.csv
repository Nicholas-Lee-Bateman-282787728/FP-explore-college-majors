Here are two hunky guys, fantastic (non-cardboard) female characters, fighting the good fight. It has action, it has humour, there are no plot holes so large a truck could drive thru them (sorry, HUGE pet peeve of mine) did I mention the hunky guys? The sibling issues and ""greater good"" themes are always intriguing and lend a nuanced approach to the action. Sam - quit whining! (I am obviously in the ""Dean Camp"") The addition of the angel Castiel? Genius. Then, my favorite bad guy actor Mark Sheppard (*swoons*) as the King of Hell shows up ... and STAYS. I slipped away for that one wonky season - but I returned as a full-fledged uber fan - and proud of it. Every time I hear ""Carry On My Wayward Son"" I think of this show - and because it always pops as a seasonal thing - it brings a tiny tear to my eye. If I had had the time when the convention came to town - I would have been there.

Action, drama, comedy, and enough plot to make your brain do a happy dance.  Two badass men in a beautiful classic car battle against evil over a rock and roll soundtrack.  What more could you possibly ask for?  This set is going under the Christmas tree to myself, my mom, my brother, my friends, my coworker, etc.  :-)",1445212800,8,425,4.613333333333333
