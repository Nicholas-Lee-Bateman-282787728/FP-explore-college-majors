8706633,3,B00UGQMWRW,"This film version of the musical hasn't aged well.  Today it's more evidence of Hollywood's and society's racial biases at the time it was made - two white actors portray the love interests, despite Maria's ethnicity in the storyline and the availibility of talented Hispanic actresses.  Why wasn't Rita Moreno cast as Maria instead of Natalie Wood??

The story is rather childish for today, although the play will always be a classic.  Okay for historical sense, but today's young people will see the flaws.",1521072000,,508,5.011904761904762

8706637,1,B00UGQMWRW,"When this blu-ray was first released five years ago, it had a major glitch. This was noted and improved discs put out under a new UPC number. But I just bought a copy __with the UPC number for the corrected version__and the glitch is still there__five years later!

The glitch involves the image fading to back and then fading back in again during the overture. I have no idea if Fox is still replacing defective discs, nor how they can insure a fixed disc is being sent if they are now sending out the defective ones under the serial number for the fixed version. Are they just trying to get rid of the faulty discs any way they can??? This is really bad business on Fox's part.

Rating is for the disc, not the classic film.",1503273600,3,726,4.330882352941177
8706638,5,B00UGQMWRW,"Sorry, but I can't add much to what's already been said about this movie. It's a true, timeless classic and this DVD edition does it justice. Sound and video are both stellar. There are no caveats in my mind. I bought it for my 12 year-old granddaughter, a musical movie fan, and she just loved it! Her grandpa loved it, too.",1500508800,2,325,4.344262295081967
8706639,5,B00UGQMWRW,One of my favorite musicals of all time. Seeing this in HD blu-ray on my flatscreen TV was a joy and 1/2. I couldn't get over how good it looked. Well done and the extras are nice as well.,1496361600,4,188,3.8461538461538463

8706641,5,B00UGQMWRW,"The details were remarkable in this Blu-ray version. The following scenes illustrated this clarity.
.
OPENING SKYLINE OF NEW YORK CITY: The viewer was able to see the texture of the grass lawns and the asphalt cracks.
.
GANG JACKETS: The clothing exhibited creases, folds, lines, and stitching.
.
HAIR: Individual hairs were seen. A few were mis-combed. Frizzes were obvious.
.
ARMS: Purple veins were there.
.
FACES: Closeups exhibited things that makeup could not hide. These included pores, blemishes, lines, wrinkles, moles, brown spots, pimples, and hair stubbles.",1468886400,4,569,5.333333333333333
