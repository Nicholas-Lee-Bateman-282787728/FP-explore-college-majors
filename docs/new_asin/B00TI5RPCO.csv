7010203,2,B00TI5RPCO,"I've seen all the Bad Asses films and even though the previous two were good, I mean, I love watching jerks get their asses kicked by old guys, this one wasn't for me. The story was weak and unrealistic.
Even the explosion at the end of the movie didn't wow me, and explosions should wow everybody. It was so surprising to me too. It just felt fake, which I get it was, but you're not supposed to remember that when you watch it... that's what makes a movie good. I didn't even laugh as much as the last two films. I also knew who the main slimeball was right from the get-go too. Highly predictable, and so not in a good way but in a cheesy one.
I just feel at this point, a good thing has been had and done. No, it's time to collect the pension.",1429056000,,747,4.054054054054054
7010204,2,B00TI5RPCO,"Dumb fun. MINDLESS VIOLENCE AND Some  FUNNY Low BROW repartee. This is akin to Abbot and Costello with impossible  characters in improbable  situations pulling off superhero feats with marshal arts that do not exist. Foul language is gratuitous and grating. It is The middle teen macho verbal flexing that makes even an old Marine like myself, gag. I am sorry to see these two so fallen. Danny comes off as a hypocrite. He is known for finger pointing when others misstep on moral issues.",1428624000,,488,4.785714285714286
7010205,3,B00TI5RPCO,"As should be expected for the third film in a series whose primary joke stems from two old men foiling wicked plots and taking down younger, and presumably more capable, criminals in Bad Asses on the Bayou the gag is beginning to wear thin. The two previous entries in the series had a B movie, tongue in cheek feel that often evoked grindhouse cinema roots. The laughs were frequent, the chemistry between Danny Glover and Danny Trejo was palpable and their likability as they sprouted humorous bits about aging worked far more often than it failed. In the third film they are again the bright spot but the cinematic wilderness is decidedly barren with humor that only works in spurts, and produced more than a mere chuckle at most, and a script that is content to give audiences one action clich, and equally tired, scenario after another.

All of this may sound like I am being overly critical in a movie that just wants its audience to enjoy themselves and forget their problems for its brief 85 minutes. Often I tried to turn my brain off while watching but was directed to how clunky the fight scenes are put together, and still after three films I do not know if this has been a glaring flaw throughout the trilogy or was meant to be an ongoing bit that again parodies the duos age, but they seem to give it a low rent appeal that works more than it hinders.

There are a few dramatic, character driven bits of dialogue between Glover and Trejo, and a bullied youth,  that really help the film. They offer a genuine tenderness that isn't dressed in an overly melodramatic and flashy nature which provides much needed depth to these characters. It helped along the two previous films, both superior in quality and overall production, and it does the same here.

Truth be told much of this film moves with the same lingering pace, and in the same overall fashion, but the Baton Rogue setting (instead of the mean streets of the characters home town as was the case in the earlier efforts) and a wedding interrupted by a kidnapped mutual acquaintance of the two simply do not add enough new material to keep the audiences minds from realizing that the formula is gradually becoming shopworn and that Bad Asses on the Bayou really isn't much more than the third time this film has been redressed.

The film ends, after a rather unimpressive fight sequence finale which fails to get the blood pumping, with the promise of a fourth film. There is also a moment beforehand which promises the potential of an idea which may be unique if they continue to make the inevitable fifth and sixth entries. I will be perfectly content with this idea as long as writer and director Craig Moss finds some genuinely new ground for the pair to travel for as it is this third entry occasionally entertains, shows enough of a genuine camaraderie between the leads to have more moments than the hollow script allows, but one cannot deny the sense that it has been done before and that what we are seeing are variations of jokes already told and too many motions weve already been through.",1428192000,3,3072,4.608775137111517
7010206,5,B00TI5RPCO,Uber cool franchise of old guys kicking butt. Best Bad Ass film eva.  Love the dannys and lonny love,1426723200,2,100,4.2631578947368425
7010207,4,B00TI5RPCO,"Frank (Danny Trejo) and Bernie (Danny Glover) travel to Louisiana to attend the wedding of Carmen (Loni Love), beating up guys half they age and twice their size along the way. Danny Glover, who drinks, has had a liver transplant, and doesn't run. Carmen's dad (John Amos) is a Vietnam War vet so guess how that enters the film. Carmen is kidnapped, the sheriff who doesn't want to help in a town ""just a tad bigger than Mayberry"" becomes quickly a suspect in a film that would not qualify as a mystery. Mom begs our ""Bad Asses"" to find Carmen and the film goes through the motions of cliches and formula writing. Just tell me you didn't see the watch thing coming.

You don't have to have seen the other two films to watch this one, although I think this film would only serve the fans of the series as the writing is mindless formula fun as old guys beat up young guys and oh yea, they have to go to the proverbial strip club to find them.

This film is a soft 4 stars for the fans of series. It is everything you expect, but not much more.

Yeah the description says they are down there to help find a friend who was kidnapped but why was that person kidnapped that question was never really answered. seemed like it was a illegal moon shining operation and did someone find out and going to turn them in or what you don't know. good acting. not alot of swearing which is good. some catchy phrases and such but without the story line saying hey here is why that happened I had to say 4 star.,1485302400,,508,4.302083333333333

7010375,5,B00TI5RPCO,Considering my public name I am not really unbiased here.  I love the combination of the two Dannys.  I was a big fan of the lethal weapon movies with Mr Glover and as my public name shows I think Mr Trejo can do no wrong. Mr Trejo was magnificently comical and at the same time  intimidating and Mr Glover was so adorable I just wanted to pinch his cheek. In my humble opinion Mr Trejo simply wasn't showing enough skin enough of the time.  I don't care that he is now 71 because he is aging extremely well.  I was relieved to see that they had pasted a more believable beard on him than in the last Badass movie.  The last one looked like something Johnny Knoxville would have come up with for a jackass  movie if you know what I mean.  Plus the less of this glorious man that is covered up by clothing or hair the better. Lovely Lonnie Love was in her prime as the daughter of wealthy Mr Amos who is also aging remarkably well. I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining romp and loved the costumes they put these gents in.  All this movie made me do was want more of this comical combination.,1435881600,,1092,4.236714975845411

7010396,4,B00TI5RPCO,"Bad Asses 3(released Mar/15)stars,among others,Danny Trejo(the hardest working Latino actor today!),Danny Glover,John Amos and Loni Love. The Bad Asses franchise just keeps steam rolling along and it doesn't show signs of slowing down anytime soon. This is in great part due to Trejo's presence,along with his( now) side kick Danny Glover. With that great chemistry and an interesting storyline,#3 is a sure fire success.
The story this time around finds the two invited to the wedding of a lady who they watched over while she was staying in L.A.The guys get an all expense paid trip to Baton Rouge,La. The two are chauffeured from the airport to a beautiful plantation owned by the lady's father Amos. Along the way,at a bathroom stop for Glover,they stepped in to rescue a woman's purse from some local boys who wanted to take it for their own. All in a days work.
Once at the plantation the two meet and greet wealthy Amos and his family,reuniting with the bride. That night at a reception they meet the groom who is a former vet who is now wheel chair bound. After plenty of partying including lots of downed shots,the two stretch out on a couch for some shut eye. During the night the bride gets abducted. Trejo awakens and tries to prevent it going down, but he is outgunned and is knocked out. When he comes to Glover is standing over him telling him what he already knows. The police arrive and start grilling the guests,including the two guys. The police chief,a rather contrary sort,tells the two not to involve themselves in the investigation in any way or there would be consequences. That has never stopped the two before.
Snooping leads them to a local bar where they have to ""persuade""some customers as to the whereabouts of a certain individual. As their man starts fleeing Glover puts a shot into his leg and he drops. From here they attend an apartment where a feisty girlfriend of the new man they seek gives them both a run for their money,physically speaking. From here it's off to a restaurant kitchen where they confront the man who was behind holding the bride captive. After Trejo's remakes one side of his face in a deep fryer,the man tells them she is being held in an abandoned factory outside of town. Off they go.
Meanwhile the investigation on the police side is going nowhere fast. The crooks have contacted the family by phone and set up a rendezvous where they must hand over $5 million to get their daughter back. Amos attends the police station and waits for the police chief who never comes.
Back on the trail Trejo and Glover are lost trying to find the factory but the police arrive to help. Unfortunately this isn't the kind of help they need. They are soon handcuffed and put aboard a transport plane by none other than the Police Chief himself, who is in on the kidnapping scheme. It seems he wants the two dropped into the bayou,from way on high. They are guarded during the flight by two cops. The only other person on board is the pilot. The bad asses manage to over power the guards and the pilot. Trejo takes over the planes controls and brings the big plane in for a belly landing. When the plane finally comes to a halt after a long skid and break up, the two discover a motorcycle with a sidecar in one broken section. Its Glover at the controls this time and Trejo is the passenger. Off they shoot and they eventually find the factory this time. However they soon are discovered and just as the guard is about to shoot them, Amos shows up and bonks the guard into a deep sleep. The three then storm the factory,taking no prisoners and kicking butt. They get the bride but who should show up to break the party up but none other than the groom,who is now miraculously walking. It seems he the police chief concocted this kidnapping scam together to get the money. The three are tied to posts and the room and factory both are set alight. Just as it looks like the three are just firewood for the burning,in comes Amos' son in a truck to rescue them(he was hiding in his dad's trunk).
With the clock ticking on the rendezvous, the four race across town to get to Amos' wife who is waiting with the $5 million to hand over to the kidnappers. The groom and his men beat the four to the rendezvous. Just as she is being forced to hand over the moolah,the four arrive and send the groom flying to the ground. They get out of the car and take care of his henchmen just as the police arrive;two cops and the Police Chief. The Chief says he must kill all of them and is about to begin with Trejo, when on a nearby hill appears a large group of younger folks with guns,led by a clean cop. The Chief uses Amos' wife as a shield but it is to no avail in the end,as he is taken down by Trejo.
The film ends as Trejo and Glover have over stayed their welcome and want to head back home. Before they leave Amos pulls them aside in his office and asks if they wouldn't allow him to fund their project to clean up and take back the crime ridden urban environments. On top of that they would be put on a permanent salary. The two,gobsmacked,accept his generous offer.
I found this film to be a winner all the way. There are many more elements going on throughout that I didn't mention(for brevity's sake),such as the side story of Amos' son who is bullied constantly but in the end saves the day,Amos change from diplomacy to butt kicking, the bride's attempt to escape from the factory and getting a message out to the cops,the connection of the guys who they thwart taking a purse to the kidnapping scheme ,and others. It has a lot of things going on constantly to keep your interest and there are a few comedic moments between Glover and Trejo which makes it even better. Thank goodness the producers/writers of this film have not warped the two main characters to have them doing things their characters wouldn't normally do. Trejo's character has been true to itself from the first film,as has Glover's from the second.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There is a nice featurette included.
All in all another fine film in the Bad Asses franchise. There's good solid acting all around. If they keep true to the core theme as they go along,there is no telling how far they will be able to take this. I for one will anxiously be following it as it does. These are good films which are getting little to no write ups in the trade papers. They are virtually flying under the critics and viewers collective radars. There's nothing quite like being in on sleepers like these from the beginning. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1429920000,4,6590,4.487926727726895
