I love these out of the wall middle of nowhere movies he has done. I still don't see him as the next Jason Statham, but they are both good to look at and both my kind of action guys!",1322006400,,343,3.9855072463768115
3050298,4,B0010TDRLE,"I chose this film because Luke Goss makes anything he's in worth watching. I wasn't disappointed. The unforgettable cactus (nude) scene made me clench my jaw and squint through half-closed eyes, but I couldn't look away. The ending twist made me think back and recognize hints dropped along the way, and re-think the Goss character's reactions at many points, especially those leading up to the ""say-what?!"" end. Lance Henrikson was at his gritty best.",1313020800,,452,5.121621621621622
3050299,3,B0010TDRLE,"I liked the concept but the story line needed beefing up, for instance once you find out that Eddie was (or still is) a hit man and had Killed Jimmy's family cause they may have seen something then you are left twisting after that and this would have been the perfect opportunity to expand on the storyline in a way that made perfect sense of what was happening to Eddie I thought the choice of actors was spot on.

He is truly one of the greatest character actors out there and Luke Goss is really good in this movie despite how little there is for the actors  to work with story and plot wise, but still worth seeing -",1302048000,,644,4.235772357723577
3050300,4,B0010TDRLE,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The pace was good and the material kept me until the unique and unexpected twist at the end. Great value for the cost of the DVD.,1265760000,,172,4.212121212121212
3050301,5,B0010TDRLE,"Bone Dry is one of the very best movies Lance Henriksen has made since MillenniuM was canceled.  The drama and story line play out slowly but surely as you want to hate one guy and it all turns out differently from what you thought.  This IS NOT ONE OF LANCE'S ALIMONY FILMS.........Both he and Luke Goss put their hearts into this and it shows.  The commentary with the director and Lance is wonderfully funny as only Lance can be. Sometimes I watch it without the commentary but often just play it with the commentary.

3050302,4,B0010TDRLE,"I didn't expect this movie to be this good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This is an excellent movie.  Lance Henriksen was awesome and Luke Goss is an excellent actor.",1239148800,,170,4.633333333333334
3050303,3,B0010TDRLE,"At the end of this film, I felt like something had been lacking in terms of characterization. A lot of the dialogue felt repetitive, and I think that space of talk (and there isn't that much of it) could have carried a bit more heft. And if flashbacks were to be used (and they were), they should have shed more light on the man walking north in the pitiless desert in the hopes of saving his life from the merciless hunter on his back.

BUT...the opening is very nicely done. The supersaturated golds/yellows/brown that scream ""DESERT"". The low-key way the diner scene is done, and yet we feel menace in the air. It was nice to see Dee Wallace Stone again--a good actress who simply has not been adequately put to work in Hollywood, in my opinion.

Even better, we get to spend some time with gravelly-voiced, sad-eyed Lance Henriksen, one of my fave character actors. He's the relentless hunter. Handsome, hawk-eyed Luke Goss (Nomak from BLADE 2 and Prince Nuada from Hellboy 2) is the hunted suit-wearing man who is kidnapped after he departs from the diner (where a lonely waitress played by Wallace Stone hits on him rather kindly, and he similarly kindly rejects). A nice guy, we think. A family man.

But is he?

And that's the question (or one of them) at the heart of this pursuit film. Who is good? Who is bad? Why is this happening? When one man puts another man to torture and testing, we assume he's either justified (by some previous act, as in PAYBACK) or unjustified (as in VANISHING POINT). Either it's a sociopath getting kicks from torturing a human being; or it's an angel of vengeance. Or maybe something grayer, but all the same, landing somehwere in that range of unmotivated/motivated and just/unjust.

The notorious cactus scene is well-done. Luke Goss, whose past includes success as a cutiepie drummer for a band called Bros that was big in the '80s, shows that he can act without a ton of makeup on (as in the vampire mutant of Blade II or the tormented Elf Prince in Hellboy II). He has a lean, chiselled handsomeness that seems a shame to sunburn and torment. And he does a creditable job as the maybe good/maybe bad victim. I'd like to see him in other films. He's got an intersting face/voice, and I think he might do much better than some would expect of the recurring genre-film ""monster.""

By the end, we know the why. So, there is closure, although you are left to guess one detail, and I won't spoil it.

The direction is solid, if not consistently as stylish as the set-up and parts of the finale.

I think fans of action films (or of one of the particular leads) can enjoy this. But it didn't rise as high as I would have liked, mostly because space was wasted (even with a fastish pace). I did enjoy the look of some of the desert scenes quite a bit.

The bonus features were kind of pathetic, especially the ""making of."" Only a couple of places of the ""how tos""--particularly the cactus scene how to--made it worthwhile. It didn't seem as if much thought went into that aspect. But worth watching for those who want a sense of ""standing behind the scenes"" reality.

3050304,4,B0010TDRLE,"A business man absentmindedly sips coffee at a roadside diner, passing through a desert town. He leaves after sensitively rejecting a lonely waitress' come on, saying he's got to get home to his family. Five minutes later he's been pistol-whipped, knocked out cold and left in the desert with a compass and walkie talkie. A cold voice on the other end of the walkie talkie orders the business man to follow the compass heading due North. He has the man's wallet, ID, address and family photos, a high powered rifle and scope. If he deviates from these directions at all, the voice informs him, he'll put a bullet in his head and start ""cutting hands and heads.""  Thus begins a grueling, lean, mean trek across the desert filled with pain, cruelty and plenty of surprises. Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy? Why is this happening? This leads to a very satisfying conclusion that pulls no punches and doesn't cop out. Lance Henriksen is back in top form as the mysterious hunter, after appearing in too many inferior DTV movies lately. Luke Goss, a fine British actor, goes through Hell (you will not forget the ""cactus"" scene) as the unlucky business man whose past may be catching up to him.
