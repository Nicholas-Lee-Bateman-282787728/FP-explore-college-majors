8259732,4,B0015RRNK2,"AND NATURE LOVERS...THIS OVERALL IS A GOOD NATURE DVD TO KEEP ON YOUR SHELF.  MY NEW DVD WAS VERY CHEAP AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  THE CONTENTS IS MIXED.  THESE REMIND ME OF MARTY STOUFFERS' NATURE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE SEVERAL REPEAT SCENES...BUT...BUT, THEY ARE STILL GOOD TO HAVE IF YOU LOVE POLAR BRUINS. THE MUSIC SUCKS AND THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS'NT AS GOOD AS IF IT WAS FILMED YESTERDAY; I THINK THE FOOTAGE IS FROM THE LATE 90'S...HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE AN ARTIST AND LOVE ARCTIC SUBJECTS, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS DVD TO KEEP AROUND.  THERE IS NOT ALOT OF GLOBAL WARMING MUMBO-JUMBO PREACHING...THANK HEAVENS FOR SMALL FAVORS, AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SCENES WHERE ESKIMOS' POP A SEAL OR TWO...BUT THAT'S JUST LIFE. IF YOU LIVED UP ON AN ICE CUBE YOU WOULD CHEW ON SEAL BLUBBER TOO. OVERALL, I GIVE THIS NATURE SET A 9. 10 WOULD BE THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE WHICH IS THE ONLY THING LACKING...AND MORE VARIED FOOTAGE OF MUSK OX.",1395878400,2,934,4.476470588235294

8259735,4,B0015RRNK2,Old school production. More footage of the photographer taking photographs than needed. Good luck finding a segment over 20 seconds that doesnt include a mug shot of the photographer / narrator. Difficult at times to stomach the narrators/ photographers comments .. Especially about the starving polar bears rummaging through incinerating trash dumps with singed fur.. That being said I still give it 4 stars because I got to see amazing footage of arctic wildlife both on land and underwater. Seeing the sea ice and seals from the underwater perspective was amazing. It's a worthy purchase for the price .. But a big warning - it's environmental consciousness is quite dated.,1362182400,2,676,5.154545454545454
8259736,5,B0015RRNK2,"I absolutely enjoyed this. John Stoneman really captured the beauty and mystery of the Northern and Southern places he has traveled to. This is definately worth buying, especially if you are intrigued by Polar Bears.",1306800000,6,216,5.2
