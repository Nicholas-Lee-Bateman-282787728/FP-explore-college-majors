This is truly an accurate and incredibly well done documentary that shares the joys and heartaches of fetal surgery. Those were some of the darkest moments of our lives full of fear and anxiety. Our heart in being a part of Twice Born was to bring hope and education  to others in a time of uncertainly, loneliness, and pain.

Luelle is doing better than we ever hoped. We are honored to have been a part of something so much bigger than just us.

Please watch and share this show with others!",1471392000,2,560,4.41747572815534

8703533,5,B00TZF2O7I,"They say health is ONE and everything else are zeros next to that one but without that ONE, forget it all since all you have got is a ZERO. I happen to be a very active individual in many sports without any chronic condition with much zest for a happy life and I certainly have to admit that I walked away with more appreciation for that ONE after witnessing the experiences of life by those families and the journey of life that each individual had to choose with unprecedented love, faith, dedication and the simple belief of protecting life in this superb documentary by Monica Lang.

Watching those courageous parents, watching those courageous physicians, watching those true loving parents who had to sign legal documents and attend meetings where they had to make decisions about a complicated future that involved everyone in the family was way beyond any documentary that I have ever seen. These are incredible loving and caring humans, from physicians to parents who are so dedicated in the simple fact of protecting every single human life regardless of the cost that watching them in action will move you unlike any other documentary that you may have seen before as well. There are no words to describe what these angles experienced since no human can possibly go through such difficult choices in life regardless which option they to choose. It was truly painful watching that 23 year old mother who had to go through the analysis of her baby's condition with the physician in a small room with her husband. What could anyone say if they were offered such analysis of the future of their family... What is there to look forward if one is offered such a grim analysis of existence with so many limitations that will be impacting every member of the family for years to come... I have felt pain in my life but watching her cry like she did, cracked me unlike anything else I have ever experienced in life. I am truly speechless. I wish I could offer my life to her child so her family would not endure what was described by the physician in charge for years to come, but that is hardly even possible. This documentary is a reminder how insignificant humans power and control is in comparison to what makes this universe spin. It seems there is a purpose for what happens although it never ever makes sense in situations like these. I truly wish these people joy, the biggest gift of all from bottom of my heart.

The producers of this documentary deserve recognition for a superb job of presenting facts that many may not even be aware of or may not know about. I was mesmerized and glued to the presentation of this documentary not only when I was watching the documentary but more importantly when it was all over. This is a rare documentary, a must see documentary specially for those who may be missing the meaning of protecting life or giving life or can not appreciate the simplest gift of life, a healthy life. Health, what a valuable gift of the universe. Amazing documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1428192000,4,3017,4.669172932330827
