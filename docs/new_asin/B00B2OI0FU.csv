I'm beginning to think the Brits are one step ahead of us. First I find out that there will be an American remake of the UK's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mirror/dp/B00FKGOQWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mirror</a>, and now I hear HBO will be making their own version of Utopia. This is not to mention some older shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B00CEYPUAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>, which was rebooted by the Canadians.

Although not 100% original (it's a revamped secret agent template), Utopia does wonderfully well with the idea of a conspiracy theory so big that it will change humanity forever. This vastness contrasts nicely with the protagonists of the show, a very small but diverse group mostly drawn together by [what else?] the Internet. The troupe, which includes two child actors, were well cast (you'll recognize a couple of the adults if you watch enough UK television).
As the season progresses, viewers may be thrown into a bit of a conundrum about who to identify with (as more is revealed about each character and allegiances waver). Like life, Utopia is not black and white.

Excellence in television requires more than the visuals: it also requires appropriate audio (remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B008CN08ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>?)
Utopia's incidental music produces an effect as profound as The Imperial March (yet is absolutely nothing like the music of John Williams), almost serving as an additional character.

Negatives? Hmm, let me think. There is some graphic gun violence, which may put some viewers off. It's not a family show. Conversely, it's difficult to say enough good things about Utopia. ",1434758400,8,1874,6.358267716535433

(i can confirm that it works on PS4 too!)",1424304000,2,63,4.333333333333333
5553218,5,B00B2OI0FU,"This WORKS PERFECT in my PS4!! Best news ever! Probably will not work in most DVD players because of regional blocks blah blah blah but I bought these just risking whether or not they would play in my PS4 and they do.

OK, now for a review on the show, I am only 2 episodes in but 5 Stars all the way. Enough said. Buy these and ENJOY!!",1422316800,6,336,3.9411764705882355

5553220,4,B00B2OI0FU,"This is a really nice show. Concept, atmosphere and characters are great and it's beautifully shot and acted. At times had the feeling it lagged a little; at times the dialogue wasn't as fresh as the concept. That's my main reason to give ""only "" four stars.",1415750400,,258,4.51063829787234

5553222,5,B00B2OI0FU,"(Edited) Heard nothing but rave reviews from my best friend in China, I attempted to purchase it on Blu Ray, as it was the only option available and he's decided it's his all time favorite. Unfortunately as I live in America, and do not have an All Region Blu Ray Player was therefore was unable to watch it, I'm pretty devastated, my best friend and I have been trading shows since high school, it knitted us tight then, and keeps us close now, even now on separate ends of the Earth. If my best friend says, it's good, it's good! that's what i know. Just kind of wish I had known about the Region thing prior to purchasing, hopefully it'll make it's way to Hulu or Netflix.",1409356800,4,675,4.322834645669292

I like it.",1446422400,,41,4.25
8561581,3,B00B2OI0FU,"This should be available on DVD in the USA, but it isn't as of this writing.  That is OK - thanks to the miracle of the internet, I was able to buy a copy from Britain. ;-)  I wanted to watch it after reading that star director David Fincher had bought the rights and was going to do an American version.  This is a pretty interesting thriller with some ""hip"" elements - e.g. multicultural casting and comic books.  There is also a bit of the old ultraviolence in there.  The story gets pretty convoluted, and is not particularly believable - an unpublished comic book (oh excuse me, ""graphic novel"") written by a disturbed genius contains some dark secrets about a government or corporate scientific/medical program of some kind, and merciless killers are dispatched to eliminate anyone who knows anything about it.  A trio of young comic fans find themselves on the run, trying to figure out what is going on.  It is cool to see Stephen Rea and James Fox (whom I took to be his brother, Edward) in key roles.",1445299200,,1010,4.54696132596685
8561582,5,B00B2OI0FU,"We LOVED this series. So complex, yet so easy to follow. This is the most frightening show I have ever watched that doesn't have zombies! We were highly disappointed that they decided not to continue the series, but the two series they did make, are worth the watch and you can come to your own conclusion. I miss the characters, who I came to like and some to loathe.",1438732800,,368,4.3478260869565215
8561583,5,B00B2OI0FU,Very mind twisting and thought provoking. Interesting and starts with an instant hook. Second favorite british show under Black Mirror,1438041600,,134,5.75
