7835145,5,6303048927,"I can't get enough of The Flintstones, they bring back good memories when I was young.  My sister and I would meet our mom at the Hempstead Bus terminal to the 5 & 10 store and have a bite to eat and go food shopping.  Then we would go home to watch The Flintstones every Fridays on ABC.  It takes me back to those precious memories of my childhood.",1385683200,,349,4.028985507246377
