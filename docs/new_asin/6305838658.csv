7896356,4,6305838658,"This is the first of Art Hodes' jam sessions, featuring Jimmy McPartland and Eddie Condon.  Although this band is not as strong as his second session, it's good; and for the second part, there's a good duet with Hodes and the impeccable legend Doc Evans, which is a good PLUS for this tape.  The correct title is ""Jazz Alley"" (not Valley).",1170288000,,339,4.540983606557377
