2958776,4,B000VZADPQ,"This was the season that Will and Grace returned to what is dose best. Being a show about a gay man, his long time female friend and there two zany, yet lovable friends. Season seven of Will and Grace is nowhere near as edgy or groundbreaking as it was during it's second season. However season seven gives the audience a feeling that the show has come full circle and learned from any mistakes of past seasons and and as a result has become a well oiled machine. Not the shows best year ever, but is dose far surpass it's fifth and sixth season's and lays the groundwork for a even more enjoyable eight and final season.",1196812800,6,621,4.362068965517241

2958778,5,B000VZADPQ,"W&G is a fabulous show, I can't wait for Season 7 & 8 to be released.",1191542400,2,69,3.375
2958779,4,B000VZADPQ,"I don't understand why the person above me thinks this is the season where it goes downhill.  Did people notice that Friends was not so funny after its 6th season?  And that in its 10th season, it was really just scraping the bottom of the barrel?  W&G, in its 7th season, may have lost some of its ""HO-MOJO"", but altogether, still pulled off some great writing.
The show peaks from seasons 1 to 6, but bounces back with an even stronger 8th season, which, I am hoping gets released soon.
I have never watched a television show more times.  The cast is unbelievably talented and they all seem to have grown more naturally and maturely towards portraying their characters as the show progressed.  None of them ever ""acted"".
It is arguable that most of the time, Jack and Karen were the ones that were funniest, but without the balance and sanity that Will & Grace  provided, the whole thing would have been a vain and ludicrous showcase of a flamboyantly gay satire.
As a gay man, I find this show doubly appealing.  Not only is it hugely entertaining, but it also conveys several positive messages: that Homosexuals a)can be successful and productive members of society; b)are just like everybody else in that they value friendships and relationships; c)are people too and that they should NOT BE TOLERATED but EMBRACED; d)are truly members of the superior race because they enjoy the best of both worlds, are hilarious and great to live with, and, have impeccable taste!!!
Finally, one of the most touching scenes (season 8/A Little Christmas Queer) was when Will asked his mother why she cheered on her 9 yr. old gay nephew's christmas show while she ruined every one of his productions when he was a child by being so uncomfortable and unsupportive.  She replied, ""because back then, I didn't know the kind of person you would turn out to be.""
Will & Grace will always be remembered as a show that mattered and broke ground because not only did it make us laugh and cry with delight, but it also made us think about how we are all wonderfully unique, and how, at the same time, we are also still one and the same: HUMAN.",1191024000,49,2123,4.612732095490716
2958780,3,B000VZADPQ,"In my opinion, season seven is proof that Will & Grace ran two seasons too long. Unfortunately, a once-witty and original sitcom suddenly relied on flashy guest stars every week, such as Janet Jackson, to full the void left by lack-luster scripts. The guest stars in past seasons were used to complement interesting and funny storylines, however, in season seven, the show depended too heavily on guest stars to draw in viewers to watch dull episodes.
Honestly, I could not sit through most of the episodes so perhaps I'm missing the mark because I changed the channel too soon into the shows. I'm still giving the DVD 3 stars because I LOVE the cast, especially the hilarious Megan Mullally!!!
The promised ""Loaded with extra features"" will most likely once again be a lie as previous DVD's have demonstrated. ""Themed featurettes"" with clips of the season's shows set to music are not EXTRA features... Hopefully the final season will offer up some better bonus material to make up for the season sets.",1189814400,11,1003,4.871345029239766

2958797,1,B000VZADPQ,"I'm a straight guy who likes Will and Grace. Megan Mullally is hilarious (you should see her on Parks and Recreation). IMO, the first 4 seasons of Will and Grace were funnier than Friends (and Friends is pretty funny). I liked the chemistry between the characters. Jack was the flamboyantly gay guy while Will was the more conservative gay guy. Will and Grace were the non-sexual life partners. Karen always made fun of how Grace dressed. She also verbally abused Jack and Rosario. They stuck to that template for the first 4 seasons and this was the funniest show in the NBC Thursday lineup. Then, the show went downhill.

The show peaked during the episode when Will and Grace had their big fight when Grace refused to have a baby with Will because she wanted to be in a relationship with Leo. Harry Connick Jr. killed the show. Seasons 6, 7, and 8 were basically a bunch of flavor-of-the-week guest stars and unrealistic storylines (Jack becoming a back up dancer for Janet Jackson...). The show should've just ended on a high note after season 6.",1443744000,,1050,4.675675675675675

However, this still remains one of the best shows to grace the T.V. screen. There are a few standout episodes and the characters begin preparing for Season 8, their final season. I particularly felt 'Grace' led many of the episodes in the season. While she isn't my favorite character, I felt she helps make this season more enjoyable. Definitely worth your money and certainly a must for any collecter. The Thanksgiving episode with 'Vince's' family is one of the best of all 8 seasons, which makes this a must have!

Will got stupid he was always the sane and smart one. Grace looked like she don't want to even be on the show after her pregnancy. Karen and Jack got dumb and dumberer. The first four seasons were very believeable story lines. I though the series finale was junk to.

The divorce of Grace and Leo is sad but continues with the purpose of the show. Jack and Karen are at their best and Will has definitely developed into a strong character.

2958938,5,B000VZADPQ,"Ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a genuinely complete season of our beloved WILL & GRACE on DVD! After buying the DVDs for seasons 3-6 only to find that nearly all of the ""super size"" episodes and many of the hour-long episodes were the syndicated versions on the DVD, NBC seems to have gotten their act together and put together a long-overdue quality DVD release with season 7. The ""super size"" season premier, ""FYI: I Hurt, Too"" and the hour-long ""Queens For a Day"" are both fully intact with no scenes cut and are presented in their complete original broadcast versions.

As for the season itself, I'm in the minority of W&G fans by really liking this season. Many fans claim that season 7 is their least favorite, but I think of it as the recovery season, or the comeback season, if you will. Like another reviewer said, this season the show returned to the basics, which is all the show ever needed, if you ask me. I think the show's genuine problems were found in seasons 5 and 6: Grace married Leo, Karen dated and subsequently married Lyle, and Debra Messing's absence throughout season 6 due to her pregnancy definitely took its toll on the overall quality and dynamics of the show. Seasons 5 and 6 certainly had great episodes, but they also had their share of duds which precipitated the show's decline in ratings and quality.

What works about season 7 is that it is complex, proportionately mixed with comedy and drama: Grace getting over her failed marriage to Leo and Karen getting over her husband's death and her failed brief marriage to Lyle, all underlying the comedic situations that Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen usually find themselves in. I especially like how no time is wasted stringing Leo along-- he disappears after the first episode! Near the end of the season premier Grace appears at Will's door with an overnight bag and says, ""I just couldn't. It's over."" It's a heart-wrenching scene that lasts about 30 seconds, but it's one of the most real and touching scenes in the entire series. Grace's marriage was over and she relied on Will, her best friend, to catch her fall.

What doesn't work about season 7 is the gratuitous celebrity guest stars. I don't begrudge the show for this, rather it's the fault of the network for forcing the show to accommodate guest stars. Lily Tomlin, Sharon Stone, Jeff Goldblum, and Molly Shannon were great (""Partners"" with Lily Tomlin is one of my favorite episodes of the season and series), but there was no need for another appearance by Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson's appearance was beyond ridiculous and unnecessary, and the part of Vince's best friend ""Nadine"" could have been a much more unique and interesting character had Kristen Davis not been cast in the role, who landed the part solely on the basis of her recent SEX AND THE CITY fame.

Considering the quality of the DVD release and the season itself, I think it deserves 5 stars, simply for fact that there are no edited episodes to be found. Despite the fact that there are very few extras, I can enjoy this season, in its entirety on DVD, for what it was. Season 7 wasn't the show's greatest season, but it rectified the problems presented in previous seasons and set the show up for its superb final season.",1196985600,31,3249,4.6947368421052635
3193273,4,B000VZADPQ,"This was the season that Will and Grace returned to what is dose best. Being a show about a gay man, his long time female friend and there two zany, yet lovable friends. Season seven of Will and Grace is nowhere near as edgy or groundbreaking as it was during it's second season. However season seven gives the audience a feeling that the show has come full circle and learned from any mistakes of past seasons and and as a result has become a well oiled machine. Not the shows best year ever, but is dose far surpass it's fifth and sixth season's and lays the groundwork for a even more enjoyable eight and final season.",1196812800,6,621,4.362068965517241

3193276,4,B000VZADPQ,"I don't understand why the person above me thinks this is the season where it goes downhill.  Did people notice that Friends was not so funny after its 6th season?  And that in its 10th season, it was really just scraping the bottom of the barrel?  W&G, in its 7th season, may have lost some of its ""HO-MOJO"", but altogether, still pulled off some great writing.
The show peaks from seasons 1 to 6, but bounces back with an even stronger 8th season, which, I am hoping gets released soon.
I have never watched a television show more times.  The cast is unbelievably talented and they all seem to have grown more naturally and maturely towards portraying their characters as the show progressed.  None of them ever ""acted"".
It is arguable that most of the time, Jack and Karen were the ones that were funniest, but without the balance and sanity that Will & Grace  provided, the whole thing would have been a vain and ludicrous showcase of a flamboyantly gay satire.
As a gay man, I find this show doubly appealing.  Not only is it hugely entertaining, but it also conveys several positive messages: that Homosexuals a)can be successful and productive members of society; b)are just like everybody else in that they value friendships and relationships; c)are people too and that they should NOT BE TOLERATED but EMBRACED; d)are truly members of the superior race because they enjoy the best of both worlds, are hilarious and great to live with, and, have impeccable taste!!!
Finally, one of the most touching scenes (season 8/A Little Christmas Queer) was when Will asked his mother why she cheered on her 9 yr. old gay nephew's christmas show while she ruined every one of his productions when he was a child by being so uncomfortable and unsupportive.  She replied, ""because back then, I didn't know the kind of person you would turn out to be.""
Will & Grace will always be remembered as a show that mattered and broke ground because not only did it make us laugh and cry with delight, but it also made us think about how we are all wonderfully unique, and how, at the same time, we are also still one and the same: HUMAN.",1191024000,49,2123,4.612732095490716
3193277,3,B000VZADPQ,"In my opinion, season seven is proof that Will & Grace ran two seasons too long. Unfortunately, a once-witty and original sitcom suddenly relied on flashy guest stars every week, such as Janet Jackson, to full the void left by lack-luster scripts. The guest stars in past seasons were used to complement interesting and funny storylines, however, in season seven, the show depended too heavily on guest stars to draw in viewers to watch dull episodes.
Honestly, I could not sit through most of the episodes so perhaps I'm missing the mark because I changed the channel too soon into the shows. I'm still giving the DVD 3 stars because I LOVE the cast, especially the hilarious Megan Mullally!!!
The promised ""Loaded with extra features"" will most likely once again be a lie as previous DVD's have demonstrated. ""Themed featurettes"" with clips of the season's shows set to music are not EXTRA features... Hopefully the final season will offer up some better bonus material to make up for the season sets.",1189814400,11,1003,4.871345029239766

3193294,1,B000VZADPQ,"I'm a straight guy who likes Will and Grace. Megan Mullally is hilarious (you should see her on Parks and Recreation). IMO, the first 4 seasons of Will and Grace were funnier than Friends (and Friends is pretty funny). I liked the chemistry between the characters. Jack was the flamboyantly gay guy while Will was the more conservative gay guy. Will and Grace were the non-sexual life partners. Karen always made fun of how Grace dressed. She also verbally abused Jack and Rosario. They stuck to that template for the first 4 seasons and this was the funniest show in the NBC Thursday lineup. Then, the show went downhill.

The show peaked during the episode when Will and Grace had their big fight when Grace refused to have a baby with Will because she wanted to be in a relationship with Leo. Harry Connick Jr. killed the show. Seasons 6, 7, and 8 were basically a bunch of flavor-of-the-week guest stars and unrealistic storylines (Jack becoming a back up dancer for Janet Jackson...).

However, this still remains one of the best shows to grace the T.V. screen. There are a few standout episodes and the characters begin preparing for Season 8, their final season. I particularly felt 'Grace' led many of the episodes in the season. While she isn't my favorite character, I felt she helps make this season more enjoyable. Definitely worth your money and certainly a must for any collecter. The Thanksgiving episode with 'Vince's' family is one of the best of all 8 seasons, which makes this a must have! Will & Grace' remains a winner!",1225324800,,664,4.541666666666667

3193423,1,B000VZADPQ,Yep this show went downhill..pretty much in the middle of season 5. I only own 1-4. None of the shows were very relastic to me. Very slapstick. Will got stupid he was always the sane and smart one. Grace looked like she don't want to even be on the show after her pregnancy. Karen and Jack got dumb and dumberer. The first four seasons were very believeable story lines. I though the series finale was junk to. Just a great show that once was and went on to long with no good storylines.,1209254400,2,487,4.247311827956989

Madonna, Cher, Michael Douglas, Elton John, Harry Connick Jr., Rip Torn, Glen Close, Woody Harrelson and more. My favorite guest star was Greogory Hines, who has since passed away. May he rest in peace.
Personally, I enjoy Karyn and Jack the most, and wish I could change the title to Jack & Karyn.  The show is laugh out loud funny. Highly, highly recommend.",1200787200,,526,4.844444444444444

Sometimes we have Will and Grace marathons 5-6 shows in a row and it's great.  This show should have never gone off the air.

The story lines are creative considering they were in their 7th year and trying to keep the central theme since season one intact.  The divorce of Grace and Leo is sad but continues with the purpose of the show. Jack and Karen are at their best and Will has definitely developed into a strong character.  Grace was weaker in this season, but still a strong figure for the series.",1199059200,,539,4.404040404040404

3193435,5,B000VZADPQ,"Ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a genuinely complete season of our beloved WILL & GRACE on DVD! After buying the DVDs for seasons 3-6 only to find that nearly all of the ""super size"" episodes and many of the hour-long episodes were the syndicated versions on the DVD, NBC seems to have gotten their act together and put together a long-overdue quality DVD release with season 7. The ""super size"" season premier, ""FYI: I Hurt, Too"" and the hour-long ""Queens For a Day"" are both fully intact with no scenes cut and are presented in their complete original broadcast versions.

As for the season itself, I'm in the minority of W&G fans by really liking this season. Many fans claim that season 7 is their least favorite, but I think of it as the recovery season, or the comeback season, if you will. Like another reviewer said, this season the show returned to the basics, which is all the show ever needed, if you ask me. I think the show's genuine problems were found in seasons 5 and 6: Grace married Leo, Karen dated and subsequently married Lyle, and Debra Messing's absence throughout season 6 due to her pregnancy definitely took its toll on the overall quality and dynamics of the show. Seasons 5 and 6 certainly had great episodes, but they also had their share of duds which precipitated the show's decline in ratings and quality.

What works about season 7 is that it is complex, proportionately mixed with comedy and drama: Grace getting over her failed marriage to Leo and Karen getting over her husband's death and her failed brief marriage to Lyle, all underlying the comedic situations that Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen usually find themselves in. I especially like how no time is wasted stringing Leo along-- he disappears after the first episode! Near the end of the season premier Grace appears at Will's door with an overnight bag and says, ""I just couldn't. It's over."" It's a heart-wrenching scene that lasts about 30 seconds, but it's one of the most real and touching scenes in the entire series. Grace's marriage was over and she relied on Will, her best friend, to catch her fall.

What doesn't work about season 7 is the gratuitous celebrity guest stars. I don't begrudge the show for this, rather it's the fault of the network for forcing the show to accommodate guest stars. Lily Tomlin, Sharon Stone, Jeff Goldblum, and Molly Shannon were great (""Partners"" with Lily Tomlin is one of my favorite episodes of the season and series), but there was no need for another appearance by Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson's appearance was beyond ridiculous and unnecessary, and the part of Vince's best friend ""Nadine"" could have been a much more unique and interesting character had Kristen Davis not been cast in the role, who landed the part solely on the basis of her recent SEX AND THE CITY fame.

Considering the quality of the DVD release and the season itself, I think it deserves 5 stars, simply for fact that there are no edited episodes to be found. Despite the fact that there are very few extras, I can enjoy this season, in its entirety on DVD, for what it was. Season 7 wasn't the show's greatest season, but it rectified the problems presented in previous seasons and set the show up for its superb final season.",1196985600,31,3249,4.6947368421052635
