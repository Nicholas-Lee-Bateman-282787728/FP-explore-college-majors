8121348,5,B000FDXB7Q,"My son is two and he loves this DvD.  He loves to watch the ""doggie"" and laughs and basically just adores this show.  I do not find it so great, as it is obvious that it is a foreign film.  But what can I say.  My son could watch this 15 times a day and still want more.",1188777600,,270,3.603448275862069

In fact it is even better that the VHS title. It has several episodes  than the VHS format does not have; I Highly recommended.",1183420800,2,198,4.076923076923077
