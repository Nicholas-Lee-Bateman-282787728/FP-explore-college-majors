5181919,5,B008TYGDIW,Personally I am very pleased that I will be getting game 5 of the NLCS. I want Z's gem to own.  And NLCS Game 7 is on the world series film which is brilliant BTW!,1354752000,4,163,3.657142857142857
5181920,5,B008TYGDIW,"They included the entire Game 7 of the NLCS on the World Series Film disk, so including it here would be a duplication.",1354579200,2,119,4.217391304347826
5181921,5,B008TYGDIW,"I was initially disappointed that the bonus disc is Game 5 and not Game 7 of the NLCS.  But I just got my copy of the MLB Official 2012 World Series Film 2-disc set ""World Series Champions"" from amazon, and THAT bonus disc includes Game 7 of the NLCS.  So if you purchase both, like I did, you'll have both Game 5 with Zito and Game 7 in the rain, plus all of the WS games.",1354492800,47,373,3.8947368421052633
5181922,2,B008TYGDIW,I am with the first reviewer - I was hoping that they would include game 7 of the NLCS with the rain and celebration.  I am very disappointed. I probably won't be buying this after all. A four game World Series and they don't even include the deciding game of the NLCS!!! Come On!!!,1353715200,6,282,4.222222222222222
5181923,5,B008TYGDIW,"Didn't think it would ever happen, and now we have TWO!

Five stars for such a great subject, and of course I'll be getting one, but instead of Matt Cain's perfect game (available separately), I think a more fitting example of Giants playoff baseball in microcosm would be ...

... Game Three against the Reds.  We were down two games to none, on the road, and they had Vogey on the ropes early.  But they couldn't put him away, we got the tying run while Homer Bailey was throwing a no-hitter, and clawed out the game winner in extra innings with an error to help us.  We won with three hits.  Classic game, and it deserves to be included in my opinion.  More nerve-wracking than Game Four of the World Series, which was pretty tense.  Matt Cain winning 12-0 and striking out gazillions while not letting anyone reach was awesome, but too easy.  This is the Giants, after all.

Like the choice of Zito's great effort though.  My three extras would have been - Game Three NLDS and Games Five and Seven of NLCS.  All four World Series games make the set a must for us all.",1353369600,11,1071,4.380710659898477

5181930,5,B008TYGDIW,"As a third-generation New York/San Francisco Giants fan, this season was one of the best of my life, as the Giants accomplished two things they had never done in their 130-year history:

A Giant pitcher fired a perfect game. (No, Mathewson, Marquard, Hubbell, Maglie, Marichal, Perry, Resuchel, Hammaker, Dravecky, Garrelts, Swift, Burkett, and Jason Schmidt never did it. It took Matt Cain)

The Giants won the seventh game of a post-season series. My grandfather sat through the World Series disasters of 1912 and 1924, in the flesh. Dad had to cope with 1962 (made harder by the fact that his other favorite team was the Yankees, who won it), and I had to deal with the 1987 NLCS and the 2002 World Series.

They did so the hard way, putting up with Melky Cabrera being suspended for steroid use (which explained his huge numbers) and falling behind in the NLCS 3 games to 1. But once the World Series came against the unbelievably powerful Detroit Tigers, the Giant pitchers dominated the scene, taking the Series in four games, never even falling behind in a game (vengeance for the 1989 World Series, when the Giants never had a lead in a single inning!)

The DVD quality is superb. It includes Matt Cain's perfecto, three key games from the NLDS and NLCS, including the NLCS clincher, the entire Series, and some highlights.

The audio can be the Fox broadcast, which is barely tolerable for its endless stupidity and promotion of Fox shows, a Latino broadcast (a good thing to do), the Tigers broadcast (listen to them face the agony of defeat) or the Giants broadcast of Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow (which all Giant fans want to hear). Just what a Giants fan would want on his or her shelf.

It's just as perfect as a Giants World Series DVD can be!",1427241600,2,1759,4.658064516129032

5181940,4,B008TYGDIW,"Nice set. I wonder why some pitches are left out (for instance, right after Sandoval grounds out to Fielder in 3d inning of game 3, Posey watches ball 3 go by). This happens not just in this set, but several other world series editions as well. You can also tell that some of the announcer banter between pitches is occasionally ommitted.

I don't if it's because the Giants beat the Tigers in 4 strait games and there was more room in the package but it also included Game's 5 of the NLDS AND NLCS and Matt Cain's perfect game and an additional dvd for best of the Giants in 2012.  The World Series games are available to play with the Giants announcers which is SO much better than listening to the Fox announcers.  I love it.  It was my Christmas present to myself.

5181986,5,B008TYGDIW,"Look, I am a fanboy when it comes to these things. Watching this 2012 World Series Collection on Bluray makes this better than any of the discs on the 2010 collection. The picture is sharp and brilliant. The Phantom Cam - the super-slo-mo camera - is awesome (Romo's victory dances on the mound, Panda's 3 homers, Scutaro in the rain -- all iconic shots!) The 2010 collection only had every broadcast on the WS discs. Not here. Getting to listen to all of the broadcasts on the LDS & LCS discs is great, too - it's worth it just alone to hear the disappointment on the Reds and Cards sides. I love the fact that MLB added Cain's perfect game to the mix. I played the Spanish broadcast of Blanco's catch for my 10-year old daughter - she loved it.

However...

I would have preferred this set feature Game 6 of the LCS, Ryan Vogelsong's greatest game as a pitcher. Game 5 of the LDS was historic, sure. But along with Game 7 on the Official WS Film, and three of Cain's postseason games (perfect game, Game 5 LDS, Game 4 of the WS are all on this collection) are featured for all of posterity. Having Zito's LCS Game 5 is essential. But Vogelsong winning Game 6 was just as important. He both shut down and beat down the Cardinals with his 9 strikeouts. had MLB done this, they would have had all seven consecutive games the Giants won to finish the postseason.

Disc 8 could have featured some more highlights of the Giants season. I would also like to have seen a complete section of shots from the Phantom Cam.

Still, this is a must for any Giants fan - or for any fan who likes good team baseball. I hope that MLB puts out other World Series discs (well, 2010) on Blu Ray, too.",1357171200,19,1681,4.310126582278481

- Walk-off wins (I think I counted five of them)
- Season Highlights: Pitching Highlights (excluding the Perfect Game which is on a separate disc), 20-Game Hit Streaks (Sandoval, Pagan, Scutaro), NL West Clinch Game
- Postseason Highlights: NLDS Games 3, 4, NLCS Games 2, 6, 7 (includes postgame celebration)

The other seven discs are as described in the product description. Each disc has multiple audio options: original TV announcers, Giants announcers, Reds/Cards/Tiger announcers. For the WS games and Cain's perfect game you even get a Spanish option. For a Giants fan it's actually kinda fun to watch the games with the Reds/Cards/Tigers announcers because it gives you a different perspective of someone rooting against the Giants. Lots of props to the Tigers announcers for their call at the end of the WS. Not so good for the Reds and Cards announcers who couldn't disguise their disappointments.
