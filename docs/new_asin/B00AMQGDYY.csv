5451402,5,B00AMQGDYY,Canadian bacon is one of my all time fav movies and so glad that amazon had this in DVD form. It plays great...,1407110400,,111,3.869565217391304
5451403,4,B00AMQGDYY,great DVD - hope ya like dry humor - I love it,1405728000,,46,2.9166666666666665
5451404,2,B00AMQGDYY,but if you like silly comedies you'll like it. Husband rented and liked it . I thought it stupid . Matter of what you like.,1401926400,,123,3.96
5451405,5,B00AMQGDYY,"Canadian Bacon:  This is a pre-socialist-rage Mike Moore.  It is a very funny movie without the heavily biased, bigoted partisan politics of his later stuff.  Just pokes fun at government and Canadians mainly.  Elements of his later leftist leaning in the amoral arms dealing industrialist and CIA buffoon but otherwise very digestible stuff for any political persuasion.

Didn't watch Cadillac man.",1398297600,,399,5.475409836065574
5451406,4,B00AMQGDYY,"I had Canadian Bacon on my Netflix list forever and they just don't have it...so, even though I usually don't buy movies I had to have this oldie but goodie.  Bonus was getting a second DVD in the Cadillac Man...both old, both good and funny.",1397088000,3,242,4.377777777777778
5451407,2,B00AMQGDYY,"It was not particularly good - pretty corny.  However, if you're 'into' Canadiana. it's appealing.  The main actors do not live up to their very positive reputations.",1394323200,,166,5.111111111111111
5451408,5,B00AMQGDYY,Canadian Bacon is truly a classic John Candy flick.. It's especially cool as we are kinda close to the border and the falls so we can relate to it.,1384819200,,147,4.103448275862069
5451409,4,B00AMQGDYY,"Good value double-feature movie set. 'Canadian Bacon' was the better of the two, in my opinion (but then I've always enjoyed John Candy movies). That being said, 'Cadillac Man' was a nice insight into Robin Williams' earlier efforts in his career. Both title-role actors truly went before their time.",1453852800,2,300,5.142857142857143

5451417,5,B00AMQGDYY,You have to remember This was written by Michael Moore and Its Although a comedy it is also an expression of his views on the way the government works to benifit themselves. I love this movie And I miss JC greatly. Its difintely worth 11 bucks,1418169600,,243,4.304347826086956

8553922,5,B00AMQGDYY,"There is nothing funnier than Canadian Bacon!  I love John Candy, but the entire cast is great!! It's especially fun since the filming was done right around where we live. The best part is most of the actors making fun of Canada are actually CANADIAN!!!",1519689600,,253,4.622222222222222
