8386904,1,B0031DRVRS,"I am done watching movies from this director- because he is NOT good. He also did Spring Break Massacre which was a total flop too. I thought I was going to like this movie because of all the previous reviews I read that kept stating it had good suspense in it.  Where?? Nothing in this movie is suspenseful and again just a lot of people sitting around talking with hardly any action happening. The best part is the beginning of the movie and the rest falls flat on it's face. Again, this could have been a fun movie but it wasn't...at all. There are MUCH better B horror movies out there.",1273622400,,590,4.315315315315315
8386905,1,B0031DRVRS,"As with others of its ilk, the lack of character development is what makes ROT sputter. Some of them are adequately introduced, but they all boast muddy motivations and have a difficult time rising above stereotype. Perhaps it's because director Michael A. Hoffman is mostly concerned with thinking of ways to thematically leap between slasher conventions, all to no avail. The tonal shifts, for instance, accomplish nothing but unevenness; at first, ROT is a mystery, then it switches to campy comedy, then to romantic drama, before throwing a bit  of blood in the viewer's face!

An unknown cast supplies the lion's share of performances, and they are all negligible. Only John Shumski (American Gladiators), as the drooling hillbilly ranger with a nasty tongue, escapes mediocrity. As with the situation, I simply couldn't buy into any of these performers, particularly when they rarely exhibit any kind of depth or dimension. The obvious dialogue certainly doesn't help either; it's impossible to accept any of these characters as college students, let alone high-school graduates. The bottom line is you could care less if any of these people lives or dies; the kiss of death for all slasher movies.

You have NO hints to the killers motives until the end, so it's a cheat as a mystery, and while the motive may apply to SOME of the cast, it still does not explain why the prolouge killings occured.

You're better off spending your money and time on other things.

8386906,3,B0031DRVRS,"to tell you the truth this slasher wasn't all that good like some of the critics say, very low budget movie, the kill scenes suck, the story wasn't bad, suspenseful, and does have a shocking ending. I was hoping more of kind of like the 80's type slasher movies you may disagree but the kind of slashers i like are no offscreen kills, i like more onscreen kills, and what was up with the beginning it was like watching a porn which made no sense. I don't think i would recommend this to slasher fans but if you want suspense you may want this.",1269129600,4,543,4.230769230769231
8386907,1,B0031DRVRS,"This movie is soft core porn, not a horror movie. It's plot (and I use the term very loosely) is centered around numerous soft core porn scenes with some random violence, ridiculous dialog, and terrible editing - not to mention the characters seem to drive on the wrong side of the road throughout the entire thing (just one example of just how bad this one is). Save your money and keep looking, unless this is what you're looking for! If you're a horror fan, even B-horror, this one will leave you wishing you could get your money back. You've been warned!",1269129600,5,558,4.534653465346534
