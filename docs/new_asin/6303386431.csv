In fact, the INSTRUCTOR of the class walked out as well. The relief felt when he/she finally commits suicide was not worth the utter hell of watching the protagonist's torment for two hours.  The remaining students actually cheered when death finally ended not only his suffering but our own.
Call me insensitive and closed-minded, but only after you have experienced this ordeal for yourself.  This is the worst film this film instructor has ever seen.",1029196800,8,581,5.08421052631579
8208654,3,6303386431,"My first response to '13 Moons' is that it is not a great Fassbinder film.  I'll admit, though, that maybe it's just too tragic to be ""enjoyable"" in the normal sense.
Volker Spengler is an excellent actor, and the chance to play a character like Elvira must have been fascinating for him.  Ingrid Caven is as seductive as ever, although not quite as intriguing in this film as she is in `Merchant of Four Seasons' or `Mother Kusters.'  The biggest treat is Gottfried John as Anton Saitz -- a real hoot of a character.  It's a shame that not all corporate hot-shots can be as outrageous and fun as Saitz.  We see him and his hirelings playing what is apparently a daily game of a shoot-out (with blanks, of course) in the company parking lot.  You also get the sense that Saitz wears those white tennis shorts to work every day.  Saitz is the real high point of the film.
But '13 Moons' is ultimately a tragedy, and a deeply affecting portrait of a transvestite's humanity.  You'll be shocked by the horrid slaughterhouse scenes; and also by the irony that a sensitive character like Elvira could work in such a bloody place.  A metaphor of a feeling soul in a sublimely horrible world?  Worth a look, but still not one of Fassbinder's greatest.",1017100800,2,1244,4.538116591928251
