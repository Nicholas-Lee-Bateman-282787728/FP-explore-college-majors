8356202,1,B000M5ALES,This video had 2 men talking about the Garden of Eden and this was the same thing for four times.  I did not return the DVD as I would have only received half of what I paid for it.  Was really a flop and was really disappointed as I have always enjoyed buying from Amazon.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  Just a waste of your money.  I thought it would be like the book.  I have seen DVD's that was like the book.,1285891200,2,418,3.9166666666666665
