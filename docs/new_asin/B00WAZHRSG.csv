8712787,4,B00WAZHRSG,"I really enjoyed this movie. The characters are great and the actors brought them to life. It's not often that I'm frightened of a fictional character but Billy C did a fantastic job portraying his evil manipulator. Don't think many down in the dumps people would stand a chance against him. The rest of the cast did a fine job with their roles, as well. Sometimes their lives are lived on the edge of mainstream but they can carry on if someone cares about each of them. I can only hope that Corey's character stands a chance in the end. He deserves it.",1532304000,,554,4.388349514563107
8712788,3,B00WAZHRSG,This movie is mildly amusing but far fetched. Anyone who is being framed for a murder they didn't commit who has even a ounce of common sense would have made a beeline for the police. Also the lead didn't have the physical presence of an ex-fighter needed to sell the character.,1480464000,,278,4.470588235294118

8712790,2,B00WAZHRSG,"Producers trying to save money at viewer's expense. No subtitles for normal or hard of hearing or hearing loss audiences. Combined with poor audio level control and inconsistent enunciation making dialogue take a back seat to cost cutting. Nothing creative in story in that we have, still another boxer/fighter down on his luck recruited to collect money for a not-so-nice mobster. Backstory of the usual family issues. Acting was acceptable given there isn't much to the story - just go around and knock on a few doors and say ""pay up or else"". Duh, how creative. Ending - predictable.",1445212800,,586,4.929292929292929
8712791,4,B00WAZHRSG,Superb acting!!! Where is the recognition for this fabulous set of actors??? Good story line. Stylish yet dark camera work - liked it - very different. Story line was predicable but that truly did not matter. Watch this movie!,1441670400,,226,4.82051282051282
8712792,5,B00WAZHRSG,"Over the last several months, my husband and I have been renting movie after movie, and feeling ""bleh"" about all of them. Not this one. We got drawn into the story immediately. The psychopathy displayed by Mr. Crudup is utterly spell binding. It shows you just how fast one can get pulled under the current. Great flick!",1440892800,,320,4.631578947368421
8712793,5,B00WAZHRSG,Glass Chin is a nuanced work of art. Corey Stoll brilliantly understates his heroic role. If you're sick and tired of the same old Hollywood same old watch this film. A gem.,1436227200,2,173,4.4375
8712794,3,B00WAZHRSG,"The story centers on retired boxer Bud ""The Saint"" Gordon (Corey Stoll). He is working as a trainer for up and coming Kid Sunshine. He retired because of his glass chin and lives with a wife he hasn't married. Bud rides around with a man (Billy Crudup) who does collections as part of a second job, one where they like to own their employees.  Bud lives a life filled with regret and a desire for a ""do over.""

The film is a slow developing drama and more of a chracter study. The action is done off screen, including the boxing. This is NOT a boxing film, but one where boxing is a background. Less exciting than ""Foxcatcher.""

8712795,3,B00WAZHRSG,"When life delivers the punches, it's best you not have a glass chin. The story of the down 'n out pugilist is a familiar one that Hollywood loves to revisit as frequently as possible. When it comes to sports as life microcosm there's nothing better than the mano-a-mano slugfest between practitioners of the sweet science battling for a slice of redemption. A similar story plays out in Noah Buschel's measured, gritty, and somewhat muted Glass Chin, a film that excels in noir atmosphere and wonderfully-composed performances by the cast.

The ever reliable Corey Stoll plays ex-boxer Bud Gordon, a Manhattan brawler who had it all once upon a time. Bud's weakness wasn't his talent in the squared circle, but his vices outside of it; his ""glass chin"" so to speak. No longer living high in Manhattan, he's stuck in a cramped New Jersey apartment with his Buddhist girlfriend Ellen (Marin Ireland) arguing about things they never had to worry about before. While she's ready to find a job and move forward, Bud still believes a comeback is around the corner. He doesn't necessarily want a return to the squared circle, but maybe something to offset the costly failure of his restaurant venture. For living old glories, Bud trains an up and coming young boxer at a rundown gym in the city. If he'll never fight again, at least Bud can help turn this kid into a champion, and maybe steer him clear of the pitfalls that felled his own career.

But life has a funny way of delivering a perfectly timed body blow, and when Bud is at his most vulnerable that's when quirky, menacing gangster J.J. (Billy Crudup) slithers into his life. Charismatic and charming, if oddly obsessed with social networking and his number of Twitter followers, J.J. makes Bud an offer he can't refuse. Come back to work for him in some undefined manner and he'll help revive Bud's old restaurant, and maybe even move the gym to Manhattan where it can thrive. Of course it's a bad idea; like blindly signing a contract with Don King, but Bud is out of options if he ever wants to be the man he used to be again.

And it's in exploring Bud's fractured sense of self-worth that Glass Chin is best. How far will one go to reclaim the past? How much does one's personal integrity cost? It's these internal concerns that anchor the film as a broader criminal plot emerges, one that sees Bud set-up for a crime he didn't commit. Buschel casts a dreary, menacing atmosphere, showing the same gifted hand seen in his underrated mystery, The Missing Person. Although in this case his supporting characters are considerably more bizarre, like they just hitched a ride in from Sin City. Crudup's exaggerated performance as J.J. is a highlight, but the real scene-stealer is Yul Vazquez (Seinfeld fans will recognize him instantly) as the murderous chatterbox, Roberto. Even stranger are meaningless, drug-fueled scenes with Inherent Vice breakout, Katherine Waterston as a ring girl named Petals. And then there's Stoll, holding everything together with another strong performance as the tragic, well-meaning hero.

Atmosphere and acting are never a problem, but slow pacing is definitely worth a point deduction on the scorecard. Even at 87 minutes Bud's story moves along too gradually, and those hoping to see at least some boxing scenes will come away disappointed. Domestic squabbles between Bud and Ellen about life philosophies and their uncertain future don't quite have the punch of later conversations between the men, who are all dealing with some degree of identity crisis. Oftentimes resembling a poor man's David Mamet, Glass Chin is a sturdy drama delivering some heavy emotional blows, even if it doesn't score a knockout.",1435968000,4,3699,4.9136
