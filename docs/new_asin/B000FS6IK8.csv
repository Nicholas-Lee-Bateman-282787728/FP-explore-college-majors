8505337,1,B000FS6IK8,"What a disappointment!  Everything the first reviewer said is unfortunately correct.  This video is poorly produced, concepts are not clearly explained, and many of the examples are unattractive.

Much of the video is shot using a green screen, which is immediately noticeable and looks really bad.  In fact, it looks as if Victor Milt tried to shoot and produce this video in a day or two.  In many scenes, he didn't even take the time to put his lav. mike on properly.  Some of the shooting isn't much better.

As for the examples he showed, a few looked nice, but most did not.  Even though the author shows how to use a home made softbox, why would you want to build it when the results don't look professional?

I've watched a lot of lighting videos - at least nine or ten.  This is the most disappointing of the bunch and massively overpriced.  I'd recommend titles by Bill Holshevnikoff, Doug Jensen, DVInfo. Net, or Dean Collins instead.  They are not only better teachers, but they lit, shot, and produced their videos right.",1289692800,3,1034,4.651933701657459
8505338,1,B000FS6IK8,"I was shocked at just how bad this DVD was.  The production values are sloppy and the examples given are poor.  In fact, and this is not hyperbole, I honestly believe that some of the ""good"" examples given are incomplete, poorly explained or just flat out better examples of what NOT to do.  I highly recommend passing on this one.",1251849600,,331,4.483333333333333
