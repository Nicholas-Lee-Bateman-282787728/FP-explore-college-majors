3520230,5,B001CUAZG6,One of the best documentaries out there. I had this recorded from the actual TV show (commercials included) so was real happy to get this in the DVD format.  It arrived in record time and in great shape.,1407456000,,203,4.342105263157895
3520231,5,B001CUAZG6,"This is a great documentary on Al Capone and Chicago in the 1920s. The primary focus of this documentary is The St. Valentines Day Massacre, but it also cronicles all of the major players in this City at the time, from politicians to the various gangsters and the climate that they operated in. Very intertaining and informative, especially if you are interested in Capone or Chicago in that time period.",1394064000,,404,4.785714285714286
3520232,5,B001CUAZG6,"As an earlier reviewer did, I too taped this off television many years ago and is one of the few I VHS tapes I've held on to. Grainy and fuzzy though it  was, I continued to watch it quite often and refused to let go of it through several moves from place to place. Learning it was available on DVD I immediately ordered a copy.
I doubt there is any way this documentary could have been produced any better in scope and depth. I especially enjoyed the narration. Unlike today's documentaries, this one presents no reenactments, something I particularly dislike. It uses image stills and newsreel footage in ways real documentaries should be shown. I learned tons from this film.
I strongly recommend this DVD if you're even remotely fascinated in this subject. You won't be disappointed.
Great job guys.",1392854400,8,803,4.735714285714286

3520234,5,B001CUAZG6,"One of the History Channel's better documentaries.  Paul Sorvino's narrative is well done and the archival footage is very interesting, much of it newly broadcast at the time the documentary was produced.  A good history of organized crime in Chicago from 1919 to 1931 with Capone being its focal point.",1375833600,8,303,5.04
