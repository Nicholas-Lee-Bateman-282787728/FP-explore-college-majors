I assume that I was like many of you who see this review: all I knew of ""Ten Minutes"" was that it was the film that Nick Miller is watching on TV in another David Giancola movie, ""Time Chasers"" (a.k.a. ""Tangents"") when he sees the commercial that sends him down a fateful path of love, death, and Commodore 64-powered time travel. And, like many of you, I saw ""Time Chasers"" when it featured as an episode on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  Like many of you, I looked up ""Ten Minutes"" not knowing if it was real or just something the director mocked up for that scene in ""Time Chasers.""  I like short films and oddities, so I ordered this DVD not long ago after I had re-watched ""Time Chasers.""

Here's what you need to know about ""Ten Minutes"" if you're considering buying a copy:
For its time, and for the budget and technology available (video), ""Ten Minutes"" is good. It's not bad.  It's not as intentionally or unintentionally funny as ""Time Chasers.""  I'd suggest you approach it as you would a student film made out of love for filmmaking and for the original material that ""Ten Minutes"" is based on. The actors aren't Hollywood names, but they're clearly into what they're doing. Watched today, in an age of big-budget schlock that's intentionally bad (""Sharknado,"" anyone?) or just brutally horrible (see also ""The Room""), ""Ten Minutes"" pays homage to its source material and shows technical proficiency.  As someone who's shot and edited video on a small scale for YouTube, yes, you can make a movie today with a DSLR and a copy of Premiere - but making that movie tell a story takes thought and skill. You can see the start of that in what Giancola has done here.

About the product itself:
The DVD I ordered arrived in a professional plastic case with a nice, full-color label, as shown in the image I'm uploading.  Edgewood Studios was kind enough to throw in a bonus DVD (not pictured) of another Giancola movie, ""Illegal Aliens,"" which I've yet to watch - but it's nice to get that unexpected treat.

I loved laughing at ""Time Chasers"" on MST3k.  You won't get the same laugh value out of ""Ten Minutes,"" so if you're buying it for riff value, you might want to save your money. But I'm not disappointed in my purchase, as someone who likes independent films and appreciates the effort that goes into doing anything creative.  And while I didn't have any knowledge of The Spirit as a character going into this purchase, I can see how fans of that character could enjoy this film.",1490227200,,2509,4.603139013452915
8654314,3,B00JWXRZ5E,"Not exactly what I expected.. I was surprised that Will was a producer when it seemed like a kind of ""throw together"" project... It was on a burned cdr with a paper label and the outer case artwork (although it was Will's) didn't seem wonderfully produced.  The movie was alright, kind of like a student film.. not bad - inserts of Spirit pages kept popping up with the acting, which was mediocre at best.
Like I said, not too bad.. you get what you pay for and I'm a completest freak so I couldn't pass it up, but I own some bootlegs of different movies and concerts with much better packaging, some practically up to professional studio standards - like you'd buy at a store and not give a second look - be warned this isn't made to such standards.
Since this was an ""official"" release (an award winning short at that) even though I'd never heard of the production company, I expected more..

Still gave it 3 stars for Will's art (that was worthwhile, if you're into his actual art more than movies/tv that's a good chapter of the disc!)",1451952000,,1039,4.43455497382199
