1901265,5,B0000A2ZU3,"The word ""levity"" is supposed to mean ""lightness"", but there is certainly nothing light about this stark drama which deals with sin and redemption.  Billy Bob Thornton is cast as a troubled man who has just been released from prison for killing a convenience store clerk in a botched robbery 23 years before.  He plays the role with quiet stoicism, wears his graying hair shoulder length and speaks in a gentle voice as he returns to the neighborhood where the crime was committed.
Here, he meets Morgan Freeman, a storefront preacher with a secret of his own, and he's given a job as custodian of the place.  Kristin Durst is one of the lost young people who he comes in contact with, and in his own simple way, he seems to be making a difference in her life.  The person he has come here to meet, however, is the sister of the young man who he had murdered. Holly Hunter is cast in this role and they start to develop a deep friendship, especially when her son gets in trouble and Billy Bob Thornton comes to his aid.
There's a sadness and melancholy to the entire film, which is set on cold dreary  winter streets.  It's slow, bleak and rather creepy, especially when the hero is visited over and over again by the apparition of the young man who he has murdered.  I found the concept interesting, the acting excellent and the story sad and depressing.  And yet, it was a fine film.",1062806400,13,1385,4.446640316205533
1901266,4,B0000A2ZU3,"New on DVD (August, 03), this overlooked, exceptional film strikes an emotional chord with universal truths.

Based on real events, LEVITY (Columbia Tristar) stars Billy Bob Thornton as a convicted murderer paroled after serving 19 years in prison. Haunted by his spontaneous shooting of a store clerk in a failed robbery, he craves reconciliation and returns to his old inner-city neighborhood where he encounters a troubled woman (Kirsten Dunst), a mysterious street preacher (Morgan freeman) and the sister (Holly Hunter) of the boy he killed.
It's rare that a movie tackles such difficult themes of guilt, forgiveness, reconciliation and atonement with such insight, grace and intelligence.",1062374400,13,694,5.547169811320755
1901267,5,B0000A2ZU3,"If there is a common theme running through Billy Bob Thornton's dramatic roles, it would have to be a man's search for redemption. It can be found in SLING BLADE, A SIMPLE PLAN, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, MONSTER'S BALL, THE BADGE, and again in LEVITY, the film directorial debut of screenwriter Ed Solomon. Unlike more 'commercial' actors, who would prefer playing innocent victims framed for crimes (or would be 'heroic' in committing 'justifiable' deeds), Thornton's characters are guilty of their trespasses, and accept their punishment as deserved. This gives his performances a sense of reality that is always interesting to watch.
In LEVITY, Thornton is Manual Jordan, a 'lifer' who has spent over twenty years in prison for shooting and killing a kid during a convenience store robbery, as a youth. The act was not a crime of passion, it was simply an involuntary reaction to a quizzical 'look' the kid gave him, an expression that would bond the two of them for years to come.
When a parole board decides to commute Jordan's sentence (""Why?"" he asks, stunned by the decision after saying he was content to remain in prison), the middle-aged man finds himself alone in an alien, indifferent world, with only the kid's 'ghost' as company.
Jordan decides to try and help the victim's sister, Adele (the ageless Holly Hunter), without revealing his identity (""If you're trying to 'hit' on me,"" she quips, ""I have to warn you, over the years, my standards have lowered...""). She has her hands full with a wild teenaged son, and can't quite figure out this taciturn, long-haired vagrant!
Answering a ringing pay phone, Jordan finds his way to a jaded lay minister (Morgan Freeman, excellent, as always), who, recognizing him as an ex-con, provides him with a place to stay, and a job, cleaning and directing teens from a dance club into the broken-down mission he runs, next door. When Jordan tells the old preacher that he doesn't believe in God, the old man snaps, ""I'm not asking you to! I'm asking you to work!"" One of the rowdy 'club' teens (Kirsten Dunst), the daughter of a 'one-hit wonder' singer on the skids, finds herself drawn to Jordan, despite his obvious disapproval of her lifestyle.
As with all the best 'indies', there is a richness of character in LEVITY, with each actor in top form. Subtly building to a surprising revelation and an emotional climax, the film may not appeal to audiences who prefer pyrotechnics to plot, but if you like movies with believable characters, and an involving story that unfolds at it's own pace, you'll find it to be a very rewarding experience!",1061596800,14,2598,4.853603603603603

1901274,4,B0000A2ZU3,"This film proves what that an excellent case can push a overly-sentimental script over the top.  Billy Bob Thorton plays Manual Solomon so well it is scary.  Holly Hunter, Morgan Freem, Kirsten Dunst, and even the young man who plays the ghost of Billy Bob's victim are spectacular.  Unfortunately the story does not describe life on our planet.  Two beautiful women, one half Billy Bob's age, fall for him because he is the strong, silent type I guess.  In the real world women like Holly Hunter and Kirsten Dunst would not give an old, worn out ex-con who doesn't talk much the time of day.  Then Billy Bob just happens to stumble into this situation with Morgan Freemen.  The fact that it is utterly contrived doesn't matter because it gives Mr. Freeman the opportunity to stretch out his substantial acting chops.  But all in all the script is contrived and maudlin.  Another male fantasy from Hollywood that women fall for losers, murderers and outsiders.  They don't.  They ignore them.  Perhaps that would have made for a better movie.",1336953600,,1042,4.792134831460674

1901276,2,B0000A2ZU3,"Take a few classic characters, shake them up in a Yahtzee, cup, roll them out, and you have this film. Let's see... there's the ex-con trying to find his way, the rough-and-ready preacher reaching out to kids with no direction, the poor little rich girl, the tough single mom and her no-account son.  The settings are just as bad - the club in the 'hood frequented by rich kids from the burbs, the poor kids lose their basketball court to big bad construction men, the ex-con is forced to become a role model, little rich girl walks into the bunch of neighborhood kids, supposedly giving back as good as she gets (but none of them fall for her or try anything?), and don't forget tragically single mom falling right into bed with Mr. Ex-con after he seemingly turns her son around. Have to admit, I was surprised by two things - Mr. Ex-con did not bed rich white girl (she sure seemed willing), and preacher man was not quite what he seemed.

The thing to do is write a movie about Preacher Man/Man on the run, have the timeline overlap with this film -  now THAT might get somewhere...",1294012800,,1086,4.447236180904523
1901277,4,B0000A2ZU3,"How does one make things right? Seek forgiveness? Where does redemption reside and how do you get there? How does a wounded soul reconcile guilt?
This is a slow and thoughtful character study set during a grim and dreary winter in an urban town.
This is not a Hollywood movie. It's raw with real life. It's apparent ugliness is its sheer inescapable  beauty.
Morality does exist no matter how we try to hide.
Thornton, after spending over 20 years in prison for the murder of a young convenience store clerk during a robbery gone haywire in his youth, is drawn to return to his old neighborhood to visit the older sister of the young man he killed, played by Holly Hunter. She doesn't quite know who he really is since so many years have gone by.
Thornton was content to live out his remaining years behind bars but must now face his past because his sentence was suddenly commuted.
Bleak with melancholy, this type of film gets shunned by audiences and it's a shame.
Morgan Freeman plays a mysterious soup kitchen minister who has his own issues, whom Thornton comes to work for. Freeman is a natural actor and believable in any role.
The story unfolds slowly without gimmicks.
At times, Thornton happens to find himself  visited by the ghostly apparition of the young man whom  he killed,  while he is in the process of seeking resolution and atonement.
His simple desire is to somehow make amends. He wants to be forgiven but, strangely, he is unable and unwilling to forgive himself.
Unfortunately, unresolved redemption seems to be too deep a theme for contemporary audiences who are hooked on chills and thrills and pyrotechnics.
This is an independent film, the kind that many people just don't get.
A movie for your quiet time or a rainy night. Something different and refreshing.
And no silly happy ending to mar the procedings.",1281571200,,1837,4.73125
1901278,5,B0000A2ZU3,"This movie pulls you into the story and holds you there.  You may even start talking to the characters.  I hate movies that are predictable (I can usually predict what is going to happen next in a Hollywood movie), but this one was SO REFRESHING, because I was constantly surprised by each upcoming scene and dialog!!!
It is a movie about an adult trying to make amends and trying to receive forgiveness after killing someone while young and immature.  It stirs up plenty of emotion, and had me weeping a few times.
The area where the movie shows weakness in the script is where some of the characters said they didn't believe in God.  If that's really how they believed, then why seek forgiveness from a stranger?  Why show any compassion or remorse at all?  In fact, you might as well kill whoever you like IF there's no final judgment and IF God isn't watching!  The problem is that the characters actions didn't always line up with that belief system.  (And of course, there is going to be a judgment, just read the Bible for yourself if you have any doubts.  The apostle Paul, who was once anti-Christian, later spoke with the risen Jesus, and willingly died for his faith in Jesus.  Paul said we will ALL be judged by Jesus, and that EVERY knee shall bow to Jesus.)
Nevertheless, I give this movie a strong 5-stars.  I plan to keep this in my movie library and watch it over and over.  The people are likeable, the plot is good, the acting is believable, and the whole movie is refreshingly different and thought provoking.",1227571200,2,1529,4.54014598540146

1901280,4,B0000A2ZU3,"LEVITY is the first movie written and directed by Ed Salomon. In spite of the presence of Billy Bob Thornton, Kirsten Dunst, Morgan Freeman and Holly Hunter, the film didn't do well when it was theatrically released so let's just hope that the DVD market will give it a second chance. Because LEVITY simply deserves a second chance.

LEVITY is a fable with these characters who seem to be all protected by a visible or, for some of them, an invisible presence. So, Billy Bob Thornton, with the help of Morgan Freeman, will be able to find peace in his mind and Kirsten Dunst, Holly Hunter and her son will be able to make peace with their past thanks to Thornton. The buckle is closed and, as in a fable, LEVITY delivers a strong moral message. It could have been a Disney movie but it's not because Ed Salomon's characters are multidimensional and the director scatters light symbolic notes throughout his movie, just think about how Billy Bob Thornton has to deal with his incapability to understand the numerous jokes people say to him or his inability to simply smile.

When I picked this up at a clearance sale at my local video shop, I had no clue what I was getting into, especially when at the time I was still skeptical of Billy Bob Thornton. I will admit that I did enjoy his work in ""Monster's Ball"", but I still needed more convincing. ""Levity"" confirmed that he is indeed a talented actor worthy of my respect. His work in this film was nothing less than outstanding, and this role seemed to be tailored just for him.

A pity the average movie goer has the depth of a damp tissue, this movie is worth seeing. A tale of unrequited redemption, well played, well written. Yes, the focus is Manual, as it ought to be. I loved Morgan Freeman, but I've adored him since I saw him on PBS in ""Electric Company"" some 25-30 years ago.

This movie should make you think. No happy ending, things don't tie up just because they ought to. It's dark, but what isn't these days?

The acting is excellent and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. I particularly loved Kirsten Dunst as the drugged out club kid. I also loved Holly Hunter as the older sister of the boy that was murdered by Billy Bob Thornton.

1901285,4,B0000A2ZU3,"LEVITY is one of those quiet films that gains its strength from the characterizations and their interactions.  Writer/director Ed Simpson gives us a story of an ex-con named Manual Jordan, who is released after spending 21 years in prison for the robbery murder of a 17 year old convenience store clerk.  He narrates his story and tells us the five steps of redemption culled from an eleventh century novel.  He seeks his own redemption by confronting his victim's sister, who now has her own son, named after her murdered brother.  Fate brings him to a community house run by a preacher who hires him for odd jobs and gets him involved with the youth.  This includes a self-destructive rich girl whom he befriends, sort of.  A patient and discerning viewer will appreciate the richness of the performances and the marvelous cinematography by Roger Deakins.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Manual with an understated tragic demeanor and does well; Holly Hunter plays the sister, also underplaying the role but mesmerizing in it; Morgan Freeman is the preacher and he is at his best as this unselfish, yet mystic, gentleman, and Kirsten Dunst is splendid as the rich girl who finds a source of salvation in Thornton.  Though one can almost predict the ultimate outcome, the writer is smart enough not to give us a neat, tidy ending.  The movie is leisurely paced but the performances keep you involved.",1136073600,5,1395,4.877118644067797
1901286,3,B0000A2ZU3,"It felt like I had been driving in a car for hours.  No rest stops, but there's no pressure because I don't have to go the bathroom.  It never quite seemed we would reach our destination and so I screamed, but no one was around to hear it.  That's what LEVITY felt like.

More writer-than-director Ed Solomon's entry into the sweetly populated area of 100 minute films having to do with crime and its reprecussions is nothing more than a walkway into one character -though it's formatted like a small ensemble piece.  Sure, we get to spend time with the other characters but their fates are anti-climactic and by the middle of the film, we could care less about them because they're poorly developed.  Morgan Freeman, for instance...

Morgan Freeman's preacher character is the most enjoyable thing outside of the juvenile hellraisers he's responsible for.  He plays a preacher that makes clubgoers sit through a 15 minute sermon in exchange for parking their cars in his garage in a gritty urban neighborhood, i.e. bad.  Freeman shines in this role, straying from his usual idealistic undertones his past characters have taken.  He's gruff, fast, and tough.  And his humour is directly on point everytime.  Yet, his storyline fizzles out too quickly and we never reach the conclusion we want with him because Ed Solomon's more concerned about other things at present.

Holly Hunter (one of the most amazing actresses our time) is completely wasted as the sister of the man Thornton shot.  She's wallpaper, and her resolution with Thornton is creative, but again, feels like a false-start that we're watching just die, writing wise.  She's too easy and Holly is never that easy in her films.  No depth.

Billy Bob is great in the role, but what else is new.  His expertise at playing standoffish yet accessible men is always refreshing but it seems Solomon couldn't make up his mind about whether the character was the victim of optimism or pessimism.  His storyline is the only one treated to a fair shake and his chemistry with every one else is well crafted, though it seems he never reaches the inner pinnacle of his performance as he's done in other films.  He's very one note, then he's not.  He's very sorry, then he's not so very sorry, but still weepy.  Fans of Thornton will want to rip their hair out over this performance, I'm sure.  Though like I said, we reach a justified end with him.

Roger Deakins' cinematography can't be beat and stands as the second great benchmark of this film (1 of 2).  With Deakins you can't go south.  He'll always seem to make your film glow, even when it doesn't earn it.  He's the patron saint of beautiful images.  Solomon must've begged him.

All in all, LEVITY makes you want to watch it.  Are you happier or better afterwards?  I don't know, I'm still thinking about it 12 hours later but I'm thinking about why I'm thinking so hard about it.  Freeman is the reason to watch this film.  Period.",1122595200,5,2944,4.698630136986301

Genre Grade: B

Final Grade: A-

This was a suprisingly excellent film from the screenwriter of Men in Black and Charlie's Angels. I have been holding off on watching this movie for a long time simply because Billy Bob Thornton's long hair on the cover box kind of turned me off from the movie. After watching it (and finding out his long hair is due to 21 years in prison, probably not too many haircuts during that time) I was suprised how much I enjoyed it. The acting from Morgan Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, Holly Hunter, and even Kirsten Dunst was great, and this strong story about redemption will leave you pondering how you might react in such a situation.

This movie didn't get a lot of good reviews (I don't know why), but I still enjoyed it and I think most audiences might too. It is a tad slow but the story is strong and there is some good humor in it to keep it moving. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed 21 Grams, American History X (although this movie could have been a LOT more controversial) or if you just enjoy the actors in the film.",1116979200,6,1080,4.3316831683168315

1901289,4,B0000A2ZU3,"Manual Jordan (Billy Bob Thornton) has been sitting in a prison cell for 23 years, where the only decoration is a newspaper photograph of the teenager he killed in a convenience store robbery.  In voice over he tells us about a book written in the 11th century that argues there are five steps necessary to make amends: acknowledge what you did, feel remorse, make right what you did wrong, then make it right with God, and then you can be redeemed.  But Jordan knows he cannot bring back Abner Easley and does not believe ""in some God that's gonna open His arms to me even if I did.""  That takes care of steps three and four, and since we can never be in the same place twice, Jordan knows he will never be redeemed.  So he has accepted his place in prison and is surprised when his sentence is commuted to time served and he is thrown back in the world.  Even though he knows it is hopeless, Jordan wants to atone for his horrible crime.

""Levity"" is about a man who wants to be forgiven although he will never be able to forgive himself.  We want to feel compassion for Jordan, but we know that he is probably right and that he is never going to be able to attain redemption.  But writer-director Ed Solomon, who has his own cross to bear as the co-writer of ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" does not really return Jordan to the real world.  Instead the ex-con finds himself in strange almost dreamlike world where answering a pay phone in the middle of the night gets you a job and a place to stay at a mission that operates across the street from a nightclub.  The place is run by Miles Evans (Morgan Freeman), an eccentric preacher, who allows kids to park for free at his lot if they come in and sit for 15 minutes while he preaches at them.  Jordan's job is to stand out in the cold and get the kids to sign in with their names and time of arrival.

Of all the faceless kids who wander through each night one stands out, young Sofia Mellinger (Kirsten Dunst).  She seems like a drug loving party girl, but Jordan sees somebody who is trying pretty hard to kill herself.  However, Sofia is not his primary concern.  That would be trying to get Adele Easley (Holly Hunter) to let him help her take her bags home.  She, of course, is the sister of the boy he killed, who knows has a son named Abner who is essentially the same age as his namesake was 23 years earlier.  Jordan is persistent enough without being too pushy, and his formal way of speaking and strange manner catches Adele's interest, although she is quick to point out that her standards have slipped over the years.  However, Jordan is not looking for romance and that is only way of the things that he cannot tell Adele.

Evans has a pretty good idea of what Jordan is up to, especially after Adele calls the mission looking for somebody whose name she does not know.  While the preacher agrees with Jordan that redemption is impossible, he also supports the idea that trying is not the worst of all possible fates.  Besides, if he cannot save himself there is the possibility that Jordan might be able to save young Abner or Sofia.  Beyond that there is the question of what will happen when Adele finds out Jordan's true identity, because you know that moment is going to come at a pivotal point in the story.

The performances in ""Levity"" are the most compelling part of the film, which is hardly surprising given you have Thornton, Freeman and Hunter in the three key roles.  Dunst is a bit outclassed but then her character is not written at the same level; her strong point is the way she can hold her own in verbal sparing with the juvenile delinquents who are sent to the mission to hear first Evans and then Jordan talk to them.  Mostly this movie is a series of scenes between Jordan and the other three characters, as well as with young Abner (Geoffrey Wigdor).  Thornton, who is always looking or different ways to play every one of his characters, is going for a level of subtlety here that is a shade short of complete inertia.  Yet, for the most part, it works.

Most certainly there will be those who will find ""Levity"" to be too preachy and that the ending might be too contrived.  But this is a film that has an appropriately subdued notion of what should constitute a happy ending under these tragic circumstances.  Ultimately, its biggest problem could well be that the point is made early on in the film.  Jordan has accepted his fate as being well deserved and despite the fact that he cannot change anything or find peace, he tries to do something anyway.  By that standard how well he succeeds does not matter because that would not be the point of the lesson.  If you understand that, then you may well find most of this 2003 drama to be superfluous.",1095984000,3,4749,4.415614236509759
1901290,5,B0000A2ZU3,"I wish I could fill my library with movies exactly like this. When I first saw this movie, I sort of watched it in shock. Stories of this quality are so rare! First and foremost, this is about forgiveness. Each character in our story feels that they have failed in some way, and they're not sure how to simply make it right. To make peace. Large mistakes, little mistakes, these little devils tend to stay with us, sowing the seeds is discontent.
  Manual Jordan (Billy Bob Thorton) is released from jail after 20 years and embarks on a mission to find redemption, although he doesn't really expect to find it. Perhaps it is the journey that is more important to him. He finds a preacher (Morgan Freeman) who is trying to reach a bunch of teenagers and steer them away from the destructive lifestyles they're leading. He runs a makeshift church/soup kitchen across the street from a local dance club.
  Manual also comes in to the life of a woman (Holly Hunter) who is trying to steer her son away from the gang street life he is falling in to. By far my favorite piece of this story is played by the beautiful Kirsten Dunst. She is the emotional heart of the story as the confused party girl who dreams of a better life, but has no idea how to get there. Suffering from low self-esteem and an angry alcoholic mother, she drifts closer to harms way each night.
  What is story has to offer is emotions in raw form. What would any of us do in extreme circumstances? Most of us will never know. These people do. Most of their lives have been impacted by one form of violence or another. These are decent people inside. People that made bad choices. The road to hell is paved with good intentions they say and little tiny mistakes. Pretty soon these little mistakes feed on themselves and before you know it, you start having BIG lapses in good judgment. How did this happen? How did I get here? ---by many little mistakes.
  What was most important to me in this story was the insight in to the fragility and strength of the human spirit. These people are not perfect. But each of them is hoping for something better, something more meaningful. A purpose, and maybe a little emotional justice. You can think of them all as wounded animals, trapped in a box. Most of them don't know how they got in there. They want out. They don't know how to get out, and they're growing increasingly desperate. It is in this dark place that they find their true characters. By looking their little devils in the face and choosing another path, they begin to find peace within themselves.

I know that this is not always a pretty picture. But sometimes you need to look at the ugliness of humanity in order to see the beauty. Beauty is there, whether we see it or not. And that's what I think this movie is, beautiful.",1089072000,33,2800,4.453125
1901291,4,B0000A2ZU3,"How do we reconcile with the mistakes we have made in the past?

Instead of distancing the viewer, the film suggests that we are all capable (if not guilty) of regrettable acts, and goes on to explore the ways a person can be of use in the world as opposed to merely ""taking up space.""  The film has a meditative quality and a deliberate pace, but is very absorbing nonetheless.  An excellent cast and moody soundtrack complement the screenplay.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is that the plot is a bit cliched, and the main philosophical soliloquy is inexplicably recited verbatim twice in the film, so it begins to feel a bit didactic.  Still, a very touching film.",1084406400,3,801,4.566433566433567
1901292,4,B0000A2ZU3,"Manuel Jordan (Billy Bob Thornton) is unexpectedly released from prison after having been incarcerated for two decades for murder, which he solemnly regrets committing.  Free and moving Manuel stops frequently to contemplate his current actions and choices as he reflects on his juvenile mistake that he committed in a small convenient store some twenty years ago.  By choice, based on repent, he ends up in the neighborhood where he committed the murder and by chance he ends up getting a small job as a janitor in a half-way home.  Through his job and leisure time he does everything he can do in order to repent for his past crime.  Manuel seeks up the sister (Holly Hunter) of the young adult that he killed, since he wants to display his regret of his crime.  Levity is a film that gives the audience a chance to reflect on daily decisions and actions as we affect others continuously.  Manuel's pondering is displayed with thoughtful cinematography and supported through a well written script, which leaves the audience with a decent cinematic experience.",1076889600,2,1061,4.932584269662922
1901293,5,B0000A2ZU3,"I have yet to see a movie with Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman, Kirsten Dunst or Holly Hunter that I don't like. And this movie has all of them, so it was set up from the beginning as a movie that stood a big chance of becoming a classic in my book. And it did...
""Levity"" brings forward the solid acting muscle of three consolidated actors and a rising new talent to tell a story about redemption in a way that leaves some ends open, yet makes you get up at the end and think positively about life and potential for overcoming guilt and negative past experiences. All the acting goes on over a tapestry of rich music woven by Mark Oliver Everett, to create one of 2003's most subtle yet powerful dramas.",1072396800,8,707,4.323308270676692

1901295,5,B0000A2ZU3,"LEVITY is a very quiet little sleeper of a movie. Written and directed by Ed Solomon it is a theme and variations on seeking redemption.  A convict who accepts the punishment of life imprisonment for his murder of a young man in a fast food store 22 years prior is abruptly released by a prison board who decide that his exceptional prison behaviour merits his sentence being commuted.  Suddenly thrust from his cell and accepted destiny back into the world where his crime occurred, the man's only drive is to find the sister of his vistim and make amends for his crime.  He walks (somnolently, accompanied by the recurring ghost vision of his victim) thru the dark alleys of some unidentified wintry city, encounters a black 'minister/soup kitchen man', accepts employment as a custodian, and becomes involved with the minister's attempt to salvage the night clubbers who do drugs etc, falling into the chasm of despair from where the convict has history. His presence in this setting has some positive effects on the lost ones' lives.  He finds the sister of the man he murdered and in attempting to make things right, saves her teenage son from his vendetta for revenge of his attempted murder.  Gestures are made, things work out and other things do't work out: we are left without knowing the true results of these attempts at redemption.
The cast includes extraordinarily subdued and subtle performances by Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman, Holly Hunter, and Kirsten Dunst.  The smarmy underbelly of a city is captured authentically and artistcially by the cinematographer, and the director paces this quiet, inward tale with a sense of a death march. Though there is no classical music reference made there is a strong resemblance to the mood and metier of the Shostakovich 15th String Quartet. And as 'chamber music' this fine little film will bear revisiting.",1064793600,6,1871,4.961661341853035
1901296,1,B0000A2ZU3,"When I put this movie in my DVD player, I was expecting a heist with cool characters and snappy dialogue. Obviously I was way off! As the film unravelled ever so slowly, it just got more and more confusing, stupid, and pointless, and it stayed boring. Morgan Freeman's character didn't make sense and didn't have a point or a reason. The same was the case with Kirstin Dunst. I just can't believe that four big named (some highly acclaimed) actors would play these roles. I also can't believe that I sat through this entire movie. All in all, Levity was horrible and torturous. I would rather watch paint dry than watch this again. It is obviously not something that children would want to see, nor would they enjoy. It's R rating reflects a noticable amount of profanity.",1064016000,4,772,4.642335766423358
