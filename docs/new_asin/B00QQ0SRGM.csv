8692274,3,B00QQ0SRGM,"ZAKUROZAKA NO ADAUCHI (SNOW ON THE BLADES / REVENGE OF POMEGRANATE SLOPE [LIT.]).  Rarity: A Samurai Film For Grown Ups!

Rating = ***

Producer:  Shohei Kotaki
Theater (CineMatsuri 2016)
2014

Film = solid three (3) stars; effects = three (3) stars.  Director Setsur Wakamatsu  delivers high drama (without resorting to melodrama) set at the dawn of the Meiji Restoration (a time of radical/rapid cultural change that abolished feudalism and eliminated employment opportunities for the samurai solders who had enforced this fragmented form of autocratic government).  Refreshingly, Wakamatsu does not rely on sword-swinging stunt actors and high body counts to support his film (there is a story-driven modicum of action confined to the opening scenes), but, instead, employs veteran acting talent to carry the tale forward.  This is essentially a two-character photoplay with excellent performances delivered by Kiichi Nakai and Hiroshi Abe.  They are skillful actors who capture and unrelentingly hold the viewer's attention for almost two hours without resorting to the crutches of CGI and set-piece spectacles.  The hallmark of truly great acting!  Unlike what has (unfortunately) become traditional movie samurai-speak (i.e., mumbling/muttering), lines are clearly enunciated as if on the live stage. Wakamatsu also provides a very suspenseful ending.  Actually, two of them!  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color), lighting, set decoration, and sound are very good.  Subtitles are fine.  Snow effects are especially well done. There is one major continuity glitch which occurs in the closing scenes: two swords suddenly appear side-by-side on the ground after one has been sheathed in the previous scene.  Since the Director seems to be making a symbolic point, the sheathing scene would seem well worth reshooting (or cutting).  Highly recommended.

8692275,5,B00QQ0SRGM,"""Zakurozaka no adauchi"" is submitted to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival by Japan. This action-filled historical drama follows the single-minded efforts of a swordsman who failed to protect the Shogun's top minister. He spends the next 13 years trying to rectify his error while Japan modernizes around him.

Award-winning director Setsur Wakamatsu, working from a short story by Jir Asada, brings us a hero who is stubborn to a fault, with a lovely wife whose life is linked to his for better or for worse.

We see:
  * Kiichi Nakai as Shimura Kingo, the samurai whose dogged determination is probably his biggest flaw. He is honor-bound to do what's right.
  * Ryko Hirosue brings us Setsu (I liked her in ""Departures""), Shimura's wife. She is trying to support the two of them as he continues his quest, but times are changing in the last half of the 1800s and not many women buy kimonos anymore.
  *  Hiroshi Abe is Naokichi. Even before we get to know this handsome fellow we can tell he's a nice man because of the way he interacts with the neighbor's little girl.

The cinematography is subdued, with occasional snowflakes drifting into the frame. We are on muddy roads, with either rainy or snowy weather, or having tea in chilly homes. I know Japanese jackets are often padded and I found myself hoping everyone was warm enough. Brrr....

This is the second Samurai-based film I have seen which acknowledges the women whose fates are tied to the warriors'. ""Twilight Samurai"" was the first.

One minor caveat: Do not eat a big meal before you see this one because the pace is so deliberate, you just might doze off and you'd miss a really good movie!",1431648000,3,1671,4.724137931034483
