2864803,5,B000REQQGQ,Was really excited to add these wonderful films to my collection. The price and quality are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly they arrived. Thank you!,1256860800,,169,5.071428571428571
2864804,4,B000REQQGQ,"I found this product worth it for the price.  As other reviewers have noted, it really seems kind of ""slapped together"" in the fact you really are not getting much for added bonus features as one might expect.  What you are getting are the first 3 Alien films, which do include a few tidbits in bonus features, just nothing to in depth.

For most ""Alien"" fans, I would suggest checking out the other package that includes Alien Resurrection, the fourth disc.

The original film, included here, still holds a lot of power in storytelling and terror.  The design of the alien and the alternate mission the crew finds themselves in overshadow the futuristic vessel they are on, what with it's toggle switches and command prompt screens, give it a nearly obsolete yet still nostalgic feel.",1236038400,9,785,4.785185185185185
2864805,5,B000REQQGQ,I received this set as a Christmas gift.  I watched the movies.  They're all great.  This set suits me just fine.,1235260800,,113,4.285714285714286

2864807,3,B000REQQGQ,"To put it bluntly, your better off getting the quadrilogy set than this one. The quality of the films are not there. The only redeeming thing is the price.",1222473600,4,155,4.379310344827586
2864808,5,B000REQQGQ,"As you heared from the other reviewist there is no bonus content in this set. It does contain the first three alien films. Alien, Aliens, and Alien3. Each movie has its own disc and slim-case. Although it is not the complete saga its still a great deal.

Disc 1 - Alien: Theatrical Cut
Disc 2 - Aliens: Special Edition
Disc 3 - Alien3: Theatrical Cut",1212364800,5,350,4.384615384615385
2864809,3,B000REQQGQ,"After purchasing the Triple Pack, I immediately began to notice that this box set didn't really seem to be an ""authentic"" box set. It seemed to be missing key features.

1.) No bonus disc. Typically, box sets include the movies in the series, plus a bonus disc (Think Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, etc)

2.) The aspect ratio isn't consistent. Alien and Alien 3 were 2.40 aspect ratio, while Alien 2 was modified to 1.85. I found that rather strange.

3.) The editions were also not consistent. Alien and Alien 3 were just the regular edition, while Aliens was the Special Edition. Why didn't the set include Alien: Director's Cut and Alien 3: Special Edition?

4.) No authentic box set should use slim DVD cases. That's just wrong.

5.) This is a big one for ""box sets"". There are FOUR Alien movies. Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection. So what happen to Resurrection? Why was it omitted? It's like selling a Star Wars box set and omitting Return of the Jedi, but including the other five.

I understand that there is a Quadrilogy for sale for quite a bit more money (and I highly recommend it), but the question still begs to be answered. Why does this set exist? It seems more like a bootleg flea market bundle of random editions of some, not all, of the Alien movies then a true Alien box set. At least they were the THX Remastered versions, not some straight-from-VHS dump with all its Dolby Surround (3.1) glory that seems to be rather common with DVD conversions of old movies.

Maybe I am just being picky, but I feel this set shouldn't even exist.",1211241600,15,1582,4.549295774647887

2864819,5,B000REQQGQ,"Just watch the first two, skip number three. These DVDs are in really thin cases that make them look bootlegged, so I was a bit concerned, but they turned out to be legit with a menu screen and everything. Alien is a classic and Aliens is a great sequel, but Aliens 3 is only for those who think happy/ambiguous endings are the worst thing ever. If you feel satisfied at the end of Aliens, skip #3 and go on your merry, blissful way.",1480204800,,433,4.228915662650603

2864893,5,B000REQQGQ,"As with any sequel, it is imperative that you start from very beginning, however the first installment of ""ALIEN"" was similar to the ""Star War's"" original. There were ton and tons of unanswered questions. Where did the aliens come from, why were they on that particular planet, who was the ""Space Jockey"" and where did he come from? For all intents and purposes, you can get away with viewing Prometheus first and still totally enjoy the 1st 3 installments. I however would have loved to view Prometheus first. But to real sci fi horror fans, either case will bring satisfaction.",1352764800,2,579,4.8

2864897,5,B000REQQGQ,"What can you say but these movies set the tone for most that followed it...
When I saw the first one I was hooked and I loved all the follow up movies and waited anxiously for them to come out with the others.. never disappointed.
Many did not like 3 but it was a good movie in the long form.. not as good as it it had been made with Scott or Cameron.. but it took the property forward and kept it alive.
Get this set and you will be hooked. Great to have a Alien watching marathon with others who appreciate them.
However you will watch them over and over.
Some the lines in the movies are clutch lines to use in nearly any get togethers with friends who have seen them! ""..It's the only way.. to be sure...""",1324166400,,709,4.071428571428571

2864901,4,B000REQQGQ,"I have actually purchased this DVD trilogy twice now - the first time an old friend borrowed it and never gave it back, so I bought it again.  This DVD combo is a great deal.  The special features are pretty minimal, but as another reviewer said, perfect for the ""casual DVD fan.""  If you like watching a lot of special features, I definitely suggest getting a different version of these movies.  I personally wouldn't buy this if I had to pay full price for it new, but it is a great deal used.  It was less than $10 including shipping for me - such a great deal - couldn't pass it up.

As far as the movies, I'm not a huge fan of Alien 3, but Alien and Aliens are both sci-fi classics.  I think this is a must-own collection.  I really didn't like Alien Resurrection that much, which is why I opted for the trilogy instead of the quadrilogy.  If you like sci-fi, you must buy this!",1304812800,4,883,4.208333333333333

2864904,4,B000REQQGQ,"I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers were critiquing. Some claimed that this set had no bonus content which is completely false. There is a LOT of bonus material on this set, mainly focused on the first two films (Ridley Scott commentary, isolated score, James Cameron interviews, deleted scenes and tons of photos). This is basically the Alien Lagacy set, which was released in the late 90's, minus the horrible 4th film. That sits just fine with me. The one reason I never purchased that set is because I despise that 4th film. Sure, the third isn't near as good as the first 2, but it at least fits in the mood of an Alien film, unlike Resurrection.
If you are hardcore, there is the much more expansive Alien Quadrilogy on DVD, but believe it or not, it excludes some of the bonus content from this set that I really enjoy, so I never traded for the Quad. Now that an all inclusive Blu-Ray release is coming, I think I may upgrade, but this set has served me very well though all of my years of DVD. What you get for the price of this set CANNOT be beat.
And again, there are plenty of bonus features on these disc, particularly the first film. A bonus for me is that these are all in slim packs, which saves room on my shelf. I love slim packs. I never understood why DVD cases had to be so large anyway.
So if you don't have a Blu-ray, and aren't a hardcore fan that must have and watch the expensive, 60+ hour, Holy Grail of Alien sets, this is the perfect choice for the price. Good movies, good features, good sound, good picture...good deal.",1280620800,26,1560,4.32764505119454
