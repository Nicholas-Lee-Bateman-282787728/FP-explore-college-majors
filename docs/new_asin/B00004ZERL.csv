1384050,4,B00004ZERL,"I attended this performance, and even allowing for individual quibbles with various artists heard on this DVD, I believe the sum of its parts are well worth the 'PRICE' of owning it.

This performance,taped live on a Saturday afternoon in 1983, presents the great American diva, soprano LEONTYNE PRICE in one of her most famous Verdi roles. Her performance, factoring in age(57), career(30+ yrs),& the AFTERNOON, is late vintage Price. Certain vocal mannerisms - a cloudy lower voice, sliding portamenti, and scooping - are indeed present in this performance (as they were in some degree since the late '70s). However, they  hardly diminish either the vocal or dramatic impact that Ms. Price brings to this live performance. Her upper register, slightly weaker than before, still rings out minus any wobble and/or false pitches. She sings with beautiful dynamic shadings to accentuate the drama, and still floats pianissimi with little obvious effort. Indeed in this VERDI opera, most of those 'mannerisms' abet the drama, and always did for this particular artist!  Ms. Price's performance as the tragic Leonora di Vargas here is heartfelt, passionate, and deeply moving. As there are no other full-length taped commercial opera performances available of this legendary soprano, this VHS/DVD is all the more treasurable for a glimpse of what made LEONTYNE PRICE the reigning Verdi soprano for the past 40 yrs! Tenor Giuseppe Giacomini, while more protean vocally, sings crudely, giving a loud, unsubtle, yet dramatically tenable portrayal of the unfortunate Don Alvaro, complete with a bawling middle, somewhat off-set by ringing high notes. Leo Nucci is a lightweight Verdi baritone, lacking the customary heft and tonal warmth associated with the role of Don Carlo di Vargas. He nonetheless produces exciting vocalism, enhanced by committed acting, and HIS thrilling high notes as well. Mezzo-soprano Isola Jones acts well, looks lovely, but is a barely adequate Preziosilla vocally, with a weak middle voice & a short top. Bonaldo Giaotti's portrayal of Padre Guardiano is somewhat stolid, but his basso is authoritative, and also is beautifully produced. Maestro James Levine's love & mastery of this sprawling masterpiece( the RCA CD version with Price/Domingo/Milnes is magnificent)is evident throughout, birnging clarity to the inherent contrasts between searing, private dramas, and all the lively interludes that occur on the battlefield and amongst the Italian countrysides. Overall,this is a very fine VHS/DVD to own - not the overall best taped performance (Tebaldi, Corelli, etc 1959)- but a Special one for those seeking a cohesive, modern performance of ""La Forza del Destino"", and starring one of its most celebrated artists, ""La Splendissima"" soprano Leontyne Price LIVE!!  Note: A ""cut"" (the Soldier's Chorus) while regrettable, is hardly FATAL. Enjoy!

Dear Readers,
I rarely comment on reviewers opinions and posts, as the art and success of of singing is highly subjective in most genres. Opera singing, while not exempt from said subjectivity, does indeed have requsite elements that dictate skill, musicality, and the ability to sing in tune amongst others. Tonal standards can be disputed, but most Operaphile I'm aware of, regard aging Artists' ability to phonate in pitch, sing without a wobble, and at least provide a reasonable reminder of their artistry to be anything that approachs the word 'DISASTER""!  As most listeners have discerned over the years, Operatic Perfection is the province of recording studios - not staged performances, as a general rule. Knowledge of this art form - to expose one's ignorance publicly, while providing criticsm speaks for itself - seems to emanate from the product of those microphones. Indeed, in at least one review of Madame Price's performance in the reviewed FORZA, the reviewer referred to her earlier ""recordings"". This DVD presented a LIVE performance without the luxury/security of re-takes, et al!

I will not quibble here with anyone regarding their opinion/review of La Price's performance in the afroementioned ""FORZA"".

However, I wish to state that the disrespect shown (in some of the posts here)is both appalling and shameful! This esteemed Artist, whose LIVE performances almost never ceased to elicit frenzy from her audiences - not to mention consistent praise from the most knowledgeable, demanding, and sometimes harshest critics Internationally - deserves better. I am an unabashed, longtime admirer of LEONTYNE PRICE, and have attended HER performances and OTHER greats of her generation - time and time again. NO artist deserves such callow and unremitting cruelty, let alone a cherished artist of Miss Price's calibre - even at her advanced age in 1982. In the reviewed FORZA, she sang Verdi's music with feeling, passion, poignancy,and more than a few moments of great vocal beauty, with thefinal Bflat of the ""Pace"" ringing out in inimitable fashion. Whatever criticisms you & others may have regarding Leontyne Price's overall contributions in the reviewd FORZA (and some of yours were quite accurate) it should be only fair to provide a balanced assessment, avoid gross generalizations, and acknowledge what actually exists for potential listeners of this dvd - AND performances therein. LEONTYNE PRICE is regarded by many in the International Operatic community to have been America's Greatest soprano (pace Ms. Sills)since Rosa Ponselle in terms of vocalism, accomplishment, & yes, longevity on the INTERNATIONAL stages. She & Mr. Cornell MacNeil - another superlative American artist - have earned the right to be respected and allowed their due by ALL Operaphile, whatever individual opinions may be otherwise. I urge you ALL to remember Artists' overall contributions to the musical landscape when judging their individual efforts - especially in their ""twilight years"". Basta!!

1384051,5,B00004ZERL,"I think this DVD shows how underrated of a performer Giuseppe Giacomini is. The only other singer to have sung the part of Alvaro so well was Franco Corelli. This is an astounding voice! If you like Giacomini, check out his live CD of Otello. That is a great recording of a terrific production as well.
Leontyne Price also sings an amazing Leonora. The wonderful thing about Price is that there was rarely a time when she did not sing beautifully in her entire career. Overall I am thrilled with this recording. I frequently view it to the annoyance of all non-operalovers who happen to be present.",999820800,23,598,4.598130841121495
1384052,4,B00004ZERL,"This March 24, 1984 matinee performance of Forza Del Destino at the Met documents the old Eugene Berman production which premiered in 1952 with Milanov, Tucker, Warren and Siepi. The sets do not look their age (indeed they look far better than the many ""concept"" productions we are forced to sit through today) and the camerawork and lighting bring the opera vividly to life on the small screen.  Now for the singing.  Giacomini and Nucci are the big, ""stand up and sing"" voices needed in this opera and they deliver as promised.  Some vocal insecurity from Giacomini toward the begining of the opera may be due to nerves -- but things improve as the opera proceeds.  Isola Jones gives a sassy and vocally smokey interpretation of  Preziosilla -- a role usually given almost to comprimarios today.  As for Leontyne Price -- her devoted fans will bask in her vocal sumptuous performance.  Admittedly, however, this is rather late Price and by this time in her career, while still vocally secure and shimmering, many, many mannerisms have crept into her interpretation that in the beginning of her career would never have been attempted or tolerated.  Her over-employment of straight tone, exaggerated downward portamentos and occasional lack of rhythmic precision give this reviewer a great deal of trouble -- however, many of her steadfast  fans will love this performance no matter what -- to each their own.  David Stivender's then magnificent Met Chorus delivers some memorable moments: particularly the men in the monks scene with Leonora.  Levine as usual conducts with masterful drive and sensitivity.  Except for my stylistic reservations about Price,( and those may not affect you,) I highly recommend this Met Telecast on Pioneer for any serious opera lovers collection. Elektra and Lohengrin are rumored to be released soon.  Keep them coming Pioneer -- only Elisir, Don Carlo and Troyens remain unreleased on DVD after that.",988329600,39,1935,5.104761904761904

I highly recomend it, just brace yourself for the cuts.",986342400,23,320,4.129032258064516
1384064,3,B00004ZERL,"This MET production release is a tribute to Leontyne Price and nothing more. She is not in top form here.  During the period just before her retirement,  her performances became more inconsistent than was her norm.  Usually a very accurate singer, her intonation here strays, especially in the forte sections.  She still has moments of sublime phrasing and she maintains her character through the inconsistencies.

As Don Carlos, Leo Nucci is underpowered.  Usually a singer who has no problem projecting in a large theater, here he sounds as though he may have had a throat problem and he was trying to nurture it.  In any case, his usual ""ping"" is not there but his tendency to sing sharp is still evident. In the scene that closes act three, his slight sharpening of the pitch draws attention to Giuseppe Giacomini's own intonation problems.  Through much of this performance, Giacomini's intonation sinks as he goes for the high forte.  He was the greatest disappointment to me in the performance.  I have heard all three in the theater at one time or another, and can attest that this was not a good day for any of them.

This dvd is worth getting for three reasons. The first is Ms. Price. Though not in top vocal form, the artistry she brings to one of her signature roles exceeds most of her rivals.  The second is James Levine. Here, he has captured the essence of the ""Force"" of destiny and drives the story forward to its ethereal conclusion.  The final reason is that dispute the singers not being in top form, these are ""Verdi Singers"" singing Verdi. With the lack of such in today's opera world, it is good to hear how it should be done.",1364860800,3,1651,4.632302405498282

This opera has a fantastic story, with sublime music and libretto and fantastic performances by everyone but Leontyne Price. I have to agree with other reviewers. We must resist idolizing greatness after its time by allowing them to appear in operas when they are past their prime both vocally and in age. I mean come on....the role called for a 20 year old with a youthful and powerful voice. You won't see movie moguls casting a 50 year past old plump movie star in the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind or as Blanche in Streetcar Named Desire. So why do we do this in opera? Quite frankly I now have to look for another La Forza del Destino for my library....because this is not it.

1384069,2,B00004ZERL,"I am appalled by all the praise heaped on this DVD.  There are many good things about most MET productions but often they utilize a big name who is well past their singing years.  Why can nobody see that Price's performance is a DISASTER!  We all remember her early recordings which were full of wonderful singing.  But by the time this performance was taped she was less than a charicature of her former self.  Her tone is often hollow, she approximates most of the melodic lines and doesn't bother with many consonances.  Yes, its a shame we have nothing from her best years but lets admit that this the present performance is nothing to rave about. Like the MET Rigoletto which faltered on McNeil's long past retirement lead, this should never been released.

Sadly, here is another great work for which there is no really adequate performance on DVD.",1190073600,17,854,4.691275167785235

1384072,3,B00004ZERL,"This performance is worth having as a reasonably good representation of ""Forza del Destino"", an opera not abundantly available on DVD, but more so for the presence of Leontyne Price in one of her greatest Verdi roles.  True, the voice is not as resplendent and luscious as it was some seasons earlier, but the grand authority and imperial voice remain intact.  I really wonder who could sing this role as well today as Price does on this Met video. Like Zinka Milanov before her, Price is a Verdi soprano to the manner born, and her bearing and personage alone makes her assuption of this role treasurable.  Granted ------ it would have been better for her to have appeared in a DVD of this opera a few years earlier, but in her case, it's better late than never.  Now if the Met would only release her farewell 1985 Aida, which, while not as vocally infallable as it was a few years earlier, is still good enough to blow all of the other competition away.",1125014400,20,956,4.508670520231214
1384073,4,B00004ZERL,"Although La forza del destino is not my favorite opera by Verdi, it does showcase Leontyne Price's magnificent voice. At times it almost seemed as if the composer had written it for her.  As for the DVD, it is wonderful to be able to view the opera singers up close (something one never sees on the stage, even with opera glasses)and see the emotion on their faces. The lighting was quite dramatic, although I was a bit disappointed in the sets and expected much more from the Met (as I have seen far better and grander sets at the local operas where I live).  All in all though, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who admires Leontyne Price, as well as to anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to see her perform. Brava!",1048896000,13,724,4.395522388059701
7928531,3,B00004ZERL,"We have two disparate productions of Verdi's ""La forza del destino"" on DVD:  The first is from the Teatro di San Carlo, in Naples (before a volatile audience), on March 15, 1958, starring Renata Tebaldi, Ettore Bastianini, Franco Corelli, Oralia Domnguez, Boris Christoff, and Renato Capecchi, conducted by Francesco Molinari-Pradelli.  (It is distributed by VAI.)

The production is so provincial, we do not even know the name of the stage director.  But, the singers!  They were some of the greatest voices of the age, all in their primes.  Tebaldi, famed for not being a good actress, is here rather charming.  She had learned a series of stock gestures, which she gracefully executes.  She seems not to have any linear intensity, and this is particularly noticeable in her last Act aria, which is devoid of tragic stature.  Her middle voice is very beautiful, but nearing even the approach of a high note, the soprano lowers her chin and acquires a fixed look of painful concentration, exiting whatever characterization she had been trying to maintain.  These high notes all are constricted, somewhat flat in pitch, and sometimes released with a yelp.  Would we had film of, say, her contemporaries Maria Callas or Herva Nelli in this opera!

Bastianini is, from first to last and in every way, magnificent in this performance.  Corelli was acknowledged as being very handsome, but here the baritone is even more so.  Even via the translation of an old kinescope, Corelli's voice is thrilling, and he sings with great passion in a role ideal for his talents.

Domnguez is an absolute delight as Preziosilla.  The Mexican mezzo-soprano displays a winning personality and fine voice.  Christoff's Slavic voice is a marvel, but he seems without expression, and his unfortunate wig and false beard make him resemble a cross between Bozo the Clown and Santa Claus.  Capecchi, with the ""traditional"" false-nose, is excellent as Fra Melitone.  The subtitles, on both versions, make the usual, tiresome mistake of confusing friars with monks.

As noted, the production is terrible, with old sets and non-existent direction.  One still can see echoes of this approach to opera in the American provinces, though a misunderstood, misapplied version of the Method (completely ill-suited to opera) has taken possession of today's singers, replacing the elegant, slightly-stylized approach of the acclaimed singers seen in this historic Neapolitan performance.

The second performance is from the Metropolitan Opera, on March 24, 1984, featuring Leontyne Price, Giuseppe Giacomini, Leo Nucci, and Bonaldo Giaiotti, conducted by James Levine, with John Dexter as stage director.

Dexter was one of the greatest directors of his generation, but this production is not representative of his work.  It was a ""revised"" version of a production first seen in 1952 (when it was staged by Herbert Graf), when the Met needed ""La forza"" but could not mount a fresh production of it in 1974.  (In fact, during the season of this telecast, Mr Dexter actively discouraged the present author from seeing it in the theatre.)  A few examples of his ethos can be seen, nevertheless, in the religious processions, the tableau that opens Act III, and the interesting method of the sororicide.

Miss Price was one of the most beloved sopranos of her time, but by the time of this telecast she was fifty-seven years old.  It was not her voice that had disintegrated, but her stylistic manner.  Her vocalism is replete with scoops, whoops, sliding up to notes, and careening down to the next pitch.  It makes a strange, parodistic effect, is very mannered, and is in no way idiomatic.  (Today, Rene Fleming often creates a similar effect.)  Her acting is admirable for its simplicity and sincerity, but it, too, by Act III seems to have descended into parody.

Giacomini has a major instrument, but does not have the stage presence of a theatre creature.  The extreme close-ups, so beloved by American television, serve no one well in this cast.  Nucci, contrariwise, gives a flamboyant portrayal of Don Carlos di Vargas.  Giaiotti, with nothing like the instrument of Christoff (see above), portrays good Padre Guardiano in a completely satisfying fashion.

Also in the cast is Isola Jones as a sultry Preziosilla, and Anthony Laciura gives one of his finest characterizations as Mastro Trabuco.  The Melitone is highly exaggerated, but John Darrenkamp presents a fine cameo as the surgeon who saves the life of Don Alvaro, the tenor.

Regarding studio recordings on Compact Discs, the EMI set (1986) conducted in volcanic fashion by Riccardo Muti has Plcido Domingo, Mirella Freni (unfortunately replacing the announced Renata Scotto), Giorgio Zancanaro, Paul Plishka, Sesto Bruscantini, Giorgio Surian, and Dolora Zajic in the cast.  It is electrifying.  Elsewhere, one finds the epochal Leonora of Callas (EMI, 1954), and the brilliant, scintillating Preziosilla of Susanne Marsee in a ""pirate"" recording from San Francisco (1976).",1503878400,,5002,5.187032418952619

Brother pursues boy and sister.
Boy kills brother.
Sister kills herself.

OK.  That is the plot in brief.
Verdi really didn't need a perfect plot, as opera-goers of that era (or perhaps any era) came to hear good melodies and their favorite singers.
The plot was just a loose framework to tie the great songs together.

This is Verdi, so there really are some nice melodies.  The ""Fate"" theme appears throughout, reminding everyone that in spite of humankind's  best attempts, Fate will declare the final results.  Some of the lovely melodies include the gypsy, Preziosilla's song about the joys of being a soldier, Leonora's prayer to the Madonna, the violin theme of the monks with their candles, and the gut-wrenching agony of Don Alvaro and Leonora, as they become aware of the impossibility of escaping her father's curse, and the power of Fate.

The Met Orchestra and James Levine do full justice to the music, and the staging is in appropriate costuming and appropriate darkness for most of the scenes.

Leontyne Price, although in the twilight of her career at this recording, sings with mastery and loveliness.  Leo Nucci sings, excellently, the role of her brother, Don Carlo di Vargas.  Don Alvaro, Leonora's lover is sung energetically by Giuseppe Giacomini.

There are not many dvds of La Forza, and this is among the better ones.  Technically, the audio seems fine, but the remastering of the video is occasionally blurry or offering a ghostlike blur when the actors move suddenly.  This aspect is less than perfect, but considering that this is a chance to see Leontyne Price in a live performance at the Met, it's not a serious flaw.",1455408000,2,2267,4.794344473007712

7928538,5,B00004ZERL,"When I decided to buy a DVD of Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino,""  I was confronted at Amazon.com with a number of excellent choices.  I've no doubt that this performance from the Metropolitan Opera must certainly be among the best.  Giuseppe Giacomini as Don Alvaro is in fine voice and looks handsome and eminently suited to the role.  Leontyne Price is, as usual, wonderful in her interpretation of the Verdi soprano roles as Leonora.  Bonaldo Giaiotti as Padre Guardiano sings beautifully and plays the role with impeccable dignity.  Isola Jones is a most pleasant surprise as the gypsy Preziosilla.  She looks seductive, sings exquisitely and simply lights up the entire stage with her presence during her relatively brief appearances in Acts II and III.  Leo Nucci is in fine voice as Don Carlo di Vargas.

The quality of the DVD is excellent both from  audio and visual points of view although occasionally subtitles fail to appear.  I think it would be difficult to improve on the music and singing that we get during this wonderful performance.  From an acting point of view, however, the performance is somewhat dated and lack the attention to acting that we currently get in Metropolitan opera performances under the Gelb administration.  Some of the acting interpretations are actually quite silly and Enrico Fissore as Fra Melitone hams the role up to an extreme.  There is none of the subtlety we encounter in Verdi's other great comic character, namely Falstaff.  It's really surprising that Forza actually followed such masterpieces as Rigoletto, La Traviata and Un Ballo in Maschera chronologically.  The rambling libretto by Francesco Piave is really embarrassing  in parts and even current singers with better training in acting interpretations would have difficulty making the characters look more believable.  The opera plot is really nothing more than a series of coincidences that strain credulity and destiny is hardly linked at all to the rambling plot.

 Notwithstanding all these minor quibbles, this is music and singing that will thrill any lover of Verdi's operas.  Leonora's scene with Padre Guardiano in Act II is one of the finest in all Verdi as Ms. Price's magnificent voice soars over the voices of the monks in ""La Vergine degli angeli."" Other highlights are the ""Solenne in quest' ora'"" duet made famous by Caruso and Scotti, and the magnificent duet between Don Alvaro and Don Carlos in Act IV.  The ""Il santo nome di Dio Signore"" in Scene three of Act one is another treat.  It was wonderful too to see the vigorous conducting of a much younger James Levine who brings out the best in the great Met orchestra.  This is, in conclusion, a wonderful performance of Verdi's Forza.  One wonders whether it would be possible to assemble a cast of this excellence in the present time and maybe that is why the opera is not often given nowadays?",1392854400,7,2874,4.949895615866389
