5101505,5,B007NYZ9PC,One of his favorite places is Yosemite- The DVD was exceptionally well done and he enjoyed it alot! Would highly recommend to anyone-great for family viewing!,1357257600,,158,5.115384615384615
5101506,1,B007NYZ9PC,"I'm glad I purchased this for only $4- and still, I want to return it. The video is shaky and sub-par. It feels almost as if the camera was hand held with the exception of the first two city shots in the beginning. I had to turn it off after about 5 minutes into the film. Don't expect anything like you see in National Geographic- This is just video taken straight out of camera with no color or contrast added to it.

It might be worth some background noise- but again, it looks like they cut some funding by having an unknown narrator who awkwardly pronouncing everything.

I was highly disappointed.",1356739200,11,603,4.423423423423423
5101507,5,B007NYZ9PC,Words cannot describe the awesome journey this video will take you on. The photography is superb almost to the point that there are places your tummy will get a little quesy from the altitude and speed of the vehicle you are traveling in.,1355875200,,238,4.558139534883721
5101508,1,B007NYZ9PC,"I have been to Yosemite many times and love the place. This DVD does not do it justice. The DVD is advertised as Blue Ray, but I don't think it really is. The images, such as they are, not that good. You don't see the detail that is normally seen in a Blue Ray DVD. Also, large parts of this movie seem to have been filmed during or just after a forest fire. The air is filled with haze and smoke. The scenery, draped in smoke and haze, is just not that good. The narration and production values are amateurish. All in all, this DVD was not worth my time and not worth $4.99.",1355011200,3,575,4.052631578947368
5101509,3,B007NYZ9PC,"At first I thought that this may have been done several years ago. But it stated 2012 at the end. In this day and age, I would have thought the PQ would have been a better quality. The subject matter was OK and informative, but would have been better with a higher grade of video.",1347062400,12,280,4.109090909090909
5101510,3,B007NYZ9PC,"The video is not HD quality, more like DVD quality and throughout the video, if only they used better narrative.",1343001600,17,112,4.65
5101511,5,B007NYZ9PC,"As a youngster at school I was tought very little about US geography, but over later years through the advent of television etc. have managed to learn more. This blu ray confirms that the US is one of the the most beautiful countries in the world. A very educational disc.",1342656000,,272,4.46

5101521,5,B007NYZ9PC,"This is a great series and we love Yosemite and the history, so seeing this gives us a different perspective and an excellent history of the development of the land. Wow, what a neat idea! We've been going there for years and camping out but this is a whole new look. Amazing!",1406851200,,276,4.326923076923077

5101523,5,B007NYZ9PC,Beautiful and a place we would have liked to go if we could still travel.  We should have included this area whenever we had gone west.,1399334400,,135,4.1923076923076925
5101524,5,B007NYZ9PC,This National Parks series is superb. It makes you feel like you are right there. Our entire family is viewing these wonderful and educational series. We all want to visit there now and I am placing these phenomenal parks on my bucket list.,1395273600,,240,4.604651162790698
5101525,4,B007NYZ9PC,"Some documentatries lack ""soul"". This one is balanced precariously close to that group.
If filler is required to flesh out a blu-ray disc, the director missed their mark.",1379894400,,170,5.107142857142857
5101526,5,B007NYZ9PC,"Howdy;

It might have been better to call this ""The High Sierra"" as it is not just Yosemite, but also Kings Canyon, Sequoia National Parks and Devil's Postpile National Monument.  However, it doesn't matter what you call it, it is still a great addition to the series.

Great video, narration, music and interviews, with a running time of 71 minutes, I would and do recommend this and all in this series to all that love the great outdoors.

L8R daze...",1378080000,,453,4.625
5101527,4,B007NYZ9PC,This film exposed the majestic beauty of this park and balance the environmental issues faced here. This one was not all doom and gloom.,1365033600,,136,4.708333333333333
5101528,3,B007NYZ9PC,"I have been spoiled by BBC and Discovery documentaries. This pales in comparison to them. Looks like my personal video in content, presentation and format. Great injustice to the scenic mountains.
I paid like $5 in local Target, but it's not even worth that.",1364169600,2,258,4.886363636363637
5101529,1,B007NYZ9PC,It looks like an amateur production. I was disappointed because the old DVD sold in the park is much better than National Parks Exploration Series: Yosemite.,1363046400,3,157,5.076923076923077
5101530,5,B007NYZ9PC,"This DVD really showed the beauty of the mountains and the National Park.  My husband and I watched it and it gave us a view of what it had, it's history and what exciting things
we could see.  This one showed beautiful photography from the mountain tops.  The color was beautiful.  It taught me a lot.  I felt like I was flying high with the photographer and pilot as they showed the beauty of the place.  I'm a photographer and this DVD did tell me a lot!",1360972800,,457,4.195402298850575
8519804,5,B007NYZ9PC,"Beautiful, and I thought it was wonderful to see all the beauty!
 I also thought the people who worked therehow lucky they are.
A lot of good information that I enjoyed.
My focus was on the Positive of this great presentation!!!",1522800000,,228,4.560975609756097

8519807,1,B007NYZ9PC,"I was hoping for inspiring videos of some of our greatest national parks and bought three in the  series. The only good thing I can say about this Yosemite video is that it was better than the other two, but not by much. The aerial videography was jerky enough it was painful to watch. None of the video was sharp enough to justify the blu-ray media, the narration wasn't very interesting and the interviews with various people involved with Yosemite in some way felt like really bad reality TV. If you get the impression that I'm not impressed (positively), you'd be 100% correct. I'd strongly recommend saving your money and look for another Yosemite video. How disappointing, as were the other two national park videos I purchased.",1497744000,,734,4.7795275590551185
8519808,5,B007NYZ9PC,"Many fine pictures.  With every drought, the picture changes.  These DVD helicopter views are welcomed variations to my Yosemite bookshelf.",1491091200,,139,5.9

8519812,1,B007NYZ9PC,"Poor quality camera work. Narration was so stilted I had to turn off the sound. Since I didn't like the sound or the video, I returned it.  Wilderness Video makes a much better version, with stunning camera work, good narration and the option to turn off the narration and just hear music or just natural sounds.",1468195200,2,312,4.571428571428571
