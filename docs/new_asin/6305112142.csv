972291,3,6305112142,"Following hot on the trail of Carry On Constable (1959), Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas came up with a slightly less ambitious comedy with Carry On Regardless. There is really no strong backbone of a plot in this one with it centering around The Helping Hands Agency. The Agency takes on six unemployed men and women and one of the clerks at the labour exchange who decides to join them in a quest for a new, more exciting job. They each find themselves plunged into a very odd, diverse range of assigments, which range from taking a chimp out for the day, trying to stay sober at a wine tasting and demonstrating new pieces of equipment at the Ideal home Exhibition. Of course being a Carry on film, everything they put their hands to turns horribly wrong! As there is just basically a series of sketches, the film overly feels disjointed and there is a feeling of something missing that you can't quite put your finger on. This is, however, nothing to do with the cast who are all on top form and are all clearly having a ball. The cast of regulars include Sid James, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Hattie Jaques (yet again in the role of Matron) and the bumbling ecccentric, Kenneth Connor. Certainly some laughs to be had and some sequences are consistently amusing but the film is patchy and at times shows signs of not quite knowing where its going. If you're a big carry on fan then its still worth a look.
Carry On Cruising (1962) saw the series transferred into colour but the one thing missing from this is the large number of regulars absent from it - theres no Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims or Hattie Jaques. Yet surprisingly this does emerge as an enjoyable, entertaining entry in the long-running series. The action of course is set aboard a Mediterranean cruise liner (well actually it was all filmed at PineWood Studios) with the inept and typically incompentent crew under the strict command of the serious and uptight Captain Crowther, who is played marvelously by Sid James. Things all come to a climax when the crew plan a surprise party for the captain who is celebrating his tenth year at sea. This was Norman Hudis's last script for the series, which is certainly on top form throughout. Amongst the cast include Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor (in a fairly typical role), Dilys Laye (taking the role that was origanally written for Joan Sims), Liz Frazer, Lance Percival as a hopelessly sea-sick chef and loveable eccentric Esma Cannon.
Both of these early entries in the Carry On series are defintley worth a look. By no means are they amongst the best but certainly are entertaining.",1036195200,3,2622,4.702173913043478
972292,3,6305112142,"Fun and games aboard a Mediterranean cruise liner with the group of passengers and crew members under the command of the strict, no nonsense Captain Crowther (marvelously played by SID JAMES). This was the first entry in the series to be made in colour. There are many laughs along the way although is slightly handicapped by the absence of most of the regulars. Only SID JAMES, KENNETH WILLIAMS and KENNETH CONNOR, the series ""official"" regulars are present. DILYS LAYE takes on a part origanally written for JOAN SIMS (who was unable to take the part due to illness). LIZ FRAZER (who appeared in many of the early entries) and ESMA CANNON are also on view as well as LANCE PERCIVAL as a hopelessly sea sick chef. On the whole though a good comedy, defintley worth a look.",978998400,,773,4.649635036496351
972293,3,6305112142,"Although the trend is to rate the earlier Carry On's such as this 1962 release more favourably than the later entries I cannot agree with this. In my view, the comic stars reached their peak with films such as Carry On Up  the Khyber and Carry On Again Doctor. Sid James is fine here as the ship's  captain (although a bit wooden in comparison to later work) and Dilys Laye  and Lance Percivial are also competent. The best performance comes from  Kenneth Williams, the most talented team member. To its credit, the film  has beautiful colour and some solid laughs. Not the best of even  the early  Carry On's (Constable & Nurse are better) although I'm sure fans will  enjoy it.",949449600,5,679,4.553719008264463

972393,4,6305112142,"There are no real surprises in any Carry On film. So don't expect to be taken on any exciting magical mystery tour by the plot - it's delightfully irrelevant.
What you can expect is classic camp British comedy. It was never intended to be ""politically correct"",in an age where that concept didn't exist. And yet it is never intended to be offensive - even with typical cheeky innuendo.[Interestingly,you hear the always dithering Esme Cannon as her character practises foreign phrases including  ""I'd rather not discuss Suez"".So there are obvious detours to avoid controversy.
 Elsewhere there are high speed motorways to deliver you straight to the punchline,which you can almost always guess as soon as the set-up has begun. Every sight gag,physical comedy and corny pun is performed exactly as we would want each player to do. This is why these cast regulars,like Sidney James and Kenneth Williams were such legendary favourites of British entertainment.
 It's definitely from a bygone era,but it's clearly timeless",1430352000,,1018,5.233128834355829

This was the first time I'd seen it, heard this was a series where the actors carry on their comedy in other storylines...some said this was the best of the bunch so I'm glad I watched this first.
