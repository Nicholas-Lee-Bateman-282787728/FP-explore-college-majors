4644473,5,B005BQTUU4,"How could anyone not find this show hilarious? The only thing that sucks about it is that it is only one season.

Will Arnett and David Cross deliver with a host of excellent supporting roles.",1433376000,,192,4.485714285714286
4644474,4,B005BQTUU4,"This is borderline surreal.  Especially the rich neighbor, and the conniving servants.  The surface seems to be a pretty standard sitcom, but underneath there are some deeply subversive gags going on.  Only lasted a season, which was a damn shame.",1409443200,,247,5.125
4644475,3,B005BQTUU4,"The plot was shallow and silly and the male lead fit the plot and script.  A dissapointment! Don't bother seeing it.  Rev. Dr. James Rush, SC. ""oristorush@bellsouth.net""",1397865600,,169,5.222222222222222
4644476,5,B005BQTUU4,"This show is so funny. The comedy is a lot like Arrested Development, which I love. I definitely recommend it.",1389744000,,110,4.55
4644477,3,B005BQTUU4,I really wanted to love this show since I am an Arrested Development fan. Running Wilde had potential but sadly it didn't live up to it. It did though have some hilarious moments and the storyline wasn't the worst. It is worth checking out.,1341878400,,240,4.4772727272727275
4644478,2,B005BQTUU4,"I REALLY wanted to like this show!  And, it has great moments.  I loved Arrested Development, and Will Arnett is hilarious.  Glad he bounced back with Up All Night (he's funny in it, and married on screen to STILL HOT and funny Kelly Bundy, er Christina Applegate).  And Arnett IS funny in this, Kerry Russel is good, they have great chemistry, good delivery, just something was off in the writing?  The stories were nothing special, the premise of the show had potential, but just didn't get anywhere.  The pacing was odd and jumbled.  Mom and daughter are living in a tree house one episode, living in the mansion the next, Emmy hates luxury one second, then has absolutly no principles in the next scene.  Could it have been funny?  Maybe if given some time to find out exactly what it is, but it seems rushed and poorly written.  If only the writers had focused on what was working instead of trying to create tension between Arnett and Russel's characters.  Any time neighbor Fa'ad is on screen it's hilarious, this is a character that works.  And it was nice to see some of Arrested Development's alumni back together.  Overall, just didn't live up to what should have been!",1333756800,,1180,4.642512077294686
4644479,3,B005BQTUU4,"From what I heard, the network wanted a mainstream hit, and hired a few Arrested Development cats to ""Hip it up"" yet wouldn't let them do their thing. It wasn't until about the 5th episode they removed the vice from their testicles, but by then it was WAY too late, and the final few episodes didn't even air. Kari didn't do too badly of a job, the little girl was cute and the Andy Richter episode was by far the most consistent. Other than that, it was more miss than hit.",1329177600,,474,4.21978021978022
4644480,5,B005BQTUU4,"I was so sorry to see this show leave my weekly lineup!  Not only had I fallen in love with the eccentric, hilarious characters but so had every demographic in my family. This is a show we will watch over and over either on DVD or Apple TV but in the back of our minds, we will always be wishing there were new episodes headed our way.",1326240000,2,335,4.0
4644481,5,B005BQTUU4,I loved Arrested Development and I'm glad Will Arnett has basically the same funny personality. I laugh so much watching him and his funny situations!,1318982400,,150,5.04
4644482,1,B005BQTUU4,"I shouldn't have assumed that there was hope for the show solely based on the fact that Will Arnett and some writers from Arrested Development were involved. The writing is terrible. Boring, bad story line and none of the characters are good. They are bad choices maybe, Keri Russell is unbearable to watch. David Cross was perfect for Tobias, but in this show he is trying to live off the fame from Arrested Development. Makes me sad to say because I love Will Arnett, but this is awful.",1317772800,,488,4.556818181818182
