8385181,3,B002ZNJOX4,A lot of fine architecture and every convenience leaves little opportunity for humans to reach the fine virtues.,1435276800,,112,5.277777777777778
8385182,3,B002ZNJOX4,"Informative. Gives good, basic information. It's one of my very favorite places, but if I hadn't already been there, I'm not sure this film would have enticed me to go.",1420416000,,168,4.633333333333334
8385183,4,B002ZNJOX4,Seasoned Traveler programs provide an interesting and informative look at a variety of locations that interest us.  The Vancouver Island program was of interest to us as it helped rekindle memories of some of the sights from previous visits to the island.  We enjoyed this program.,1385510400,,281,5.086956521739131
8385184,4,B002ZNJOX4,"We love watching travel shows because we do not travel except through tv.
I just wished the video's were longer.",1379116800,,112,4.65
8385185,3,B002ZNJOX4,"good picture, very weak audio.  I can not hear the sound on this video at normal levels, when I turn my system up to higher than normal listening, it sounds OK.  thanks to a higher power amp/receiver in the system.  the problem is in the program on the disc, as it does the same thing on all my DVD, or Blu Ray players. (my blu ray players play DVDs too) I just wonder if the problem lies with in the master, as I ordered this to replace a copy that had weak audio, still the same thing here.  I have noticed this with some DVDs from the Video Store (video Store DVDs)  before.  who ever produces these videos may need to improve the recording of the audio on some shows, this is a sign of a low budget production.  Photography was fair, how ever.  to improve an image of a production career try getting some better equipment, then get familiar with how to get the most out of it.",1363392000,,880,4.165680473372781
