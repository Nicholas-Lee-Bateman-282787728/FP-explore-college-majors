I've seen it several times (recorded off telly broadcast) and it is undeniably one of the absolute greatest musical time capsule's of the early sixties. Probably THE greatest. If you are at all interested in this period of music, Pop Gear will keep you entertained over and over. If you're a musician with roots in this era, it's the nearest thing you'll ever get to a time machine. It's utterly fascinating... you will note the complete lack of so many pop/rock tropes; when this was made, those tropes didn't even exist yet.  Yes, OF COURSE, they're miming - no studio would ever consider putting up with the unthinkable noise of a live performance! The guitars and keyboards are unselfconsciously not plugged in because no one thought that the audience would even notice such a thing.

You can watch these performances over and over again and always pick up on nuances you overlooked previously. One small example; during the Animals performance of The House of The rising Sun, you can catch guitarist Hilton Valentine's barely restrained smirk ... ""Look mum, I'm on telly!"" Susan Maughan is a total goddess. The Nashville Teens rip through their incredible and hugely influential ""Tobacco Road."" Perhaps the most amazing moment of all is when the Spencer Davis group are performing ""My Babe,"" a fairly nondescript number but mildly catchy - when the guitar break happens Stevie Winwood steps forward and lets rip and it's like the vibe completely explodes and the music is elevated orders of magnitude. And he was only 14 at the time!!!! Just amazing.

There are too many highlights to mention in this treasure trove of British '60s pop. Let's hope it resurfaces soon.",1481760000,3,1726,4.961937716262976

8174585,5,B000N3T2GW,"This was a great compilation of many of the British Invasion bands as they appeared  about 1965. Although it was lip synched, it showed many of the British Invasion groups with their hit songs. I got a tape from the ""70""s as it aired one night. It was great but can't find the tape. Would really like to see this on DVD. It was named "" Go Go Mania"" also.",1210204800,7,354,4.057142857142857
8174586,5,B000N3T2GW,"Remarkable look at British Invasion Bands from the mid-60's.  So, where is this DVD?  The description says June 2007, but it clearly has not been released to DVD here; and the amazon.co. UK site only offers Region 2, so it won't play here.  Too bad.  It's a priceless collection.",1193443200,9,279,4.63265306122449
