But when people bring out the tarot i sort of loose it and just go away. Do you think the initiates in Egypt was given a tarot deck as they entered the sanctuaries?
Hardly, so why waste so much time on what can only be described as ""fluff"" or a ""silly curiocity"" for people living with a magical world view? There are 4 dominant world views, and this is clearly the second level. Im much more interested in level 3 and 4. We have had level 2 for oh.. 2000 years now. People are sick of level 2.

I truly was expecting more, the cast concidered. I am a long student of esoteric knowledge myself, but i was sort of hoping for some insights (new to me that is). I got one new angle from the entire series (already mentioned) - but it was more of a confirmation of what i already figured out myself - long ago.

Also, i presume (without sounding sexist) that a woman has been heavily involved in the making of this series. Nothing wrong with that, but for heaven sakes you have to ballance the material between male and female. Because right now it's utterly dominated by emotions and ""fairy land"" mentality (both sexes have this, so that was not targetet purely at women). But the material clearly carries the signature of a level 2 archetype  - and this sort of takes the edge of the entire project as far as I'm concerned.

Had i known, i would have spent my money getting the Magical Egypt collection instead. They really should stop gunning for the masses, because the wast majority is far more advanced these days, well, with some exceptions (fundamentalists) perhaps. Movies like ""the secret"" worked because the viewer was ""agressively put into a peacefull state of mind"". Not drowned to sleep with feelings and fairies.

They could at least had given 5 minutes to pythagoras and the density that comes with the ""fall"" of spirit (numbers) into matter (connected to the mentality of the archetypes) and mapped these to real world examples. Instead we get ""gaps"" in the movie with ladies walking in parks, gardens and such things.

It's worth watching, but i'm not sure you need to watch it more than once.",1254096000,2,2250,4.529556650246305
8308589,1,B001HC0T2Y,This one is no good.  Buy The Secret DVD or Joe Vitale's books instead - they are better than this stuff.,1246665600,3,105,4.0
