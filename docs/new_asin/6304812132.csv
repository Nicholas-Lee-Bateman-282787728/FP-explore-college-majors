937348,5,6304812132,"This movie was pretty interesting in my opinion. Overall, it had a nice plot, setting, but the only thing that i would comment on, is that the beginning of each show was a little bit slow, but it got going pretty  quick. This video is an excellent video in my opinion... except for little  kids because the content in this video is.. kind of.. adult like. It was  very humorous, and action packed. This was my first Tenchi video and i  already know that i am probably going to buy the rest of the series. Take  my advice and get it, it may be kinda short but very well worth it.",937612800,4,578,4.171171171171171

This volume talks about Washu and her past, plus it is very funny!!!  It also tells of Sasami's past.( for you Sasami fans out there!!) After you watch this movie, you will be crying and laughing at the same time! Have fun!!!!!",1019606400,,356,4.085714285714285

7878940,5,6304812132,"Tenchi Muyo is a classic in my eyes.  Almost every anime fan I know has seen it and I've yet to hear any negative comments.  With it's two seasons that involve the character's hilarious connections, interactions, and conflicts, it's twenty times better than Tenchi Universe.  I actually watched Universe first but when I got my hands on this I was amazed at hwo far Tenchi could go.  The show is filled with comedy, action, and drama.  By the way, definently watch the movies.  ;)",995241600,2,480,4.654761904761905
7878941,4,6304812132,"Tenchi Masaki, a young high scool boy who lives deep in the mountains unlocks a deamon! Overall, this volume is merely an introduction to the Tenchi Muyo series; Muyo in japanese actually meaning No Need For. So really after translation its No need for Tenchi! Basically though, these 2 episodes: Ryoko Resurrected, and Ayeka Attacks is an intro to the main caracters. Starting off with Tenchi and his grandfather, but he really doesnt play a role until later in Tenchi Universe. Also you get to meet as expected Ryoko the deamon that sleeps inside the cave, and Ayeka folloewd by Sasami, however, you get to meet Ryo-Ohki which is Ryoko's ""ship"". But all in all, this really isn't a very good volume unless your a collector, because nothing, unfortunatly goes on here. This video does provide, though, a nice beginning to the tenchi world and I at least appreciate it a whole bunch.",989280000,3,883,4.777777777777778
7878942,5,6304812132,"This is a very strange, yet completely enjoyable, anime. The characters are so great that I fell almost in love with them at once. Ryoko and Ayeka ""friendship"" is hilarious. This series will have you near tears one moment and off your seat laughing your head off the next. This is highly recommended by me, so what more information do you need? After this, you'll definatly have to check out the rest of this show(the other series). And remember, Washu is the greatest in the universe!!",970444800,7,486,4.662790697674419
7878943,5,6304812132,"This is a really cool video, although it only is one episode there are a  bunch of extra tenchi things.  I watch this video and the rest of the  collection over and over and it just gets funnier and funnier!!!!",965865600,2,210,4.2
