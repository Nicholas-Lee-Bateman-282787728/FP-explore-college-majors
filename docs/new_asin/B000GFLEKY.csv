2607038,5,B000GFLEKY,"I'm so pleased that this wonderful show will be available to enjoy again; I only saw a few episodes because our affiiate in Milwaukee bowed to the protests of a small few, and it was taken off. It's been a while, but I remember Aidan Quinn giving a fine interpretation of a conflicted man; a just and right and Christian man, facing issues that affect all of society. Also, a family man, with those profound concerns as an added challenge. As I recall, Jesus Christ had conversations with him, and this seemed to offend some closed-minded fundamentalist types. What I found intriguing was that we all like to think of our own clergymen as having some kind of connection to the Lord. Clergymen pray, and all this show portrayed was a clergyman's converations with the Lord, and his interpretation. Apparently, anyone who didn't appreciate ""The Book of Daniel"" are those who don't believe in prayer or their clergymen. Anyone who thinks that Jesus Christ isn't with us all the time shouldn't call himself a Christian. If the fundamentalists are offended by this show, then I'm offended by their idiot, closed-minded approach to spirituality. This show must have been especially interesting to the agnostics, if only for it's soft approach to a touchy subject matter. I write this with absolute respect to other religions, but encourage them to witness a well-written show, rife with humor as well as serious subject matter, to know that no one, even a clergyman, has all the answers, and that the Lord, whatever you may call him, is always there and it's comforting to know that we're not alone. We're also not alone with a brilliant cast and writing staff, that attempted to portray life and its foibles with aplomb and generous amounts of common sense. If you don't like it, don't watch it. How hard is that to understand...?  I particularly liked the idea that Jesus was portrayed with a sense of humor; the doom & gloom fundamentalists can stew in their virtue. Let the (majority) rest of us alone.",1157068800,81,2000,4.797101449275362
2607039,5,B000GFLEKY,"This show was unfortunately cancelled by the network after getting heat from religious conservatives who complained that it depicted a pill-popping minster who had conversations with Jesus.  They blindly chastised it without even seeing it, which is too bad because the show actually champions belief and how it gets people through their toughest times and weakest moments.  The show does not mock religion, Christianity, or Jesus, but instead deals with faith in a smart, touching, and dramatic way.  Too bad the network listened to the wrong people who didn't even care to inform themselves by actually sitting down and watching the show.",1156982400,19,640,5.254901960784314
2607040,5,B000GFLEKY,"Elated would be an understatement as to how I feel about this show being available for purchase on DVD.  This was THE only quality television show available to watch before it was cancelled (and we all know why...low ratings my %$#%@).  I urge EVERYONE to buy it and hopefully the interest will spark Showtime or HBO to pick it up and run with it!!  This show is not only funny, but warm, thought provoking, and incredibly acted by all the actors especially by Aidan Quinn.  BRAVO!!",1156809600,35,482,4.569767441860465
2607041,5,B000GFLEKY,I am so happy this is being released on DVD.  I wish HBO or Showtime would pick this up where NBC left off.  It is a shame it got cancelled because it shows humanity and that was too much for many to accept.  Great great series.,1156377600,21,228,3.9130434782608696
2607042,5,B000GFLEKY,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, HUMOROUS AND ORIGINAL STORY SITUATIONS I'VE EVER SEEN ON TV.  I WAS CRUSHED IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE AIR AFTER ONLY A FEW EPISODES, AS I THINK IT COULD REALLY HAVE PROMOTED SOME SELF-REFLECTION FOR ALL.  THE CONVERSATIONS THE REVEREND HAD WITH JESUS WERE SURELY THOUGHT PROVOKING AND FUNNY MOST OF THE TIME.  I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE ALL WISH WE COULD EXPERIENCE. AM THRILLED IT IS ON VIDEO AND WISH NEW EPISODES WOULD BE MADE.",1155859200,15,472,4.529411764705882
2607043,5,B000GFLEKY,"I loved this show - it depicted the human side of religion.  I was incredibly disappointed when the network pulled the plug on this show.  I don't know what the ratings were like, but I doubt they were low enough to merit a mid-season cancelation.  This well-done series deserves a second chance - I'd love to see it on a cable station.  Don't be bullied by the lobbyists!  I'm glad to see it's being released on DVD!",1154131200,77,417,4.363636363636363

2607076,5,B000GFLEKY,"I just loved this series why did they take it off.  If we had more family shows like this instead of vampires, ghosts, killings, drugs and
violence I'd watch more TV.",1394928000,,166,4.354838709677419
2607077,5,B000GFLEKY,Why did they cancel that book of Daniel? That is why I bought it and keep it. Love that series-movie.,1391904000,,101,4.1
2607078,5,B000GFLEKY,"My family absolutely loved this DVD!! It sparked emotions...happy, sad, laugh out loud! We can't believe this series was canceled, as it truly has potential to be top rated. Just look at the ratings it received here on Amazon! Aidan Quinn is wonderful, as is the entire cast! Thoroughly enjoyed watching this!!",1391558400,,310,4.980769230769231
2607079,5,B000GFLEKY,"and it was cancelled too quickly.  For those who are offended by the portrayal of an imperfect clergyman, I'm sure you don't watch TV shows that show crooked cops or politicians or that show people in other professions who fail to live up to their own standards.  As a Christian I was deeply annoyed that other Christians decided to take away my freedom to watch a TV show and decide for myself whether it was too thought provoking or not.  It makes us all look like closed minded idiots, just because a few people are offended by the idea of less than perfect clerygymen.  If you don't like the show, don't watch it.",1390780800,,617,4.433628318584071
2607080,5,B000GFLEKY,"I saw the original episodes that were aired on network TV & I knew, without a doubt, that complaints would cause this series to be cancelled. It was just too outrageous & irreverent! Sure enough, it died an early network death. But I never stopped hoping it would make its way to DVD, & my ongoing searches were rewarded. This is a series that should have played out its whole first season, but some people just can't stand to see the fun side of religion! I love it! The stories of human nature & human failings are funny, poignant, & very relevent to today's world in ways that were not in the headlines when the series first came out. I recommend it to anyone.",1390348800,,663,4.354838709677419
2607081,5,B000GFLEKY,"I imagine the ratings were just an excuse because this show is  brilliant.  The ensemble cast had a chemistry that is just so perfect and rare and the writing is incredible.  Not being Christian, I did try to view the topics and the talking to Jesus as if I were, so I could try and understand why so many were offended but I struck out there.  Aidan Quinn's acting was so natural, as was the rest of the cast that it just drew you into their world.  I might go as far to say that, all those years ago, when I was a young girl searching for divinity and faith, had any church been portrayed as kind and forgiving, as humble, human and accepting, Christianity would have been my choice, with no need to search further.  Unfortunately, in my experience, this show, with all of it's real life issues, falls so short of what being part of that faith entails. Not that I am not happy with my choice!  Because I truly am and my faith is the cornerstone of my life that keeps me going.  But it was a difficult road, overcoming stereo type and misconceptions, just so I could live my life and teach my children the same values, understanding and forgiveness that this show shows so well.  I think if more churches decided to take a page from the The Book of Daniel, there would be a lot more people filling the pews.",1386720000,,1308,4.284552845528455
2607082,5,B000GFLEKY,"This was one of those shows that almost lost me with the first episode.  But there was so much of an uproar from the conservative religious groups about it, I stuck with it just to see what had them all up in arms.  And it certainly kept getting better with each episode.

The acting was great across the board and the stories were well written.

It's worth it just for Alison Pill's cover of ""Time After Time.""

And of course, with any worthwhile TV series, it got chopped short.  In this instance, it was when the networks and everyone caved into the tiny minds who were having such fits. Too bad since it really was stretching itself into something great.",1386633600,5,658,4.441666666666666
2607093,1,B000GFLEKY,"My rating for this DVD is not based on the series.  I loved the series and was over the moon to finally see it on DVD for purchase. The reason for  the 1 star is because my copy of The Book of Daniel does not contain all of the episodes.  The DVD label which has not been altered indicates that the material on the DVD should be The Book of Daniel.  Instead, Disc 1 has a copy of Serial Mom and Nurse Betty and Disc 2 has the deleted scenes. Essentially I didn't get what I ordered. Unfortunately I am outside the return window. Fortunately I bought the DVD used so I didn't pay full price.  If you do order this DVD, immediately make sure the DVD actually has The Book of Daniel on it.",1385856000,,686,4.051851851851852
2607094,5,B000GFLEKY,"This series is unbelievable!  Such a presentation of events and situations many people face in real life, with excellent writing, directing, editing, and of course, prerformances, makes this a premier series.  I had seen the first episodes in the original airing, which was cut short due to pressure from advertisers, and had no idea of the other episodes in this collection.  It is Great!",1384560000,,389,5.046875

2607096,5,B000GFLEKY,"my hubby & I were disappointed when this show was cancelled after certain groups protested the premise without even seeing the actual show[s]. so I was delighted to find this & gift him with the series. great characters, lots of pertinent topics covered, in a respectful manner. just a few of the topics: homosexuality, marijuana, dementia, infidelity, birth control, personal responsibility & faith! we wish there were even more episodes, but what is there is well worth the time spent watching.",1377734400,4,496,5.135802469135802
2607097,5,B000GFLEKY,"Growing up as the son of an Episcopal clergyman in a great New England parish, I had but one perspective on clergy family life.  This powerfully gripped me and showed me so many other aspects of my parent's life that I had never considered or thought of - it drained away some of the anger I felt about growing up in that situation and makes me more understanding of the pressures of clergy families.  So well done.",1370390400,5,415,4.376623376623376
2607098,4,B000GFLEKY,"This has episodes 1,2, & 4 that aired on TV plus the un-aired episode 3.  Thought provoking, outrageous, hysterically funny!  As a Christian, I appreciate these wonderful, flawed characters, but too many people found it offensive.  Maybe--but it was fair!  Everybody got skewered sooner or later, and probably would have been redeemed if the show had been allowed to play out.  And Aidan Quinn has the prettiest eyes when he reminds his wife ""It's Friday!""",1369872000,2,456,5.026666666666666

2607100,5,B000GFLEKY,"The sarcasm in this TV series was wonderful. I was so very disappointed when it was canceled.  There were a lot of issues... gays, drugs, adultery, theft, the mob..... that this program touched on, and I found it to be deliciously funny. Too dang bad it was canceled.",1363392000,,267,4.5625

2607102,5,B000GFLEKY,We were disappointed when they took this off the air. This is a good comedy for adults. At least for those who see the series as a Comedy not a real life story.,1355184000,,160,3.878787878787879
2607103,3,B000GFLEKY,"I remember watching this on tv and was sad when it no longer aired. I ordered one earlier in the year and the 2nd disc was very distorted. Amazon was great in giving me a refund. I decided to order another hoping this would be fine. The 2nd disc was bad also but I had already thrown out the original package so I kept it.
This was a great price and looked factory sealed.",1338422400,,372,4.04054054054054
2607104,5,B000GFLEKY,"I loved this series. It lets us see the clergy as human beings. They have problems and family issues just like everyone else. And if you strip away all of the family problems, you are left with a priest who is a loving, caring man. This series gives us a peek inside the demanding life of a priest, from having to attend a socially mandatory golf outing to offering comfort to a family whose loved one is dying and counseling parishioners in crisis. I adored the portrayal of Jesus - he seemed to offer Father Daniel a realistic view of his actions with a bit of humor and some surprisingly insightful comments (I mean surprising for a television show - not for Jesus). It made me wish I had that Jesus at my side. I am so disappointed that this series didn't go longer.",1336521600,3,770,4.354166666666667
2607105,5,B000GFLEKY,"One of the funniest, but not politically correct, shows.  So sorry it was cancelled after so few shows.  We love it.",1330560000,,116,4.476190476190476
2607106,5,B000GFLEKY,"I agree with the others on here.  This was a great series that I was so sad to see go.  I know people that have been in similar situations as the characters in the series and was really really sad to see it end.  I am so glad i can now purchase this here on Amazon, I love this site.",1315008000,,283,3.683333333333333
2607107,4,B000GFLEKY,"It's a shame that narrow-minded protestors throttled this program in its infancy, as it is intelligent, quirky and thoroughly respectful in its handling of issues relating to Christianity. Although it was terminated with prejudice early on, the episodes on the DVD are well worth watching and provide many pleasures, if no definitive conclusion to the plot lines.",1304899200,2,363,5.385964912280702
2607108,5,B000GFLEKY,"I love this series because it shows human beings as humans not as 'gods' which we definitely are not.  Priests and ministers are not 'gods'  although many would like them to be.  I'm a Christian and all the foibles shown in this series are the reality of human life. To paraphrase what Father Webster said in one of his sermons, ""temptation is a reality, don't be so disturbed because you sometimes give in to it.  If you didn't then there would be no need for redemption! ""

If you cannot handle the fact no one is perfect except GOD  then the sooner you cross over the better.  Then all will see as we do not see now.  Great characters, great cast and more troubles than any one family should ever have to face.  Aidan Quinn is wonderful as Father Webster.",1299888000,,758,4.357142857142857

2607110,5,B000GFLEKY,"I am currently watching this as a class assignment in seminary, and I LOVE IT.  It's about real life in the parish, things that ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH REAL PEOPLE IN REAL CHURCHES.  I've just discovered this show, and apparantly it only made a few episodes before a bunch of rabid fundie Pharisees had it yanked.  I'm so mad about this.  It's just infuriating.  It's the best show I've ever seen, and I want it to continue.  Warning, if you watch this you may end up like me: delighted and pissed off at the same time.",1284768000,2,516,4.378947368421053
2607111,1,B000GFLEKY,"NBC should be ashamed of itself for presenting this junk. Oh, yes, liberals like to make fun of Christians. Some say it is a comedy and should not be taken seriously, just lighten up. Well, NBC would not think of doing a similar program about any other religion or group, not in this politically- correct era. NBC should be ashamed of even releasing this junk on DVD. I imagine they are at the bottom of the barrel.",1281657600,5,415,4.402597402597403
2607112,5,B000GFLEKY,"Many put ministers, pastor and clergy on a pedestal above everyone and set apart as model people for all to emulate.  This TV series displays a human and more approachable side of a priest.  A priest and his family are human with all of their flaws that make everyone so beautiful and so imperfect.

I really enjoyed this series because it was a very powerful portrayal of a family.

I understand that this was pulled off TV after the 3rd or 4th episode due to pressure from Christian right-wingers.  I am saddened by this because the episodes to follow provide a powerful insight into how all of these characters appear as dysfunctional and less than holy.

Daniel is the rock on which all rely on.  He sees and talks with Jesus for everything.  Shepherds need shepherds too!

Buy this series!  Watch it!  You'll see a very loving, close-knit and spiritual family unfold in front of you.  Love them for all of their shortcomings and know that priests are human too.",1271030400,4,966,4.617647058823529

2607124,3,B000GFLEKY,"I was expecting this to be like the VICAR OF DIBLEY from the UK.  That series was notorious for having some of the sharpest comedic actors playing eccentric villagers, where social life revolved around the church and their new vicar, Dawn French.  This show is a lot more somber than that.  It is pleasant and it tries to be both a comedy and a drama with Aidan Quinn as the reverend.  He is married, with children, adopted and biological, gay and straight.  Plus he has a father who is a bishop.  I think it is trying to be a little bit of everything, sort of a Jack of all trades.  Normally I like Aidan Quinn and I love Ellen Burstyn.  But this show just does not have the dramatic scripts and sharp conflicts they need in order to shine. As a series this just tries too hard.  I can't say it is terrible.  It is pleasant and a bit boring. There is one aspect I do not like at all.  Jesus appears to Aidan Quinn and they have conversations.  That is just too over the top for me.  I realize I am in a minority reviewing this show.  Most people like it.  Read some more reviews here if in doubt and maybe some others  can give you thoughts about why they do think it is worth your while.

2607125,5,B000GFLEKY,"This set has been on my shelf for a long time and I regret I did not watch it until this weekend.  The viewing was so rewarding that I feel compelled to sit down and share my appreciation with everyone, with the long-shot hope the series could be revived.  (Dust off the scripts, the actors are still young enough to resume their roles, with very little help from the make-up artists.)  I can't wait to see how the new material will deal with today's controversial topics.

What a marvelous gift to the world!  This series has (had) it all:  Substance dependency, end-of-life issues, disappearing church funds, adultery, teenage angst, pre-marital sex, racial bigotry, homophobia, a gay son, a gay mafioso, a bisexual sister-in-law, and more.  The series was about to get into teenage pregnancey and crooked politicians when it ended abruptly.  I was about to cry like a chick when twin brother Jimmy died in a flashback scene, and little sister's ""twinspiration"" poster almost clinched it.

I want to thank producer and actor in the title role Aiden Quinn for having brought this to the screen.  Giant man-hug to you, Aiden!  And thanks to Christian Campbell and Ivan Shaw who showed me what brotherly love could be, as my only brother died in infancy when I was very young.  This series also had my favorite Ellen Burstyn character ever.  The mom was a bit too heavy-handed against her son's first boyfriend, but she couldn't help it, she was written that way (too many martinis, maybe).

The graphics between the would-be commercials are excellent and gorgeous, simulating the look of stained glass windows.  All the production values were of the highest standards.  Why this series hasn't been pickup up by a cable network is beyond me.  The fact that this series was cancelled is a crime and living proof thar prudish little old ladies still rule the world, at least the networks.",1264896000,2,1885,4.822429906542056
2607126,5,B000GFLEKY,"This is a wonderful movie (quality and all) that has a beautiful message attached not to spoil the movie but once you have seen this it will become very clear what life is all about.

The writing, actors, and subject matters are great and I was surprised to find it a refreshing, clean drama--not like the sexed up, cursing ones you find today.  This show needs to come back on tv; it would be a much needed relief to all the crime shows and reality shows.",1248912000,,455,4.27906976744186

2607132,5,B000GFLEKY,I found this series very interesting and enjoyable.  It deals with things going on in everyday life.  I really got into the series and wanted to see more when the series ended after 8 or 9 episodes.  I know it was pulled off the air but I think this series should be re-introduced back into mainstream television because it would be helpful to a lot of people who are going through this stage in their lives whether it be young or old it will be an important part of your dvd collection.,1239753600,,487,4.271739130434782

Must have been, because I can see no other reason for cancellation.  I watched all seven episodes and really enjoyed all of them.  What a shame that we are left with cliffhangers that will never be resolved.

It's unfortunate that the protesting groups couldn't handle a very human and flawed priest, his wife's drinking, his son's homosexuality, the priest's conversations with Jesus, and whatever other elements were deemed too controversial.  A show that portrays religion in a positive light is such a rare creature, and it's pretty obvious that no such show will ever please enough people that they would leave it alone.",1212537600,5,740,4.92741935483871
2607145,5,B000GFLEKY,"Aidan Quinn is on my list of the top 10 actors performing on television in the 21st century - and I consider myself a critical person.  I still distinctly remember sitting in front of my TV set in my mid-20s, watching his shell-shocking star performance in ""An Early Frost"" in 1985.

Some twenty years later, here he is again - this time as the lead character in this riveting series that got cancelled after the airing of one episode.  Older, still looking great, still at the top of his game.

As Daniel Webster, an Episcopalian priest juggling quite a number of family concerns all at once, he again offers a true-to-life performance - the emotional center around which the entire series pivots.

While Aidan centers the show, the entire ensemble is equally outstanding.  About the only difficulty to swallow is the sheer amount of psychodrama incurred by these characters in the five jam-packed episodes on the DVD.  The production values are great, but it's the writing that's the other star of the show.  You don't have to be religious to enjoy this show - and if you are religious, you'll find it interest to see what our priest/protagonist encounters, and how he deals with the events, both individually and cumulatively.

I'd put the writing on a par with the best of ""Roseanne"" and ""Murphy Brown,"" and the best of ""The West Wing.""

A wise TV executive would pick up this series, gather these actors and actresses and writers back together, and give this series a good long run.  Is there any intelligent life out there?",1209427200,5,1529,4.7320754716981135

2607150,4,B000GFLEKY,"I should point out upfront that I am and have always been extremely spiritual. I am truly a God fearing man.

And in spite of this (or maybe because of it) I found 'The Book of Daniel' to be a lovely change of pace. It was nice to see a show in which the devoutly religious lead is a flawed everyman. He struggled with everyday issues -- a gay son, a drug abusing daughter, et cetera -- but at the end of the day it was apparent that Daniel was a caring, loving man.

The show's portrayal of Jesus flows against what many might be comfortable with, but I enjoyed it. He was funny, warm, and he comes across as shockingly human (of course to my mind, this interpretation of Jesus is wholly Daniel's -- I don't think the show means to insinuate that this is what Jesus is really like).

The show has been accused of deliberately trying to offend, but I agree with Reverend Susan Russell's examination of the show:

""How cool is it that a progressive Episcopal priest has a shot at being a prime-time drama protagonist. How surprising might it be to many who tune in to find out there actually is a church where women can be bishops - clergy can be human - and there's enough good news around to extend to everybody?""

However, the show proved to have more detractors than supporters in the religious community, and so NBC relented, dropping the show after only three episodes.

'The Book of Daniel' was a breath of fresh air. It's a shame they got cold feet when the heat was on, because I would have liked to see what direction the show would have gone in.",1197676800,11,1555,4.326460481099656
2607151,5,B000GFLEKY,". . . but at least we now have the DVD to cherish forever.  I'm actually quite surprised that they released this short-lived show on DVD--especially since most people have probably never even heard of it.

""The Book of Daniel"" is about a married priest (played by the wonderful Aidan Quinn, who anchors this show with a strong, solid performance) and his somewhat dysfunctional family and friends.  It's a soap opera--lots of plot twists and twisted plots--my kind of show.  I think the title may have kept people away from watching the show--maybe they thought it would be like that sappy ""Seventh Heaven"" series that ran forever.  Fortunately, it's not--it's sexy, very gay and the humor is dark and extremely funny.  It's also quite moving and realistic despite its soapy drama.  Such a shame that ""Daniel"" couldn't last for years.

I must mention the excellent cast: Susanna Thompson (as Daniel's beautiful wife), Christian Campbell (as his closeted gay son), Ivan Shaw (as his adopted son), Alison Pill (as his talented cartoonist daughter), Ellen Burstyn (as the Bishop with a juicy secret of her own), Cheryl White (as his flaky sister-in-law who has a lesbian affair) and Fran Bennett (as the family's feisty housekeeper).  They're all terrific, and it was a pleasure spending time with them.

The only downside to ""Daniel"" is that it ends with a number of cliffhangers that will never be resolved.  You will scream at your TV the following: ""NO! This can't be! Life is so unfair! Boo hoo!""  Sadly you will, but at least you can thank God that you were able to watch the seven episodes (2-hour pilot plus 6 hour-long shows) that were filmed.  ""The Book of Daniel"" is a damn good drama worth checking out.",1197244800,8,1712,4.821917808219178

The acting is a bit mediocre here and there, but it all pales in the face of a series that didn't shy away from real life.

2607165,5,B000GFLEKY,"I have a hard time understanding why some people (perhaps just the most vocal folks) have such issues with this series which depicts Christian people as real people with real problems and dilemmas who sometimes make bad (or at least unsaint-like) decisions.  As the son of a minister, I can attest to the fact that everything inside the minister's house isn't always sweetness and light.

Now this household is maybe just a little too packed with drama and back-story, but it is certainly entertaining, funny, touching, thoughtful, and respectful of its characters and also the church, with all it's worldly and unsaint-like concerns and influences.

Daniel is an Episcopal priest (and a good one, I think) who talks regularly with Jesus and pops pills to calm himself.  (If this much was going on in my life, I'd be tempted too.)  His wife is supportive and smart, and likes to drink. His oldest son is gay and suffering because of his identical twin's recent death.  His younger son is an adopted Chinese boy with a smart mouth and raging hormones.  His daughter is arrested for possession of pot in the opening scene.  There is more (lots more) and it's generally all pretty interesting and certainly worth a couple viewings to ""get"" it all.

I regret that I did not take interest in this series when it was airing and take the opportunity to voice my opinion that this was a series worth saving.  But what's done is done.  The DVD is worth seeing. Highly recommended.",1190332800,3,1471,4.751968503937008

Is it the one of Jesus comforting Daniel after he performed a reprehensible act due to his human failing?  Or is it the image of Jesus at all, asking questions, not providing the answers and certainly not adminishing, scolding, demanding, or punishing?  Is it the human diversity or the human foibles?

The show has great characters, great acting and great writers.  I am perplexed by the pundits that threw out so much venom against this show.  It portrayed Christians as real people with real problems trying to handle them in a real world.

Jesus is portrayed as caring, compassionate, there when he is needed. The scene where he is watching, in so much pain, during the beating is so powerful. What better testament could there be?

2607188,5,B000GFLEKY,"The Book of Daniel was one of the most poignant TV offerings of our

time. It was prematurely canceled due in large part to pressure from

the religious right.

Telling the story of an Episcopal priest and his family, it touches on

a full compliment of social issues as the family struggles with ""real""

life from a context of faith. If the viewer can keep in mind that while

it is unlikely, though not impossible, for one family to face all these

issues at the same time, there are are family's, both in and outside

the Church, that experience each of these issues...and often in

combination with others--then this show can change your life or at

least the way your view your life, faith, God and the Church in

general. Like real life, it tickles the funny bone, tugs at the heart

strings, and causes the brain to say ""hhmmmmm?"" Throughout the family's

struggles and joys Daniel, the priest speaks with Jesus...not just in

traditional prayer to the unseen deity, but Jesus actually appears to

Daniel... seated in the car next to him as he drives to and from

appointments...over his shoulder in the mirror as he prepares for

Sunday morning worship...even walking in the park. The character of

Jesus and his conversations with Daniel (apparently offensive to some

Christian mindsets) are at the heart of the show. It is here that

Daniel explores his own questions of faith (also offensive to some). It

is here that we see a true and real relationship between Jesus and one

of his ""flock."" It is here that we see the Jesus of the Bible...caring,

witty, smart, teacher, savior...at least the way I, a not-always-humble

(mainline denomination) pastor read and understand the Bible.

Watch this series! Give it chance! Let it work on your life! If it

angers you...ask ""why?"" If it moves you, beg for the creators to

continue the story. If you feel nothing...well...really ask ""why?"" I

love this show!!",1171670400,13,1919,4.750759878419453
2607189,5,B000GFLEKY,"It's a real shame ""The Book of Daniel"" didn't make it past the seventh episode.  It's probably one of the most addictive and even thought-provoking shows that has hit television in a long while.

It's sad that some conservative Christians objected to this show simply because it shows that people of faith are still completely human and not the sugar-sweet caricatures we find in shows like ""Seventh Heaven"".  It portrays clergy as imperfect, sure, but it also shows how dedicated they are, and how compassionate they can be, especially in the face of their own family problems.  It shows that politics and bureacracy- and yes, corruption- can be found in all layers of our humanity, including the church.  It talks about a church where gays and lesbians can be welcomed- oh horrors!

There are so many amazing things about this show that I don't even know where to begin.  The cast, for one, is incredible.  Aidan Quinn portrays the title character as a passionate priest who struggles with his church, his family, and himself.  Susanna Thompson plays his wife, and I have to say that the love between the two characters is amazingly believable. Ian Shaw and Christian Campbell do an excellent job as two brothers who, like all siblings, fight but still love each other.  Alison Pill takes a tough role- that of the rebellious drug dealing daughter- and manages to make it completely likeable and interesting.  The legendary Ellen Burstyn is delightful as a straight-talking bishop.

I don't watch very much television; I usually find most shows to be of little interest because I tend to relate  very little to the characters.  But ""The Book of Daniel"" has characters from all walks of life- I have a feeling most people will be able to see a little of themselves in this show.  The portrayal of Daniel's Alzheimer's stricken mother particularly hit home with me, and I am grateful that they managed to depict such a terrible and often misunderstood disease with such compassion and realism.

Some reviewers have complained that Jesus, with whom Daniel receives some advice and company, is too ""hippie-like"" and unhelpful.  I think that Jesus in this show is portrayed as a friend, someone that we can turn to in our worst moments.  We may not always receive a straight answer- Jesus in the Bible didn't give straight answers too often, by the way- but we can still unload our hurts and wants on him.  And that, to me, is exactly who Jesus is to me.",1170633600,6,2451,4.779097387173397
2607190,5,B000GFLEKY,"Like the much-admired & much-missed ""Nothing Sacred"" before it, ""The Book of Daniel"" was an intelligent attempt to look at religious life in contemporary society, with all the complexities & questions of that society. While it didn't attack faith -- Aiden Quinn's Daniel Webster is nothing if not devout & caring -- it did raise plenty of questions. And that's what did it in, of course.

It's a sad irony that those who claim to be true followers of any belief often seem to have the least amount of faith in it -- a single question, a single doubt, can bring the whole glittering but fragile structure tumbling down around their ears. So rather than take the risk of testing their faith, they choose to attack those who do ask the difficult questions. Unfortunately, it's not only a loss for them, it's a loss for the rest of us as well.

So it's a pleasure to see that all completed episodes of this promising series, including the unaired ones, are available on DVD. As previous reviewers have noted, you don't necessarily have to be a believer to enjoy the fine writing & acting offered here. Daniel's family could be many American families, religious or not, dealing with a world that runs at an increasingly faster pace, threatening to sweep us all up in its frantic rush forward -- to where?

That last question, ""to where?"", is the one that matters, the question that we all must ask ourselves. Shows like this one are an attempt to grapple with that question & all of its implications. What's it all about? Isn't there more to life than reality TV, endless & mindless consumption, a smirking fratboy attitude toward sex & everything else? Isn't there some deeper meaning to be found? How do we live in this imperfect & often confusing world? That's what ""The Book of Daniel"" tried to address, with warmth, humor, and plenty of smarts. Too bad so many frightened people weren't up to the test ...

In common with several other reviewers, I watched the DVDs in one sitting ending at 2:00 in the morning.  I was once again totally involved in the events of Daniel Webster's life and his relationship with Jesus.  It is a relationship that in someways reminded me of the relationship of the Vicar of Dibley with Jesus -- a relationship with both God and man.  Daniel talks to Jesus on an essential level voicing his frustrations, his questions.  It is a natural conversation as one would have with a beloved friend and teacher.  And, when Daniel is literally bowled over by some distressing news, Jesus is there behind him to keep him erect.  I cannot understand how anyone would have a problem with this loving relationship.

I do know that some of the topics explored homosexuality/homophobia, sexuality in general, medicinal marijuana and the like would be hot buttons to some.  But, I am dismayed and not a little angry that their prejudices should keep me and others from watching this series for many seasons.  I am most thankful for this DVD that has given me this excellent and well acted series to watch again and again.",1165795200,7,1279,4.64
2607209,5,B000GFLEKY,"And big time. I guess we as vierws are doom to wach tv series of things about law or sitcoms that play over and over the same joke or does pesky reality shows. Cause when a really good show like The Book Of Daniel comes on, so different from everthing else on tv, prodcuers, advertisers and, oh yes, stuck up religious people, they all star screaming ""dam does shows, dam does show to hell"".

Yes the show has different, yes it had Jesus as a regular character, yes it had controvery written all over it,  but so what? I mean do we really whant so keep on watching shows of crime scnes that have the same name only shot in different states? not me. i what someting fresh, something original, even if it means only one season and having it to buy on dvd.

The Book Of Daniel is a great show. A really good buy. You won't be disappointed.

Hopefully there is someone in there right mind and decides to pick up the show for another season. God hear me!!!",1165536000,6,951,4.237569060773481
2607210,4,B000GFLEKY,"What a wonderful joy to see ""The Book of Daniel"" again!  I had not realized how quickly attached I had become to the characters; it was like seeing old friends.  As one other reviewer noted, I too watched it all in one sitting.

Though the DVD contains only the seven episodes filmed prior to its getting the axe by NBC network execs due to protests from the Dominionistic-minded Christian Right, I am grateful for what there is.  I had hoped that the episodes might contain cast or director commentaries, maybe even scripts and a photo gallery.  Still, I am not complaining.  My only complaint is that some other cable giant (like HBO or Showtime) has not found the nerve to pick up on this wonderful portrait of a not-so-perfect Christian world and placed it into the safer environment of cable television. If ANYONE is listening, PLEASE bring this show back to us!!

Great DVD.  Great message!!  Definitely worth the bucks!",1161043200,18,926,4.7375
2607211,5,B000GFLEKY,I watched this dvd is one setting....I have often been told by my pastor to look for Jesus all around you....this series is the first to give me a glimpse into what he means when he says all around you. Bravo to all involved in this serie....I can only imagine where this show could have went....I hope the creator decide to write a book for those of us who want to know what happens to all the characters...then again isn't that kind of what religion is about...,1160956800,7,463,4.333333333333333
2607212,5,B000GFLEKY,"Honestly, the controversy surrounding this little TV epic was just to bigger than what it should have been. In essence this is a family drama and it just happens to involve the father being a minister and the fact that he happens to have sporradic conversations with Jesus. The other sub-plots... a daughter sellingg pot, a gay son, a son bedding a girl younger than him who comes from a family full of ""racist"" tension, a pill popping minister, a bishop who is engaged in an adulterous (yet, oddly enough... understandable...) affair. Some of the story arcs are never fully realised but there are others that get full on attention. for example, the daughters momentary slip into selling pot actually comes back later with a positive spin to it; it is a moment both humerous and heartbreaking.

This is a powerful, character driven mini-series. The fact that the church is even involved is really window dressing as the real meat of the program happens during the ""family"" time. Ever actor is solid in this and to single any out would be rather redundant. They all got their chance to shine in the episode ""God's Will"" as each got to explore different emotional moments with their characters. That episode is also a very powerful one... another tear jerker that has a (thankfully) 7th Heaven ending... well, kind of.

I am disapointed that the controversy killed the remaining episodes air time... but people are so thin skinned these days it is a wonder this show even got made. I am glad it did. It has been a joy to watch... both entertaining and insightful. ""The Book of Daniel"" is a book (err... TV show) solid enough to get into....",1160956800,10,1638,4.70383275261324
2607223,4,B000GFLEKY,"I don't see why the critics of this show were so adamant. After all, it's a realistic depiction of the challenges facing Episcopalian families in an overpriced suburb. Speaking from firsthand knowledge, there's very little distortion here!

Hard-core fundamentalists claim this is an unflattering depiction of a religious family and a clergyman. That doesn't mean it isn't accurate. I have traveled extensively in the red states and have encountered very godly people who are in extreme denial about the lives they are living. At least (some of) the Websters are trying to face their problems, and learn from their mistakes.

I found this series to be compelling, funny, and, at parts, very moving. Far better than most of the ridiculous stuff you see on TV. Everyone in the ensemble clicks beautifully. You laugh and cry with them. There's very little didacticism, and unlike most quality dramas, the writers don't preach out of the mouths of the various characters. (Are you listening, Nip/Tuck?)

It's a terrible shame that this show didn't go for at least one season. Seven episodes leave you hanging. Definitely worth seeing nevertheless.",1160697600,9,1143,5.167567567567567
2607224,5,B000GFLEKY,"I'm so sorry this show was done in by the far right.  It really was a well written, marvelously acted show.  I would have loved to see where it would have gone had the small minded not decided that since they did not like it, so no one should be allowed to see it.  It was a reflection of real life and not the delusional state of grace that most feel that they inhabit.  I really think that it could have grown into a successful show, but the ratings must not have been up there- for what, the 3 episodes that did manage to make it on the air? Too bad, it really was something special.",1160524800,6,586,4.025862068965517
2607225,5,B000GFLEKY,"As a Christian in the Episcopalian tradition, I was one of the many viewers who became immediately hooked by this well-written, beautifully-acted, intelligent show.  And I was tremendously disappointed when, bowing to pressure from the religious Right (who seem to think they have the exclusive rights to Jesus), the network pulled it after airing only a few episodes.

Now, having seen the full ""first"" season on DVD, I'm even more saddened at the network's caving in to the forces of intolerance.  Because the show just gets better and better with each episode: more powerful, more heart-wrenching, more deeply reflective about real issues of faith lived in the context of actual life.  The penultimate episode, ""God's Will,"" is one of the most extraordinary and moving episodes of television series drama I've ever seen.

Aiden Quinn, Susannah Thompson and Ellen Burstyn all give remarkable, Emmy-deserving performances.  The writing is sharp and, in many instances, hilarious.

Like others, I don't understand why HBO or Showtime hasn't picked up this marvelous series and continued it.  I'm ready for more!",1160179200,16,1111,5.308571428571429
2607226,5,B000GFLEKY,"This is a wonderful programme, and the DVD gives us the chance to see it all (even episodes and scenes skipped over in the all-too-short network run.) From a light hearted beginning -- a tongue in cheek portrayal of Episcopalian Christianity -- the series moves into some heart wrenching, very difficult and entirely human situations. Complicated folk (no plaster saints here) wadding through the high waters of life from the place of faith and Christian community.

As a person in a modern, diverse, scientifically-informed world, and as a practicing Episcoplian, I have no trouble with so called ""moral relativism"", multi-culturalism, evolution, etc.  These things make the world more interesting and exciting, and I'm energized by the challenge of having to define my spiritual proclivities, ethics, and morals in a thinking, reasoned manner.  I therefore have no trouble with this show and instead find it an interesting and compelling look at the sorts of conflicts and doubts that will soon or later plague every person of faith, whether they like or not.  Good story lines and fantastic acting talent make this a series worth watching again and again, whether you practice a religious faith or not.",1159401600,28,864,5.1063829787234045
2607229,1,B000GFLEKY,"Our local station showed a couple of episodes of Daniel both of which I watched in spite of many of our local churches objecting to the show (some of us DO think for ourselves!). Perhaps an explanation is in order for those who don't understand conservative Christianity. The fact that Daniel ""popped pills and talked to Jesus"" was not even an issue. I believe the biggest objection from a Christian perspective was the typical in-your-face homosexuality, adultery, and other secular viewpoints as being so ""normal"" that even a priest/pastor considers it normal, a very skewed depiction of religious ministers...plus the fact that it was being aired at primetime on local networks. Conservative Christians aren't perfect, but many of us do hold our clergy to a higher standard. We don't expect that our pastors will have one foot in the world and the other in church. While many view us as the minority, in actuality we are the majority who aren't willing to remain silent on these issues any longer for the sake of our children and grandchildren (remember how many red states there were in 2000 and 2004?....a big change since 1996). All that being said, I personally wish Jesus WOULD appear and talk to me. I'd have a million questions to ask Him.",1159315200,18,1249,4.841121495327103
2607230,5,B000GFLEKY,"This show was simply the best show on TV in years. In a world at war, it let us escape to a world of believers, fun and good ol' Christianity!

I've been a Christian for over 20 years and very few shows have had the impact that this show has had in the ""religious"" field. 7th Heaven, Joan of Arcadia, Touched By An Angel are a few of the quality shows that are among these. It's well written, original and had a great sense of family.

It showed the flaws that we all have and how we should each turn to Christ to help overcome them.

How anyone can call themselves a true Christian and wanted this show off the air....well....they really aren't. Anyone who caved to this lunacy are nothing but cowards.

It amazes me how people got upset over Daniel talking to Jesus. Isn't that what we, as Christians do on a daily basis? Call me crazy but that's what I do!

Who knows.....maybe we'll see more ""Daniel"" in the future. But for now I'll make do with what we've got now.

The acting featured superb performances by Aidan Quinn, Ellen Burstyn, and Susannah Thompson (who should have received an Emmy).  This was a rare show that made you eager to see the next episode.

8131307,5,B000GFLEKY,"A hit with the critics but scary to NBC, THE BOOK OF DANIEL (2006) had its plug pulled after a mere four of its eight episodes had aired. And that's a pity, because it has a great cast (including Aidan Quinn as Father Daniel Webster, the put-upon head of family and Episcopal Priest), Ellen Burstyn (his boss, the Bishop), and Garret Dillahunt as Jesus, who sometimes speaks to Father Webster and chides him for his overuse of painkillers.  The good Father has plenty of other problems, too:  even in the first episode he learns that this brother-in-law has embezzled more than three million dollars from the church he pastors, and his willful daughter is kept overnight by the police for selling pot -- not to mention that one son is a major womanizer and the other one's gay. What a shame that the network, having had the guts to mount this dry comedy, panicked prematurely. I don't know if THE BOOK OF DANIEL was ever cut out for a mass audience, but it deserved an audience. This DVD includes all eight episodes, four of which were aired, four weren't, but all are on display here at a good price.",1508112000,,1101,4.527638190954774
