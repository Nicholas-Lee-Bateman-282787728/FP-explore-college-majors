8665034,4,B00LBMWB1M,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of Madama Butterfly with Mirella Freni, Placido Domingo and Christa Ludwig. FYI - Disregard Amazon's warning that this is a region B/2 Blu-ray and will not play on USA Blu-ray machines. I purchased mine from Amazon merchant ""MovieMars"" and received a ""All region"" NTSC Blu-ray (just as pictured) and it played perfectly on my USA Panasonic DMP-BP30K Blu-ray player from 2008.

This production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle is mostly very good with one caveat, which I'll get to later. This is one of the most moving and beautiful performances of Madama Butterfly on video. Mirella Freni, Placido Domingo and Christa Ludwig are superb and in top voice here. This comes from the Jean-Pierre Ponnelle film from 1974. The lip syncing is generally very good. Domingo is fairly young and believable in his part here at 33 years old when he recorded it. Butterfly is suppose to be 15 years old but it would be very difficult to find a soprano that can perform this part that looks 15 years old. Freni was 39 when she made this but still looks like she is in her 20s and what a superb voice. Their acting is suburb and not over the top. The filming uses some special effects such as slow motion and dream sequence tastefully. However, there is a caveat. The last minute of the opera was disappointing to me. In this opera Puccini requires Butterfly to commit suicide alone. But in this production Pinkerton arrives to see Butterfly commit suicide right in front of him. Pinkerton arrives about 5 seconds before Butterfly commits suicide as they face each other about 15 feet away. She and Pinkerton are looking right at each other for several seconds and then she does it. This implies that she commits suicide, mostly, out of revenge against Pinkerton which is not how this story is suppose to play out, nor is it what Puccini intended. Pinkerton is not suppose to witness Butterfly's suicide, he is suppose to arrive after she does it. Also, Butterfly is suppose to commit suicide because she has lost both loves of her life, her husband and her son, and also out of honor, but not at all out of revenge. I think that is wrong. I really hate it when directors take creative license and change the intended story. Also, after the suicide Placido runs through the wall and the film is stopped with a picture of him in the middle of jumping through the paper wall, not a good choice either as it left me unsatisfied and incomplete. He should have held Butterfly in his arms! That would have been much more moving. If you can get past the ending, than this is well worth watching, as there are many beautifully visual and musical moments in this version.

The picture quality transfer of the 35mm film is very good. It's source is the original 35mm 4:3 aspect format film from 1974. The re-mastered 5.0 DTS-HD sound quality is excellent as is the 2 channel PCM stereo. The original sound source is of the 1974 analog master recorded before the filming. If Jean-Pierre Ponnelle had stuck to the original ending, I would have given this a 5 star rating, but instead I have to take away 1 star and give 4 stars because of the changed ending and Placido jumping through the rice paper wall at the end and then sudden freeze frame in the middle of jumping through. The rest of the opera that came before is quite good and worth getting this version.",1427932800,10,3368,4.602329450915142
