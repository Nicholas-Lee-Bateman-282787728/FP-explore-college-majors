7850173,5,6303521371,"I bought this VHS tape (yes my VCR stills works) because I'm a big fan of Betty Grable, who guest stars on this episode. Incredibly funny episode where Lucy wins a race horse for Little Ricky by entering cereal box tops in a contest. Of course, Ricky doesn't want her to enter the contest and that's when all the comedy starts. If only television was like this now days...",1446076800,,372,4.405797101449275

Even better, Lucy joins Red in a Freddie the Freeloader skit.  Not since Harpo Marx showed up on ""I Love Lucy"" have we had such a great opportunity to smile at the anticipation of how delightful any scene putting these two comic geniuses together would have to be, and in this regard we are not at all disappointed.
The premise is that Ricky is taking the band to Nome, Alaska, to appear on a Red Skelton television special celebrating the admission of Alaska as the 49th state.  The Ricardos and Mertzes head north together, and Ricky and Fred are excited about some land they have purchased, sight unseen.  Of course, it looks exactly like a frozen wasteland, but the really bad news is that the hotel accommodations force the two couples to share one room, where they draw lots for the one small bed, an army cot, a sleeping bad, and a hammock.  If you do not know which one of those four Lucy gets, then you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Meanwhile, the actress who was supposed to appear with Red in his sketch cannot make it to Alaska and Lucy volunteers to take her place.  However, before we can get to the best part of the episode, Lucy has to drag Red out to see Ricky and Fred's property so the two can be stuck flying a small airplane by themselves.
The Freddie the Freeloader sketch is enough to justify picking up this show, which first aired on February 9, 1959, but there are a couple of other above-average bits as well.  The idea of these hour-long episodes was that the Ricardos and Mertzes would travel to exotic locations, but obviously what made these work was who was the guest star, and having Red Skelton is a biggie.  Pay attention to the two Eskimos, because one of them is played by Iron Eye Cody, who would become a major pop culture footnote as the crying Native American in those memorable anti-pollution public service ads.",1071360000,4,2026,4.5136612021857925
7850177,4,6303521371,"If you are an I Love Lucy fan, you'll love this ... and if you also happen to be a Betty Grable fan - you've won a watch! Or should that be horse?
When Lucy wins a racehorse for her son, she has problems with  husband Desi about keeping it. Betty Grable solves the problem by  encouraging Lucy to enter it in a race. Of course, it wins after Lucy  steers it in every direction until she eventually passes the winning-post -  practically on her knees!
Betty Grable, looking very glamorous and still  showing a great pair of legs, gets to dance the Bayamo. It is just a pity  she hadn't a better dance partner than Desi Arnaz, who seems to bring the  normally fast-moving Grable to a canter! Good fun.",938131200,6,699,4.290076335877862
7850178,5,6303521371,"This is a very clever episode of I Love Lucy. She can actually sing in this one. I loved the hammock scene, but the ""dinner"" scene, where everything is being mimed, is the best part. It deserves every star I  gave it.",937612800,3,217,4.166666666666667
