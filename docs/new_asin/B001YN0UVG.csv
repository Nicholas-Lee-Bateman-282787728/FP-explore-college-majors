8348122,5,B001YN0UVG,This was a gift for my grandson for Christmas. He called me and said he loved it. He has watched Bill Dance for years.,1392422400,,118,3.9583333333333335
8348123,5,B001YN0UVG,"This was a gift for my grandfather and although many folks didn't rank this highly, the laughter I shared with him concerning the mishaps with fishing are priceless",1375056000,,164,4.892857142857143
8348124,3,B001YN0UVG,"I didn't find this DVD all that bad as others have said. It's just my opinion.

It has most of the real bloopers that you can find on YouTube for free and a bunch of clips from older shows where he does some corny acting with Mel Tillis and numerous other quasi famous friends and actors, singers, shooting experts, sports players, etc.

Of course the acted out stuff is fake, like the guy on the bridge, shooting the bobber, etc. If you've ever watched enough Bill Dance fishing shows you'd know he does this stuff often. They have corny acting and gags done on the show on purpose. He used to do them all the time in the 80s and 90s. It isn't meant to be taken serious or as a real blooper.

After watching it all, you'll get about 60% real bloopers from the show, 40% gags and fake bloopers he did on his show on purpose for entertainment between segments.

The annoying part is the fake sound effects (zing, pop, bang and such) added to the bloopers. Now those aren't needed and shows in the low quality production being done in house for the videos.

This DVD also includes all the scenes from the previous four volumes in the bonus section.

For $7 used, it was a great deal for my fishing DVD collection.

Would I pay $25 or more for a new one?  No way. Find it used and enjoy the Bill Dance we all like.",1331337600,,1311,4.236947791164659
8348125,1,B001YN0UVG,"I have seen previous Bill Dance Bloopers and laughed myself silly. Too bad I cant say the same for this volume. Its boasts a 3 hr running time, but out of the total 3 hrs, there is probably about 15 mins of Bloopers/goofups. Most of this video is like an old time comedy acting routine between him and friends that wasn't even funny, it was just plain stupid. Even some of the bloopers looked fake, particularly an incident with a mustard bottle. You can see him holding the lid on with a finger...then slipping the finger off and ""oops"" the lid came off.  Imagine that???? Very very cheesy, what a let down and a supreme waste of money. I had more fun clipping my toenails than I did watching this video.",1325980800,,705,4.3816793893129775
