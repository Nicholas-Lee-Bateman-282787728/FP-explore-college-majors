2995753,2,B000X1HA4U,"I generally enjoy ""north of the border"" movies and am generally generous with my stars.  The antagonist has potential as an actor so keep going fella.  The movie started well and had a good story going for the most part.  For me, it all took a nose dive during that last third of the movie and never recovered.  It wasn't insulting so give it a rainy day watch and post your comments to calibrate mine one way or another...",1352246400,7,423,4.3164556962025316

2995776,3,B000X1HA4U,"It was a fairly decent movie and rather predictable. It wasn't that far into it when I suspected it was made-for-TV. The bad guy was definitely too bad of a bad guy for a guy in such a lofty position within his family business, though, and he had almost cartoonish qualities. Was he the black sheep cousin or something? For a lying-in-bed-and-trying-to-fall-asleep-type, it served its purpose well. It took me several nights to finish and I probably only did it because of the lead actress, who is Natalie Wood's/Robert Wagner's daughter. She's a real sweetheart, and if it makes me sound sexist, I don't mean it that way, but you can take it any way you want. She's wholesome and played a nice girl placed in a bad situation. Initially naive, she managed to sort things out, but someone else had to save the night.",1472774400,,815,4.627586206896551
2995777,2,B000X1HA4U,"It is an ok movie. The acting was kind of flat and this might have been a low budget movie. It was from the '90's, I think. The role of the killer was very lame and pathetic even though he was a killer.",1471824000,,202,3.7209302325581395
2995778,3,B000X1HA4U,"The acting was poor. The girl was not believable. Did not feel the chemistry between her and the fiance. It is predictable plot from the start to the end.

2995799,4,B000X1HA4U,She was a very likable person and the killer was really scummy. He says I'm not a killer and I deserve this. He killed 2 innocent people and got what he deserved. I liked the ending after seeing how he killed the 2 people.,1458691200,,222,4.068181818181818

2995810,2,B000X1HA4U,"Reeeeaaaalllly bad. The production quality is abysmal. The acting is truly subpar. The soundtrack is a joke. It seemed almost like a high school play filmed on a cell phone with the high-school band percussion-section banging on things here and there, except the actors were far too old for high school. Maybe they were held back? Yikes. I think with a good director, a good budget, good acting, good editing, good cinematography and a good soundtrack there could have been an OK movie-of-the-week story in there somewhere, but the script is terrible, too. It really is one step up from being bad enough to be funny-bad.",1442275200,,620,4.8584905660377355

2995815,2,B000X1HA4U,"The story is interesting.  Mr Graham had probably the best acting skills.  Unfortunately Natasha was either not yet skilled enough when this film was done or she just did not inherit her Mommy's talent.  Her irritatingly wooden recitation of lines was made worse by a lame tangent storyline intended to set viewers up with a previous experience of the character that made her easily terrified. (Spoiler info ahead) Then at the end we see her skitter around running away from the killer and we have to pretend we believe she can't be seen in a slightly darkened cellar.  That whole segment when the bad guy was chasing her was good for one purpose- time to go grab a bowl of popcorn, check emails and still be back in time to watch credits roll after a most predictable end.",1434153600,,773,4.579710144927536

The bad guy was definitely too bad of a bad guy for a guy in such a lofty position within his family business, though, and he had almost cartoonish qualities. Was he the black sheep cousin or something? For a lying-in-bed-and-trying-to-fall-asleep-type, it served its purpose well. It took me several nights to finish and I probably only did it because of the lead actress, who is Natalie Wood's/Robert Wagner's daughter. She's a real sweetheart, and if it makes me sound sexist, I don't mean it that way, but you can take it any way you want. She's wholesome and played a nice girl placed in a bad situation.
