1734226,5,B000069HZC,"COPACABANA was made back in 1985 for ABC pictures and Dick Clark's production company. Dick approached the thwen famous Barry Manilow about his song Copacabana and actually making a story about it for the small screen. It works very well and has a bitter sweet quality to it. It stars Barry Manilow himself with Annette O'Toole (now on the WB's Smallville).
Directed by Warren Hussen, it tells the story of two aspiring performances meeting at a radio competition and then finding out they have much more than music in common. They strive to be who they are. Tony Star (Manilow) an aspiring writer and performer and Lola Lamar (O'Toole) a singer dance who's on;y dream is to perform at the Copacabana.
Along the way the evil Rico - and owner of another club in Havana tried to steel mis Lamar away. She finds who she really love is Tony and in the end - well. You'll have to listen to Barry's song and you'll know what happens.
The movie is tastefully done and Barry although not a great actor - pulls it off well. Annette is very good and broad in her performance. Other cast members include Estelle Getty, James Callahan and Joeseph Balogna. There are not many extra's, but the movie is still entertaining. A family film. P.S. See my other Manilow Music Reviews and I have seen him 19 times in Person on tour!(8-15-02)",1029542400,6,1320,4.5974576271186445
1734227,5,B000069HZC,"I HAVE BEEN A BARRY MANILOW FAN FROM THE FIRST SONG HE CAME OUT WITH.  HIS MUSIC TUGS AT YOUR HEART AND MAKES YOU WANT TO SMILE, DANCE, AND CRY ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  WHEN THIS MOVIE CAME OUT, I RECORDED IT BECAUSE I NEW IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL, WHICH IT WAS.  WELL, SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY RECORDED OVER IT BY MISTAKE NOT LONG AFTER IT AIRED, AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT EVER SINCE.  MY FAVORITE SONG IN THE MOVIE IS ""WHO NEEDS TO DREAM"".  WHEN HE SINGS THAT SONG IN THE STREET, IT GAVE ME BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH.  I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THE SONG, BUT COULDN'T FIND IT ON ANY OF HIS ALBUMS.  MY BROTHER FOUND IT ON THE INTERNET NOT LONG AGO, AND DOWNLOADED IT ON MY COMPUTER.  NOW WHEN I WORK ON MY COMPUTER, I CAN LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIM.  MY MOTHER WHO IS 77 YEARS OLD ALSO LOVES BARRY, AND LOVES THIS MOVIE.  SHE IS ALWAYS BRINGING IT UP AND SAYING HOW MUCH SHE WANTS TO SEE IT AGAIN.  WELL, I ALSO BOUGHT THE VHS VERSION FOR HER 78TH BIRTHDAY WHICH IS IN AUGUST.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW I FOUND IT.  SHE WILL BE SO SURPRISED!  I REALLY HOPE I GET IT IN TIME FOR HER BIRTHDAY WHICH IS AUGUST 24TH.  I JUST WENT TO HIS CONCERT HERE IN ARIZONA, AND HE JUST GETS BETTER WITH TIME.  I LOVE HIM, THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR RELEASING THIS BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.  IT WILL BRING JOY TO MANY!  ANNE FROM AVONDALE ARIZONA.",1026172800,9,1373,3.9779411764705883

1734269,5,B000069HZC,"This is definitely the most expensive DVD I own, but it is worth every single penny! I have just about every Barry DVD, CD and record and I knew that my collection wouldn't be complete without his only full-length movie acting role! Copacabana has music, passion and all the Barry magic a girl could ask for! The script is charming, the casting is impeccable, the music is contagious and Barry is simply irresistible!",1366675200,,417,4.726027397260274

1734271,4,B000069HZC,The DVD arrived in great condition and within the timeframe specified. We watched the DVD and got into the spirit of Copacabana!!,1325980800,,129,4.909090909090909
1734272,5,B000069HZC,"I just received and watched a very expensive copy of this movie.  (Wish I had taped it back in the 80's....)  I had been thinking about it since watching the last episode of Smallville, since Annette O'Toole is in both.

Yep, it is as good as I remembered.  And I'm not a Manilow fan, at least music-wise, although I've always admired his attitude.

After seeing this movie again, maybe I should be a fan - I had remembered most of the songs pretty well from one single hearing in 1985.  ""Man Wanted"" had made a particular impression on me - Annette O'Toole doing that song (in both versions) is one of the most amusing things I've ever seen!

And Manilow actually turns in a pretty good acting job.  No, that sounds condescending.  He was very good, period.  Absolutely believable and adorable.

Too bad this is not still in print, so people didn't have to shell out so much to see it.",1306022400,,886,4.440993788819876

1734274,5,B000069HZC,"Copacabana is a great movie. If you like 1940 type musicals with a lot of singing and dancing, you'll love this movie. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. The song and dance production numbers are done so well. Who Needs to Dream and Sweet Heaven I'm In Love Again are two of the best musical numbers I've seen. If you're not already in love with Barry you will be after you see Who Needs To Dream.  This is a must for any Barry Manilow fan. Barry never ceases to amaze me with his talent. You will not be disappointed with this DVD.",1245974400,,559,4.081818181818182
1734275,2,B000069HZC,"It was with great excitement that I bought this DVD and couldn't wait to sit down and watch. Twenty minutes into it I thought to myself, ""just give it time, I'm sure it'll pick up!!"" Well I was thinking that all the way to the credits!! If you want the stage show, then this is not the one to get. But if it's glorious 80's kitch and some nice Manilow tunes thrown into a rather tedious story, mediocre acting and singing that you want, well then this will hit the spot! Not a great DVD, but a nice souvenir of a past era!",1174262400,,522,4.077669902912621
1734276,5,B000069HZC,"Re-write Jan. 2009

I just watched this DVD again and I must apologize.  Although I previously gave it 5 stars, my first review just did not do Copacabana justice, so I had to rewrite it.  Maybe I was having an off-day the first time I watched it because when I watched it a second time, all the love just spilled out all over the floor.  What an absolutely beautiful moving story and movie! I found myself falling in love with Lola (Annette O'Toole) and Tony  (Barry Manilow) while I watched them fall in love with each other.

The movie opens, as the song says, with the Copa, now a disco.  An aged, broken, and drunken Lola sits at the bar with her troubles buried in the bottom of her glass.  She looks toward the dance floor and gets a vision of her love, Tony, playing piano and smiling at her.  It was so sad, I could feel the pain in her eyes and heart.  You know the storyline already because it follows the ever popular Copacabana lyrics (Tony and Lola fall in love; he gets killed by Rico; Lola is alone, grieving, for the rest of her life.)  In between, you can enjoy the beautiful songs, and the lavish costumes and scenery.  The movie again ended with Lola's beautiful vision of Tony, and it left me in tears.

Barry does a great job throughout the movie singing, dancing, playing the piano, and even the accordion--and acting!  And don't forget, MUSIC BY MANILOW--he arranged the songs and he wrote most of these songs, too!  How talented and versatile he is and has always been!  Geeze!  When you watch him in the scenes, the look in his eyes is so pure--so like a young man full of love and hope and dreams of the future.  He certainly loves his music because the passion shows big time. And I love the scene where he sings ""Sweet Heaven"" at the Copa in a white tux.

Annette does such a great job as Lola, too.  In her case, she sings, dances and acts and is superb!  Let's not forget Joe Bologna as smarmy (I love that word) Havana nightclub owner, Rico, and a cast of other fine actors who certainly add to the movie.  Of course, the colors of the glamorous costumes and sets are great. Oh, and Barry (age 42-ish) is so cute and Annette is gorgeous.

By the way, to those recent articles cracking Barry about being thin--he was always thin and you can see he was thin in this DVD--so P-t-t-t-t-h!

There are 22 scene selections in this wonderful 95 minute musical, produced in 1985 by Dick Clark Cinema Productions, Inc./Stiletto, LTD--Executive Producer: Dick Clark.  What a fine movie. I won't wait so long to watch it again. As a matter of fact, I think I will put it on again as we speak.  All I can say is, ""Sweet Heaven, I'm in Love, AGAIN!""",1164499200,6,3325,4.36260162601626
1734277,5,B000069HZC,"This movie reminded me of the reason I used to go to movies...to be entertained!  It was cute, camp, clean, and captivating.  I was blown away by the creative way in which the song ""Copacabana"" was used as the starting point to tell a great story with an unfortunately tragic end.  Barry Manilow demonstrated that he is a true artist who can do it all; in this movie he is as believable as he is lovable in the role of Tony.  For Fanilows like me this movie is a MUST SEE/MUST HAVE for your collection; for everyone else it's just plain great.",1156118400,,543,4.294117647058823
1734298,5,B000069HZC,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. If your goal is to be entertained, this is it. Music, dancing, and the acting ain't bad, either. Barry Manilow has a boyish charm and exuberance that is really quite infectious, and Annette O'Toole is quite good in this role. Copacabana is good, old-fashioned clean fun.",1131926400,,312,4.90566037735849
1734299,5,B000069HZC,This is a great musical and timeless story. Annette O'Toole was wonderful as was Barry Manilow. The soundtrack is a must have for music fans. I have been a Manilow fan since Mandy and Its a Miracle. This movie is definately worth watching. I highly recommend it.,1127347200,,262,4.595744680851064
1734300,4,B000069HZC,"Both Barry Manilow and Annette O'Toole do a wonderful acting job. The music is, of course, incredible. The video quality of the DVD is not as great as I would have expected but it's still good.

1734301,5,B000069HZC,"I have wanted this movie for oh so many years!!! Ever since I first saw it on television. I love all the songs! It a cutesy movie with a thin plot, but the music is what Barry is known for and it will have you humming along!  I wish there would have been some special features on this DVd version....it is pretty bare, but after waiting all these years, I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!! Buy this one, you won't regret it!",1052006400,7,415,4.060975609756097
1734302,5,B000069HZC,"Every Barry fan should have this movie with their fan collection & memorabilia! Barry gave a wonderful performance in this movie as ""Tony Starr"". I enjoyed his sense of humor when Barry(""Tony"")said, ""Riley, Stern, & Starr ... sounds like a lawfirm"" - haha!
It's a wonderful movie but I have to admit that I avoid watching
the ending of this movie cause it's terribly sad. I only go as far watching the movie of the part when Tony rescues Lola, takes her back to New York with him & marries her. After the wedding scene, I don't watch the rest of the movie cause Rico should've been the one to have gotten killed by that gunshot, not Tony!!",1050192000,6,639,4.423728813559322
1734303,4,B000069HZC,"I have long enjoyed this fun musical ever since it was first broadcast on CBS way back in December '85.  It is a throwback to the early days of the MGM movie musicals, complete with great songs, a paper thin plot, and truly enjoyable characters.  Barry Manilow has received a lot of flack for his one and only outing as an actor, but I found his performance genuine and just as over the top as his live concert performances.  Manilow has always been a master showman, kind of like a favorite uncle.  I give this 4 out of 5 stars because I found myself very disappointed with this DVD release.  If Mr. Manilow can sit through a 2-hr. concert of his and provide audio commentary, would it really be that hard to do it for this enjoyable 90-minute musical romp?  What about the other actors or the director?  How about an introduction by Dick Clark, TV commercials, a 5 to 10 minute retrospective interview with Barry?  This release is cheap and could have been so much more, though it is simply nice to have it on DVD.  [...]!)  Be prepared for a disc as bare-bones as they come.  There is not even a main menu (gasp!)  The only menu availabe is the scene selections.  Copacabana deserves more, much more.",1035417600,6,1203,4.438356164383562
1734304,4,B000069HZC,"Imagine if you will, an old 20th Century Fox musical; one starring, say, John Payne, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche wherein 2 young performers fall in love, seek stardom, have a falling out, but finally get together for a happy ending. All accompanied by a typical, i.e. better-than-average but just short of memorable, song score. Then, at the end, Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" enters and utters ""Say Hallo to my li'l fren'"" That's this film (and, no, I'm not giving anything away, that's the song,too!)
Add to this a script by JAMES LIPTON! Yes, ""Actor's Studio"" James Lipton!(Is ""Manilow"" his least or most favorite word?)and you've got a unique treat.",1030838400,,646,4.881818181818182
1734305,4,B000069HZC,"Barry isn't quite as stellar an actor as he is a singer, but it doesn't matter.  I smiled the entire way through this movie.

1734307,5,B000069HZC,"This movie is great. This movie was broadcast on CBS originally in December 1985.  Barry,Bruce and Jack outdid themselves on the songs and score.  This movie runs a gambit of emotions. It is set in the 40's right after WWII. Two people meet,begin to fall in love, then interrupted by a third party. Lots of drama, action, romance and you never know what will happen next.  A must have for any fan of Barry Manilow. This was his first acting experience as Tony and he is terrific. Of course, I am extremely biased. Friends of mine who watched it even though they were not fans, loved it. Who knew that Annette O'Toole could sing? She also is a wonderful dancer. Joseph Bolonga is wonderful as Rico. Great supporting parts done by Ernie Sabella as Mr. Gropper the owner of the Copa and Estelle Getty as Tony's mother.",1029801600,12,815,4.530612244897959

One of my favorite films ever ! The music and story was much like watching a great classic musical from Hollywood on Turner Classic Movies. Copacabana is one of my most favorite Barry Manilow songs, so it was a joy to see how it influenced the plot, and played in the film. I can watch this film over and over. The songs, costumes, and camp all add to the fun ! The story of Tony and Lola is memorable and sweet. This DVD is a keeper.

The story is cute and Barry is charming. Kudos to the choreography and costumes, and an excellent cast. Having recently read his autobiography , I see many similarities between Barry and Tony. I wish I had seen this film years ago. I guess life got in the way. By all means, if you are a lover of Barry Manilow and his music, this is a must see.",1404259200,,512,4.224489795918367
