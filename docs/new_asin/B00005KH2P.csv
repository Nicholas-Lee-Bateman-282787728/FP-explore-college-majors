7943211,1,B00005KH2P,Not ironic.  Not erotic.  Not fun or funny.  Less than 1 star.  This one goes in the trash bin rather than getting resold.  Period US Navy educational film in the DVD extras of minor interest.,1272672000,,192,4.371428571428571
7943212,2,B00005KH2P,"You'd think my review title might be a clever comment on the film but it's more to the butchery of the censors.

If you compare the actual film to the very trailer for it which is on the same disc you will see how it's been clearly cut to rippons and most of the sex scenes, bar one, have been removed.

How this happened I do not know. The film is clearly an 18 rated so why the need for the scissors?

Anyway the film is ok but the promise of the trailer (and make of that what you will) is not delivered in the film due to the cuts.

Shocking.",1206921600,3,546,3.891891891891892
7943213,4,B00005KH2P,"In the world of exploitation cinema, Doris Wishman was a trailblazer. She also was slightly nuts. So it's only natural that she would be the one with the [moxy] to make ""The Amazing Transplant,"" the first penis transplant movie. Nerdy Arthur never had much luck with the ladies, but lately he's raping women.... The reason? That brand new penis he got (in a bloodless surgery) also gave him a new fetish that makes him lose control when he sees women wearing gold earrings! As if the story wasn't odd enough, the uninitiated might find Wishman's style a bit jarring. All dialog is post-dubbed so, in an apparent effort to avoid troublesome lip-synching, Doris tries not to turn the camera on anyone who's supposed to be speaking. If you get a feeling of deja vu while watching, that's easily attributed to the fact that much of ""Transplant,"" like many Wishman movies, was shot in and around her New York apartment. Doris also randomly cuts away from the action to study a painting, a clock or a character's feet. In ""Transplant,"" she's fond of getting shots of a ceramic horse--so much so that the horse should get its own screen credit. A meaningless idiosyncracy of the director, or perhaps symbolic of how horselike Arthur's new organ is? Let's just say that upon seeing Arthur's amazing transplant in its full frontal glory, sometimes a horse is just a horse.
In addition to Wishman's hypnotically surreal narrative, check out the included trailers to Wishman movies like ""Deadly Weapons,"" ""The Immoral Three"" and her sickest movie, ""Love Toy."" Topping off this DVD trashfest are a couple of shorts, ""Penis Facts"" and a Navy sex hygeine film that's surprisingly explicit --and hilarious.",1042848000,11,1691,4.916083916083916
