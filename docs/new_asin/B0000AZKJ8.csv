1909437,3,B0000AZKJ8,"I saw this series when it was imported by ITC for the United States and decided it had to be part of my extensive DVD collection. I'm not sure that it is something that I'll ever showcase, though I do find myself watching the series from time to time.
There are good points and bad points. First the good: Excellent transition (as mentioned in the formal Amazon review) in both picture and sound (it was never this good when broadcast).
Now the bad - The Anderson's approach to FX (Thunderbirds - style miniatures) tends to be distracting. The music is downright irritating. The stories drag and linger when you'd rather get on with them.
If that isn't enough to turn you off to the series, then you'll want this collection for its place in the SF television genre. This is the prequel series to the much better Space:1999.
There are some disturbing stories, including one that deals with time... Far too many of the episodes, though, deal with personality matters and there is considerable 1970's sexism and racism, so be warned if you are sensitive toward those attitudes. The show attempts to overcome them, but their presence, unlike the better-handled concepts in the original Star Trek series, is obvious and irritating.
Still, if you are a collector of SF from television, this is an important series in its progression...",1076630400,12,1329,4.807860262008734
1909438,5,B0000AZKJ8,"Gerry and Sylvia Anderson have long been hailed as the 20th Century's answer to Jules Verne - with foresight and vision far beyond the technology of the 1950's & 60's - Made in 1968, this series deals with the 'S.H.A.D.O' organisation, a covert section of a united world security council, who routinely patrol air, land, space and sea in search of hostile alien aircraft and subsequently destroy them.  With the aid of the Space monitoring station S.I.D and a defence base on the luna surface, they feature amazingly advanced aircraft and gadetry that would make Flash Gordon run away to his papier-mache-ed spce ship.  The former husband and wife duo who brought children around the world the amazing ""Sting-ray', 'Fireball-XL5', 'Space 1999' (featuring Martin Landau & Barbara Bain)and of course the 'FAB'-ulous Thunderbirds they have amassed a world-wide following with the brilliance of their work and clairvoyant-like view of the future (although we aren't quite living on the moon as yet in 2004)- a wonderful live action series that appeals to both old kids and young.  Ed Bishop plays Commander Straker (he also supplied the vocal talent for ""Captain Blue"" in the Anderson childrens series: 'Captain Scarlett and the Mysterons' which was made at around the same time - a more technologically sophisticated 'supermarionation' series than 'Thunderbirds', however Thunderbirds is the benchmark for all fantasty/sci-fi TV buffs (especially us 'late baby-boomers' of the 1960's).  The wardrobe styling is very 1968 with Nehru suits for the men and metallic miniskirts, purple wigs, clingy body-suits and go-go boots for the girls.  Even the cars are way out - they 'out-Austin' Austin Powers!!! - hope you enjoy it as much as I did when I first saw it in 1969.  Gerry and Sylvia ANderson are true visionaries, the likes of which are unlikely to be seen again

1909439,5,B0000AZKJ8,"I first saw the show UFO in the mid 70's on saturday afternoons, liked it for it's ""ufo"" encounters(hey I was just a kid then). Then the sci-fi channel began rebroadcasting them on Sunday afternoons for about a year. Being an adult, I really began getting into them. As another review says, it's intelligent sci-fi, not full of hokey xplosions and wows. Sure it's dated(it was made in 1969) but it's still fun stuff. excellent acting, very good scripts puts this show heads and shoulders above most others. Also, for you computer gamers out there, UFO was the inspiration for the classic game X-COM:UFO DEFENSE created by Mythos games(from England) and published by Microprose.

1909453,4,B0000AZKJ8,"The husband-and-wife team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, known for such Saturday-morning childrens fare as Fireball XL-5 and Stingray (done in Supermarionationi.e., puppets), took a leap into live action television with UFO.  To a plot as old as H.G. Wellsan alien race coming to Earth from a dying worldthey joined some pretty neat special effects and such mod clothes, hairstyles, cars, and interior set decoration as to make you think you were on Carnaby Street.  Perhaps surprisingly, it all holds up pretty well.  Sylvia Andersons Century 21 fashions, wigs, and whatnot still look sleek and imaginative.  Ironically, having first watched the show on a black-and-white television set, I was then oblivious to the unearthly (if you will) colors that were used (e.g., the famed purplish wigs worn by female personnel at Moonbase, etc.).

The special-effects work with model spacecraft, aircraft, and ground vehicles also comes off well, considering the episodes were filmed during 1969-1970.  (The CBS affiliate in our metropolitan area broadcast episodes in 1972-73.)  Those sinister, shimmery, dome-shaped UFOs (which the series characters referred to as you-foes, not you-eff-ohs) had a ring of paddle-shaped vanes near the base which spun rapidly when they were in flight.  This gave the impression of a genuineif unknownpropulsion system at work.  Add to that an eerie sound-effect that combined a continuous shrill drone with a repeated rising warble, and you had quite a memorable alien spaceship.

While some of the plots and dialogue were inane (in the very first episode, Identified, Commander Straker, portrayed by the U.S.-born, British-based actor Ed Bishop, remarks  that the alien race suffered from ""hereditary sterility""), it was a nifty show that never quite found its niche. It seems that it was syndicated to U.S. television stations, who couldn't quite decide what to do with it. In some markets, it was treated as a children's show, and scheduled accordingly, slotted in with the kid stuff.  In others, it was (correctly, I think) regarded as more mature fare and scheduled accordingly because the overall tone of the series was dark, and because some episodes dealt with topics such as adultery, divorce, drug use, andespecially memorablethe death of Strakers young son after being struck by a car.  While there were hopes of restarting production after the initial season, the show never attracted a fan base that was large enough or stable enough to justify this.

This was especially unfortunate for Ed Bishop.  Although he worked consistently in the U.K. after UFO mostly doing stage acting, voice acting, and radio; he never quite hit the big time.  His good looks and resonant voice (which sounded slightly higher-pitched on American television due to slightly-higher film-projection speeds here) should have helped him reach the level of such contemporaries as Sean Connery or Dirk Bogarde.

Alas, fate is like that: very chancy sometimes, especially in show business.

(Much as I enjoyed the show, I have deducted one star.  In my case at least, I find nostalgia invariably corrupts judgment in these matters.  Where are the snows of yesteryear?)",1429488000,,3178,5.280318091451292

Some oft he plots were a bit weak, but the special effects were excellent for the time. I especially liked the tight body suits and boots the girl agents wore, but I'm not sure why the females at MoonBase all wore purple wigs on duty.

I would have liked to have seen some resolution to the conflict, but maybe it just went off the air before that could happen.

The use of models for the different vehicles instead of computer generated graphics effects helps preventing the outdating of the ""effects"" and keeps the vehicles looking more real.

They definitely have a more adult bent than most shows today....Two episodes in particular deal more with the familial sacrifices one of the character makes to take on the SHADO project.  A lot of fun, and well worth the time.

The quality of the picture and sound is top notch.  The picture looks like it was shot recently and the sound is as good as when the show aired.  I cannot imagine the quality could possibly be any better.",1386288000,,649,4.4033613445378155
1909502,3,B0000AZKJ8,"It's a late-1960s British TV series, so don't expect it to have modern values. Given its limited budget, the effects are creative, and it's a lot more thoughtful and dystopic than Star Trek was. (Also, better acted and written, and possibly even less offensive: there are no red-shirts whose deaths are insignificant, and there are women in command roles. And they only have to wear their miniskirts off-duty!)

It still holds up. Some episodes are dreadful but some are brilliantly done, in the spirit of The Prisoner and other dystopic/mind-f**k shows of its era. The show itself is worth four stars.

But this set is another story. First of all, the episodes are arranged in a bizarre order. As most fans know, the episodes were filmed out of chronological order, and sometimes broadcast that way as well, so you'd see characters that hadn't been introduced yet or flashbacks to episodes you hadn't yet seen. The ordering on this DVD is not consistent with any other release that I'm aware of.

Second, for a ""complete megaset"" it's pretty lacking. There is no booklet at all, and the ""bonus materials"" are slim pickings. A few commentaries, some still photos (which are just video stills) a brief bio of Gerry Anderson, and the ""alternate video outtakes."" The latter are laughable; you see almost no new material, just slightly different versions of existing scenes. One disc's bonus material consists of three clips of SID (the robot satellite) singing ""Home On the Range."" (No, really.) Another features a night scene with the day-for-night filter removed. In case you didn't know they did that. The show deserves a printed book, and it would have been nice to have the bonus materials included on British releases (interviews, behind-the-scenes photos, cast bios).

However, the video transfers themselves are good quality, so I don't regret buying it. But it could have been done better.",1385683200,3,1895,5.006349206349206

1909510,5,B0000AZKJ8,"This series is Epic!  I watched it when I was just a kid growing up and I was fascinated about the concept of aliens and UFO's.  I always had very fond memories of this television series.  Last month, I recalled the theme song and it played in my head for a while.  I went on Google and listened to the music, it was just like I remembered it!  To my surprise I learned that the series had been captured on DVD and I was amazed!  I couldn't order it fast enough.  The best part is that I found it on Amazon :-)  I went ahead and ordered it and relished each episode as it brought back even more memories.  Granted this show was filmed in the early 70's so don't expect Hollywood computer cinematography like what we have today but the actors and the role they play are second to none!  Straker embodies all the qualities of a true and courageous leader.  He's perfect to preside and rule over S.H.A.D.O., an organization you'll intimately come to know as you watch these classic episodes.  There's a few cheesy fist fighting scenes that could have been re-enacted as well as a few wobbly spinning UFO's but for the day and year that they were filmed, these can easily be forgiven. The music and soundtrack plays throughout each episode and is masterfully incorporated.  I wish more Sci-Fi shows wound implement this fine technique, it's very original and I'm confident you too will agree.  I was a little disappointed with the square aspect-ratio of the film but you have to consider that back in the 70's all television sets were square and not rectangular like our modern high definition Samsung's.  The picture quality is also a little blurry but again I've been spoiled by high-def.  The sound quality average so don't expect surround-sound.  The Japanese people did reformat this series in high-definition but the cost is astronomical at over $300 usd.  If you want to spend the extra cash and you really cherish this series like I do, by all means get it!  I got the DVD set for now and in the future I may spend the extra 300 smackers.  Either way, you won't be disappointed!  If you love Sci-Fi, this set belongs in your collection!  Cheers.",1376611200,5,2149,4.541666666666667

The models for the action scenes are up to the usually Gerry Anderson standards. His ideas for the Space:1999 series were outstanding as well. This has sparked my interest in buying reproduction models from both shows now.

This was produced before Space:1999 and you will be able to pick out some ideas that were rehashed for 1999. The acting and script were good for the time.

If you are a 60.s 70's Sci=Fi fan like myself this would be a good one to add to your collection. If you can score a set for around $30.00 you can't go wrong.",1374969600,2,738,4.153846153846154

I guess I got caught up in the moment of something created by Gerry Anderson BEFORE SPACE 1999. I was hoping it would be fun, light, campy and just play ol' groovy.  This series UFO (once cancelled) created the final brainstorm to create my beloved SPACE 1999.

So UFO left me limp..... no really it did. I didn't HATE it... but I didn't fall in love with it either.  When I watch it, I read a book as I watch it.  You may be compelled to do something other than direct your full attention to the show because it is that lackluster.

Compared to the Invaders, the threat level of the aliens of this show is like comparing a nest of roaches to a gang of armed terrorists.

1909523,5,B0000AZKJ8,"One of the best SF series ever made, in my opinion, and far too little regarded today. Just an amazing theme song and gripping title sequence just to start, and it all goes up from there. How about beautiful Moon Maidens? Excellent special effects and miniature work from Gerry Anderson. Only downside might be that some of the stock footage got pretty recognizable. Other than that -- brilliant plots, lots of intrigue, even what we might now think of as an ""X-Files""-y vibe, with mysterious aliens abducting (harvesting?) human beings for unknown reasons, a secret organization as Earth's defense, even a sort of political intrigue, as from time to time it seems that different factions of these aliens exist, and there are some who are trying to make contact with us and not just dissect us. A good helping of human interest and pathos, as we see occasional glimpses of Straker's past and personal lives of other characters.

And hey kids -- THIS is how the future was supposed to look!!! Straker's car -- the coolest! The clothes -- well, ehh . . . better than jeans hanging around your knees, at least!

I'm afraid for most,this series will be bought as a trip down Memory Lane, and that younger viewers, spoiled to CGI, will be put off by the special effects. That would be a shame, because, as I say, the stories really are tremendous. This deserves to be much more of a ""cult"" hit these days.

1909536,5,B0000AZKJ8,"I used to catch this show on the old WKBD out of Detroit at odd hours of the week. They also played the 1999 series too. I was enraptured by the funky purple hair and stainless steel dresses of the Moon Base women, and the concept of SID.

The whole idea that beings from another planet would be biped and resemble earth humans was perhaps a weak point, but the show would have suffered if they had tried to have people flailing around in rubber suits like so many earlier shows did.

There is one odd and powerful point in this DVD set, and it involves an interview with Ed Bishop (Cmrd Straker). It turns out that that was the very last interview Mr. Bishop ever gave, as he passed away shortly after that.

But while this isn't on the level of the earlier Dr. Who series, this is a rock solid series with interesting plots and equally interesting characters. It totally makes sense if the planet was plagued by extraterrestrial visitors from another planet, that we humans would build such an organization, and that it would have the issues that are in several of this shows episodes.

A quality British TV show about a world being targeted by beings from another planet. It's campy, it's action packed, it's got excellent actors and fresh story plots. It is dated slightly by the times in which it was made, but even that isn't a large distraction. There are enough special features too, and behind the scenes featurettes to keep it interesting.

I only hope someone isn't out there somewhere thinking of redoing this series. It's a cult classic. Leave this one alone... Let us enjoy it.

The transfer to DVD is excellent. My only gripe is that the set used the full size DVD cases instead of the smaller and less waste full thinner cases.",1361664000,,1743,4.535031847133758

It's not that the show doesn't inject some potentially interesting elements, including personal ones, but rather that the screenplays themselves are so badly written -- there's a lot of dead air time when characters look at each other or off into the distance, sometimes with a jarring zoom in; much of the dialogue is there just to fill time rather than advance the plot; and often the ostensible challenge in an episode is a rather pedestrian one. Pacing, varying tension, true conflict and resolution -- they all go out the window; or, rather, were never in the room to begin with. Admittedly, the series had an interesting look, but even shapely women in futuristic costumes can take you only so far, and by Anderson standards the special effects and models were subpar.

Results?  I enjoyed it.

It was hard getting over the SFX.  But I had to remember that this was the early '70s.  So The Andersen's effects became- plausible.

The Science was questionable from a technical aspect. And there is plenty for a nitpicker to gnaw on.  But the human element- the character development, the stories are believable.

Watching the unfortunately (one!) season, gave me a notion to profile the Aliens.

Though I still have NO NOTION why on Luna, the female officers on the Moon, insisted on wearing purple haired wigs. It may have been a fashion statement- but why would they keep them on even when they were wearing Vacuum Suits during a potential decompression emergency?

They didn't want to be caught dead- unfashionable?",1345248000,7,897,4.649681528662421

I got round it in the end so now I can watch them on my 50 inch tv in glorious colour all the purple hair and short skirts, brings back memories.

1909557,5,B0000AZKJ8,"This review is more of a ramble, but I'm so excited about this show I'm having trouble focusing my thoughts. I had seen a few episodes on TV a few years back, but most of this was all new material for me and I devoured every second of it.

Having grown up with Stingray, Fireball XL-5 and Space: 1999, I was pretty sure this was going to be great and I was not disappointed. In fact, the only disappointment for me was that there weren't more episodes. To me this show was firing on all cylinders right up until the very last episode and could have easily run several more years.

So many people today are totally impressed with CGI but I find it never looking anywhere near as real as the world in minature created by Gerry Anderson and the talent he managed to bring to all his productions. Everything about this show just seems so right and there's something for everyone. If you loved Stingray, you have Skydiver. And if you loved Space: 1999, you have Moonbase and SID to look forward too. I won't give away all the fun, but Space: 1999 fans especially will find alot familiar here, and it made me appreciate Space: 1999 all the more. Although it certainly stands on its own, I also see UFO as an informal prequel to Space: 1999 now.

Sylvia's Andersons contributions can't be overlooked either, I find her Century 21 Fashions, a combination of Mod London meets the future quite spectacular. The very hip, very sexy costume designs for both the ladies and the men are a big part of the fun here. I also have no doubt Sylvia had a strong influence on most of the non-scientific interiors which are some stunning time capsule examples of Mid-Century Modern design.

And last but not least, it all comes to life thanks to the splendid music by hyper-talented Barry Gray. The credits and various themes used are downright addictive.

Anderson made this series groundbreaking in many categories. He put women in key roles, something not see in movies at the time. He also used minorities in key roles, something else that was ahead of the time. The sets and special effects are amazing. Ed Bishop, who was thought at the time to be the next big superstar, is excellent as the head of Shadow. Stories tried to capture what Gerry thought the future would really be like, such as working on a nuclear sub and not be covered in grease like on a diesel sub or a story about finding out the aliens are stealing human organs to transplant at the time of the first real heart transplant in South Africa. The stories were always engaging and I still find them as entertaining as I did as a teen.

I love the set. I love the extras that are included. I deducted one star for the following reasons:

- Other sets (that have been released previously, overseas) have included some other extras. (I understand that this set includes some extras that aren't in other sets. The thing is that I want them ALL.) This would be the perfect set if it had ALL the extras.

- At times, because there's a lot going on at once, plus background music, it's a bit difficult to make out what someone is saying. Captions would be extremely helpful here. I'm very surprised there aren't any.

1909571,5,B0000AZKJ8,"As a young boy the  sound of ITC theme, followed by Gerry Anderson Century 20 theme,  followed by the ""dunn dunn dunn dundundunt"" tell tale sound of the start of UFO was the highlight of my weekly tv time. Ever since I've been able to add custom ringtones on my cell phones UFO Theme has always been one of my tones.
The DVD collection did not disapoint. I went back in time 41 years the first time the theme started playing and was though I wasn't expecting cutting edge special effects I did get a bit of a kick of how innocent and naive I was as a kid to think the show was SO realistic and dramatic. The fate of earth stood in the balance every Sat at 1pm on channel 8 for a while in my mind. I never paid attention to the internal struggles of the shows characters, UN financial battles, etc. I was too enthralled that these heroes were saving the earth from alien attackers.
The DVD packaging is well done, the quality is outstanding of the videos themselves without making them look ""digitally remastered"" like some remasters do. It keeps the analog coloring and realism, keeping the imperfections of 1969 video and audio recording technology intact.
If you want to recapture the love of UFO you had as a youth, this series does a great job of bringing back the memories as well as the vision of the future they were showing. I won't get into how the vision has or hasn't worked out because this isn't a review of the moralities they were portraying but I will say the car phones and cordless landlines were just plain cool along with the Interceptors and Sky Divers.

1909578,4,B0000AZKJ8,"I remember this show as a 10 year old kid. As a 10 year old boy, it was all about the cars, the weapons, the interceptors (of which I owned three) and the underwater skydiver.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were famous for puppet shows. The likes of Stingray and Thunderbirds to name just two. They also invented ""Supermarionation"" which was a process of synchronizing the puppet's lips to the narration. Brilliant stuff coming out of the late 50's and 60's and, like so many other small boys I ate this stuff up.

UFO appeared in the late 60's under the production of the Andersons and, post analysis of the show including the plots, direction and the sets shows it's a puppet show with real people.

I got the set partially for sentimental reasons and also for the fact I fell in love with the purple haired Lt. Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake). For some reason, forty years later, the tight suits and campy overtones hold a whole different perspective for me.

UFO is, for me, unique in its moodiness. Lot's of suspicious glances, anguished faces, frantic editing under stress and the constraints of one hour to save the world or the clandestine operations of SHADO. It's campy but it's addictive in its simplicity. There are probably a total of three different sets for the whole series and the stock footage of the interceptor crews leaping into their chutes as they spring into ""Red Alert"" always raises the pulse somewhat.

The opening credits set your expectations on fire due to it's dynamic beat and synchronized explosions. The noise of the UFO as it twirled through space at SOL decimal 4.2, the aliens in their red suits and green faces, the purple haired moon-base girls talking in numbers and terms that, even though you had no idea what it meant, meant everything at the moment, all added up to an hour of blissful small boy heaven.

I never knew what happened to the series. It just disappeared one day ! But, but, they can't do this! I love Lt Gay Ellis and I'm only 10. I think the show ended at the right time or, like so many others, it would have worn itself out and gone on to keep regurgitating the same story with a different twist for too long.

UFO was a part of my childhood, part of a generation's childhood, part of the 60's history and the landscape at the time. Brilliant in its creativity and self restraint and, brilliant in its overuse of catsuits. I love every moment of it and will cherish this set for the rest of my time.

Perhaps nothing special today, given today's technology, but ground breaking back in the day. However, this series still manages to stand on its own merits. The characters are believable, the story line interesting and yes those ""scale"" models intriguing. When one disc is finished, you'll find yourself reaching for the next.

On the other hand, some aspects still seem futuristic.

1909585,5,B0000AZKJ8,"An interesting, tho dated, hardly predictable of a future a decade later, but still intelligently done sci-fi program.
This was England and the program wrapped after two seasons, but had this been America, the program might have had a longer run.
But at this time, of course, America was contending with the cancellation of Star Trek and why such an event took place (if I recall correctly, an executive's wife liked a less popular program and the more popular program was cancelled, much the same thing or similar to what happened to Gilligan's Island).
I remember UFO airing here in the states and I remember the alien's facemask breaking and the water coming out. Thought that was absolutely creepy.
But that was next to all I really remember (other than a later episode in which the fellow imagined he was fighting Mexican banditos. We were getting westerns out the wazoo, so I do recall losing interest in the show after that spectacle)
Still the program is well done, not too much of a Star Trek lite, or follow up. Perhaps a good hook from the same era, but don't expect Vulcans.

Much like Star Trek, the show seemed to struggle with the usage of women, then having the focus entirely on the women (thanks to those purple wigs).

And much like Star Trek, they sought to incorporate the women more into the show, adding Wanda Ventham (a definite plus all the way around) and giving Dolores Montez a distinct episode, Sub Smash (tho not entirely sure why the woman from Moonbase would be used in the submarine).

Still a highly recommended and good watch.",1309910400,3,1561,4.689781021897811

1909587,4,B0000AZKJ8,"I was 10 in 1970 and a full-bore SF geek, so I got this as a blast from the past.  I enjoyed it, cut it slack for the flaws...and give Gabrielle Drake 11 out of 10 for supreme hotness no matter what she is wearing.

The film transfers are jaw-dropping.  Someone archived the film with care, something that is sadly rarely done.  Then A&E blew it by running the episodes out of sequence.  Sigh.

The show is campy, I have to admit, with holes in the plot and continuity you could drive the Andromeda Galaxy through.  Yet it has strong moments and at least attempts to have an air of ""real"" SF.  Straker's agonising decision to let his son die instead of failing at his job of protecting humanity is handled well.  He's not the machine he sometimes acts like, but suffers greatly because of his decision.

Overall I enjoyed watching it again, although I found myself wishing I could go back in time and be magically appointed series editor so I could fix the overall plot arc to be more consistent, clean up continuity errors...and take the ""it was all just a dream"" episode and kill it with an axe.

I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who claim the show reeks with sexism and racism.  Women are commonly in positions of authority, and a black man is commander of the Moonbase interceptors (the captain of Skydiver is mixed-race, as well)!  In fact, there is a great scene when the black pilot is given a promotion and expresses reluctance to take it due to the fact he feels he won't be taken seriously due to his race.  Straker essentially chews him out and says he's getting the job because he's the best man for it, and -- this is this is REAL politically incorrectness!! -- perhaps he should not allow his perception of racism to lay the groundwork for possible excuse-making regarding his performance once he gets the position.  Wow.  Even now such a line would be shocking.
As for the sexy outfits, well, the guys wear some pretty tight jumpsuits (including see-through net shirts on Skydiver) and this WAS the 60s.  Women dressed that way as part of the new liberation, the freedom to show their bodies as they pleased.  Betty Freidan and Gloria Steinem were proud mini-skirt wearers!
And who cares.  The more I got to see of the utterly stunning Gabrielle Drake, the better.  What a total babe.  A shame she left the series during the hiatus.",1307664000,4,2352,4.539192399049881

My deepest apologies.
A while ago, my DVD-Player (already bought as multisystem) broke-down.  I had it overhauled, but no one informed me that, with all the replacements that took place for the repair, it was returned to me playing-back only region-2 DVDs.  I actually realized that after trying to play-back the DVDs in these series, as well as the Space 1999 - 30th anniversary edition megaset and after trying to play-back DVDs that had not experienced any problem before, but, at that time, could not be played-back.  Of course, I, then, converted it to multisystem and now everything is perfect.
Again, I AM SORRY !!!
Furthermore,
-- Packaging & Shipping: very good.
-- Meeting Delivery Deadline: very good.

Having a all region player means the worlds your oyster,  so why don't you won one yet?  the blu ray is superior to this set and like this though it has no extras.  This show was made in 1970 , so anyone who complains about special effects should be discounted probably as a reviewer in that sense.  the only way that one could realistically complain about effects is if it came out new in the last 15 years.  everything before that is what you get and people then usually liked the effects just fine because they hadn't seen newer things.  The clothes here are 1980's newwavy too with a view of what the 'future' would be like, actually the plastic clothes and purple hair were around in the next decade only it was not most folks who had them.  Still the show does good model work and has some really cool stories in it. It's just a fun show to me and on that level why not enjoy this. They should have made more seasons of it back then because it had a cool premise of aliens stealing human bodies , putting themselves into that body and taking organs etc.
It isn't like a modern show though because it is of it's time the early 70's. But who cares it's good fun and it moves fast!  The acting is fine too and I was glad to add this to my collection. The episodes look great and there's little artifacts around and that's really good news because alot of tv from that period in the U.K. was erased. thankfully we get this color sci fi funfest on dvd to enjoy and it's cheaper on amazon.com too.",1281830400,2,1796,4.105714285714286
1909596,5,B0000AZKJ8,"UFO - A lavish live action science fiction television series set in the distant future of the 1980's.  The show was developed in Britain in 1969,1970 and then released (syndicated) to American audiences in 1970, the show ran for 2 seasons before it was canceled.

  Synopsis:
I'm going to try and keep this simple, (which is not gonna happen) there are a lot more and better show summaries out there.
 The show was about a super secret base located on the Moon (Moonbase) known as S.H.A.DO.W. (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defense Organization).  Lead by Commander Ed Straker, who is a former United States Air Force Colonel, His job! To defend Earth (Mostly Great Britain though) against the horde of; Evil, Bad, Angry, Invading Aliens (pick one).  The Aliens who were in humanoid form (Mostly seen in a space suit) were here to harvest human organs to prolong and restore their dieing race (This was explained in a later episode of the series) the only sad point to this was that the aliens were never really exploited to their full potential in the series run.
  To help defend The Earth and Moon there were plenty of high-tech vehicles to save the day.  First off, Moonbase had it's own defenses, three UFO Interceptor spacecraft (each carrying one nuclear missile per spacecraft - try doing that today).  Second line of defense was S.I.D. (Space Intruder Detector) An orbiting computerized satelite around the moon to warn against oh I don't know, UFO's maybe!  Number three was an earth based Submarine known as SkyDiver, part submarine and part flying submersible which a detachable undersea-launched vehicle known as the Sky One, it's job was to attack UFO's in Earth orbit.  Last line of defense were the ground units on Earth called SHADO Mobiles, (A bus fitted with caterpillar tracks, only cooler looking).  Oh and and in a couple of futuristic cars and some gadgets and there you go.
  Now how did this organization stay hidden from the public?  Well, it was under the disguise of Harlington-Straker Studios, A movie studio in England that was located directly above S.H.A.D.O.W. Headquarters How convenient, Kill 2 birds with 1 stone).
  The action of the show was pretty well split between the Earth and Moon, There was the Moonbase interior and exterior scenes, A lot of British locations, scenic as well as SHADOW and the Harlington-Straker Studios sets.  Then there were plenty of Space shots, underwater and atmospheric shots, Flying Space ships and UFO' all via special effects.

  Plot point:
The premise of the show was fairly simple, find and stop the the Aliens at all costs. On the other hand the characters on the were fairly complex and it had it's share of complicated episodes at times (especially in the second season) plot twists and of course a lot of special effects.  The thing to know here is that this show was developed for the mature audience market and not really a kids show, but it had it's share of spaceships, UFO's and secrete hi-tech military type bases to draw in the younger audience.  But by todays standards (2010) the show falls a little on the campy side, but it still had it's share of complex scripts, (with a few psychedelic ones) characters and special effects.

  Character effects:
Female Moonbase personnel in uniforms and had purple hair (wigs maybe?) and extensive eye make-up (maybe to make them look futuristic)
Ed Bishop, who had dark hair in real life, bleached his hair white, later began wearing a white wig.
Other male characters in the series also wore wigs, it was thought they would become fashionable by the 1980s.
Oh lets not forget the sheer trousers and jump tops for the guys piloting skydiver.
The use of tobacco and alcohol consumption. Straker futuristic home bar in his office, though Straker does not drink Col. Freeman partakes fairly regularly. Straker is also seen smoking in SHADO headquarters, and many of the Moonbase personnel also light up frequently.
  Here is a basic (and I mean basic) rundown of some of the characters on the show.
Ed Straker (Ed Bishop) Former U.S. Air Force pilot and astronaut originally from Boston who organized SHADO following a series of UFO attacks in 1970.
Col. Paul Foster (Michael Billington) He masquerades as one of Straker's film producers in the studio.
Lt. Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake) Often seen as Moonbase Commander during the first half of the series.
Col. Alec Freeman (George Sewell) SHADO's first officer, Straker's right hand man at times.
Gen. James Henderson (Grant Taylor) Straker's superior officer, He heads the International Astrophysical Commission, a front for SHADO at times a not
  so likable guy, which helped add contention to the series.
Capt. Peter Carlin (Peter Gordeno) commander of the submarine SkyDiver and pilot of its interceptor aircraft, Sky One.
Lt. Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez) Space Tracker at Moonbase, later replacing Lt. Ellis as its commanding officer.
Capt. Lew Waterman (Gary Myers) An Interceptor pilot on the Moon, later promoted to captain, replacing Peter Carlin as commanding officer of Skydiver
  and pilot of Sky One.
Lt. Keith Ford (Keith Alexander) SHADOWs main communications officer.
Lt. Ayshea Johnson (Ayshea Brough) SHADO headquarters officer, also seen waving at an (offscreen) Col. Alec Freeman in the opening credits.
  There were obviously more characters that appeared on the show, but I figured these were worth mentioning.

  Special effects:
This is what the show is all about here, no not todays SFX, CGI, motion control model space ships.  In those days the show was about model space ships, UFO's (Held up with wires), underwater submarines, flying subs, transporters on treads, on and on.  The overall effects were quite good noting the Moonbase model, the Moonbase interior sets, S.I.D. space station, UFO Interceptors, The actors in spacesuits weren't bad, the physical sets were very well done as well all the flashing lights and futuristic cars.
  Special effects were supervised by Derek Meddings, which were of the highest quality of there time, considering how the limited resources of the special effects shop.  Skydiver and Moonbase, SHADO pilots enter their interceptor craft by sliding down tubes. Kudos to the Andersons' earlier Thunderbirds to series.  SHADO HQ and Moonbase control consoles, computers, lighting panels make later appearances in Doctor Who, Blake's 7, also in 007's Diamonds Are Forever.  How can we forget the Trimphone, a British model of telephone designed in the 1960s.
  The down side would be the UFO's that looked like shinny spinning tops, some of the model underwater scenes that sometimes looked like it was filmed in a fish tank, the astronaut space walks that end up looking like small dolls on wires (the dolls or figures were static, this tended to make them look like little tiny flying dolls).  The computers in the show used magnetic tape drives that just kept spinning and spinning and spinning, the green computer screens.  This is what dates the the show, well the white and purple wigs, fish net attire is what really gives it that 70's charactor.

  Milestones:
The shows creator; Gary anderson who brought us (only some of his titles listed here)
  TV Series:  Supercar (1961-1962) - first Supermarionation production.
Fireball XL5 (1962-1963),  Stingray (1964-1965),  Thunderbirds (1965-1966),  Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967-1968),  UFO (1970-1971),
Space: 1999 (1975-1977),  Gary Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005).  Feature films:  Crossroads to Crime (1960),  Thunderbirds Are Go (1966),  Thunderbird 6 (1968),  Doppelgnger (1969) Journey to the Far Side of the Sun.  The special effects director Derek Meddings went on to work with George Lucas ala Industrial Light & Magic on what else STAR TREK! (Nooooooo it was Star Wars, but I'm sure He could remake Trek if He really wonted to, but thats another story). The show brought in a lot of new concepts for the 1980's, most of them didn't catch on for one reason or another.  It's the look of the show with all it's cool SFX of it's time, the outfits worn by the actors, the over all feeling of this is the Future and we've got flying spaceships, astronauts living on the moon and aliens amongst us that give the show it's look and it's attitude.  This shows not for everyone but if you like science fiction and action movies then it's worth looking into.

  Space: 1999:
The series was syndicated on American television and the ratings were initially promising to prompt ITC to commission a new season of UFO a.k.a. UFO2.
ITC considered creating the new season with the action to take place entirely on the Moon where SHADO Moonbase becomes the main headquarters.
Pre-production on UFO 2 began with extensive research and design, however ratings for the syndicated broadcasts in America dropped, ITC canceled the plans for UFO2.  Gary Anderson offered ITC a new series idea, Moonbase located on the Moon would be blown out of Earth orbit, this proposal developed into Space: 1999 leaving no trace of UFO in its plot of the show.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were pioneers in so many ways on tv. UFO is my very favorite space opera. Some have said that the acting was wooden, but I blame it on the ever slow pace used in all British films. For some reason they lend themselves to very slow paced action scenes with the exception of course to James Bond films. This was the case for the first half of the episodes of UFO. They were very good but a little slow paced. For the second half of the episodes I understand they had a new director who snapped up the pace and came out with some great episodes. UFO had action, Star Trek had ""talk"".  That is one of the things I always hated about Star Trek. Both show were awful in critics eyes and yet they were both loved. What bothered me about Star Trek is that of all the planets they visited, there were almost never any creatures. Most of the aliens were always very human and probably hippies. If there ever were creatures they were very cheaply made. The special effects of UFO were fabulous and very much admired. Their miniature sets have never been equalled by anything today as far as I've seen. I love the show and the dvd's. They are very amusing entertainment!",1275609600,2,1340,4.381526104417671

The moon base  is their in a bit of a different form. The costumes are more 60's than 70's in 1999.  But it hasn't aged as well as 1999. But if you like serious campy action and can do without the modern CGI effects. This is the one to see. The effects are superior even to the unremanstered TOS. And like 1999 its a bit more Gothic than my old favorite Star Trek.",1273449600,,492,4.041237113402062

1909602,3,B0000AZKJ8,"While ""UFO"" is a bit campy, if you look past the over the top visuals and special effects, you will find that the shows themselves have excellent plots.  Plus, you may find that you like the silly 'futuristic' look they created in 1970--their view of 1980 is hilarious but high on the cool factor.

So why, then, did I give this excellent series only a 3?  Well, because the folks at A&E Video are apparently quite stupid.  All the episodes are completely out of order--with no rhyme or reason for which shows are on particular disks.  Occasionally this messes up viewing.  For example, Colonel Foster was originally introduced in episode 2, but this is the fourth show on the disks--and so his appearing in the 2nd and 3rd show makes no sense.  Sloppy and  apparently the DVD producers could care less about the customers.  This, by the way, ALSO is what A&E did with their releases of another Gerry Anderson series, ""Space: 1999"".",1272931200,45,932,4.668711656441718

  This show has a lot more drama, much more character based, than I remembered. But from an adult perspective, it is one of the better classic Sci-Fi shows to re-experience. It also has more suspense than many SciFi TV shows, which is refreshing. (On a funny nostalgic note, I think one or more characters are  smoking a cigarette in every scene, except in space.) The effects sequences were well done, even though these days, the footage would feel like its recycled too often.
  This is a complex show with many recurring ""locations"" to get acquainted with. Quite a large undertaking for TV at that time, and even now, really.  It is amazing that it was produced ""before"" Star Wars, and possibly was part of the inspiration for the whole ""soap opera in space"" genre. Some great commentaries...

Having fond memories of UFO, I jumped at the chance to get it when I saw the series collection was available on Amazon .

Although the standards for special effects and writing are not on par with a modern Science Fiction show like Battlestar Galactica, I still found it entertaining. It still did provide some interesting concepts for science fiction. As an example, the aliens breathe a liquid because of the high speed of the UFOs.

1909614,5,B0000AZKJ8,"Until I ordered the UFO Complete Megaset, all I could remember about the show was how cool I thought the UFO's, spacecraft, Moon Base, etc., were when I was a kid.  I also remembered Commander Straker as a blonde man in charge, but that's about it.  As a young boy all I cared about were the cool special effects, props, and spacecraft.  Watching it now as an adult I find it more entertaining than ever!  Maybe for different reasons than most?  For anyone like myself who is tired of today's political correctness being shoved down our throats all the time, watching several episodes of UFO is a breath of fresh air!  As corny and low budget as some of it comes across at times, this show was made in a time prior to political correctness.  Most of the lead characters are trying so hard to be cool that it's kind of funny!  Commander Straker is actually quite an ""A"" hole, but he pulls it off because in his position and environment, he has to be.  He is short with his subordinates and sometimes over bearing, but somehow I still like the character, probably because he is trying to save the world after all.  Today everyone is up in arms about someone smoking on tv or in a movie.  It's a hoot watching everyone on the show trying to out smoke and out drink each other!  There was a scene in S.H.A.D.O.W. control where I swear everyone in this top secret base was lit up!  And one scene Straker gets out of his cool futuristic car and just flips his cigar onto the ground like he doesn't give a crap.  Ha Ha!  Could you imagine the litterbug & anti smoking groups going bonkers over that today?  Another concept about the series where I get a great laugh... sexual harassment is alive and well in S.H.A.D.O.W.!  The female S.H.A.D.O.W. personnel are all decked out in the smallest of mini skirts or skin tight jump suits, and all the male counterparts are trying to ""get some""... especially the high ranking command staff!  After being in a government job for 25 years, I laugh my butt off watching some of the male/female interaction scenes knowing that today most would be unemployed, and there would be countless sexual harassment law suits pending!  It's fun watching people be themselves, say what they want to say, and do what needs to be done, without all of today's political correctness and rules preventing it!  And with all that in mind, the UFO's, Interceptors, Mobiles, Sky 1, Moon Base, etc etc, are all still very cool!  So the kid in me still loves the Sci-Fi of ""UFO"" while the adult in me can appreciate the stories and characters more now.  This series is highly recommended!",1255046400,13,2598,4.530042918454936

The Shado organization has a manned moonbase with spaceships, an orbiting early detection artificial intelligence satellite (SID), a fleet of submarines that can launch fighter airplanes, a fleet of land rovers, and a set of aircraft and orbital launch vehicles to ferry the stars of the show.  All of this vast and secret infrastructure is commanded from an HQ located under, get this, a working movie studio.  Commander Straker's secret identity is that of some kind of studio executive.  So this lends to all kinds of pretty women and cool cars etc.

The show's theme song steals the entire show - it is quite simply amazing even for today's standards.  The show is tightly written and does not suffer from some of the shortfalls of foreign shows from this era: that is, its plots don't degenerate into 1960s mumbo jumbo so common to the era and aren't as slow as the molasses in January.  The show is tightly woven, well directed, and the entire show feels solid.

I must say though that the stars of the show, particularly the males like Commander Straker, Colonel Freeman, and Colonel Foster would have to be classified as male shovanist pigs and jerks by today's standards although likable in their own ways and fair in all respects and popular with the ladies of the time.  All kinds of sexual and male shovenist innuendo permeate the show like sending the women to fetch coffee etc.  The women wear the smallest of skirts and skimpiest of outfits and they are extremely attractive women at that but why would men be dressed in regular clothes and women have to wear skirts so short that their underwear shows?  Yes in some shows the men wear similar minimal outfits but it is always the ladies who wear the skimpiests of outfits the most.  It is fair to say that the show featured some beautiful and very talented ladies like Delores Mantes, Antonia Ellis, Gabriella Drake and I am sorry to say that seeing these gorgeous women wearing the minimal outfits they were wearing on this show, in part would force me to acknowledge that I too have some male shovanist pig in me (they are that beautiful and yes they can turn even honest humble men to sin)....Finally, there is also ample smoking throughout the show by almost everyone.

In other respects and as some kind of dichotomy, the show is quite ahead of itself with women assuming leadership roles and holding very serious positions with minorities holding the same types of leadership roles that you'd find in a modern society.  In Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's defense, it is conceivable that this future world they invented was just a very open and permissive society much like the 60s but even there, some of the gender bias is evident.

Aside from not having as much metaphysical physics nonsense or a slow plot, the psychadelic 60s do bleed fully into the show in virtually every other area in a much more pervasive way than it did with Star Trek or how the 70s permeated BattleStar Galactica or Star Wars.  As an sidenote in typical Gerry Anderson fashion the 70s permeate fully the show space 1999 which is a show that Anderson did after UFO, so this was probably intentional with UFO but with Space 1999 much more of the metaphysical stuff bleeds in.

Regarding the UFOs, the show revolves around having to mobilize the defense sytems to shoot down these silvery spinning UFOs on a regular basis.  There is always concern about UFO aliens infiltrating Shado and sometimes we do get to see some actual aliens who as I remember appear to come from some kind of ecologically devastated world (so the environmental aspects get fit into the show on some tangential manner).

Overall, UFO is fantastic and if you watch all the episodes, you get a feel for why Straker is so serious and such a jerk per se; it all has to do with the weight of such a burdensom command on his shoulders and it comes out that Shado is virtually built through his tenacity.  You get a real good appreciation for Straker, also, you get to identify with this great artistic performance of the late Ed Bishop who plays Straker very well and we can't forget the great performances by George Sewel, and Michale Billington who play great memorable supporting characters.  I first saw the series as a child and just remember the cool special effects, which are still fantastic, but watching the show on DVD brings out the complex plots (well complex for 60s TV) and quite a few other elements I missed as a child.  By contrast, watching Buck Rogers in the 25th century, while still a guilty pleasure for me, tends to bring about uncontrollable laughter at how low the roundkicks were and various other aspects of that great show. UFO though is much more serious and dark and delves into the fallacies of humanity.

The DVDs are nice but don't have a ton of extras, you get the DVDs and that's about it.  If you saw Star Trek, you need to see UFO.  If you saw Space 1999, UFO is better in my opinion.  Don't expect Buck Roger's comedic fare, this show is pure Drama set in the psyschadelic 1960s - odd mix but Straker pulls it off.",1231372800,4,5329,4.647497337593184

Amazon has been a great place to pick up shows I thought I would never see again and UFO is one of them.

By today's standards UFO has a ton of things you could poke a stick at, but taken in the context of the era it was broadcast this is a first class show.

The stories are great, the costumes are psychadelic and the music a trip!

1909632,4,B0000AZKJ8,"The television series UFO was set in the then future year 1980, but even today it seems like a  foggy glimpse of the future.  Although some of the technological  predictions were less than accurate,  however, the subject matter prefigures such works as  Men in Black, X-files, and Torchwood.
The best way to describe the premise is as an alternative X-files where the `cigarette smoking man ` is the hero.  Ed Straker has two goals. The first is to defend the  Earth  against attacks by UFO's. He does this with a  secret organization called SHADO, which  has at its disposal a fully staffed Lunar Base, Moon launched interceptors, and a submersible aircraft carrier. He also has to keep the general public from finding out about this interplanetary war.  To do this he uses a movie studio as a cover for his operation, with an efficient receptionist played by the late Lois Maxwell, who is well versed in putting the 'secret' in 'secretary', having also  played the efficient receptionist Moneypenny in the James Bond movies. He also employs an amnesia drug on those people who have either seen a UFO or anything else to do with his operation.  Think of the MIB's neuralyzer or Torchwood's Retcon.
The writing is uneven, but in the episode `Destruction' ,Anderson borrows from an interesting source. In the episode, the aliens have a human operative who is coerced into sending them the data they need  by beaming it through a telescope. Arthur C. Clarke used the same technique in his novel  Earthlight<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchwood-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B0013GS3WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchwood - The Complete Second Season</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-1999-30th-Anniversary-Edition-Megaset-17DVD/dp/B000P6R5TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space 1999 - 30th Anniversary Edition Megaset (17DVD)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-The-Complete-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000UZDO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files: The Complete Collector's Edition</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earthlight/dp/0345430700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earthlight</a>",1225670400,,2253,6.883802816901408

Characters are very interesting.  And how many young boys didn't want to be Col. Paul Foster?  (NOTE to James Bond producers:  you blew it when you decided against Michael Billington as the ""new"" James Bond.)  But everything about the show was, and continues to be, fascinating.

1909642,5,B0000AZKJ8,"I was 9 in 1970. Though UFO was aimed at an adult audience, I immediately became enamored with the series. I thought it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen. All my kid friends and I were enamored with all the hardware. We all wanted to BE Straker. He had the cool car, the hot chicks, and the killer job. And the show is still cool today. Although, as I look back at these episodes today, with the groovy music with hammond organ sounds, the bright colors, the mod 70's decor, the hokey wigs, and the nehru suits, I can't help but expect Austin Powers to walk onto the set and say, ""To heck with the aliens, let's go in the back and shag some of these hot moon chicks, baby, yeahh!"". And yes, those moon chicks WERE hot.

I've watched every episode all over again now, and it's a piece of TV history I wish more people knew about. I've always loved everything Gerry Anderson ever did, and this collection is a jewel in his crown. For the most part, the acting is respectable, and often REALLY great, particularly the main characters. Of course, there are dazzling special effects (the pre-CGI model work is really amazing for its day), Derek Meddings sure blew stuff up good, the costumes are fantastic (anybody know where I could pick up a nehru suit?) and the remastered picture quality of this set is phenominal. Watching these episodes NOW (upconverted to 480p) is better than when I watched it on 70's era TV tubes; it's like night and day. And, the opening music and visuals was so well-designed and really gave the series some excitement.

Of course, the technical impossibilities are bountiful (smoking rocket engines underwater and in-space explosions where smoke goes UP), and the plot holes are big enough for the Thunderbirds to all fly through. But that's what we expect from Anderson's work, and we like it that way. Although the storytelling in many episodes is quite good. I really found myself empathizing with Straker in the episode where his son was killed. I really wanted him to divert that plane with the medicine away from the UFO incident and save his son's life (that's what I would have done for my children - the safety of a little old blind lady be damned).

The only failings of this box set lie with the producers who gathered the original series actors for voice commentary. Ed Bishop who played Straker did a voice commentary for an episode before he died, and it appears in this set. He's old, and his voice doesn't sound like it used to, but what is most maddening is that they did not give him a list of things to talk about or fan questions to answer. They also did not give him another series actor to reminisce with. This made his commentary sort of flat and he had nothing to ""play against"" and nobody to speak to. He's just in a sound booth watching the episode and talking to himself. There are long silences where I was wishing he would have commented about various behind the scenes details, told humorous anecdotes, or talked about things the fans really cared about. It's really not his fault, and the producers should have set this up better and given him better direction. Now, he's gone, and so are his unique recollections with him. Very sad.

The other voice commentaries are much better, particularly the one with Michael Billington (Paul Foster). Very funny stuff. I wish they had dug up even more folks from the series and did more voice commentaries. Sadly, many of them are dead now.

If you love anything Gerry Anderson has ever done, buy this series. After all, Gabrielle Drake in that tiny miniskirt is well worth the price of admission.",1208476800,3,3595,4.584758942457232

The U.F.O.'s are coming and it's SHADO's job to stop them under the command of Ed Straker! Underground headquarters: cool and hip. The elevator office Straker uses makes no sense as a covert entrance but who doesn't want one of those at some point? Moon base, cool and sexy. Everyone wants to know, why do we have to wear these purple wigs? Interceptors, brilliant. Here's why. The aliens are blasting us with lasers. What do we have? A single missile loaded on the front of our 3 slow, ships. One shot each. We're outgunned and outwitted tech wise even in 1980! Mobiles, cool if a bit much. Not the most covert vehicle to sneak up on a crashed U.F.O. is it? Moon buggies and lunar modules, very cool. Sky One and Skydiver submarine, absolutely cool. Launching a very sophisticated jet fighter from the front of a roaming submarine is earth's last line of defense against the U.F.O. It looks fantastic and the application is flawless. Fashions, groovy. I like Ed and Alex's attire. U.F.O.s, perfect in their simplicity. Flying saucers making a very, very alien sound. The cars, burned in my memory as a child for almost 40 years. Gull wing doors? Insanely wide vehicles with zero styling? Is this the future of the automobile in the 80's? You bet it is so sit back and enjoy it! Much better than ""Space:1999"" which replaced it a few years later. The duality of trying to predict a future that is now 30 years in the past is priceless. It's not so much about what is happening on the screen but how it was presented at the time. It's fun, fun, fun. Isn't that why we watch TV in the first place?",1205712000,,1935,4.453521126760563

This 1970's Gerry Anderson production is set in the future (which was about the 80's). Aliens in spaceships that look like wobbly spinning tops try to come to earth th kidnap humans for body parts to save their dying planet. The series is about the government funded SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation) who are tasked with protecting the earth from the aliens. They use submarine based fighter planes and moonbased ships to attack any UFO's that attempt to come to earth.

Unlike Gerry's previous efforts like the Thunderbirds that were based on puppetry, UFO uses real human actors and props and ""supermarionation"" puppetry  for animated special effects. The series is primarilary about the characters with dated but great special effects. The storlines are creative and the lead actors are interesting in a way that US productions of the era never managed. This series has it all! Funky 70'5 music, mysterious aliens, hilarious fashions like purple wigs and short skirts, see through netting shirts.

It is an ambitious and mature series in a universe where the swinging 60's has become the even more swinging 80's.  To that extent it is has an Austin Powers meets Battlestar Galactica (2000's reimagined) feel to it.  Overall, however this is a very tense, dark, and confronting TV show that focuses a great deal on human drama and the desperateness of an overworked and stressed group of people whose job is nothing less that the defense of mankind.  The fact that this war is fought in secret means that those fighting it have to sacrifice any semblence of having a life in saving others.

Highly recommended for mature sci-fi fans.  It has dated in all the right ways.",1178409600,2,808,4.462585034013605
1909652,4,B0000AZKJ8,"Actually, that's not true.  But what is true is that at the tender age of seven, there was this great show on TV called 'UFO'.  This would have been 1972, just as the real moon landings were winding down, and I was addicted to everything ""space"", even Captain Kangaroo's journeys alongside the astronauts on the lunar landings (being seven, I didn't realize that the good Captain was on a soundstage beside a mockup of the LEM.  As far as his walking around sans spacesuit, well, he wasn't an astronaut, so he didn't get to wear one!).

So, to me, the idea of a fully function moonbase fighting off the alien menace in the far-flung future of 1980 seemed all too plausible, far more so than the idea that we would turn our back on space travel and content ourselves with exploring the vast dullness of LEO.  Add to that mega-cool Intercepters (which I always mispronounced as 'Uniceptors'; after all, they had only the one missle!), the fish-faced lunar lander, liquid-breathing aliens, sea-launched aircraft (never noticed the fishnet uniforms, for some reason), moon-women is purple wigs, and the creepy whine of the UFOs themselves.

But for me, the real star was SID: the Space Intruder Detector.  I don't know why, but to this day, that cool, British-English voice calmly being generated by the ship's on-board computer was the neatest thing posible.  Anyway, the opportunity for this now 42-year-old man to relive a boyhood fantasy was too much to resist (I told you the title wasn't true!).

So far, I've viewed six of the episodes.  Picture quality and sound are very good, although my PCs DVD player has some problems with the menuing system.  The special effects are, of course, crude by modern standards, but still, on occasion, impressive for their time.  The acting, on the other hand, is middling at best, while the stories have been, on the whole, very good, but told poorly.  And with his bleach-blond hair, Ed Straker (Ed Bishop), looks more like one Gerry Anderson's Supermarionette dolls than an actual human being (I wonder if that was intentionl).

Something of a suprise is the length of these episodes.  Each one is roughly fifty minutes, a good 20-25% longer than modern ""hour-long"" TV shows.  At that rate, by 2100 the average hour-long TV show should be 40 minutes of commercials.  Also suprising is the strange combination of intelligent and capable women and bald-faced sexism; Lt. Uhura's miniskirt appears tame in comparison to the moonsuits that can easily shed arms, legs, whatever, in a matter of seconds, and the camera never hesitates to focus on a ladies ""bum"" (well, it's a English show, might as well use the English euphemism!).  As a child, I never noticed this, or the before-mentioned fish-net ""uniforms"" of the Skydiver crew.

Still, it's all very interesting, jogging the old neurons, shaking my head at the stilted dialog, yet the actual stories are compelling (the episode 'Survival' is one I remember as a child, yet seeing it again just makes me realize how much better it could have been).  I'm hoping the later episodes get better, as there does seem to be a general improvement as I progress from one to the next.

My greatest hope: once 'Battlestar Galactica' has finished its revival on SciFi, someone gives 'UFO' the same treatment.  Many of the old stories could be reworked and given the 'Galactica' treatment, and I'd be glad to give SciFi helpful suggestion on how to do this (for a nominal fee, of course).

Now, if you'll excuse me, SID is calling to me...",1177459200,4,3516,4.833055091819699

It is Thunderbirds without any strings, the acting very similar to our marionette budies. But it was 1969, before any real  computer special effects. Taking that into account, it's not a bad piece of sci-fi TV history.",1171238400,4,387,4.6911764705882355
1909654,5,B0000AZKJ8,Awesome find well worth the money. This series was so far ahead of its time.,1171065600,3,76,4.133333333333334
1909655,5,B0000AZKJ8,"UFO seems darker than most Sci Fi of the time.  The aliens are creepy and evil in sort of an X-Files way, and earth is in trouble unless it can mount a strong defense.

Fortunately earth has S.H.A.D.O. and Commander Straker working to protect it.  Straker is driven, single-mindedly, to save the people of earth from the aliens.  In addition to showing the various ways (some of them really nasty) in which the aliens threaten and harm people, UFO follows the development and operation of the S.H.A.D.O. defenses. Viewers get to see some really cool weapons systems at work.  At the same time, they see the human side of S.H.A.D.O., including political issues with funding and security, and the toll the work takes on Straker and others.

Measured against today's Sci Fi, I think UFO holds its own in some ways but shows its age in others.  The special effects seem to have been about state of the art for the 1969-70 period (subject to some budget constraints here and there), but of course they can't compare to modern CGI.  Some of the effects look pretty darned good even today, and I think this is because the show was shot on film so there were excellent images to transfer to DVD.  But at times a cheesy special effects shot (or a continuity error resulting from reusing a shot that doesn't really fit) will pop up.  This was the first ""human"" show produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson of ""puppet"" fame (Thunderbirds, Stingray, etc), so to me the very well done action photography of miniatures is part of the charm, and I'll forgive the occasional lapse. The sets and costumes for UFO were pretty darned imaginative, and I love the moonbase outfits, Straker's hair, and the Nehru jackets.

The human interaction suffers a bit in some places as a result of changes in the cast.  There was a break in the middle of the series due to a need to move from one studio to another, and some of the characters moved onto other work during the break.  This put a crimp on what could have been some continued development of the dynamics between a few key characters.

It's too bad UFO didn't come back for a second season.  The first season laid the groundwork for what could have been an even better set of episodes, as S.H.A.D.O. expanded to better meet the UFO threat and to adapt to some of the aliens' scary counter-measures, and the aliens showed what further tricks they had up their sleeves.  Maybe we could have learned more about the aliens as well.

The added features in this DVD set are relatively limited, but they include commentary on a few episodes, a bunch of still photos, and some outtakes.  Nothing overwhelming, but nice to have (especially the commentaries).

Overall I love this set.  UFO remains a fun show to watch, the picture quality is amazing for such an old show,and I just can't get that opening theme out of my head!",1168992000,6,2847,4.6
1909656,5,B0000AZKJ8,"Sure, they were still flying models with wires, the music was heavy '60s (yet very catchy) and the wardrobe was ""far out"", but beneath the outdated surface (it was set in the future: 1980) was a very intelligent and well thought out show. One scene that came to mind was a character getting chewed out for not having answers from the computer yet. Her response responded with ""we just aven't figured out how to ask the question correctly"" and proceeded to tell all the different ways they had tried asking. I mention this particular because I actually had the same conversation with a friend just the other day concerning Google searches.. ask the question the wrong way and you won't get the right answer.

It looks cheezy on the surface, but it is actually pretty dark, deep and suprisingly accurate for the time. If you liked Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlett or Space, 1999, this is a MUST have. It is easily Garry Andersons best work.. too bad it only lasted a year.",1168041600,6,968,4.6608187134502925

1909658,5,B0000AZKJ8,"UFO and me go back to the 70's. I was too young to see it when it first aired; I was part of the 70's growing up on Star Trek as my main Sci Fi diet after school along with UFO at weird times on the weekends. Because the show only lasted one season it couldn't be shown like Trek everyday, so when you were lucky enough to catch it, you watched it to see the humans defend earth from the aliens. There were awesome special effects in UFO, and as big a Trekkie as I am UFO's effects blew it away. Even in that limited context in the 70's when I could catch it it stayed with me as one of my favorite shows EVER. Flash forward to around the year 2000, I'm selling high end home entertainment electronics and in the satellite TV area I am flipping through the menus and see that my favorite show UFO is now being shown regularly on the Sci Fi channel, awesome but how does it hold up? After all I was a kid when I first watched it and technology and things have changed. Well, UFO was not only still awesome to watch in the 21st century but I found out it had a coherent story line and character development as well, who would have known? I could go on and on about UFO but if you are into Sci Fi, the 1960's-70's era, Gerry Anderson stuff, or all of the above you must see UFO. It's the most serious and best show he put together in my opinion other than The Thunderbirds (I haven't seen everything he's done but I've seen most). I guess it was ahead of it's time or something, maybe the budget was too big, but it's a real shame that it was not picked up for a second season, in the audio commentary with Gerry Anderson he says it was because it didn't get picked up in America, shame on us! Still, being the optimist I am, I'm happy I have one season of UFO to enjoy. Straker is my favorite character,
if you watch the show you learn how flawed he is. He's divorced because he's a workaholic and has been entrusted with knowledge that only few know. His Son is tragically killed by him in an auto accident, the man is a wreck who plunges himself into his work, saving earth from an alien invasion. This show made me an Ed Bishop fan but I havn't found much to cheer about in his other appearences (he was in Battle Beneath The Earth, thats about all thats memorable, the rest are small roles, he was briefly in 2001 ASO, and Diamonds Are Forever). The supporting characters are all great and even though the show only lasted one season we get into their lives as well. Another great part of the show is the Aliens and the mysteries that surround them. What are their motivations? Why don't they talk to us humans? What are they up to (no good for sure!)? It made the show interesting for me as a kid and the character development kept it going for me as an adult. Throw in the very cool ships and weapons from the years of experience Gerry Anderson had and it stands up as one of the best sci fi alien shows ever made. You have got to love the touch that Anderson made when he gave the humans guns and atomic bomb space missiles and he gave the aliens lasers, showing their superior knowledge. It's little touches like that that give it plausibility and make it a serious sci fi show. If you haven't seen UFO please do but try to catch it from the beginning, it does have a storyline. My favorite episode ""The Physco-bombs"" , one could easily put it into a 9-11 suicide bomber reality today, this show was so ahead of it's time. As for A&E's ""Megaset"" madness, one season shows do not a mega set make. I wish this was 1/3rd the price but as so many love this show it's price for sale remains high, that's strong proof of the shows quality. Highly recommended if you can afford it, or if you're looking for an extra cool gift for a Sci Fi fan, this is a sure gift they will appreciate. My Amazon rating is 5/5 even with the high price.

1909659,4,B0000AZKJ8,"As a child of the 1970s, I grew up watching many television shows, including reruns of Star Trek, Space 1999, Kolchak:The Night Stalker, and UFO. At the time, I was too young to put these shows into perspective. I ordered this show and prepared to sit down and watch all 26 episodes in two weeks. My poor housemates who heard nothing but that wonderful, inventive, and creative opening score. This show is far more consistent in content, writing, acting, and effects than Space 1999 (although, I love those eagles). Skydiver is awesome. Ed Bishop in the lead role as Straker did a wonderful job. It was sad to hear his commentary on one episode because he seemed to have information, but he seemed to struggle to retrieve it. There are long pauses in his commentary. Gerry Anderson's is the most infomative. This show does a wonderful job of showing the impact that protecting the Earth has on its memebers. Viwers see tension, lost relationships, and even the deaths of loved ones. Like any show there are aweosome episodes and horrible episodes; as a whole, the show is very even.

Treat yourself to a show that is fun and relaxing (also pick up Space 1999). Both of these shows added to science fiction of the 1970s.",1151020800,19,1219,4.669767441860465

The special effects are often spectacular even by today's standards (I'd much rather see good model work than poor computer animation any day).  The scripts are inventive and moody.  The drama is occasionally great, but sometimes is cliche and serves as a distraction from the plot unlike, say original trek where the drama was a natural extension of the plot.  The outdated view of the future is actually part of the charm, but also, if one considers that the future they were attempting to project was only 12 years off, perhaps it isn't that outdated after all.  I found no rascism or sexism in this series however, unlike some overly sensitive viewers here (the freedom for women to bare their bodies was considered part of their ""liberation"" in the late 60s).  In fact, the show sports an attractive female colonel who is taken seriously by her colleagues.",1141257600,78,928,4.732919254658385

footnote or short description of it on a website devoted to British television shows.

At most, I saw only 8 or 9 episodes.  I would 'break my neck' getting home in time to enjoy the show, as I was a Sci-Fi fan!  What stayed with me to this day was how SHADO would deal with the 'aliens' and the effects that the duty would have on them.  On a lighter note, those mini-skirts!!  I was thoroughly convinced that all British must have had legs like that (smile).  I was disappointed when the series was taken off the air, only to find out some 30+ years later that series was available on DVD!  Of course, I bought them.

From the cars to the Interceptors to Skydiver and SID itself, this show was just plain fun! The alien ships (even using that standard 'circular, spinning design') had a futuristic look we could work with and accept as dangerous and menacing. It was also nice to see a well mixed cast that gave the show an international feel fitting for a world defense group. The stories and acting were first rate; and special effects were anything but campy and quite impressive in a time when models were the call of the day, StarWars was still a dream and any computers around were the size of rooms. True, by today's programming, it's dated but that shouldn't be a fault. This show was AHEAD of itself in the late 60's, early 70's and that says a great deal to the concept of the Andersons. There were wireless phones, car phones, electronic doors, and many small things that seemed advanced and yet we have in use today. You can see where later works like Space 1999 drew from. The clothing might be a bit sexist (silver lame and purple wigs) and very time-dated in those pastels, (still, you gotta LOVE the fish-net shirts!), it was then a look into a possible future and one you can be sure many designers of the day put to good use. Then there's that theme song... Well, that says it all. Any show with a theme song that good DESERVES to be on DVD. So sit back and enjoy the adventure.

1909666,3,B0000AZKJ8,"This was Gerry Anderson's first series using real ""live"" actors--his previous efforts were mostly sophisticated children's fare filmed in Supermarination, shows like ""Stingray"" and ""Captain Scarlett""--basically impressively detailed puppets used on scaled-down sets.  UFO is an interesting pop artifact from 1969-70 about an elite paramilitary organization--SHADO--dedicated to fighting a worldwide threat from an alien race.  Although somewhat dated, the series has an expensive look to it--the use of miniatures and special effects are impressive as is the costume design, the cars, the sets, and yes, those crazy purple wigs (never explained)--but the acting remains
somewhat wooden especially in the lead players with the exception of George Sewell, a noted English TV actor who has appeared in many fine UK dramas such as Special Branch and Public Eye.  Many see the series as a precursor to Space 1999, but the similarity ends there.  In UFO, there was no real attempt to understand the alien race-just to destroy them.  Space 1999, for all its faults, at least attempted to explore the ""let's just try to communicate with them"" theme four years later.  As a result, these green skinned aliens from UFO--albeit very human looking ones (low rent special effects here--just extras from Pinewood Studios with green makeup on their hands and faces) only serve as merely cannon fodder for our intrepid band of 70's mod superheroes.

Wrong, somehow Ed Bishop as Straker, Michael Billington as Paul Foster, and Gabrielle Drake in her purple wig - make it work.

This is fast paced, rock em, shoot em up absolutely fun from beginning to end. You have Bishop and Billington for the girls to drool over, Drake and various other purple headed big chest beauties for the guys to oogle....I mean what more can you ask for....

This is volumes 5-8 are actually better than 4-8. This series has some really strange problems, the Moonbase girls had to work in purple wigs (never explained), this is supposed to be futuristic (1980s! hehehe) and yet everyone looks like a over-aged refugees from Carnaby Street after a discount swinging 60's sale, you have aliens suffering from 'hereditary sterility', aliens breathing blue liquid and stealing body parts from the earthlings, and the only hope for mankind is English military branch under Shepperton Studios, and to top it off created by the team that brought you Fireball XL5, Stingray and Captain Scarlet - PUPPETS!

1909670,5,B0000AZKJ8,"""UFO"" was a short-lived sci-fi fantasy TV series created by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson. The premise of the show was that the governments of the nations of the Earth discover that a dying, extraterrestrial civilization has been paying clandestine visits to Earth with the sole purpose of kidnapping & killing humans to harvest their body parts.  The United Nations authorizes and funds a highly secretive international organization nicknamed SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defense Organiztion) to combat the alien threat.

Under the command of Colonel Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop), SHADO creates several different means of protecting Earth from the aliens:

1. A sosphistaced underground computerized headquarters pretending to be a major film studio in the heart of London.

2. A manned base on the moon (called Moonbase) armed with three fighters to attack UFOs before they reach Earth.

3. A sophisticated control & radar tracking satellite called SID (Space Intruder Detector) orbiting the Earth to detect incoming UFOs.

4. A fleet of submarine fighter carriers (called Skydivers) called upon to attack UFOs in Earth's atmosphere should the Moonbase fighters fail to destroy UFOs in space.  Each Skydiver is capable of launching a single fighter called Sky One (or using some other numbered designation).

5. A fleet of sophisticated armored personnel carriers called Mobiles to seek out and destroy UFOs that manage to land.

6. Other support craft like moon rovers, the Lunar Module (used to shuttle Moonbase personnel between the Earth & moon), and other support aircraft.

The 26 episodes of the series focus on several recurring themes:

1. SHADO's continual attempts to avert the alien's plans & attacks.

2. The various ways in which the aliens attempt to destroy SHADO or its commander, Colonel Ed Straker.

3. The effect that being a SHADO operative has on one's personal life, often focusing on Straker's personal life, but also Colonel Paul Foster's (played by Michael Billington).

4. SHADO's attempts to obtain more information about the aliens.

5. Security threats to the secrecy of SHADO.

6. Ongoing funding issues for very costly SHADO expenses (usually battles between Straker and General Henderson, played by Grant Taylor).

""UFO"" very much has the look, music and feel of the 1960's, since that is when it was filmed: the infamous purple wigs that female Moonbase personnel wear, the occasional hippy party, the exuberant use of bright colors in homes and go-go boots.  None of that takes away from the quality of the writing.  The dialog may not have always been top notch, but the consistency with the plot as well as the revisiting of previous storylines made for a very engaging, character-driven series.  In comparison with the Anderson's later TV series ""Space 1999"", ""UFO"" was far more consistent and interesting.  ""Space 1999"", which was originally set to be the second season of ""UFO"", never achieved the same level of character development or consistency, though its special effects were improved.

The 26 ""UFO"" episodes are as follows:

1. ""Identified"".

2. ""Computer Affair"".

3. ""Flight Path"".

4. ""Exposed"".

5. ""Conflict"".

6. ""Survival"".

7. ""The Dalotek Affair"".

8. ""A Question of Priorities"".

9. ""Ordeal"".

10. ""The Square Triangle"".

11. ""Court Martial"".

12. ""Close Up"".

13. ""Confetti Check A.O.K."".

14. ""The Responsibility Seat"".

15. ""E.S.P"".

16. ""Kill Straker!"".

17. ""Sub Smash"".

18. ""The Sound of Silence"".

19. ""The Cat With Ten Lives"".

20. ""Destruction"".

21. ""The Man Who Came Back"".

22. ""The Psychobombs"".

23. ""Reflections in the Water"".

24. ""Timelash"".

25. ""Mindbender"".

26. ""The Long Sleep"".

People who are more accustomed to expensive, computerized special effects of today may not enjoy ""UFO"" as much because its special effects are far less sophisticated; but don't let the lack of funds and lack of technology spoil your enjoyment of this well made TV series.  Overall, I rate ""The Complete UFO Megaset"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters in the series include Col. Alex Freeman (George Sewell), Col. Virginia Lake (Wanda Ventham), Lt. Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake), Gen. James Henderson (Grant Taylor, 1917-1971), Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez) and SID (voice of Mel Oxley).",1121299200,267,4263,5.250741839762611
1909671,5,B0000AZKJ8,"This is a true gem of a show!

As a young boy in the early 70's I remember watching a series about interceptors and UFOs but not really remembering too much about it.

Then along comes this great DVD set and it jogged my memory and I ordered it and have not been dissapointed at all! Ed Bishop is very charismatic as Commander Ed Straker of SHADO (Secret Headquarters Alien Defense Organization). SHADO opperates in complete secrecy beneath a British film studio in order to engage and destroy hostile UFOs sent to Earth to obtain human organs for transplanting into their own dying race.

While the show is a bit *campy* (filmed in 1970 and supposed to portray life in 1980), it is a lot of fun and has surprisingly interesting storylines. also of interest is that quite a few shows do NOT have happy endings and that is a novelty in itself.

for you gadget lovers, there are space interceptors and the Skydiver submarine and futuristic cars and all sorts of other interesting devices.

for you lovers of pretty ladies, there is the stunning Gabriele Drake as LT. Ellis (Commander of Moonbase in the early eps) in her skin tight silver catsuit or the occasional off-duty mini-skirt. frankly, all of the ladies on Moonbase are attractive and keeping with the futuristic setting they all wear purple wigs and very elaborate eye makeup. quite the eye candy for the day!

Mike Billington as Colonel Paul Foster and George Sewell as Colonel Alec Freeman are both very good and add a lot to the series.

i thought the series slid down a tiny bit after the production break and subsequent move to another studio though. when this happened, George Sewell and Gabriele Drake and several regulars left the series and i thought this affected the chemistry of the show. Wanda Ventham came on to replace Sewell as Colonel Virginia Lake but her character was never fleshed out enough in my opinion.

anyways, the music for the show is cool and the special effects for the time are quite good and many of the shows have different and interesting storylines.

There are no zap guns, silly robots, or rubber monster suits ala LOST IN SPACE. Instead, UFO would probably do better now in the age of darker sci-fi such as X FILES and the reimagined BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. The stories are frequently eerie, subdued, and downbeat.

The introduction of Paul Foster adds some interest because you get a hero, (if a bit of a shallow one!) and his Mulder-like attempts to crack a government cover-up of UFO attacks is intriguing and his offer of a place in an organization where he will be trained to fly jets, command Moonbase and fight aliens is the kind of wish fulfillment fantasy that makes every kid go ""I wish that would happen to me, that'd be so cool!"" And soon he is flying Sky 1, meeting aliens, getting accused of being a traitor, and generally getting into scrapes and adventures that grab the audience enough for us to learn interesting lessons (Such as the aliens aren't all automatically evil, as in ""Survival"") from his new-comer's point of view.

The series really hits its stride, however, about mid season, when the writers realise that the most interesting character is Commander Straker, and they focus on his character. Straker infamously loses a marriage and then a son and finally almost goes nuts from claustrophobia in three power-house drama episodes, ""Confetti Check AOK"", ""A Question of Priorities"" and ""Sub-Smash"" and opens up about it all to a lady friend in the interesting ""Responsibility Seat"", just before the major overhaul the series gets when Virginia Lake replaces Alec Freeman and the series switches to its last eight or nine episodes. This last batch features faster pace, less focus on the hardware and a lot of scripts by writers David Tomblin and Terrance Feely (who wrote for Patrick McGoohan's cult surrealistic series The Prisoner) and a contribution from ex Dr. Who scripter Dennis Spooner. These eps include such great stuff as ""Reflections in the Water"" about evil alien duplicates of our heroes and a massive UFO attack, ""Timelash"" which is the fastest and probably best episode where Straker fights a UFO and a human traitor during a time freeze, ""Mindbender"" which is truly trippy and disturbing, and the haunting ""The Long Sleep"". There's a lot of drugs, violence, sexiness and controversy in the last half of the series and all of this adds interest to a show which can be seen as getting better and better as it goes along.

Yes, the costumes are over the top, and yes, the music can be weird and too sixties, and yes, some of the early eps are a bit boring and slow and predictable. But overall, UFO grows into, in it's second half, one of the best SF shows ever made. It's worth your patience, and it is rewarding. Space:1999, the sequel series, is also recommended and if you watch this, followed by the two seasons of 1999, it becomes apparent that starchy adherence to realism slowly falls away until, by the last of 1999, it is pure, freewheeling imagination at work, and that is what makes Gerry and Sylvia Andersons three years of live action SF so compelling. Pure imagination and great story telling.",1106352000,16,3256,4.7407407407407405

My next purchase should be the ""Space: 1999"" Megaset followed by ""Star Trek"", the original series. Thanks Amazon!",1092009600,4,250,4.837209302325581
1909676,5,B0000AZKJ8,"When I watched UFO as a small child in the early Seventies, I was always looking for the gadgets.  On some of the episodes, none of SHADO Control's vehicles, moon bases, submarines, mobiles, and interceptors would appear  and I would be bored and dissapointed by my thwarted expectations.  Although I was surprised that I remembered many of the plotlines re-watching the show now, they didn't speak to me at all as a six or seven year old child the way they do to me now as a 39-year-old adult.

There is, of course, the speculative, Science Fiction, facet to UFO.  There is  also, however, the dramatic, pessimistic, human, emotionally-wretching side.  What happens to people who, because of circumstance, or duty or inertia, find themselves alone, as adults, aging, within a small, contained, almost trapped in a particular subcultural milleau?  There were three episodes in which Commander Streaker has to give up anything emotional that means anything to him.  In one, his wife,  in another, his son, and in a third, another girl with whom he forms a real, human, emotional bond.  Always it is because of duty, because of his serious, completely-committed devotion to the extreme secrecy of his calling:  to investigate the reason and motives of the UFO attacks and to try to defend humanity from it.

That is why, today, I consider UFO to be special, unique in its form, complex and non-ideal-ideological in its content.  In spite of the unrealized fashion projections of the show for 1980, the people are recognizable, and real, and like us.  The other characters on UFO are also trapped by their jobs, and trapped by their possibilities because of their dedication to the cause.  It doesn't come easy, or natural, to them, it only comes to them at a terrible personal cost.

The other subtext to the show is that the SHADO organization intercepts only a few of what is to be assumed to be a far greater number of UFO  visits to the Earth.  One watches one episode and then can only think:  How much more of this is actually going on?",1091232000,23,2040,4.7578347578347575
1909677,5,B0000AZKJ8,"This DVD set is great, I normally do not write reviews but for this one I will. As a kid I remember the Saturday late afternoon line up UFO, Star Trek then Space 1999 which myself and my best friends in the world used to watch Mike, Jim and Bob. When I received it I had to watch them all the first night, watching this DVD set reminded me of younger years with my friends alternating houses to watch it together. GREAT SET!!! I highly recommend it to any Sci-Fi buff.",1089590400,3,468,4.153846153846154
1909678,5,B0000AZKJ8,"""UFO"" had one of the most dynamic title sequences in television history. A great theme song, with a jazzy organ and brass group playing the theme and some fantastic editing of the notable Gerry Anderson FX cut with a teletype machine giving you facts about the SHADO organisation (well, it is British!) and the faces of the lead characters, finishing with the interceptors destroying a UFO right on beat!
But beyond that, the show itself was an interesting one. It's funny seeing it now, since we're much farther away from the futuristic year of 1980 than the people who made it were at the time! Cars with gullwing doors, guys (and even doctors!) wearing Nehru suits. And, of course, an established base on the Moon, (complete with girls in Nancy Sinatra white go-go boots, silver lam jumpsuits and pastel purple wigs!) to prevent evil aliens from invading.
It's clearly a late 60s view of the early 80s, and that makes this series fascinating enough and tacky enough to recommend on its own!
Beyond that, this DVD collection has a lot going for it. In addition to all of the episodes, carefully preserved by A&E, you get some bonus deleted scenes and/or other fx on each one of the eight disc collection.  And the stories themselves are intriguing as they are improbable, so that's pretty entertaining!
It may not be Gerry Anderson's most famous work (cult kids classic, ""The Thunderbirds"" and ""Space: 1999"" are sure to be better known), but I think it's the best of the bunch!
Highly Recommended.",1084406400,145,1499,4.787644787644788
