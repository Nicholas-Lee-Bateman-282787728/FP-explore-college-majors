8375146,5,B002NLXCWC,"Best movie EVER!  The score is a pefect match for the heroic adventures of Zorro, played by the one and only Dougie.  Zorro's alter ego, Don Diego performs some of the most awe-inspiring, eye-popping magic tricks you'll ever witness on film!  Hold onto your seats when Don Diego asks, ""Have you seen this one?""  A life-changing viewing experience for the whole family!!",1304640000,,369,4.903225806451613
