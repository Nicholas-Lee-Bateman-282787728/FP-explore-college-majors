8632454,3,B00HFG84KK,"This is the type of movie you know what the end scene is going to be as soon as it gets going.  Basic plot has a possessive controlling husband not liking the fact his wife is becoming independent after being encouraged by their neighbours that her artwork is really good and she should consider meeting up with people in advertising.  So he has her and her advertising employer killed.  He then sets out to have his vengeance against the couple next door for taking his wife away from him.  He's going to take everything away from the husband so he knows what it feels like.

Nicholas Brendon (Xander from Buffy) plays the murderer husband, and has certainly aged since those Buffy days. At first I thought this must be an old movie and I was watching Richard Kind in his early days as Brendon looks like a slightly thinner version of that actor and pretty much talks and has the mannerisms that Kind uses in Mad About You, Spin City and everything else he plays the same sort of character in. You probably didn't notice how bad Brendon's acting was back in the 90's due to being distracted by Sarah Michelle Geller jumping around in tight outfits but without that distraction, it's on display here.  At the start he's trying to convey he's upset by the murder of his wife to  his concerned neighbours, but it's coming across as I don't care she's dead.  For the character's plan to work he should have been coming across as emotionally in pain.

For the plot to work there's stuff that the characters should notice that they for some reason don't such as little cameras placed in the corner of the ceiling in one room and pretty obvious on a bookcase in another.  You've also got a setup for one of the parts of the revenge scheme occurring around an award for the female partner in the male neighbour's doctor surgery that he is convinced not to tell his wife about.  Surely he'd just invite his wife to the thing and avoid her freaking out since she'd be there.

Fans of Orphan Black may enjoy seeing a younger Natalie Lisinska who plays Gretchen, the murdered wife although she isn't in the film long at the beginning and only appears in a couple of flashbacks after that. If any of the other actors have starred in anything else, I certainly didn't recognise any of them.",1446595200,,2277,4.51338199513382
