8398150,1,B003JHXZJ4,Unwatchable - The audio and video are horrendous - I have lots of concert videos of various quality - this is the worst by far - I would never buy this item again,1383350400,4,162,3.9393939393939394
8398151,4,B003JHXZJ4,I have been a fan of guns n roses since the late 80's and collect gnr memorabilia so i was thrilled to get this. Anl's voice sounds great and the band put in a great show overall. My only disappointment is that the picture quality is not always the best. Whoever filmed this did not make use of the focus and the picture through some of the songs is very grainy. Especially at the begining of the concert. When it gets to welcome to the jungle all of a sudden the picture is clear. Go figure. That being said it is still a nice addition to any guns n roses fans collection. I only paid about 9 bucks for my copy so it was a decent price also.,1338854400,3,642,4.0234375
