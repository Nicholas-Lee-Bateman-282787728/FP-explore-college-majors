6290896,1,B00ISZNBCI,"I will not be buying this one for my niece and nephew. I don't care if Daphne realizes in the end that beauty is superficial. In fact, I could have applauded that.

But the fact the movie says she goes from a size 2 to a size 8 (oh horrors!) and--even worse, Daphne is shown MUCH larger than the ""dreaded"" size 8--is flat out fat shaming and perpetuates the promotion of unrealistic body types.",1408579200,17,394,4.324324324324325

6290899,3,B00ISZNBCI,"This is definitely not my favourite of the Scooby-Doo movies in recent years. The end was funny, and had the regular Scooby vibe but I'm honestly not so sure about the rest of it. It was quite a bit scarier I think than movies before it and the reason I love these movies so much is because of the cheesy, predictable, ""horror"" and this movie unfortunately didn't deliver. I don't think I'll be adding this to my collection anytime soon.",1408492800,,437,4.475
6290900,5,B00ISZNBCI,"My kids are huge Scooby Doo fans and I love it because I grew up on Scooby Doo! Its funny because they are both easily scared by movies so I would think shows all about ghosts would scare them but so far, Scooby Doo has been scare free. That is, until Franken Creepy came along!

Franken Creepy is a new original movie starring our favorite old characters. What I love about these new Scooby Doos is they look amazing thanks to todays advances in technology but without losing the look of the classic show. I had to read the movie cover again once we started watching because this could have passed for an older show. Once you get into it, its obvious its not with modern references and themes but still, as good as the classics.

There are a few parts where my son gets scared and leaves the room or hides behind me and closes his eyes if Im watching with him. But when asked if he wants me to turn it off he says no; he just doesnt want to watch the scary parts. So if you have a little one thats easily scared by me, be forewarned this ones a little bit more creepy than usual! The gang is trying to figure out a mystery as usual, this time involving the castle that Velma has inherited from a distant relative.

Expect all the usual twists and turns mixed in with silliness and laughter from the gang; all with a modern edge. Scooby Doo Franken Creepy is the new most over played movie in our house. I love that I can watch a show I grew up on with my kids. Its a little bit scary but still good, clean entertainment for the family.",1408406400,12,1536,4.1824324324324325
6290901,5,B00ISZNBCI,"I wasn't sure what to expect since the quality of Scooby-Doo direct-to-DVD releases can vary pretty widely.  On ""family movie night"" my kids (4 and 7) really wanted to rent this and I reluctantly (due to the price) agreed.  I actually enjoyed watching it quite a bit (which, as we all know, isn't always the case with kids' movies).

This definitely tweaks the standard Scooby format a bit and it seemed like a breath of fresh air in a semi-stale franchise to me.  It's high-tech and opens with Daphne doing a video webcast in which the rest of the gang interrupts.  The opening credit sequence is new and has a CSI-ish vibe to it.  The animation is darker but on-par with other recent favorites such as Legend of the Phantosaur.

The mystery is actually legitimate and isn't obvious from the start (like Scooby plots are prone to being).  There is enough danger and spookiness to keep kids entertained but nothing too scary or violent.  There is also enough slapstick humor to add levity to every scene.  If you are a family of Scooby fans, you will enjoy this movie.

<Semi-Spoiler Alert>I was worried about it promoting a negative body image for women based on another review about Daphne being turned in to a ""size 8"" and her freaking out about it.  I actually have to defend the writers here because Daphne realized she was being superficial throughout that story arc, it added to the story in a meaningful way (it allows her to evade iron face) and the most importantly: Fred didn't notice/care and said that she ""always looked good to him"".  I would say it was more about acceptance and not being superficial than anything.</Semi-Spoiler Alert>",1408320000,24,1651,4.710801393728223
6290902,3,B00ISZNBCI,"Its not my favorite Scooby movie, but it is good.  I'd say if you are a hardcore fan that enjoys the straight to DVD releases, its for you.  If you are just looking for something for the kids and family to enjoy, I'd wait and pick it up at a reduced price.  Since technically it hasn't been released yet and not everyone has had the chance to see it I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum.

First, the movie starts fast paced.  Everything is moving quickly, its bouncing back and forth...it created some anxiety for me that lasted throughout the whole movie.  The entire movie makes use of flashes between scenes, awkward pauses, and Family Guy style cut-scenes that I thought were very out of place for a Scooby movie and it really interrupted the flow making it hard to watch.  And apparently the gang has been broken up or something because they come back together to go visit Velma's family lawyer and they have a new Mystery Machine. I don't know, the entire opening seems jumbled.

I believe that this movie was supposed to be Halloween themed.  While no specific references are made, it is a little dark.  There are creepy characters (especially aboard the train).  The violence was also turned up a notch, a lot more explosions, close calls, Velma coming at Shaggy and Scooby with a chainsaw and axe, etc.  But nothing too scary for young ones, no one is hurt.  Just more action than Scooby has had in the past.

Overall, the writing is very good.  Its at heart a modification of the story of Frankenstein with a Scooby Doo plot twist.  There is plenty of comic relief, though it is a bit childish and cheesy.  The plot is complex compared to the usual bad guy/mask formula, I think they had an idea of what they wanted to do but just didn't execute it as well as they thought they could.  I think adults will pick up on the fact that this is a case of past villain revenge right from the start.  Its nice to get some back story on Velma and her family and to see each of the characters out of their element.  Basically, the pros outweigh the cons overall, it just didn't inspire the love that Camp Scare, Zombie Island, or Witch's Ghost did so I can't say its excellent.

On a side note, and I brought this up on Scoobyaddicts.com, one reviewer mentioned Daphne's weight gain.  1, she doesn't really gain the weight, and 2 no one is just flat out mean about it.  I was thinking they made her gain like 20lbs and everyone started in with fat jokes when I read the review.  The reviewer was concerned this could be damaging because of all the emphasis put on being happy with your body image but as a certified fitness trainer I think that the line between being comfortable with one's body and denying that you have an unhealthy weight problem is blurred.  Frankencreep addresses this aspect of the movie as best as it could and it is in no way offensive or damaging.",1408233600,12,2879,4.427756653992396
6290903,5,B00ISZNBCI,"The gang's at it again and things are not turning out the way they or we expect them in this fun filled, gothically well animated, full length latest and greatest, Scooby-Dooby-Doo frightfully funny fest.

Velma reluctantly inherits a Transylvania(PA) castle, and Fred laments the destruction of the Mystery Machine by an Iron Face lookalike.  The gang heads off via a spooky train to a spooky town full of torch carrying villagers and, an extra creepy castle with all the fixin's.

Yes, we're all familiar with this scenario, and it plays out for laughs and kid friendly spookiness as we: discover*MILD SPOILER ALERT* some family secrets about Velma's heritage, try to solve the mystery about the Monster and the ghost of Von Dinklestein; plus,why are all the gang members becoming different, polar opposites of their regular personalities, and will Daphne and Fred share
 a most unexpected kiss.*END ALERT*

The graphics, story, and setting are a lot of fun keeping in line with the old time monster movies, and there are a lot of gags that play into that theme as well teasing the Scooby-Doo characters. .  The beginning moves fast and unexpectantly, and you wonder where this is headed. It's not so much about solving the mystery as it is about watching our beloved characters play it out.

Our two elementary aged children give it a thumbs up.  Except for the poor Mystery Machine, this one was more goofy fun then threatening(like Camp Scare), even the Monster was made out animal parts rather than people parts.  Our kids only complaint- they wanted more focus on Scooby- isn't that the way it always is.  Here, each character, especially Velma must deal with their inner quirks, and it's , ""like"", all for laughs.

6290904,4,B00ISZNBCI,"I've been a life-long fan of Scooby Doo, and I always am incredibly excited when a new movie is released. This movie is full of the same humor and fun that all of the others have, but there was one motif that did make me uncomfortable - Daphne loses her beauty, and becomes a 'size eight.' It works within the plot, but I personally think her weight-gain was handled poorly (except by Fred - that was a good save!), especially in a time where body-positivity is of the utmost importance.
Overall, great Scooby movie - though I would recommend keeping it away from anyone who doesn't have enough self-confidence to be okay with not being a 'size 2' like Daphne.",1407974400,11,660,4.508333333333334

Although the overall plot was good, I gave this movie a 2 star rating because of what it did to ""The Gang"" In all the episodes/movies we have seen the background/family stories never line up, but the characters were still mostly true to themselves. The core personalities of Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby never really changed - until now.  In Frankencreep they seem to remove more of who the gang is as individuals which I did not much care for.  Of course there the whole dress issue with Daphne too.... that is clearly at least a size 18 not a size 8",1465603200,,657,4.512605042016807

My son loves how Scooby and Shaggy can overcome their fear and that the Mystery Gang always solves the mystery. While he watched I would ask him questions as to what he thinks the gang is doing and he would tell me his ideas. When I would ask why they would look for clues, who they are helping, and what they are trying to solve, he can tell me without any problems exactly what's been going on. Sometimes I ask what he would think the gang would do if they didn't find the clue and how he thinks the gang could solve the mystery. This would bring us to a whole what if's scenarios and turn it into a critical thinking exercise.

6290928,5,B00ISZNBCI,"Released in 2010, SCOOBY-DOO! FRANKENCREEPY is the twenty-second in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market. In this release, Velma learns she is heiress to the Von Dinkenstein estateand tells the gang that she is actually a descendent of the scientist who inspired Mary Shelly to write the novel FRANKENSTEIN.  Velma is uninterested in claiming the estate, but when the Mystery Machine is bombed as a warning to her not to pursue the matter, the gang insist that she go to Transylvania, Pennsylvania to avenge the vans destruction.

The gang soon discovers their meddling has unleashed the Von Dinkenstein curse: each one of them will lose the thing they love most and then be destroyed.  Fred has already lost the Mystery Machine.  Daphne goes from a size two a size eight (oh, the horror!) and beyond; Velma goes insane; and Shaggy and Scooby receive the worst blow of all: they lose their appetites!  Can the gang undo the curse, escape the Von Dinkenstein castle, and expose the criminals before it is too late?

No one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons, either old or new, of being great art, but the premise and characters (inspired, it is said, by the radio series I LOVE A MYSTERY and THE MANY LOVES OF DOBY GILLIS) are well-done and funand FRANKENCREEPY is very close to the best of the lot.  The story, which occasionally riffs on THE YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN,  is unexpectedly intricate, referencing the original Saturday morning series in an unexpected way; the adventures are surprising; and the ritual unmasking of the villains quite clever.  There are quite a few killjoys who claim Daphne's weight gain is unacceptable fat-shaming, but pay not attention to them.  FRANKENCREEPY is lots of fun for fans both old and new.

They enjoyed the movie, found it funny, and have asked to watch it again and again.  Yes there is a point where Daphne freaks out at becoming a size 8 but the point of the story is that the gang does not lose what they really treasure - each other.  My kids understood this and did not get hung up on Daphne's vanity.
I enjoyed the classic Scooby Doo as a child.  This movie brings back some of the bad guys from that series - amazing how no one ages.  I would say grab a cup of coffee and sit down and enjoy a silly movie with your kids. I gave it 5 stars based on everyone's reactions and enjoyment of the story.",1419811200,5,716,3.979020979020979

For those of us who grew up loving Scooby Doo, this film is the equivalent of sending the Pope a stripper.  Only the very beginning, and the very end, are worth viewer time.  My suggestion:  If viewers want ""quality"" Scooby Doo viewing, AVOID this disaster, as well as the stupid Scrappy Doo , and Scooby Dum, cartoons.

Seasons 1, 2, and 3, of the original series, will, always, be my favorites.  Praise be to them, and their creator:  Hanna-Barbera.

I only hope that future motion pictures will return to the series more simple roots.

Perhaps ""body-shaming"" is a strong term, but this was at best a VERY poorly thought out story-line.  In reading the reviews, there is a lot of discussion of the ""positive"" message of Fred not caring about how she looks, and the fact that she didn't actually gain weight but I think that's a crock.  After Fred says he didn't notice and she's always beautiful to him, he is shown struggling to get his arms around her ""size 8"" frame(specifically mentioned, but she was obese, so now kids have that connection in their heads).  The bottom line is, they all temporarily lose the most important thing to them (Shaggy and Scooby aren't hungry or scared, Velma loses her scientific mind, Fred loses his Mystery Machine) and Daphne loses her ""beauty"".  Kids aren't dumb.  They get the message that is being sent that the opposite of beauty=fat.  And according to WB apparently fat=size 8.",1415577600,4,978,4.618497109826589

We were sitting down to enjoy this movie like we have all the others until I heard the words I couldn't believe, words I was sure I had misunderstood because no writer, no productions studio would be stupid enough, yes I said it! They wouldn't be stupid enough to put those words in a movie geared towards adults let alone impressionable kids. But I had heard right. Yes, Daphne had uttered the words in horror ""I do not wear a size 8!!"" She had been cursed with the very worst fate imaginable to any human being -  oh the horror!! to be a size 8 with bad hair! Can you imagine? (And let me tell you the images that went with her being a size 8 were anything but. She was portrayed as incredibly obese. I encourage you to Google the images.) But wait it's okay because according to Warner Bro. ""The loss of Daphne's regular appearance is proven to be a superficial thing, and not what actually matters the most to her,"" Which might have been okay except they couldn't stop there and went on to say (silly people) that Daphne's weight curse also doesn't matter because her boyfriend Fred doesn't even notice, proving the weight gain makes no difference to him. Translation: It doesn't matter how much weight you gain as long as a man still finds you attractive! Tsk Tsk Tsk  I don't know about you but I've been teaching my kids to love themselves, to value themselves not for how they look or for how others look at them but for how they feel about themselves. I don't need Warner Bro. and Fred & Daphne undoing that.  I expected lighthearted fun and this wasn't it. Our copy went into the garbage so that their garbage didn't fill my daughter's head.",1410220800,9,1864,4.335243553008596
6291065,3,B00ISZNBCI,"Well, first let me say this is one of my least favorite movies. I enjoyed parts of it, but overall felt the 'freeze frame"" way of doing things VERY distracting, (i am not really sure how else to explain this technique). I did like the old city and the storyline idea was ok, I just felt it was not executed all that well. My kids (3 year old twins), have not requested to watch this again since the first time. They request most of the others several times. I will chime in on Daphne's weight issue: After the movie was over, I looked at my husband and asked what he thought. He mentioned that Daphne's weight issue was ridiculous, and should have been left out. I didn't want to seem ""over sensitive"" and be one of ""those"" parents who takes things so seriously. However, I truly was not happy about this. I feel at the very least, this part of the story was completely unnecessary. I feel like the writers have creative freedom for a reason and they could have gone about a million other ways with her storyline. Did weight really have to be part of it? And did they need to specifically say ""size 8""? I mean was that really necessary? We are talking about a target audience of children here....Also, SPOILER:she wasn't truly overweight in the end, and with a little deflation she was back to normal lickety split, no problem, which gives the wrong message too. Excess weight isn't always an easy fix. Even if Fred saved the day and Daphne realized it didn't matter if she was big or small, I think that was too little too late. My daughter had already mentioned Daphne being ""fat"" and she pretended to scream about it by that time. Not cool.  Let me say I am a normal sized 130lb mom,  and registered nurse with no axe to grind or drama to contribute. But as a mom with 2 small impressionable children, I was certainly shocked to see this in a Scooby movie. I love a lot of the other movies, but this one was just plain inappropriate and out of line in my opinion.",1410048000,13,1966,4.354223433242507

6291071,1,B00ISZNBCI,"We own tons of Scooby-Doo DVDs, from all the originals to the Laff-a-Lympics, Mystery Inc. to most of the movies. We greatly anticipate each one when it comes out (the only modern one we haven't seen is the Wrestlemania DVD).

When I watched this with my son (we had pre-ordered it here on AMZN, so no opportunity to read reviews), my jaw dropped. The story was SO lame, disjointed and boring--and the monster looked like bad animation from the 70s (animals cobbled together a la Frankenstein). It didn't look scary or original (like the monsters in, say, the Mystery Inc. series).

Pathetic.

And let me say something about the supposed ""fat shaming"" that some reviewers have mentioned. I'm a plus-sized gal who didn't see ANY fat-shaming in this DVD. Not ONCE did Daphne say ""I'm fat!"" or ""I'm huge!"". She said ""I'm hideous!""--and it was more from her poofed-out, frizzed hair and frumpy dirndl than anything! In fact, it ended up sending a valuable message to girls when she changed back to her stylish self and Fred says ""Huh? I didn't even notice. You're always beautiful to me!""

I don't know if the Scooby-Doo team got a new set of writers or what, but if future movies end up being this poorly constructed and executed--we'll just stop buying them.",1409529600,5,1256,4.7214611872146115
6291072,2,B00ISZNBCI,"This was not our favorite Scooby Doo. The art direction is somewhat distracting (particularly the heavy side lighting on all the characters) and there are these loud quick cut scenes that flash images on the screen that are pretty annoying. I've kind of gotten used to cartoons mixing unmatched 3d elements into scenes when motion is required, but I wish they would be more tasteful in how they do that.

6291073,5,B00ISZNBCI,"Not what I expected and I loved every minute of it. I have always wondered what happened to some of the villain's from past episodes and this twist was perfect. Did anyone notice how hot Velma was after she went crazy? she looked good and in order for her to be a size 2 like Daphne, Daphne had to gain weight, even though she was wearing an inflated suit and wig. I liked the character interaction between Velma and Shaggy, they are one of the most unlikely couples but the chemistry is just right, the threat of taking their brains though was odd. The mystery machine blowing up was a fresh and new idea and Fred's reaction lead to some of the great emotional moments of the movie. Just a great movie and perfect for Halloween.",1409356800,3,729,4.367647058823529

6291076,4,B00ISZNBCI,"The story opens with Daphne hosting an Internet program about the gang's past cases (and her modeling photos) when a mysterious man interrupts to say that he's a lawyer and that Velma has just inherited her great-great-uncle's estate.  Velma tries to convince the others that it's just a scam, but they insist that they visit the lawyer and find out.  Thus, they learn that Velma has been hiding some bizarre secrets about her family's history and that claiming her great-great-uncle's estate (a castle in Transylvania, Pennsylvania) leaves her vulnerable to a curse: that she and those closest to her will lose what they care about the most before they are destroyed.  The curse seems to come true almost immediately when her great-great-uncle's ghost destroys the Mystery Machine, leaving Fred devastated.  Nevertheless, the gang journeys onward to Transylvania (PA) to claim the castle and face down the curse as well as the hideous monster Velma's uncle apparently created: the Frankencreep!

This movie is different from most other Scooby-Doo movies.  As some people have said, it is darker than most.  Before it's over, the characters, as victims of the curse, act completely unlike themselves, even to the point where Velma threatens to take Shaggy and Scooby's brains for the monster.  A lot of reviews cite the scene where Daphne is suddenly overweight and is extremely upset as possibly ""body shaming"", but I took it more along the lines of how the curse was supposed to affect her: Daphne's good looks are as important to her as the Mystery Machine was to Fred, so anything that would spoil them (at least in her eyes) would be terrible.  However, as others have also said, (SPOILER ALERT!) she does realize that others (namely Fred) consider her beautiful anyway just because of who she is and that beauty isn't really the most important thing in the end.

IMPORTANT SPOILER ALERT!:
Most Scooby-Doo mysteries have a villain dressed up as a monster, but there are a few that have real monsters.  If, like me, you prefer the fake monsters to the real ones . . . you won't be disappointed.  The plot is clever and complicated.",1409097600,8,2135,4.9164345403899725

Watch the film , These reviewers are welcome to dislike a film, in fact it's their American right to do so, as it is mine to like this film. But to read so deeply into a cartoon that will one day warp girls' images? Worry about the music being catered to kids, the images that Victoria's Secret is selling, and so many other insidious forces. Scooby Doo, Freddy, Velma, and Daphne? They are still the good guys.

6291103,5,B00ISZNBCI,"This movie is SO MUCH FUN!!  I love it.  And after almost every recent Scooby-Doo movie I say the last one is my favorite.  The same goes for this one.  The animation is great, and it seems like the coloring has been changed slightly, it seems, and it looks more like Scooby-Doo Where Are You? and less like Zombie Island like they have been since 2010 and it works really well.
The plot is all sorts of crazy.  And it gives us some really great moments for character interaction, and it even gives us a reason why Mystery Inc. solves mysteries; or at least a reason why Velma does it, which works so well.
This movie also gives some context to the gang.  We discover what they mean to one another, as shown in a few scenes, and it's even shown that they will all accept each other for who they are.  Fred had some great moments too, concerning the Mystery Machine.
Also, there is a number of hilarious quick-cut sequences that are just awesome.  They had me laughing out loud every time.
The movie even has references and characters from the 1969 and 1976 series, as well as 2002's What's New Scooby-Doo (which would mean they're supposed to be in their 20's since that show follows the Zombie Island movie, and Daphne explicitly states they're teens, but who cares?) AND a reference to Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated in the form of, ""Crystal Cove,"" appearing on the Mystery Machine's license plate.  The attention to such things really makes the movie enjoyable.
All in all, this movie is great.  Buy it and watch it again and again to catch a reference you've missed.  It's the best Scooby-Doo movie yet.",1408838400,28,1609,4.571428571428571

I will say she said it's a bit scary which I found surprising as I watched it too and didn't notice any reaction like that.  But she's 8 and loves to talk up her Scooby movies.

6291108,1,B00ISZNBCI,"I was disgusted to learn that Warner Brothers has made a children's movie that demonizes fat people. There's been a huge backlash to this film, enough so that WB put out a response statement which reads:

""All of our content is run through Standards and Practices, and there is always sensitivity to obesity and self image, especially when it comes to programming made for children and a family audience. Although you are correct that Daphne becomes bigger in the course of the story, the message is actually a much more positive one. The plot of the movie involves the Scooby gang becoming cursed and losing what means the most to each of them. Fred loses the Mystery Machine, Shaggy and Scooby lose their appetites, etc. Daphne loses her good looks (mainly her figure and her hair). While Daphne is at first upset by the sudden change, there is a touching moment where Fred points out that he didn't even notice a change and that she always looks great to him. At the end, when Velma explains how they figured out the mystery, she points out that the curse actually DIDNT take away what means the most to each of them: their friendship. The loss of Daphnes regular appearance is proven to be a superficial thing, and not what actually matters the most to her.""

If this is WB's version of ""sensitivity to obesity and self-image,"" then I'd hate to see what their insensitivity looks like.

Considering the fact that the average age at which girls begin experiencing body dysmorphia is dropping every year, the whole thing sickens me. Please don't buy this movie.",1408665600,13,1563,4.717948717948718
6291109,1,B00ISZNBCI,"Fat shaming propaganda in a cartoon movie FOR CHILDREN---way to go!  I loved Scooby Doo---but the story line of Daphne gaining weight and it being a horror is simply irresponsible and not well thought out at all!!  Girls and women are bombarded by these messages constantly, it's really disappointing that these messages are in movies made for children!  Don't support this!",1408665600,12,374,5.098360655737705
6291110,1,B00ISZNBCI,"I would not recommend allowing little girls to watch this movie. It contains extremely disturbing messages about how women are supposed to look, and implies that any woman who gains a few extra pounds is ugly.
Each of the characters is cursed by losing what's most important to them, and to Daphne that's her ""good looks."" But instead of illustrating this by turning her into an ugly monster of some kind, they make her ""a size 8."" Oh, the horror! That's still three sizes smaller than the average American woman, but she's drawn more like a size 28. So let's feed little girls more completely unrealistic expectations about body size, shall we? And while we're at it, more nonsense about how not conforming to society's standards of beauty makes you some kind of freak or monster.
So what, it's just a movie, right? Except: kids are sponges, and they soak up the messages our media sends, both the intended and the unintended. Little girls as young as 5 are putting themselves on diets. A recent poll found that preteen girls are more afraid of becoming fat than of dying. 47% of girls in 5th-12th grade reported wanting to lose weight, 42% of 1st-3rd grade girls want to be thinner, and 81% of 10 year olds are afraid of being fat.
Do your children a favor and avoid exposing them to any more body-shaming messages like this.

6291111,4,B00ISZNBCI,"Everyones favorite canine mystery solver returns for his 22nd direct-to-video adventure with Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy. Youd think he and the Mystery Incorporated Gang would be ready to retire after such a long and satisfying career. However, they continue to make their way around the world in their trusty Mystery Machine seeking out one crime caper after the next.

Velma discovers shes inherited a cursed castle from her great-great uncle Doctor Von Dinkenstein. After much coaxing, the team talks her into claiming her birthright in Transylvania Pennsylvania. They arrive and discover the dark secret Velma has kept hidden from them all these years.

 Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy is presented in 1080p High-Definition (1.78:1) with DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio. Were provided with a clear and colorful picture that pops thanks to great digital quality. The surround sound puts us in the center of the action with all the quirky noise effects weve come to expect from these movies.

Special features for Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy consists of two bonus classic cartoons. A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts is from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! To Switch a Witch is included from The Scooby-Doo Show.

I was surprised at the new tone Director Paul McEvoy and Writer Jim Krieg took Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy in. Most of the direct-to-video entries in the franchise have the same feeling and look to them. Here we have very different camera angles (or whatever you call cinematography when its referred to in animation) being explored. Whether or not you like them, its still refreshing that the producers and filmmakers are trying to change things up a little.",1408665600,7,1645,5.287356321839081
