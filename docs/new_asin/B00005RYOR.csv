7952903,3,B00005RYOR,"I've been a fan of the band for 24 years now-am 43 at present-and thought this dvd would be icing on the cake of my vast Exploiteds material collection. Man was I right ! This is 2 VHS transfers onto one DVD.

The first one, RnR Outlaws is an hour long documentary on the band; interesting material in that it shows the band along their career,top of the pops presentation,extracts of several gigs with different lineups and material. Several of the interwied highlights the importance that The Exploited has gathered the bulk of their following outside the UK.So why on hell did the producer chose a narrator with such an awful cockney-londoner accent,who,to make things worse is mixed low in the bands loud racket ??!!Gary Bushell and the other interviewed are Ok,though. Picture quality sucks. The VHS used for the transfer was evidently in incredibly poor shape.

Now SEXUAL FAVOURS is a whole different story. A nice gig recorded somewhere in England in 87,,with the Death Before Dishonour lineup,plays an 11 song DEMOLISHING set including FOUR songs from their WAR NOW and JESUS IS DEAD Eps,which are never present on their live or recorded gigs. Picture and sound quality is are way better than on the other feature but exhibits cublocking and other compression artifacts. The gig + the Wattie interview snippets total 38' which along the LPCM audio and a pic bitrate that hovers around 5 Mbps does not leave enough room on the single-layer disc for a proper quality picture that should have been fixed 2.3 Mbps at best or have opted for lossy audio instead. There is a marked imbalance on the audio that makes the right channel sound way louder than the left.

A must have for any Exploited fan anyway.",1098057600,2,1710,4.7898305084745765
7952904,5,B00005RYOR,"For any punk fan, this is a must! The raw energy and aggression these guys dole out is insane. You may not understand what Wattie is saying in the interviews, but you definitly get the point. For anyone who says punk is dead, there wrong. Punks not dead.",1019174400,6,254,4.3125
