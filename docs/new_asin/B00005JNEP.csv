1521438,5,B00005JNEP,"I'm hoping those people brilliant enough to put ""Threshold"" and ""Roar"" on DVD get wind of the interest in this great series. This series was conceptually a masterpiece. It reminded me of wonderful movies like ""Tomb Raider"" and ""National Treasure"". The acting was superb, and the production values were amazing for a TV series. Everything from the directing to music was well crafted and only one thing was lacking, a studio without it's head up it's backside. Well I don't know the facts, but if it wasn't the studio, who was responsible for the shows cancellation? I understand that it actually was shown overseas even longer. We can only hope that the entire series is put on DVD since it is probably unlikely it will return to TV. I am hoping the SciFi channel will rerun it since when they reran ""Roar"" it was such a hit it came out on DVD a short time after.

This series is about a young man and his father that is a well known doctor with a background in many areas of research and science. His assistant was played by the intrigueing Arnold Vosloo, better known as ""The Mummy"". Their adventures in recovering artifacts and battling villains was intelligent nail-biting fun like we experienced in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Unfortuanately unless you recorded it or buy a poor copy on eBay you are probably out of luck in seeing this magnificent series. If you have any clue on who may own the rights and might be considering releasing it. Please let us know. I am hoping that Amazon will let them know there is a genuine interest in it and you can bet I will pre-order it as soon as Amazon offers it. In the meantime I guess I will go watch Jonny Quest.

I wrote this review just under two years ago and yet still no Veritas DVD. But you can bet we are still watching lots of Police, Forensics, and Reality shows on TV and they come out on DVD year after year. You can bet I won't buy them just as a point to the networks that I along with probably a million others are sick and tired of these shows and we want more intelligent shows like Veritas. Just like the Westerns burned us out 30 years ago, Police shows have now done the same. Get a clue networks unless you want to pay for your own ignorant idea of what is good.

1521439,5,B00005JNEP,"I absolutely LOVED that show! It was great! I have shows I watch, but only if I happen across them in my free time...I always stopped what I was doing to watch Veritas when it came on. Such a loss...fantastic show!",1160179200,,214,4.2439024390243905
1521440,5,B00005JNEP,"The greatest shows are ones that entertain you and make you think.  What I think is that the networks have a gift for cutting the best shows.  Veritas is definately an example of that.  The show had a great cast and an interesting dynamic between the characters.  I know by the second episode I was hooked, and excited about where the show would go.  It entertained me without the oh-so-common feeling of my brain sliding out of my ear due to disuse.  I love the Indiana Jones feel of the show and the sci-fi realism.  I really hope they come out with Veritas on dvd.  It would make my day.",1153440000,4,590,4.3
1521441,5,B00005JNEP,"Here's another example where the networks have their heads somewhere the sun doesn't shine.  This was the best, new action adventure program to hit the TV screen since the monopoly from Star Trek.  To me it was an interesting spin on the topic of Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider and the Relic Hunter programs/movies/games.  Well written with just enough reality to possibly be a real explanation for things of the past.

Don't know about the rest of you, but wish ABC would bring this back and make it into a series with life.  I'm sick and tired of all the ethnic shows, reality shows and have had my fill of CSI.  Give us a break and give us some good action and adventure that makes you think.  The Veritas Quest did that for me...  You don't have to have cops, rapists, court cases or ethnic stereotyping to make a good show.  And the reality shows are all bunk... and even they are going overboard now with the inventor, american idol, etc.

Its also the reason I rarely watch ABC...  All Bout Cash.",1145491200,15,999,4.464088397790055
1521442,5,B00005JNEP,"My mom and I used to watch this when it was on, and I thought it was good.  I was really disappointed when ABC cancelled it because the next episode looked really interesting.  I wished that ABC would've put the Iraqi coverage at another time, or ABC should have moved Veritas to another time.",1145059200,,293,4.407407407407407
1521443,5,B00005JNEP,"Myself, and many others were very disappointed when this series was cancelled and not given another chance by ABC television.  Well directed, and written with an Indiana Jones sense of wonder (and humor, I might add), this series deserves a revival.  It was well cast,  and left one wanting more with each passing episode. Mystery, suspense, and fine acting, especially from the talented and underused Arnold Vosloo will be sorely missed.  This show definitely deserves another shot.  Hope someone with some influence out there is paying attention!

Can't wait until it becomes available on DVD.  Another series called 'Miracles""  was shot down by the unfortunate timing of its release.",1118102400,24,686,5.229357798165138
1521444,5,B00005JNEP,"This was one of absolute favorites. It was like a small Indiana Jones. Great action and cast. Loved the show...too bad ABC doesn't ever give shows enough of a chance. They kept screwing with the schedule enough that it never caught on. I wondered why they spent so much time on promoting it if they weren't going to give it a chance. Personlly, I think I had a huge following, just from all the message boards and web sites that are out there.",1112140800,7,443,4.349397590361446
7940571,5,B00005JNEP,Simply put... Veritas translates to truth. The show aired on ABC owned by our esoteric friends at Disney. I certainly believe someone decided too much was being revealed to too many sheeple. This and Traveler being prematurely axed ended any chance of my household ever watching a show on ABC ever again (not like much time is wasted watching TV to begin with). I still wish this show would return. smh,1373068800,,402,4.676056338028169
7940572,5,B00005JNEP,"Veritas the Quest is a live action Jonny Quest.  The young boy (although teenage here), the scientist father, no mother, the mysterious bodyguard, flying all over the world, it's all there.",1323475200,,189,5.096774193548387
7940573,5,B00005JNEP,"A few weeks ago, I was going through my dvd collection, and Vertas: The Quest popped into my head, I have searched all over the net for the DVD release and guess what nothing!!
ABC need to get this back on track with another season, yes ok it has been a few years now, but if this had been released on dvd, they would have got better ratings, look at CSI, how many seasons now (I don't watch these).
It is a great shame that this show was cancelled after one season, I have been lucky though, as I have found this on the net, to watch, (so much I now know the scripts)and this brought back great memories.
The cast were fantastic and the story lines, believe it or not this has have taught a number of youngsters today to study in this field.
BRING IT BACK!!
Stop all these reality programmes.  A year later no one wants to know!!
I will keep watching on the net, and hope one day ABC come to their senses.

7940574,5,B00005JNEP,"This show is awesome,  But if course, ABC's infinite wisdom (note the sarcasm) canceled the series just when it was getting really good.  I loved this show and looked forward to it every Monday night.  But after 3 episodes it was pulled.  Ticked me off.

This show reminded me of Indiana Jones. This show, and Miracles which was aired and pulled at the same time, gave me a break from all the police dramas.  I am sick of police dramas.  It seems like every show on TV these days is either reality TV or a police drama.

I wish they would bring this out on DVD.  There is no excuse not to.",1226275200,2,589,4.1875
7940575,5,B00005JNEP,"This was one of the few tv series in which I was interested in enough to turn on the tv.  Nearly everytime it was scheduled, it was pulled to air more of the Bushwhacker's War.  I was totally disgusted since I haven't watched a series since Due South which was also dropped too soon.",1222128000,,283,4.222222222222222
7940576,5,B00005JNEP,"The show was sooooo good. I loved the characters, even if we only met them a few times. I want to find out how it went the entire mystery that surrounds the missing mom.  The hunt for whatever it was, all of it just give us some answers",1208563200,,236,3.9166666666666665
7940577,5,B00005JNEP,"Veritas, like many other shows that could have a huge following was a casualty of the station programmer(s) lack of forethought. - Not maintaining a schedule just to air news in a time slot not designated for said.

Each episode I had managed to see was in sequence, but missing a couple in between due to the lack of consistant program time. Further, it should not have been cancelled.

This was picking up on a take on the Illuminti and I really wanted to see how it would progress with the dynamic cast that was assembled.",1196899200,,525,4.458333333333333
7940578,5,B00005JNEP,"I can't really add anything more than what's already been said, but just want to add my name to the list of people who thought this was the most amazing show and would purchase it if it were released on DVD.",1187740800,,207,4.073170731707317
7940579,5,B00005JNEP,"I absolutely loved this show. It was one of the best on television. Even if I couldn't be there to see it, I would always make sure that someone taped it for me. To cancel was a travesty. Great acting. Great plots. Great everything! Networks need to understand two things. First of all, yes, police and medical procedures are interesting but not when there are hundreds of them on TV! After awhile people loose interest. Second of all, it takes time to build a fan base and when you keep jerking shows around(Threshold anyone?) it is a little hard to do. Pulling shows off right in the middle of something shows a complete and utter lack of respect both to the show and to its veiwers. Maybe if networks would listen, they wouldn't have people buy DVD's of the seasons as opposed to watching the actual show on TV.

Sadly Veritas was only the begining in what has now become a long line of Networks idiocy. Frankly they need to get a brain and realize we aren't all interested in police or medical shows. Esepically when there are hundreds of them on the air. I for one loved Veritas and have not before and since seen a show or even a movie that was remotely interesting. It renewed my interest in History and Archeaology. I haven't met any other show who has done THAT.",1173571200,6,1271,4.431623931623932
7940580,5,B00005JNEP,"I have found out that they made 13 episodes of Veritas, and I hate the fact that ABC cancelled the show. My son(20) and I are going to send emails to Sci-Fi requesting them to pick up the show, the same way they have done Dark Angel, John Doe, Firefly, Dead Like Me, the list goes on, all excellent shows that were cut down in their prime. Maybe if we send enough emails, they will pick up the rights and let us see the rest of the filmed adventures.",1163980800,,450,4.067415730337078
