Chris Jericho vs Maven - Maven who by this time has turned to a bad guy picks up the win and ic title thanks to help from simon the dieting guy.

John Cena vs Zues (carlitos bodyguard) - a falls count anywhere match. Zues picks up a shock victory. thanks to Kurt Angle.

Batista vs Randy Orton - Winner goes into Royal Rumble and if Orton wins he can face Triple H for the title. Orton wins with the rko.

WWE Championship The Undertaker vs Kurt Angle - The Undertaker retains after 2 tombstones and a last ride.

WH Title - Triple H vs Edge - a short match after triple H gets himself disqualified.

The Royal Rumble match - The Last 4 people are Big Show, Booker T, Randy Orton and Christian. Booker T is eliminated by Christian and randy orton eliminates Big Show then Triple H comes running down to the ring and pedigrees randy orton and just when randy is about to be thrown over the top rope by the game all the lights go out and on the big screen none other than The Rock appears on it and tells Triple H he has 5 seconds to leave the ring he doesnt and The Rock comes down to the ring and delivers The rockbottam to the game. but then Christina hits his finisher on randy orton and the rock but instead of eliminating Randy Orton , Christian nailed The bRock with several chair shot but then up rises Orton rko's Christian on the chair and then again on the mat and threw christian over the top rope tho get a shot at Triple H at Wrestlemania 21. the last picture of evolution is Orton stood over the game holding the title the possible ending at Wrestlemania 21. woooooooooo!!!!!!!!",1101772800,,1792,4.209912536443149
2194316,5,B0006SSNX2,"See my title for the review?  It's funny because there's only one Royal Rumble in any given year.  Ah, shut up.

Shawn Michaels vs Edge
Wow where was my head in this one?  Or rather, everyone else's?  All the other reviews here LOVED this match.  I... did not.  I thought it was high-energy, yes, but it was almost completely punches and kicks and clotheslines.  It did not amuse me and I was not entertained.  (5/10)

The Undertaker vs Heidenreich
Huh-HOHHHH!!!  What did you expect?  It was as terrible as you'd expect.  So terrible, it wasn't even really a match---Gene Snitsky, amateur abortionist, runs in to help beat on the Undertaker.  Then Kane appears inside the casket and runs him off so Undertaker can win.  Odd thought: what would have happened if the match weren't scripted, and one of them opened the casket early and found Kane there?  (0/10)

WWE Championship
John Bradshaw Layfield (C) vs Kurt Angle vs The Big Show
As my expectations were utter garbage, I was surprised by the match being entertaining and fun to watch play out.  The Big Show plays out being a monster giant with almost too much strength in performance---he almost never left his feet, and did almost nothing for most of the match until staying out for several minutes when being punched and keeling over through an announcer's table.  (7/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H (C) vs Randy Orton
OH HEY!  This is the exact same main event lineup we're being treated to ad nauseum TODAY!  Haha.  And yet it's somehow worse now than it was back then (ie, the time of this DVD) because I cannot remember anything overtly bad about this match except Orton looked pathetically weak.  (6/10)

Royal Rumble Match
A very good and entertaining one.  Some angry bits: Jonathan Coachman enters as a JOKE entry so that a deserving athlete can NOT be featured.  Who in the blue hell thinks LUTHER REIGNS or MARK JINDRAK or SCOTTY 2 HOTTY even had a chance of winning the Rumble?  It's not the fact that they're clearly not main eventers, but the fact that it was mentioned many times by the commentators that they could end up headlining Wrestlemania.  DOWNPLAY THAT, TAZZ!  The ending was fun with the controversy, but the restarting was rather lame.  Especially with how easily Batista just threw Cena out of the ring.  (9/10)

That was it, and this is the review.",1241222400,,2347,4.716049382716049
2194317,4,B0006SSNX2,"Royal Rumble began the road to Wrestlemania 21 and this certainly ended and started some rivalries leading up to WM 21. All the matches are good. There wasn't any duds and the Rumble was very good too.

1. Shawn Michaels vs. Edge
This match was very good which had a four month build up to it. It all started at Taboo Tuesday with Shawn getting more votes than Edge. It started out with a pretty good fight. Really going back and forth with some good reversals. It had some brief action to take place on the outside once Edge tryed to get counted out. The ending came out of nowhere. Great opener. 4/5

2. Casket Match
Undertaker vs. Heidenreich
Very good casket match. I was very impressed by this one as I was when these two faced off at the Survivor Series. It started with some semibrawling. The casket would briefly get used. Kane and Snitsky would get involved and would fight out into the crowd. Undertaker would then unleash some hard punishment onto Heidenreich. Good way to end this feud. 4/5

3. WWE Title
Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show
This match had a pretty good storyline leading into it. It has some good action on the outside where Show speared JBL through the barricade. It had a good table spot too. JBL and Angle had a pretty good one on one confrontation. The ending was totally JBL style but it fitted in good. 3.5/5

4. World Heavyweight Title
Randy Orton vs. Triple H
This was another match that had a four month build up to it. Randy and Triple H have pretty good chemistry in the ring together and they can put on some good wrestling clinics and this was no exception. I wouldn't say this match was better than their Unforgiven bout but it was just different. Orton was the agressor and just giving it to Hunter in the early going. Neither man had the advantage for too long. Both men pulled out some good counters and got in some hard shots onto each other. Orton got a little dazed towards the end which was his downfall. Very solid title match. 5/5

5. Royal Rumble Match
The Rumble Match 2005 had some very good highlights to it. It began one of the best wrestling feuds of the year and it also began the era of the Animal.

Benoit and Eddie started it off with a good back and forth wrestling match up. It had some good action before Angle and HBK entered but it really got going once they entered. Angle came out very energitic and farce. The true highlight of the match was defiantly the outside brawling between HBK and Angle. It had a good final four. This is also the first time where Cena and Batista went face to face with each other. Watch for Vince injurying himself in trying to enter the ring. Good rumble. 4.5/5

Royal Rumble was a pretty good event. I recommend on checking this one out.",1218931200,,2732,4.3767258382643
2194318,3,B0006SSNX2,"Edge VS HBK: I liked this feud. Really good way to open the show.

Undertaker VS Heidenreich in a Casket Match: A decent match, nothing really speical. Typical Undertaker match/feud.

JBL VS Kurt Angle VS Big Show: Why give them only 15 minutes? Excellent triangle match. Back in 2005, Smackdown had some of the best wrestlers in the world. Maybe the match of the whole show.

Triple H VS Randy Orton: Who cares? Orton was a babyface and not kicking everyone in the head. This match was longer then the Smackdown title match and could have been shorter. Triple H was on a power trip when this match took place.

Royal Rumble: As I searched for what to watch, I could not remember who won this Rumble. It was probably the worst Rumble since 96. The start saw Beniot, Holly, and Guerrero beat the hell out of Daniel Puder and throw him out. I fell asleep during some of it but nothing really happened out of the ordinary. Worst Rumble since 96 as I said before.

Thoughts: WWE has losts its luster during the internet age and the end of WCW. The PPVs rarely produce a feeling of your watching something speical. The 2002 Rumble had alot of wrestlers coming back and I enjoyed that. This year was plain and predictable. Its been that way ever since really. A few good matches but the Rumble sucked.",1204848000,,1295,4.470338983050848

1. Edge vs Shawn Michaels

This was a great opener, with two talented wrestlers. This match happened because of Michaels kicking Edge at NYR 05. Very Good spots and and bad ending with Edge using the ropes for the win. (8/10)

2. Casket Match

Undertaker vs Heidenreich

This was a boring match at the beginning, and it got better with the intervention from Snitsky and Kane. The fact that it was a gimmick match saved this from beign a bad match. (5/10)

3. WWE Championship (Triple Threat, No DQ)

I was expecting a better match but it was a solid match. Triple H dominated most of the match and whenever Orton built momentum, Hunter stopped him. Nice ending with Randy' ""concussion"". (8/10)

5. Royal Rumble Match

This was a great match. There was no surprise appearances like Drew Carey in 2001, but it was good. I think Benoit and Eddie deserved the victory. Controversial ending almost similar to the one of Bret Hart/Lex Luger on 1994, but this time the match was re-started and Batista won. (10/10)

Overall nice PPV, think it deserves the buy, even though i paid $1 to rent it. Very good PPV.",1161993600,,1476,4.583969465648855
2194321,4,B0006SSNX2,"This Rumble was a great PPV from top to bottom with a solid card from top to bottom along with very entertaining backstage skits.  The only critism I have with what everyone else said, alot of the results were very predictable.

Shawn Michaels vs. Edge - Boy, they knew how to kick this PPV off in style with these two as Edge has proven that he can hold his own & Shawn Michaels in one of the best in-ring performers.  Highly solid opener.

Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Heidenrich - Just like Mark Henry at WM22, this being a ""gimmick match"" made it better than their previous encounters.  The entertaining cameos by Snitsky & Kane helped the match as well & teased a tag match for WM21 (which thank god they didn't do)

WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle - Great triple threat match showing each man's strenghts.

World Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton - Another solid match between these two one-on-one.  Again, the ending to this match was very predictable.

Royal Rumble match: This was one of the best in a while with a lot of side moments in this one such as Muhammed Hassan's time in the Rumble, the interaction between Angle & HBK, and Vince McMahon injuring himself while entering the ring at the end.

One backstage segment worth mentioning was Eddie Guerrero & Ric Flair drew their Rumble numbers only to have Eddie ""steal"" Flair's number.

DVD extras included Cena & Batista in the ring after the Rumble, a J.B.L. interview from RAW the next night, Teddy Long offering Batista a SmackDown WM main event contract, and Royal Rumble highlights from the previous years.  Unfortually, they didn't have the funny ""West Side Story"" musical Rumble commerical.

This one one DVD that should be added to your collection.",1150502400,2,1737,4.6743421052631575
2194322,5,B0006SSNX2,"This was a good and entertaining Royal Rumble. Filled With good matches and funnys segments during the show. Heres a rundown of the matches. I will rate the match and the replay value of the match being that replay value is important to me when buying a movie because it is a good indicator of if it will be worth my money. This is my review of the 2005 Royal Rumble.

1)Edge vs Shawn Michaels.

I love watching Shawn Michaels in the ring and Edge is one of my favorite wrestlers. MATCH:7/10

REPLAY VALUE:6/10, worth another look

2)The Undertaker vs Heidenreich, Casket Match

This match was Decent and entertaining with the involvement of Kane and Snitsky. MATCH:6/10  REPLAY VALUE:4/10, If you like Undertaker then this should be worth another look, but I am sure I won't be giving this a peak for awhile.

3)JBL vs Kurt Angle vs The Big Show WWE Championship

I usually like Triple Threat matches and this is no exception. This is my second favorite match on the card behind the Rumble. Each man gets to show his stuff. JBL gets driven through the barricade by The Big Show at one point. MATCH:10/10

REPLAY VALUE: 10/10, this is just my opinion on the match, but this is a match i could give two or three more looks

4)Triple H vs Randy Orton World Heavyweight Championship

Randy Orton is my favorite wrestler of today and Triple H is usually fu n to watch in the ring. This match goes from Randy Orton getting a quick start offensively to Triple H working Orton's leg, to Randy fighting back. Orton suffers a concussuion in the match, and though I don't like seeing someone getting hurt, it does add to the match. MATCH:9/10

REPLAY VALUE:8/10, this was just as entertaining as the triple threat match and is worth watching a couple of more times.

2005 Royal Rumble Match

This was a fun and funny Royal Rumble with a cocky Danielle Puder being talen to the woodshed by some of the veterans. At one point the Raw and Smackdown wrestlers take sides with their respective brands in a little RAW vs SMACKDOWN showdown. At one point all the superstars jump Muhamud Hussan. MATCH:10/10

REPLAY VALUE:10/10, I like the Royal Rumble style match and this is a very entertaining one. Match of the night.

In the end, the 2005 Royal Rumble is worth buying. With a good undercard,some funny backstage segments in between matches, and a good Rumble match, this DVD is well worth the price AMAZON.com is selling it for.

PPV: 8/10  REPLAY VALUE:9/10",1150329600,3,2445,4.607390300230947
2194323,4,B0006SSNX2,"1. Shawn Michaels vs. Edge
Great opener, Michaels is a tremendous performer and one of the best the business has ever seen. Edge is also one of if not the best heel in the business today, and they produce an excellent match together. The ending feels a little cheap, but its forgivable since its a great match. 8/10

2. Casket Match: Heidenreich vs. The Undertaker
Wasn't expecting too much from this one, but I was pleasantly suprised. Fufilled its purpose by effectively ending their fued. 'Taker makes Heidenreich look halfway decent in this match, and the Deadman himself puts on a good performance, as always. Good effort, this match is definitely worth watching. 7.5/10

3. Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: JBL (c) vs. The Big Show vs. Kurt Angle
I expected this to be slow and boring, but boy was I wrong. This is fast paced and exciting from the get-go, and all three men give it their all to make this a great title bout. A couple nice spots, but a rather annoying ending. Good match overall though, very entertaining. 8/10

4. World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (c) vs. Randy Orton
Not as good as their match from Unforgiven 2004, but still a very good title match. These two mix well together. Triple H can put on an excellent match when he so desires, but can look very lazy too (see: all of 2003). Thankfully he makes this one exciting and puts on a good performance. Randy Orton also does well in this one, and proves why he deserves to be in the title hunt. It's predictable, but still a great title match. 8/10

5. Royal Rumble Match
One of the best Rumbles in years. 2004's Rumble was also very good, but I think this one is significantly better. A great roster for this one, and people like Jericho, Edge, and Benoit spend a large amount of time in the match. Excellent match, everybody contributes a lot to this one. A couple very cool eliminations, and a great final two that has the entire crowd on their feet. They go nuts for these two, which makes it all the more exciting. Don't miss this. 8.75/10

The Royal Rumble Pay-Per-Views tend to have an awful undercard, but a pretty strong uppercard and Rumble match. However, this entire undercard is good, and there is not a single weak match at the whole event. Its worth watching the entire way through, which is not something that can be said for most cards. Excellent title bouts, excellent rumble, and good fued matches make this one of the best events of 2005.

Match of the Night: The Royal Rumble match. How a Royal Rumble should be, saving the best for last. An excellent roster and great performances by all involved make this the best Rumble match in years.",1148169600,,2663,4.572327044025157

2194325,4,B0006SSNX2,"Well, I just recently purchased this particular DVD. I was a little skeptical about buying it again. @ first, several months ago, I purchased it, but I traded it back because I didn't like the commentary in the Royal Rumble (I know that should be an issue). So, @ this particular time, I've purchased this DVD again. With this review, lets see if a couple of months of time have been kind to this event. Here's my review:

Shawn Michaels vs. Edge (During the initial buildup to this match, I thought this was going to be a classic. After viewing this match, I was somewhat disappointed, but that's *not* a knock on this match @ all. The slow portion in the middle of the match kind of deducts points away from the rating, but the rest of the match was pretty solid.)***

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich, Casket Match (I wasn't thrilled with this storyline, but I've been a fan of the Undertaker for years. Not a horrible match, but what you see is what you get. And anyone who's been watching the Undertaker during his career should know the outcome.)*1/2

Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. The Big Show, WWE Title (Wow. Surprisingly, this match was *too short*. It seems they were getting into the groove around the time when Big Show clotheslined JBL through the ringside barricade. Everyone, including JBL and Big Show, had their working boots on, and the result was a pretty good match.)***1/2

HHH vs. Randy Orton, World Heavyweight Title (Man, did this match just lumber around with no flow. Everyone kind of knew that HHH was going to win this one, with Orton's original push flopping badly. They could've turned it up on this one, but it turned out to be merely average this time around.)**

The 2005 Royal Rumble match (Wow, if there was ever a match that I shortchanged, this was it. This was an excellent Rumble match, with great performances from the WWE superstars. After listening to JR and Tazz's commentary, who by the way make a fine play by play duo, it wasn't all that bad like I previously thought. There were some fine moments in this Rumble, such as the Benoit/Eddie moments, Holly, Benoit, and Eddie showing Puder what paying dues is all about, Batista's domination, Paul London's bump of the night, etc.)****

Overall, what can I say? I did shortchange this event @ first, but after viewing it a little more objectively than I did other events, it's a pretty good show. You have a solid Michaels/Edge match, a pretty good Angle/JBL/Big Show match, and an excellent Royal Rumble match. Recommended.",1143417600,,2505,4.681818181818182
2194326,4,B0006SSNX2,"Edge vs. HBK

A relatively long match that was good to start the show with. Some good counter moves from these men. However it did suffer with a few pretty boring minutes that hindered the overall quality.

RATING: 80/100

Heidenreich vs. Undertaker

A good match. Very happy that Undertaker won and not Heidenreich, as the latter with a victory in this match would have been truly pathetic booking. Unfortunately the no-dq rule that goes with casket matches was only exploited with interferences and not with good weapon use.

Still very solid enjoyable match.

RATING: 83/100

Big Show vs. JBL vs. Angle

Disappointing WWE Title match (first main event). Nothing exceptional here and possibly one of the worst triple threat matches on PPV I have seen period.

RATING: 67/100

Orton vs. HHH

I was expecting a lot more out of this match and a lot better counter wrestling with close kickouts and nearfalls. I was disappointed that this match failed to deliver on that. It was still a good match that was solid all the way through however.

RATING: 78/100

Royal Rumble

Good Royal Rumble match that met the standards of the past but didn't really set new standards. Controversial ending added interest. Very enjoyable, good match.

RATING: 86/100

78% - Very good PPV that was extremely solid the whole way through. Scored highly because of no horrific matches. Great start on the road to Wrestlemania.",1140307200,2,1403,4.906382978723404
2194327,4,B0006SSNX2,"The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble was one of the best in recent memory. The Rumble match itself was great, and the undercard didn't have a single weak spot.

Shawn Michaels v. Edge

We all know what Shawn Michaels is capable of, and when you put Edge in a match with a talented guy, you're going to see a very good much. All Shawn Michaels matches are kind've similar but nonetheless this match was a fun watch and a great way to kick off the show.

Undertaker v. John Heidenreich in a Casket Match

Although not a bad match, this was certainly the weakest match on the card, probably saved only by the fact that it was a gimmick match. Heidenreich is a mediocre wrestler, and the Undertaker isn't quite the presence he once was. But this was a very violent match and fairly enjoyable to watch.

JBL (C) v. Big Show v. Kurt Angle

I always find triple threat matches to hold alot of excitement, and Kurt Angle almost always puts on a very good match. Granted, neither the Big Show nor JBL are especially good wrestlers, Angle carried them through a respectable match, with, albiet, a predictable ending.

Triple H (C) v. Randy Orton

This was another solid match with a predictable outcome. For all the complaints about it, Triple H is still one of the best wrestlers in the business and Randy Orton looks great when he works with someone talented. Not much to complain about here except for the predictability.

2005 Royal Rumble Match

The main event was one of the best Royal Rumble's in recent times, featuring some humorous moments, alot of great wrestling but unfortunately a predictable ending (notice the theme here?). The match started out great with Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero, and Rey Mysterio and Edge carrying the Final Four. Once the match got down to Batista and John Cena it got a little dull, as Cena only looks good with an exceptional wrestler, and Batista is good, but not amazing.

Overall, this was a very good event. If you're looking for surprises, though, this isn't the Royal Rumble for you. Every match except maybe the Michaels-Edge match was easily predicted. Despite this, there was alot of excitement, and this is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of the Royal Rumble.",1139356800,16,2221,4.64030612244898

match two: Undertaker vs. heidenreich

  I liked this match, cause i personally enjoyed this rivalry, i mean they could off picked someone with more experience to do all this to taker and cause this match to happen, but putting a random phsyco path in this all works for me.  Anyway snitsky interfering was pretty pointless butt entertaining especially when kane came in.

match three: World heavyweight title Orton vs. Triple H

 Of course Triple H had to wins this. He wins everything!!!.  it was a pretty good match.  Pretty even with some good moves by both.  Unlike at unforgive 2004 triple h didn't need evolutin.  Instead orton suffered a concusion.

  this match was pleasing.  Of course big show was dominate as he had been all the way leading up to this match since the time of his return.  It could of been longer, and bloodier, but it was pleasing

  jbl retains (with much help from his cabnit)  7.5/10

match five: Royal Rumble

  Ok, i really liked this.  Rumbles are almost always interesting and i like how benoit and eddie worked together, of course, of course eddie tried some underhanded tactics, but they both lasted throughout most of the rumble, plus rey did quit well.  I liked how cena and batista both got eliminated and they had to restart it.  I wish cena could of wone, but batista is great too.

2194331,5,B0006SSNX2,"At finally from past Royal Rumble PPV to today, this royal rumble 2005 are better of all. Here order of my favorite matches.

1) Triple Threat Match for WWE Champiopn: JBL vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle. That's good match with Big Show. Big Show was wrestle as well with JBL and Kurt Angle. At end, JBL was winner by help of Danny, Doug, & Orlands. Big Show was pissed off, Teddy Long make a match at No Way Out, Barred Wire Steel Cage JBL vs. Big Show for WWE Champion.

Winner: JBL

Rating: 10/10

2) Casket Match The Undertaker vs. Herdenreich: Umm... That's good but it's shouder be better. There was no weapson expect casket. That was pretty good short match at only 10 minutes. At end, Gene Stnisty was help Herdenreich but kane was show up to kick Gene Stnisty out of the ring. I thought Kane hate Undertaker but not.

Winner: The Undertaker

Rating: 8/10

3) Royal Rumble Match the Winner will takes a shot title at wrestlemania 21. At sometimes at royal rumble have funny parts.

That's good to watch this match. At end, Batista and John Cena were messed up by out of the ring at same time.

Winner: Batista

Rating: 9.5/10

4) World Heavyweight Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton: this match wasn't bad if Randy Orton have not hurt on knee. Triple H make Randy Orton to be give up. At end, Triple H was beat Randy Orton with cheat!

Winner: Triple H

Rating: 8.5/10

5) Shawn Michaels vs. Edge: that's not main events at night. They wrestle to beat who is best man. That's dumb storylines of between HBK and Edge. Edge was boring wrestle in WWE. HBK and Edge are different wrestle techology. That cause match's rating going low. Be cool to watch this match.

Winner: Edge

2194333,3,B0006SSNX2,"This Royal Rumble wasn't to bad. Heres my match reviews

Shawn Micheals vs. Edge- Wow, this was a great match. I didn't think it would but it did. It lasted too long for an opener. I just hated the ending where Edge had to cheat to win. Winner- Edge.

The Casket match- This was pretty cool too. I thought it would be better. It was funny when the two RAW guys came in like Kane and Snitskey. I was happy when Taker won. Winner- Undertaker

JBL vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle- Hhhhmmmm. I didn't seem to like this match to much. To many people ran into this match. I hated the fact JBL won. But he loses the belt a WM21.

Triple H vs. Randy Orton- Best match of the night. I know HHH was heel in here, but I wanted him to kick Orton's ass. Orton doesn't deserve to be the Heavy Weight Champ because he's too skinny. I mean look at Chris Benoit, sure he was small but he was buffer than Orton. HHH should have used the hammer on Orton. But I'm glad HHH won.

The Royal Rumble- This was a cool Royal Rumble. It's funny, that guy from Tough Enough Danial Puder just joins the WWE after all that he went thourgh, but after the PPV he leaves, want an idiot.  When Snitskey hits Paul London, that was cool and painful, I'm glad he came back in only a few weeks. I don't know why people hate the fact Batsita won, I was happy when he won. It's cool to after the match, he and John Cena (who was out last) shook hands after all that. This PPV was good but it could have been better.",1130112000,,1471,4.037800687285223

1. HBK VS Edge

4. RKO VS HHH WORLD TITLE
i thought this was going 2 top un4given i was so da*n wrong this suck started off good until HHH's chop block he keeps slowing down matches doing that then it gets even worst when randy gets a fake concussion come up with something better let him beat him fair or a rollup or something 5/10

2194336,4,B0006SSNX2,"I won't bore you with a wordy introduction! Let's get to the card:

Shawn Michaels Vs. Edge - Pretty good opener. I actually liked the mocking done by Edge at various times (especially when he faked the Sweet Chin Music and used his spear tackle instead)! Most knocked the ending but it was very basic and old school and very keeping into the desperate persona of Edge.

Undertaker Vs. Heidenreich (Casket Match) - Probably the worst bout on the card but even The Undertaker can't help this guy! Only exciting part is when Gene Snitzky and Kane got involved!

JBL Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. The Big Show (Triple Threat WWE Title Match) - Was better than I thought it would be! All three men actually put in a good effort. Could've lived without the interference for both Angle and JBL though! Still, a good match.

HHH Vs. Randy Orton (World Heavyweight Title Match) - Having HHH come down alone (barring Batista and Ric Flair) was a good call. I actually don't mind cheating from the wrestlers as long as its THEIR cheating!

Anyway, HHH practically handed Orton his a** in this one! Except for a few moments in the bout, Orton never really got on track here! While I am not a HHH fan, I HATE ORTON EVEN MORE! So, I was actually happy to see ""The Game"" win this one!

THE ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH - While not as dramatic as the previous year (where Chris Benoit went over an hour to win), it still was a pretty good Rumble match! The best parts of the whole thing was seeing Daniel Puder practically get whooped by Benoit, Gurrerro and ""Hardcore"" Holly, the RAW/Smackdown face off, seeing the RAW/Smackdown guys come together to stomp the stuffings out of Hassan and the beginnings of the Kurt Angle/Shawn Michaels rivary! Batista winning the Rumble wasn't that much of a surprise as everyone knew that either him or John Cena was going to take it!

I should also know this was also the real beginning of the Christian/Cena war during The Rumble drawings that are shown on this DVD. Also an interesting bonus is seeing Batista and Cena sort of face off after the conclusion of The Rumble.

Overall, a good buy.",1128124800,,2097,4.529100529100529
2194337,5,B0006SSNX2,"All matches scores are decided on a scale from 1 to 10

1) Edge vs. Shawn Michaels-8- I give Edge a lot of credit, for a heel, he can wrestle. Most heels cheat too often, but Edge, even though cheating for the win by grabbing the ropes, really gives impressive matches. This match with Shawn Michaels was impressive, great way to open the Royal Rumble, Shawn Michaels is just ageless.

2) Casket Match-Undertaker vs. Heidenreich-6.5

I'm not a big fan of Casket matches, mainly because they have a habit of running a bit on the slow side, and i was really expecting that again, but this was very impressive. Heidenreich might be over the top in his acting but really gave a great performance, same to the Undertaker. If it was for Kane and Snitsky getting involved, this would have been better.

3) WWE Championship-Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show-8.5

i really liked this match, it had a great pace, there are some slow parts in this match but they don't really matter in this match. I'm a little disappointed with the winner, seeing JBL as the champion and the constant ""WRESTLING GOD"" crap is getting on my nerves

4) World Heavyweight Championship-Triple H vs. Randy Orton-10

People who didn't like this match or found it boring, i feel are people that don't like straight clean matches. If i had to say one thing that the new generations of fans have missed a lot on is straight wrestling, if there is no weapons or these damn suicide moves, fans get turned off. Triple H and Randy Orton did a great job. The concussion was a little retarded, but it was nice seeing a clean victory by Triple H, he brought out the Sledge but didn't use it.

5) Royal Rumble 2005-9.5

Well, what can i say, 30 great superstars fighting for a chance to main event at Wrestlemania. Vince Mcmahon, twisting his ankle on the way to the ring, you can tell Batista and John Cena tried their best to keep from laughing. Even Vince Mcmahon looked like he was trying not to laugh. Overall, some good moments are when Rey Mysterio enters, i would of loved to see Mysterio win, i think he deserves it at least one time. Batista wins, in probably the best Royal Rumble to date, still i don't mind people fast forwarding though a couple of parts because it is over an hour, so watching the whole thing is almost impossible.

Best Segment- Ric Flair and Eddie Guerrero put on one of the funniest segments i've seen in years, Eddie Guerrero steals his number then Ric finds out he stole his wallet as well. That was hilarious, also Batista and Triple H's rivalry gets a boost as well in this event.

Overall- 9/10- Definitely a must see for wrestling fans.",1124323200,,2629,4.5021008403361344

1. Shawn Michaels vs. Edge

Of course HBK was in this match so you new it was going to be pretty good and it was. He was robbed by Edge after he rolled up Shawn for the win using the ropes. 8/10

2. The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich in a Casket Match

Better than expected. Best part was when Kane came out of the casket to fight off Snitsky who was helping Heidenreich. Taker' wins. 7/10

3. JBL vs. The Big Show vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship.

Match was pretty good but the ending sucked. JBL got speared through the security wall by Big Show. But of course JBL gets interference to help him win. JBL's title matches were getting way to predictable and his title reign is way too stale.

4. Triple H vs. Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Title.

This was alot better title match because it didn't have any inteference. Orton suffers what looks like a concusion and Triple H  wins. 7/10

5. Royal Rumble Match

Not as good as last years Rumble but still good. Lots of guys from both brands who could win. Lots of high spots like the RAW superstars vs. the Smackdown superstars. Then they all teamed up to take out Muhammad Hassan. Kurt Angle who was not originaly entered stole Nunzio's number and entered but was quickly eliminated by Shawn Michaels. After that Angle eliminated HBK and hit him with the stairs causing him to bleed. This set up there Wrestlemania 21 match. Snitsky close-lined Paul London off the aprpon causing London to do a complete flip before landing. It was a wicked bump. End the end Batista and John Cena went over at the same time and both were declared winners. Thankfully Mr. McMahon restarted the match and Batista eliminated Cena to win.

2194340,4,B0006SSNX2,"This was one of the best Royal Rumbles in the last 5 years or so. I was really impressed by most of the matches.

Edge vs HBK

This was a pretty good match, excellent for an opener. Both men put on a great show. Edge wins it by rolling HBK up and holding his tights. It was a good match, but it would have meant a lot more if Edge had won cleanly.

Winner: Edge

Score: 8/10

Casket Match: Heidenreich vs Undertaker

This was one of the few Casket Matches I have seen and by far the best. 'Taker, of course, did his hour-long entrance.... Match starts off with 'Taker dominating, and drags Heidenreich to the casket, scaring the crap out of him. 'Taker had a lot of good spots in this match, including a VERY painful loooking guiltine leg drop. Snitsky eventually comes out to aid Heidenreich, and as they were about to throw Undertaker in, Kane popped out. Kane cleaned house and took Snitsky back stage. Heidenreich then smashes Taker between the ring and the casket. Later, 'Taker Tombstone Piledrives heidenreich and rolls him in the casket for victory.

Winner: Undertaker

Score: 8/10

Three Way Dance for the WWE Title: JBL (c) w/ Cabinet vs Angle w/ Reigns and Jindrak vs Big Show

A very good match, much better than the Heavy Weight Championship Match(see below). It starts off with Show and JBL wrestling, while Kurt smartly leaves the ring. Big Show destroys JBL and goes for the pin, but Angle breaks it up. Later on, JBL and Angle teamed up and knocked Big Show right through the SD! anounce table. Angle and JBL wrestle one on one for a while.... Big Show finally recovers after about five minutes and tackles JBL right through the guard rail, and JBL is out cold!  Big Show enters the ring and Angle tries to hit him with a chair, but gets it knocked back in his face. Show dominates Angle for a while before delivering the Chokeslam, but Reigns and Jindrak Pull the ref out before the three count! They then battle Show up the entrance ramp, as OJ pushes JBL into the ring, and JBL nails Angle with the Clothse Line From Hell for the victory!

Winner: JBL

Score: 8.5/10

World Heavy Weight Title Match: HHH(c) vs Orton.

Not a very good match... HHH vs Orton has already run its course, pretty boring. HHH wins it cleanly, deciding at the least minute not to use the sledge hammer for victory. Orton has a concussion during the match.

Winner: HHH

Score: 6/10

Royal Rumble Match

This was a great Royal Rumble Match, much better than last years. Man, Benoit has bad luck drawing numbers, this time getting #2 while Eddie got #1. The final four are Rey, Edge, Batista and Cena. Edge eliminates Rey after a spring board drop kick and then Edge gets eliminated. Batista had Cena up for the powerbomb to the outside, but Batista fell out with him. It appears as though we have a tie! But, no, noy on Vinny Mac's show. Vince runs to the ring (and hurts himself while jumping in), and demands that Batista and Cena start where they left off. Batista gets the victory after about one minute. Cena comes in and congratulates him on victory.

Winner: Batista

Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Edge Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels-This was a fairly long opening match and it was the wisest choice and the most obvious to start as it was the only match without a title on the line or a gimmick match. The match itself was very good and it won't have  finished this great feud as there was not a clean ending. Hopefully these two continue there great work from this great 18 minute or so match in the Royal Rumble Match. My rating 8.51/10.

Match Two-Casket Match-Undertaker Vs Heidenreich-This surprised me a lot and it had a good couple of surprises as well. One of which was Gene Snitsky interfering and then Kane fighting with him through the crowd. What a great sight it was seeing the Brothers Of Destruction reuniting. Heidenreich is improvely a little bit but not much and he botched a chokeslam really bad. There was lots of brutal action with the casket being used on numerous occasions. There was no blood but it was still a great match none the less. My rating 8.34/10.

Match Three-Triple Threat-WWE Title-JBL(C)Vs Big Show Vs Kurt Angle-Big Show dominated the early going until he got low blowed and sconned in the head with a TV monitor before falling through an announcer table. Kurt and Bradshaw fought in the ring with both men nailing each other with good moves. Big Show regain momentum before getting nailed with a very nicely done double team move. Quite a few finishers done but with kick outs not the other man breaking them up. Brutal moves to JBL knocking him through the barrier into the crowd causing JBL to get strecthered out. Luther Reigns,Mark Jindrak,DouG Basham,Danny Basham and Orlando Jordan all interfered in this match. The length was good except the ending wasn't the greatest but it was very sufficient. My rating 8.81/10.

Match Four-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Randy Orton-This had no Evolution as they were banned from ringside and this was won cleanly. Orton suffered a concussion in this match but still fought bravely. Both men hit lots of excellent manuevers and even some old school ones. The ending was a little strange but it made sense in a way. Hopefully this feud goes away as it is starting to bore me. Face Randy Orton is very bland and needs to be a heel again. My rating 8.89/10.

Match Five-Main Event-Royal Rumble Match-This match had lots of interest and many options and picks for who could win. The match was all in all good setting up quite a few feuds. I didn't like the ending that much as it was obviously a bit of a rip off and it just didn't give that feeling again. My rating 8.62/10.

Overall this show had five great matches so lets see how it scores. The score was 43.17/50. That score is equal to 86.34% which is an A-. I beieve this DVD is a must have as it has a great show along with some great extras.",1121212800,,4193,4.489389920424403
2194343,5,B0006SSNX2,"This is one of the 4 grand PPV of the WWE/F. The match everybody is wanting to see the most is none other than the 30 man over-the-top battle royal which is called Royal Rumble.

If you see the past Royal Rumbles(2001 - 2004), you will oviously see that its getting bad as years passes.(2004 was kinda good..)

2001 Royal Rumble = Stone Cold wins. Awesome PPV. 90%.

2002 Royal Rumble = Triple H wins. Great PPV. 88%.

2003 Royal Rumble = Brock Lesner wins. Rumble was boring. 71%

2004 Royal Rumble = Chris Benoit wins. Great commentary by JR. Rumble was a lot better than the year before. 83%.

I rated all those past Royal Rumbles by only Royal Rumbe match. I forgot the other matches, and I don't feel like lying.

This year's Royal Rumble, I bought the dvd. So now lets see if I was satisfied with the PPV. Ill put some of my personal feelings that wanted to happen. =)

100% - 90 = A historical PPV.

89 - 81 = One of the best Royal Rumble matches.

80 - 77 = Very successful PPV.

76 - 65 = Not bad, but not good either.

64 - 50 = Highly recommended NOT to watch, but if you're either Royal Rumble fan or a collector of every wwe dvds, than you can see it.

49 and under = This means its worth than the movie ""Robots"". What more can I say?

1st Match

Shawn Michaels vs Edge

-A great opening, with some great moves. Shawn Michaels makes matches so good. Edge wins by using the ropes. I didn't thought the spear would connect after he mimicked Shawn Michaels' intro of sweet chin music.

*Personal Feelings* I really wanted Michaels to win... dam edge when he used to ropes. 8.5/10

Eddie and Flair gets their number for the Rumble. Very funny comedy here and later on.

Also, Snitsky comes to Heidenreich's room and talk about something.

2nd Match

Undertaker vs Heidenreich in a Casket Match

-It was better than I expected. Gene Snitsky interferes the match but Kane was hiding in the casket! And also a great leg drop by the undertaker to heidenreich who was in between the casket. Undertaker gives heidenreich a tombstone and rolls him into the casket to capture the victory.

*Personal Feelings* Some people might say that the interference by Gene Snitsky made the match bad, but I kinda liked it because it made the cool part where Kane comes out of the casket. 8/10

Theodore Long comes to Eddies locker room and does the right thing. Very funny comedy, and how can you not like Eddie Guerrerro?

Christian and Cena does rap contest. I liked Cena at this time(January 2005), but when he started the whole chain gang thing, he became one of the guys I really dislike. Now(July 2005), I really like Christian and I wanted him to win the WWE champion at Vengeance.

3rd Match

JBL vs Kurt Angle vs Big Show in a Triple Threat for the WWE championship

-I kinda liked the match until the stupid cabinet of JBL showed up. That interference made the whole match bad. There was some awesome announce table broke, and a security wall breaking(which was cool). Stupid interference... JBL does a clothline from hell to Kurt Angle and gets the pin.

*Personal Feelings* Kurt Angle was my hope... Just one more time... I want to see Kurt being a champ for just one more time. 7.5/10 (wouldve been 8.5 if there wasn't any interference lol)

(Man I'm writing a lot)

Batista meets Carlito(He's cool) in the hallway. Nice talk by Batista.

4th Match

HHH vs Randy Orton

-This match was intersting and boring at the same time. Orton gets a concussion when he missed the DDT. At the last moment, he tries to RKO but gets countered. And then voila, pedigree from the game and HHH retains the title. The good thing was that there were no interference.

*Personal Feelings* Triple H is a good wrestler and I want to see him as a babyface(the good guy) once again. 8/10

Kurt Angle steals the rumble entry number from Nunzio. One fan from the crowd yelled ""Yeah!"" and I was saying the same thing at home.

JBL comes to where Theodore Long and Eric Bechoeff(however you spell) is. They celebrate and pours beer on each other. However the smile faded when Theodore Long told JBL about the next PPV's main event. BarbWire Steel Cage Match with the Big Show.

5th Match

Royal Rumble

***Spoiler on this Royal Rumble Match Review, so if you're willing to buy or rent the dvd I suggest you not to read this***

-Started off great, as entry #1 was Eddie, and #2 was Benoit. Daniel Puder comes right after that, and does some mike performance. Than he gets his butt kicked by Eddie, Benoit, and the 4th entry Hardcore. At entry #18, Simon Dean comes. Does some excersize at the ringside which is very laughable. I really like Simon Dean, and I want him to get at least one championship. He gets in the ring and does squats, when HBK comes as 19th entry. And talk about the expression when HBK saw Simon Dean! He clothlined Simon and mimicked him by squating. This probably was my one of my fave moment in this years Royal Rumble. Kurt Angle comes as the 20th entry, and dominates the ring, until HBK reversed the anckle rock and did Sweet Chin Music to Angle and eliminated him. I personally thought Angle got eliminated too fast, but oh well. I knew he wasn't going to win anyways. Later on, he comes to the ring and eliminates HBK. Does some stuff to get revenge. At 28th entry Batista comes. When nature boy Rick Flair(30th entry) comes, they beat up Coach and Christian. And like 10 minutes after that, it was up to Cena or Batista. Batista tried to the Batista Bomb but goes to the rope, and Batista and Cena touches the ground at the exact same time. I was very impressed. Vince comes and makes the match restart (Only by Batista and Cena). Batista eliminates Cena and wins the Royal Rumble. By the way, I was predicting that Batista would win.

Anyways, this years Royal Rumble Match was 10/10, with some comedy in it.

That makes this years Royal Rumble 42/50, which is 84%. But I'll add 2% more for the good comedy by Eddie. So that makes it 86%, which is one of the best royal rumble matches. =)

In the Extra, there is a great feature called ""Royal Rumble History"" and ""More Royal Rumble History"". I highly recommed to buy this dvd. =)",1120003200,,6136,4.43048128342246
2194344,5,B0006SSNX2,"1. HBK vs. Edge: A very good match the pace was kind of slow for me but still one of the better PPV openers you will see with Edge prevailing over HBK by getting support on the ropes. He does have an impressive performance in the rumble as well. 7/10

2. Undertaker vs. Heidenreich, casket match: An interesting matchup although Heidenreich is not a great performer. Entertaining anyway with run-ins from Snitsky and Kane. Taker wins. 7/10

3. JBl9(c) vs. Angle vs. Big Show, Triple threat match for wwe title: I was very entertained by this match even despite the run-ins. Jbl wins continuing his very respectable title reign that eventually ended at Wrestlemania. 8/10

4. HHH(c) vs. Randy Orton for World Heavyweight title: Really good match with HHH getting a clean pin over Orton with no interference as Evolution was banned from ringside. This was icing on the cake for Orton's failed push for main event status. Hopefully he will find new light as he has recently been drafted to smackdown via the very groundbreaking draft lottery. 8/10

5. Royal Rumble match: All Royal Rumble matches are pretty much great and this one was no different. A very exciting match with a highly dramatic ending with Batista and Cena being simultaneously eliminated and then Vinnie Mac coming out and restarting the match while blowing out his quadriceps entering the ring. Batista wins and caps it off by defeating HHH at Wrestlemania to become World Champ. I question both him and Cena as the future of the wwe. I think Shelton Benjamin and Randy Orton are the future of the wwe because they are better in ring perfomers. As of now, June, 25, 05, I predict that either Orton or Benjamin will win the '06 rumble. 10/10

Overall I would grade this PPV as an A with no real momentum killers and a spectacular Rumble match. The dvd extras also include a great look at some classic rumble matches.",1119484800,,1881,4.7051671732522795

As has already been said, the actual rumble was the highlight of the show, and to me it went so fast, it seemed like a normal length match!

Casket Match

Heidenreich vs Undertaker 8/10- a good match that starts out rather slow & boring. Gene Snitsky & Kane interfere, then the action picks up as well as the crowd. a hard fought match with many good moments. WWE ought to let Heidenreich add some of his karate expertise to his arsenal.

another Raw meets Smackdown moment: Batista & Carlito Carribean Cool. Evolution confront Eddie Guerrero & Theodore Long. another great moment between Christian, Tyson Tomko & John Cena as they draw numbers. Cena meets Hemme.

Match #1 Edge vs. Shawn Michaels: Great opener! Almost 20 minutes of pure wrestling! I loved this match and it ended the way it should have...Edge hanging onto the ropes for leverege! 9.5/10

Lots of funny backstage segments happened throughout the show involving the superstars picking their numbers and interacting with one another. Watch for Eddie Guererro w/ Ric Flair and John Cena w/ Christian! Great stuff!

Match #2 Taker vs. Heidenreich in a Casket Match: Was much better then expected. Snitsky showed up to help Hedenreich beat up Taker...then Kane popped out of the casket and took care of Snitsky! Undertaker wins, plain and simple! Very entertaining! 7/10

Match #3 Big Show vs. JBL (c) vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship: This was AWESOME, but way too short! Great spot where Big Show plows JBL through the guard wall on the outside. Kurt's goons and the Cabinet all interfere to screw Big Show allowing JBL to land the clothesline from hell of Kurt! JBL retains!!! 8.5/10

Match #4 HHH (c) vs. Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship: After Bischoff saw how much outside interference was in the WWE Title match, he tried to up one on Teddy Long by making Evolution banned from ringside. And it HELPED!!! This was actually a very good match! Orton ends up getting a ""concussion"" and HHH kicks his ass! HHH retains!!! 9/10

Match #5 The Royal Rumble: What an awesome Rumble match! Not as good as last years, but great nonetheless! Having Kurt take Nunzio's number was an awesome wya to get him into the match to trigger his feud with HBK!!! We also saw both rosters team up to eliminate Hassan! Benoit showed he was the man by lasting almost 50 minutes from the #2 spot! Funny stuff when Ric Flair tried to pull a fast one on Batista and elminate him...which was unsuccessful! Batista and Cena were the final two and they almost went the route they went in '94 where Bret Hart and Lex Luger went out at the same time. This could have worked but they opted against it.

Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. JBL - I cant stand triple threat matches. They all have the same set-up. One guy gets knocked out and the other two guys fight, and it alternates who knocked out.

EDGE defeated SHAWN MICHAELS: Up & down opener which ultimately won me over. With such an excellent feud, the opening of this bout lacked a little intensity & imagination. However, it was fairly well built up with Edge constantly just trying to keep on top of his opponent. Because of that logical psychology, the overuse of restholds probably didn't bother me as much as it should have. Just short of the 10 minute mark, the pace, entertainment & ingenuity of the match all picked up. That thankfully continued all the way through to the pinfall at the 19 minute mark. The many near falls & reversals were more than sufficiently performed, and while the 2 did have a few too many awkward moments, the effectiveness of the feud won through. They can undoubtedly do better & I hope the WWE allow them to prove it. But this was still very good. Match Rating...8

THE UNDERTAKER defeated HEIDENREICH in a Casket Match: The first 5 minutes of this match was an awkward mish-mash of everything that 'Taker has attempted to incorporate into his matches over the past 2 years. While I can see why it was attempted, it didn't really work as a whole. At that stage, I was actually glad to see Snitsky run out to interfere. Ditto for the Kane casket appearance. From that point onwards, any seriousness was pretty much thrown out the window. It initially worked in the entertainment stakes, but quickly winded back down into the usual big man casket match we have seen too many times before. Except this one may actually have been sloppier. Especially the ending which included a botched DDT & a botched chokeslam. Luckily, the whole match only lasted 13 minutes & was broken nicely in half by the interference, setting up the rumored WM21 tag match. I'm tempted to fail this, but I suppose it wasn't all that bad. Match Rating...5

JOHN BRADSHAW LAYFIELD defeated KURT ANGLE & THE BIG SHOW in a Triple Threat Match to Retain the WWE Championship: Last week I stated that this match would be the barometer for the ppv. And I think that turned out to be true. For the most part, this was a wonderfully booked & well-performed match, which actually took advantage of the tricky triple threat stipulation. All 3 men played their part almost perfectly, and there was a good mixture of as much as these guys could do, throughout the first 10 minutes. Furthermore, there was an intensity & pace about the bout which to me, put over the title very well. Unfortunately, the finish was overbooked with Jindrak, Reigns & the Cabinet all getting involved, leading to the way too abrupt pinfall at the 12 minute mark. Apart from the finish, this was excellent stuff. And it's further proof of how much a good build-up in a feud, coupled with in-ring performances, can accomplish. Match Rating...8

TRIPLE H defeated RANDY ORTON to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: Sidenote: I could almost write a whole column on this match alone. Also, forgive me if I go over the top & include too much opinion. I just cannot believe that anyone thought that this was a terrible bout & believe that in most cases, it's purely because of personal dislike for Randy Orton and/or Triple H. This was basically a match of 4 five minute quarters. The first 5 minutes was absolutely sensational. It flowed at a great pace & had an effective blend of everything. The intensity & booking of that time was superb & really took the feud to new heights. At that stage, it was almost a 10 out of 10 match! The following 5 minutes predictably saw Triple H attack Orton's injured knee, and it was sufficiently effective. The 3rd quarter also went to plan as Orton made the comeback, while the champ used a good variety of moves & tactics to try & finish the job. At this stage, this match had far exceeded my expectations. Then, in the final 7 minutes of the bout, we saw some sort of concussion angle played out, as Orton looked dazed & was battling to survive.

While Orton pulled the concussion angle off really well (many people thought he was genuinely ill), I didn't think it was effectively set up. A huge spot was needed to emphasize the concussion (but that's not Orton's fault). It all went on way too long with the inevitable pinfall occurring at the 22 minute mark. In my opinion, the concussion angle should have set in around the 12 minute mark & the match should have concluded at approximately the 18 minute mark. So, this was strangely booked, but considering that, it was still a success with 2 top notch performances. Orton stepped up here, and from memory, didn't even use 1 resthold! Match Rating...8

ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH Won By BATISTA: I always find this battle royal hard to rate, as it's almost impossible for the WWE to stuff it up so much, that it rates under an 7. As per usual, this was very fun to watch, from beginning to end. Starting off with Eddie & Benoit, and having them last so long, was an excellent idea. So too was the rather risky move of having 7 quality performers (Eddie, Benoit, Edge, Rey, Shelton, Booker & Jericho) all come out in the first 11 participants (even though it didn't stop some slowish moments around the 30 minute mark). Continuing on with the positives, the little scene-stealing angles involving Puder, Hassan, Eddie/Rey/Booker, Haas/Benjamin, Snitsky/London & Angle/HBK were all very cleverly booked & worked to maximum effect. The nice touch of having Bischoff & Long out there supporting their superstars also worked a treat.

After Edge & Rey were eliminated (by the way, they were great choices to get to the final 4), the finish predictably came down to Batista & Cena, who were both extremely over with the fans. They also had both been put over well by Kane, who took a Batista Bomb & FU to the floor. Oh, and I won my odds-on bet that Batista would be entrant number 26-30, if anyone is interested! It may be a tad too picky, but I must admit that I didn't like the finish. Not only the recycling of the dual winner idea. Not only that it was a little botched, with Batista fairly clearly touching the ground first. But predominantly because I don't think it lasted a sufficient enough time to (a) put them both over & (b) entertain us to the maximum effect. And I'm referring to both before & after the restart. Note that I am ignoring the rumored time problems the WWE had on the night. I'd almost go as far as saying that this was the cheapest win in Rumble history, but that would be a little harsh. Still a very entertaining watch as per usual. Match Rating...8

PPV RATING (37/50) = 74

Looking at the key, I have basically given the 2005 Royal Rumble a 'B+' grade & said that it was 'Very good'. Believe it or not, that is the equal 2nd highest rating that I have ever given a WWE pay-per-view (equal with WrestleMania 17 & behind SummerSlam '02). Absolutely sensational stuff from the WWE here. Importantly, the matches were all well built up, and the performers finished the job off in the ring. Obviously, it's easier to build up feuds when there are only 5 matches spanning the 2 brands, but I still believe this is an area that the WWE needs to improve on, and well & truly did here. If anything, it was only the finishes (to pretty much every match) that let the card down a little. They weren't too terrible, but they were noticeable. And it would be remiss of me to ignore the tremendous backstage segments throughout the night. They were all top notch, as was the Raw vs SmackDown niggling. An excellent way to begin the 'Road To WrestleMania'. Huge props to all concerned. I might end this review with a freestyle rap, so.....

Then the Animal came in eliminating everything in sight. It was down to John Cena and Batista at the end and they both went out of the ring at the same time.

The main events were great too, and the RR match is a must see for any wrestling fan of Royal Rumble matches.

A nice way to start the night with long submissions and fast paced wrestling. Edge dominated for most of the match. I give it an 7.5/10- winner Edge

M2-Undertaker V.S Heidenriech (or whatever his name is)In a CASKETMATCH

Not what I expected,the match was,nt so good. I thought it would be more of an brawl though. Well,there are some good points in the match when Snitskey and Kane interrupt the match and when Heiden drives the casket over The Undertaker and when when Taker leg drops on the casket when Heiden,s neck is inside and ofcourse Taker wins by giving Heiden a tombstone piledriver and then locks Heiden inside the casket. I give it 7/10

M3-JBL(c)V.S Bigshow V.S Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship

An excellent match!!!A table and the barricade wall were broken. Bigshow dominated for most of the match. It was a nice clean match, only in someplaces a bit of hardcore. But that cheater JBL won,by cheating ofcourse. I give this match a 8.5/10 cause it was quite short for a WWE Championship match.

M4-HHH V.S Randy 0rton for the WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

A very good match. Good effort from both the superstars. WOW!!!!!HHH won it without the help of Evolution. This clearly shows that HHH is better(infact much better)than Randy 0rton. I give this match a 8.5/10

An impresive Royal R.It has a boring starting with only chops and stupid superstars(except eddie and benoit).After Rey enters then the real match started. It was very nice to see Charlie Haas and Benjamin to team up with their old tagteam signature move. I was very upset to see Angle go so soon ,even Kane(some other guys also went early but these guys were the impt ones).And Edge getting to eleminate two SMACKDOWN,s top superstars,Eddie and Rey. I wanted John Cena to win but even Batista is one heck of a guy.  Winner-Batista. I give this Royal Rumble a 8.75/10.

I recommend that you buy this DVD,you won,t be dissapointed.

Next it's HBK shawn michaels vs marty jannety right before they team again on raw just a week or two latter. pretty nice match but man did hbk's head get busted bad by a ring step man that must hurt 8/10 good efort by both guys!

Next it's triple h vs randy orton vs john cena for the wwe hevyweight title great match if you liuke cena and orton but i don't and i still like this one cause triple h is and will always be the man and he won with a top rope pedigree on to a ladder on orton nice move a must see spot on the show 10/10 great pedigree at the end. must buy for that and the extras!

2194365,4,B0006SSNX2,"The Royal Rumble My Card:

Edge vs. Matt Hardy in a rematch from New Year's Revolution:

 This match was made because of the questionable ending at New Year's Revolution.  Matt pulls out a chain hits Edge with it, but then Edge gets up goes for the Spear and misses.  Matt has the small package but Edge turns and gets the tights and the ropes for 3.

Winner: Edge 6 out of 10

Orlando Jordan vs. Hardcore Holly for the U.S. Title:

 Pretty decent match for 2 guys who barely wrestle on Smackdown!  Cena comes down and beats up Orlando.  The Cabinet and JBL beat up Cena and Holly.  Orlando crawls over to cover Holly but Rey Mysterio Hits the Drop on the Dime followed by an Eddie frog Splash.  Chavo then comes out and tells Rey to watch out.  Holly gets distracted and Orlando hits him with the belt for the win.

Winner: Orlando Jordan 5 out of 10

Triple H & Ric Flair vs. Batista & Randy Orton:

 One of the better tag matches in a while.  Not a minute did it get boring.  Near the end HHH hits Batista with a Sledgehammer but Orton takes the Sledge and hits HHH then he hits the RKO on Flair for the win.

Winners: Batista & Randy Orton 9 out of 10

JBL vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship:

 Pretty good match.  Cena really can't stick with JBL though.  JBL outwrestled Cena the whole way through.  Guess who comes out....The Cabinet.  Wait, then comes down Hardcore Holly with a trash can it hand.  He takes out the Cabinet and Cena walks into a Clothesline From Hell.

Winner: JBL 7 out of 10

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle in a 3 stages of Hell Match:

 1st fall Street Fight:  Amazing spot when Michaels hits a Moonsault off the ladder onto Angle.  Michaels tunes up the band but Angle reverses into an Angle Slam then angle gets a chair and it breaks over HBK's head.  At this point Shawn is bleeding like crazy.  Angle walks into the ring with a Ladder but HBK kicks it back into his face and wins the 1st fall.  2nd Fall Hell In A Cell:  Angle breaks open the door and brings Shawn on top.  Angle puts the Ankle Lock on, on the part then keeps the Cell closed.  Michaels then pushes him back and flips angle over and Angle falls through.  Michaels then hits the Elbow Drop but Angle kicks out!  Shawn was talking to the ref then Angle hit the Angle Slam to when the 2nd Fall.  3rd fall Last Man Standing:  In this match they each others finishers.  Michaels hit the Angle Slam and the Ankle Lock.  Angle hit Shawn with Sweet Chin Music.  Angle kept getting up and so did Shawn.  HBK wins after he hits Sweet Chin Music again.

Winner: Shawn Michaels 10 out of 10

5. Royal Rumble Match!

15 Raw and 15 Smackdown Supersarts Compete For One Prize!

All I can say about this rumble is that its one of the best ones I ever saw. Batista won it! The end probably was the most funnies I saw! Vince McMahon at the end went to the ring , and his legs hit the apron. So when he got in the ring he fell down and just sat down near the bottom rope! Looking at Batista and Cena. Then they invisibly pulled him out of the ring, and Tazz and J.R. never mentioned McMahon because he would of fired them for embarrasing him :P. (Vince broke his 2 legs that night).

Score: 10/10

I add some more points for segments during the rumble and the bonuses on DVD.

Shawn Michaels vs. Edge

Thought they was going to save this match for Mania, guess I was wrong. Edge and Michaels have a nice match to start off the show. Edge wins this one. I have to say best pay per view opener so far this year. Rating: ***

Casket Match

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich

Okay match, gets boring in the middle sometimes. This is Taker and Heidenreigh's best match in their feud. Luckily, this is a gimmick match. The apperences made this match though, Snitsky comming out to help Heidenreigh and Kane poping out the casket to help/save Taker. Taker tombstones Heidenreigh and puts him in the casket for the win. Rating: **

WWE Championship

Triple-Threat Match

JBL vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show

Nice match, everytime Kurt and Big Show are in triple threat matches together, they give good performances. I was into this match the whole time. Love the spot where Kurt hits the tv on Big Show's head to make him fall threw the annoucers table. Ending has JBL get back in the ring to give Kurt the clothesline from hell to win this one. Rating: ***

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs. Randy Orton

Not a great match, but not a bad one either. I have to say at least it was better than their Unforgiven match last year. Near the end of this match it actually looked like Orton had a concussion. Triple H gets the win and this time by himself without any help from Flair or Batista, which is good. Rating: ** 1/2

Royal Rumble Match (15 Raw superstars, 15 Smackdown superstars and 30 total).

You should all know that every year the Royal Rumble is entertaining to me. There were a LOT of moments (comedy moments are included also). Daniel Puder just got OWNED by Holly, Eddie and Benoit at the start of the Rumble. In the middle of the match Raw guys team up (same goes with Smackdown guys) to fight each other. Funniest moment in the Rumble HAS to be when EVERYONE in the Rumble jumped Muhammad Hassan. I loved it also when Kurt Angle came in and just clean house on everyone. Shame he went over the ropes after a couple of minutes he been in it. I'm glad WWE started to build the Kurt vs Shawn Michaels match that's going to happen at Mania 21 from here with Angle beating the mess out of HBK after throwing him out. The ending of this match had Batista and Cena (the last two left in the match go at it )with both men going over the rope (they could of left that part out) but they restarted the match and Batista won it. Good Rumble, lame/okay ending. Rating: ****

The extras have a little more this time with a couple of Royal Rumble promos for matches (commericals). The build-up vids for the Rumble match and the Triple-Threat match, they also show what happens after the Rumble, Teddy Long giving Batista a contract and the JBL interview that was shown on Raw the next day.

Casket Match

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich

Disappointing.  Not much happened by way of wrestling or brawling for that matter.  It gets a mild boost from appearances by Snitsky and Kane but that happens within the first 10 minutes.  Their SS match was much better.

Shawn Micheals vs Edge

Great opener, a little un-even due to the different styles, Micheals is breaking down, the match saw some great counters and near falls, leading to a predictable ""use your feet on the ropes"" tactic to give Edge the victory. ***

Casket Match

Undertaker vs Heidenreich:

First of all, this match was nowhere near ""10 starz, LOL, ROFTL"", such a rating can only come from deluded Undertaker marks who think he can still wrestle. He can't. Deal with it. Heindreich blew every move he made here and it was clear' Taker was annoyed by this. **

2194379,5,B0006SSNX2,"Notice I said OVERALL.  It was the best overall Royal Rumble PPV ever.  Some really good matches and some funny promos in the middle of them. Here's My Take on the Rumble:

1) HBK vs. Edge-10 out of 10.  Excellent opener. I was on the edge of my couch the last 5 minutes. I'd like to see a sequel, but it'll have to wait til after WrestleMania apparently.

2) The Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Heidenreich- 10 out of 10.  This was a really good casket match, though not the best I've seen. Good interference from the Raw guys.

3)JBL vs. Angle vs. Big Show- 10 out of 10.  Shockingly good match. I'm not a big Smackdown fan but I was pretty impressed with the triple threat match.  It wasn't WM 20 or anything like that. But it served its purpose, entertained me, and set up a future title offense.  Got to give it 10.

4) HHH vs. Orton- 7 out of 10- This match was lacking to say the least. Horrible booking.  It's pretty bad when a profound HHH hater actually roots for him to beat the ""good"" guy. I think Orton was pushed too early and has really sucked as a wrestler and as a character after it.

*Spoiler* Orton is knocked out into mid card level where his career can hopefully be salvaged. *Spoiler*

5) The Royal Rumble- 10 out of 10- My favorite type of match.  It was a good Rumble, told a lot of stories, and ended the way it should have ended with the two biggest rising stars in each brand.

Get this DVD. It is stacked with good matches, although one could be debatable. Good sign for future WWE PPV's to come.",1107907200,,1522,4.232638888888889
2194380,4,B0006SSNX2,"This is a review of the PPV itself and not the forthcoming DVD.

The Sunday Night Heat Match saw Maven pin Rhyno utilizing the ropes for ""leverage"".

A ** performance.

The Opening Match was the Grudge Match pitting HBK against Edge, I can not remember the last time I saw HBK, The Show Stoppa, The Headlinna, The Main Event, open a PPV, thus showing he is an athlete for the fans to love, HHH is far to arrogant to ever open and would most likely storm off. Anyway Edge paid attention to Maven's match cause he beat HBK the same way, grabbing the ropes.

A *** match.

Next was the Casket Match Undertaker vs. Hienenrick. Snitsky interfered John and Gene were dragging Taker to the casket, the casket opened, and Kane popped out beat down John and Gene. Taker Chokeslammed and Tombstoned Hienenrick and put him in the casket and won the match.

A ***** match.

The Triple Threat Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship saw JBL successfully defend his Title against Angle and the Big Show by pinning none other than your Olympic Hero and not mine Kurt Angle. Proving for the last time that JBL is the best-damned WWE Champ since The Only Big Thing Brock Lesnar and seeing, as Lesnar was the best champion since the title's mold was broken makes JBL pretty good.

A solid ***** showing.

The World Title had Trips defending his title in a hard fought match with Orton. Randy and HHH botched a move causing Orton to knock himself silly and one could see that there was a problem with Orton; it was more than just selling a move. Orton's pupils were visibly dilated, his movement was slow, his reactionary time was off, but what really shows Orton's injury was real was when Trips went for the Pedigree, he was careful with the execution and after the pin Trips looked at Orton with Concern.

A *** match.

The Kane vs. Snitsky match did not happened and it was not announced why it was not going to happen, my only guess was that time would not permit.

The Royal Rumble match itself was great, the first number is the number the wrestler entered the Rumble and the second number is the number he was tossed, Nuzio had his number taken from him by Angle and was not in the Rumble, in his place Angle was in.

Cena and Batista went out at the same time (Royal Rumble 94 Lex and Bret) however instead of Cena facing JBL at WM21 and Batista facing Trips at WM 21, Vince came ""power walking"" to the ring but he planted his foot wrong stepping in to the ring and it looked like he blew his wheel out, so instead of making the call the ring announcer said ""By order of the Chairman of the Board of the WWE, Vince McMahon this rumble will continue"" and Batista tossed Cena.

Edge def. Shawn Michaels

Good opening match. A bit shocked that Edge won but he did cheat to win.  7/10

Casket Match

Undertaker def. Heidenreich

WOW !!! Great Match a lot of big bumps in this match. Gene Snitsky and Kane get involved in this match my favorite part is when Kane came out of the casket.

10/10

Triple-Threat Match for the WWE Championship

John""Bradshaw""Layfield(c) def. Kurt Angle & Big Show

MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!! Could have been longer but you can't argue The Cabient & Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak get involved in a huge brawl with the Big Show the best part is when Big Show throws JBL into the ring barrier great stuff.  10/10

World Heavyweight Championship Match

Triple H def. Randy Orton

Not a good match Randy didn't even get the RKO in this match and it also looked like that Orton may got a head injury after he miss the DDT on Triple H.

Probably the worst perforemce from Randy Orton to date.  5/10

Royal Rumble Match

Great Rumble. Great Spots but Cena got screw. This royal rumble was about to be 1994 all over again when Bret Hart & Lex Luger were both named co-winners of the Royal Rumble but BATISTA IS GOING TO WRESTLEMANIA 21!!! Rey Mysterio lasted up to the end and Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle looks like they are going to meet at WrestleMania 21.

2194383,5,B0006SSNX2,"Victor Slain, the future WWE champion, is back to write up a preview of the upcoming WWE PPV, the 2005 ROYAL RUMBLE

Triple H v.s Randy Orton (world heavyweight title)

I am shocked that this match is on the PPV. I mean, with Orton not in the rumble, who in the blue hell (thankyou Rocky) is gonna win this years rumble? I personally think that it could be Batista, but i just don't think he is quite ready yet. Im not 100% sure who will win this match but you would think HHH would as usual.

JBL v.s The Big Show v.s Kurt Angle (WWE championship)

This match has one of the most entertaining build ups for a championship in a long time. I have really enjoyed the Joy/Aimee interaction, and how Kurt Angle has been involved in things with both these girls. I cant see JBL losing just here however.

The Undertaker v.s Heidenreich (casket match)

I can see The Undertaker winning clean and ending the fued altogether. But, If the fued is to continue, then i see Heidenreich winning with help from Gene Snitsky. After their interaction at Survivor Series, i could see something similar to Vince/Taker in the buried alive match a few years ago. Undertaker being defeated due to unlikely interference.

30 man ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH

Superstars such as Kane, Shawn Michaels, Edge, Christian, Shelton Benjamin, Booker T, Mark Jindrack and Charlie Haas have all been enterered at this moment.

funaki vs. billy kidman this match should be a good opener if it happens.

r.v.d and rey mysterio vs. the bashem brothers for the titles this should be a high flying match in which rey and r.v.d will retain.

shelton benjaimen vs.maven this would be awsome but i dought it will happen here it will happen at n.y.r.

wwe title jbl vs.the big show sqash match untill jbl's cabnit interfears but big show will take them on but turn around into a title shot followed by the clothsline from hell for the pin. jbl's gonna keep the title untill no way out where he will lose it toeddie gurrero.

8042883,4,B0006SSNX2,"1.) Edge vs Shawn Michaels

This was a feud that had been brewing since Taboo Tuesday when Edge bitterly turned heel, costing Shawn Michaels his World Title match. It all came to a point here with this highly personal grudge match. This was such an underrated feud and one of my favorites back in 2004/2005. Michaels starts with the offense, working Edge over in the corner and against the ropes with knife edge chops. Edge counters an irish whip backdrop into a swinging neckbreaker. Michaels tries to regain control with chops and an attempted dropkick but Edge counters it with a sitdown powerbomb. Every time Michaels tries to get in a defense, Edge cleverly finds a way to keep the momentum on his side. Edge gets some good heel heat at one point, mocking Michaels with his signature trademark taunt. What follows is a tremendous back and forth bout between Edge and Michaels---just too many chops for my liking at points during the match. In the end, Edge counters a roll up into his and uses the ropes for leverage to get the win. Solid opening bout that was a sign that things were looking up for Edge during his heel run.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hilarious backstage segment with Smackdown's Eddie Guerrero and Raw's Ric Flair entering the Raw and Smackdown office to draw their Royal Rumble numbers. Flair apparently has drawn a great number is happy go lucky, while Eddie seems none too pleased about his drawing. Eddie gives Flair a congratulatory hug and is on his way. Ric shows everyone his number but they don't look all that thrilled and Flair comes to find out that Eddie stole his number. Flair goes on a hunt to get it back

Snitsky and Heidenreich have an extremely uncomfortable encounter in the locker room with Snitsky apparently offering Heidenreich some help in his match

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Casket Match: Heidenreich vs The Undertaker

The overall premises of this feud felt very 90s cliche. Undertaker looks too unstoppable, so a big guy gets brought in to try and take him out. It happened so many times with Undertaker in the 90s and it felt that way with this feud. This was Undertaker's 3rd Casket Match to take place at the Royal Rumble and he'd won none of them at this event. His first was in 1994 against Yokozuna which he lost thanks to the interference of several wrestlers. The second time was in 1998 to Shawn Michaels thanks to Kane. Would Undertaker suffer a 3rd Casket Match loss at the Rumble? Heidenreich controls Undertaker for a few minutes of the match, but Taker manages to wear Heidenreich down with a Triangle Choke in what would years later be know as Hell's Gates. Suddenly, Snitsky interferes to a chorus of boos from the crowd and takes out Undertaker. The crowd begins chanting for Kane as they drop the Deadman with a double team suplex. Just as the 2 prepare to stuff Undertaker in the casket, Kane emerges from it and attacks Heidenreich and Snitsky. Kane fights Snitsky through the crowd, leaving it just back to Undertaker and Sycho Sid 2.0. The fight continues on. Noteworthy spot in the match where Taker leg drops the casket lid on the back of the head of Heidenreich. A Chokeslam and Tombstone Piledriver to Sycho Sid 2.0 spells the end as Taker rolls his body into the casket and closes the lid for the win. Meh match. It was okay. Nothing spectacular for sure

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The hijinks with Eddie Guerrero continue as Flair sends Triple H and Batista after Eddie while Teddy Long tries to get Flair's Rumble number from Eddie. Eddie reluctantly gives Flair his number back but Teddy Long still holds out his hand to Eddie. Turns out Guerrero had Flair's wallet as well! Flair is enraged! Good stuff! Dissension between Triple H and Batista is teased which just gave more foreshadowing for later in the night.

3.) WWE Championship Triple Threat Match: Kurt Angle vs Big Show vs JBL (c)

An extremely great match. Much better than I and many others I'm sure, expected it to be. We had some pretty good spots such as Kurt Angle knocking Big Show off the steel steps, through the announce table and Show spearing JBL through the barricade. It was excellently fast paced for a Triple Threat Match that didn't slow down for a second, Angle attempts a chair shot on Show, but Show reverses it with a flapjack, causing Angle to fall face first on the chair. JBL's Cabinet come down and assist JBL while Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak interfere on behalf of Angle. While Jindrak and Reigns deal with Show, Orlando Jordan sneaks JBL back in the ring who hits a Clothesline From Hell on a stunned Angle for the win. Excellent match!",1453593600,,5001,5.1833952912019825
