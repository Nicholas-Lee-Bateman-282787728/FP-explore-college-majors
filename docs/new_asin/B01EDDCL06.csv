8758365,2,B01EDDCL06,"These documentaries put some great information out there.  But I felt the narrator and commentary was so ignorant and made many logical fallacies when coming to conclusions.

Certainly some of these events are very fascinating.  But there are many assumptions being made on shaky ground.

Also when they had someone read Admiral Byrd's quote right after the narrator said the quote and they tried to imply the voice actor was Admiral Byrd.  That was tacky.

Most viewers probably will draw their own conclusions, but from a philosophical and ethical point of view.  The arguments put forth had good examples but were not logically sound.

Do I believe life exists outside of Earth?  Yes
Do I believe there are massive cover ups and alien species currently visiting and living on Earth?  I need more sound evidence.

Just my 2 cents.",1537315200,,832,4.913669064748201
8758366,5,B01EDDCL06,"Really the best series on ufos. It gives you the major themes in ufo history from sourced materials in their files. It would be great if there was another layer so that viewers could  look at the original materials, maybe someday. Most series show a lot of footage from debunked sightings, but MUFON is way beyond that. I would love to amass all the text from all the sightings in their files and look for changes in description of ufos over time and other things through text analysis. It would be great to do some big data analysis if this ever gets digitized. Volunteers?",1537142400,,574,4.519230769230769
8758367,5,B01EDDCL06,"This show deals with UFO stuff and the government's involvement. They bring up old cases, talk about released documents, things the government was involved in, etc. You want to hear about government coverups? Secret bases underground? Presidents who have had contact with UFOs? This is the show for you! Most of the focus tends to be in the 50s/60s I find, you know when the whole UFO thing took off. I think it's because it's the only time you actually have access to those documents. Surely things are happening today, but there's no way we'll ever get our hands on those docs... I think my favorite part is that the presenters are quick to tell you that ""His/her story doesn't check out"" or that ""IF their story is true..."" The people at MUFON want to make sure stories are as true as they can be before sharing it. It's unlike Ancient Aliens in that they believe in EVERYTHING.  Anyway, if you like Ancient Aliens, you should like this show.",1537142400,,945,4.591715976331361

No ""real"" or ""new"" actual footage, just old ufo stories montaged with stock video and same old speakers. Better programming has been done by amateurs on YouTube. But THANK GOD they mentioned and covered Roswell in one of the early episodes, because that's never been done 1,000,001 times before. For the love of...",1535760000,2,399,4.882352941176471
