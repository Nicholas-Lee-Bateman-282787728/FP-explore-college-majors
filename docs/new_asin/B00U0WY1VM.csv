7027168,5,B00U0WY1VM,"This has quickly become one of my favorite series of all time. For those who haven't seen it, I'd compare it to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, except the remnants of humanity are fighting tentacled aliens instead of killer robots. Just like BSG, this series has a little bit of everything: thrilling space battles, political intrigue, romance, comedy, philosophy, mystery, and some really well-written characters. There's also a great sense of complex world-building, and (like BSG) the writers pay attention to hard-science stuff like physics. I cannot recommend this series highly enough. So highly that, even though I can watch it on Netflix, I still want to own it for my library. Fantastic series, please give it a try!",1437004800,,738,5.2100840336134455
7027169,5,B00U0WY1VM,"This anime is one that has truly changed my point of view for animes. I usually watch them to see what sort of crazy f***** up stuff will this one have, but since I saw the first episode on Netflix I knew that this could have the chance to be something significant, although at some points I was a bit too weird, but I'm glad I kept watching. Knights of Sidonia, to me, has become my favorite anime of all time it's due to this aspects:
1) The Story- The story is well told, it sets up that humanity is on the verge of becoming extinct because of alien threat that has left us nearly destroyed and humanity must find a way to fight the threat and come out victorious.
2) The Characters- The characters are completely excellent, they are well developed and they're all significant and have an impact on our main character, Nagate Tanikaze, they all leave an impact that make Nagate evolve as character and as person, most of this characters can be seen as simply characters of some show, but these are the types of characters that can be seen as actual people.
3) The Setting- The setting of this show is one that any Sci-Fi fan will like and eventually will just love the design, the mixture between some old style Japan and the high tech future, and of course the space scenes make the universe come of alive with incredible styles and artworks.
4) The Animation- The animation is one of the most unique aspect about this show, because it's animated in sort of 3DCGI that works great for the designs of the show and makes the characters look better, but in some areas it can tear away from how the mouths of the characters tend to look odd from time to time, but that's not a big concern in animes (at least in my opinion).
5) The Soundtrack- The soundtrack, apart from the opening and ending songs, the actual pieces of music that are use, boost the atmosphere of the show with this sort of thriller/mysterious tone, and also when the action scenes start the music is also really well used. P.S: The opening and ending songs are great, I didn't mean that they are awful there far from it.
All of these aspects make this show come alive, and brings us something for some people might be just another show, but for a true fan of both anime and Sci-Fi this a show that deserves a spot in your collection and I highly recommend this show, but since this price is just way to big, do yourself a favor and look for it at cheaper price or watch it for free on Netflix(BTW Season 2 is now also available so there's a nice bonus). So that bring me to my final verdict for Knights of Sidonia to a:
10/10- Meaning that despite the faults that this show has, they don't take away from the experience and I guarantee that you'll become immerse in its world.",1436140800,,2746,4.354775828460039
7027170,5,B00U0WY1VM,"For an anime series it seems to have everything action, science fiction, mystery, comedy humor and romance all balanced into this series.  There are times you just are gripping your seat in hopes that the main character doesn't die.  I will admit for a series I was well pleased with the entertainment.  At times this series feels serious.  I will have to say I love this series.",1433980800,2,379,4.611940298507463
7027171,5,B00U0WY1VM,This series is great i didn't expect to like it but as i got through the first 20 seconds i was hooked,1433980800,,102,3.6818181818181817
7027172,1,B00U0WY1VM,"Let me be clear, this series is great.  I loved it when it came on Netflix last year, and I'm looking forward to the next season coming out next month.  The setting and premise are perfectly conceived, with just the right authentic-feeling sci-fi aesthetic that I love.  The characters are interesting and likable, the art and animation look great especially in combat, the musical score is hits just the right spot for sci-fi.  The dub is really well done, too, it's the version I watched.  It's fantastic, well on the way to being one of my favorite sci-fi series ever, up there with the likes of Firefly, Babylon 5, Star Trek, etc.

But the price is way too high.  $60?  For 12 episodes?  That I already have access to as part of Netflix?  No thanks.  I would love to own this, but $60 is a terrible value for 12 half hour episodes.  I recently purchased new Legend of Korra blu ray sets with the same amount of episodes, and their prices are more in the $25 range.  So I will be passing on this and keeping my score here at 1 star until the price comes down by at least half.",1433894400,7,1079,4.308457711442786

This set comes with some neat goodies Like most Limited Editions are ""Supposed"" to have as well as a really nice chipboard box to house the set in.
I never really was into getting Limited Editions of things, However Sentai sure has changed my mind due to there certain allure.

7027174,5,B00U0WY1VM,"I agree with reviewer Alex T in near perfect exactness, save for the occasional choppy frame rates which I personally (And fortunately) did not encounter. However, if I am somehow missing them I'd have to guess they simply aren't enough to take away from the show in the slightest.

Beyond that I hate to merely repeat what's been shared in a few other excellent, and very well done reviews...so I'll just add another nod to the pro column and say ""don't miss this one""! It truly is an amazing series - I cannot wait for the next season!!!

7027175,5,B00U0WY1VM,i watched it on netflix and it was one of the best anime shows i've see so far,1433030400,,78,3.388888888888889
7027176,5,B00U0WY1VM,"This is mature anime science fiction at its finest. I watched it on Netflix but can't wait to own it. Too often anime is dumbed down or simply cannot find the right tone, atmosphere for science fiction. Based on Nihei Tsutomu's manga, also excellent, Knights Of Sidonia is by far and away the best anime science fiction I've seen in some time. I even enjoyed it much more than the popular Attack On Titan. The animation is exceptional. The story is solid. Season Two is airing in Japan in 2015. I can't wait to see it based on these first twelve episodes. It's definitely for a more discerning anime fan. This is absolutely stellar stuff. If it's any indicator other series I have enjoyed and rank among my favorites include Neon Genesis Evangelion, Last Exile, Blue Submarine No. 6, Macross Plus and Yukikaze to name a few. Knights Of Sidonia heads to the top of the A list.",1429660800,16,875,4.544303797468355
7027177,4,B00U0WY1VM,"In what could be over-generalized as a show about humans fighting aliens, Knights of Sidonia is an engaging sci-fi endeavor that fans of the genre and/or anime should give a try. For the same reason, viewers outside the target audience will either love this show or find this one a hard sell. Either way, it needs some explaining of this ""Netflix Original"" (misleading, more like ""Netflix Streaming Exclusive"" instead?).

Besides the option to watch it on Netflix, those who don't use the streaming service can buy a physical copy on Amazon, and it seems to include special features that you could, more or less, probably find online. With a current $50 listing for the Blu-ray, it certainly comes at a premium; for some dying to see Knights of Sidonia, it may very well be a better decision to simply sign up for Netflix instead. As for Netflix users, this is a no-brainer - if you could watch an entire season of House of Cards in one sitting, then surely you can muster the strength to try a half-hour anime episode! You may have already noticed the TV-MA rating for this show; Knights of Sidonia is not for little kids. Alien and robot war violence is frequent here, and some episodes also depict partial nudity. But even ignoring the adult content, the premise and many unfoldings throughout the first season might be too complicated for kids to fully digest anyway.

This brings up the plot. In a future where the carnage of Earth by an alien race named Gauna forces humanity to colonize in spaceships, Sidonia, the name of possibly the last surviving colony ship, houses many of the show's central focuses: genetically engineered, photosynthetic humans, an interchangeable third gender, and Nagate, the main character. Raised in seclusion, he's not like the others and relies on real food for nutrition like normal humans (Ill leave it at that to avoid spoilers on him). Suddenly, his origins and mastery at piloting giant robots sends him to the middle of the action when the conflict between the Gauna and the human race is suddenly reignited for the first time in over a century. From there, the series, written by veteran anime screenwriter Sadayuki Murai (Perfect Blue, Steamboy), revolves around Nagate helping the cause and trying to fit in, as well as uncovering the political and scientific mysteries aboard Sidonia, some of which involve the Gauna themselves.

The animation, handled by Polygon Pictures, can be described as a mix between CGI and a traditional hand-drawn anime design, where the former is cel-stylized to look like the latter. While it takes some getting used to, Knights of Sidonia does get its own distinct presentation as a result. Theres some framerate choppiness here and there (and no, it's not my internet connection), but I didn't notice that issue in any of the more important scenes. Even if some of the character designs and movements could use a little more work, there's a lot to appreciate with how everything looks here. To its credit, the people at Polygon have delivered something that gives off a high production value; in simple language, it looks more expensive than most other anime series right now.

Much of the plot and character interactions are familiar territory thats been covered many times. Even with the interesting gender twist (sadly, it's not as highlighted as other themes - yet), the human melodrama here is fairly standard fare. But what stands out here is its polish and production, both of which are some of the best Ive seen in an anime to date. The world within Knights of Sidonia is ripe with detail and social commentary. It turns out not everyone is happy that Sidonia is choosing to fight the Gauna in the first place, which brings up a very interesting idea the second season will hopefully bring more to the forefront. In addition, Ive never seen an animated space opera coated with such attention to real world physics, as evidenced by its intense galactic battles and Sidonias own intricate setting. That added science makes every bell and whistle that much weightier, and every intense fight - especially Nagates first Gauna kill - that much cooler.

But even with this level of attention, there are still a few areas where the show's logic seems to lapse a bit. For example, as seen in the shows first Gauna encounter, I still can't completely grasp the fact that, after centuries of technological advancements - some of which include genetic engineering AND mechanized robots AND weaponization of a space particle - Sidonias only solution for accelerated diagonal ship movement is a little safety belt with a carabiner. Why would a mass colonization of human life aboard a ship include a sustainable ecosystem and NOT include better safe havens for emergencies, even if they haven't perfected the laws of gravity?

Still, these few areas will not keep someone from enjoying this series. Everything else is well-paced, well-produced, and deeply rooted in post-Earth Sci-Fi. Fans of the genre will undoubtedly have something to like about Knights of Sidonia, whether it's the impressive regard to realism, the unexpectedly intriguing storytelling, or the brawls in space. Others may not buy into the series as quickly, but I think the only way of knowing is watching the entire set of 12 episodes. If anything, it's a great introduction to a very beloved genre in Japanese pop culture. It didn't prove to be wasted time, and it shouldn't be for you.",1428796800,22,5433,4.912854030501089

Second disk has problem in that it will play only one episode, or one 'extra feature', at a time. It freezes my Samsung bd-e5400 blu-ray/dvd player, connected to a Samsung 72 cm series 4000 led tv. When an episode concludes it reverts to the disk menu. Detecting on a new episode  or even the episode just concluded, causes the screen to lock up. Cannot even eject the disk. Only way to continue is shut the power off, and turn it back on. Had to do this with each of the four episodes on the second disk. I now own two of these 'season 1', and the same problem occurs on both of the second disks. The first disk works fine, both sets. Must be a production error with this issue.

7027185,2,B00U0WY1VM,"You hear a lot of strange things about Japan...  but I never quite believed them...  Until I saw Knights of Sidonia.  And then I realized almost every weird thing I'd ever heard must be true, because how else could something like this exist?  How could anyone have thought to produce it, how could anyone have raised the funds necessary to produce it, how could they have found all the people necessary to produce it, and how could anyone make money selling it?  For those things to have all happened Japan must be far stranger than ever I have allowed myself to believe.

This has all the weird Japan tropes, too...  It's got an inexplicable bear with a prosthetic arm acting as a human, it's got mech warrior-ish jet-robot-piloted machines, it's got people wearing freakish masks for no apparent reason, it's got constant lessons about honor/duty/sacrifice, it's got a super shy, awkward teen underdwelling misfit wunderkind who is somewhere between asexual (seems too shy to even hold a girl's hand) and ubersexual (everyone wants him him desperately) who has an abundance of females to choose from but instead is attracted to a freakish, tentacled, slightly phallic space being imbued with the essence of a former friend / crush.  Dozens of hours in, the main character has now sufficiently embraced his love for the alien hybrid tentacled creature that he buys a house to be closer to it and they spoon and go to sleep.  Something in my brain snapped at that moment and I just couldn't take it any longer.  My brain said, ""Thanks, but I've now had enough for a lifetime.""  And thus ends my little experiment with anime.

7027186,2,B00U0WY1VM,"This anime makes some really weird decisions.  Much of the setting is interesting but it is so rife with unjustified tropes as to be nonsensical (a horse of giggling clones, a bear woman, a rich noble on the socialistic works, boundless natural resources on a ship).

 I chose to watch this on the premise it was like Battlestar Galactica. It falls utterly flat.  There's none of the political machinations or senses of scarcity.  It's all just so thick with tropes as to be perpetually predictable.",1447027200,,499,4.823529411764706

7027189,3,B00U0WY1VM,"I love this anime and I've gone off the deep end as far as full immersion into the story. I've purchased all 14 original Japanese manga volumes, as well as the Japanese theatrical version and this Season 1 Blu Ray.

I have a major gripe about this Blu Ray release, however. There isn't an option to watch the Japanese audio version without sub-titles. You may be thinking, ""What's the big deal, it's just sub-titles,"" and in some other movies, I may agree. However, there are many scenes in this series where there's a lot of Japanese text that's displayed, and the English translations completely block the Japanese words in the middle of the screen, making it not only disruptive, but impossible to read the Japanese characters. This is a major distraction from the film, and I would have much preferred to have the option to turn off the sub-titles altogether. Perhaps somebody more technically inclined can educate me on how to do this, but I haven't been able to find a way to do this.

If you're a hardcore fan of this series, and if you also happen to be a native Japanese speaker or someone who understands Japanese and doesn't want sub-titles, you've been warned. FYI, Amazon Japan sells the Japanese market Blu Ray (Region A so they should play on US Blu Ray players), albeit at much higher prices, but the extremely invasive sub-titles ruined this so much that I'm going to go ahead and order the Japanese market Blu Rays and pay the premium for it. Also FYI, the second season (9th planet wars) is already available in the Japanese market.

I realize that this review is very specific to Japanese speaking Americans and native speakers who live abroad, but as a fan of this series, I felt strongly enough to write this review and perhaps influence the US distributor to issue a release without the intrusive ""sub-titles"" in the future.",1445644800,4,1847,4.694444444444445

This is exactly why people get turned off when trying to buy physical copies these days, too much freaking DRM. I torrented this anime the first time. People will buy physical copies in anticipation for another follow up of a series, that's how the video industry gets funded. It is the fault of both ASUS for cheating me and the format itself that I have to deal with all this copyright BS just to watch a blu ray disk on my pc. There is no way in hell I am buying an $84 f*****g program, I should have just been able to put the disc in the tray, close, and play it in any player of my choosing.

8703781,1,B00U0WY1VM,"if you're looking for fanfare here--it's not to be found.  I am going to try to curb my criticism but it's going to be really difficult.

I want to write this to give people with a similar perspective a frame of reference, in terms of what they can reasonably expect.

I'm an 80s baby, that means I grew up watching Voltron, Transformers, Robotech, etc., on network television.  That spawned my life-long love affair with anime and Japanese-style animated series, OVAs, etc..

That being said, since I'm clearly an older fan, maybe my years of consuming this stuff has culled my palate and therefore I have less tolerance for the below-average content (which is what you'll find here, if you ask me).

I know that is going to offend fans but I don't care--all I have to say in defense is that if you have seen the series I have seen and objectively accept that there are far better models to follow than the cliches which now flood the genre (teens have unlimited latent potential to save the universe yet can't master something as simple as basic social skills with the opposite sex--an homage to the repressed social mores of Japanese society--it's already been done).  And with anime now teeming with so many copycat series, it makes the good ones (few and far between) stand out even more.  I can't stomach crap like this anymore.

If you want enjoy any aspects of this--there are better archetypes to watch.  If you're into the whole fan-service thing where tons of girls clamor after one boy, waaaay better series to watch than this pretentious mockery.  I'd recommend Tochi Muyo--which probably set the bar for those kinds of series.

If you're into giant mecha anime, Pick some of the original Gundam series--even Robotech's Macross saga with is ridiculously dated storyline is better than the mecha story arc to be found here.

There are so many good anime out there that if you remain objective--you'd have no choice but to give this a poor rating because, relatively speaking--it is a very mediocre entry to the genre.

What is my frame of reference, you might wonder?  Well, I'm partial to classics both old--like Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Berserk (original TV series (1999ish, if I recall correctly), Ninja Scroll, Fist Of The North Star, Inuyasha, Rurouni Kenshin, Cowboy Bebop--things with pretty original themes (for their time) or exceptional story/character/animation development...and new stuff too--like Sword Of The Stranger, A'Jin, Blame! (future classic), Basilisk (fleshed out koga ninja scroll storyline--the whole ""ninja scroll"" story), Karas, or Samurai Champloo.

I'm sure things can be found to be criticized in all of those--but you'll find that they are strong reasons to watch anime--and when you have seen those--this just pales.  Knights of Sidonia didn't do anything exceptionally well, except some unique aspects of life in space but that alone wasn't enough to compensate for the overwhelmingly annoying juvenile aspects and pathologically-obsessive personalities of the characters.

So if you think you might have a similar perspective on anime--give this a hard pass.

I am so tired of such a dominant theme of teenagers with maladjusted personalities being the central protagonists.  I'm about ready to give up on anime because of it--I can't relate to that crap anymore (if I ever did???).",1528329600,,3333,5.047445255474453

And visually they story is taken to the next level. The animation in this is some of the best going around. And man, some of the space battles are awesome, as well as quieter moments in a floating city in space (keep your eyes peeled for the underwater scene with aquatic life).
