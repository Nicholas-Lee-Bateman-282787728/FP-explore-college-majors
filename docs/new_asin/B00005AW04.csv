1419021,3,B00005AW04,"If ever a series deserved a posthumous made-for-TV movie, it's Homicide.  The original series was cancelled in 1999, only a few weeks notice before season's end.  Consequently, the series finale was admittedly hurried, disjointed, and inconclusive.  One of the greatest series ever deserved a more punctuated conclusion.  To this end, Homicide's creative team managed to convince NBC to let them make ""Homicide:  The Movie"".
The premise of ""Homicide:  The Movie"" is ingenious (for those who don't know):  Lt. Giardello (""Gee"" for short) is the controversial frontrunner in the Baltimore mayoral race, whose principle issue is the decriminalization of drugs.  During a campaign stop he is shot (but not killed) by an unknown assailant.  Subsequently, every regular character from the series (and I mean everyone) returns to investigate the crime and visit Gee.  [This premise is so good, it's frustrating as a fan.  If NBC had given the show one more season (and let them know it would be the last) there could've been some intriguing episodes leading to the campaign.]
In a sense it's nice to see every regular character back one last time, but it also creates a dilemma:  overcrowding.  With so many characters (more than 20) the story is spread thinly over it's 90 min. duration.  There are many pointless, uninteresting scenes, which only serve to give some members of the bloated cast face time:  Shepherd and Ballard repeatedly view videotape of the shooting for leads; Mike Giardello and Kellerman roust everyone who might carry a grudge; Med. Examiners discuss emergency advancements at Gee's hospital bed.  These aren't limited examples, about half of all the film's scenes are disposable.  What probably would've been a superb 40 min. series finale' is often flimsy as a 90 min. film.
Fortunately, the glaring flaws are largely redeemed in the last 15 min.  The conclusion is set up pefectly and comes as a complete and devestating surprise; yet it's entirely believable and satisfying in the spirit of the original series.  Even if ""Homicide:  The Movie"" is more than a little diluted, it works as an appropriately bitter-sweet coda for one of the best series in the history of television.",1011052800,16,2199,5.106442577030812
1419022,3,B00005AW04,"Homicide: Life on the Street chose to be different from the word go. The gritty, almost black and white photography in the first few seasons, the zooming camera effects, the way the actors didn't wear make-up separated it from other cop shows. The quality of the actors, especially Andre Braugher, also made a done-to-death genre that much more interesting.
Homicide did a lot of things incredibly well: arc stories (such as Luther Mahoney and the Kellerman storyline), drug abuse and dealt with racial issues brilliantly. It was also set in Baltimore, not New York, Boston, LA or Chicago which was refreshing.
What we're left with here is 90 minutes of a weak story reuniting characters that only have a couple of minutes of airtime. Perhaps the most frustrating is the reliance on Giardello's son who rarely featured in the original series. Pembleton and Bayliss get their fair share but Lewis for example hardly gets a look in. What this should really have been is something as epic as the Sniper storyline from the 3rd or 4th season which spanned 3 episodes not a bittersweet reuniting of characters to find the shooter of Al Giardello. The identity of the shooter is nothing special, and in the last 15 minutes the real drama actually happens (and it's worth waiting for).
If NBC want to really impress Homicide fans a DVD box-set of the best episodes including the pilot would be much more welcome, the show's best storylines were in the first 4 years of the show.",995846400,12,1470,4.791338582677166

1419024,5,B00005AW04,"I've seen this movie, it's really superb. I was really happy with the ending of the show with this TV movie totally filmed on location in Baltimore City. I first found out about this movie on my local news, They said that the mayor (former mayor now) Kurt Schmoke will have a cameo role in the movie, Schmoke told some tidbits on the movie but not much. A few months later, it was aired on NBC, I was so excited. Surely enough, in one scene Kurt Schmoke was in the movie. I really liked how the movie was directed and how the actors portrayed their roles. Really excellent movie.",990230400,,579,4.321100917431193
1419025,4,B00005AW04,"Homicide: Life Everlasting was the perfect way to wrap-up the show which lasted for 7 seasons on NBC. This two-hour movie originally aired during the month of February of 2000, reunites new and old member of the cast...some more than others in a very clever and subtle way.
The basic plot of the movie goes like this: Former Lt. Al Giardello of the Homicide Unit is running as a mayoral candidate for the city of Baltimore(or as pronounced in the actual city Bawlmer). Gee is shot while giving a speech at the Inner Harbor. He is rushed to the hospital and enroute to the hospital scenes are cut back and forth between each former or current Detective of the Homicide Unit who are informed of the incident including Andre Braugher(Det. Frank Pembleton)who has given up being a cop to teach and Kyle Secor(Det. Tim Bayliss)who had taken a leave-of-absence from the unit at the end of the series.
Other former members of the squad making appearances in the movie are Reed Diamond(Det. Mike Kellerman - now a P.I.),Melissa Leo(Sgt. Kay Howard), Richard Belzer(Det. John Munch), Clark Johnson(Det. Meldrick Lewis), Isabella Hoffman(Megan Russert), and Max Perlich(J.H. Brodie). Gee's son Mike Giardello also appears in the movie as a beat(street)cop after he left the FBI at the close of the series.
This movie is a must see for die-hard fans of the show longing to see former cast members that actually made the show great. And to leave you on an intriguing and interesting note: The ending is a complete SHOCKER!!! Don't miss out on getting this movie for anything in the world. It's the perfect thing for any die-hard Homicide fan and a movie no Homicide fan should be without.",986169600,16,1676,4.802768166089965
1419026,5,B00005AW04,"Considering how many actors had regular or semi-regular roles during ""Homicide's"" seven-year run on NBC, one could be forgiven for thinking that the most remarkable thing about this TV movie is that all of the regulars (and many of the semi-regulars) were back for what is probably the final go-round. And while that is probably a record for such reunions, it should not obscure the fact that this program (also known as ""Homicide: Life Everlasting"") tells a pretty good story in its own right.
In this case, I am not referring to the plot-line of the homicide squad's former commander, Al Giardello, being shot and the past and present members of his squad banding together to find the shooter. While that plot-line provides a credible reason for reuniting the team and gives viewers a final chance to revel in the way that ""Homicide"" emphasized the deductive skill of its detectives over their abilities with firearms, it's simply a means to an end. More often than not, the heart of ""Homicide's"" stories was the people behind the badges more so than the crimes they investigated.
Giardello's shooting is a cause for anger for some and reflection for others. In the case of Detective Bayliss, the reunion with his former partner Frank Pembleton (played by Emmy-winner Andre Braugher) and uncovering the mystery behind the shooting forces him to confront notions of right and justice which had been haunting him for months. This actually provides the movie's most dramatic scene, in the form of a powerful confrontation between Bayliss and Pembleton which almost certainly changes one man's life forever.
As for the other detectives, as some have observed, they don't really get a whole lot to do in the course of the film beyond eliminating various ""red herrings"" which allow Bayliss and Pembleton to get to the heart of the case. Here again, the investigation of crime is somewhat beside the point and secondary to the joy of seeing beloved (and in a couple cases hated) characters together again. In addition to the long-running partnership between Bayliss and Pembleton, we also get to see Richard Belzer and Ned Beatty as Munch and Bolander, still agreeing to disagree at nearly every turn. Of the original squad, only detectives Lewis and Howard are not reunited with their former partners, those detectives having been killed during the run of the show. That said, both of those characters, Steve Crosetti and Beau Felton, do make an appearance in what is probably the movie's most heartfelt scene.
Whether one is a long-time fan or someone new to ""Homicide,"" the end result of watching this movie will most likely be an attempt to track down either re-runs (currently on Court TV) or other video releases from the series (of which there are few available). Even at its worst, ""Homicide"" was always worth watching, and at its best it was simply marvelous. This film is arguably not the very best episode of the program's run, but it is certainly an excellent reminder of how good television can be when a talented group of creative artists come together with the intention to make something really good.",985737600,27,3111,4.927619047619047
1419027,4,B00005AW04,"Whilst the final episode of the seventh season of Homicide: Life on the Street bookended the show - starting and ending in the same place - loose ends, or rather one very long loose end, was left dangling.
Homicide: The Movie picks up some months after the show ended and it's all change. Al Giadello want to be the Mayor of Baltimore, Gharty is the new shift commander, Bayliss uncertain of his future, is on a sabbatical. It's not giving away much to say that Gee gets shot and squad members past and present return to catch the shooter.
After the disaster of Season 7, the prospect of former cast members of the calibre of Andre Braugher, Ned Beatty and Melissa Leo was more than welcome. Sadly squeezing in so many past characters leaves many with little to do, whilst the main (and rather thin) plotline of Gee's shooting is just an excuse to get Braugher and the excellent Kyle Secor back on screen together.  Not that that's a bad thing.
Watching familiar faces and listening to the long missed banter of the detectives reinforced the view that Homicide was strangely overshadowed by inferior, and less intelligent shows like NYPD Blue, and that it never quite got the credit it deserved.",984787200,15,1195,4.6635071090047395
1419047,3,B00005AW04,"Do you remember the final season of ""Homicide: Life on the Street?"" It was so young. Perhaps this adjective comes to mind because of the set redesign. Fresh paint and new furniture replaced the shabby and worn--and in the Season 6 finale, blood stained and bullet ridden--squad room that we knew. Perhaps the departure of Det. Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), the one stable married man, and the introduction of the stunning and single Det. Rene Sheppard (Michael Michele), a pageant winner turned cop, contributed to this youthful atmosphere.

Or perhaps antics more appropriate to hormone-crazed teenagers than seasoned homicide detectives infused that last season with its immaturity. We did have Detectives John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) competing for the affections of Billie Lou (Ellie McElduff), the Waterfront barmaid. And then we watched Det. Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne) confess her crush on colleague Paul Falsone (Jon Seda), who, at first, had eyes only for the former pageant queen. When Det. Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor) explored his bisexuality, bullying and ostracism, typical school ground behaviors, ensued. Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), empathetic to the youthful energy that filled the squad room, managed his detectives as would an affectionate teacher, and when situations required a more strict disciplinarian, Capt. Gaffney (Walt MacPherson) swaggered in, principal-style, to crush the fun.

If Season 7 (1998-99) resembled high school homeroom, then ""Homicide: The Movie"" (2000) is graduation. We recognize the significance of the occasion--that this is it--and so enjoy the opportunity to see all of our favorites one last time. But like the freedom and possibilities that await matriculating seniors, we are itching to abandon this cohort of characters and discover what's next on the television horizon.

Kudos to writers Tom Fontana, Eric Overmyer, and James Yoshimura for concocting a story where dozens of ""Homicide"" characters can make reasonably logical appearances. The movie opens with our beloved Lt. Gee--now a mayoral candidate--gunned down during a campaign appearance. As news of the shooting spreads, we get to see our favorites interrupted in lives we don't know--Stanley Bollander (Ned Beatty) having his first beer with breakfast, a bearded Bayliss fly fishing in a lonely stream, Pembleton lecturing college students on morality--all to Beck's haunting and weird ""Beautiful Way.""

A ""Homicide"" initiate would understand that Gee had amassed such loyalty and good will during his tenure with the Baltimore PD that detectives current, retired, fired--together with medical examiners and prosecutors--would rush to investigate the crime and punish his would-be assassin. But to a viewer unfamiliar with this world, the support Gee gets is illogical. A black politician who campaigns to make hard drugs--heroin and the like--legal gets law enforcement officers and prosecutors--many of whom are white--racing to his aid? In what universe? Try explaining those conditions to folks watching this investigation as their first introduction to the story and cast. Better to have named this ""movie"" ""Homicide: The Last, Long Episode,"" as it certainly doesn't work as a stand-alone film.

But, really, this movie is for fans. And the writing and acting are often so good that a character's full personality blooms after a few seconds of screen time. We see, for example, that Gharty, the cowardly patrolman inexplicably promoted to homicide detective, has now made the even more illogical leap to lieutenant, where he struggles to remain afloat on his own incompetence. So that we remember the racism that plagues Baltimore (or perhaps to see the new lieutenant's bad decision making), Gharty sends two black detectives, Sheppard and Lewis (Clark Johnson), to interview the white supremacists and the white Bolander and Munch to interview black suspects on the religious fringe. The hungry press allow Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) to go Italian hothead on unfortunate reporters wanting news of his father's condition, while former Capt. Megan Russert (Isabella Hofmann), the wise mother figure, drapes her arm around anyone needing comfort.

Sometimes, though, the conversation is a bit forced, like when medical examiners Drs. Cox (Michelle Forbes) and Griscom (Austin Pendleton) use their hospital visit to examine Gee's wound and debate the caliber of weapon used. The Dr. Cox we know would have delivered a spot-on insight about life and death, or at least touched Gee's hand, as their working relationship had demonstrated mutual respect and affection. But such are the little disappointments viewers can expect when the characters must pass the story like a baton as they sprint through the relay race to showcase seven years of cast.

Of course, the most important interaction--Bayliss's rooftop confession to Pembleton--is the most disappointing. You can't fault Braugher and Secor's acting. They shout, gesture, cringe, and foam with real passion. But the words themselves are flat. The characters haven't grown. Bayliss is still a little boy needing Pembleton to be the rigid disciplinarian. And with this scene--as we try to imagine how Bayliss and Pembleton will suffer once they climb down the stairs--we know it's time to move on. The ""Homicide"" characters remain in a behavior loop that has grown tiresome and old.

And look at what was on the horizon! In two short years, David Simon would bring to life a Baltimore of more grit and id in ""The Wire,"" inarguably the best series in television history.",1352505600,,5585,5.4188722669735325
1419048,4,B00005AW04,"There is a tendency in David Mamet's work -- or is it a weakness? -- to force the main character to behave out of character in order to set up the tragic ending.

In HOUSE OF GAMES, Lindsay Krause, ostensibly the objective observer who wants to write a book about con men, suddenly says to Joe Mantegna, ""Let me join you in this caper."" A move that will in the end undo her.

In HOMICIDE, Mantegna, ostensibly the objective cop who is investigating the murder of an old Jewish woman in a candy store, suddenly says to one of the militant Jews he encounters, ""Please, let me go with you. Let me help you blow up the store that publishes anti-Semitic literature."" This leads to his undoing when he learns that the key word ""grofaz"" (Hitler) was actually ""grofazt"" (a bird food).

The movies are interesting, so you don't notice the flaws right away. But once you've noticed them, it's hard to ignore them.

It could be argued that Mamet is articulating a weakness of character in the protagonist. Dr. Margaret Ford has criminal tendencies of her own, so it is not so remarkable that she joins the con men in order to stimulate herself. Robert Gold in HOMICIDE is ambivalent about his own Jewishness, and his guilt drives him to join the militant Jews as a sort of expiation for an entire life spent denying his heritage.

Still, the sudden changes in character motivation are jarring. ""Couldn't she have defeated the con men without joining them? Couldn't Gold have found the killer of the old lady without compromising himself by helping the militant terrorists?""

It's never good to have a character behave out of character. Not in movies, not in books, not on TV.

The flaw, the inconsistency, may be in the character of Mamet himself. He may be projecting his own ambivalence onto his characters, much as an abstract expressionist painter creates a complex canvas behind which are hidden his own weaknesses, his own obsessions.

He is capable of creating a consistent character, viz. William Macy in Oleanna. Macy remains the same, while the first and second acts put him in wildly different situations.

As Mamet got older, his movies got worse and worse. The Spanish Prisoner, Heist, are not good movies. I've always felt that Mamet reached for effects which his talent couldn't quite attain.

Ultimately the flaw is in the eye of the beholder. Shakespeare, Sophocles, the Bible, James Joyce, Scott Fitzgerald, all are guilty of hazy character motivation at some point. It may be, as Freud suggests, that the purpose of literature (and by extension all art) is to make us overlook these flaws in order to fascinate us, to entertain us. It's called ""dramatic license,"" ""poetic license.""",1323561600,,2689,4.788336933045357

1419051,4,B00005AW04,"First, I must say my wife and I love and cherish this series. Having never seen the series when it originally aired, and after purchasing the beautiful 'filing cabinet' series set, we poured over each season in order over a several month period one summer. On occasion we could have watched whole seasons in marathon sessions, but forced ourselves to only watch one or two episodes at a time just so we could appreciate and savor it even more.

***SPOILERS FOLLOW***

That said, I can't help but feel the writers of both the series and this closing movie really missed a golden opportunity. Recall the the whole series began with rookie Det. Tim Bayliss' being assigned a case that would haunt and torture him throughout the rest of the series - the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson.

Despite hours of air-time being devoted to the pursuit of this case, culminating in a stunning episode shot entirely in the interrogation room (""The Box""), the characters and viewer never discover the full truth surrounding Adena Watson's murder. As the series progresses Det. Bayliss would periodically be confronted with references and reminders of this painful 'first case'. Doesn't it make perfect sense that the very case that introduced this series to the world, and that left tantalizing bread crumbs throughout the seasons that followed, should be dealt with in the final episode of the series? Or at least been given time in the closing movie that followed?

Adena Watson was the perfect cliff hanger. As each season progressed I just knew that her case was coming back - when? we didn't know. And as the series neared it's end, it became clear that the writers were saving this one for the finale. And why not? It made perfect sense. Closing the Adena Watson case would be the ultimate in 'closure' for this show.

Now, don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting everything to end with all the loose strands tied up in pretty bows. This wasn't Law & Order after all (a show we also enjoy for it's own merits). Many of Homicide's story lines ended messily. But so do many of the events of real life as well. And that is what made this series gritty and compelling. Nevertheless, of all the haunting cases in the series, this is the one that deserved some measure of 'closure' even if it wasn't going to be neat and clean.

I have to say, while we still look back on the series with fondness, there is a bit of disappointment that this golden opportunity was overlooked. After all, if even the Luther Mahoney story arc saw a measure of 'closure', I believe poor Adena Watson deserved it even more.

1419056,4,B00005AW04,"The premise of Homicide: The Movie is very simple. The former shift commander of the Baltimore Homicide unit is shot down by an unknown assailant while campaigning for the job of mayor. All of his past comrades rally to find the shooter. Problem is, there are just too many characters to fit effectively into the movie given the time frame. If you watch closely, you can tell that even the writers know which characters deserve more screen time. The two who receive the most (deservedly so) are Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor.) Their reunion is awkward and full of unspoken tension that eventually boils over into a rooftop confrontation that proves to be the finest scene in the entire movie. Its ironic that said confrontation doesn't deal directly with the plot of the movie, but has a sharp baring on the past series. In true Homicide fashion, the movie does wrap up some loose ends, but it poses new questions by answering old ones, especially where Bayliss and Pembleton are concerned. Its also worth noting that another ghostly scene involving two dead characters, Steve Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin) is very effective as a closer, even though it seems to run contrary to the gritty realism of the entire series.

Other past regulars are a welcome sight. John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Stan Bolander (Ned Beatty) have an easy time resurrecting the antagonistic banter that was often a comical relief point in the early part of the series. Kay Howard (Melissa Leo) and Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson) prove rock solid and don't seem to have missed a beat since the series went off the air. Other newer and lesser liked characters such as Paul Falsone (Jon Seda) and Renee Sheppard (Michael Michele) receive very little screen time and this just can't be a coincidence. Bumping the wormy Stew Gharty (Peter Gerety) up to shift commander was understandable, given the dirty nature of office politics often high-lighted in the show.

While the movie does bring us classic Homicide drama, it also mixes in some of the gimmicky plot elements that proved to be the show's undoing in its final year. The idea of Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) being shot is certainly believable, but its hard to understand why he'd run for mayor when he was always disgusted by upstairs politics. Its also hard to care about his son, Mike (Giancarlo Esposito), as we watch him grieve for his father. Mike was a bad plot point from the beginning and is a waste of screen time when there are better characters on which to focus. Such characters include Megan Russert (Isabella Hofmann), Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond), Juliana Cox (Michelle Forbes) and J. H. Brodie (Max Perlich), who receive mere seconds of camera exposure by comparison. Still, with all of its flaws, and with no DVD extras to speak of, Homicide's final movie is worth the watch and is a must for any fan's collection.",1122854400,4,2918,4.845691382765531

It seems like the writers tried too hard to combine the stellar writing and performances of seasons 1-6 with the less intense workings of season 7.

For fans of the show, this is a great way to say goodbye to pembleton, bayliss, bolander, giardello and  the rest of the squad. It's a worthwhile addition to the collection.",1122595200,,646,4.420168067226891

1419068,5,B00005AW04,"The HOMICIDE MOVIE WAS A FITTING END TO A GREAT SERIES. The HOMICIDE Movie was great because it was anchored in a grabbing central storyline involving the beloved Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) while still allowing for subplots that helped tie up loose plot ends from the series, all without becoming a cheesy reunion show. I have always been a fan of detective shows, but HOMICIDE grabbed me in a different way. The stories were so gritty and examined many elements of the human condition in the cops and the criminals, alike. Executive Producer Tom Fontana managed to carry this feeling over to his HBO hit OZ, which I highly recommend to HOMICIDE fans. While the earliest seasons of HOMICIDE (1-3) were the best, all of the seasons have merit, because the acting always stayed strong and the plots intriguing. My favorite episodes of all time are the ""the pilot""(Season 1) and ""crosetti""(Season 3). I was dissapointed when I heard HOMICIDE was cancelled, but I was exicited when I heard this movie coming out. I thought to myself, how are they going to have all of the HOMICIDE characters return in this movie? Well, they pulled it off with class and grace. Seeing the ghost of the little girl, Adina Watson (the first case in season 1, which remained unsolved), and how deceased detectives Felton and Crosetti fit into the plot, managed to put the whole series in perspective, again making me realize what a great television show HOMICIDE had been. It was great because it made me care about the characters; I loved the banter that certain pairs such as Munch and Bolander, Bayliss and Pembleton, and Crosetti and Lewis shared.

Watching the series from season one every Friday night was a real treat in the 90's, but unfortunately the characters changed every year. Whether you loved them or hated them, all the detectives are here, from the M.E. to the camera man,to the brass. Including the ones who had died on the series. When their beloved ""G"" gets shot they all come back from retirement and other jobs to find the shooter. Everyone has a part in the investigation and new detective Jason Priestly gets slapped down quickly so that he doesn't ruin this great reunion. Eamon Walker from the series Oz has a small but important role and the whole cast makes this movie work well. While the investigation rolls, some loose ends from the series are tied up, and Bayliss makes a stunning revelation to Pembleton. It was great to see actors Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, and now director of feature films Clark Johnson back at work.

1419070,4,B00005AW04,"Most of the other reviewers have recapped the storyline well and mentioned such ""lowlights"" as many former cast members with too little air time.  That said, it matters not whether you have been a fan of the Homicide TV series or are just finding out about it, this movie is worth seeing.  What others have mentioned as a ""thin"" storyline with a surprise ending is reasonable but misplaced criticism.  The ending of this movie not only recaptures some of the genius of the series (memorable final scenes) but also subliminally ""invites"" the viewer to find out more about the characters who are in the final episode, especially the last scene.  That can only be done by watching all of the shows from seasons 1 thru 5, at least.  So, the finale of this excellent series is, in fact, an invitation to enjoy the gritty, gripping acting and highly entertaining stories of the entire series.  I've watched every show of every season, including this one, at least 3 times, and I think that viewers will enjoy this movie on its own merits, but will appreciate it even more by watching more of the shows that made this series GREAT.",1093392000,3,1124,4.651515151515151
1419071,4,B00005AW04,"This proved to be a worthy, if not tragic, ending for what diehard fans called ""The Best D**n Show on Television."" Being one of those fans, I was torn. On the one hand, I honestly felt ""Homicide"" didn't need a wrap-up movie. The ending of the televsion series, I thought, was about as satisfying as we fans were going to get under the circumstances.
On the other hand, well, it was my favorite show, for cryin' out loud! I wanted to see how the creators would put it to rest.

BTW, for those of you who didn't keep up with the televion series, this is NOT the DVD to start with! Start with ""Seasons I and II"" and work your way up!
Back to the review: The storyline is as follows: Al Giardello, former Homicide Unit L-T, is now running for Mayor of Charm City (On, if you can believe it, a drug legalization platform) and has a very impressive lead, that is until he's gunned down while giving a speech. All cast members are reunited as they struggle to investigate the shooting of their beloved ""Gee"" as he lies in intensive care.
At times, the writing is only mediocre and there are moments when the movie seemed preoccupied with giving every single reunited cast member a line or a scene. Nonetheless, the shocking and sad ending was worth every minute and has some incredible acting from Kyle Secor and Andre Braugher.
I wouldn't want to give anything away save this: the writers don't take the usual route and certainly do not wrap everything up with a ""happily ever after"" ending. And, looking back on the series, it makes all the sense in the world.",1089676800,31,1555,4.456140350877193

1419073,3,B00005AW04,"Returning on occasion to the job I left almost three years ago, and which I held for over four years, I am constantly reminded of how much things change. And the feeling of awkwardness and unease still permeates throughout each and every one of my visits. The place looks different. Many, if not most, of the faces have changed. Life has moved on without me there. Watching ""Homicide: The Movie"" evokes much the same feeling within me. The TV movie was produced only a short half-year after the series ended production, yet so much was different. The result is somewhat jarring, yet still acceptable. Life does, indeed, move on. Why should ""Homicide"" be any different?
The major driving force behind ""Homicide: The Movie"" was to reunite as many of ""Homicide: Life on the Street's"" cast members as possible. How does one accomplish this? The answer comes in the form of having a man that many of the characters liked (or at least respected) get shot down. Former Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) is running for mayor of Baltimore, when he is gunned down at a rally. He is rushed to the hospital, and news of his brush with death spreads quickly throughout the area. Soon, every single one of the living detectives who had worked in the Homicide unit during the series' run have returned to the squad room. Much has changed since the time that they were there. Only one of the show's original characters, Meldrick Lewis, is still an active detective in the unit. Stu Gharty, a man many people did not respect, is now the shift lieutenant. The squad room is painted blue. And Jason Priestley (of 90210 fame) has joined the cast as a brash, new detective.
The detectives (old and new) begin to investigate the shooting of Al Giardello. John Munch & Stanley Bolander (Richard Belzer & Ned Beatty) re-unite and work together, as do the popular Frank Pembleton & Tim Bayliss (Andre Braugher & Kyle Secor). If there is a problem with ""Homicide: The Movie"", it is that in its quest to bring together the over 20 regular and semi-regular (as well as guest-starring) members of the cast of the original show, the usage of that cast is spread very thin. In fact, as it was when the series was on the air, the plot basically revolves around Pembleton & Bayliss. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as they are two of the show's strongest characters. It is simply a matter of time allowance. It had been years since Ned Beatty had been on the show, and perhaps a bit more time devoted to his character wouldn't have been such a bad thing. Or that of Melissa Leo's strong role as Sgt. Kay Howard (another favorite). At any rate, it was interesting to see everyone come back together again, one last time -- even the ""dead"" characters.
There are some twists and turns in ""Homicide: The Movie"", as well as a couple of surprises. One of them is semi-predictable, if you'd followed the series up to its final episode. Still, it is devastating. The plot line of investigating Giardello's shooting progresses well enough, although sometimes it feels haphazard, as certain scenes are thrown in, simply for sake of providing something for each of the cast members to do. The last few scenes, once the shooting is solved, provide both a nice, and a not-so-nice coda for the characters that fans of the show grew to know and identify with over the series' seven season run.
In the end, ""Homicide: The Movie"" seems concerned with wrapping things up, and with tidying loose ends left over from the final episode. I'm not sure whether or not I like this. In many ways, the last episode left things in a way which seemed more natural. Not every answer was solved, not every character's destination was known. Now, with ""The Movie"", we have almost more answers and finality than I find desirable. It made me pine for the show's early years, when it was simply a deep, gritty, and heartfelt cop show. Ah, those were the days.",1063152000,15,3894,4.644927536231884
1419074,4,B00005AW04,"'Homocide the movie' is a fitting conclusion to the best crime series ever made.  It was especially nice to see the past members of the series again and some new members.  I don't believe the film had the same edginess that we saw in the Tv series but it does gives us an insight into how each character has progressed since the series ended.  If anyone saw the last ever episode of the series they will be especially interested in watching the film because we learn about how one of the homocide team have a rather dark confession to make. I won't say anymore on this issue as I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  The film itself has a good storyline and immidiately starts with former Homocide captain Al Giardello now running for mayor of Baltimore.  But, at a pubic political speech he is shot and seriously hurt.  We then see all the members of the Homocide squad, past and present come together to try and apprehend the shooter.  As the detectives interview every possible suspect it becomes apparent that the key piece of evidence is a local TV cameraman's videotape of what happened that morning.  There are special appearances from 'Oz' star Eammon Walker and 'Beverly Hills 90210' star Jason Priestly. I have been a huge fan of 'Homocide: Life on the street' since it first started and as I watched the end of this film there was a genuine feeling of sadness because it wraps everything up; who's going where, who's doing what, and it lets us know that this is the end, there will be no more 'Homocide'.",1028332800,7,1514,4.52014652014652
1419075,4,B00005AW04,"HOMICIDE, the TV show was a product of ""Mr. Baltimore,"" Barry Levinson, of ""Diner"" and other movies featuring Baltimore, the city. Back in the days when I really cared about what I watched on TV, I watched ""Homicide,"" which really was a lot harder than it seems in retrospect because NBC kept bouncing it around the schedule. Just in its first year-and-a-half, it was on Wednesday, Thursday AND Friday nights.
Brandon Tarkoff at NBC programming really liked the show, but it was too gritty, too raw, too everything to really build an audience, but NBC did try... they put it following the Superbowl its second year, and the audience was there for a few weeks, then the numbers went down.
How it survived, I sure don't know. Maybe it was all of the recognition we gave it at the Viewers for Quality Television (VQT). Maybe it was all of the Emmy nominations, but if you like what you see while watching ""CSI,"" ""ER,"" ""Law and Order"" or any past show that's a lot better than the rest, watching this made for TV movie, ""Homicide,"" shows you where all the best of those shows came from... the heritage of those shows is in this one.
When ""Homicide"" was cancelled in 1999, it was not a surprise to those who watched it regularly, but given its history, its cancellation caused for there to be a Scotch taped together finale that left the viewers unsatisfied. To that end, this made-for-TV movie was broadcast with all the detectives, old and new, present.
It's a powerful made-for-TV movie, much like those TV movies in the past who were so strong that a series was spawn from them. Unfortunately, ""Homicide"" had already had its run, but a better remembrance is difficult to find.
This movie, at its lower price, is priced just about right.  However, when it was over $20.00 it was worth the money I spent just for the memories of Frank, Stanley, Munch, Al, et. al.
The plot...forget the plot, it's there, and it's better than most shows, maybe not a strong as other episodes, but what's more important are the actors; and, with this movie, you get them all, again.
In summation, buy it to see what good TV, along the lines of those classic shows, like Playhouse 90, were in the 50's, only better. But, be sure to stick around for the final scene. Those final scenes were always great: Whether they show Frank Pembleton in his dress uniform, standing at attention, sword drawn as the casket of Crosetti goes by; or maybe that Christmas episode, when the squad start a snowball fight while Chrissie Hyde sings ""Have yourself a Very Merry Christmas"" is played in the background. ""Homicide: The Movie"" has a great final scene, too, that somehow leaves everything stired-up normal again.",1015804800,8,2678,4.673728813559322
7936010,2,B00005AW04,"Homicide: Life On The Streets the TV show lost alot of its luster in Season 7. They seemed to have been desperate to find new angles and to find a new audience. The result was a watered down version of what the show once was. It once was edgy and the personal lives of the characters was more ingrained into each episode. By season 7, these character developing details sort of lie on the surface while the story of the case in each episode had a beginning, middle and an end.

The highlight of season 7 is how it ended and that ending makes much more sense than the ending in Homicide - The Movie. The season's finale was also the series finale. Things were wrapped up nicely. Most series ends with loose ends. We can assume how things turn out and they are subjective. Season 7 ended with Gee being offered a promotion but he ultimately decides to turn it down and stay with what he does all series long because he wants to be closer to what is happening in the streets. In the movie, he decides to run for office? Be a politician? Doesn't make sense. But, they needed something to bring all of the surviving characters together right? So Gee is shot at a campaign stop. That brings cost members back from season one on back and that's why I give this three stars.

Ensemble casts are a struggle for actor's to get their character's in the spotlight. Ultimately, that's the responsibility of the writers. I would've liked all of the cast playing a small role in solving the case. This didn't happen so the characters get little scenes that don't amount to much. Bolander and Munch banter like it's the first season but it's not the same. Kellerman and Mike Giardello have a comedic montage of brutality and eating but it's brief and ultimately pointless. All of the newer cast members are basically ignored in the movie except for Mike Giardello played by Giancarlo Esposito. His character is appropriately upset over the circumstances but imagining him being a street cop is as much as a stretch as Gee running for Mayor.

Pembleton and Bayliss end up being the focus of the movie. They take point on the investigation and they, much like that scene with Munch and Bolander bantering like the old times, share an overly dramatic scene that ties back to the series finale. The way it is written, you don't get a sense that the confession is even real, just one man rambling with a lost mind to his former partner.

The ending I did enjoy though the thought of spending eternity like it's down time at my place of work is a sobering thought.

I guess, as a fan of the show, seeing the cast members drift back into the fold was nice to see, but this was not well written and thought out. For me, the series ended with the way season 7 ended and that works well enough for me.",1521590400,,2775,4.433333333333334
