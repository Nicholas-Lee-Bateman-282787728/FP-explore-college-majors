6389750,4,B00JSB19YI,"Chaplin is more funnier on blu-ray. The Blu-ray version is more clear and more detail,this is By far the best these films ever look, I have noticed a lot of things I have never notice before and there are new footage at it to each film, this is definitely a must-have for chaplin fans. My only complaint with this set is there is a footage from The Adventurer is missing
And films like the The count, the Rink, and easy street has the weakest transfer. I hope in the future we get to see his Keystone films and Essanay  on Blu-ray.",1408233600,2,531,4.257425742574258
6389751,1,B00JSB19YI,"David Shepard was a true professional and a gentleman. While I may not have agreed with him adapting the modern slow European slant on silent film comedies I truly respected him and his efforts over the years. The silent film community is forever weaker with his passing.

I have restored this review to show that even under the face of internet criticism how he retained his professionalism and honor.  RIP Mr. Shepard.

My Shepard's restorations are amazing. Even more so considering these films are nearly 100 years old. He is one of, if not the very best at his craft. The time and effort he put into this Mutual Project I am sure was staggering. Sadly though ""the powers that be"" apparently force him to make these Chaplin Mutuals run very slooowly.

I am sure the ""each frame must be viewed like a picture on a museum wall"" crowd will disagree but the lack of speed sucks at least some of the life and energy out of what is some of the most classic comedy every produced. Admiring every frame as if it were a museum piece may be very European but that does not make it good. Regardless of the slow crowd's argument the bottom line is the running speed on this set for me reduces the ""fun quotient"" TM :)

Well at least we now have ""The Mack Sennett Collection, Vol. One"" which also features some amazing restorations but does not run at the speed of a cold snail.  I will post my review for that in the near future.

Don't get me wrong this set, on the basis of the restorations alone, is worth every penny of the cost! The ""fun quotient"" though could have been much higher if the films were allowed to run with a bit of pep.

:sigh - I know many who agree with me however my point was not to facilitate an argument, still my opinion remains unchanged; this set looks amazing but due to the speed in which the material is presented is simply not fun to watch  - and to me that is what counts most.",1407974400,10,1903,4.323033707865169
6389752,5,B00JSB19YI,"*The* definitive presentation of Chaplin's 12 Mutual comedies, scanned in high resolution and restored from the best extant prints, culled from archives around the world.  The blu rays have the most detailed picture and the most complete version of these films that we're likely ever to have, and each film has 2 excellent soundtrack options -- one orchestral score with sound effects, and one solo piano -- created by some of the best composers scoring silent films today.  The films are presented in in their entirety in two formats, both blu ray (2 discs) and DVD (3 discs), along with 2 bonus documentaries, one of them (the hour-long ""Birth of the Tramp"") making its premiere on home video.  In addition to the sturdy, hinged steelbook case, the collection contains a glossy booklet with a critical essay, notes on each film, and a number of wonderful, period photos.  In short, for Chaplin aficionados and early film buffs, this is a MUST HAVE collection that clearly supersedes the 90th anniversary edition put out by Image several years ago.",1407888000,13,1049,4.943181818181818

Great to have it on Blu-Ray, but frankly, the Image Entertainment 90th Anniversary Edition not only looks better visually (a much better restoration in my opinion) but also features music by Chaplin music expert Carl Davis.

6389756,5,B00JSB19YI,"This release of the newly restored Chaplin Mutual films is a must have for all Chaplin fansand film historians. Years ago I bought the ""Charlie Chaplin Short Comedy Classics: The Complete Restored Essanay & Mutual Collection"".It was a misnomer if ever there was one. I reviewed it at the time and pointed out more than a few of its flaws in the Mutual film department. A thing like the ending of The Rink, where the crowd chases him out of the rink. The old set ended there, instead of going on to Charlie holding on to the back of a car and the crowd tumbling down together in their fruitless effort to catch him. It and others were inexcusable mistakes/blunders that compiler David Sheppard should have known better to let pass. Apparently there was a re-issue but I wasn't forking out another bundle.
Well fast forward to this set and there is no comparison. What one notices right away when playing them is that each film is letter boxed on all four sides to get the entire original a/r in to view. If you want to see it like you are used to, just press the ""zoom"" button or equivalent on your remote one notch in,and voila...you have full screen with no degradation of film quality! The cover says from the Blackhawk Film Collection but that is misleading. These films have been restored using elements from multiple source world wide;something I have been championing for years. It now seems many are finally coming around to the concept of restoring films to get them to original release length and quality. Thank you Lord. After watching these restored marvels I can say each one has something I have never ever seen before.
The set has two BD's and three DVDs. There is a nice 27 page booklet with liner notes by Jeffrey Vance included. The entire set is in a steel box.
All in all a gem of a release by Flicker Alley which includes production/restoration help by Lobster Films,Blackhawk and Cineteca Bologna. These newly restored Chaplin Mutual's are now the current benchmarks for these films. If like me all you have been use to seeing are poor dupes made from 20s re-releases or worse,these films will blow you away. Sure there are still imperfections in the films visible but considering the sources,it is a wonder they have gotten them this good. One day the technology will be able to clean these to a mint look,just like new. Until then enjoy this set to the fullest.",1436400000,,2384,4.625
6389757,5,B00JSB19YI,"Charlie Chaplin was AMAZING! I am so glad I purchased this DVD & Blu-Ray set. I had heard about Charlie Chaplin and seen some short bits of him when I was a young kid but never knew how great he was other than hearing it from many actors when interviewed or from older family members or people. Well after taking a shot and checking this out I am a true believer of how awesome he really was. Silent shorts and movies were not much of an interest when I was kid but after checking out the Silent shorts of Laurel & Hardy later in life I found how funny they really can be with great talent which is what they were and what Chaplin certainly was. I have since purchased the Keystone & Essanay Comedies with him also and love those also. What is incredible is that my sons which are in the later teens like him as much as I do. Now something I want to tell you is that my boys and I are big Three Stooges, Honeymooners and Laurel & Hardy fans, if this helps you get an idea what we like. Never in million years did I think that we would be entertained by silent film but we have been. Charlie was incredible the way he did his physical comedy. I have watched and slowed down stuff to be totally blown away to see he is doing most everything you see. His stair routines, roller skating and running on a spinning table are awesome. His character the Tramp is without a doubt unforgettable and that is because of his brilliance. YOU CAN NOT HELP BUT LAUGH! We love how the little guy (Charlie) may get pushed but he can push right back and when it comes to a fight, he's always ready.
I do want to add that the picture quality on these films is amazing also. Very clear. These shorts are nearly 100 years old and look great. The music is a nice touch having a choice of what you want to have played also.  We now have another favorite for life. Incredible!",1427328000,4,1851,4.170391061452514

6389760,3,B00JSB19YI,"This is my personal Sync Rant.

I HATE out-of-sync sound; I think it completely ruins the watching experience.  And thats what we have here in almost every single movie.

The orchestral sound tracks may have been performed and recorded live, but that is no excuse for sound to be out of sync with the picture on a DVD.  A DVD is not live performances any more.  Good synchronization is more important for a recorded performance than it is during a live performance. It becomes intensely annoying to observe the same problems over and over upon repeated viewings.  And there is NO reason why music from an out-of-sync performance cannot be married properly to a film.  I can do it.  I've done it many times.  It is NOT HARD to do.

But this rationalization that the sound track MUST be out of sync because it was a LIVE performance is nothing but a pile of rubbish, anyway:

BLAMING THE VICTIMS

So they want to BLAME THE PERFORMERS for sloppy sync editing.  Really?

You are telling me that the sync problem is DUE to the music being recorded from a live performance??  I cannot believe the people making this assertion.

Are you JOKING?

The type of problem here is also NOT indicative of the sync problem in a live performance.  In The Floorwalker and Behind the Screen, as well as several other movies, the sound DRIFTS from being a little late or absolutely spot-on in sync with the image in the beginning of the film, to becoming CONSISTENTLY farther and farther AHEAD of the picture toward the end, until it is over a second ahead of the action(!!).

I have NEVER experienced ANY live performer playing AHEAD of a film; musicians can tend to be a tad LATE, but never early.  When did YOU last hear a live performance where the music constantly preceded the action of the picture??  Performers certainly do not become CONSISTENTLY MORE AND MORE early with their music until they are playing constantly WAY TOO EARLY for what is appearing on the screen!

According to Josh at Flicker Alley, the problem was in the editing; he said they did try to correct the sync

Obviously they did not try very hard.  There are many pauses in the sound, so the sync CAN be corrected easily (yes, EASILY) by shortening or lengthening various pauses, or shortening or lengthening certain text cards.  So I consider this sync problem to be incredibly insensitive and careless on the part of the editors...

And blaming the performers is an insult to the musicians and an intellectual insult to we as consumers of a defective product.

~ ~ ~

What I cannot figure out is why those involved in the restoration do not seem to care.

If I spent years of my time scouring the world for decent prints and restoring images sometimes frame-by-frame I would be absolutely beside myself if the entire project was ruined by careless sound editing!  This is unbelievable to me.  And the ""fix"" is so incredibly easily done...

THE PROOF:

Just for my personal edification, I put BEHIND THE SCREEN onto my Final Cut Express software.  Now Final Cut Express is a real cheap-o editing too.  Once you get to know how to use it, its childs play.

It took me a grand total of 15 minutes to COMPLETELY re-sync the movie.

Let me state that again:  IT TOOK ME 15 MINUTES TO RE-SYNC THE FILM!!!

SO:

MY PROPOSAL:

I invite David Shepard, Serge Bromberg, or anyone from any stage of the next film restorations who have anything to do with either the actual marrying of sound-to-film, or who have anything to do with the quality assurance before distribution of such products via Flicker Alley or Kino or whatever, to come to my house and watch me while I re-sync any of these films.  If you don't believe me that I can do it.

Now I know Mr. Shepard is currently working on new versions of Chaplins Essanay films.  OK, so give me the software you want me to use for editing picture and sound, show me how to use it, AND I WILL DO THE WORK FOR YOU.  And I will CHARGE you NOTHING.  I will DO IT FOR FREE because I love silent comedy!

If your professionals cant or won't do the work to justify their salary, then give it to an amateur to get the job done.  It IS NOT HARD.

Really.

I can do it.

And, actually, so could you.",1414454400,9,4189,4.482119205298013

6389763,5,B00JSB19YI,"If you already own the 90th Anniversary DVD set and are wondering if it is worth the upgrade to this edition, IT IS! Each film has upgrades varying from modest to major. See individual titles below for details.
I wanted to clear up a few things some reviewers have issues with. THIS IS MORE THAN A 5 STAR SET!
a) The Blu-rays are NOT widow-boxed.
b) The sound effects & music are performed LIVE as they would have been in a hollywood theater in 1913, so it would not be perfectly synced.
c) Since no original title cards survive today, nobody knows what they would have looked like. So plain blank cards with white letters were created.  All previous DVD releases used title-cards from various re-issues.
d) The film speed feels correct. These are not knock-about Keystone comedies, they are more thoughtful Mutual comedies that rely on Chaplin's subtle expressions to convey the humor.

I may sound like I am repeating myself when I talk about all of the improvements over the previous 90th Anniversary DVD, but much searching through archives has turned up superior film masters for this new HD release.
We are getting very close to seeing these as Chaplin meant us to see them back in 1916 & 1917.

Blu-ray disc 1
1) THE FLOORWALKER (29:19) The improvement I could see here is the sharper image on the new 2013 HD transfer for this Blu-ray release.  I would love to do a split-screen running the two releases side by side, but I can't do that right now.
- Chaplin's first short for Mutual is pure slapstick fun in a department store. Villainous store manager tries to frame innocent Charlie for the money that he stole.
2) THE FIREMAN (26:24) Right from the start NEWLY FOUND FOOTAGE can be seen in this new release. First an introductory card is restored informing us that the ""Captain Calls The Fire Drill"". We then see a shot of Eric Campbell thinking, looking at the fire bell, then getting an idea.  This is all missing from the previous DVD release, that version fades up as Eric is walking over to the fire bell.  Later another descriptive card is restored informing us that the sleeping Chaplin is the driver, we don't know this in the previous DVD.  I could go on & on, but you get the idea: more footage & cards have been restored. The image on the new Blu-ray is much sharper.
- Another knock-down hilarious slapstick comedy reminiscent of the Keystone & Essanay films.
3) THE VAGABOND (26:37) Big improvement here!  The older DVDs came from a sound re-issue print that cropped off the left side of the picture to add the soundtrack. This new transfer comes from a newly discovered full aperture silent print.  In addition to more picture on the left side, we have a sharper image on this new 2013 HD transfer for Blu-ray.
- Chaplin's delves into more drama with this film, not to say there aren't any laughs.
4) ONE AM  (27:22)  Fully restored from a pristine sharp 35mm print, includes the 7 minutes found in 2006.  This version looks like it was filmed yesterday!
- This is almost a 1-man show displaying Charlie's performance perfection.  His drunken character does battle with the objects in his house in an attempt to go to bed.  This is one of my all-time Chaplin favorites.
5) THE COUNT (25:11) Big improvement here!  The older DVDs came from a sound re-issue print that cropped off the left side of the picture to add the soundtrack. This new transfer comes from a newly discovered full aperture silent print.  In addition to more picture on the left side, we have a sharper image on this new 2013 HD transfer for Blu-ray. Some people may like the darker contrast of the sound print, but I find the slightly lighter silent print fully acceptable. There is also a few more frames of NEW FOOTAGE just after the title cards that got lost in the sound print (used for the old DVDs) when a fade-up was created.
6) THE PAWNSHOP (26:41) In comparing the two releases, right from the start you think you are watching different films. NEWLY FOUND FOOTAGE with the pawnshop owner waving his arms & pacing around, looking at his pocket watch and then repeating his movements is all missing from the old DVD.  When we get to the first matching shot of the girl in the kitchen, each release seems to come from two different camera negatives. The old DVD cuts off the top of her head as well as heavily cutting off the right side of the picture and a little from the bottom.  This new HD transfer has plenty of head room & much more image on the right side, but there is some image missing from the left side,  Overall the new release framing is much more appealing, it must be the ""A"" Negative.  After this shot of the girl in the kitchen, the framing seems to be similar.  Just as Chaplin is about to enter a new title card instructs us that Chaplin is late, this appears later in the old DVD as a line of dialogue.  Studio records indicate this is the correct location for the card.  Again, the image is much sharper in this new HD transfer.
7) BEHIND THE SCREEN (25:23) A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT over the old 90th Anniversary DVD. The first thing I notice in the very opening shot is more picture on all four sides of the picture, the old DVD is heavily cropped.  On the far left there are two ladies talking, the lady to the left is unseen on the old DVD. It is as if the image first got heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack, then the top & bottom got heavily cropped to restore the aspect ratio back to 4:33-1. To top it off the old DVD lost some image on the right side in the process.  The cropping varies from severe to minor on the old DVD, depending of what surviving source was used.  This new HD transefr is more consistant on showing the entire image.  The old DVD is also soft where this new HD transfer is sharp.
- Behind the scenes at a movie studio (I love to see these early silent studio workings) Chaplin improves upon his previous Keystone offerings ""A FILM JOHNNY"", and ""THE PROPERTY MAN"". His timing is honed to perfection here to make one enjoyable comedy. Chaplin is almost burlesquing his days at the Keystone Studios.
8) THE RINK (25:47) Another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Some may have issues with the newer print being lighter than the sound re-issue print.  Maybe the black levels could have been brought down a little on this new transfer, but it is not over-exposed.  If you compare the loss of details in the white objects, you will find this happens on both versions, this problem seems to have occurred early in this films history, maybe some time in the 1930's.  Until a camera original negative or an earlier nitrate print is found, this is the best we will have.  To include any footage from the previous release because of better contrast would mean giving up image on the left side.  So it is a little bit of a trade off here, a fuller frame but lighter print with more image on the left side or a heavily cropped print with better contrast.  It is a matter of the source print used.

Blu-ray disc 2
9) EASY STREET (26:58) Yet another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Some may have issues with the newer print being lighter than the sound re-issue print. But if you look at the interior shots of the Police Station you will see that the shadows are too dark and details are lost.  The first inter-title has also been changed, based on Keystone copyright filing records.
- Charlie joins the police force of Easy Street to restore law & order to this disruptive part of town.  How times have changed, gas street lamps are still in use in this short.
10) THE CURE (26:26) The big improvements keep coming.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Needless to say, the image is sharper with more details in the dark areas.
- A good sequel to ""ONE AM"" as Charlie enters a sobriety spa with a spring holding magical curing powers. He packs his wardrobe full of liquor to help him through the treatment.  You'll howell as Chaplin does battle with a revolving door.
11) THE IMMIGRANT (24:58) Another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Take note of the opening scene with the ship in the water. The old DVD has the ship going off screen on the left, now with this new full frame transfer the ship is perfectly centered on the screen with plenty of ocean on both sides..  The new HD transfer is over all sharper.
- A more thoughtful comedy as Charlie and Edna Purviance along with others are immigrating to the U.S. from Europe.  The first half deals with their nauseating boat trip across the ocean, the second half deals with Charlie & Edna trying to afford a meal at a restaurant.
**Note: Out-takes & bloopers from ""The Immigrant"" with changes in the cast can be seen in the included documentary ""The Birth Of The Tramp"".
12) THE ADVENTURER (26:55) So much more detail has been restored to the picture it makes the old release look like a Madacey DVD (which Image has now merged with).  In the opening manhunt sequence, the details in the foliage and shrubbery is amazing, the old DVD was just murky shades of grey.  Now you can see every twig & branch! The old DVD also had some left-side cropped insert scenes from a sound re-issue print.
- A comedy more in the style of the Essanays. While on the run from the law, Charlie manages to rescue a drowning woman. In gratitude Charlie is brought back to their mansion where he passes himself off as a rich adventurer.

Bonus Material:
THE BIRTH OF THE TRAMP (2013) 63 minutes - Historian & film preservationist Serge Bromberg & Eric Lang co-produced this documentation of Chaplin's early period prior to becoming his own producer. Illustrated with newsreel clips & highlight moments from his films.
CHAPLN'S GOLIATH (1996) 54 minutes - A Scottish TV production celebrating who they feel is the first big Scottish movie star, Eric Campbell, known around the world as Chaplin's best villain.

SADLY MISSING is the 1975 film ""The Gentleman Tramp"" that featured the Chaplin home movies and some of the last film appearances of Sir Charles Chaplin at his Switzerland home.  It is narrated by Walter Matthau with readings from Chaplin's ""My Autobiography"" by Laurence Olivier. You may find yourself keeping this separate disc from the old DVD set.

David Shepard is now busy working on a new restoration of the Chaplin Essanay Comedies!

6389764,3,B00JSB19YI,"I was hoping for a complete restoration of the films from beginning to end. I was hoping that the films would be as close to the way they were ORIGINALLY released in 1916-17. My only issue so far is with the opening titles. I highly doubt that the ORIGINAL titles had ""This restoration was made possible thanks to the generous support of..."" AFTER the film's title. I am all about giving credit where credit is due, but maybe the credit to the George Lucas family and others should have come before the film's title or immediately after the film itself.

*EDIT (September 17, 2014): I just dropped the set down to 3 stars. Why? I finally listened to the orchestral scores. Yes, they are out of sync, I just watched ""The Rink"" and ""The Immigrant"" and can hear the laughter and applause from a live audience. It really distracts from the films and gives them more of a feel of a sitcom than a silent film. It makes me sad, I wanted to give this 5 stars. I'm almost afraid to watch any more of this set, it might get even more stars taken away. Very disappointing.

If this set were restored films of Ben Turpin or Larry Semon, I would accept the faults. This is CHARLES CHAPLIN, one of the most, if not THE MOST, important filmmakers of all time. One of the most recognizable and beloved comedians of the 20th century. He deserves much better than this.",1410307200,7,1351,4.421686746987952
6389765,5,B00JSB19YI,This is the best looking Chaplin Mutual set ever! Most complete and the most beautifully remastered and restored collection. I hope one day they will do they same with Laurel & Hardys silents. My only quibble and I would like other reviewers to comment if they have had the same experience....I have noticed that some of the sound effects on both blu ray and DVD discs are out of sync on some of the films??,1410048000,2,407,4.44
6389766,5,B00JSB19YI,"Wow!!!!  I first saw some of these films back in the 70s when a pizza chain would keep loops of silent films running to entertain the customers.  1 AM was a mess.  Very funny but irritating.  Jumpy, faded, scenes were chopped up, all sorts of film problems.  And only about 10 minutes long!  I wanted to see the original!  I bought these a couple of times on DVD, each set better but still 1 AM never seemed like a complete real film.  It is now!

Yeah, maybe the image is not as good as a new film where you can see every pore on someone's face.  But you can get lost in it now like the movie it really is instead of wishing it were better.

Sorry if I've focused on 1AM but that's really the one that I always wanted to see.  And that's the only one I've had time to watch.  Bet the rest of the films look just as nice.  Normally I don't like to rebuy a film each time a new edition comes out but this one is worth it!  You'll never watch the old versions again.",1409875200,,964,3.973821989528796
6389767,3,B00JSB19YI,"Good Box Set, but some issues that keep me from loving it.
The Good points:
Print Quality: The prints look fantastic! Not perfect, but the best we have ever seen. As one who purchased Blackhawk prints in David Shepard's wonderful restoration of the films back in the 1970's I can honestly say the new Flicker Alley release is as near pristine as we will ever see.
Speed Correction: While these films really do not have a set speed. The industry would later adopt a standard speed when motor driver projectors, and sound would become the norm. I would judge that they project at about 20fps, and it appears that's about the speed used. They do not run slow as another reviewer stated. This is my opinion of course.
Musical Scores: OMG. Simply the BEST scores on any set. They even incorporate some of the wonderful Winston Sharples scores from the Van Buren re-issues of the 1930's, and you can choose from two scores available on every short.

The Bad points:
""Window Box"" Every short is presented in a ""Window Box"" format which I do not care for. I'm not sure why they choose this, it could be because they used original silent 35mm prints that have a larger aperture than sound prints. I project them on a 12 foot screen and they looked fine, but on a standard TV screen the image is very small.
Opening Credits: The shorts do not have original opening credits. The former Image Entertainment sets as well as the Blackhawk restored versions have opening credits that may or may not be original to the films, but look original. This set has credits in a modern type set, and look pretty bad. Considering they did so well with re-creating the inter titles, why not do the same for the opening titles?

I'm really trying to be fair with this set, but I won't be selling my Image Entertainment version.",1409270400,12,1800,4.569659442724459
6389768,2,B00JSB19YI,"The additional resolution of the bluray makes this the set to have, but buyers should be warned the people performing the ""restoration"" failed to understand basic things such as clipping of the highlights.  Every other Chaplin Mutual transfer I've seen does not suffer this, and as someone who has personally ran 35mm prints of the Mutuals, I can attest the originals are NOT overexposed...but that IS the case here on these blurays.  It's clearly video clipping as well.

I was also annoyed at the new captions.  There was no reason to put their ""Mutual Chaplin"" logo in the corner AND the title of the short we are watching on each card.  It was distracting every single time.  No doubt someone mastering this thought the ""branding"" would somehow be a good idea.  It's not.

Even more disappointing is the fact that there ARE sources out there that do not have all of the constant jump cuts and MASSIVE negative scratches on them, as do these.  The clear lines running through the picture are rampant in this ""restoration"".  Now sure back in the day the camera negative was used to make every single print and the Mutuals were before the time that Chaplin ordered his own personal dupe before the release prints started being struck, but again there ARE better surviving elements than the ones chosen here.  It is for this reason I'm extremely disappointed they called this a ""restoration"".  Its not.

I'm giving this 2 stars only because of the resolution.",1408838400,12,1459,4.788

The Mutuals mark the maturing of Chaplin's Little Tramp and his genius as a filmmaker, in which he developed his style of combining comedy with pathos, something he was to do for the rest of his career. Chaplin dug deep into his repository of personal experience for subject matter - growing up in poverty, performing in the London music halls, immigrating to America, possessing an innate romantic spirit - all of it provided the inspiration he needed to build the foundation for story and characterization. The result was a series of brilliant, cinematic jewels that remain unrivaled in the history of film comedy.

The clarity and amount of detail we can now see in these nearly-a-century-old films is truly outstanding, eclipsing Image's 90th Anniversary DVD set. There's even bits and pieces of footage that's missing from that edition now fully intact. The shorts also contain brand new intertitles made from samples of the original Mutual titles. Nitrate film sources include Blackhawk Films, Library of Congress, MoMA, and Lobster Films, among others. Musical accompaniment comes with the option of full orchestra or piano, newly recorded by such well-known artists as Neil Brand, Timothy Brock, Carl Davis, Robert Israel, the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, and Donald Sosin. There's a detailed booklet with an essay and liner notes on each film by Chaplin author, Jeffrey Vance. Also included are two documentaries, THE BIRTH OF THE TRAMP and CHAPLIN'S GOLIATH - a tribute to screen villain, Eric Campbell.

The best way to describe Flicker Alley's CHAPLIN MUTUAL COMEDIES is to say that if I were stuck on a desert island, this set would be part of the survival kit. My highest recommendation.",1408752000,9,2208,5.196629213483146

Kudos to all who lovingly transferred them to Blu-ray.  The packaging is very attractive and it contains a very informative booklet that discusses Chaplin's Mutual years.

I have not watched all 12 movies yet, but the ones I have seen are in good shape.  Be aware that these will not look nearly as good as other restorations, such as ""City Lights"" or Keaton's ""The General"".  The source material is just too beat up.  The image, however, is much sharper and clearer than any I have seen.  They have done a good job of recovering fading, but the image varies from looking full to being slightly washed out.  There are some missing frames and the action jumps, but that's a problem with the source that can't be overcome.

Speaking of source material, some of the films have been reconstructed from several sources. The restorers have done a great job of balancing the source so most of the time it is not noticeable when it changes from one source to the other.  They also did a great job of stabilizing the image.  Chaplin used static cameras almost exclusively.  The early cameras didn't have pin registration and often the images of old films would wobble.  They have removed the wobble so that backgrounds stay rock steady.

Another reviewer mentioned the speed being slow, but so far the speed looks correct.  It does not have the frantic look of films projected too fast, yet scenes that I feel were probably undercranked for effect are not too slow.

Finally, there's the performances. The quality of the image makes it that much easier to appreciate the work of Chaplin and his supporting cast.  These films are just fun to watch and you can watch Chaplin refine his craft over the course of 18 months and 12 movies.",1408492800,5,1889,4.63855421686747
6389771,5,B00JSB19YI,"Tremendous value for money,  5 discs... 2 Blu ray and the entire program on 3 DVDs as well.  The legendary Mutual films, plus two documentaries.  Chaplin invented the Tramp at Keystone, began to leave the scoundrel Tramp at Essanay , and his year at Mutual really took his film making and character to the top of the world.  The films are not given the KINO treatment (which means NO treatment).... these are absolutely the best elements from around the world, multiple scores to choose from and other than the silly company logo on each of the newly created Inter Titles..... a revelation.  OH, on the Amazon.com page there is  a short clip... at the end it gives the email address of the company producing them. .... and selling them for 20 bucks less than Amazon.com.  I bought direct and they arrived on the 19th.... and I watched them straight through.  These films contain some of the most iconic images of the legendary Chaplin .... roller skating , or balancing on the boat in the immigrants, and many more. To think these were created 98 years ago.... staggering to have them and in such good shape.  This is about half the price the DVD set alone was that came out several years back..... and at 39 bucks about the price of a single Criterion or KINO BR disc.
HIGHLY Recommended.",1408406400,8,1289,4.593886462882096
6389772,5,B00JSB19YI,"(Note: While the DVDs look good too, the comments here are for the Blu-ray discs.)
This is probably the best these films have looked since a week after they were first released. They don't look brand-new like a current film, but on their initial releases these films were run so many times that they probably looked far worse than this to anyone except the opening night audiences.

Aside from the image quality there's, of course, the films themselves... and they're as funny and awesome as can be.  The work seems effortless, and spontaneous, though they weren't (see: Unknown Chaplin).  Chaplin really looks like he's having a great time.

I highly recommend these to fans and suggest even people unfamiliar with Chaplin give them a try.",1408320000,,740,4.896
8653716,2,B00JSB19YI,"I so wanted to love this set.  The Chaplin Mutuals are among the funniest and most important short comedies ever made, and they were the foundation for so many films of the '20s, '30s and '40s.  Unfortunately, they look worse in these ""restorations"" than in any prior legitimate video release.  They have been sharpened to the point that a snowstorm of film grain dances around every shot.  Worse, these films are no longer black and white, they are light gray and white.  The opening shots of ""The Count"" and ""Easy Street"" and many other sections look like bad xerox copies.  The films are very steady, yes, but they are also mastered here at a speed that's much too slow.  Since when do two-reel comedies run for 27 minutes and change?  The orchestral scores are often overdone, overwhelming the visual and seeming to forget that these films were intended to be rowdy comedies and not revered museum pieces. I much prefer Grapevine Video's transfers of the Van Beuren reissues from the early '30s; the grayscale is much better, the films run at a faster speed and the lively hot jazz scores are much more appropriate.  The Flicker Alley edition was, I am so sad to say, a profound disappointment.",1524528000,,1198,4.721153846153846

The quality on these discs are amazing for films that were made a 100 years ago. 28 page booklet with a description and history of 12 films. Choice of an orchestra musical score or a piano version. I like the piano version myself. Bonus material includes a 63 minute documentary The Birth of the Tramp, and a documentary of Chaplin's Goliath, the story of Eric Campbell. Classic scene of both of them fighting while on roller skates in ""The Rink""",1457568000,,520,4.542553191489362
