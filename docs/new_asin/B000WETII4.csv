8223066,3,B000WETII4,"The instruction is ok, the looks are ok although kind of over the top not really for everyday looks....some of the models start offa mess and end up looking like hoochies.  The videos appearance will make you wonder why you paid $40 for what looks like it was filmed in a bathroom with a handheld camera.....PASS!",1271980800,9,313,4.589285714285714

8223068,5,B000WETII4,Dennesa Myricks deserves a reward for such a job well done on this step by step instructional video. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone fellow Makeup Artist or everyday woman that needs and wants to look good...,1214697600,2,214,4.657894736842105
8223069,5,B000WETII4,"Applying makeup has never come easy to me, I've always known what I want to look like but never had the skills to achieve that look. Before this, I'd tried the Alexis Vogel cosmetic system, a very expensive mistake as the needs and coloring of my deep skin tone were not addressed. Great cosmetics & excellent video, just not for me.

This video was just what I'd been looking for. The colors and techniques were applicable to the skin tones of women of color. As the title implies, Danessa walked thru basic steps and tips, including the tools that one needs, then she also built upon each look to turn up the ""wow factor"". The skills I've learned have taken me from a basic look for my conservative office, to a nice evening look, to a dramatic look to wear at a club or social function. It didn't happen over night for me. I watched the video a few times completely thru, then started it and practiced along with her. Now I can apply without using the DVD.

On a lark, I asked a friend and a co-worker (both non-blacks) to try out the video because I wanted to know if it would work for them. Both were able to do multiple looks with similar cosmetic products they already own. Big thumbs up from both.

Very good buy.",1213228800,12,1221,4.3464912280701755
8223070,5,B000WETII4,"I love the step-by-step video because you are able to learn in the comfort of your own home and not be distracted in a classroom setting.  It's a great intro to any one wants to learn how to apply make-up and for make-up artist who are just getting started in the industry.  Danessa made it easy for you to learn and use these steps in your practice.  I will be getting all of the volumes and would recommend this to all of my friends.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-by-Step-Make-up-Basics-Beyond-Vol-1/dp/B000WETII4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step-by-Step Make up Basics & Beyond Vol 1</a>",1208736000,2,639,5.776595744680851
8223071,5,B000WETII4,"This Step by Step DVD is so educational and helpful. It teaches you the major dynamics about makeup application that a makeup counter in a dept store does not teach you. It's not only for aspiring makeup artists, but also for those who want to learn how to apply their own makeup properly. It definitely goes above and beyond recommendation!",1191974400,9,341,4.7
