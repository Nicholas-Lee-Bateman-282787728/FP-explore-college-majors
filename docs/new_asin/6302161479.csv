433018,4,6302161479,"Not technically slick by today's standards, this movie is buoyed by a superb soundtrack.  The nostalgia value alone is worth two stars.  It's fun to watch Martin Mull in his first role and who wouldn't love listening to Eileen Brennan as ""Mother"" spinning the best on wax through the speakers of your dad's Chevy Monza?  Good movie also for those who had a disdain for the disco fad - and still do.",1038873600,3,398,4.5
433019,3,6302161479,"As most folks know, FM served as the inspiration for the later, greater television series WKRP IN CINCINNATI. Almost all the characters here have a counterpoint on the show and even look alike in some cases (the resemblance between Michael Brandon and Gary Sandy, for instance, is remarkable). On its own FM is a serviceable little vehicle to showcase some truly wonderful pop-rock tunes from the mid to late 1970's, including Steely Dan's glorious title song. The plot is perfunctory at best: a maverick radio DJ and programming director (Brandon) refuses to give into corporate pressure to air jingoistic ads for the military on his station; by the end of the picture he and his co-horts have barricaded themselves in the station to protest and incite a minor riot.
The plot is just an excuse for some very good concert footage featuring Jimmy Buffet and, especially, Linda Ronstadt. Tom Petty and Reo Speedwagon also make appearances. There are also some good character vignettes here too. While Brandon is rather non-descript in his leading role, Martin Mull stands out as Eric Swann, a flashy, hip, slick tune-spinner who shows some surprising vulnerability, and Eileen Brennan has a nice moment too as a burnt out DJ pondering her future, as Dan Fogelberg's lovely song ""There's a Place in the World for a Gambler"" swells behind her.
I like the look of the movie very much. Famed cinematographer John A. Alonzo, making his directorial debut, gives the movie the nice, sunny, green-and-caramel hues of the late 1970's without ever making it seem dated. But it is the soundtrack that makes this one worthwhile.
The movie adds up to little more than light and breezy amusement and is strictly for the nostalgically inclined.",1022630400,8,1727,4.97923875432526
433020,4,6302161479,"As a fan of Linda Ronstadt, I consider this film to be a ""must have"" simply for the extensive concert footage of her music from the 1970's.

433021,5,6302161479,"This is a classic film that possibly inspired TV's WKRP. Unlike some films, it is chock full of notable music and artists. The atmosphere is a throwback to simplier times. I first saw this film back in 1988 when i was  in high school. I thought it was pretty good. Too bad I wasn't old enough  to go that Jimmy Buffett concert. The one thing I love about this movie is  that it is put into mini storylines. That is what makes this movie  interesting and unique. Martin Mull is likeable as Eric Swan, the station's  self-centered DJ. If you watch closely, you'll notice some of the smiliar  traits that the DJs have with the WKRP DJs (Jeff Dugan=Andy Travis, Eric  Swan=Dr. Johnny Fever, Prince of Darkness=Venus Flytrap, Bobby  Douglas=Bailey Quarters). Give this one a try. It will really take you  back.",951782400,23,805,4.612676056338028

433065,2,6302161479,"This film is a waste of celluloid, a waste of time and a waste of effort by anyone connected with or viewing it.  To be avoided.",1509062400,,128,3.923076923076923
433066,3,6302161479,"I loved this film when I first saw it back in 1978. Of course I was just 16 years old, and there -may- have been some herbal enhancement that contributed to my enjoyment of the film ... but that was then and this is now, and I'm here to tell you that FM has not aged well.

There are no realistic characters in this film, they're -all- caricatures. There's the hip black dude who covers the night shift, the self centered romeo with dreams of bigger gigs, the tortured soul (""Mother"") who has burned out, the ridiculously square pot smoking Army recruiters who want to advertise on QSKY, the corporate stooge sent to the station to cash in on their ratings, the rebellious and rdiculously cool station owner, assorted groupies, and the station's Drone-like fans.

There's lots of cringe-inducing dialogue, especially from Eileen Brennan's ""Mother"", and the last quarter of the film takes a really silly turn when the DJs and staff take over the radio station office in protest of the aforementioned Army recruitment ads. The whole vibe is like a hippie version of a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney ""Hey Kids Lets Put On A Show"" but this time it's ""Rock and Roll is More Powerful than The Corporate Man, and Power to The People, and Fight The Power, Yeah Man!""

The last scenes are supposed to take place outside the station offices but it's painfully obvious that it was filmed on a soundstage. The lighting is awful! It all ends on a really silly note.

BUT ... The music is great, and the concert performances from Linda Ronstadt and Jimmy Buffet are entertaining. I understand that some of the original music had to be cut out of this release because of copywrite issues but I don't remember what songs they were and I couldn't tell from watching the film today. Other reviewers will be more helpful with those details.

Recommended (just barely) for nostalgia's sake ... If you can get a cheap copy.",1508025600,,1900,4.642857142857143
433067,5,6302161479,"Too bad that today's radio stations don't share this feeling about their deejays as these guys did. When was the last time you could call the DJ at your favorite station and speak to him? No? Why not? Because today's radio no longer has live DJs. It's all animated...

Sorry...got carried away. Anyway, ""FM"" is about 50% responsible of what got me into being a DJ (Casey Kasem being the other 50%). Jocks at LA's QSKY (""Where we never come down to Earth!""), 7 come 11 FM! YEAH! Radio at its finest! Back when the DJs had complete control over what they played instead of computers and automation, and you could listen to your favorite songs with little to no commercial credola. Dugan, Swan, Mother, Laura Coe, and The Prince of Darkness (played by everyone's favorite black sheriff, Cleavon Little) give the sales creeps a run for their money when they take over the station after threatening to leave. Music guests Jimmy Buffett and the lovely and talented Linda Ronstadt star in this wonderful 1970s romp through the airwaves at fictional QSKY. And check out the HOTT action when Delores Deluxe gives Swan a...ummm....err.....(DAMN!!! WHY didn't that happen to me at MY radio station?)

433090,3,6302161479,"My Three (3) Stars is for the quality of this Release, not the Movie itself, which is a fave-rave of mine.

I just picked this up and, honestly, when compared, it seems the same as a Boot I bought a while back.  The Picture is Very Soft with mushy detail, the Blacks are also very Mushy, and the Colors are pretty faded and mushy too.  Basically, it's Mushy in every category I can think of.

On the other hand, the Audio on my Boot is MUCH better, as opposed to this ""Mushy"" version.

I have an old LD of this that is a bit better (likely because its 540) and with great sound (and likely where my Boot Audio was Ripped from), but I've never seen the Official old DVD, so I have no idea if this new version is the same or better than the new version.  I doubt it.

433110,5,6302161479,"I saw this movie in the theater (twice) when it came out in May 1978, when I was in junior high school. What the movie might have lacked in a story line was compensated by a killer soundtrack, incredible music in this film. Its great to see that it was re-released on DVD again in 2016. I was looking around for the DVD a few years back and didn't see one priced for under $100 ! No way was I going to pay that much for it. I settled for a VHS tape in mint condition for $12, which I transferred to digital with Final Cut Pro.

One thing I noticed in watching the VHS version of this film is that there are a few scenes that were cut from the original theatrical version:

1. The Linda Ronstadt concert footage  in the theatrical version, theres a point in the concert where Ronstadt talks to the audience and gives a plug to Karla Bonoffs new LP release (Bonoffs 1977 debut LP), which Ronstadt participated in. Its just a few seconds where shes talking to the audience, but for some reason, it was cut out from the VHS tape version, and presumably from the DVD versions as well. Also the part where she introduces the band members was also cut (I think).

2. Various scenes in the movie were edited.with Martin Mull and his female visitor, and other scenes as wellIm guessing that it was to curtail what little nudity might have appeared in the film.

Martin Mull, Michael Brandon, Alex Karras, Eileen Brennen, Cleavon Little, Cassie Yateswhat an interesting cast of characters! Cameos by Tom Petty and REO Speedwagon....great concert footage of Linda Ronstadt and Jimmy Buffett, and that incredible soundtrackwhat more can one ask for?!

The movie means a lot to people that have been in radio broadcasting. It reminds us of the good ole days of real radio personalities, playing real records. Caring about the listeners! It is a little more heavy than the wkrp TV show...but if you enjoyed wkrp, you'll enjoy this movie. I assume, copywrites to the music kept this movie from DVD for years. I have the vhs , now the DVD. If you love radio, the 70s and the music of that era, this is for you. Plus live performances by Linda Ronstadt and jimmy buffet.  Enjoy",1477008000,2,635,4.162601626016261

433115,5,6302161479,"Finally!!! Re-released on DVD! I have been waiting for this movie to be released again on DVD for ages. It was one of my favorite flicks as a teenager and the soundtrack remains one of my faves. There are some great artists who make appearances here...Jimmy Buffett, Linda Ronstadt and Tom Petty. The story revolves around a small LA radio station and its struggle to play the music they want to play. This topic was a big deal in the 70's when FM radio was in flux and in danger of becoming what it is today..an embarrassment.

Still, FM is a great comedy nonetheless. Enjoy Michael Brandon, Martin Mull, Alex Karras, Cassie Yates, Cleavon Little and Eileen Brennan deliver one liners and play off each other in this movie that was the inspiration for the tv show, WKRP IN CINCINNATI.

This is not a movie that garnered much attention when it was originally released, but it remains a cult favorite amongst fans. Enjoy it all over again or for the first time, Consider it a history listen with laughs.",1472428800,3,1002,4.592178770949721

433160,5,6302161479,"Everyone knows the FM soundtrack is a deeply cool Rock and Roll experience. This movie puts into context the music and the times when R&R was 'perfected'. We really haven't seen a better R&R period since this time. And we still listen to the music of this time period as though it happened last night.

I was living in a submarine (really) during this time period and music was one of THE only real escapes from the drudgery and isolation that months and months underwater without outside stimulation brings. We didn't have DVD or VHS, but we did have the soundtrack on reel to reel thanks to a dedicated group of audiophiles on board. And FM provided great listening. It was as good as the very best local radio station (WWWZ Summerville S.C)

I saw this (FM) when it was released and simply loved it. Don't get me wrong, it's 'just' music. But music ""IS"" emotion. And this 'movie' delivers truly great music from the best of the era in a format that brings out the 'emotion' that R&R was famous for during the period when it was clear that R&R was on the back side of the curve.

If you love the live 'concert' experience but really don't care for the crowds and the hassle of 'going' put this on your home entertainment system and crank it up, grab your favorite refreshing adult beverage and your favorite people and enjoy a really fun evening of people who themselves love music simply for the art of it.",1390435200,,1409,4.474708171206226

433179,3,6302161479,"Disclosure: I radio on-air guy from 1980 to 1990 and later with talk shows (some in major markets). So my view of a movie like this is much MUCH different from the average viewer.

For me, the best thing about the film was seeing all the equipment, the gear, the mics, the turntables and the cart racks and players. Did you know that those turntables had massive motors that got the record up to speed within one-quarter of a rotation? You would cue the record up to right before the song started and hold it in place (there was felt underneath to allow it to slip) and then let it go to launch the song!

So much for the good old days.  In the real world, sales called the shots, period. Also, jocks usually had a playlist or schedule of what songs to play. These were often based on the song popularity in a rating magazine such as Billboard. You did NOT get to play what you wanted! (You may have made it seem like you did.)

I did enjoy seeing all the 70's hair on all the extras...including the crummy little mustaches on some of the guys and the sweep do's on the ladies. There were even a few bell-bottoms.

The main character was a ""program director,"" the guy responsible for the overall sound of the station.  In the biz, the definition of a PD was a guy who ""always walked fast and looked worried.""  He was caught between following the orders of management and appeasing the air staff.  He seldom made enough money to own a Porsche like the guy in the movie. The folks with the nice cars were always in sales. The movie did accurately portray the animosity between the sales team and the air staff. But most often, the sales department called the shots.

Sexy women seldom got into my studio. It just doesn't happen. Once, a women dressed as a French Maid got past everyone, but she wasn't after me, she was announcing a new brand of French style yoghurt.  I never worked anywhere where alcohol was on display and (believe it or not) drugs were used.  And what was with the longish hair on the Army guys?  Was the part not paying enough for them to get an accurate GI haircut?

I was really sad to see a massive demonstration scene with cops, vehicles being overturned, etc., all over a radio station and only ten years after the massive anti-war demonstrations in 1968 and only a few years after the killings at Kent State.  So, when the main character realized that the cop he was tussling with almost got killed and he stopped the insanity, I thought that was pretty good plot writing.  But mostly the characters were stereotypes with only glimmers of real people. ""Mother"" wanting to quit but coming back was VERY real.

Sadly, all those days are gone with few local jocks and lots of ""tracking"" to make it sound like the person is in town.  Radio shot itself in the foot when it decided that ""20 songs in a row"" was a good idea. It just trained people to use iPods.

So, for accurate gear and a few pangs of nostalgia, I give it 3 stars.  Internet radio, anyone?",1335484800,2,2977,4.38

433182,4,6302161479,"This feels like a period piece, set in 1977-1978, except it was filmed at the time, so everything is perfect.  It is as if they knew at the time that this was final chapter in a period of artistic freedom in FM radio before corporations turned it into a purely commercial affair, with pre-programmed playlists.  Ironically, most of the musical material became commercially successful staples of classic rock radio, but at the time Top 40/Pop was disco 24/7.  Rock was played mostly on FM stations and rock radio was still coming out of the underground.  Stations like KSAN in the bay area allowed DJ's to program their own shows.  The could play an album side, or play deeper or longer tracks.  They could talk to the audience as long as they wanted, so long as they kept ratings relatively high.  It was still commercial, but commercials were played less often, as most commercials gravitated toward Top 40 and AM radio.

The acting is not the best, but everyone plays it cool and as natural as possible.  You can almost smell the herbal cigarettes.  The clothes are great, too.  The casual vibe will make you want to go back in time to this simpler era.  Plus, the live performances by Linda Rondstadt and Jimmy Buffet fuse wonderfully into the plot, as shows the characters themselves attend.  The effect is seamless and makes you feel like you are real rock music insider, going back stage, meeting the performers as the sit around the station, or sit alongside them as they autograph their albums at Tower Records.

For any classic rock music fan, this movie is IT.  Must have.  That said, I would refuse to pay these exorbitant prices for the DVD.  Get on VHS or wait for it play on cable TV, which does from time to time.  It WAS released a while back on DVD, so I'm not sure I understand why it is not still in circulation.  I will continue to keep it on my wish list until it gets re-released, hopefully on Blu-Ray someday soon.  Great flick.",1303171200,2,1951,4.551724137931035

433201,4,6302161479,"Though it was not necessarily a big box office hit when it was released in the spring of 1978, FM does remain something of a cult favorite--not only for the wall-to-wall soundtrack of what were then Top 40 favorites and are now classic rock radio staples, but also because at least some of what it shows has come to pass with respect to the radio business.

The film chronicles the fictitious L.A. radio station QSKY, whose program director (Michael Brandon), along with a staff of wild and crazy DJs (Martin Mull; Cassie Yates; Alex Karras; Eileen Brennan) has made the station the #1 radio station in the nation's second biggest media market by playing the best music with as little commercial interruptions as is humanly possible.  But all this success has got ""the boys upstairs"" thinking that the station could make even more money by cutting down the music and ratcheting up the corporate way of thinking; in this case, it would be placing ads for the U.S. Army in-between bursts of Steely Dan, Boz Scaggs, and more.  The pressure finally gets to Brandon and his merry crew, until they instigate a strike that nearly erupts into a riot.

Though it is hardly the stuff that cinematic masterpieces are made of, and its similarity to the later CBS-TV show ""WKRP In Cincinnati"" is rather coincidental (the TV show's plot being shot while the film was being made), FM still stands out as a sort of classic rock answer, at least in soundtrack terms, to the disco onslaught of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.  Also, the idea of a radio station's on-air staff and program director rallying against excess on-air commercialization in which the music is merely the filler between efforts to part listeners from their hard-earned money has to a certain extent come true in the last few years, as big media giants like Clear Channel keep chewing up the landscape for their own financial and political gain.

The film is notable also for a few other things.  It is the only feature film directed by John A. Alonzo, better known as one of Hollywood's great cinematographers, whose credits include SCARFACE, CHINATOWN, BLACK SUNDAY, and parts of Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  And besides having a killer soundtrack, it also sports concert footage of Jimmy Buffett (a.k.a. ""Mr. Margaritaville"") doing ""Livingston Saturday Night"", and Linda Ronstadt doing ""Tumbling Dice"", ""Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me"", and even Elvis' 1956 classic ""Love Me Tender"" (the concert footage was taken from Linda's performance in Houston on her SIMPLE DREAMS tour shortly after the King's passing in August 1977).

Even if only seen as a time capsule depiction of L.A. in the late 1970s, FM stands up as a look at what radio was like before MTV, Clear Channel, and over-commercialization caused it to rot.  Alternately seriocomic and dramatic, with a very likeable cast, it is well worth seeing.",1115769600,36,2874,4.907216494845361
433202,4,6302161479,"""FM"" is a fun, light-weight, movie comedy for anyone who has an interest in radio or late '70s rock n'roll in general. The film has arguably been regarded by it's fans as the template or inspiration for the classic CBS TV sitcom, ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".This episodic movie takes place in late 1970's L.A. at the offices and studios of Q-Sky, the #1 radio station in the area. It's hilariously, presided over by manager, Jeff Dugan (a likable Michael Brandon),who's main job seems to be keeping in line, the crazy DJs and other personnel, who make up the station's looney, staff. These folks are constantly getting themselves into trouble both on and off the air. They include Mother (Eileen Brennan) a burned out hippie, who wants to chuck it all, Eric Swann (Martin Mull)a pompas idiot, who will do anything to further his career, The Prince (Cleavon Little), the hip black dude of the bunch and finally Doc (Alex Karras), a suicidal cowboy. The main plot centers on how Jeff and the gang fight to keep the evil account executive and the station owner from oversaturating the station's airwaves with wall to wall ads for the U.S. Army. Yes, the plotline is sort of silly and dated. But put on your average FM station today and you'll find that the movie's premise has pretty much come true. The air waves are mostly ads with a little bit of music squeezed in. Highlights of this film include excellent,live '70s era, in-concert appearances by music artists, Linda Ronstadt (""Tumbling Dice"" ""Poor Pitiful Me"") and Jimmy Buffett (""Livingston Saturday Night""). If you are a fan of either of these performers then you will relish this concert footage. Also look for a brief cameo from rocker, Tom Petty. Finally listen for the film's great classic rock soundtrack which includes '70s staples such as Steely Dan, Bob Seger, Boston, Billy Joel, the Doobie Brothers and much more. For an evening of light-hearted comedy I highly recommend ""FM"".",1056326400,9,1936,4.851963746223565
