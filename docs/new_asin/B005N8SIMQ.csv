4844750,5,B005N8SIMQ,"I've became a fan of STP over the past few years, I've always heard their songs growing up but wasn't familar at the time. Just recently saw old STP videos and live videos and I was blown away. Then I heard about the Live in the Windy City dvd, I purchased it and was impressed. You can tell Scott's years of drug abuse has caught up with him but he still sings well and still has the crazy energy as he did in the 90s. So I recommend this dvd to any STP fan.",1342051200,3,459,3.893617021276596
4844751,5,B005N8SIMQ,"I come from Paris and I will try to explain how I feel about this DVD.

First of all I was waiting for a Stone Temple Pilot DVD to be released a long time ago, they are the last ""grunge"" band (are they really?) of our time, they survived the 2000's.

Why Scott Weiland always surprises me? I mean you could swear that his voice and performance will suck big time after all he went trough but like always he surprises me again and again:

 Very nice intro, nice lights and background. They did make lots of effort on that point and results are beautiful. A big screen with waves during Creep, Circles during Plush...beautiful set up and different in EVERY single song.

Apparently Dean DeLeo added some effect on his guitar that really shines his playing. It does some amazing solos to end the songs, lots of personality in his playing and more depth than before. A guitar player will learn a thing or two.

Robert has a nice voice that you will have a chance to ear! Excellent backing, the DVD sounds very good in general.

Then Scott climbs his podium and it's on you know that's going to get crazy, he is on fire threw the whole concert. What a voice !!! He is a lot more mature then before in his voice and his performance at 44 years old don't except him to jump and bend like before and that's a good thing. My gosh what a style he has! It will inspire your dancing, I dare you not to dance above your bed during Crackerman. Make no mistake Scott might speak slowly and so on but on stage he is ELECTRIC.

If you want to see a stylish, mature and tight rock band live, buy this it will be your best purchase in a long  long long time!",1341619200,24,1639,4.210862619808307
4844752,5,B005N8SIMQ,"Great dvd!  I forgot how much I loved STP back in my high school days.  Seen STP on tour back in 1996, this dvd took me back to some great times.  I would recommend any fan of rock to check this dvd out.",1341100800,10,203,3.6744186046511627
4844753,3,B005N8SIMQ,"This is a standard-fare live DVD for a band of STP's caliber, no doubt released due to contractual obligation rather than a labor of love on the band's part.

The band (Robert, Dean and Eric) all sound full-bodied and muscular throughout the performance, and the band as a whole doesn't deviate from the studio recordings. The only difference is Scott's voice, which is ragged and worn from years of alcohol and drug abuse.

In an age where Black Sabbath isn't Black Sabbath thanks to Sharon Osbourne's greed prohibiting Bill Ward from participating and Van Halen can't mount a serious tour without wanting to kill each other, it's a testament to STP's legacy that the four band members can continue to tour together, given all of Scott's demons.

Demons which are sadly apparent on this DVD in certain places.

For one, Scott's physical health. When he takes his coat off after opening number ""Vaseline"", I honest to God thought he was pregnant, his beer belly is so noticeable.

The most obvious demon is his mental capacity, as seen in the boring, by-the-numbers bonus interview included on the DVD. Eric Kretz doesn't utter one word during the entire 15 minute feature, instead choosing to glower at Weiland from across the room. Scott has difficulty forming anything close to an articulate sentence, again due to the years of drink and drug abuse he has inflicted on his body. It's both comical and sad to witness. The whole interview sounds forced and uncomfortable.

Additionally, during his between-song banter with the crowd, he sounds inebriated and leans heavily on his mic stand, as though he's about to fall over. He appears to be drinking Gatorade from a bottle between songs; maybe there is vodka in there, too?

All of this aside, the band turns out an overall decent performance on the main feature. The crowd seems to enjoy the band, and vice versa. The band *sounds* great once they pick up steam about midway through the set. I wish they'd included more deep cuts instead of the standard ""greatest hits plus a few new songs"" set, but that's knitpicking. The plethora of live performances found on the DVD that comes with the deluxe ""Thank You"" hits album are much more representative of the band in its live element, back when Scott was still coherent (or high out of his mind) and the band burned like a Middle Eastern summer nightly.

Alive In The Windy City is worthwhile for longtime STP fans (are there any other kind of STP fans at this point?), but won't mean much else outside of that demographic.",1340841600,11,2525,4.775229357798165
4844754,5,B005N8SIMQ,"Nice Concert, Waiting for that, Scott Weiland's vocal and musical style has proved to be versatile, evolving constantly throughout his career... excellent Live Show.!",1340755200,,166,5.958333333333333
4844755,4,B005N8SIMQ,"I thought the overall performance was excellent. They seemed to generally recreate the sound from the albums, which is just fine for me. Scott Weiland, in particular, seemed to keep to the script of the original studio tracks with minimal nonsense. Thanks for that, Scott. I wish ""Big Bang Baby"" had been included in the setlist but I won't cry about it. I love live concerts shot in theaters of this size. The sound and direction always seems to benefit from it. The band was tight and Scott's voice was in fine form. I can't recall an instance of him lowering the key because he couldn't hit the note. (That's always an epic disappointment for me) I think fans of STP, both devoted and casual, will enjoy this.",1340668800,35,712,4.5703125

4844773,4,B005N8SIMQ,"Very good sounding show although doesn't take advantage of the capacity of the disk itself by far. Bonus feature include a 15 minutes interview which covers the period prior to the 2010's albums release and has a nice pace, but other than that not special features whatsoever. The show itself takes about 80 minutes. Now for the video quality. It has mostly a grainy - movie effect to it which I don't mind. The sharpest shots are from the audience section - front row(ish). The camera angle on the drummer from his left side is really bad and its clearly out of focus the whole show. There are many decent close up shots of each members and it's shot very dynamically but not chaotically. Then there some another very unpleasant camera shots which leave kind of slideshow like impression and are hurting the whole thing rather than helping it. There is very little interaction with audience and songs are cut together with little or no talking at all. The dramatic concept of the show is presented poorly. The band though is in a top form. Scott is doing very good. The other members are almost flawless. I give it a 4 out of 5.",1467590400,,1129,4.53921568627451

4844779,5,B005N8SIMQ,STP in the final ORIGINAL form live in great shape here. Scott Weiland was a great front man when he was in his zone wished they would have done more from the last album which i happen to love.it's still very sad how a great band will never be the same if i can be bold in saying this after the CHESTER thing ended I'm thinking we might have seen yet another Weiland reunion in spite of the poison spawn by both sides because there was a magical connection between them. Now we can't have this ever again. VERY SAD but we have our memories and this is a great one on dvd.,1462492800,2,571,4.061946902654867

4844781,5,B005N8SIMQ,"STP was in top form for this show in 2010.  I saw them in my city back 2001 and they rocked just as much.  If Scott could have beat his drug addiction, I think the band could've settled their differences.

4844795,4,B005N8SIMQ,"Solid concert and good production. The interview at the end is pretty cool. Overall, they don't blow me away with a five star performance, but all the STP classics are very strong performances. This was surely the last hurrah for this band. They were really all good musicians, and tight as a band, but Scott Weiland had something special.

Great tracks: Vasoline, Crackerman, Wicked Garden, Hickory Dichotomy, Big Empty, Creep, Plush, Interstate Love Song, Sex Type Thing, Dead And Bloated, Piece Of Pie, Trippin On A Hole In A Paper Heart.

Just okay tracks: Sour Girl, Lounge Fly.

4844813,5,B005N8SIMQ,"I admit that I purchased this Stone Temple pilots dvd of  Stone Temple Pilots Alive In The Windy City on April 9, 2015. However, I have previously been familiar with the music of Stone Temple Pilots for quite some time due to the fact that a family member generously gifted me with the Tiny Music Songs From The Vatican Gift Shop by Stone Temple Pilots around the time I was 16 years old. Additionally, the alternative rock station I frequently listened to from the time I was around 14 until I was 19 (radio station Q101 that was based out of Chicago, Illinois until I moved away after enlisting in the U.S. navy in 2000)often played various songs by Stone Temple Pilots. I even purchased and reviewed the Thank You cd on September 13, 2009 after coming across STP greatest hits compilation in a local Orlando Florida library a couple miles from the University of Central Florida (I left the review on the Amazon UK website).  Purchasing this dvd is well worth is because the bands music harmonizes well with Scot Weilands vocals in the concert performance.  With this said, I also enjoy music by Linkin Park and have even purchased their recent Hunting Party cd at my job over six months ago.  Im well aware I may get some unhelpful votes for this because it is not a popular sentiment. However, using the name of  Stone Temple Pilots without Scott Weilands powerful music vocals is akin to taking Mike Shinoda or Chester Bennington out of Linkin Park and still calling them Linkin Park.  Back to the dvd set,  many of the classic hits by Stone Temple Pilots are included on this dvd; Vasoline, Wicked Garden, Big Empty, Sour Girl, Creep, Plush, Interstate Love Song etc. (18 songs).  My favorite songs cd wise from Stone Temple Pilots are Wicked Garden, Plush, and Vaseline. The band gave their best unified performance in this dvd concert edition and I would have to say that these were some of my favorite performances concert wise even though the songs have a melancholy tune; Sour Girl, Interstate Love Song, Dead and Bloated, and Trippin On A Hole In a Paper Heart (which is also the closing song on the concert dvd). There is also a bonus feature of an interview with STP.",1429920000,3,2181,4.6175710594315245

4844818,4,B005N8SIMQ,"The  Stone Temple Pilots DVDS is a total trip! Everyone, from the camera operators on through Scott and the band, and all the way to the editing room, is on their game for this one. The set list is excellent. The sound mix is rich and full. The camera work and editing are done for people who appreciate watching the artists. There is no attention deficit disorder quick cuts that befall so many of the other crappy quality concert videos that are available now.
The songs from their new album at the time, eponymusly titled, were even well received. That is a rarity at a rock show when people use the new song space to go to the bathroom.
Scott's voice is in fine form. He ownshe is part of the stage throughout the show and does not let up. The guitarist, Dean DiLeo, is amazing as always. He switches through several different guitars, dependingon the song and the tuning required. Also he plays a good bit of slide guitar. And it is excellent. Robert and Eric, are as tight as can be. This show is a must own for any fan of the band.
 Alas, this tour was the last one with Scott. I went to see the group on this to her when they visited Charlotte North Carolina. Thatshow was equally good and I even got to slap hands with Robert, the bass player during one of the numbers. I am glad and consider myself lucky to finally have caught the band live

4844831,5,B005N8SIMQ,It's about time that STP released a concert DVD and it's been worth the wait. The audio and video was very good and the performance was spot on. I give this concert a 8.,1382400000,,169,4.0
4844832,5,B005N8SIMQ,This Blue Ray was a must have for my collection as the band no longer exsists as featured in the Blue Ray. I was very pleased by the exceptional length of this Blue Ray and the songs played. Next best thing to being at the live show.,1382227200,,233,3.978723404255319

4844834,5,B005N8SIMQ,"I have always been able to easily tell if a live performance was not really live and this one sounded so good that I had to look real hard to believe it.  I didn't listen to the CDs enough to know every note of the music but I do think I know enough to realize that this was not the same but sounded very close.  It was too perfect almost and too close to the CD, but not the CD.  A couple of the songs I didn't know that well,  so maybe they were nothing like the CD; but that is moot, this is beautiful work no matter how you slice it.

If you like STP you will like this.",1376265600,,574,3.75
4844835,5,B005N8SIMQ,"It's a shame that STP can't get along, because this DVD presents them sounding fantastic.  I originally saw a heavily edited version of this on VH1 and also the Palladia channel, but even on Hi Def TV it does not match the quality of the Blu-ray.  Great concert, great images and sounds, and definitely recommended for STP fans.",1375660800,,328,4.637931034482759
4844836,5,B005N8SIMQ,"I have a very high end home theater system.  I buy live rock BluRays frequently to see if they can recapture the magic of a live performance.

Most of the time, that goal comes up short.  But, this disk has the best sound quality I have ever heard.  Period.  This is truly a ""Demo Disk"" to show off your system.

The fact that it's the best rock band of the last 20 years doing an amazing set is a bonus.  Buy it for the sound quality, love it for the music.",1374624000,,458,3.967032967032967

4844839,5,B005N8SIMQ,"After years of drug abuse, I was expecting Scott Wieland to be a train wreck but was more than surprised (and pleased) that he sounded as great as ever. He's still thin but in shape. The DeLeo brothers play every note true to their original recordings and drummer Eric lays down their perfect grunge/punk beat. Although recorded in 2008, that's a pretty good run for a band from the early 90's. I've only had it a few weeks and have already played it 3 times at max volume I can get away with. I don't think any STP fans will be disappointed.",1367107200,,542,4.323529411764706

4844842,4,B005N8SIMQ,STP is one of my most favourite bands. This concert is a great comeback. It's so full of energy. I specially like the new songs. Their 2010-album is their best I think. Sound quality of this blu-ray is very good. De editing is too fast for my taste. I'd rather see the concert the way the audience has seen it. Otherwise it's very OK.,1362787200,3,334,4.234375
4844843,4,B005N8SIMQ,"Let me first say that I am not much of a fan of STP after ""Core"" but I liked the concert overall.  Not surprised about the performance considering the set list contained some pretty bad songs that they had to promote and play anyway, I guess, though the songs that they chose that were bad were REALLY BAD in my opinion.  Some camera views are not in HD, mainly the vews behind Eric Kretz.  I did enjoy some songs from ""Purple"" and liked the songs they chose from that album, but other than that the only songs that I liked were from their debut, Now that I've gotten to the worst parts of the concert let's look at the positives other than song choices:

-The video doesn't really skip too much from one camera to another and the sequences are longer than some other concert videos I've seen in the past.where they try to show you too much of what's going on (split screens; short flashes of the band members when the video doesn't seem to fit how the beat is going or not showing the band members at the appropriate times for solos, etc.).

-Their best songs were great for the most part.  The performances of ""Crackerman"", ""Wicked Garden"", ""Creep"", ""Plush"", ""Sex Type Thing"", and ""Dead and Bloated"",were the best of the concert, although ""Lounge Fly"" and ""Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart"" were great too.

4 is a little high for a rating for this Blu-ray concert even though I gave it a four.  I give it a 3.5 overall.",1361664000,,1425,4.371212121212121

Great set--always want to see some personal faves in there though.  Great sound, great picture.  The interview's a drag.  I seriously question the group's and its members' well-being.  And I love these guys.  I would've liked to've seen a picture gallery or maybe some bonus rehearsal/sound check footage.  Excellent show; STP's the best live act I've ever seen.  Hands down.  Just wanted a little more on the DVD.",1359417600,,549,4.869565217391305

A decent setlist (from their last tour, from 2009 to 2011), good image quality, good DTS audio, a very good shape of the band itself...

4844857,5,B005N8SIMQ,I was very happy to get this blu ray in the mail.  I've been a big fan of STP for most of my life.  They still got an amazing stage present.  I was blown away.  He was all wasted slinking around on stage and even kissed one of the guitar players on the mouth while he was playing.  A few times scott looked like he was itchin for some smack.  Together this is ther perfect combination for a wonderful concert.  This is by far the best STP concert i've seen!!,1348963200,,458,4.022222222222222
4844858,4,B005N8SIMQ,"I'm going to start by saying I really wanted to give this 5 stars.  Because this is the only STP DVD there is, I'd say go buy it if you want to see the band live.  My only problem with this is the obvious over dubbing of the vocals and I'm not sure why.  We all know that most things sound better in the studio than they do live but the energy is here.  The band sounds great, the set list is fanstastic.  Scott is flamboyant like a cross between Jagger and Bowie.  So my problem is.....If you look really closely, there are times when the audio and video are not in sync and it drives me nuts.  Why bother to show close up shots of Scott singing if it's not perfectly in sync with the music?  The DVD does get better with this issue on the second half.  All in all, go get it because it's the only one out there.",1348790400,,813,3.9691358024691357
4844859,4,B005N8SIMQ,"Being a longtime STP fan, I was excited to learn of this release and eagerly ordered it here at Amazon. I had been waiting for a live DVD from this band for a decade!

Technically, it's a fine disc -- with great picture and sound (at least on my system).

My main complaint is not so much with the DVD, but the set list for this particular concert. This is a usual gripe I have with bands. While all the hits are covered here, it would have been nice if gems such as Church On Tuesday, Big Bang Baby, Army Ants, Unglued or Glide had been part of this set. But, I suppose that's a no-win wish list for me and I know we all have our own preferred set lists that never become reality in a live show.

The interview with the band -- included as an extra -- is a complete joke. The questions are not very in depth, but then, the responses to the questions actually made me chuckle. I don't know if the band was stoned or tired at the time but the whole interview was like something out of This Is Spinal Tap. The questions and answers were laughable. I found myself saying ""Well, duh!"" to myself quite often while watching this.

If you're an STP fan, this DVD is worth having. And, since it's all we've got...it's hard to be too critical. I wish older performances from their 90's heyday were available on DVD for purchase.

Overall, I recommend it.",1346716800,4,1345,4.23828125

My only little qualm is I wish the editors wouldn't have cut out so much of the down time between songs and other nuances. These things add to the experience and make the viewer feel more like they were really there. But over all a great buy,1496534400,,386,4.5285714285714285
