8482276,5,B005P1XRCM,The Native humor shines through in this low budget zombie flick. Grab some popcorn and enjoy a evening of laughs and great story telling. Rod Pocowatchit shines as a Native film maker.,1515542400,,184,4.78125
8482277,4,B005P1XRCM,"Better than many zombie movies, and had some humorous parts. For a low budget film they did pretty good. I was in the mood for a silly zombie movie that wasn't too gory, and this fit the bill.  Some parts had good suspense, while others dragged somewhat.",1514505600,,254,4.404255319148936
8482278,4,B005P1XRCM,"This is a good-natured, ultra-low-budget, campy comedy-drama with serious family and cultural themes. It maintains a light touch throughout. The quality of the material is only so-so, good for chuckles, but it may have extra appeal for those in sympathy with the Indian cultural themes.

It follows some of the conventions of the zombie genre but not all. The protagonists aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer when it comes to dealing with zombies, but that's in keeping with the genre. There's a little gore, some swearing.

The historical irony of whom the plague affects and whom it doesn't is hammered home, but with a light hammer. There's a long review (not by me) at fourthcinemablog for those interested in the serious points.

The music soundtrack is pretty good. (No Dead Can Dance, though.)",1509235200,,805,4.992537313432836
8482279,5,B005P1XRCM,"A very low budget film, but they did a good job making it. Great story line, and some very funny parts.",1504310400,,103,3.9523809523809526

8482282,4,B005P1XRCM,"Probably a little too generous with the 4 stars but I really liked the effort and energy put into this campy, low budget, interesting twist on the zombie genre.  Don't watch this for the latest special effects, don't watch this for ""authentic"" survival techniques should you happen to wake up one morning to the zombie apocalypse; however, do watch this is you are a supporter of Native films, get a kick out of inside inter-tribal jokes, like to see characters and side plots that other Natives can relate to or chuckle about because it reminds them of a family member or friend, and if you want to see some never before-seen zombie behavior (good zombie likes hearing sound from cell phones and radios, saves humans from other zombies, and stays in touch with his human friends via cell phone...).",1377129600,2,799,4.748201438848921
