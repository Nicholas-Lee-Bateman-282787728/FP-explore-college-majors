8175534,5,B0006FO4Z6,"I don't surf and still Riding Giants is one of my favorite documentaries. It follows the history of big wave surfing from the 50's to present day; focusing on the North Shore, Mavericks and tow in surfing. The footage of the surfers riding those giant waves is breath taking. The courage, tenacity and athleticism demonstrated by these surfers is inspirational.

Dogtown, follows the lives of ""the original skateboarding cool kids"". It is pretty incredible what theses guys were doing and the equipment that they were doing it with. This is not for younger kids. There is some language and some not so happy endings for some of the guys. If you're curious about how skate boarding went from side walk fun to the giant commercial industry that it is today this is well worth viewing.",1316908800,,782,4.792592592592593
8175535,5,B0006FO4Z6,"Great 2 DVD set that appears similar on outside but is very different from both how you enjoy it and how you would review it as a film critic.  Giants is best thing I have seen and I could watch it almost every night.  I do surf, but have plenty non-surfing friends of all ages who also like it.  Dogtown follows same outline with skateboarding, but is tremendously self indulgent in the skaters glorifying themselves.  The surfers are downright humble by comparison.  Summary - great to watch, but could also be used by a film class to compare/contrast the two.",1124409600,6,562,4.58
