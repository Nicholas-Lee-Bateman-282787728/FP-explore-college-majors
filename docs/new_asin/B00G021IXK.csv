6042318,5,B00G021IXK,"This instructional DVD is very well done.  Comprehensive, but, easy to understand.  I highly recommend it if you own or plan to purchase a Canon 70D.",1390435200,12,149,4.6923076923076925
6042319,5,B00G021IXK,"packed with very useful information, a lot of this information was new to me. Easy to understand. I highly recommend this course if you have Canon 70D and want to get maximum from this camera",1389484800,9,191,4.485714285714286
6042320,5,B00G021IXK,This DVD course is packed with useful information for anyone wanting to learn photography.  My wife is just starting out and this was a life saver.  Much better than just digging into the manuals and books on the subject.  Gives you a real leg up on the learning curve with not only the canon 70D but with photography in general.  How and why to make setting adjustments on the camera as opposed to just using auto mode.,1389312000,8,420,4.415584415584416
6042321,5,B00G021IXK,I saw a bunch or tutorials but this was by far the best to simplify the canon. love it made the transition very easily thank the this.,1387497600,4,134,4.0
6042322,5,B00G021IXK,Its really teaches you the basics i would buy more of his videos if the price were less as i only paid this much for this video cause i really needed help and its very professionally done.,1386633600,5,188,4.108108108108108
6042323,5,B00G021IXK,"This is the second tutorial I have purchased from Michael. As always, the tutorials are informative and easy to follow. Today, digital cameras are extremely complex and loaded with features. It can be pretty overwhelming. I found trying to read the owners manual helpful but not enough. Within the first hour of viewing the DVD I already had a better understanding of my camera than I did in the hours spent trying to read the manual. The price is right and this is the fastest and easiest way I have found to learn a camera and all of it's functions. He breaks things down into terms and lessons I can understand. The DVD is easy to navigate and the lessons are broken down into chapters so you can go back whenever you need to. I recommend his products to all of my friends and family.",1383264000,25,787,4.43448275862069
6042324,5,B00G021IXK,It has helped me more than any learning method I have tried.,1417651200,,60,4.083333333333333
6042325,2,B00G021IXK,"You almost pay double  compared to a similar product  because they fill the DVD with information that was not mentioned on Amazon or is it on the subject which should be solely the 70D camera. There are chapters on Michaels Digital Photography School and Michaels Composition Course. They call these ""bonuses"". However the Blue Crane DVD on the 70D also sold by Amazon is almost 1/2 the price and similar in quality. If they stripped away the filler and priced it fairly it would be  good buy.",1416355200,2,493,4.64367816091954
6042326,5,B00G021IXK,"Excellent DVD tutorial. Material presented slowly and clearly. As a novice, I didn't feel like I was being left in the dust.
The best photography DVD I've found and I have quite a few.",1413158400,,184,4.4411764705882355
6042327,5,B00G021IXK,"Love the product. Michael speaks very clearly than anyone who's English is not their first language can understand.
I just bought the camera and now I understand the basics and more. It was worth what I paid for and like Mark said, it's good that people who buy his videos legally are supporting his work.
What I liked the most is that not only it's a video about the camera but also a photography crash course and for me, that was a plus, because I just started learning photography.
Thanks for making things much easier.",1412812800,,522,4.505263157894737
6042328,5,B00G021IXK,My husband has been teaching me photography for over 30 years! He thought that showing me this DVD would answer all of my questions  IT DID THAT; BUT IT ALSO GAVE ME A WHOLE NEW BUCKET OF QUESTIONS TO ASK HIM WHEN HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF TAKING A PHOTO THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN MINUTES.,1409184000,,309,3.9838709677419355

6042332,5,B00G021IXK,Very informative easy to follow format.,1404864000,,39,5.666666666666667
6042333,5,B00G021IXK,This is a great video to get you fully acquainted with the 70D.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has one of these amazing cameras.,1399766400,,134,4.153846153846154
6042334,5,B00G021IXK,"Bought this DVD to go with my new 70D.  The manual that comes with the camera is pretty useless.  This DVD is outstanding for both beginners and intermediate shooters.  The first part of the DVD appears to be ""canned"" information about digital shooting in general (very useful review).  The second half is dedicated to the 70D and unlocks many secrets and shortcuts that would take the casual user forever to discover.  Well worth the price.
I am not a professional and use my 70D sporadically and find myself referring back to this DVD often.",1398211200,,543,4.73404255319149
6042335,3,B00G021IXK,just a basic dvd nothing special  If you know nothing this is very simple start to simple commands not very long,1397779200,,112,4.333333333333333
6042336,5,B00G021IXK,"This video is an excellent tutorial. It is extremely thorough. No great shakes with the production value, but it presents the information you need. I had also purchased the Blue Crane 70D video because of my satisfaction with their series on the 60D, but they really did little more than a thumbnail overview on the 70D. For about the same price this one is 100% better.",1397347200,,370,4.621212121212121
6042337,4,B00G021IXK,"It is a very useful course to understand 70D !
Clips are good to Show how to hand le this new camera.",1396569600,2,101,3.6363636363636362
6042338,5,B00G021IXK,I love this dvd!!!! It's in plain understandable English. It has helped me so much. Canon should include it with the 70D!! Much better than the often hard to understand manual.,1395619200,7,176,4.709677419354839
6042339,5,B00G021IXK,"It is worth the money I paid for it. I keep watching it over and over because there is a lot of information and it is very easy to forget when you actually need it. However, my photography skills have improved tremendously and I know my camera a lot better now. Please be aware that at least 2/3 of the video focuses on photography in general, not just the Canon 70D. However, there is enough coverage of the camera itself.",1395273600,,423,4.3
6042340,5,B00G021IXK,"SInce I recently bought the EOS 70D as an upgrade from the Rebel T4i that I had for a little over a year, I knew I had to get this tutorial.  I learned much more from these DVDs than I ever did with the users manual, which isn't exactly an intuitive way for me to learn.  Seeing and doing is best for me.  This is the 3rd one I've bought and I love all of them.  Thanks to The Maven for making learning enjoyable.  It takes the mystery out of the equation and replaces it with confidence.",1395273600,,488,3.9896907216494846
6042341,5,B00G021IXK,"I bought the Blue Crane, Michael the Maven and the Canon DVD that comes with the 70D kit.  After watching all 3 of these training DVDs, I can objectively say that Michael the Maven is the most helpfull at walking you through all of the camera's features and settings.  I've only bought Blue Crane DVDs in the past for other cameras, but now I'm sold on Michael the Maven's training courses.",1394755200,7,390,4.47887323943662
6042342,5,B00G021IXK,"If you're new to digital photography, or just new to the 70D, I'd highly recommend.  Best money I've spent on educational material in some time.  Thanks for all the great work Michael, would highly recommend.",1392940800,10,208,4.914285714285715
6042343,5,B00G021IXK,"I bought my wife this Awesome Camera for Christmas. We had a Point and Shoot. This DVD had her up and running in no time. She's not an ""automatic"" setting type of person, so she really wanted to know the in's and out's of the new camera and this DVD had her adjusting settings like a Pro! Very informative and set up so you can do certain lessons and then come back and do other lessons at your own pace. You will view it more than once because it's Sooo informative, but in a good way!
I made a Very,Very, Good Choice when i added this to the Christmas gift and you will too!",1392854400,8,576,4.06140350877193
8619831,5,B00G021IXK,"Great video, before this video I didn't know a thing about this camera. I read the manual but it didn't give me the whole concept. Mike explained the concept of photography, lens, the ins and outs of the 70d camera, how to take great pictures and so much more. I will be back for more of your videos Mike!!! Thank you for making this great video.",1454716800,,346,4.257575757575758

8619837,5,B00G021IXK,"Outstanding course. It goes beyond just the workings of the Canon 70D. Michael is an excellent instructor on both the camera workings and photography.  I learned a lot from this DVD.  I also bought the DVD on the Canon 580 EX ii flash unit. Again, just outstanding. He goes into the full spectrum of flash photography. Way beyond just the workings of the flash unit.  The reason I bought the 70D DVD is I upgraded from the Canon T3i.  I had his DVD on the T3i, so I knew the DVD on the 70D had to be just as good. I highly recommend his DVD's to anyone interested in really learning how to operate their camera or learn about photography in general.",1424822400,,649,4.295081967213115
8619838,5,B00G021IXK,This is a great DVD to get comfortable with the 70D.Michael goes into detail with all the bells and whistles on this camera and more. This DVD is programed so you can skip subjects that  don't interest you. As a beginner I went to 70D segment and after just one view I was comfortable with the camera.,1421280000,,301,4.280701754385965
8619839,5,B00G021IXK,"Michael has a true passion for what he does and it shows. But not only is he a wonderful photographer, he's an educator with the rare ability to take mundane tech speak and turn into a photography crash course thriller. This DVD is packed with information, and broken down into nice chunks/segments that make it fun and interesting for novices and professionals alike. Canon honestly should ship all their cameras with his respective DVDs, they're just so good.

This is really all you need, then sign up for his website and youtube for more free stuff. This guy can teach you everything you need to know.

These DVD's are fun to watch, but not dumbed down. And his constantly changing hair dos add some additional flair and entertainment.",1421193600,3,739,4.765625
