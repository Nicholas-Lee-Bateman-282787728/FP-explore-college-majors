8423462,5,B004CRR9GK,Great informative show,1449187200,,22,6.666666666666667
8423463,5,B004CRR9GK,"A wonderful series. Even more wonderful, this episode. Something about hearing how ordinary folk rose from the ashes to become timeless Sci Fi Icons known around the world. Many of them in the beginning having ideas way ahead of their time, they persevered through everything from bad ratings, some to right out rejection(s). But to hear how they came back with a vengeance, believing very strongly in their ideas, was nothing short of inspiring.",1440720000,,446,5.04054054054054
8423464,5,B004CRR9GK,"This was a wonderful examination of the history of science fiction television from the golden era. It covers some of the most important television shows by expounding on their Genesis and exploring the impact these shows had on popular culture. Part of a larger collection, this program stands alone nicely. Even though I am a fan of golden age television I was not interested in purchasing the whole series. PBS allowed me to purchase the program I was most interested in. For the price, this is a must have for fans of sixties television and science fiction.",1406332800,2,560,4.783505154639175
8423465,4,B004CRR9GK,"This is a great series and being a science fiction fan and old enough to have seen these shows when they premiered, I enjoyed learning more about them.",1399075200,,151,4.428571428571429
8423466,3,B004CRR9GK,"While the content is okay, it is weird how they tried to ""re-create"" the old sets of some shows, putting in new actors and making it look like it was behind-the-scenes filming from the original series.  Laughable was the fat guy they put in place of Shatner.  I will say they tried to re-create the original look, but it's so fake.  If they just stuck with original clips and a making-of story, it would have been better.",1397779200,,421,4.441558441558442
8423467,2,B004CRR9GK,"This program was totally inaccurate. CBS did not listen to Gene Roddenberry's ideas about how to produce a science fiction television series just to use them for a series they liked better, Irwin Allen's Lost IN Space. Rather, CBS was much more interested in having a business deal with a star producer, Irwin Allen who had alreadymarked success with producing the first science fiction television series on television, Voyage to the bottom of the Sea. According to Marc Cushman's execellent book series on Lost in Space, Gene Roddenberry made up this story about CBS wanting to listen to him to merely use his ideas for producing star trek to placate his wounded ego. Irwin allen was s producer who didn't butt heads with the network, he was content to work within the system which meant that the adult actors like Guy Williams and June Lockhart weren't allowed to kiss and the children in the series were not allowed to be put in moral danger and they wanted more comedy in the series which Jonathan Harris was ready to placate them in that regard. But wahts unfortunate that nayone watching this documentary will get the complete distorted views of Gene Roddenberry's twisted side of the story. The truth is that CBS was not willing to go with a rebel type producer who had zero track record in producing any sort of science fiction series while Irwin Allen have a proven record of doing so. PBS should really refilm this whole mess and state the truth. not the fantasy that they produced.",1375142400,,1492,4.742307692307692
