7869984,5,6304397526,"This is one of my favorite Garner movies! This is when HBO still made great movies! Garner is great as a cop
who's fed up with the job and the politics and the new glitter dome world! Him and his partner investigate a
murder and turn up some bizarre and strange things. The ending is good but kinda sad as his partner does
something....I won't ruin the ending....this is a lost gem for Garner and great cable tv movies!",1480636800,,419,4.3164556962025316

7869987,3,6304397526,"There is a song about a ""lost chord"" an absent-minded pianist accidentally plays, and then can never figure out how to produce again. For many years, this movie was like that to me.
  I saw parts of this movie Long ago, when it aired as a made for TV movie. Intrigued, I wanted to see the whole thing, but I never saw it again. This is understandable:The lurid plotline, highly exploitive of (and thus dependent on) the social phobias of its time (1984 - ""Kiddie porn!"" ""snuff films!""), likely hardly recommended itself to network programmers of later years. But I could not get it out of my head.
  I never found a copy for rent, and I gave up on finding a DVD version for purchase. In the end, I broke down and bought a combination DVD/VHS player, just so I could play a VHS of this movie (and one other)!
  My results where mixed. The tape was technically fine. The cast is impressive - Garner & Lithgow together is worth the price of admission by itself. And the performances are okay. I cannot point to any one aspect of this film I would call a significant failure. But there is something . . . missing.
  At the end of the day, I find I don't really care about any of these characters. They are all foolish, in ways I can't respect. The ""good guys"" are presented as defenders of civilization, but their opposition is so implausible that I just don't buy the message - I have seen more realistic bad guys in anime.
  I can't say I regret buying this movie, as it had grown into something I needed to check off my life's ""to do"" list. But I also must admit I was a little disappointed.",1250985600,6,1590,4.305369127516778
7869988,4,6304397526,"This is a tough watch. Behind Garner, Lithgow and Kidder's glib repartee lurks a very dark tale of pornography, murder and suicide. The director, Stuart Margolin, is probably best known as Rockford's buddy ""Angel"". He shows a good knowledge of classic noir looks and themes. Taking direction from his buddy, Garner is willing to make fun of his characters many shortcomings, including too much drink and a couple of ""erectile dysfunction"" moments. Lithgow is on the verge of breaking into pieces right in front of camera. At the time, Margot Kidder's ""handcuff me and gag me"" bit made viewers uncomfortable. It is a strong scene that shows off Garner and Kidder's fearless dramatic reach. There are plenty of recognizable faces in the supporting cast, including John Marley (think The Godfather horse head). Colleen Dewhurst nails her role while supplying important exposition. Benson Fong shows up in time to say goodbye. This is a hard movie to find, and never made it to DVD which is too bad. It has the look and feel of the disillusioned cop films of the day and never reveals it's made for cable TV origin. RECOMMENDED.",1249516800,12,1124,4.890052356020942
7869989,2,6304397526,"While containing some good-action sequences and cop interaction between partner's James Garner and John Lithgow(3rd Rock from the Sun) this movie is dismal-besides depressing. Margot Kidder(Superman,fame)is wasted as  pretencious movie-star,Garner romantically entangles with. Based on  best-seller Joesph Wambaurgh's book,I recommend a read before an  eventual-viewing. For fan's of the lead-star's and material of novelist-  Wambaugh's.",959558400,2,438,6.909090909090909
