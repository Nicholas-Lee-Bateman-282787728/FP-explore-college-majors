2863761,1,B000RBA6BU,"I thought the first movie ""Are We There Yet?"" was a cute, funny movie.  This thing was awful.  Even my 9-year-old daughter, who LOVED the first movie, walked out saying that the movie was bad.  The only mildly funny parts were shown in the trailers, the characters were flat and you really didn't care what happened to them.  If you get a chance to see it, don't.  Sorry Ice Cube, but I hope you do better next time.",1177113600,7,416,4.282051282051282
2863762,5,B000RBA6BU,I laughed so hard watching this movie! It is seriously one to see! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. Ice Cube did a great job in bringing this great family movie to life. The story really shows you the importance of families.,1176940800,,229,4.111111111111111
2863763,2,B000RBA6BU,"Is this movie done yet? lets hope so. All the good scenes (not to say they are funny to begin with) was already shown in it's trailer teaser so why do you need to see the movie. Plus, the teenage daughter in this movie as well as JoJo in the RV movie truly represents what it's like to be a spoiled american kid in the United States.",1176076800,,333,3.985074626865672

2863807,2,B000RBA6BU,"This is a cute movie. It is light and funny. The storyline is a bit over used and reminds me of ""The Money Pit"" which is a movie about a house purchased that falls apart. In this film there is the aspect of a remarriage. A step father decides to buy the home without getting it inspected. It falls apart daily piece by piece. The step father works for a magazine. He has not been paid due to him not submitting an article. The mother is not working. If the goal is to teach about finaces this is not the movie. A bank is not going to give a home loan to a one income family who's income is waiting to be paid when he submits an article. Maybe he made bucket loads previously. Maybe he had an inheritance.",1485475200,,704,4.071942446043166

2863955,1,B000RBA6BU,"This is the kind of film so bad that it deserves a public, near-lethal beating. And I'm in the mood to deliver it.

Someone in Hollywood seems to ""have it in"" for classic Cary Grant films. First there was ""The Preacher's Wife"", a remake of a truly fine film, ""The Bishop's Wife"" (with Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven). (It's a Christmas film, thematically similar to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and I can't recommend it highly enough.) ""Preacher's"" was apparently intended as a vehicle for the late Whitney Houston's singing. I watched the first 15 minutes, and was so upset by its awfulness that I couldn't watch any more.

Sunday night, while browsing the newspaper, I chanced across ""Are We Done Yet?"" and decided to give it a try. The opening credits said it was adapted from another Grant film, ""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"", an unquestioned minor classic. Grant -- an ad executive -- and his wife Myrna Loy -- live in a cramped apartment and yearn for more space. The film details their problems in finding -- and restoring -- a suitable house, along with Grant's problems in coming up with a new and improved slogan for Wham ham. It also takes some fairly astute pokes at the advertising industry, before it was fashionable to do so. The screenplay was adapted from a novel of the same name, by none other than Norman Panama & Melvin Frank.

""Done?"" bears only a superficial relationship to ""Blandings"" -- it's about a man fixing up a house -- so one wonders why the producers felt obliged to give credit. (The idea was hardly new. A Jack Benny film, ""George Washington Slept Here"" (made six years earlier), covered the same ground. And then there's Buster Keaton's classic ""One Week"" (1920), in which he and his bride attempt to assemble a kit house.) I'd like to imagine everyone involved with ""Blandings"" rising from the dead and casting the producers of ""Done?"" into the deepest pit of Hell -- ""How dare you claim that our infinitely better film was inspiration for your piece of ****!""

""Blandings"" shows just how much film comedy has declined in 60 years. To get across how small the apartment is, Grant and Loy are shown in close-up maneuvering around each other as they try to use the bathroom's sink & mirror at the same time. The humor builds from the situation, not slapstick. But ""Done?"" has the family in a not-overly-small kitchen, splattering each other with food. It's not just unfunny -- it's stupid.

""Blandings"" tells a coherent story. ""Done?"" simply moves from one lame, unfunny scene to another, without any sense of purpose. The writers have no idea how to write sharp dialog, or build a scene (or sequence) with a beginning, middle, and end. And naturally, they ignore common sense when it gets in the way of of the plot. Nick (Ice Cube) doesn't bother to have the house inspected (which the mortgage company would likely have required), and overlooks the fact the Chuck (John McGinley) lied to him about the house's condition, which would justify a lawsuit.

What is particularly obnoxious about ""Are We Done Yet?"" is that it was actually /made/. The money could have been used for more-worthy ventures. And as an unproduced screenwriter, I'm upset (that's putting it mildly) that the untalented doofuses who wrote this film (Barrett Strong & Norman Whitfield), were actually /paid/ for it. No wonder new writers have so much trouble breaking into Hollywood.

This is one of those films that, as they say, if it were a dog, it would shed. Utter garbage. Emphatically NOT recommended.",1355270400,,3525,4.778325123152709

The chaos is ushered in and directed by the annoying actor who plays the attending doctor on Scrubs.  In this film he's the realtor, general contrator, midwife, code enforcement officer, and general nutcase.  He's not funny, and he's not believable.

The only decent moments include comic relief when Ice Cube falls through the roof or a chandelier falls onto the dining room table, etc, and some of the family moments, as Cube attempts to relate to his step-kids.

This is harmless and watchable, but disappointing and over-the-top (in a bad way) overall.  Purely a rental.",1204243200,3,829,5.051470588235294
2863980,2,B000RBA6BU,"""Are We Done Yet?"" is probably the only film in movie history to be both a sequel to one movie (""Are We There Yet?"") and a remake of another (""Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House"").

The movie picks up where ""Are We There Yet?"" left off, with confirmed bachelor Nick Persons having tied the knot with his main squeeze, Suzanne (Nia Long), and adopted her two children, Kevin and Lindsey.  Desperate to get his new family out of his two-by-four Portland apartment, Nick purchases a home in the country, a dilapidated relic that gives a whole new meaning to the term ""fixer-upper.""

 ""Are We Done Yet?"" starts off with a clever animated title sequence that brings to mind the work of the great Saul Bass in the 1950's and 1960's.  Unfortunately, it's strictly downhill from there.  For bad as it was, the original found at least a modicum of comic tension in the conflict between Nick and the two bratty kids who hated him.  Here Nick is forced to wage an endless battle with an assortment of woodland creatures, shady contractors, loose floorboards, insect infestations, dry rot and a whole host of other homeowner inconveniences.  Far from being antagonists, the other family members are reduced to little more than a grating Greek chorus cynically commenting on the hapless man's nonstop travails.

Ice Cube demonstrates a certain minor flair as an actor, but even Jim Carrey would have trouble making a silk purse out of this pratfall-laden sow's ear.  With its bland mixture of anemic slapstick and gooey sentimentality, ""Are We Done Yet?"" is about as dreadful a movie comedy as has come down the pike in quite some time.  Perhaps a more appropriate title would have been ""Is it Over Yet?""",1193702400,4,1692,4.780068728522337
2863981,3,B000RBA6BU,A pretty good attempt at being a family! It is funny and then not so funny! It is strictly for entertainment and laughs. There is no depth to this movie. Can be viewed by the family.,1190419200,3,182,4.083333333333333
2863982,3,B000RBA6BU,"""Are we Done Yet"" is the sequel to Ice Cubes ""Are We There Yet"" but the two stories really have nothing to do with each other.  You do not need to watch the first movie to enjoy the second.  This movie is your typical silly children's movie.  Its more slapstick then substance but enjoyable nonetheless.  Ice Cube and the actor playing the obnoxious handyman ""Chuck"" are both convincing and decent actors in the movie.

I like the fact that this movie doesn't have any dirty jokes in it, and keeps it clean, a funny movie which the whole family can enjoy.  All I can say is I don't think I will have Sturgeon anytime soon!",1189814400,,354,4.115942028985507

2863985,3,B000RBA6BU,"Are We Done Yet is not as bad as everyone on here would have you believe. Its not as funny as Are We There Yet, but it does hold its own. One thing I did wish they'd touched on is what happened to the kids dad. At the end of the first movie he was with his new wife and baby. Did he just completely forget about them. Anywho my kids loved it and have watched it over and over. Its one of the few movies you can allow your kids to watch without worry of foul language, sex, or violence. It's a good wholesome family movie.",1188950400,,521,3.878504672897196
2863986,4,B000RBA6BU,"I didn't buy this movie because of the reviews given on Amazon. Now that I've rented it, I'm definitely buying it. I was impressed how the movie identified with adults and kids. My whole family enjoyed it from the very funny cartoon credits at the beginning to the happily ever after ending. I would recommend this movie!",1188691200,,321,4.649122807017544
2863987,1,B000RBA6BU,"Ice Cube should have gotten on his hands and knees and begged ""Smokey"" to do a guest appearance in this movie......Maybe it would have made it bearable to watch (just a little) if Chris Tucker had a small part......People, please save your money and your time.  I repeat, ""People, please save your money""!!  If you just got to see, try to buy at the dollar store and ask for half off.....I like the brother and all but Ice Cube need his butt whipped......But Nia Long did have on some cute boots.

2863988,3,B000RBA6BU,"In this sequel to Are We There Yet, Ice Cube is back in his starring role of Nick Persons, who is now a newlywed with a ready-made family in the form of wife Suzanne (Nia Long) and her two children from a previous relationship.  Cramped into what was formerly his bachelor pad, the couple soon learn that they are expecting....twins.  And at Suzanne's urging to find a bigger place to live, the two begin househunting.  It doesn't take long for the Persons family to locate the house of their dreams.  But when things start falling apart around them, Nick begins to see the house as a bit of a nightmare.  Will it take an eccentric real estate agent/contractor/inspector/baby whisperer to make Nick see past all of the repairs for the real home that their new residence could really become?

Fun for the whole family, this is a lighthearted comedy that just about everyone will enjoy.  Not a masterpiece, but is that really required for a little fun?

2863989,4,B000RBA6BU,"This is a very funny film, which blends elements of AWTY? with Home Alone. Ice Cube, looking older, with a slight paunch, fits the bill of domesticated Dad to a T now. Certainly, the sight gags on the one hand, and the kids' grudging acceptance of their stepfather, on the other, are retread ideas from the first film, but they work nearly as effectively in this sequel. A fun way to spend an hour and a half watching wholesome entertainment suitable for the entire family.

Think of it as Ice Cube's postcard from/promo for, Oregon!",1186617600,,533,4.610526315789474
2863990,3,B000RBA6BU,"ARE WE DONE YET? is both a sequel to the fairly successful 2005 comedy ARE WE THERE YET? and a remake of the classic Cary Grant film, MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE.  Both of those films are better than ARE WE DONE YET?, but overall the film isn't too bad.

In this movie Nick (Ice Cube) and Suzanne (Nia Long) are married and the entire family has moved into Nick's apartment.  Nick has sold his sports collectible shop and started a sports magazine.  The apartment is way too small for everyone, but space is even more of an issue when Suzanne notifies Nick that she's pregnant.  Nick and Suzanne have been house hunting, but it isn't until they meet realtor Chuck Mitchell, Jr. (John C. McGinley) and tour one of his homes in the country away from Portland that they agree that they've found the ideal home for their family.  The home needs some work initially seems fine and in working order.  But then the problems start.  Nick finds himself faced with one remodeling issue after another.  When he calls a contractor in to look things over and fix things up, he discovers that not only is Chuck the only local realtor, he's also the only local contractor.  More and more problems are discovered and the bills pile up as Nick struggles to find a balance between keeping his family together, starting his new magazine, and building a home.  As Nick discovers, when you're a homeowner the work is never done.

I had been pleasantly surprised by ARE WE DONE YET? and was curious how well the sequel would be.  Overall, the film isn't too bad.  It is formulaic in some parts and doesn't break any new ground.  However, as a sequel it works rather well.  Ice Cube might not be a comic genius, but his talent as a physical film comedian has grown enormously in the past few years.  The real comic value and much of the emotional depth of the film comes from John C. McGinley's portrayal of Chuck.  Chuck could have easily been portrayed as a jerk that somehow gets everyone in Nick's family to like him.  However, McGinley doesn't portray Chuck that way.  Instead, we get a man who is passionately devoted to his work and who even though can be annoying at times, is also extremely likeable.  I know that ARE WE DONE YET? will not have an initial appeal to a huge audience, but I would suggest watching the movie for McGinley's performance alone.  It's worth it.

Recommended for those who saw ARE WE THERE YET?, for those just looking for an average family comedy, and for anyone who is a fan of any of the cast members.",1177200000,,2525,4.501098901098901
