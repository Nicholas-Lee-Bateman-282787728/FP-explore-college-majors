8590410,2,B00006672H,"EXTENDED VERSIONS-THE DVD COLLECTION: A companion piece to the seemingly endless CD series, this concert variety package is for the ""classic rock"" diehard that's not overly concerned with original band lineups. Here's the breakdown...Lynyrd Skynyrd, as everybody knows, is only a semi-reasonable facsimile of late 'n great rebel rouser Ronnie Van Zant's original band, led by his less talented brother Johnny. REO Speedwagon still has Kevin Cronin on lead vocals, but his once radio-ready voice has eroded into an ultra-thin, nasally rasp on their ballad biggies here. Styx passes off a so-so Dennis DeYoung soundalike on LADY (J.Y. Young shoulda belted out MISS AMERICA instead), but at least Tommy Shaw renders his own TOO MUCH TIME ON MY HANDS with capable attitude. 38 Special's main belter Don Barnes gets his job done, although co-singer Donnie Van Zant (another Skynyrd-related brother) is mostly just a cheerleader for the band. George Thorogood and Eddie Money are who they say they are. If you're a fan of over-the-hill arena rock 'n roll...you know who you are...then by all means, flick that Bic and crank this up.

8590411,3,B00006672H,"I was very disappointed with this DVD.  Since the cover made no mention as to whether the videos were live or not, I assumed they were the music videos that used to play on MTV back in the early 80's. Unfortunately, these are all live videos. To make things worse, these are recent live videos.  I purchased this DVD specifically because of REO SpeedWagon and Styx.  Some of the band members are not the original members. Take Styx, for example. They have a different drummer (original one passed away), bass player, and keyboard player. As you may know, Dennis Deyoung was their original keyboard player, and more importantly, one of their lead singers.  The new guy plays the keyboard very well but does not compare vocally to Dennis Deyoung.  The videos are excellent quality, however.",1029715200,30,788,4.807407407407408
