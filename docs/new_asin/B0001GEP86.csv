8602263,4,B0001GEP86,"Sex comedies of the seventies can be an odd lot especially in the era of porn.  The Sex Machine (aka Love and Energy) (1975) is no exception.  It has no idea what kind of humor it's supposed to employ, it goes from cute and innocent to weirdly perverted, sometimes in the same scene.  The film takes place in the distant future where all fuel is spent and the entire planet is without electricity.  A scientist discovers a way to harness electricity from the kinetic energy of sex and changes the world. If you are a watcher of Italian cinema, you should already know that you may be in for a bit of a wild ride.  This is no exception, even though it does not stray far from its soft core innocence.  It has a childlike quality, starting out as silly and stupid, surviving the potential boredom just from its own corny nature.  But once the film starts to explore how sex is suddenly a social and moral obligation to restore power to the world, the film suddenly becomes almost a lighthearted take on Caligula with one perversion after another being thrown around with childlike glee. With Rome as a backdrop, it's completely appropriate.  As the implications kick in and sex becomes compulsory, even going as far as outlawing ""falling in love"", the film suddenly takes a creepy and dark turn.  This one is hard to find, but it is worth tracking down.  My wife chuckled at the parallel between this and The Matrix-like theme of turning humans into living batteries.",1392508800,3,1465,4.6
