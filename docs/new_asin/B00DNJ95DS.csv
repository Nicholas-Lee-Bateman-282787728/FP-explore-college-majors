5835657,4,B00DNJ95DS,"When I saw the title of the film, I really wondered if I should watch it or not. But, the positive reviews it received pushed me to give it a chance. And I'm glad I did! While the situation surrounding Ada's pregnancy is a tad uncomfortable, the whole situation isn't far-fetched nor are the characters. The actors, many of which I'd never heard of before, really did a wonderful job. Sean Young (the only one I had heard of) did quite the job of playing a mother I'd never wish to have. The ending was heartbreaking but didn't leave me crying foul. It's not a movie for everyone and not every horror fan will like it, but I definitely don't think this one is a dud.",1374883200,17,666,4.2936507936507935

5835659,5,B00DNJ95DS,"A very compelling, original and surprisingly powerful little backwoods-legend tale which is presented just as a good scary story should be and has meaning to it beyond the surface. Not a slasher film or big-budget fake, or like anything you have seen before except an Arch Oboler LIGHTS OUT show or maybe THE LOTTERY, but it's deeper and better than that; a very memorable little piece of horror-tragedy that will stick with you and make you think a little too. Fantastic performance by leading female Lauren Ashley Carter who does the wide-eyed OMG-something-bad-is-gonna-happen look better than anyone ever before and whom you believe in 100%. Twisted, yes, but not unfairly -- this is actually meaningful in its off-center, homespun frightfulness and highly discussable as well whether it intended to be or not. I really do admire projects that manage to still be a good show despite having been shot for a budget of peanuts and this is definitely such a thing. A great little movie which is scary on two levels at once -- visually and intellectually -- and therefore much better than the average horror film. Highest recommendation.",1374451200,4,1136,5.015873015873016

What an unusual story and it wasn't that far fetched. I'll bet there's some folk way up high in them moonshine makin' hills that made a pit the center of their world.

5835687,2,B00DNJ95DS,"I thought this movie was interesting and had a lot of potential, but ultimately it fell short for me. I really enjoyed watching the daily lives of strange backwoods hillbillies. They worship a magical mud pit that occasionally demands human sacrifices. Unfortunately, the script writer decided to make the mud pit truly magical (or supernatural, whatever). That's not a spoiler... it's revealed very early on. I would've preferred if that information was kept from the audience, letting US decide if it was real or not. Or, at least save that reveal for the very end. As it stands, the audience is now forced to dislike the main character, because she's scheduled for sacrifice (but her refusal to comply puts everyone around her in danger). She was perfectly willing to abide by the horrid 'lottery' system, until HER number was drawn... and then she decides to rebel. That's selfish and stupid. My other problem with the film is the main character's constant supernatural seizures (a punishment, inflicted by the mud pit). Every time she has one, the audio spikes exponentially, forcing me to crank the volume down ASAP. Near the end, I just wanted the movie to be over. Pity... it could've been good.",1505347200,2,1203,4.931034482758621

5835692,4,B00DNJ95DS,"Pay attention to the opening cartoon drawing sequences during the opening credits as it reveals what is going on in the community... or read this review. A pit cures people of illness, but also requires that people die from time to time. Their blood is sacrificed to the pit. The selection is determined by the community half-wit (Sean Bridgers) who is a potter. The pit channels the information to him and then he makes a jug with the face of the next victim. He goes into a black out phase and doesn't remember anything. Ada (Lauren Ashley Carter) secretly pregnant, discovers a jug with her face and for some reason doesn't want to die and hides the jug. The pit is angry and lashes out at the community.

The God=pit metaphor is well established when they use phrases like , ""the pit giveth and taketh away."" Instead of God taking people through various natural mechanisms, the pit has the community sacrifice seeming random people. While  human sacrifice films through lotteries etc. are common, I liked the unique way this is done. Would have been a great role for Jennifer Lawrence.

5835695,4,B00DNJ95DS,"This is what Indie horror can look like when done exceptionally.  Well scripted, paced at a nice slow build with a great payoff climax - it's actually better the second watch around because of the opening sequence, but I won't spoil it for you.  It has the feel of the old MN Shyamalan films without the crappy twist/fade off at the end - just pure character driven horror. Color palate and the squalid visuals of the setting feel visceral and real, constantly blurring the line between superstition and the truly paranormal.

While not a complete waste of film its close, will it become a cult classic, I don't think so.  I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what was going on, except for a hole in the ground with water in it blood wanting sacrifice.  Something will occur and its a while after that you get told the significance.  Ex the star steals a piece of pottery, looks at it and then buries it,  later on she moves it throwing it in the bushes, still later on you find out the reason.

5835705,2,B00DNJ95DS,"The story is a pretty original folk-legend styled story that has some questions, that manage to linger just far enough out of reach to warrant watching the whole movie, hoping for small morsels of information to let you know more about this clan of hillbillies. Why the hell were they out there anyway. How did the come to find the pit? History  s*** like that drove me to pay attention to this movies storyline. I was not rewarded in that aspect but during the course I was given moments of uncomfortable, cringing accents, twisted family dynamics and enough gory moments to make the discomfort acceptable. The pit and the fact that faces of sacrifices form on jugs is the biggest thing that I loved about this film-oh and the gore!

Jug Face runs a bit low in the adrenaline department instead flowing in a more melodramatic, lethargic wave of communal depression.  I didn't find anything connectable with too many of the characters and Sean Youngs character done more to irritate my viewing experience than accentuate it. So that was disappointing. However like I said-this story is pretty original and slightly outlandish enough to make anyone really want to watch it at least once! Dont expect much and if like me you are southern and from the hills- some elements may come off a little offensive or clich but over all Jug Face holds steady at a mildly entertaining WTH? sort of movie viewing experience.

I would have enjoyed if the movie had a little more detail about ""the pit"" in it but otherwise, good. Some of the big Hollywood films I have seen lately were bad compared to this. Dawai and Ada I fell in love with right way they both are great characters for the story and balanced the movie out. The actual ""jug faces"" in which Dawai created were a unique twist.

5835709,4,B00DNJ95DS,"I had super low expectations going into a movie with a title like ""Jug Face"", but I gotta say I was shockingly surprised at how much I ended up liking this.  Sean Bridgers is an absolutely amazing actor. To watch him play the role of the realistically ""slow"" older friend is amazing after seeing him play the cruel husband in Woman - what a difference! I also enjoyed Lauren Ashley Carter's performance, another vet from Woman. Both great actors that made this movie worthwhile. Hell, even Sean Young wasn't (too) awfully bad in this movie. She played the psychotic mother role well. Definitely a creative idea for a movie - backwoods folk following their own ""religion"" based around an angry pit in the ground, leading to deaths and murders for ""a cause"". However, I didn't understand a lot of the ghost scenes or why they were even necessary, since they didn't seem to help her out any.

So here goes.
The story here has great potential.  It starts off pretty good, but should have stayed in the psychological arena instead of becoming, what i call, too literal.  To me, it's a way better story if you don't see the 'creature', don't really know if there are 'ghosts', just that the characters believe in them. The psychology to me is so interesting, especially the idea of a backwoods isolated group of hillbillies.  But... the story lost its way somewhere after 20 minutes and just became too literal.  The story starts becoming secondary to all the anomalies and details that just don't fit in anymore.  But, it was interesting enough to watch the entire movie.

5835735,4,B00DNJ95DS,"I do not understand all the bad reviews.

For his first feature film, writer and directer Chad Crawford Kinkle has crafted a chilling, redneck-hick horror legend film in Jug Face. Ar 81 minutes, the log line on IMDB reads: Jug Face tells the story of a pregnant teen trying to escape a backwoods community when she discovers that she may be sacrificed to a creature in a pit.

The movie features Lauren Ashley Carter as Ada where close-knit families of moonshiners live to serve a pit deep in the woods. A potter creates jug with a face that resembles people within the community. The person ""featured"" must be sacrificed over an open, living pit filled with what looks like blood. A ghost-child is the speaker for the dead. When Ada discovers the newest made jug, it is her face depicted, her face looking back at her.

Although betrothed, Ada is pregnant with another's child. She does not want to be the next Jug Face sacrifice, so she steals and hides the potted jug. Her actions cause a disruption in order. The ghost-child is not happy, nor is the community as more and more people needlessly die. In an attempt to right wrongs and stop needless sacrifices, Ada and the potter try to fix all that went wrong.

This is a horror movie pure and simple. Frightening and gritty. It will not make you scream. Or jump. It will give you chills and perhaps have you sleep with the lights on.

The cast is made up of lesser known name actors and actresses that are talented and believable. Carter is an amazing Ada. If you are looking for a compelling tale, filled with blood and the stuff urban legends are made of, then I recommend Jug Face. I give it a 4 out of 5 Stars.

Good thing I was drinking coffee as I watched this or I would have passed out.
Wish there would have been some clue as to what that pit was all about. Where did it come from, when did it start, what the hell was it? etc.
The actor playing the quote/un-quote retarded guy couldn't quite pull it off. He simply acted ignorant, not retarded.
Why this was in the 'Horror' category/genre is beyond me. It was more like a drama with a tad bit of gore thrown in.
You did have a chance to get familiar with the characters. I felt sorry for the main character in the end.
Was the story line original for an independent film? Not quite. I've seen the same scenario with different story lines over and over. Maybe not a supernatural pit but a small village/town sacrificing their members or outsiders for one reason or another and it's usually for the survival or good of the villagers or so they get in a decent crop that year.

There are several back stories at work that will elude the causal horror fan.  These include the need for the society to control the girls womb and since she fails to abstain until after marriage the result is cataclysm for the entire village.  The prophet or ecclesiastic authority rests with the chosen potter who manufactures moonshine jugs with the likeness of townspeople as a means to identify the current threat to the peace and security of the village.  Once identified as such, they are expected to follow the rules of the society and accept their own murder as necessary and just.  The girl simply tries to avoid the capital punishment measured out to her for her transgression and in so doing invites the great wrath of the god and ultimately torture punishment and death.  Love does not conquer all. Each element of the story (moonshine jugs, invalid grandfather, etc) is well considered and symbolic. The acting is very good and believable.  The direction is well done.

Its a well done flick, no complaints in any department: visual, auditory, acting, direction, story, dialogue, etc. The meaning of it all is slowly unravelled, which kept it interesting. Like, what's with the jugs? And what's the pit about? The characters were rural, backwoods types. Not very well developed but its not that kind of movie. The pacing was fine. I didn't feel like it lagged. The reason why it doesn't score higher on my meter is because I really didn't care too much. It didn't hook me, let alone grip me.

The local city people don't know much about what goes on in the woods and they tend to ignore it. This is a story about a group of rednecks who look for salvation from a mud hole. The ""pit"" as it's called requires an occasional human sacrifice. It has the power to give the locals everything they need to survive and the power to take it all away. The pit knows exactly who the next sacrificial victim will be and it makes their faces known to the local ceramic potter, who sees them in his dreams before he makes a jug with each face. The girl at the beginning of the story finds a jug with her face and realizes that she's next. She hides her jug from the potter to prevent her own death and he's forced to makes another jug with a new face to replace the one he lost. This results in the wrong person being sacrificed and the potter is blamed for the wrongful death. The pit begins sacrificing others at random until the lost jug is found. The girl later learns that she's pregnant but has hidden this fact from everyone around her. Unknown to anyone else, the potter has also made another jug with a baby. The girl finds this jug and tells the potter it's her baby the pit wants. The potter and the girl attempt to escape before the pit takes revenge.

This movie is creepy and disturbing rather than frightening, and while I applaud the instinct of the fillmmakers in not stopping the action for scenes of pure exposition, a breadcrumb here or there to help us follow what the hell is going on would not have gone amiss. But having said that, maybe never understanding the nature of the menace, the qualities of the supernatural beings, or the exact ethos the characters found themselves in was part of what made it creepy. I really felt like I'd been plunked down among some odd folks with strange customs, and that was before the sacrifices to a deep mud puddle.

5835856,4,B00DNJ95DS,"Nine Things about Jug Face

1. This strange and macabre little film is hard to classify. I guess it would technically be called a horror film, but its also a domestic drama.

2. The movie is really low-budget, and the acting is uneven. But its a tight, well-paced, atmospheric indie film.

3. Its about a small group of backwoods families. They are ignorant, abusive, incestuous rednecks that live off of moonshine and roadkill.

4. They also worship some ancient thing that lives in a pit in the forest. It needs sacrifices.

5. One family member is a mentally slow young man gets messages from the pit about who is to be sacrificed next. A girl discovers shes been chosen, and tries to get out of it.

6. The pit isn't happy with the girls refusal, and starts retaliating against the families.

7. This could have been a really cheesy movie  its hard to explain the story with a straight face. But the script is very well done; it dares to play the story straight and you just go with it.

8. There is not a lot of violence, so when it does happen, it grabs your attention.

9. This movie could be considered a commentary on blind devotion, cults, and religion. Or else it could just be a warning to stay away from families that live in the woods.",1388880000,,1249,4.414847161572053
5835857,4,B00DNJ95DS,"Guilty because that is best characterized a horror film and we don't watch these anymore. As for the genre, this is one of the better films I've seen. All the typical elements are there - a young, not-so-innocent girl and her lover. A community that has adopted an obsessive reliance on sacrificial ritual. A ritual that has become stronger than any of them alone - or together. A forced marriage that the girl doesn't want. Beheadings and lots of blood mixed together with blood. But there are interesting twists and the ending is not what you'd expect. It's also not a gore-fest, as the sacrifices are simply carried out as the right thing to do. No one seems to take pleasure in them. The sex scene is just enough for you to know what is happening. In short, it's a horror film that tricks you and leaves you feeling uneasy, with no simple answers.

In time this film slowly but surely releases mega punches not shying away from gore genres. I will say medium on gore, this film is more of a why are they, how are they going to and what? It definitely will propose a question to many viewers. The pit, not to spoil this film is a place of healing it keeps many families well, yet many offerings must be given to keep order. The lead is a young woman who wills her way out of this pact, as she becomes pregnant, she is given a gift to see what appears to be a message from a different realm. As she sees visions, of what she cannot accept the abyss or for say pit summons up chaos turning the pacts of families against one another. For it was a sacred tradition for a jugs in the form of human faces to be formed as given to a messenger the second lead in this film. The acting in this film is incredible. the back drops will grasp a many, also one will find there self caught in mystery yet at the same time disturbed. 3 stars for being different, acting is great, the movie is very entertaining, it is a film that has more jumps that one would expect it didn't have to become incredibly goring to be disgusting in a way that reels one in wondering.. The ending well I will not give away, and also there was room for more surprises as well, as some development with where this pit came from and more development on what some may call the monster in the film. Grab it watch it, it is worth the watch you will not bore it will grab you. If you expect a 4 star hollywood blockbuster, and that is what you seek out this may not be for you, it appears to look very good but the budget for the film was low, nonetheless a break from the repetitive.. Oh grab your Girl guys if she screams easily she will with this one trust me I have been reviewing horror films for how long.

5835866,2,B00DNJ95DS,"""Jug Face"" sinks to such a low level that it makes it almost impossible to find ANY redeeming qualities about it.  I noticed a few reviewers have associated this movie with ""backwoods hillbillies.""  I beg to differ, as this movie gives backwood hillbillies a bad name.

Supposedly a look into the lives of a long-forgotten clan, ""Jug Face"" doesn't do anything that is morally right:  incest (that's the FIRST scene), using a cigarette to ""coax"" the truth out of your daughter while she sits on the toilet, constant face slapping of the daughter by the mother, and a hole (a/ka/ ""the pit"") that doles out justice (I guess) backwoods style.  Nothing is ever explained; e.g. how about a little backstory on how the potter is chosen, did this girl have some kind of powers or was she just possessed whenever the time was convenient?  Why didn't she just run away?

The biggest problem I had with this movie was the script--it was just not cohesive at all and it gave you characters you really didn't care about or know enough  to care about.  Rated R for some gore, nudity, and incest, I cannot recommend this one.",1388016000,,1110,4.622448979591836

3) Bad accents. They are only hillbillies with certain vowels, and never when crying or yelling.
4) Overzealous hair and makeup team. The heroin is a porcelain doll, who comes up clean even after a romp in the mud with her brother.
5) No payoff. I only know it ended because credits started rolling- And I thought irony was the Hipsters' thing. None here, unless you expect to be entertained.

All in all, it was like some 1st year SAG team's Melrose blackbox ejaculation- A bunch of kids trying to shock you with as many cliches as they can squeeze out of their Netflix (Instant-only) educations.

Thematically, it really conveys all the wrong messages and you spend the entire movie just hoping that the people in the village develop the courage/common sense to challenge the demon that demands these sacrifices. Or, you know, MOVE AWAY en masse. Or even to have the thought that either of those options are swell ideas.

Lets not forget about the worst southern stereotyping since Deliverance. Once again, actors who are clearly not southern don their best down home accents (which are quite horrible at times) to portray rural life as incest-riddled, misogynistic,  and primitive. There are a few performances that truly stand out, but they are concealed by a plot that starts strong but never delivers.

Backwoods life for a group of families centers around The Pit which demands sacrifice and offers care in return. It's honestly hard to tell if The Pit took control over these families in service of itself or if they gave The Pit the power to wield over them.

5835928,2,B00DNJ95DS,"I struggled with whether to give this movie 2 or 3 stars because unlike other reviewers, I thought the acting was quite good.  Instead, I thought it was the tone that was off, and theres also the problem of the movie never committing to what it wants to be.  While I was watching it, I felt that there was something very M. Knight Shyamalans The Village about it, and kept on expecting some twist that would explain all of the oddness onscreen.  But ultimately, what I was seeing was what I was getting -- and it was kind of a gratuitous mess -- which is why I went with 2 stars.

The main character, Ada, is a teenage girl who lives in a backwoods community with her family and other families who worship a pit, which is literally a mud hole the likes of which is created when a giant tree is uprooted.  The pit demands human sacrifices and in exchange, safeguards the people in the community from other tragedies, like fatal disease.  The pit channels its demands through the hands of a potter who, in a trance-like state, crafts jugs in the image of the individual whom the pit wants next -- hence the term Jug Face.  Despite the fact that any of them could be rendered unto the pit at any moment, the members of the community seem pretty content with this arrangement.

Except for Ada.  When she has a premonition that she is next, she sneaks a peak at the potters latest jug, confirms her fears, and unprepared to die, hides it in the woods.  The pit is angered and a bloodbath ensues.  The gore in the movie is pretty gory, between the human sacrifices and people being torn to shreds by the angry pit.  I would categorize the movie as more violent than scary.

There are elements of the horror genre in the movie -- perhaps too many elements, and they never gel.  Theres a cult aspect.  Theres the human sacrifice aspect, which very much reminds me of the famous short story The Lottery.  Theres a witch hunt aspect.  And then for something completely different, theres a strange Wizard of Oz aspect surrounding Adas burgeoning womanhood and her struggle with making her home in a world that has so little to offer her.

Then there are the anachronisms.  Adas community has cars and refrigerators, but they wash their clothes in a creek and wear the same outfits every day, most of which couldve been taken off the set of Little House on the Prairie.  They make their living selling moonshine which they store in more handmade jugs.  The juxtaposition of the backwards, backwoods community and the modern town just outside of it serves to create a creepy, isolated atmosphere, but theres no explanation for how or why these people exist in this situation.  Theres some barely coherent background given through the character of Adas grandfather, who is senile and mute, but its not enough to support why these people live the way they do, other than the fact that they keep stating its worked well for them for a while.  But how has it worked?  Not only does it seem that the community isn't large enough to perpetuate itself, why isn't child protective services poking around asking why the kids aren't in school?  How is the disappearance of so many individuals by sacrifice overlooked by the mainstream authorities?  Its not like this is a secret community  although its drawn to seem like one, and it just doesnt work.

At its core, the story revolves around whether Ada will escape and allow everyone to die, or make up for her betrayal.  She also needs to deal with the fact that shes pregnant -- the excuse she uses for not wanting to die.  And the fact that she is promised to be joined to men in the community (another ridiculously old-fashioned trope), contingent upon her purity.  There are graphic scenes involving incest and sexuality in the movie; it is for adults only.

Again, I appreciated the acting, including Sean Young as Adas mother, but there is no pay-off.  The movie goes nowhere.  Instead, it left me searching for some deeper meaning that I cant find.",1384560000,,3984,4.588401697312588

I enjoyed this movie so much that I will be researching the writers, directors and actors to seek out more of their work.

Other reviews have said that this is not a horror movie. If you think a horror movie is just gore and body count, then maybe it is not. I think of a horror movie as one that scares me, fills me with that sense of dread and that is executed in a way that it is believable.

I would compare this movie to the movie ""The Gift"".

Personally, I think Amazon should have a 6 star rating, just for movies of this caliber.",1383436800,,1101,4.283653846153846

We recommend that you see this film.  You will either like it, as we did, or, if you do not understand mountain ways, you may hate it.

We'd have liked to learn more about The Pit and the creature who was connected to it.

The mountain accents and speech patterns were very good, with occasional slips noticeable only to those of us who are native to the Smokies and nearby places. We mountain people do not have much respect for standard Hollywood films featuring badly done and almost insulting dialect.",1383004800,,797,4.506944444444445
5835987,3,B00DNJ95DS,"I thought this film had a rather original storyline, since I don't recall many modern films with a sacrificial element that didn't also tie into something historical or classically mythological. I enjoyed how the film wasn't a straight horror film, but instead tied in family drama and suspense, though I felt that there was a little too much left up to the imagination. The story and the aura of the pit should have been fleshed out more from the very beginning, perhaps in some kind of narrative prologue. As another reviewer mentioned, it is quite strange to think that people would willingly sacrifice themselves to this tiny pit in the ground. This pit needed its own history and mythology to be introduced to the viewers, so it would be easier to suspend our disbelief that these sacrifices were actually going on. As a viewer, I felt as if I was thrust right into the middle of a cultural documentary and just left to tie loose ends by myself. Of course, it would have been cliche to sensationalize the back story too much as well, so middle ground would be needed.

The characterization of backwoods people here was stereotypical and overkill with the incest involved. In a film that seemed to rely more on subtlety and insinuation, it's odd to have such a shocking revelation, especially when that particular detail is inconsequential or unexplained as to the relevance of it.

Overall, it's an entertaining and intriguing film, but the atmosphere and pacing portrayed it almost as an episode in a series, rather than an event that is all newly unfolding for the viewer.",1382918400,,1579,4.801470588235294

It was directed by Chad Kinkle, whom I've never heard of before. He did a very good job of making this movie flow. I look forward to seeing more movies made by Mr Kinkle in the near future.
  The characters, dialogue, and scenery are all nicely captured. (It was filmed entirely in the beautiful backwoods of Tennessee) Another thing that really stood out for me were the jugs made for this film. They are creepy & seem almost lifelike. You'll see what I'm talking about later.
  I would recommend going into this movie knowing nothing about the plot or what to expect. That's what I did and it was a nice surprise.

5836089,5,B00DNJ95DS,"and so does the movie viewer!

We were looking through a list of movies available On Demand on our TV. We watched, oh, I don't know, perhaps a dozen previews. They all seemed to be a conflagulation of every other movie in that genre that came before it. Like just a really bad knock off. I'm sure those movies would have been just fine, but just as easily forgettable and predictable.

Then we saw the preview for Jug Face.

And so it appeared we had not only found a movie sure to entertain us with messed-up characters, but we also found something unique. Something we hadn't felt as though we'd seen a thousand times before.

The paranormal element was so beautifully handled that for the first part of the story I wasn't sure if the pit TRULY wielded any power, or if these people were just crazy! (Or both!) You'll have to see the movie for yourself to find out.

Chad C Kinkle really captured the spirit of paranormal horror in its finest form. (That's not to say Jug Face is without its share of gore, but it was `earned', not there for the hell of it, and not there to make up for a flailing plotline.) The building of suspense, the wondering where it would all lead to, I mean, really, not only was this entertaining, but it was also deliciously classic and one-of-a-kind all at the same time.

The cast of this film certainly deserves credit for their exceptional ability to bring this story to life. I was impressed with how genuine it was--not something I think could have been achieved with a Brad Pitt kinda cast. Jug Face is one of those movies that you don't even think, until you're done watching it, ""Oh hey, this is a movie. The people are acting."" I was completed invested.

By far the best horror movie I've seen in a long, long time.",1378512000,59,1755,4.414860681114551
5836090,5,B00DNJ95DS,"Jug Face is the kind of horror film that I would love to see more of, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. Is it perfect? No. But what it does ""wrong"" makes room for what it does right, and what it does right is, frankly, spellbinding. For instance, it's about 20 minutes into the film before we get our first real scare, but in that time we're introduced to the main characters with a level of depth and observation that is unusual in horror movies.

The story is essentially a feature length version of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery-- a rural community in southern Appalachia participates in a strange sacrifice ritual to maintain the status quo. In this case people have their throats cut above a shallow pit out in the woods. Then one day, after a young woman of the village learns that she is next in line to be sacrificed, she hides the Jug Face (a kind of spiritual object which foreshadows her death) to try and save herself. However, in the world of the film, death can't be escaped, merely postponed, and several others must die as the pit tries to reclaim her. There's also a subplot involving the girl's incestuous relationship with her brother, which is sad, uncomfortable, and does a nice job of illustrating her disconnectedness from the real world.

Similar to The Lottery, the script is tough, literate and allegorical. But again, the true success here is less the plot, and more the characters, who are written and performed with a level of complexity and nuance that is usual for the genre.

Long story short: Jug Face certainly isn't for everyone, not even for all horror fans. People who enjoy a new kill every 10 minutes, ala The Saw films, will almost definitely be disappointed. However, for fans of slow-burn/character-driven horror (films like The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, The Other, House Of The Devil, and Martha Marcy May Marlene all spring to mind) Jug Face will likely be a deeply rewarding experience.",1376524800,2,1933,4.71301775147929

5836092,2,B00DNJ95DS,"Jug Face follows the story of a young pregnant girl (Ada), who is trying to escape the clutches of her isolated community. A community set in the middle of the woods, where their lives are guided by the supernatural presence of a pit. Ada discovers that she is the next sacrifice and must escape before it is too late.

A supernatural horror of the control and dictatorship a pit has over a small isolated community. To please the pit they must make human sacrifices of whoever the pit requires. Those chosen are communicated through the possession of Dawai, who creates the face of the next sacrifice onto a jug (hence the masterful title). The authenticity of the mystical pit is not the centre of this story, but instead the results created by an evil force left free to reign over a helpless community.

Although the story sounds weak the director initially manages to create a film with potential; nostalgic of the cult and extremist films of the 70's. The style of filming is pretty generic as it seems that the director has no focus on what the film is trying to say, so the camera keeps distance favouring long and medium shots, allowing the story to unfold freely within the frame. Close ups and rapid editing is used in moments of 'white eyed' possession...

Jug Face can be described as a drama more than a horror, there are graphic scenes of sacrifices with entrails and body parts to keep the gore hunters happy, but the film exhausts the plight that Ada faces and the inescapable fate of those chosen by the pit. Jug Face explores a plain and raw view of life, death, sex and the primitive values within this tight knit community; where girls are tested as virgins, and whipped if they go against community rules.

Equality is dead...get your jugs out for the pit...

5836094,3,B00DNJ95DS,"I really liked this movie, it was better than I anticipated and worth the money I spent. Amazon recommended this to me and honestly it took me a couple of weeks before I actually bought it. The plot is good, the story is original but it would have been nice to have the ""back story"" start in the beginning of the movie instead of given to us in pieces throughout the movie.",1375574400,3,373,4.194444444444445
5836095,2,B00DNJ95DS,"The best part about this movie was the great acting from Laura Ashley Carter and Sean Bridgers. Other than that, the plot felt flat and it did not really deliver in any way to my expectation of being scared, surprised, etc.",1375574400,,223,4.463414634146342

The only thing this movie has going for it is the incestuous relation between bro and sis, and that is one 2 min scene. the people who gave this movie more than 2 stars are seeing stars themselves.",1374969600,,352,4.253731343283582

8594940,4,B00DNJ95DS,"Jug Face is a very well crafted hidden gem. Its haunting and genuine. The plotline has a richness of originality. The horror lies in the often unseen and in the sheer wilful worship and ignorance of man.
A ravenous, deadly belief that is built among a society who truly believes what they are doing is right. The horror of single mindedness that empowers these people to commit horrific acts.
I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a slow burning horror that will leave with you a lasting feeling of dread and melancholy",1521417600,,525,4.655913978494624

Despite this,  it was definitely worth the watch.",1506556800,,332,4.576271186440678
