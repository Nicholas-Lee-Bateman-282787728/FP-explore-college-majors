8064925,5,B0009PULMI,Amazing.  First saw Reksio on a trip to Poland this summer and my grandson and I fell in love with him!  More cartoonists should take a lesson from this one.,1407110400,,157,4.2
8064926,4,B0009PULMI,"This DVD contains seven short episodes of the reportedly-popular Polish series Reksio.  The animation is uncomplicated and effective (I loved the hand-painted backgrounds - sort of a Bill Melendez, Peanuts special feel to them) and the stories, centering around a brave do-gooder pooch, are heartening.  They may not hold the attention of most children in the U.S., but these short episodes are certainly positive and sincere.  This is just good cartooning for young children - take that for what it's worth to you and your family.  Oh, and don't worry about a language barrier; these films are without any spoken dialogue.  Enjoy!",1136764800,4,631,5.147058823529412
