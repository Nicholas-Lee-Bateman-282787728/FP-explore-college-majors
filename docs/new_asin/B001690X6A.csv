3154468,3,B001690X6A,"i like them but this dvd is just the movies no extras which i miss.
i would have prefered a double sided dvd with all the extras of the new line platinum series. deleted scenes, featurettes, commentary etc..

i am going to get low priced originals just for the extras. (and to think i had them both before i lost them in a move - argh).",1306195200,2,336,4.090909090909091
3154469,4,B001690X6A,I personally prefer the original Mask but I got this for The Son Of The Mask.  My kids love the baby in the second movie.  We've watched it about 20 times over the last week.  The baby's cute but I think I've seen enough. lol.,1295136000,,226,3.977777777777778
3154470,3,B001690X6A,This is a two parter... The Mask was a pretty good motion picture. It was Jim Carrey's movie career breakout and also introduced Carmen Diaz to the big screen. It has great special effects and is a very lively and fun romp. The Son of the Mask is another matter. No big names; same special effects and pretty predictable storyline. Buy this one for the original Mask. The sequel is not nearly as good.,1294876800,,401,4.4324324324324325

3154487,5,B001690X6A,"I really love rewatching movies I watched as a kid, the novelty of reliving childhood memories is nostalgic. This came out in 1994 and for its time was an impressive cinematic adventure. Watching back there were a few inappropriate jokes I definitely did not understand as a kid, interesting how our minds are polluted as we age. This doube feature came out on the amazon market in mid 2009 at $9 and has since dropped to below $5. It is a good buy under $5 since it's an old movie with a double feature but I wouldnt have bought it if it was more than $5.",1469923200,,556,4.254716981132075

3154520,4,B001690X6A,"The Mask: In Edge City, nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, Jim Carrey, gets sssmokin' when he wears the mask of Loki which releases the id that is normally suppressed. Cameron Diaz is in this film and Ben Stein plays Dr. Neuman who has coincidentally written a metaphorical book titled The Masks We Wear. I think Jim Carrey is funny.

Son of the Mask:  Beyond Edge City is Fringe City. Ben Stein is the only recurring actor in the sequel. It is like a nonanimated cartoon. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard ,of Monk, are a couple who have a son that was conceived while he was wearing the mask. Alan Cummings is Loki who is searching for his mask. This movie is more enjoyable if you can latch onto the sweetness of the family and overlook a few cinematic details.",1343174400,,753,4.449275362318841

3154522,4,B001690X6A,"If you like Jim Carrey then this is the movie for you. It's action filled with fun, laughs and toe tapping music. Stanley, played by Carrey, finds a magical mask that turns him into a character unlike himself. This includes his dog.  The second movie 'Son of the Mask' is surprisingly fun to watch. This time Loki, some ancient god of mischief, comes in search of his Mask and that's when the fun begins.",1318291200,,404,4.45945945945946

3389011,5,B001690X6A,I loved the mask with Jim Carey. The Mask 2 was just a bonus. I bought this movie for my kids 10 days ago and it hasn't come out of my daughters DVD player since the first night. My son and daughter say its one of the best movies that they have seen in a while and they are movie buffs.,1363651200,3,286,3.7049180327868854

3389017,4,B001690X6A,"The Mask: In Edge City, nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, Jim Carrey, gets sssmokin' when he wears the mask of Loki which releases the id that is normally suppressed. Cameron Diaz is in this film and Ben Stein plays Dr. Neuman who has coincidentally written a metaphorical book titled The Masks We Wear. I think Jim Carrey is funny.

Son of the Mask:  Beyond Edge City is Fringe City. Ben Stein is the only recurring actor in the sequel. It is like a nonanimated cartoon. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard ,of Monk, are a couple who have a son that was conceived while he was wearing the mask. Alan Cummings is Loki who is searching for his mask. This movie is more enjoyable if you can latch onto the sweetness of the family and overlook a few cinematic details.",1343174400,,753,4.449275362318841

3389019,4,B001690X6A,"If you like Jim Carrey then this is the movie for you. It's action filled with fun, laughs and toe tapping music. Stanley, played by Carrey, finds a magical mask that turns him into a character unlike himself. This includes his dog.  The second movie 'Son of the Mask' is surprisingly fun to watch. This time Loki, some ancient god of mischief, comes in search of his Mask and that's when the fun begins.",1318291200,,404,4.45945945945946

If you research ""Son of the Mask"", you will find that it totally bombed in theaters. Horrid movie. I would recommend only purchasing the original Mask movie.
