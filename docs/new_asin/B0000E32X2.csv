1932212,4,B0000E32X2,"I was unsure of how the video transfer to DVD would be for a 20 year old TV show.  I was surprised to find that it has only a slight amount of graininess and little or no detectable video noise!  Some episodes are better than others, but I found the video quality to be quite good.  Certainly the picture is much better than what I see on my cable signal.  The audio, Dolby Digital 2.0, is acceptable for a sit-com.  The voices are understandable with only occasional distortion.  The audio sounded a little flat at times.
""The Guys Behind the Bar"" discusses Season 2 in general.  I didn't find it to be very interesting and I probably won't watch it again.  ""Cliff's Notes"", ""Carla The Comeback Queen"", ""Di Another Day"" do not contain new footage.  Instead, they showed clips from several episodes that show off the named actor/actress.  They were nicely done.  The bloopers segment was laugh out loud funny, although it was short.  The extras are not a reason to buy the DVD set, in my opinion.
I like Shelley Long and Season 2 has several episodes about the on-off relationship between her and Ted Danson.  Many episodes are very funny.  I liked the episode ""Just Three Friends"".  Markie Post plays Diane's friend who is attracted to Ted Danson!  ""Cheers"" does a good job of portraying everyday conflicts, and the fact that it is set in a bar becomes unimportant.
Here are the episodes, with a tiny description:
1. Power Play (Diane & Sam together? You gotta be kidding!)
2. Little Sister Don't Cha (Carla plays her own sister)
3. Personal Business (Can Diane get another job?)
4. Homicidal Ham (Diane's blind date)
5. Sumner's Return (The return of Diane's former fiance)
6. Affairs of the Heart (A man is interested in Carla)
7. Old Flames (Can he break up Diane & Sam?) This episode won 2 Emmys.
8. Manager Coach (Coach coaches a Little League team)
9. They Called Me Mayday (Writing Sam's autobiography)
10. How Do I Love Thee, Let Me Call You Back (Sam says ""I love you"")
11. Just Three Friends (Markie Post likes Sam)
12. Where There's a Will (A dying man tends bar)
13. Battle of the Exes (Carla's ex shows up)
14. No Help Wanted (Sam could get a BIG income tax refund)
15. And Coachie Makes Three (Diane and Sam want to be alone)
16. Cliff's Rocky Moment (Cliff gets into it with another patron)
17. Fortune and Men's Weight (A fortune-telling scale)
18. Snow Job (Sam lies to Diane)
19. Coach Buries a Grudge (I have to say nice things about WHO?"")
20. Norman's Conquest (Norman's romantic interest)
21. & 22 I'll Be Seeing You (Part 1 & Part 2) (An artist paints Diane)",1073606400,26,2582,4.532327586206897
1932213,4,B0000E32X2,"A wonderful classic show. It's hard to believe that the second season first aired on television over 20 years ago!  God, are we really getting that old?
The condition of the episodes on these DVDs is amazing.  The film transfer is sharp and the colors are vibrant.  Last week I was channel surfing and came across an episode from the first season.  The colors looked horrible, so I decided to pull out the DVD and play it at the same time so I could switch back and forth to compare.  What an amazing difference!  Like night and day.  It's great to have this show immortalized on DVD in such fantastic condition.  The second season's film quality is just as good.
Hopefully, with the continuing success of these DVD sets, we'll get some cast/crew commentaries for future seasons.
My only gripe about the second season set is the horrible box cover art.  As a magazine art director, I am amazed that the creative team at Paramount signed off on the fuzzy, murky images that grace the box cover.  Very unprofessional looking.",1073520000,4,1023,4.633333333333334
1932214,5,B0000E32X2,"I was counting the days until the second season of ""Cheers"" was released, and I was not disappointed. Not by the DVD itself, anyway. I noticed that Amazon raised their price by a few dollars between pre-order and release date. In the end, I bought the set for much less at Target. Just a word to the wise.
On to the DVD itself...""Cheers"" really hits its stride in the second season, with the beginning of the Sam & Diane relationship we all watched with amusement, interest, and amazement back in the day. The extras are slightly more substantial this time, too; while they all feature scenes from only the second season, we have ""Diane Chambers from A to Z,"" ""Carla's Insults for Every Occasion,"" ""Cliff's Notes of Wisdom,"" and ""Strictly Top Shelf: The Guys Behind the Bar,"" which includes both new and 1983 interviews with Jim Burrows, Ted Danson, George Wendt, and Rhea Perlman. I was a little disappointed no one even mentioned the late Nicholas Colasanto (Coach) and what it was like to work with him.
I'm hoping future ""Cheers"" DVD releases have a big, meaty documentary about the show, along the lines of the ""E! True Hollywood Story."" Don't get me wrong, I love the episodes themselves, but part of the fun of a DVD is the potential for lots of behind the scenes goodness.",1073433600,8,1280,4.643171806167401
1932215,5,B0000E32X2,"I'm so glad the next season is being released! Hopefully they'll continue to release the whole series because Cheers is the best! I 'm going to buy this the day it comes out, and I've rated it 5 stars even though it hasn't even come out yet because I'm confident that it will be excellent!",1073088000,,289,4.2727272727272725
1932216,5,B0000E32X2,"I am a huge fan of cheers, and nothing makes me happier than to finally see that Paramount will continue releasing Cheers on DVD.
The special features appear to be bigger and better in Season two, and this collection is a treat to any Cheers fan because some of the best episodes of the series were from season two. Sam and Diane's relationship took off, and look for the reactons of the other regulars...to quote Norm Peterson ""I miss the good old days when they threw up at the sight of eachother""
Season is gets 5 stars becasuse of brilliant writting, and the exceptionally talented acting.",1068854400,5,593,4.60377358490566
1932217,5,B0000E32X2,"This season showcases what is probably the best chemestry ever broadcast.
The acting and writing is some of the finest to grace the airwaves. Diane as played brilliantly by Shelly Long is a real treat.
The show is a wonderful depiction of a diverse group of customers and employees that come together in something of a surrogate family in a boston bar.
 This portion of the series also functions as a great romantic comedy fueled by stellar chemistry between Diane and Sam as polar opposites that attract. Very sharp humor and great dialogue punctuate the series. One of the best television shows of all time. These shows are highly repeatable and worth owning.",1067990400,6,661,4.849557522123894
1932218,5,B0000E32X2,"I think that Cheers is one of the top 2 or 3 sitcoms of all time.  I loved the first season, and I love every other season, but I think that the second season is the best.  The storylines are great, the characters are well defined, and the sexual tension between Sam and Diane is one that has never been matched in television history.  It is the best season of a great show, and I can't wait to own it.",1065571200,4,402,4.0

""You Wanna Go Where People Know Everybody Is All The Same"" as in drunk and disorderly appears to be the purpose of that absurdity.

1932875,5,B0000E32X2,"In the 1980s, Cheers became a hit after a slow start in the sitcom world. Cheers barely survived first season but the critics and networks noticed high quality. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. The ensemble became stars in their own right. The story of Sam Malone and Diane Chambers ranks as one of the best loved onscreen romances with their love and hate relationship. Ted Danson and Shelley Long were perfect in their roles and engrossed audiences as well.

The supportive cast includes Rhea Perlman (Taxi) as Carla, the barmaid and divorced mother of five children; John Ratzenberger as the know it all Cliff Clavin; George Wendt as Norm, the unemployed accountant; and Coach (played by the late wonderful Nicholas Colasanto) who died during the series. Guest stars include Dick Cavett, Night Court's Harry Anderson and Markie Post, Hunter's Fred Dryer, Christopher Lloyd, and George Gaynes.

The four discs include all twenty two episodes. Special features include ""Strictly Top Shelf: The Guys Behind The Bar"" featuring 1983 interviews with the creators, Ted Danson, and Shelley Long from Entertainment Tonight; ""Cliff's Notes: The Wisdom of Cliff Clavin;"" ""Carla The Comeback Queen: Insults For Every Occasion;"" ""Di Another Day: Diane Chambers from A to Z;"" and ""Gag Reel: Bloopers from Season 2.""",1451347200,,1316,5.173708920187793

1932959,5,B0000E32X2,"Season two of 'Cheers' is generally considered the most 'boring' one because it hinges on the friction between primitive bartender Sam and overly-cerebral waitress Diane's actual relationship rather than their 'Will they or won't they?' pre-sex (season 1) tension or their 'Will they or won't they ever again?' post-sex tension (season 3), however, this is my favorite season.

The season opens with Sam and Diane having finally consummated their long insult-laden flirtation. Tragically, the two have absolutely nothing going for them except magnetic sexual attraction - however, up until three quarters of the way through the season, they valiantly complete long stretches where they are civil to each other - primarily because Sam manages to tamp down his womanizing ways and Diane manages to shrug off his egregiously promiscuous past.

They still get in their barbs - Diane simply can't resist any opportunity to poke fun of Sam's lack of intellect - but on the whole there's a touching sweetness about their interactions. Watch for the episode where Sam pretends a relative has died so he can have a ski weekend alone with his buddies - but his strong feelings for his new girlfriend keep pulling him back to the bar despite desperately wanting not to appear 'whipped.' Or the one where he spends a painful and sleepless five days slogging through 'War and Peace' so he can fit in with her crowd.

Having their relationship settled for the time being means the writers begin to focus on the other members of the cast, who start to have bigger storylines. The season particularly lets Ernie 'Coach' Pantuso shine (I've always found him more appealing than his younger replacement, Woody Harrelson). Cliff becomes a welcome steady character. And it's the first the audience sees of Al, an addled old man who sits at the back of the bar and occasionally calls out something bizarre.

Toward the end of the season, the writers realized there was little left to mine in the Sam-and-Diane-are-dating dynamic (and as I recall, ratings started to fall) so they had to be broken up. Sam begins exhibiting abhorrently bad boyfriend behavior (he flagrantly flirts with Diane's best friend; refuses to get rid of his 'little black book' of sluts; and allows himself to be profiled as one of 'Boston's most eligible bachelors' in a magazine).

Additionally, Diane stubbornly continues to play Pygmalion with Sam, refusing to accept that he'll never be the art-and-literature-loving and emotionally-sensitive intellect she needs (she will meet that man, Frasier Crane, in the next season).

Eventually, the stark differences in their personalities come to an explosive head when Diane poses for a tortured artist (brilliantly played by Taxi's Christopher Lloyd) against Sam's wishes. Their break-up - complete with nose twisting - is about as undignified, yet as hilarious, as it comes.

The quality of the jokes in this season are as high as season one - the actors are a bit more settled into their characters - and there's the additional layer of true depth of feeling that pokes out from behind the perpetually juvenile war of wills between Sam and Diane.

For me, the show reaches its peak in season two.",1446940800,,3201,5.03780718336484

1933236,5,B0000E32X2,"Sam and Diane were a great crazy, wild, passionate couple and they were a lot of fun to watch.
My favorite couple in a drama is JR and Sue Ellen in original Dallas.
And although these couples are quite different as well as the characters. They have one major theme in common; they have PASSION!
This is the season that Sam and Diane get together and stay together the whole season. And all the hilarity that ensues.
These earlier seasons of Cheers are very different from the Rebecca years which is mostly one liners and less story based.
I enjoy all of Cheers but the Diane years are very different from the Rebecca years. Both funny but almost like 2 different shows because of the different directing, writing and acting styles by the same very talented people which is why it stayed on the air for 11 seasons.
The picture quality is great and I chose the SD version and just stretched out the picture on my HDTV. The sound is really good as well. Other streaming Providers have Cheers but the picture and sound are not good plus I want to watch it whenever I want.",1416355200,,1068,4.426395939086294

Coach is the loveable goof, Sam the ""reformed"" playboy major league relief pitcher, Diane his ditzy, albeit smart, girlfriend, Carla the girl who wants to rip the face off any given male and the barflies, Norm and Cliff.

This cast is one of the reasons and times an ensemble cast works.  While Sam (Ted Danzen) may be the ""lead"", no one person is really that more important than another.  In this instance, it's much like M*A*S*H.  Everybody had an important role within the program.

It's really hard not to like Cheers.  The storylines are fairly tame, the witty repartee, safe.  It's just all around good fun.",1401235200,,674,4.700854700854701

humor and the insanity that goes along with the zany plots that capture your attention.
Norm, a character who sits in the bar drinking a lot , I mean a lot, is not much of a figure to admire, but he and his buddy seem to represent the underdogs and the downtrodden. Carla, a barmaid,  is the fighter and survivor.
But although this sounds more like a drag than a ""wanna watch"", the show is bright and sunny and the two main figures, Sam and Diane, are excellent at their craft and make you want to see more of their lives as soon as you finish one episode.",1393372800,,675,4.075187969924812

Having had cable for many years and being increasingly disappointed by repetitive lack of quality programs; I discontinued the service and now have a large collection of my favorite shows.  Cheers tops my list.  Like the song says ""sometimes you just want to be where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came""  I believe If everyone had such a place this would be a much happier world.  Cheers with Ted and Shelley is one of my very favorites.  Their characters are completely like day and night which present more obstacles than most people have the fortitude of heart to endure in a love affair....yet somehow they run the race and jump the personality hurdles with the wind of unconditional acceptance under their wings,and win the trophy of true love.  I love the mix of Cliff, Carla, Norm & Coach also ...all of them together in their sort of surrogate family made a lovely representation of what family life today is missing...unconditional acceptance and support.  Ted and Shelley made me feel like they really were not acting...through all their defences there were sparks flying from the moment Shelley walked in the door of Cheers...and in the end Love made the ultimate bitter-sweet sacrifice.",1383350400,,1270,4.879069767441861

1933715,5,B0000E32X2,"During an interview found in the extras section of the DVD set, George Wendt explains that Cheers owes its life to a network executive who decided that they would show quality TV until the audience found it. Which is a good policy, given that most shows don't find their footing until their second season. Not to mention that in today's market, the show's first season, which topped out at number 13, would have likely seen them canned before a second season could begin.

By season two, Cheers knows exactly what it is. The characters have had their final tweaks, the relationships all laid out, and while the focus is on the love-hate relationship between Sam and Diane, the entire cast gets to shine, repeatedly. Stand outs include Rhea Perlman playing Carla's sex-fiend sister and Cliff standing up to a bar bully by displaying kung-fu skills he doesn't actually have. Round it out with a freaky fortune telling carnival scale and the appearances of Christopher Lloyd as a super-pretentious artist and Dan Hedaya as Carl's super-sleaze of an ex-husband, and this is the season where Cheers really takes off.

If only you could own a copy of it for yourself. Oh wait, you can  :)

EXTRA FEATURES =

Strictly Top-Shelf: The Guys Behind the Bar (9:30 min.)

Largely culled from old Entertainment Tonight interview footage (from 1983!), the feature has Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Les Charles, Glen Charles, and James Burrow, talking specifically about the second season. To fill that out, contemporary footage with Ted Danson, George Wendt, and Rhea Perlman provides an interesting retrospective contrast. While mostly of interest to the big fans, the fact that Paramount went to the trouble to dig up twenty-year-old ET footage should be applauded.

That, and George Wendt explaining how several years of over-the-shoulder shots past him at Ted Danson has made it so that even today fans can recognize him from behind, is hilarious.

Cliff's Notes: The Wisdom of Cliff Clavin (4:00 min)

Similar to the compilation of Cliff-isms in the first season set, this one is peppered with some interview footage of George Wendt talking about working with John Ratzenberger. Not as much as one might like, but a nice garnish just the same.

Carla The Comeback Queen: Insults for Every Occasion (3:30)

Here it is a wacky compilation of Carla-isms. Which is good, as season two was a stellar season for Carla. Again, the recent interview footage found in the first featurette, in this case Ted Danson, is put in to add a little commentary to the collection of verbal hate!

Di Another Day: Diane Chambers from A-Z (3:35)

Ted Danson returns to kick off the last character scene compilation.

Gag Reel: Bloopers From Season 2 (4:24)

Oh, if only they'd done one for Season One. But I'm not picky. I'll take what I can get. In this case, you get almost five minutes of a fuzzy old video blooper collection. Every TV show has them, they just have to be found. Given that sometimes they are lost in a closet somewhere, it's always a treasure when a disc producer finds them and digs them out for the rest of us to see.

Of particular merit is getting to see Nicholas Colasanto (Coach) goofing around as himself, not as the character we most identify him",1158537600,2,3238,4.817689530685921
1933716,5,B0000E32X2,"When I watch this DVD I think of how impressive Cheers was in that it had heart - genuine affection and incredible rapport between characters - but was also irreverent in its humor and unshy of the racy and the less than wholly tasteful.  Danson and Long in particular deserve credit for their outstanding performances and at least partial credit for their great chemistry (as there's always a component of that kind of spark between actors that seems entirely left to hance, I think) but the writing team was also formiddable in that it consistently avoided veering into the saccharine excess that has marked so many romantic plotlines in the sit. comedy genre, particularly of Cheers' day.  There are too many worthwile episodes to justify my listing them here, but this DVD constitutes what is undoutedly among my top 3 favorites of the show's 11 seasons.

Though it was remarkably consistent for laughs throughout its run, I personally prefer Cheers in the pre-Kirstie Alley days.  It's not that seasons 6-11, or Alley even, were bad, per se.  But it was a different show once Shelley Long left.  She really deserves all the lauds she received for her portrayal of the neurotic but well-inteded elitist Diane Chambers.  Along with the writers she created one of TV's truly memorable, suprisingly multi-dimensional characters in this season and the one preceding it.

The entire cast is stellar, their interaction so natural (also evident in the short but very amusing blooper reel) and the writing unusually (for its genre) and mercifully restrained in its laugh grabs.  In the post-Seinfeld era, few sitcoms have seamlessly combined irreverence and warmth the way Cheers did.  I miss(ed) it (until I got the DVDs, that is :-).",1116460800,9,1731,4.979166666666667
1933717,5,B0000E32X2,"One of the greatest television comedies in history, Cheers is an absolute ""must see"" for anyone who's ever had a regular hangout ""where everybody knows your name"". The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.

The Cheers (Season 2) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes and ignites Sam and Diane's long-lasting, on-again/off-again romance. This is also the first season in which Cliff Clavin is an ""opening-credits"" member of the cast (even though he appeared in most of season one's episodes). Guest appearances by Fred Dryer (of Hunter fame), Dick Cavett, Harry Anderson (of Night Court fame), and Christopher Lloyd (of Taxi and Back To The Future fame) make for some memorable comic sequences. The season ends with Sam and Diane's romance on shaky ground...

1933718,1,B0000E32X2,"As one other reviewer mentioned, there must be a defective batch of these Cheers season 2 DVDs.  The copy I got also had no sound.  I've trying playing them on three different DVD players, and the result was the same on all of them - perfect picture, but no sound.

It got even odder when I tried to play them on computer DVD drives - my home computer wouldn't play the DVDs at all, while my computer at work played them fine with both picture and sound.

Please note that my 1 star rating is not a comment on the quality of the show - Cheers is one of my all-time favorite TV shows and I'm really looking forward to watching season two.  But the frustration of dealing with this sound issue is what prompted the one star review.

Update:  After returning the set TWICE, I finally got a copy that would play on my Go Video DVD player with sound (plus it also worked in my XBox).  But when I tried to play it on the Samsung player (my main player, since it's hooked up to my home theater system), there was still no sound.

As a last ditch thing to try, I got Paramount's snail mail address from their web site and wrote them a (polite) letter about how frustrated I was with the whole situation.  To my amazement, a little over a week later a package arrived in the mail from Paramount.  No letter, no explanation, just another copy of the Cheers Season 2 set.  But this one plays absolutely fine (both audio and video) on every DVD player that I've tried.  And they didn't even ask me to send the defective copy back.

1933758,5,B0000E32X2,"Cheers was and is considered one of the great sitcoms of all time, and for good reason. One of the great failings of most sitcoms is the tendency to overload on one type of humor, to go too over the top or play it too straight. Cheers did both consistently well, as well as creating a lovable cast of losers who, in many ways, needed each other to survive.
The scene is set: a small bar in Boston, whose interractions among regulars and staff form the center of the show. The second season has bartender and ex-ballplayer Sam Malone and perpetual grad student Diane Chambers caught up in the ecstacies of romance. Their relationship made up many of the funny moments and a few serious ones in this season. There was also plenty of mirth coming from barfly Norm Peterson, postman Cliff Claven, the surly waitress Carla, and the confused Coach. The humor here is brilliant yet understated, as opposed to the later years of the show, which grew more raucous. The humor and warmth here comes from the people and the relationships, which was Cheers' greatest accomplishment: it made viewers wish they had a Cheers of their own.
For those of you who miss Cheers, there's now a chance to relive it. The second season will not disappoint.",1075161600,,1230,4.621004566210046

The show's second season saw it gain in popularity and solidify its place in NBC's famed Eighties Thursday night lineup.  This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of Season Two that were originally broadcast from September 1983 to May 1984.

The patrons of Cheers came from different backgrounds and social classes but had good chemistry and formed a community of sortsthey had their minor fallings-out but were friends most of the time.  Much of this season centered around the relationship between the bar's owner, Sam (Ted Danson) and his love interest Diane (Shelley Long), to the extent that the first part of the season was almost a dramedy, before more customary sitcom-style episodes predominated later in the season.

Parents should note that there are adult themes and adult humor throughout the season.  Guest stars included Dick Cavett and Christopher Lloyd.  As with many television seasons on DVD, there is a special features section on this one.
