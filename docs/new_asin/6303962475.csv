7857981,5,6303962475,"I expected a little moving screen as its a very old vhs movie, but over all its just as i remember. Wonderful family show, especially for the pirate or Halloween lovers (grandpa George in a giant eyeball XD!) Love it ",1481068800,,217,4.425
7857982,1,6303962475,this movie is by far the most insane thing thats ever happened to the film industry no plot at all,1324512000,,98,3.95
7857983,5,6303962475,"I feel this film was missed by the population at large. It is an absolutely wonderful little film. I suppose it falls under the genre of ""Family Film"" although it is a bit gritty in places (head chopping ghost pirates, after all!) and filled with funny moments that might be lost on younger children (nothing profane or rude, just minute and hilarious). All of the performances are truly top-notch, notably the Grandfather, Ian Bannen, the Teacher, Sheila McCarthy, and the Social Worker, Maury Chaykin. The latter two form a comedic duo that is absolutely hysterical! Of course you have your thrilling moments with the ghost pirates, but the real heart of this gem is the tender bond between the sensitive boy, George and his salty, sometimes harsh, Grandfather. The children are not just set pieces; they are vital and fully formed characters, full of charm and just enough trouble to motivate the plot. There is that signature Canadian feel to the comedic moments (which are plentiful). It is just twisted enough to make children think a bit harder and adults take notice. It has become a family favorite in our household, reserved to be watched only at Halloween to keep it fresh and always special. Please do your best to find and watch this terrific, forgotten childrens' classic.",1207958400,3,1286,4.9036697247706424

7857985,3,6303962475,"Ghosts, pirates, adventures and all... This movie is aimed for a family market but it does get a little boring. There are some things that I don't think are suitable for young kids like the beheadings and spooky voices (almost gave me nightmares!) but in all it's a good movie. Some good acting too but also some real bad.",971222400,3,322,4.47457627118644
