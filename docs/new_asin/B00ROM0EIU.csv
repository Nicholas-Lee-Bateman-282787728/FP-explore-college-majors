6934160,4,B00ROM0EIU,"I first became introduced to Ryan Pyle's photography a year ago, when I reviewed his photography book of western China. The man has a passion for China and has made it his home. As a hiker, backpacker and photographer myself, I admire his accomplishments. My most challenging hike was three weeks on the John Muir Trail in California five years ago, when climbing Mount Whitney was the climax of the hike.

China's western mountains, however, are no Mount Whitney. These mountains are remote, brutal and physically challenging. This is what Pyle wants to demonstrate in these four episodes in which he trekked routes hiked by local pilgrims and a caravan of yaks in 2014.

The cinematography is breathtaking. The colors are vibrant. Alpine vistas give way to verdant lush valleys of green and yellow and sprinkled with orange lichen. This is a landscape I'll never see for myself, and which I can only appreciate vicariously through this documentary.

The video for me was captivating. I wanted to watch it all in one sitting. The fast-motion clouds moving over the passes, the colorful banners blowing in the harsh wind, the locals wrapped up in their native cloths to keep warm, the prostrating pilgrims on the high mountain passes, the awkward yaks grunting nearby, all kept me glued to my TV.  The second episode covering the trek up Minya Konka is especially well done. Ryan always looks so tall and thin compared to the locals he talks to, with his yellowed teeth accentuated by the natives' white teeth, and his chilled physique covered in North Face gear. He talks about eating and drinking traditions (Yak Butter Tea, anyone?), Buddhist praying rituals, and injects his trekking narrative with Tibetan history. It's all very informative.

Pyle is passionate about China and it shows. He's got a good nature about this. But the one major thing that confused me is wanting to know what the objective of this video is. Is it to educate potential trekkers of the challenges of these hikes, or is it to introduce to the world the more remote and wild mountains of China that few of us get to experience? He's in front of the camera, all dressed out in his North Face gear, carrying a small day pack as he's climbing passes at 16,000+ feet. I got a great perspective of what hiking these trails is like, I got to see the challenges, but I got less of a feel for the locals and their daily challenges. Which has me thinking this documentary is more for people wanting to trek across China with sherpa guides and yak caravans.

This could easily be a five-star production for people interested in wanting to trek these sacred paths. There's also a sense of brotherhood here, as if the intended audience is the audience that also subscribes to Outdoor Magazine: the language is at times rugged and the focus is on Ryan. Yes, there are scenes in which Pyle is heard saying the ""F"" word. Couldn't they have been edited out? Especially since in most of the scenes he's talking about Tibetan or Buddhist rituals and then surprises the audience with, for example, an expletive-filled outcry when he gets an unexpected phone call. It's a minor thing and more of a genuine Pylism, but it's enough to keep more serious critics of this production from rating it highly. I reluctantly give this four stars when my adventurous side wants to give it five stars.  I'll be looking for Pyle's other trekking videos now.

Pros:
Beautiful cinematography
Solid introduction of the remoteness of SW China
Beautiful background music

Cons:
Video editing at times choppy
Lots of North Face endorsements (yet his Canon camera was taped over the logo!)
Unsure of intended audience. Is this for vicarious travelers or for the 30-something manly trekking crowd?
It's an Outside Magazine type production that wants to be National Geographic

6934161,5,B00ROM0EIU,"I like to be taken to a place, either through books or movies, where the unknown becomes known.  Mostly, I watch China in foreign film, but this TV series, is in English, and an eye-opening adventurous experience.

Ryan Pyle, is an award winning photographer and adventure traveler.  He invites the viewer to his incredible journey to the Sacred Mountains of China.  If you never knew these sacred mountains existed, you quickly learn the historically and culturally the existence.

The four holy mountains,  Mount Kailash,  Minya Konka Mountain, Amnye Maqen Mountain, Kara Korpo Mountain all have one thing in common, their history, and the numerous colorful flags left by the pilgrims.  Ryan Pyle takes us on his treks, and we experience the emotional toll it took.

On blu-ray, the scenery, landscape, is simply gorgeous!  There is so much to see, with the pilgrims,  the animals, the food, the elements, the customs, and most of all, the history.  This is a captivating TV series with so much to see, so much to learn!

Blu-Ray!!!  What a visual experience....  like you are standing right there with him.",1439424000,,1109,4.951086956521739
6934162,4,B00ROM0EIU,"Photographer/adventurer/hiker Ryan Pyle's video of his four mountain treks in Tibet and other parts of China offers breathtaking scenery and a glimpse of Chinese and Tibetan religion and culture in addition to the rugged landscapes and challenging mountain climbs.  Anyone who is fascinated with Chinese culture will find this video both rewarding and sometimes frustrating.  It's rewarding because it does offer a vivid high-definition glimpse of remote areas in China that most ordinary mortals like me will never see in person.  But it's also frustrating because Ryan's interaction with the natives, though friendly, is mostly superficial.  We learn what the natives eat, drink and how they live, but little about what the pilgrims and the people who live there are thinking and their views on life, their own lives and their opinions of foreigners.

The several minute intro to each of the four videos on this disc is the same, which I felt was repetitive and unnecessary after viewing it at the beginning of the first chapter.  That could have been indexed separately, so viewers of each adventure would not need to repeatedly sit through the same introduction.  It also seemed incongruous to me that Ryan Pyle was shown loading film into his camera.  Even The National Geographic Society, famed for its photographers and its travel/adventure photography, mostly transitioned from film to modern digital cameras about a decade ago.

Despite those minor criticisms, the Blu-ray video when projected on my 100-inch screen from this disc and my cinema projector is crisp and detailed as is the audio.  I felt that was quite an accomplishment given the primitive and often harsh conditions that Ryan Pyle and his entourage endured.  Post-production and editing was professionally-done throughout.  Disc was sent to me in exchange for an honest review, which you have just read.",1439164800,,1878,5.223333333333334
6934163,4,B00ROM0EIU,"Not at all jaded, and rightfully awed, Ryan Pyle serves as a charming and enthusiastic guide in this once-in-a-lifetime adventure navigating at high altitudes and sometimes extreme weather conditions, four sacred paths around four sacred mountains in China -- all captured on this three hour Blu-ray disc.

Production values are here -- the scenery is breathtaking and in all four episodes the cinematography is absolutely spectacular. And, despite the periodic hail, rain, snow and wind, both the shots and audio are crystal clear.

There are brief segments where the sound of wind whipping around is intentionally included so the viewer can more clearly envision the brutality of some segments of the journey. Regarding the 16:9 1080p disc itself, it played perfectly without any issues. Menu options are few  basically each of the four mountain episodes may be selected and thats it.

Culturally respectful and anxious to endure challenges both physical and mental he explained that during the toughest parts of the trek he confronted his own mortality and when faced with the solitude and jaw dropping majesty of the peaks  his own insignificance. Note, for those concerned, there is an occasional obscenity uttered and Pyle does strip down to his skivvies to bathe and immerse himself in the cultural traditions while enduring freezing cold water.

These wondrous sights are ones it is unlikely I will ever personally experience so the ability to share in Pyles journey is invaluable.

6934164,4,B00ROM0EIU,"I watched the Middle Kingdom Ride, which had Ryan and his brother circumnavigating China on their motorcycles and it was a great show. This video has Ryan hiking around several mountain in China and giving some background and history on each one. It was a great look at the culture in these regions, but the most striking part was seeing this Western guy hoof it around these mountains struggling with the weather and the altitude, and as he's doing it he's running into people who are doing the same trek but prostrating themselves every 2 steps. It's incredible. Takes them weeks! It's a fun watch and great to see it through the eyes of someone who loves obviously loves the country.",1437264000,,686,4.677685950413223
8695663,5,B00ROM0EIU,"Ryan Pyle presents a beautiful film of the Western mountains of China and the culture of the people that live in this remote region of the world high in the Tibetan regions.  Four sacred mountains are shown in this episode in the remote provinces of Ginghai, Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnah.  What an incredible experience for Ryan Pyle and his film crew to see this first hand and film it to share with the world.

8695664,5,B00ROM0EIU,"Well, let's see. I spent over twenty years in various branches of the military... mostly OUR Navy and Army.
I've been to places near India---Sri Lanka---and places near China---Hong Kong; Taiwan; Thailand; Vietnam;
Japan, yada yada yada. I've been through The Panama Canal as part of a 12-MPH sea-voyage from Guam to
Texas.
Look THAT up on a map! Now, mind you, I retired in Europe after all of my adventures, but, Ryan and HIS
brother, being Canadians didn't have THAT option to see the world in the Navy (does Canada HAVE a navy?).
They had to pay for and create their own adventures, and they have---singularly, AND as a team.
I really enjoyed the book, AND the video of the same title by Ryan Pyle. Even more so than the previous
book, and, their motorcycle adventures.
This is a wonderful journey from a man who has lived in China for over twelve years.
If occasional ""F-bomb"" language doesn't upset you, I'm guessing you'll love this salty travelogue more than
yak-butter tea!
There are 48 excellent photographs on 24---unnumbered---pages on top of the 144 with Mister Pyles accom-
panying narative of his most-recent adventures.
I saw all 185 minutes of the Blu-ray in ONE sitting, but it took a few days to finish his book; not because I
was bored, I just like a good book before falling to sleep. Now if I can just quit dreaming about yak butter
tea and falling into freezing water!
All of their adventure books and videos are entertaining... salty language and partial-nudity not withstanding.
The only fault I found with this book is an editing error on page 62. There's a sentence with the word ""theour"".
After reading that sentence TWICE, I discovered that the thought was the same whether you used THE or OUR
instead of ""THEOUR"". I'm an old military retiree that can barely WALK anymore, but I can relive MY youth by
watching The Ryan Boys' adventures from the comfort of my man-cave... or a book by my bed.

Merry Christmas and a Happy Adventure to YOU!",1449360000,,1968,4.671469740634006
8695665,5,B00ROM0EIU,"After watching the Blu-Ray DVD version of Ryan's trip to the Sacred Mountains i got the book.  I have to say the book is a must have to go along with the DVD.  Phenomenal detail of Human powered adventure mirrored with excellent writing and editing.  You take on Ryan's journey as he prepares mentally and physically to push himself through each trek, and you soak in the experiences with each step as if you were along side him on the same journey. The DVD consists of four episodes, each of a different mountain. They are 40-45 minute made-for-TV episodes, seamlessly put together giving us details of each trek before the adventure.

I highly recommend the Blu-Ray DVD of his trek through China and state that you must accompany it with the book.  Not only did I enjoy both but my family as well.  The video was fantastic and goes hand in hand with the book.  I look forward to seeing more videos produced from Ryan Pyle productions!",1446854400,,936,4.568862275449102
8695666,5,B00ROM0EIU,"I love to travel and watch travel documentaries, so I was excited when I was offered a copy of Extreme Treks: Sacred Mountains of China for review.  The title, Extreme Treks appealed to me even more, so I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately I do not have a Blu Ray player, so it took awhile to watch it.

This was the first time I had heard of Ryan Pyle, a photographer and host of this series who sets out to travel around four of the sacred mountains in China.  These are in the remote Tibet region, so this is not your regular tourist info guide.  This is a hard-core climbing adventure that could be very dangerous to an inexperienced adventurer.

The disc consists of four episodes, each dedicated to a different mountain.  The format is basically the same for each one. These are roughly 45 minute made-for-TV episodes without the commercials (which I love). He begins each climb by giving us the background of this sacred mountain while preparing for the trek. Then we watch him and his crew, as they encounters obstacles ranging from weather to exhaustion and hints of altitude sickness. Along the way, we get breathtaking shots that few people will ever see in person.

This is one of those adventures where the viewer thinks, I dream of trying something like this, but I never would actually do it.  These treks are really grueling, but his spirit is inspiring.  Im glad he did because the shots are absolutely beautiful, and I doubt Id ever learn about this region any other way. The shots are in HD, and the scenery is truly amazing.

Ryan has a lot of passion for what he does, and he is a true adventurer.  He includes a support crew made up of locals, which adds to the flavor of the region.  Along the way, he talks to us in the camera or with voice over so we get a feel for what he is going through.

I certainly learned about these mountains and the culture surrounding them while I was watching.  If you like true life adventure with fantastic scenery, this is a great show to watch.

I was sent a copy of this Blu-Ray in exchange for my honest review. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees",1445904000,,2193,4.458646616541353
8695667,4,B00ROM0EIU,"This DVD is pretty amazing, showing photographer Ryan Pile's journeys around the sacred mountains of China.

I'm so glad this was in HD because the cinematography is awesome.  I felt freezing cold and out of breath myself, watching Pyle hike up an 18,000 foot mountain.

I just got back from the southwestern part of Colorado. I was having breathing problems at 11,500 feet in the San Juan Mountains, much less as high up as Pyle was in this movie.

And then I'd be watching him as he panted along and a family would bypass him, with women and small children. Those Tibetans are tough.

I would recommend this for schools except the F bomb is dropped throughout. Other things were edited. Why leave in the bad language?

Also, it would have been great to have this closed captioned since I am partially deaf.

NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.",1444176000,,874,4.62987012987013
8695668,5,B00ROM0EIU,"More from the physical and mental perspectives, which really draws you into the drama of the challenges. Superb visually. Yes, spiritual information is given, but in the linear mental way of telling you about it so that it will not make anyone feel uncomfortable.",1443398400,,263,5.0
8695669,5,B00ROM0EIU,This is definitely a video you want to watch over and over again. Ryan goes on a journey to visit four sacred mountains in China. I loved the way that you knew where he was traveling and why. He didn't sugar coat the walk. You knew it was difficult. You understood the strength it took when times were tough to push on. This was wonderful because I learned so much about China. This is the way to learn it. It was fun and kept you watching from beginning to end. I had no idea there were so many areas in China. I learned how dangerous the terrain could be. I don't think I've watched a video in a long time that held my attention the way this one did. Love his work.,1441843200,,667,4.0606060606060606
8695670,4,B00ROM0EIU,"""Extreme Treks: Sacred Mountains of China, Season 1"" is my first foray into the video diary of adventure seeker, Ryan Pyle.

I know of Mr. Pyle from a beautiful book of his visit to a remote village in China.  What left a mark on my about that book was his sincerity.  He didn't treat a foreign culture disrespectfully or at worse as an ""Ugly American""-- although he is Canadian.

In Extreme Treks, this is a careful look at the landscape and communities that live in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan.  I think it's a 6-episode collection.

The most telling of his adventures and one that made me laugh was when they attempted to hire a woman to be the cook for an expedition and she backed out of the agreement the morning of the trip demanding more money.  Ah ha!  Capitalism has reached into the most desolate of places.

I like this series and to see it on Blu Ray is absolutely stunning and you have a little more than 3 hours worth of gorgeous landscape.

This is a great vista into the mysterious yet intriguing land of China.",1441756800,,1052,4.432291666666667
8695671,4,B00ROM0EIU,"I don't normally go for travel logs or documentaries, so I was hesitant when I was offered a copy of Extreme Treks: Sacred Mountains of China for review.  Yet something about it appealed to me, so I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.

This was also my introduction to Ryan Pyle, a photographer, our host, and the adventurer who sets out to travel around four of the sacred mountains in China.  These are remote, mostly in the Tibet region, and the only way to do so it to hike them.  Oh, and did I mention the altitude?  This is not a simple day stroll but a multi-day adventure that could turn deadly if proper precautions aren't taken.

The disc consists of four episodes, each dedicated to a different mountain.  The format is pretty much the same.  He arrives and spends a little time acclimating to the altitude and explaining to us a bit about how this mountain is considered sacred.  Then he sets out with his support crew, and we get breathtaking shots along the way as he encounters obstacles ranging from weather to exhaustion and hints of altitude sickness.

As I was watching, all I could think was Id never survive this.  What he went through in his treks is awe inspiring.  But Im glad he did because the shots are absolutely beautiful, and I doubt Id ever learn about this region any other way.

Because these are roughly 45 minute made for TV episodes (and I don't know where they initially aired), we get just an overview of what he saw and experienced over the multiple days he spent filming and hiking.  Honestly, at times, I felt like I could have watched more just to see the landscape.

At other times, however, I felt like things were a little repetitive, maybe because I watched them several nights in a row.  If I had spaced them out, I don't think I would have felt this way.

While Ryan did travel with a support crew made up of locals, this is definitely his show.  Almost all the dialogue is him telling us about what has happened, either in voiceover or directly into the camera from the trail.

This Blu-Ray consists of four episodes of the show, so roughly 3 hours of material.  There are no bonus features.  However, you do get the shots in glorious HD, which helps you feel like you are right there.  The sound is in stereo, and it is great as well.

A quick note (that is also included on the disc packaging) that there are a couple of uses of unbleeped language on the shows.  He also strips down to take a dip in a creek at one point.  Keep that in mind if you are thinking of watching with your kids.

Ryans passion for China comes through on this disc, and I certainly learned about these mountains and the culture surrounding them while I was watching.  It was well worth taking these vicarious Extreme Treks.

8695672,5,B00ROM0EIU,"When Pyle talks about THE SACRED MOUNTAINS OF CHINA, on the DVD series Extreme Treks, what you don't know until you get into the series, is that he will be hiking a KORA (circumnavigation) of four mountains sacred to Tibetan Buddhism.  The first mountain is Mount Kailash, near Lake Manasarovar, a lake sacred to three religions, Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, and the Bon religion. (Bon was the indigenous shamanistic religion of the Tibetan Plateau, before the arrival of Buddhism.) Pyle takes a sacred dip in the icy lake, before he begins his Kora of Mount Kailash. Although he says he's not a Buddhist, at times Pyle seems very aware of these Tibetan traditions. For example, he tells us one month of prayer around a sacred mountain, provides as much good karma, as 10,000 years of prayer in a city. Yes, these sacred mountains are that beautiful. Just the stunning scenery alone, will bring you closer to the spiritual state of Nirvana. Some of the passes around the mountains are high, and are difficult for a lowlander from Shanghai to breathe correctly.  Some of the (unintentionally?) funny scenes involve Pyle complaining about the danger of hiking in these high altitudes, the difficulty of the passes, the brutal cold.  Then, he'll be overtaken by a man carrying a baby on his back, followed by his wife and her mother. Or, on another mountain, when two older women are seen doing the Kora as prostrations. Pyle of course isn't just complaining to make noise. Tibetans have double the lung capacity of regular people, and are habituated to the conditions of the Tibetan Plateau.  What you really get from this DVD series, is just the way Tibetan Buddhism consumes these people's lives. Who would take their two week vacation, to circumnavigate a 17,000 foot high mountain, if it were part of Christianity?  Pyle stops at various Tibetan Monasteries, or finds a busy tea room, near the most remote parts of one Kora.  It's all so beautiful, and the cinematography is to die for. That's the reason this is released on Blu-ray, because you'll want to savor every detail of the amazing mountains, and the culture, of these people. Pyle doesn't weigh you down with factoids about Buddhism, or local history, or anything else.  At one point he's sitting beneath this lovely statue of Avalokiteshvara, yet doesn't tell the viewer what they are seeing, or its importance. (Avalokiteshvara is the Bodhisattva, that the Dali Lama is supposedly the reincarnation of. Its the national ""saint"" of Tibet.)  I might have liked to hear a bit more info about the religion. We do get lots of cultural traditions, including how to drink your Po Cha (Yak Butter Tea---its GOOD!) Believe me, if you are at all interested in Tibetan Culture, or Tibetan Buddhism, you will fall in love with this series. (Although many of these mountains, are not technically within the province of Tibet, Tibetan Buddhism spread from Tibet, throughout western China, all the way up to Mongolia.  So it's culturally unified, even the landscapes are mostly similar.)

ABOUT YOUR TRAVEL COMPANION
Nobody wants to take a long journey, with a boring, or self involved, travel companion. One of the most important qualities of a good travel documentary, is the personality of the host. That's why Michael Palin from Monty Python made such a cool travel companion, in the long series of travelogues he hosted.... Palin is very witty. Pyle, as a person, and as your travel companion, is not at all like Palin. He's sensitive, often emotionally overwhelmed by the beauty of his surroundings. Logically speaking, I assume its because of Pyle's training as a photographer. Yet more than that, even though he's not a Buddhist, these four Koras are obviously a spiritual journey for him. He's not an archeologist, so you won't get history out of him, and since he's not a Buddhist monk, you won't get Tibetan Buddhism thrown at you.  Instead, imagine doing these koras with your best friend, who is open, and sensitive, to the profound beauty that surrounds him. That's the vibe I get off him.

I really enjoyed watching this series, and will return to it again and again. You'd have to be dead inside, not to be affected by this series.

YAK BUTTER TEA RECIPE
You'll want to watch this drinking yak butter tea. If you don't have yak butter, just use cow butter. I won't tell.
TWO CUPS WATER
Two bags Lipton tea....or any good black tea. (Try Pu-erg tea. Might be amazing.)
2 tablespoons yak butter
1/4 teaspoon salt.
1/4 cup milk or half and half.
DIRECTIONS
OK, boil your water. Add your tea. (Use more tea, for stronger tea.) Simmer the tea for three minutes, then take off stove. Remove bags, or strain out the tea leaves. Now, add some butter, your salt (Use a little less, for less intense flavor), and your milk. OK, put this in the blender, and blend for three minutes. You see Tibetan churning their tea, before they drink it. So you MUST include this step. After its done being blended in the blender, its ready to drink. Your first sip will be strange, but I quickly learned to love this tea. The salt helps you keep hydrated, when you walk around these Tibetan Peaks. The milk and butter, are basically like cream. I add a bit of sweetener to my tea, so it doesn't taste like soup. Before you drink it, stick your finger in the tea, and flick it three times.
1. For your ancestors
2. For the gods
3. For the earth  (I think that's what they did in the documentary.)
Burn some Tibetan Incense too, when you drink your tea. Now, enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of TIBET. yeah!",1439856000,2,5614,4.751540041067762
