8502489,5,B006P0FI9C,"I didn't realize this was a Hammer Films motion picture when I began to stream it last evening . When I further observed that Val Quest (The Quatermass Xperiment , Quatermass 2 , The Abominable Snowman , Killer Force) was the director , It was understood I was in for something of much substance and no small amount of merit . This film may strike you and stick with you as it has me . I look forward to coming by a DVD copy . The Japanese (with the action set in Burma) are not caricatured at all . Neither are the Brit troops and their embedded journalist . This is war on an intimate level with superb performances and writing all about . Korean American actor Philip Ahn , The first Asian American actor to earn a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame , is exceptional as well . I had the great fortune of streaming this esoteric gem thanks to the Roku channel Classic Reel . Still only $1.99 a month with a copious catalog and a great deal to recommend it .",1463875200,,959,4.161290322580645

8502492,4,B006P0FI9C,"One of the few films to relate the oft forgotten southeast Asian theater of WII. Hammer Films, known more today for their more famous Gothic horror films from the 50's-70's, made a war film. More specifically a war drama and psychological thriller about what you may think you can get away with in the jungle. People who think Vietnam was the dirty war of the last century fought in Asia and that World War Two was the clean war have not looked deeply enough. WWII was just as dirty, by both axis and allies. But the victors write the history. A rag tag group of British soldiers have been cut off from their brigade and are lost and without communications. They come across a Burmese village occupied by the Japs and a battle ensues. The British kill most of the Japs and sustain casualties themselves. They also capture an enemy map showing battle plans. There is a collaborator, a Burmese who has been helping the Japs at this village and knows exactly what the map means. The British commander threatens to shoot him if he doesn't cooperate and then shoots two innocent civilian villagers to show he will execute this collaborator. There are a press correspondent and an Anglican priest there as well who condemn him sternly and promise justice will be served him. Later the Japs recapture the village and hold the Brit Captain and his surviving troops prisoner. They want to know where the Jap troops that were in the village previously went and what happened to the map. They threaten to shoot his troops one by one until he sings.
  There were no holds barred in this movie. This was probably just how it was there. One highlight was the Japanese intelligence officer pointing out the hypocrisy of the British captain telling the Japs that they started this war and must play by the rules, after what he has done, though the Japs have not discovered what happened. The Jap officer correctly points out the British aggression against the Sudan, India, South Africa, and asked him if the Brits had a code of conduct in those invasions. Now that instead of spears and slings they are facing an enemy with rifles, ships and tanks of their own they want to have a code of ethics for the enemy to follow. Not happening, said the Jap officer, this is total war too, just like you British practiced before. Good movie.",1420416000,2,2317,4.621359223300971
8502493,4,B006P0FI9C,A decent action movie with some good acting. Stanley Baker is always a strong screen presence. Viewers who like war films will like this one.,1377475200,2,141,4.68
8502494,5,B006P0FI9C,"Val Guest's war film ""Yesterday's Enemy"" is an interesting companion piece to his equally excellent war film, ""The Camp on Blood Island"". The latter was a study of the impact of violent incarceration by the enemy on the captives in a prisoner-of-war camp. In ""Yesterday's Enemy"" the nature of the enemy and their identity is not so clear cut. The captain of a band of Pommy soldiers orders the killing of innocent villagers with the expectation he will get information on a Japanese attack. When the Japs succeed and capture the Poms, the shoe is on the other foot for the captain. Stanley Baker is brilliantly cast as the morally dubious captain who finds when you live by the sword expect to die by it. An emotionally charged film in the Sam Fuller mould. Good support from Aussie Leo McKern, Gordon Jackson, Guy Rolfe and Burt Kwouk.",1363824000,4,836,4.6938775510204085
8502495,5,B006P0FI9C,"I first saw this movie more than 30 years ago and I have been looking for this in a DVD/Blue Ray format and for the US market. This is a very powerful movie and its message very relevant today. Everyone should see this movie and for them to make their own conclusions about it.

Another movie I have been looking for is ""The Naked and the Dead"" based on a Norman Mailer novel.",1305676800,7,376,4.1506849315068495
8502496,5,B006P0FI9C,"This film has many fine English actors.  Including Stanley Baker and Gordon Scott among others.  The scene appears to be set in the early part of the Burma Campaign when the Japanese were ascendant.  Stanley Baker is leading a desperate remnant of a British battalion that has been isolated and cut-off like the larger elements of its parent Brigade and Division.  They come upon a Burmese village where a series of deadly and shocking events occur.

 The film portrays well the brutality of jungle warfare and the initial advantages the Japs had before the British caught on and later beat them at their own game.  Great acting shows how circumstances force a humane British officer to make extreme choices.  His Japanese counter part has few such scruples and and the film shows very well how brutal the Japanese were in their conduct of the war.

The title of the film has a certain ironic twist to it.  Implying how an enemy of yesterday may or may not be a friend today!  A worthy classic which should be released in the USA as it has universal appeal.  The moral issues raised in the film are very important even today.",1291420800,6,1125,4.626262626262626
