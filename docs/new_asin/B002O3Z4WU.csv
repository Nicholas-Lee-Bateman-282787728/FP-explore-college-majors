3960712,5,B002O3Z4WU,"Empire of the Sun takes the viewer on a journey into China as war consumes significant portions of the vast country. The story follows young Jamie Graham, an English boy who is living in the international district of Shanghai. Jamie finds himself separated from his family and fending for himself as war takes hold of Shanghai. From the point of view of a foreign boy, the film provides insight into how China and foreigners living there were ill-treated by the Japanese during WWII. The narrative is rich with humor, calamity and adventure. A young Christian Bale plays Jamie Graham, and his performance is energetic and convincing.

3960713,5,B002O3Z4WU,"Empire of the Sun is a movie about young Jamie Graham who is caught in the midst of the taking of Shanghai by the Japanese during WWII, the same day as Pearl Harbor in 1941. He gets captured and is taken to a Japanese Camp, but finds that it is not so bad. During the movie however, Jamie grows and sadly loses his innocence that is apparent in the beginning of the movie. Now, just because I have this movie 5 Stars does not mean that it is without it's faults. I will admit that during the time when Jamie is in the camp, it grew a little tedious at times, and dragged, but not too much. The only other part that I didn't really care for that much is the ending. Spielberg is KNOWN to have dramatic, feel good endings, and I really thought that this movie needed a nice payoff. It ends, sort of on a sad note, but I guess that's to demonstrate that Jamie isn't a happy little kid anymore, he's a troubled young adult who has seen  horrors he should never have. The casting in the movie is superb! Young Christian Bale is OUTSTANDING in this movie and really steals the whole entire movie, even though he is the main character. John Malkovich here is also good, but Christian shines above them all. Also, we see a side in Spielberg that we would see in his blockbuster movie Schindler's List, and we see that he shows the cruelties and hardships of war. So yes, like every movie, this has its faults, but it truly is a golden movie, and I wish more movies like this could be made to show people that it's okay to let a little tears flow during movies! With a score by John Williams and direction by Spielberg, how could you go wrong!?!",1313107200,4,1636,4.243589743589744
3960714,5,B002O3Z4WU,"This movie has so many outstanding gifts....when watched closely..and not as a war story..that in itself makes this movie a wonderfully fascinating experience of this young mans ability to survive..but going really not far deeper..every aspect of this young mans ability to read people, AND SURVIVE..namely the Japanese soldiers..his education of his trusting skills..and kindness..while his mind..was taxed beyond description..
This movie is a wealth of education for the young people to see and experience..as hopefully we will never be presented with such war horrors..the survival skills..on living in the outside world when it is flipped up side down!..ones preconceived notions that ones life is owed to them..in the standards to which they have become accustomed..I wish this movie was shown in every schoolroom!...analyzed and used as a study discussion vehicle...so as to strengthen, and bring our young people into the experiences..that can strengthen them for their futures..and the unknown! I've seen this movie many times before..have it in both my library's at my 2 homes..and now upgraded to DVD..An awesome movie! I gave this as a gift...the recipients were in awe!",1302566400,5,1181,5.4945054945054945
3960715,5,B002O3Z4WU,"When ""Empire of the Sun"" was released at the theaters I remember friends telling me it was a depressing movie.  For that reason I avoided it for what turned out to be twenty four years.  Then I read here on Amazon that it was basically the first movie in Spielberg's war trilogy that included Shindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, two of my favorite movies.  At $5.99 for the Keepcase version I really had nothing to lose so I purchased the DVD.  The movie was not depressing, it was incredibly touching.

First, the Keepcase DVD transfer is absolutely beautiful.  The 1.85:1 aspect ratio fills a widescreen HDTV with sharp images, beautiful colors, and rich detail.  This is one film that does not need a blu-ray upgrade ever.

Second, even though the film is based upon a novel, the film is pure Spielberg storytelling.  With amazing detail Spielberg demonstrates the chaotic turmoil war inflicts upon the life of one boy about to enter adolescence.  Although the boy is forced to mature quickly to become a survivor, he holds tight to his one boyhood love throughout the movie; his love of aviation.  As a former Navy pilot maybe I could relate a little too much, but the scene when he first touches an airplane in the presence of pilots is Spielberg at his absolute finest, a scene that will stay with me for a long time.

Wiser people than me say people, places, and things come into our lives at just the right moment when we either need them or can appreciate them the most. After twenty four years I'm thankful ""Empire of the Sun"" is now part of my life and I truly appreciate the artistic expression Spielberg created with the movie.",1299369600,5,1645,4.615120274914089
3960716,5,B002O3Z4WU,Nearly every shot in this movie could be turned into a portrait fit to be hung on your wall. A remarkable story of an intelligent but self centered boy who after loosing everything over the course of a war comes to find compassion.,1291075200,6,231,4.395348837209302
3960717,4,B002O3Z4WU,"When I saw this movie as a kid, I didn't really care for it much. Now, I've seen this movie at least six more times, and it has grown on me. The film contains a very compelling story about a young British boy who soon finds himself alone when the Japanese take over Shanghai during World War II. His life changes completely when he, along with some of his brand new adult friends, is taken to an internment camp. The boy (played fantastically by a young Christian Bale) goes through some incredible changes in his life, and this is where the story becomes very intriguing.

I'm not really a fan of Spielberg, but this film is just one of his few films that I truly admire. It has a solid performance by Bale, a stellar supporting cast, some beautiful music, realistic sets, and breathtaking cinematography. It's a very good film, and it deserves its recognition among the general public.

Grade: 8.5/10",1282089600,4,902,4.596273291925466
3960718,5,B002O3Z4WU,"This is a Spielberg movie that came out before Schindler's List, and I wonder if that has something to do with the lack of critical respect that it deserved. While it had some of the classic Spielberg whimsy and flash, the storyline and acting were excellent. Though not on par with the likes of Out of Africa and a A Passage to India, there is something in this movie that is just as epic as those two films. Christian Bale's performance was amazing; nothing like the films that he is known for these days. John Williams soundtrack for this movie is one of his best.

This movie was filmed in Shanghai in the 1980s - before China's economic boom - and in the extras of the DVD version that I own Spielberg notes that they couldn't as easily replicate World War II China with a 2000's Shanghai as the could with the way it looked in the 1980s. Europeans caught in between the Chinese and Japanese during World War II is an interesting aspect of the movie, duplicated somewhat in a more recent movie The White Countess.

I can't help but think that if this movie had been made after Schindler's List that it might have received a lot more acclaim. It really is a good film and I highly recommend it.",1255996800,,1198,4.391891891891892

3960739,5,B002O3Z4WU,"To me this is a real look at the British colonialists in places like China both before WW!! and after the war.  The first few scenes of the movie are reminiscent of the early scenes of Titanic as a study of British arrogance during that period of time.  Beautifully directed.  I was so stunned by the first few scenes of the totally decadent Costume Party with the young boy dressed as some sort of young eastern world prince and everyone making jokes of the impending war like it could never touch them.  I couldn't turn it off after that and watched as disaster hit in the invasion of the Japanese.  You see the whole thing through the eyes of the young aristocratic boy who never really seems to manage to realize the total mess he is in.  The scene where he makes it back to his old home, sees lights and immediately believes that his parents are back  home and everything will be the same is proof of the fact that he has never realized what has happened.  From then on he and the friends who picked him up are at an internment camp and I do feel that that part of the movie is not as realistic as it might have been maybe the truth would have been too horrible.  It's a gripping movie and beautifully acted, photographed and directed.  Christian Bale is in almost every scene and is amazing.  I don't know why he never had a bigger career.",1478476800,,1345,4.318725099601593

3960744,5,B002O3Z4WU,"It really is too bad they don't make films as powerful and touching as this any longer. Absolutely the best film ever in my opinion and Spielberg just is simply a genius at gripping your mind and heart with his insistence on historical/cultural accuracy and his ability to capture ""moments"" that are just beyond most producers to achieve. I can't think of but a couple other films where you go from one emotion to another in the Cadillac Of The Skies scene where Bale is admirably saluting the Jap kamikaze pilots in solidarity with his choir voice, to watching one of those very planes get blown up as it hits the air into the bombing scene.... that has to be the greatest sequence of roller coaster action ever filmed....bravo Christian Bales! There are just so many other subtleties that make this film work for me and the 2.5 hours goes by quickly. Like the dove cooing in the background as they wake up in the arena where the confiscated cars/belongings were.....a simple addition that just makes the scene so realistic. The symbolism that Spielberg uses to convey this coming of age classic is on a level never before seen because although we see this through a child's eyes, the ramifications apply to all life regardless of age.....these facets could be written about with thousands more words. A must OWN film!",1466812800,2,1319,4.739130434782608

These shallow people rated the flick only one star because they had preconceived notions of how the movie should play out and were disappointed when they realized that the writer and director do not think like them. The move deals with what people are like when they are suddenly thrust into severity. Some fold up and others rise up. It accurately recalls atrocities that prisoners endured and how each person dealt with them. At the center of the movie is the plight of a 10 year boy who undergoes a transformation after being thrust into a war camp.

3960792,5,B002O3Z4WU,"It's quite simply Steven Spielberg's best work. Hands down. Period.

It's better than ET, Schindler's List, and everything else the great and storied director has ever done. That is how good this movie is.

The story is just beyond captivating. It's very long, but in the Shawshank Redemption way where you are just so engrossed by the story that you don't notice how much time is passing.

Christian Bale plays a snooty British brat child living in Hong Kong who gets separated from his parents when the Japanese take over. At first he's living on the streets in slum like conditions, a drastic change from the life of privilege he knows. He has to quickly learn how to be self sustaining or he'll die. This happens when he meets up with John Malkovich's character (EASILY Malkovich's best role both in terms of the character and his acting) who gives him some direction on how to survive. The two end up being captured and sent to a Japanese internment camp for several years where life ranges from survivable on the best days to brutal on the worst. Due to the hardship, Bale's character grows into a strong self reliant young man.

It's all set against the backdrop of the ever worsening condition of the Japanese military as the war progresses. You see career fighter pilots in the beginning becoming Kamikaze pilots with full ceremony honoring their sacrifices before their final flights. Then that slowly progresses into whatever kids the Japanese air force can scrounge up to fly Kamikaze missions, with the ceremony prior to those flights being much less meaningful. It just does such a wonderful job of showing how desperate the Japanese became in the final days of the war.

The visuals are stunning. I mean breathtakingly amazing. Visually it's so good you could enjoy the film on mute just form the images.

And the music the story is set to is perfect. It's very calm, soothing orchestrations that are set opposite some horrible violent imagery. That juxtaposition hasn't been done so well since Robert DiNiro stared in The Mission.

All told, it's a must see film. There is no way around it. This is an unappreciated absolute masterpiece. It's one of the most magnificent films ever made. And most people have never even heard of it.",1419292800,,2248,4.79328165374677

3960799,2,B002O3Z4WU,"I admit that an undertaking of this scale, as any such cinematic endeavor is, is fraught with reductionist and representational problems. Most Americans need a very clear Good Guys/Bad Guys scenario, and although Spielberg looks to give his characters a bit more depth, he does so in exceedingly overblown, unrealistic ways (witness the final encounters with the Japanese Camp head and the Japanese pilot friend). My biggest gripe, other than the pedantic second reference to Jack's witnessing the bomb (did Spielberg think we didn't realize he confused it with Mrs. Victor's passing? - the already maudlin scene would have been far stronger without the repetition), was the overly sentimental music, which was a major intrusion. Yuck. All that Hollywood has come to be disliked for, the larger-than-life-treacle about heavier themes .... like WWII.

3960822,2,B002O3Z4WU,"I'm amazed at how many people love this movie.  I can tell a lot of money was spent to make this movie, and acting was good but the story struck me as overly dramatic and uneven.  I'm glad the library saved me my money on this DVD.  I'll skip viewing the second disc.

Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, I think the late Roger Ebert summed it up nicely when he wrote:

""The movie's general lack of direction leads to what seems like a series of possible endings; having little clear idea of where he was going, Spielberg isn't sure if he has arrived there. The movie's weakness is a lack of a strong narrative pull from beginning to end. The whole central section is basically just episodic daily prison life and the dreams of the boy. Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances. But despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.""

If you want to know what really happened read this passage from Ballard's autobiography Miracles of Life:  ""For me, the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents. I slept, ate, dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room, in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai. But I revelled in this closeness. Lying in bed at night I could, if I wanted to, reach out and take my mother's hand. I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.""

A fascinating subject I plan on  reading J.G. Ballard's award-winning novel, the sequel, and his autobiography too but I would recommend skipping the movie.",1381622400,2,1680,4.5364238410596025
3960823,5,B002O3Z4WU,"One of Spielberg's least-known movies is arguably his masterpiece, the most visually poetic film since Lawrence of Arabia, and possibly ever. It contains literally stunning images and sequences, not for their scenic beauty but for their emotional impact and Spielberg's genius at composition and at telling stories with pictures. Based on the autobiographical novel by J.G. Ballard, it is about the son of a British family living in Shanghai before the outbreak of World War II. Spielberg at the peak of his talent devises images and sequences unlike anything else in the movies. Of these there are many, but four stand out as most memorable: One is a caravan of limousines carrying British families across the poverty-stricken city on the way to a costume party. Another, which follows shortly thereafter, involves the son, Jim (future Oscar-winner Christian Bale, in a terrific debut role - he's onscreen nearly the entire time), flying a glider across a field. In yet another, Jim, who is fascinated with aircraft, spots a Japanese Zero on the ground and approaches it. A mechanic is welding part of the fighter and the sparks create the effect of a shower of stars. As Jim reaches the Zero and touches it almost lovingly, in the background two Japanese pilots stand silhouetted against the rising sun. And in the fourth - and most riveting - scene, American fighters attack the Japanese air base where Jim and many other British nationals are being held for the duration of the war. Done with real P-51 Mustangs, plus some large, radio-controlled models, the sequence is likely to take your breath away; it matches the greatest moments in cinema. With John Malkovich as a scheming American living in China, Joe Pantoliano as his weasel of a sidekick, Miranda Richardson as a world-weary aristocrat, and Nigel Havers as a doctor who becomes the boy's mentor. Beautifully shot by Alan Daviau, and featuring a magnificent score by John Williams, this movie will haunt you long after the fadeout - and maybe forever.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1381622400,6,2267,5.517241379310345

3960825,5,B002O3Z4WU,"Some films never age, they just become more important with repeated viewings. This is the time to add this DVD to your library at the extraordinarily inexpensive price. It is a treasure and seeing 26 years after its initial release only enhances the impact this film made on the world not yet ready for such an epic.

Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel `The Empire of the Sun' which tells the story of a boy, James Graham (Christian Bale, very young and very talented), whose privileged life is upturned by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, December 8, 1941. Separated from his parents, he is eventually captured, and taken to Soo Chow confinement camp, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him. Somehow Bale manages to transform from the pampered British aristocracy in Shanghai through the changes brought about by the Japanese invasion of China and becomes a survivor and a little hero role model to many.

Steven Spielberg directs this epic with a cast that includes John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson , Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, Leslie Phillips, Masat Ibu, Ben Stiller among others.  It is a deeply moving film, beautifully captured in cinematography and musical scoring - a film that belongs in the library of all film buffs. Grady Harp, August 13",1375660800,2,1460,5.0

This film - has already been eloquently reviewed here and I have little to add except my indignation that anyone could possibly view this adaptation of the book--and it is an adaptation, make no mistake, taking many creative liberties--but in ways that intensify the reality of what this child experienced.  Christian Bale is UNBELIEVABLE at this early age.  I have literally watched this film over and over again in one long sitting (what can I say, I was an insomniac at the time).  I find it mesmerizing.  It's also a little-seen view of the impact of WWII on the expats who remained trapped behind enemy lines in China.  I'm honestly not a huge spielberg fan.  I like his early works.  Maybe that's why i like this movie.  I think a lot of his contemporary stuff is self-indulgent... trash.  Not all, but much.  For instance I think he was involved in Super 8 but worked well with JJ Abrams (Super 8 is the ET for the 21st century IMO).  But I digress.  If you like WWII dramas (not for battle scenes, although you will find them here also), but the human dramas, you must see this classic.",1346630400,3,1149,4.573529411764706
3960846,2,B002O3Z4WU,"The movie was long (about 2.5 hours) and it felt long. During several parts that I knew would be slow, I started to fast forward 30-seconds at a time until something actually happened (or until someone spoke).

Generally, I liked the story it told. By that I mean, the story of what happened to the Western folks in Shanghai, China when the Japanese took over.

Here are some things that I didn't like:
* There were several slow parts throughout the film.
* It is sometimes difficult to understand Jim's British accent.
* Jim declares he is an atheist.
* To get money, Malkovich's character tries to sell Jim to a Chinese man.
* Jim plays with Japanese Zero planes as if they were to be admired.
>>>> Jim's a kid, but his parents could have addressed that.
* Jim salutes Japanese airmen.
* Jim's whiny voice...it got on my nerves.
* When Jim spoke Japanese, there were no subtitles to translate what he said (and those scenes lost meaning because of it).
And...
When Jim temporarily sneaks out of the prison camp and a Japanese guard tries to track him, the Western/American men (prisoners) excitedly place bets if Jim will be killed or not...all while watching Jim from a distance.

There were other disturbing scenes, but they were more in line with what you would expect in a Japanese prison camp.

At about 1.5 hours into the film, I considered turning it off; but I figured I'd watched most of it, so I decided to finish it. For me, the movie was about 2 hours long, because I fast forwarded through several slow parts or parts with no dialogue.

The ending was emotional and happy.

This is not the kind of movie that I would watch again.

3960849,4,B002O3Z4WU,"Under the direction of Steven Spielberg, Empire of the Sun promises to be stunning spectacle of life in China in the cocoon of the British ruling class in Shanghai. Jim, or Jamie, is played by Christian Bale who lives in this world of privilege and wealth attending public school and singing in the choir so popular in the Church of England. A host of Chinese servants dote on the only child accustomed to getting his way.  Japanese encampments and Chinese poverty surround this idyllic life. After Pearl Harbor, Jamie's life changes forever.

As the Japanese move into Shanghai, he is separated from his parents in the panic to avoid the oncoming Japanese, and his odyssey to an internment camp begins where the young boy learns to become a commoner quickly adapting to the necessities of bartering and pilferage common to those starving. He ingratiates himself with the Japanese, befriends a Japanese youth across the wire, is sheltered by the British and encouraged by Americans to take risks that involve personal danger, he gains the admiration of the latter, and is taken under the wing of Basie, a man he idolizes, played by John Malkovich who makes room for him in the American quarters. ""You're an American now, kid. Don't let me down.""

The Japanese become harsher in their treatment of these civilian interns as American forces draw closer, and the camp commander gives a beating to the British doctor (Nigel Havers) who has become a father figure to Jim. Quick to react, he prostrates himself before the Japanese so he can save face by sparing the doctor. When the Americans strafe and bomb the airfield near the encampment the cheering boy comes to grips with the fear that he has not faced. He cannot remember what his parents look like. The bravado he acquired being with the Americans is gone forever. The boy has come of age, but not quite.

When American forces find him, he is turned over to an orphanage where parents come to find the children they lost.  Will the parents recognize him, and will the dazed lad recognize them?

Four things make this a film worth viewing. It introduces Christian Bales who turns in an outstanding performance. The music is superb. Sun Gn, a Welsh lullaby, is the theme song and is sung beautifully by James Rainbird. Nigel Havers, Miranda Richardson, and Joe Pantoliano are excellent in supporting roles. Finally, Steven Spielberg's direction is classic. What detracts from the song is that Steven Spielberg's direction is classic. It is long and drawn out. The plot plods to excruciating length to the point that you start asking when the movie will be over.

It was a box office disappointment but made a profit in other venues. It was nominated for six awards. It was also one film that was better than the book.

After you have seen this movie, I doubt that you will want to view it again, except for your favorite scenes that can be found through that lifesaver known as You Tube. See it for the music.",1336262400,2,2960,4.756335282651072

 MUST SEE!",1329782400,3,172,4.0588235294117645
3960852,5,B002O3Z4WU,"I'm so thankful for Amazons' wide variety of things...I've been looking for this movie for a few years. It's one of the best movies i have ever seen, I always choke up at the end. It's kind of a long movie but the greatest ones are worth it, and i recommend people watching it the 1st time to make sure your focusing on the movie so you can really see everything that goes on. You need to see it if you haven't. And i think it's great for 12years and older just because its more serious and younger kids might not understand it. But I'm 16 and I love it!",1329091200,6,554,4.045454545454546

3960855,1,B002O3Z4WU,"Story of a rather pathetic, unprepared, and unrealistic family. Not a heroic survival tale. More of a stumble and fumble along barely surviving on luck. No smart witty survival skills. Just a blind chaotic nightmare.",1323129600,5,216,5.2

3960857,5,B002O3Z4WU,"Unlike the photo of cover art shown by Vendor, this Item came with English & French title-art on Cover (which indicates to me a foreign version).  Worked fine on my Sony DVD player, however only  worked fine on my HP computer after I re-set the International Code to whatever was recommended.  I shouldn't have had to do that, as this disk was not advertised as foreign-made, however it was a quick fix and disk is working fine on all machines in my home, so overall am happy.
THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY AN AMAZING PIECE OF VISUAL, EMOTIONAL, MUSICAL, amazing ACTING, ART IN THE MOST EXQUISITE FORM!!!!!  I CANNOT recommend this movie enough.  I saw this movie first years ago when it first came out in Miami.  When we walked out of the theater there were big tough construction guys walking out in stunned silence with TEARS in their eyes - this movie was THAT moving (but in a good way, not sappy), yes!  You could have heard a pin-drop everyone was so mesmerized.  DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!!  A true gem that went WAY under-appreciated at the time by most who didn't bother to go see it.  One of the VERY BEST Speilburg creations EVER, I would sincerely say in the top three.",1321228800,3,1173,4.490566037735849
