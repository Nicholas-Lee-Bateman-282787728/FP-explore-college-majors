8321561,2,B001MQD5YY,"This movie wasn't terrible, but it really isn't that good. either.

I found that is suffered from poor editing and poor visual effects that muddled the plot flow and confused it a bit. It was just difficult to tell where characters were located in the school. In one scene character may be together, only to chop away and some of those characters are also in another scene occurring at the same time.

It was just a confusing, gory, standard revenge/slasher movie.",1421452800,,464,4.716049382716049

8321566,5,B001MQD5YY,"A really good well-written horror movie. Korean horror never disappoints me!!
(Although, it sorta reminds me of SAW at some points)
Me and my friend watched it the night before our exams...not a good idea (I watched it again after that xDD)
If you love Korean Horror/are a fan of the saw movies: WATCH THIS!!",1341446400,,308,4.618181818181818
