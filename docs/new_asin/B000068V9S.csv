A little tad of science fiction, a few provocative settings, some great looking women, good acting, and some good overall scripts.  The price is cheap!  A reviewer above made a mistake.  The #1 episode, ""Caught in the Act,"" is wrongly decribed above.  It's actually the one with Alyssa Milano where a foreign entity takes her over and she becomes a very dangerous woman.  I've been waiting for some of these episodes to become available on DVD, and I'm not disappointed.  I forget how good the ""Valerie"" episode is.  My favorite episode, ""a stitich in time"" is on the other Outer Limits DVD featuring time travel episodes. I bought them both and highly recommend them!",1031356800,12,728,4.722222222222222

1) Caught in the Act - season 1 - A scientist's discovery falls into the wrong hands, bringing what at first appears to be a lifesaving miracle, but ultimately the premature death of his closest friend.
2) Valerie 23 - season 1 - Frank Hellner, a paraplegic, takes part in a top-secret project allowing a robot named Valerie, to be his companion for a week. The experiment goes wrong when Valerie becomes jealous.
3) Bits of Love - season 3 - Aidan Hunter might be the last man on earth after a nuclear holocaust in the year 2047, but he's not lonely. He has surrounded himself with family and friends. They are computer generated and controlled by Emma. He finds out that fooling around with Emma's feelings can be dangerous!
4) Human Operators - season 5 - Jack Noseworthy has lived aboard a ship, which is his master, as it floats through space. He has lived aboard this ship all of his life. Polly Shannon is brought aboard for Jack so that the next generation of slaves can be created. They both yearn for freedom resulting in a battle between man and machine.
5) Skin Deep - season 6 - Sid Camden uses a device known as an image enhancer and is soon out on the town with his new and improved look.
6) Flower Child - season 7 - A seductive woman challenges a couple's thoughts of
commitment and monogamy.",1029974400,24,1442,4.384328358208955
1728296,4,B000068V9S,"The best thing about this DVD is the interview with original series creator Joe di Stefano. Generously timed and very thorough, Stefano's interview features enthusiastic and lucid reminiscences about the old OL and also about the Golden Age of Television. He also wrote the screenplay for Hitchcock's Psycho. These credentials make him a true legend.

The episodes themselves are a mixed bag. No one would expect these newer productions to compete well with di Stefano's legendary originals, but they are largely disappointing. The theme of sex and science fiction keeps it all very interesting and salacious. However, sexy storylines don't guarantee very much replay value.

The most memorable episode is Valerie 23. It is a sci-fi reworking of Fatal Attraction. It features a good story and some very good acting by William Sadler and Nancy Allen. It also features some good special effects work on the android Valerie 23.

I also have to say Valerie 23 features a performance by an actress named as Sofia Shinas in the credits. However, she looks and sounds an awful lot like Morena Baccarin of Firefly and Serenity fame. Yes, her hair is red here, but you can't mistake that voice. She also appears buck nekkid, full frontal and rear nudity--twin peaks, bush country, and everything else. You'll have to watch the episode and decide for yourself about the true identity of Ms. ""Shinas.""

I enjoyed the episode Flower Child as well. It's not as raunchy as the others, but for that reason is spookier and more mysterious. The episode features a young couple whose fidelity is tested by an attractive female alien. My only complaint is that the young woman seems more faithful than her male lover. The male is approached by the alien with her special powers. The female ends up on a business trip with a very bland male co-worker. The male succumbs to desire, the woman doesn't. If the chick's co-worker looked more like Brad Pitt or George Clooney, this episode would've had a much different outcome.

Other episodes feature well-known actresses such as Natasha Henstridge and Alyssa Milano. Surprisingly, Ms. Henstridge does not disrobe though Ms. Milano does go topless.",1463270400,,2174,5.011080332409972

1728300,5,B000068V9S,"I received the box set in shrink wrap and upon inspection of the box, DVD cases, and the DVD's I found everything to be in mint condition as for the DVD'S and their cases and as for the box there was a removed sticker where the barcode is on the bottom. So simply put in my opinion this was like brand spanking new to me yet they listed it as used. The seller in my opinion delivered a superb product, especially for so called used condition. The DVD'S are double sided which is something I didn't know until I received it. I haven't watched any of the episodes yet due to school being back in session and 6 different major home improvement projects I'm juggling. This is the MGM collection I did notice on the DVD'S. I will see if this is the unedited versions or not, also I will see if these play any of the intro/outro's. I do believe the final season or year that the Outer Limits aired was on SCI-FI, now named SYFY, due to the show being canceled by SHOWTIME and then picked up for a single season by SCI-FI channel, and of course  there will be no nudity or vulgar langue in any of those episodes as season 1 to 6 was aired on SHOWTIME which did show nudity and used vulgar langue. This box set has 36 total episodes. The episodes, Patient Zero, Alien Shop, Flower Child, Time to Time, and Human Trials are all on the 7th season or final season, as some call it which aired on the SCI-FI channel at the time in 2001-2002. MGM's season 1, released in 2005, of the Outer Limits is unedited I do know because I do own that season but they never met expected sales and stopped production after producing only the first season.

1728305,5,B000068V9S,"I'm going to leave it to others to review the shows and how they have chose to release them (or not release them, but I did base my star rating on liking the shows). I am just going to review the technical formats of the DVDs. First off all discs are double sided discs. If you are like me and own a 301 disc pioneer and/or 400 disc Sony DVD changer you find this very annoying because you don't want to have to open your player and flip the disc. That kind of defeats the reason of owning a DVD changer. The good news for all with the knowhow is that the B sides on all discs are under 4.7 GB and can be copied without any quality loss. Side A on all discs has 4 episodes on it and is double layered, 2 have some extras. Side B has 2 episodes and extras and is single layer.

All discs on both sides have a jacket_p picture on them. The Sex & Science Fiction and the Time Travel & Infinity discs have a generic picture that just says The Other Limits. The other discs also say what disc it is and what side it is.

Now on to the pet peeve of mine, not one of the discs has tile text on it! It literally takes about 30 seconds to add a basic disc title to a DVD when it is being mastered. For people with DVD changers it makes it so nice not to have to type in the names of the DVDs. These are the first discs I have seen that have a jacket_p picture and not title text.

All episodes are 4x3 1.33:1 full screen. So there will be black bars on the right and left sides of a widescreen TV if you maintain the aspect ratio without zooming in to crop off the top and bottom of the image. That is as it should be since that is the original format of the shows. It doesn't have the DVD player subtitle function on the discs. But it does have the English closed caption (CC) encoded in the video that can be used by turning on CC on your TV.",1406505600,,1835,3.9142091152815013

this particular set deals with artificial intelligence, and the relationship man has with machines, and at what point do machines have a intelligence, or personality, or spirit?  As machines in our society advance more and more we humans form an emotional connection to them, as these episodes point out.

the episodes are quite varied, with some well-known actors in the roles.  Some themes also covered are alternate realities, relationships, an a alien or two thrown in for good measure.

The visual effects are expertly produced, these are movie-quality productions and the acting is excellent.  I especially like that the actors take the material seriously and draw you in by making you care what happens to the individuals involved.  Some of the episodes show what happens when mankind reaches too far into an unknown unexplored frontier of science, usually with catastrophic results, and other episodes show the greatness of pushing the envelope and reaching for the stars to discover news way to benefit mankind.

After reading all the enthusiastic reviews for this DVD I thought I would give it a try.  All I can say is UGH.  Great low budget/made for TV sci fi is almost entirely reliant on the writing in my opinion, but the six stories on this DVD were dull, dull, dull, and entirely predictable.  Good writing was definitely absent from these stories.  This DVD contains six complete episodes of the new Outer Limits series.  Judging from some of the other reviews, material that was edited out from the TV version has been included in this DVD.  I've seen a fair number of the old Outer Limits episodes, and I thought the newer ones would have some interesting sci-fi plot lines and interesting/unexpected twists.  None of the six stories held my interest, it was a real effort to sit and watch them even once.  I can't imagine that I would ever watch them again (i.e. I wouldn't recommend anyone actually spending money on this - if you are a real glutton for punishment, rent it before buying).  All six stories retread ground that has, in one manner or another, been absolutely beaten into the ground by previous shows.  I don't know if these six are representative of the series as a whole, but if they are, I can't understand why/how it lasted six or seven years.

1728467,4,B000068V9S,"I was afraid that these episodes would be banal and unimaginative.  No worries.  Surprisingly, several of the stories contained on this DVD are genuinely thought-provoking, and quite creative.

My favorite episode of this collection was ""Bits of Love"" in which the sole survivor of a future nuclear holocaust lives in a carefully constructed holographic and computer-controlled environment.  He can interact with the simulations of other human beings, including several ex-girlfriends, drinking buddies, his parents, etc.  Unfortunately for the protagonist, the Artificial Intelligence system comprising the holograms begins to act in unexpected ways, that are both plausible and thought-provoking.  This is a truly excellent story that technologically may only be twenty or so years ahead of our present state-of-the-art.

""The Human Operators"" is another quite good episode here.  In this story, the Artificial Intelligence systems of military starships have rebelled against the human crews, such that now each ship is tended by a single human slave, whom the ship (""Ship"") treats quite badly.  The ruthlessness and heartlessness displayed by Ship to the humans, and our species' inborn hatred of slavery, is the theme that plays out in this very well done story.

""Skin Deep"" is an imaginative and downright wierd story in which the protagonist gets ahold of a new holographic gadget that can cause one's appearance to be that of another human being.  The homely protagonist expropriates the looks of one of his better-looking co-workers, and the story revolves around the theme that we never really know what goes on in the lives of other people.  The episode also credibly examines the role that good looks plays in society.  An excellent episode with more than one twist that I will not spoil here.

The other episodes in this six-story set are pretty good, and overall this is an excellent value.  The theme of course means that this is not suitable for family viewing with kids around, but there is no hard-core material here either.  Most of these stories are surprisingly thoughtful, and often startling.  Recommended.",1192838400,3,2129,5.307462686567164

Why are they not packaged like they were screened?

1728518,4,B000068V9S,"I am going to differ with many of my fellow reviewers regarding the format here:  I have long enjoyed the series 'Outer Limits', both the old series and the new series, but was not sure if I would ever find the means to collect all of the seasons.  Perhaps it is because many of my favourite episodes are to be found in this collection that I don't mind the topical selection method, but it does serve to give a good overview of the several years of the new 'Outer Limits' series.

There are six discs in this collection, each with six episodes, arranged around a theme - transformation/mutation, time travel, android/robots, aliens in the world, death/afterlife, and sex in science fiction; thus, 36 one-hour episodes in all (well over a whole season's offerings).  My favourite episodes include 'I, Robot', starring Leonard Nimoy (derivative of an Isaac Asimov idea), 'The Grell' (which highlights issues of xenophobia and community inclusion in a unique way), and 'Human Operators' (with the voice of Malcolm McDowell, who gives a stellar performance without ever being on screen).

The original series of the 'Outer Limits' was a groundbreaking television production, testing limits and innovating ways of adapting to the still relatively new medium of television.  The new series has much better production values, but apart from the occasional nudity (which is censored for broadcast, but was preserved on the original cable offering and again on DVD format), the series is no longer an innovative one - most of the stories seem at home on the screen, and while they are interesting, they don't break new ground.  Perhaps that is indicative of how much both public awareness and entertainment has progress in the past generation.

Each DVD has extras, including featurettes for the episodes and a more general topical feature discussing the origins of the series.  The menu are user friendly and logically oriented.  The one drawback I have seen is that a few of the double-sided DVDs have problems playing on my DVD player some of the time.  There are skips, freezes and a few other glitches that occasionally (but not frequently) manifest; while pausing and repeating usually clears these problems, it is not ideal.  This has only happened on two episodes.

There are a few episodes I wish had been included:  'Origin of Species', the part-two episode of 'Double Helix', would have been a welcome inclusion.  My list of what I would also like to have could go on and on, and in the fullness of time I am likely to acquire the complete series (at which time this set of topically arranged DVDs will make a good gift for a friend).  Until that time, I am happy to have so many episodes of the series in this creatively arranged collection.

Really good collection!  The episode starring Alyssa Milano is dynamite!  I remember the first time I saw it a decade ago...

Valerie 23 and the flower girl episodes are delightful too!

The concept behind Valerie is scary...I hope man won't EVER try to ""replace"" nature!  As if the world wasn't messed up enough...!  It [the world] would become absurd!

The extras are very, very good.  Usually extras are OK but nothing to sneeze at...here, you get to know exactly what was in the back of the mind of the producers, directors, etc...it's great!

If I ever cross Alyssa in flesh & blood, I'll definitely get my copy signed!

The New Outer Limits series offers a variety of great science fiction plots.  However, when I buy DVD's, I expect to be able to collect complete libraries of the stories that I've come to appreciate.  This 'theme-based' release offers about a third of the episodes that I can recollect.

Showtime has aired other great science fiction plots such as Star Gate SG-1 (also adopted by the Sci-Fi Channel), and Jeremiah ([...]  I'm glad that Star Gate SG-1 is being published on DVD in its entirety, unlike Jeremiah.  Jeremiah aired in 2002, and was subsequently published onto DVD.  I instantly bought the first season of Jeremiah, but was very disappointed to learn that there would be no season two DVD release.  There was a great story-line, cast, and set, but Showtime and the parent company had some sort of misunderstanding, which led to the cancellation of Jeremiah and yet another great science fiction series (to-be) called Odyssey 5.  Odyssey 5 never made it past the first season and left its fans with the biggest cliff-hanger ever.

Getting back to the Outer Limits, there'll be a full release of season one on the first of November 2005; ten years after its premier.  ([...])  I'll buy the series once there's talk of the publication of the complete series (all six seasons); not just one.",1124496000,5,1355,4.843478260869565

1728524,5,B000068V9S,"When I first looked at this television series, I had no idea it was an old remake. That's how good it is. To me, it embodies the truth of simple morality without the general feeling of reluctance to mention such 'moral feelings' out loud or in public.

This distinction allows it to be safetly kept in the form of a media for inner scrutiny. The inability to speak the truth at the end, and the Control Voice is very appealing and uncertain. I find myself to this day disagreeing wholeheartedly with all that the Outer Limits has to say and being astounded at the same time with my inner recognition: that I am not alone.

In my discovery, I find that disagreeing with all of these episodes is better than shunning them entirely. How can you rate the quality of shows based on morality? Isn't it your imagination? For example, the ones on sex cater to women only. If you're a man, you need to learn to think like a woman. Women think almost entirely of sex as power, and to contemplate that in mysterious ways would make you very jealous. Jealousy is a powerful emotion. It is an ingredient to suffering. Can sexual attraction be suffering? The other aspects of these series is that they deal mostly with aliens or technology. If they had more subjects to deal with, that would open your mind, would it not? I borrowed these series from my local video store and have yet to buy them. I must admit, I will still say that even when I own them. It is like pure embarrassment that keeps me closer to the truth! I'd say that's well worth the moral investment.

Some episodes are pure fascination, some are mundane, but I've found I cannot stop thinking about these episodes! Even the most stupid ones like the sex ones with Alyssa Milano for instance have kept me captivated. There is a story about a man who invents a machine that once it gets activated will turn him into anything he wishes to be. This story continues forever. That's the synopsis for every Outer Limits episode. Before you watch this as a man, consider watching it as a woman who knows all and everything!",1121644800,4,2070,4.485411140583555

1728545,4,B000068V9S,"While ""The Outer Limits-The New Series"" had a number of fine moments, the series could be extremely inconsistent. The finest episodes of the new series could compare favorably to the best of the original show. MGM has chosen to release a series of themed DVDs as opposed to the entire seasons. I'm not going to dive into the controversay about the way this is being released but focus on the quality of the episodes, transfer and extras.

The weakest set is ""Sex & Science Fiction"" and played to the peeping tom in the audience by combining the science fiction elements of the original show with nudity and four letter words. The best episode on the ""Sex"" set is ""The Human Operators"". That's not to say that the rest of the episodes are particularly bad; they're not they just don't share the ""sense of awe"" of the original series. You do get Alyssa Milano nude though as a compensation for the guys out there.

""Aliens Among Us"" features a number of terrific episodes including the classic ""Quality of Mercy"". Robert Patrick plays a soldier taken captive by a race of reptilian aliens that Earth is at war with. He's put in with a cadet (Nicole DeBoer)who is gradually being turned into one of the aliens as part of some sort of bizarre experiment. ""Afterlife"" features Clancy Brown as a man wrongly convicted of murder who is given the choice of death by lethal injection or participation in a biological experiment by the military. He chooses the latter but doesn't know that he's being biologically transformed into something else. ""The Grell"" and ""Realtivity Theory"" both touch on a number of fascinating themes as well.

""Death and Beyond"" features a number of strong episodes including Alan Brennart's suspenseful and moving ""The Second Soul"" which has much in common with the best that Joseph Stefano, Leslie Stevens and Harlan Ellison contributed to the series. A dying race contacts Earth asking for help. They don't want technology; they want our dead. The aliens want to reanimate them with their own ""souls"". ""The Second Soul"" asks a lot of complex questions, addresses bigotry without a heavy handed approach and creates much suspense. The performances by Rae Dawn Chong and Mykelti Williamson are strong and Brennart's (who wrote some of the finest episodes of the 80's ""Twilight Zone"" and is a novelist of note)script touches on the spirit of the original show.

""A Stitch in Time""by Steven Barnes features Amanda Plummer as a scientist who is linked to a series of murders the oldest of which occurred 30 years ago only she was a child at the time. An FBI agent (Michelle Forbes) finally begins to put the pieces together when she discovers where the research led. ""Tribunal"" and ""Deja Vu"" both are worthwhile episodes as well. In ""Tribunal"" an attorney discovers a way to bring a Nazi war criminal to justice by snatching him from the past. Unfortunately, his decision has some nasty consquences.

""Fantastic Robots and Androids"" has a couple of wortwhile episodes as well. I wasn't impressed with the remake of ""I Robot"" from the original series but ""Glitch"" touches on Philip K. Dick territory in a story about a man who discovers he's an android designed to assassinate people. ""The Camp"" where the last humans are herded into concentration camps by andriods left behind from an alien invasion.

Each disc has a number of featurettes about the series with interviews featuring original series producer/writer/co-creator Joseph Stefano, producer/writer Pen Densholm who revived the series for MGM and Showtime. There's also documentaries/featurettes about various episodes as well.

The drawbacks are few but significant. The transfers here for many of these episodes contain quite a bit of video noise and the transfers aren't always the best either. The quality of the writing and performances make this worthwhile even if MGM has dropped the ball on many of these episodes. The ""Aliens"" set in particular has quite a few flaws in this area. A pet peeve of mine is when studios fail to put chapter stops after the opening logos so you can skip them  and get right to the episode. On the earlier sets MGM did a fine job with this on the later sets (such as ""Aliens"") they put the chapter stops at some of the most bizarre moments.

Overall, this is an exceptional series. It may not have been as ground breaking as the original series but many of the finest episodes were the equal of the best from the original series. Like the 80's version of ""The Twilight Zone"" ""The New Outer Limits"" may not have always captured the flare and power of the original but that doesn't diminish the importance of this series.",1119657600,7,4631,4.844500632111251

1728593,5,B000068V9S,"This DVD contains six episodes from the second science fiction anthology series called The Outer Limits (the first series aired 1963-1965 on ABC).  The Outer Limits television series aired on Showtime from 1995-2001 and then on the SciFi Channel from 2001-2002 (its last season).  The series was an anthology series because the episodes rarely had any connection with each other, though there were occasions when storylines carried over to more than one episode, though sometimes these continuations of the story came seasons apart (which is easier to see on the Time Travel collection of episodes).  I was unaware of the Showtime connection with the series, and had only seen episodes on SciFi, so this warning: there is nudity on four of these six episodes.

Special Features: On Side A: Outer Limits Story; and episode featurettes; on Side B: episode featurettes and ""The Outer Limits of Sex and Science Fiction."" (Don't forget to manually turn over the DVD or you will miss the other 2 episodes and featurettes (I had to physically turn over the DVD disc to see the side B stuff, maybe other DVD players can read both sides).

1) ""Caught in the Act"" - This episode is about a woman that is infected with an alien creature and finds herself with an uncontrollably need to mate (she had previously been ""saving herself"" for marriage).  She ""plays the field"" and absorbs her partners into her, literally.  The woman's boyfriend tries to help her.  This 1995 season one episode (number 17 overall) stars a more healthy looking Alyssa Milano (as Hannah Valesic; TV: Who's the Boss; Charmed), Jason London (Jay Patton; Movies: Carrie 2; Dracula III: The Legacy), Saul Rubinek (Professor ; who appears in several Outer Limits episodes; Movies: The Singing Detective; Rush Hour 2), Garry Chalk (Detective Barnett; Movie: Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2) and features Stephen Fanning (Karl; Movie: Father Xmas), Kavan Smith (Quarterback; Movie: Mission to Mars), Fred Henderson (John), Sarah Strange (Lisa), Shaun Johnston (Cop), Larry Musser (Clerk), and Garry Davey (Doctor). This episode was written by Rob Forsyth and contains female nudity. (4.34)

2) ""Bits of Love"" - This episode takes place around 2047 and is about a man that is in an underground bunker trying to survive after ""the bombs dropped.""  The man has turned his bunker into a virtual reality simulation, somewhat like those simulators in Star Trek (though in this particular VR system, the man has to get into a special capsule to be able to touch the other characters in the program).  This 1997 season three episode (1st of season) stars Jon Tenney (Aiden Hunter; Movies: Free Will 2; Beverly Hills Cop III; Lassie), Matthew Walker (Dad, Trevor Hunter), Sheila Larken (Mom, Francis Hunter; TV: Marcus Welby, MD; The X-Files), Steve Bacic (Griff Hunter; TV: Andromeda) and Natasha Henstridge (as Emma) and features Ingrid Kavelaars (Nicole; 1987 Miss Teen London; Movie: Dreamcatcher; TV: Jeremiah), Crystal Cass (Claire; Movies: American Dragons; Disturbing Behavior), and Brett Stone (Michelle; Due East). This episode was written by James Crocker (Twilight Zone; Stargate SG-1; Lois & Clark; ST:DS9; Simon & Simon; The Rockford Files), and contains female nudity. (4.34)

3) ""Valerie 23"" - This episode is about a man in a wheelchair that has been working on synthetic skin for a company.  It turns out that the company has been creating a realistic android ""companion,"" and the man is asked to test out the android.  The man is reluctant but eventually agrees to test the machine as he is lonely.  This 1995 season one episode (third overall episode) stars William Sadler (as Frank; TV: Wonderfalls), Sofia Shinas (as Valerie; Mary 25 in episode 4.15 of Outer Limits; Planet of the Pitts), Tom Butler (as Charlie; Freddy vs. Jason) and Nancy Allen (as Rachel Rose; Robocop; 1941; Carrie) and features Paula Shaw (Executive; Insomnia; Freddy vs. Jason), and Bruce Harwood (Technician, X-Files; Lone Gunmen; The Fly II).  This episode was written by Jonathan Glassner (TV: Stargate SG-1; CSI: Miami; The Invisible Man; 21 Jump Street), and contains female nudity. (4.35)

4) ""The Human Operators"" - One of the few episodes in this collection that I had seen before, but only on SciFi, where it had been heavily edited (despite the heavy editing, I was slightly annoyed when I saw the episode on SciFi).  This annoyance stemmed from the fact that I had seen previous episodes of this series on SciFi, had found them to be quite good, and praised the series to a relative.  The first, and maybe only episode that this relative watched was this one, which I watched for the first time with them.  I was somewhat embarrassed by the sexual nature of this episode.  Well, years later, I've seen this episode again, and find that it is actually enjoyable. The episode is about intelligent spaceships (warships) that travel the stars trying to keep out of detection range of humans (they had been under the control of humans, and only came ""alive"" while under their control).  These spaceships keep one human on-board to make repairs, and on occasion meet up with other ships so that they (the ships) can get their humans to mate to create the next generation of humans.  The humans are treated quite badly.  This 1999 season 5 episode (7th episode of the season) stars Jack Noseworthy (Man; Movies: Encino Man; Alive; TV: Elivs), Polly Shannon (Human Operator of Starfighter-88; Movie: Harvard Man), David Kaye, Noah Heney (Man's Father; Snow Falling on Cedars) and Malcolm McDowell (as the voice of Ship; Movies: A Clockwork Orange; Caligola; Blue Thunder; Milk Money). This episode was written by Naren Shankar (The Chronicle; Night Visions; UC: Undercover; CSI; Farscape; ST: Voyager; SeaQuest DSV; ST:DS9; ST:TNG)  based on the short story by Harlan Ellison & A.E. van Vogt.  This episode contains female nudity. (4.20)

5) ""Skin Deep"" - This episode is about a man, Sid Camden, that sees himself as being intelligent, but quite unattractive. Sid  works for a company that has come up with a new product, which he is allowed to test out in the world.

I hope they continue to launch other seasons on DVD and produce more shows for televison. I consider it better than twillight zone. I think outer limits is the best tv show ever made.",1114646400,4,275,4.2075471698113205
1728595,1,B000068V9S,"I so titled my review because I recently had a plumber out who asked what I wanted and then did it. He didn't do part of the job or any old job he wanted to and charge me the same. What he did was what I needed. He actually did more than I asked for the same price. We in the DVD purchasing public call such things ""extras.""
MGM decision makers, however, cannot seem to get up to the intellect of my plumber. What they are pumping our way is a diluted version of what we want. It makes as much sense - to put it in terms studio executives understand - as paying for 24 produced episodes a year and only broadcasting ten.
I'm not buying these. Though I love the series and have gone to great pains just to watch every episode and, in general, am a television DVD enthusiast having even purchased the ""Land of the Lost"" offerings, I'm not spending money to condone lobotomized thinking.
The only thing more disturbing would be if they were offering the censored versions.
Just in case MGM is reading this, you're screwing up. These will sell, but you've lost a huge chunk of marketing potential. Trust me, I know of what I speak. DVD packages of serialized television are a vein just beginning to be tapped. But loyal fans will not be toyed with. Doing so will dissolve your base like Alka-Seltzer in water. But, hey, why listen to me. I'm just a fan. With money. And once you lose your job, I can put you in touch with my plumber. I'm sure he could use an assistant with your ideas of how to pump out waste.",1113782400,38,1506,4.2508710801393725

1728597,3,B000068V9S,"I do not believe in reviewing something that has not yet been released, but I have to express my dismay that the release of these Outer Limits episodes is a strong indication that we devoted fans of the series will be deprived of full season releases, at least for the foreseeable future.

We are truly between a rock and a hard place. If these episodes sell well, then we are endorsing this method of releasing episodes by theme. If they do not sell well, then the danger is no more Outer Limits releases.

I can only submit this with the slight and vague hope that someone with some influence may read this and reconsider.

Not everyone is a fan of the new Outer Limits series, but I believe it was generally well done, at least when it was on Showtime. In a perverse way, the move to the Sci-Fi channel parallels the original series season two, where a new production team compromised the show, yet still produced some episodes of quality.

May someone please take ""Control"" of MGM DVD production and give us full seasons. I'll be glad to stand by.",1110240000,151,1051,4.486910994764398
1728598,5,B000068V9S,"The Outer Limits has always been my favorite Sci-Fi TV series. The original series ran for one and a half seasons in the early 1960's. You can get all of these episodes in two boxed DVD sets, made by MGM.  But why does MGM continue to ignore the 1990's series? They gave us this ""theme"" teaser, ""Sex and Science Fiction"" as well as ""Time Travel and Infinity"" on DVD, but as I write this, its been about two years now and no sign of a stubborn MGM Home Video Division releasing any more episodes.

What you might not know, however, is that there actually are more Outer Limits DVDs!!!  But you can only get them from Amazon.ca in Canada.  The Koch company, (not MGM) apparently obtained the rights to release the syndicated TV versions of parts of Seasons 1 & 2 and the complete Season Three so far.

The syndicated TV versions remove any nudity and four-letter words and have the fade-outs and fade-ins where the commercials

were inserted.  The first box set contains five discs and features only half of Seasons One and Two.  This set was released about a year after the two MGM theme DVDs, and avoided the episodes from seasons one and two that were already included on MGM's releases. It is somewhat hap-hazard since other key episodes were also left out. Then, in the latter part of 2004, Koch released the COMPLETE Season Three on a five disc box set!! The picture quality is just slightly less than that of MGM and there is a disclaimer about this at the beginning of each DVD, but I think fans like me will want to have these, and I'm thankful that Koch has taken the time and interest to provide us with these DVD sets!

It seems that these sets are not sold in the United States, as Amazon.com does not list them, nor does any other U.S. DVD store or mail order company.

So MGM: Wake-Up!!  Each season of the Outer Limits should be released in the United States and made easily available to all of the fans that want them!!

It is interesting that MGM instead chose to obtain the rights to the TV shows Mister ED (the talking horse) and Green Acres and have already released these full season boxed sets.  Do they really think there's more of a market for these somewhat lame comedy shows from the 1960's than the thoughtful plots, themes and subjects that The Outer Limits offers???

And if it is at all possible, Amazon.com here in the U.S. should take a stand on being able to offer these Canadian sets to their customers, especially if MGM is just going to continue to sit on their laurels and pretend that The Outer Limits of the 1990's doesn't exist!!",1104364800,18,2568,4.4594017094017095
1728599,3,B000068V9S,"The episodes on this disc definitely fall into the category of sex and science-fiction, but they're by no means the sexiest Outer Limits episodes when you consider the many episodes that comprise the shows' history.

Particularly during the earlier seasons there were some very sexy/sensual stories, but either the guys in charge of compliling this dvd decided it wouldn't sell well with mostly early episodes, or perhaps to keep them for other themed dvd's (because they centred on aliens, for example). But whatever the reason, it unfortunatley makes this compilation feel like below-average Outer Limits. And that's a shame, because while these episodes focus more on sex than anything else, they are very often short on plot and not as intense as the Outer Limits can be when at the top of its' game. So in the end, this offers mild titilation at best.",1099612800,6,856,4.944444444444445

I searched nearly the whole Internet to find episode guides and other information about the series. Today I have found out, that the copmplete series will NOT come out on DVD in our country.
Of course, the two Discs are not bad, but where's the rest ??
""The X-Files"" is also out there, but why not ""The Outer Limits"" ?
However, I'll buy the Original Soundtrack - that's enough for the moment.
And let us hope that at least the two DVDs will also come out in our language.

1728601,5,B000068V9S,"The original OUTER LIMITS series aired in the early 1960s.  It was often compared with its rival (and more popular) show, THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  However, there was a distinctive difference between the two shows.  TZ only sometimes had stories that belonged in the science fiction genre, while OL was STRICTLY 100% of the science fiction genre.
In the mid-1990s the show idea was renewed on SHOWTIME.  Being on SHOWTIME meant that the writers did not have to worry about censors.  So, what resulted was a science fiction show with a nice blend of eroticism.  The current DVD is 4 of the top episodes from the seasons on cable.
3 of the 4 stories deal with the concept of artificial intelligence, which is a ""biggie"" at this juncture as we stand right on the threshold of making AI a reality.  The fourth story is the most ""pure"" science fiction story as it takes place almost entirely in outer space.
From the eroticism side of the house, it is good to see that the nudity / sensuality is not contrived in the stories.  Rather, it follows along naturally w/the storyline.  For me that is the whole KEY to making eroticism ""work.""
The biggest names in the casting are Alyssa Milano, Natasha Henstridge and the voice of Malcom MacDowell.  The sultry Milano does a nude scene which is likely enough to entice a great many people to purchase the DVD.  Milano does a memorable job of going from the innocent girl-next-door to seductive vixen in World Record speed.
Although I have never been a huge fan of behind the scenes material on DVD, this does offer a decent package of the thoughts and perspectives of the creation of the storylines.  It also gives us some insight from one of the makers of the original OL.
If you like science fiction movies and short stories, you will like this movie.  If you like erotic movies, you will like this DVD.  If you like science fiction movies AND erotic films, you will LOVE this one!",1050710400,65,1916,4.597058823529411
