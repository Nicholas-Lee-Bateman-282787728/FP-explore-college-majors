3591464,5,B001G0MFQK,"I am a huge fan of SpongeBob, ever since it came on TV in May of 1999. Sadly, this set only contains half of the season.

My advice, if you are a big fan of SpongeBob, then I would buy this set and add it to your collection. But, if you're not, then I would wait until it comes down in price. The set may contain only the first twenty episodes, but we'll have to wait and see if I'm right. Until then, it is listed as containing twenty-four episodes.",1253145600,38,1335,4.761904761904762

3592499,5,B001G0MFQK,"I had never seen an episode of Sponge Bob. I downloaded it for two reasons: (a) to see if it would entertain my 6 - month granddaughter and (b) to test one of the Amazon Prime benefits. My granddaughter did not stay interested very long, but I thought it was hilarious! Now I understand why Sponge Bob is so popular.",1389052800,,316,4.283333333333333
3592500,1,B001G0MFQK,"My daughter typically watches some sort of cartoon from my Amazon Prime account, while we're on the road.  This particular time she chose SpongeBob Square Pants to view.  After hearing what takes place on the cartoon, just from one episode, I forbade her to ever watch it again.  I explained to her that SpongeBob's cartoon is bad for children.  I will later explain to her WHY it is bad for children when she will understand clearly.  She is three years old and knows not to watch it ever again.  Right now, she is only three and knows that SpongeBob is bad for her to view.

SpongeBob cartoon characters teaches children the seven deadly sins.  How?

Sloth - Patrick...He's lazy, no job and is awarded for being lazy.

Wrath - Squidward is angry all the time

Greed - Mr. Krabs wants nothing more than money

Envy - Plantkton is always envious

Glutony - Gary is always being fed

Pride - Sandy is always proud that she is from Texas and is a mammal

Lust - Spongebob is always lusting for someone

Whether or not the cartoon was created to teach children right from wrong, I do not recommend this type of cartoon for younger children.  Maybe it would be feasible for the ""Nick at Nite"" crowd.  But not for the daytime children network.

3592604,2,B001G0MFQK,"We are now advancing from teaching children about GLBT in to the next real of pushing sexual issues to be brought out to the public and in to the courts.  Sponge Bob, though with a male name, is as asexual as it gets, and I do not believe American children or the world's children need any more confusion than already exists.  Someday, maybe it will be romantic just to know about a thing called parents with shared but specific roles in the  family.  Would it not be just crazy to have a show where little girls got to be little girls in tutus putting their block dance stages together, and where little boys got to wear blue, wear firemen's hats, and Oh My God--To have a male partner going after bad guys, partner in work--That is.  We are already seeing the asexual cause with roots planting in the Bay Area, and most kids raised in these parts are not allowed to show their girly or manly sides without being chastised for doing so.  Please, can we ever have little boys at the fishing hole with Sally coming to chat with a boxed lunch and hating worms.  Oh no, we have to have Sponge Bob--The Asexual wildly crazy cushy non gender toy.  Thank you.

It eventually arived about a week after I ordered it. But as soon as I opened it up I stuck it right in the dvd player, and when it started I couldn't keep my eyes off the tv screen. It really amazes me how creative tom kinny and the whole spongebob crew are. I just wish they would make full seasons of tv shows. it seems like they stopped doing that to make more money... which stinksbecause not only is it more expensive for us, but it takes up more space if you get both volumes of eveerything. over all 5 stars!",1310774400,,771,3.9806451612903224
