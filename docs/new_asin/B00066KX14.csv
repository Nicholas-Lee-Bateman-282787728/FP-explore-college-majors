8039247,1,B00066KX14,"I bought this DVD for the lost archive footage and to see and hear the early works. There was very little concert footage and an endless  barrage of useless opinions from various magazine editors and pros. I was very disappointed at the choice of songs of concert footage also. You don't get a single song in its entirety. The early Ash like the songs from their first and greatest album, Wishbone Ash, would have better displayed featuring at least the song ""Handy"". Instead you get a very short outake of ""Phoenix"". None of their albums talked about gave any indication hardly at all of the true power of Ash. I give this DVD the proverbial 'thumbs down' a big 'strike out'. Not worth the purchase at the shipping price. One star. JW",1190332800,5,735,4.568181818181818
