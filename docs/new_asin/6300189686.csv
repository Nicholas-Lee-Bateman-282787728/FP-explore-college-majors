226846,5,6300189686,"Yep! It's Michael Dudikoff, Steve Jame (rest in peace,) and Director Sam Firstenberg at it again!
Did you love American Ninja? Me too! Then you'll love this not-quite-a-sequel to American Ninja!
What could be better than the 1980's Canon ""James Dean"", Michael Dudikoff kicking butt against a bunch of frumpy-dressed Marti-Gras musicians? Wait, they work for Pentangle?
That's right! Venture along with Matt Hunter (Chuck Norris? from Invasion USA???) as he takes care of your run-of-the-mill Average-Joe-bad-guys who work for the deranged Upper Class, radically political Elliot and as they turn Matt Hunter into Matt ""HUNTED!""
Oh wait. We have to give him a kid sister... Let's throw her in and then dub over her voice by some 30 something who voices cartoons. She's a weak little sister who becomes the bait that turns Matt against all his workers at the Agency. (What is that place, by the way?) It's like the West Wing meets Canon Films... (wait..)
Michael Dudikoff is a total BA... except when he's getting the crap kicked out of him. And Steve James (rip) is a giant hunk of a man who's running for SENATE??? CONGRESS??? He kills several dudes on that construction site. CNN would have a field day with that one.

I seriously don't know what it is about this film that i love. Perhaps it's because I was obsessed with American Ninja as a kid and Michael Dudikoff. The only thing that would make this film better would be Jason Mantzoukas and Paul from How Did This Get Made to review it. But ONLY if June was watching it too.
Love it or hate it, This delivers some awesome action and is perfect for an 80's Action Movie Marathon. Peace!",1473638400,,1642,4.7212543554006965

226896,4,6300189686,"The Movie: Retired special agent Matt Hunter (Michael Dudikoff) travels to New Orleans to visit his old secret service partner Larry (played by the terrific Steve James). Unfortunately, a secret society of racists that refer to themselves as ""Pentangle"" has it in for Larry and his family. They want to kill Larry and take Matt Hunter to the swamp so they can hunt him and test his skills, like in the classic story ""The Most Dangerous Game"".

This is cheesy 80s action at it's finest. The acting is good, not great, there are tons of bullets fired and martial arts action. The idea of a secret society dropping people in the swamp and hunting them is pretty terrifying. Dudikoff and Steve James were good friends when they made this film, and it shows. Spoiler Alert! One of them doesn't make it to the end, and it's heartbreaking because their friendship is real.

Also of note is the fantastic music by composer George S. Clinton (not funk Godfather George Clinton).  The action themes in particular make you want to hop in your jacked up truck and go jump bridges and take too sharp turns.

The Blu-Ray: ""Avenging Force"" just arrived on DVD and Blu-Ray last year; why it took so long we may never know. My experience watching this film was originally on an old CRT TV either late night on The Movie Channel or on VHS tape. In other words, I'd never seen it actually look good.

This disc is probably as good as it will ever be for ""Avenging Force"". Colors are decent and detail is pretty good. It's not intended to be a restoration or a reference disc; this is just a good transfer of an old movie. Honestly, I don't know if I want to see it any better, it seems like that would wreck the charm and classic 80s feel. The sound is excellent though! I heard sound effects and parts of the musical score that I hadn't with previous viewings on the old VHS.

Special Features: There aren't many here. There's a short interview with Michael Dudikoff where he talks about some of the production, the director and fellow cast members. It's nice to watch, I just wish it was longer and cut in on-set photos and clips from the film.

There is also a great commentary track with Dudikoff and director Sam Firstenberg. You get the feeling that these guys really like each other and had a lot of good times making films together. The commentary is really worth a listen.

Bottom Line: If you like cheesy 80s action films with heavy doses of violence, car chases and martial arts (and have somehow missed this film) then it's definitely worth a watch. Casual viewers unfamiliar with AF should rent.

Fans of ""Avenging Force"" who have been waiting and waiting and waiting for this release: This ""might"" be what you've been looking for. It's a decent package featuring the original poster artwork, the picture and sound are both solid, but the special features are lacking. I get the impression that ""Avenging Force"" will probably not have a Special Edition release anytime soon, so this might be as good as it gets.

It's not fine cinema, but if you like to see sweet lifted trucks jumping bridges and awesome Karate action in the swamp, this is your movie.",1427587200,4,3147,4.5836298932384345
226897,5,6300189686,"When the military needs Intel on someone they call in their top man, Matt Hunter. Hunter was one of the military's most promising young operatives who left the agency after terrorists killed his parents. It seems that Hunter has turned his back on the agency in favour of a quiet life on his ranch looking after his younger sister and their grandfather. Matt decides to take them on a road trip to visit an old army buddy Larry Richards and his family in New Orleans during the Mardi gras. Richard's who is running for a senate seat has been receiving death threats from a group calling themselves Pentangle. Pentangle is a racist organization run by a man named Glastenbury.  While riding on a float at the Mardi gras parade, Richards family comes under attack and Matt Hunter goes into killing mode. Can Matt Hunter protect everyone from Pentangle? Can Pentangle be stopped?  What other tricks do they have in store for Matt Hunter?  Id love to continue with more of the plot but then Id ruin everything!  I will say this, I loved the ending.

I was surprised to learn from the Blu-ray commentary that Michael Dudikoff began his career in comedic roles of all things and he wasn't really looking to become an action star. It's a good thing that he took a chance on the action gig because he was really good at it. His break out role was in American Ninja from Cannon Group in 1985, remember them?  The Cannon Group run by Golan-Globus Productions turned out numerous low budget action flicks throughout the 1980s and early nineties and Michael Dudikoff starred in a number of them making him a household name. If you're a fan of Hard Target 1993 and Surviving the Game 1994 then Avenging Force may be for you!

On to the Blu-ray from Kino Lorber Films. Im not familiar with Kino Lorber, so I didn't know what to expect when I saw that Avenging Force was finally being released on DVD/Blu-ray. After watching the film, I have this to say.  Wow!  I have never seen this film look or sound so good. Either the film negative was in great shape to begin with or Kino Lorber spent serious money on cleaning it up because its the best version Ive ever seen. The video transfer from Kino Lorber is outstanding to say the least. The picture is clear and crisp and the colors are strong and vibrant, I couldn't find any faults with the picture at all. As for the sound, I ran it through my home theater and I didn't notice any outside noise during the movie at all. If I can find any fault with this release from Kino Lorber it would be with the special features. I was hoping for more bonus content seeing as how this is the first ever release of this film on DVD/Blu-ray. That being said, I did enjoy the brief on camera commentary and comments from Michael Dudikoff about his friend Steve James who died in 1993 at the age of 41.

226924,5,6300189686,"This exciting revision of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) is edge-of-your-seat entertainment from beginning to end and is probably Michael Dudikoff's best film role. The film opens up with two Special Forces agents being hunted down by four masked killers in the Louisiana bayou. After the men are killed, we find out the killers form four points of the Pentangle Hunting Fraternity, a sick group of politically-connected thrill seekers who ""hunt"" people that don't fall into their twisted criteria of what's best for America. The leader of the Pentangle is Glastenbury (the late John P. Ryan, in one of his best villianous roles) and the next target is Councilman Larry Richards (the late Steve James), who is running for Senator and, since he is Black, makes him a target for the all-white Pentangle. They try to kill Larry while he is riding on a float with his family during Mardi Gras, but Larry's best friend Matt Hunter (Dudikoff), an ex-Secret Service agent turned rancher, is along for the ride and stops the assassination, but not before one of Larry's young sons is shot and killed. Pentangle, pissed that they missed their target, redouble their efforts and now have Matt in their sights, too. Their next attempt ends badly for more members of Pentangle, as Matt and Larry kill them on a docked ship and issue a challenge to Pentangle. Glastenbury accepts and sends his men to Matt's farm, where they burn down his house, kill Larry (with a crossbow bolt to the back), his wife and other son (both shot at close range) and kidnap Matt's young sister Sarah (Allison Gereighty). They make Matt play the game where the four members of Pentangle are the hunters and Matt is the prey. After Matt saves Sarah from a bayou brothel run by a transvestite madam, they must travel through the swamp while Glastenbury and his three masked cohorts are close behind. Matt will have to use all his Secret Service training, as he kills three members of the hunting party one-by-one, by impalement, crossbow and knife. Glastenbury gets away, but not for long, as Matt shows up at his home and they battle using the many weapons scattered throughout Glastenbury's well-equipped home. Matt wins and then makes a surprising discovery as to who the fifth point of the Pentangle really is.  Directed with energy by Sam Firstenberg (who also directed Dudikoff and James in AMERICAN NINJA a year earlier) and written by James Booth (who also has a key role as Admiral Brown), AVENGING FORCE is just one breath-taking action set piece after another. The Mardi Gras massacre in the beginning is one such sequence, where dozens of innocent bystanders, cops and members of the parade are gunned down, while Matt and Larry disarm and kill the assailants. Shortly afterwards, there's a stunt-filled car chase that ends on a docked ship, where Matt and Larry deliver their second beat-down of the Pentangle. Glastenbury gets so pissed off at the end result, he shoots fellow member Parker (Loren Farmer) in the gut for his bungling of the hit and leaves him on the ground bleeding and moaning as he walks away. There are also shocking bits of violence, such as the attack on Matt's house, where Larry, his wife and son (who takes a real nasty fall off a burning roof with Matt) all die horribly. John P. Ryan stands out in his role as a man with no conscience (if he had a mustache, he would be twirling it!), as we see in the finale when, even though he's been stabbed in the leg by Matt just a few scant hours earlier, we see him having a formal dinner with family and friends as if nothing ever happened. He is capably backed up by character actors Marc Alaimo and Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace as members of his hunting party. This Cannon Films production (Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were the producers) is one of their better films and will have you wondering why it is not yet available on DVD. I guarantee that once you watch this, you'll never look at the John Woo-directed HARD TARGET (1993) the same way again. Same location, same plot, same outcome. Also starring Karl Johnson, Richard Boyle and Sylvia Joseph. Finally available on Blu-Ray from Scorpion Releasing/Kino Lorber. Rated R.",1418169600,5,4175,4.766574585635359

The director of the such classics as American Ninja I and II and Revenge of the Ninja, among others. This is an amazing film. The only question is, ""Why in the world is this not on DVD or Blu-ray?""

226979,4,6300189686,"Avenging Force is the best of the Michael Dudikoff movies. That is such a low bar that a three-legged dog would have no trouble clearing it, so i'll qualify this review by saying that Avenging Force is a good, solid action flick in its own right.

The plot is standard revenge fare (it is called Avenging Force). An organisation of White Supremacists is causing trouble for Dudikoff's friends and New Orleans in general. It's up to Dudikoff to step in and use his two weeks martial arts training and fifth grade education to stop them. His boss offers resources and assistance, but Dudikoff wants to up his personal body count and duly refuses.

Avenging Force starts out following the standard genre tropes, but things quickly change tempo when some of the good guys start buying the farm. This film doesn't follow the standard rules regarding the family unit being off limits.  Kids, wives, late-night sneaky uncles and retarded step-sisters are all fair game for the bad guys and this attitude elevates Avenging Force above the standard 80's action fare.

If I have any criticisms of this film, it's that some of the action sequences are a little uneven. One sequence at a boat yard is particularly amateur hour. But this is Dudikoff and we all know that he can't go a whole film without reverting to the romper room school of fighting.

That said, there are other sequences that are expertly executed. The kid coming off the roof sequence remains one of the most spectacularly hilarious things I have ever seen. The bayou fight scenes, which are a cross between American Ninja and Deliverance, are also truly inspired.

The movie gets a strong recommendation from me. The Australian DVD comes with a menu and subtitles. There are no other special features to speak of, which is a shame, but also to be expected.",1365379200,2,1815,4.782747603833866

226981,4,6300189686,"Michael Dudikoff and Steve James reunite for the second time in this 1986 semi-sequel to Chuck Norris' 'Invasion U.S.A.' This time, Dudikoff takes over the Matt Hunter role, as he must protect his friends and his family from a group of right wing fringe Survivaists/White supremacists. This is one of Dudikoff's best roles, it's also perhaps the darkest action movie he's starred in next to 'Midnight Ride.' There are several scenes that will drop your jaw for the pure brutality and everything is played to the grittiest effects, with little humor. The main bad guy is awesome in this, he spends the majority of his time waxing poetically about Hilter while dressed like Hue Hefner in his bathrobe, petting a kitty. I half-expected bubbles to come out of his pipe.
Avenging Force is helmed by Sam Firstenberg, and he brings the same mixture of humor and over-the-top action to the table here as he did to 'American Ninja.'  It's nowhere near as over-the-top as 'invasion U.S.A.', but it's still filled with its moments of hilarity- people get shot and bodies go flying in weird contortions right out a Hong Kong flick, the baddies are dressed like they're going to the leather bar or celebrating Mardis Gras (it does take place in Louisiana).
Steve James I think was underused here. He's still cool as ever, and Dudikoff's bud, but he doesn't really get to show off as in the American Ninja movies. One great scene is where he's shot by machine guns and gets an arrow in the back and just walks away like nothing ever happened. I think Dudikoff has never been more convincing as a bonafide tough guy than here. He plays this mostly straight, and you can buy into it- whereas something like 'Moving Target' or 'Cyber Jack' would see him as an everyman goofball. He's still Dudikoff, and he still rules. And why there was no sequel to this, we'll never know. It practically sets one up to be made. I felt like I was watching a cliffhanger ending to a two part movie, but the second never came out.
