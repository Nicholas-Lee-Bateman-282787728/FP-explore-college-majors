8257031,1,B00151QY4E,"I liked Amityville 4 for what it is, and got this set for Amityville. But when I watched ice Cream man, I so had to sell this set and just pick up Amityville 4 separately. if you looking for Amityville 4, don't get it with this set, even if it's cheaper. pay for tiny bit more and get Amityville 4 separately. You don't want the other stinker in your collection, or to tarnish your Amityville movie from it being in the same set. I don't recommend this set unless you actually like Ice Cream Man. it is a stupid, corny, cheezy movie. 1.4 out of 5 for this particular set",1381795200,,570,4.1909090909090905
