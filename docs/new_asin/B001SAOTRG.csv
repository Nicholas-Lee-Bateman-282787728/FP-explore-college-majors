8339542,2,B001SAOTRG,"Packaging was subpar and the dvd was free floating in the case. This caused scratches on the dvd and the local used dvd shop buffed them out for me. The chain whip video was based more on performance than usage. I was hoping for something that taught the fundamentals and a demonstative form.

If your looking for a DVD that will show you a form with the chain whip, this may be for you.",1408320000,,387,4.22972972972973
8339543,3,B001SAOTRG,"I had to return this item twice since the DVD had scratches, the DVD layers disassembled or the DVD box was broken. Both the box ad the DVD are very very cheaply made. I couldn't read/view any of the DVDs since there were scratches all over the medium or the layers detached. In both orders, the DVD was freely sliding in the DVD jewel case/box which probably caused the scratches. For the price you pay its simply unacceptable to get such a cheap copy of DVD. I guess you may catch a good one but be prepared to return and reorder several times until you are happy with it. Since I cannot review the actual content but had such a hassle to order and receive a functional DVD, I can only give three stars here.",1378166400,,710,4.266666666666667
