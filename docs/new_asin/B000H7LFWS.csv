8137440,5,B000H7LFWS,"If you want 80s cinematic cheese at its stinkiest, ripest, most moldy extreme, ""Rockula"" is the movie for you. Still available exclusively on glorious VHS, ""Crapula""...sorry, I mean ""Rockula"" embodies everything you could possibly expect in a movie produced by Yoram Globus (Experienced B-movie fans, you know what level of quality to expect!) starring a young Dean Cameron as a rocking and rapping vampire who gets the hots for Tawny Fer every 22 years, but never gets past first base because she is killed every single time by a pirate with a pegleg and a hambone.

Go back and re-read that last sentence and ponder it before continuing.

Ready?

Ralph (Cameron) is frustrated by this multi-century dry spell and seeks a plan to win the heart of Mona (Fer) which is simplicity itself. She's in a terrible band and is in a screwy semi-professional relationship with creepy Stanley (Dolby) who is way, way over-the-top here. Stanley is thriving in both the music scene (watch for much of Dolby's work here, like the haunting ""Budapest By Blimp"") and as a coffin salesman, dealing in only the most unusual futuristic coffins. Ralph thinks vampires are simply misunderstood (he loves garlic, and I won't even begin to tell you what happens when he gazes into a mirror) and decides the way to Mona's heart is for him to start his own band and invite her to the premier. He's an instant A-list celebrity and his band, Rockula, is suddenly the bee's patellas, despite his lyrics being a cut below anything by Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett (OK, anything except the ""Climate Mash"", anyway.)

I was thinking ""Well, this movie certainly isn't very good, but I'm not sure that's it's quite as awful as I have heard."" Then at around the 41-minute mark Dean Cameron began a vampire rap. In his underwear. And the crowd went wild. This was the turning point in the film, and one that ensured its greatness in the pantheon of terrible movies with terrible music. Lots and lots of terrible music. All this exacerbates Stanley's controlling jealousy and appears to make his wardrobe depart the plane of the odd bound for a whole different dimension. After Ralph explains to Mona in a graveyard that she's actually 422 years old and that she dies every 22 years before their love can be consummated, revealing the awful truth that repetitively ""you are killed by a pirate with a pegleg, wielding a gigantic hambone!"" Because Mona is skeptical, Ralph proves to her that he's a vampire by turning into an odious little monkey-bat hobgoblin for a few minutes; this does not have the desired effect on Mona.

I'm sure you didn't need my title to figure out which cast member owns a rhinestone-encrusted pegleg, but before everything is said and done there is a ridiculous twist designed to confound young (old?) love that sullies the name of Phoebe (Basil) who, of course, dances in a ridiculous black ensemble and despite her conspiracy with Stanley in a wholly unnecessary, convoluted, and illogical turn of events, is immediately forgiven, while Stanley gets to examine the future of cryogenic technology. I know what you're probably asking yourself: is there a fight scene involving Ralph and Stanley featuring hambone versus pegleg swordplay in which Ralph has to yell ""That was my mother you just boned!"" in a reference to his mom, Phoebe? Yes there is. You'd think the film couldn't end with a more upbeat theme than that, but that's where you underestimate the wily prowess of a Globus production: Elvis, or a vague approximation thereof, makes a special guest appearance with Rockula to close the film out. When I say vague, think ""Dean Cameron in a jumpsuit saying 'thank you very much' with a sneer"". Semi-related side note: Bo Diddley is featured throughout this travesty for who knows what on Earth reason. Just sit back and marvel at the casting.

If you want to see a truly ponderous piece of intentional camp from the 1980s, ""Rockula"" could not come more highly recommended. Pass the garlic.",1433376000,,3978,4.859882005899705
