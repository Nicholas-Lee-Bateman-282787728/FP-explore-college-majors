4953683,5,B0064TLR1C,"Second Chorus (1940) is a Hollywood musical comedy film starring Paulette Goddard and Fred Astaire, and featuring Artie Shaw.. Nicely restored version by DigicomTV. Audio and visual quality are great!

In a 1968 interview, Astaire described this effort as ""The worst film I ever made"". Astaire admitted that he was attracted to the film by the opportunity to ""dance-conduct this real swingin' outfit"". In an interview shortly before his death, Shaw admitted this film put him off acting. Astaire and Shaw shared a striking series of personality traits in common: an obsessive perfectionism and seemingly endless appetite for retakes, profound musicality and love of jazz, personal modesty and charm, and in a late interview Shaw expressed his opinion of Astaire: ""Astaire really sweat - he toiled. He was a humorless Teutonic man, the opposite of his debonair image in top hat and tails. I liked him because he was an entertainer and an artist. There's a distinction between them. An artist is concerned only with what is acceptable to himself, where an entertainer strives to please the public. Astaire did both. Louis Armstrong was another"".

Danny O'Neill (Fred Astaire), and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are friends and rival trumpeters, with ""O'Neill's Perennials"", a college band. Both of them have managed to prolong their college career by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) catches Danny and Hank's eye. She serves them a collection notice for her boss, a debt collector, but the fast talking O'Neill and Taylor soon have her working for them as their manager.

Tired of losing gigs to the Perennials, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away to be his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaw's band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them both fired.

Watch the movie to see how it ends..... You'll love it! And so will the entire family.......",1390867200,,1940,5.053125

4953685,4,B0064TLR1C,"I love classic movies, especially musical.  This one was fun and light hearted, great dance numbers.  Fred Astaire and Paulette Goddard shine!",1390608000,,142,5.409090909090909
4953686,3,B0064TLR1C,"Fred Astaire's dancing is always a treat, and possibly the best part of this film was getting to watch and hear Artie Shaw work some real magic with the clarinet. However, the plot was even sillier than most films of this sort, and the vocal numbers were uninspiring.",1383782400,,267,4.583333333333333
4953687,2,B0064TLR1C,"Didn't finish watching it. Didn't feel any ""chemistry"" among any of the main characters. For me, that's the kiss of death for a movie.",1383523200,,134,4.625
4953688,3,B0064TLR1C,"That said, this wasn't a bad movie. The plot revolved around the typical love square shenanigans and all the actors certainly had screen presence, but the script just lacked any heart. The music was great, the dancing excellent, but without heart even the most talented people can't make a story work. The male characters are unlikeable, and Ms. Goddard is totally wasted in her role. Watch it for the talent and the music, but don't expect any warm gooey feeling at the end.",1381795200,,475,4.734939759036145
4953689,2,B0064TLR1C,"In fact, it may be his worst. Paulette Goddard is gorgeous, but they don't have much chemistry and she ain't much of a dancer. I love Mr. Astaire's work, and he does what he can but it's not up to his standards. Heck, Bing Crosby was a better Astaire dancing partner.",1355961600,2,267,4.254901960784314
4953710,4,B0064TLR1C,"I found it interesting to see Artie Shaw, Fred Astaire, Burgess Meredith and Paulette Goddard in one movie which is a lot.  It was a bit cornballish but it was cute. And you can definitely watch this one with the kiddies around.",1465257600,,228,4.428571428571429
4953711,3,B0064TLR1C,a little slow moving at times but the music and tap was nice. There is something about the older films that is fun to watch now and then,1458432000,,136,3.892857142857143
4953712,5,B0064TLR1C,Fun plot. Great movie for trumpet players.,1456963200,,42,5.142857142857143
4953713,2,B0064TLR1C,It was decent - good dancing. It was not spectacular like some other Fred Astaire movies.,1455580800,,89,4.625
4953714,3,B0064TLR1C,I have most seen of the Fred Astaire movies but this was new to me. Slow moving repetitious script and not enough dancing.,1453507200,,122,4.3478260869565215
4953715,5,B0064TLR1C,Great,1447977600,,5,5.0
4953716,5,B0064TLR1C,"Great music and cast in this 1940 classic.  It may be a ""B"" movie but the swing music is great, and naturally, Fred Astaire (who plays a musician) gets to do some dance numbers of course.  It's fun to see how everything turns out in the end.",1444176000,,241,4.1063829787234045
4953717,4,B0064TLR1C,Great dancing scenes and story line pretty good.,1439769600,,48,5.125
4953718,3,B0064TLR1C,"If you like old movies and Artie Shaw, you will find this enjoyable.",1439596800,,68,4.3076923076923075
4953719,5,B0064TLR1C,Fun movie and I love Fred Astaire dancing.,1438992000,,42,4.375
4953730,4,B0064TLR1C,Good,1438300800,,4,4.0
4953731,4,B0064TLR1C,Great music by Artie Shaw & his herd thoroughly compensated for well-worn 1930's plot.  Worth viewing.,1435276800,,102,5.375
4953732,3,B0064TLR1C,Fun movie to watch with an older adult who lived during those times.,1433289600,,68,4.3076923076923075
4953733,4,B0064TLR1C,I just love watching Fred Astaire -- not my favorite movie of his but still worth watching! -- great music by Artie Shaw band,1429056000,,125,4.25
4953734,4,B0064TLR1C,Anyone that enjoys the song and dance of the big band era will enjoy this.,1425945600,,74,4.0
4953735,2,B0064TLR1C,Fred and burgess are so adolescent you cant understand why paulette likes them.,1415404800,,79,5.153846153846154
4953736,4,B0064TLR1C,I will always love Fred Astaire. He is the best of the best. To watch him dance is pure joy.,1412121600,,92,3.65
4953737,5,B0064TLR1C,"Great movie, loved it.  so fun that Amazon Prime has this movie nights for me.  I thank you.  I remember the day when TMC had no commercials, I had so many VHS tapes recorded, they all went bye bye.  Now this service lets me watch all of these wonderful films again.  you have to sign up and be a prime member, plus you can invite 4 others to get the prime benefits of the delivery, but the main prime member gets the goodies!!!!  We all split the cost.  Its a great family thing to do for your family.  thanks again.... Prime I just love you.",1411776000,,543,4.104761904761904
4953738,4,B0064TLR1C,"Artie Shaw and band are at their peak.  Music 5 stars, plus you get Fred Astaire in a 2 star plot.",1401062400,,98,3.6666666666666665
4953739,5,B0064TLR1C,Astaire is always a treat to watch.  Things got a little silly with the two male characters acting like junior high boys.  But life was simpler then and the silliness added to the desired result- Fred got the girl!,1397260800,,214,4.461538461538462
8492974,2,B0064TLR1C,Didn't care for this movie,1485648000,,26,4.4
8492975,3,B0064TLR1C,As I watched this movie I realized that I am just not as entertained by stories like this as I once was. It is a good reproduction of the film however.,1483401600,,151,3.903225806451613
8492976,2,B0064TLR1C,Not the best Astaire movie. My husband and I love old movies and Amazon Prime doesn't seem to carry the better ones. Hope they add to the collection.,1483401600,,149,4.357142857142857
8492977,2,B0064TLR1C,"Fred Astaire's dancing and Artie Shaw's music were the only highlights of this film. Paulette Goddard was beautiful, but the plot was unimaginably boring and felt like you were drudging through the mud of its stagnant characters and exceptionally ridiculous scenarios.

Of all Fred Astaire's many talented works, this isn't one I would recommend.
Better stick to Swing Time, Top Hat, Easter Parade, or any of his other classics.",1481932800,,428,5.202898550724638
8492978,5,B0064TLR1C,Love the movie,1481846400,,14,4.0
8492979,4,B0064TLR1C,"Wonderful and fun filled romp. We need more delightful movies like this, today.",1480204800,,79,5.153846153846154
8492980,4,B0064TLR1C,"Fred Astaire even as silly as it was to see him playing someone in his twenties, was great.",1475625600,,91,4.111111111111111
8492981,5,B0064TLR1C,Fred Astaire is the bomb!,1473206400,,25,4.2
8492982,3,B0064TLR1C,"It was alright just to pass the time.  The plot/story line was not extremely interesting, and the movie just seemed to end all of a sudden.",1472947200,,139,4.346153846153846
8492983,5,B0064TLR1C,Loved it!!!! Very nice story. Love Paulette!,1468022400,,44,5.428571428571429
