6453201,5,B00KX459EA,"Wonderful story of extraordinary people who wanted an ""ordinary"" family and their journey to find it. Very we'll done and uplifting all along the way.",1413331200,,150,5.04
6453202,5,B00KX459EA,"I loved this movie. It was so beautifully done. So honest and real, following the story of a true ""Modern"" family and the struggles they faced to have, and raise their wonderful twin boys. I laughed and cried and I was so inspired by these men and their surrogate and how they captured over ten years of their lives showing the evolution of them wanting a child, to the challenges that came with it, being a gay couple, and how ultimately through love and courage they have an incredible family.

All the characters played by themselves were raw and vulnerable and I loved them all; Desmond and Curtis the parents, and  especially ""the boys""!
 I also loved Angela, the ""birth mom"" for her courage and honesty being in  a very difficult position when you're not the 'mom"" but you have carried these 'souls"" with you for nine months and are forever connected to them.

They handle this family ""dynamic"" so beautifully and it was a joy to watch.",1411516800,,942,4.583333333333333
6453203,5,B00KX459EA,"This documentary was outstanding! It's not only for people who have been through similar situations or are contemplating it...it's for anyone who loves LOVE. The vibrant ""characters"", played by themselves, make this story even more compelling and entertaining. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll just feel good about life after watching this amazing story of family, giving and unconditional love.",1410652800,,398,5.65

6453205,5,B00KX459EA,"This movie will change your outlook on life and love and family forever.  It brings a message of compassion and healing to an area of our society that cries out for change.  No matter your views on ""alternate lifestyle,"" the whole spectrum is compassionately represented within this story and you will find yourself nodding your head as you identify with one or another of the real characters within this life script.  With candor, innocence, passion and truth (and a little Deepak & Bon Jovi didn't hurt, either) this precious family invites us to take an intimate look into each of their life stories and experience the joy of being a Child.  You will laugh out loud, you might cry a little, but you will definitely leave this movie having experienced the absolute truth that Love is the common thread that binds us all...and the ONLY way to heal this world we live in.",1409875200,2,871,4.673202614379085
6453206,5,B00KX459EA,"Wonderful, moving story of the power of love and how a family is just that.  Love.  You will laugh and cry through the true story of this couple's extraordinary journey to family.",1409616000,,179,4.5625
6453207,5,B00KX459EA,"I loved this film for many reasons. Love poured out through the understanding of the real meaning of a loving relationship.
Gender was erased by caring and sharing goals, bias disappeared between the tenderness and the purity of happiness within this family. I have seen it three times and highly recommend this as a film in the direction we should all head for.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful story with the world.",1409443200,,421,4.780821917808219
6453208,5,B00KX459EA,"I laughed, I cried and I'm still thinking about the story of Two.  These beautiful, normal, regular people (as normal and regular as any of us ever get :))open up their lives to share their sweetest and toughest moments in creating their family. This movie could be a great conversation starter and healing tool for families. I'm thankful to have experienced it and will share with many others. (Btw the music is fantastic too!)

6453209,5,B00KX459EA,"Roman and Nyro, articulate and witty nine-year-old twins, share the story of their family in this touching documentary.  Starring the boys' fathers, songwriter Desmond Child and ""best mom ever"" Curtis Shaw, and their surrogate mom, with a fascinating cast of grandparents and friends in supporting roles.  It is difficult to imagine a more loving environment than the one in which these two amazing young men are being raised.  Wonderful film -- thanks for sharing your life stories with such honesty and candor.",1409356800,3,512,5.219512195121951
