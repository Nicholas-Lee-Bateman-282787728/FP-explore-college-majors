2727846,5,B000M4RG7O,"I love this show, and I remember the day the final episodes got announced back in 2009, I cried. It's such a great, funny show and perfect to watch on a Summer day or right before school in the morning. Honestly the only characters I really hate are Lee and Sarah (both have orange hair), I just find them to be mean/annoying. Here's hoping that Seasons 3-6 someday see DVD releases in America.

Season 2 is a great season and definetly worth buying if you've enjoyed the first.",1441152000,,478,4.431818181818182

2727853,3,B000M4RG7O,One problem I noticed on seasons 1 and 2 most likely Warner Home Video related a lot of the voices got cut out of the episodes like in the intro when Eddy says Eddy this tends to happens a lot on DVD players but works on my friend Xbox 360.,1411344000,,240,3.82

Ed Edd n' Eddy is such a good show. Its one of the last good cartoons to be on TV. hilarious, stupid, entertaining, clean, and just an awesome classic cartoon.

Recommend this all day. No question.

Just wish they had every season available...",1355184000,,272,4.625
2727859,5,B000M4RG7O,"Just got this the other day along with the 1st season. This is one of my favorite old cartoon network shows and it's great that the first 2 seasons are on DVD.

2727862,4,B000M4RG7O,"I watched the series when it first came out and always loved their shanagans. I looked around and saw what kind of seasons I should get and I decided to go with the Ed Edd n' Eddy series. I'm glad I picked my choice because on the second season they have many good episodes I cherished when I was younger. They give 13 entire episodes and bonus features! The reason why I give this DVD four stars is because the quality of the show looks like it's been rendered to a low quality, so they could fit a bunch of episodes onto just two discs. I really don't like and it bugs me when I see this kind of quality on an awesome series. They could of rendered it in a higher quality and put them on 3 or 4 discs, I really don't mind unless the quality is better. I recommend any one to buy these seasons because it was one of the best shows that came on Cartoon Network and they are selling it pretty cheap!",1313107200,,898,4.050561797752809
2727863,5,B000M4RG7O,"Epic yes! The Second Season is one of my favorites; I believe the show got better as time went on, although S5 was a little ""off"" at times. Anyway, some of my favorite episodes are here such as ""Mirror Mirror on the Ed"" and ""To Sir With Ed"". This show cracks me up and will always have a special place in my heart, and my DVD shelf! Amazon delivered it promptly and it was in great condition. I pop in a disc whenever I'm feeling low and it always manages to remind me of simpler times, and of course I'm in love with all 3 Eds and the unique writing and drawing style with a big heaping spoonful of personality.

The special features are pretty good too. I really enjoyed the interview with Danny; very in-depth and interesting! Not a fan of The Incredible Shrinking Day (which I'd already seen on YouTube anyways) or the HTD and origami stuff. Still, enjoyable and SOOOOOOOOOOO worth the buy! What a bargain! *insert Eddy-related scam joke here*",1306540800,3,947,4.442528735632184

2727866,5,B000M4RG7O,if you love them on tv you'll love them on dvd even more. Now you can watch ed edd and eddy any time you want. It's great.,1233532800,,122,3.5555555555555554
2727867,5,B000M4RG7O,"By season 2, the Eds had reached their stride. The animation is assured, the voice actors have grown into their roles, and the writing is solid. Although this set contains a few of my all-time favorite episodes, there really isn't a clunker among them, and how many TV shows can say that, animated or otherwise? Add to that the oh-so-weird, yet oh-so-wonderful music video for ""I'm Not Coming In [Anymore]"" (identified on the disc as ""I'm Not Coming In Today""), and you have a perfect product. As the Eds would say, ""Season 3, please!""",1223251200,,535,4.702127659574468
2727868,5,B000M4RG7O,I hated this show when it first aired on Cartton Network. Then I watched it more and more and came to love it. It is mindless fun that is just great. THATS MY HORSE!!!,1219622400,,167,3.9411764705882355
2727869,5,B000M4RG7O,The show is funny!!! My 11 year old and I watch it all the time. We laugh so much my wife yells at us to calm down. Got the 1st season too. Great stuff.,1210809600,,152,3.5

2727871,5,B000M4RG7O,"Hello I'm an autistic adult.

This is my review on Ed, Edd, N Eddy - the complete second season.

Great season loved it I have volume 1, volume 2, season 1, and season 2 if your a big ed,edd,n eddy fan than this is for you.

Plus there is bonus material that can not be seen on tv.

By this you'll love it and enjoy it.

Ed, Edd, N eddy fan all the way!",1199318400,3,353,3.7162162162162162
2727872,5,B000M4RG7O,"Have loved this show ever since it first came on Cartoon Network and loved the 2nd season on dvd.  It was great reliving those episodes and being able to watch them whenever i want.  I'm hoping to purchase more of Ed, Edd and Eddy on DVD in the future.  Great series and excellent buy on DVD less than 11 dollars...thats a great deal.  I'm happy it made its way to DVD and it is a pretty good transition as well, you won't miss a beat from the TV to DVD its all there for everyone to love like so many fans already do.  Excellent series & purchase",1191715200,,547,4.074766355140187
2727873,5,B000M4RG7O,My son had been looking for this DVD for a long time. He was so glad we found it.  He loved watching all the episodes.,1190592000,,118,3.72
2727874,5,B000M4RG7O,"From the day Danny Antonucci faxed the rough sketch of the Eds to Linda Simensky at Cartoon Network, this early '80s toon was destined to be a classic. Watch the interview with DA on this set and you'll see why. Briefly, this toon introduced the ""boiling line"" --the outlines are constantly moving. This was initially disconcerting to some viewers, but compare how tastefully nuanced is the movement in this cartoon with the overdone computerized camera used in many live action shows. I could watch this show all day because the character design and backgrounds are so incredible, comparable to early Hanna- Barbera or Peanuts in their restrained ""less is more"" aesthetic. Contrast that with the CGI music video on this set of ""I'm Not Coming In Today,"" where Sarah has lost all her ""Sarah-ness,"" and the Eds move stiffly. Yawn.

Need more? This is one of the few shows since the Simpsons to feature humans. Like Peanuts or Looney Tunes, it mixes fantasy elements with realistic ones. The shows are also longer-- two to a half hour-- than the HB three to a half hour format they otherwise reflect. DA, known for indie toons Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers Grunt, is the last guy you'd expect to bring the mix of subtlety and innocence that is the secret of every great cartoon, but the first guy who did. In the current animation glut, this secret has been forgotten in the rush to make everything ""extreme"", which is to say, as overdone and unsubtle as most current live shows. The answer of Suits (or maybe flannel shirts) is to make everything even more extreme in hopes of seducing viewers, a short- sighted strategy if there ever was one. No wonder TV is in trouble. Now, with this great deal on Season two (and Season one also available), this watermark of early '80s toons shows how great a cartoon can be. Watch the Eds, Grasshopper, and learn from the Master.",1179878400,6,1871,4.686930091185411
2727875,5,B000M4RG7O,"There's something about ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" that makes me laugh... uncontrollably.  Whatever the reason, I can laugh some more in the brand new second season DVD set !  Forget five or six stars; I'm rating this SEVEN stars !

Honestly, some of my most favorite ED-isodes are from the second season such as:

""Dear ED"" - Jonny 2X4 breaks up with Plank and the Eds help him find a new ""friend"" for him.
""To Sir With ED"" - Nazz comes over Eddy's house to babysit Eddy, who thinks it's all a date.
""Ready, Set, ED !"" - The Eds attempt to break a world record.
""Shoo ED"" - The Eds use Jonny's annoyance on everyone for cash.
""Floss Your ED"" - Single D has a loose tooth and everybody tries to pull it out.
""Home Cooked EDs"" - The Kankers vacation in Eddy's front yard.
""ED in a Halfshell"" - Jimmy becomes Eddy's protege in scheming.
""One + One = ED"" - The Eds enter a parallel universe they've taken apart.

Along with some of these great ED-isodes are some greater special features.  They include an in-depth and very informative interview by creator Danny Antonucci, a ""How to Draw Ed"" feature, two never-before-seen promo spots, and a music video entitled ""I'm Not Coming in Today""; better known as ""The Incredible Shrinking Day"".  (I knew it !)

Although I'm a tad bummed that Cartoon Network has officially announced the Eds' series finale recently, I won't be too bummed if I keep on buyin' the DVD sets so I can laugh on and on again and again whenever I want to.  Hope you do too.  And while we're at it, I hope season three is in the works !",1177372800,22,1542,4.322916666666667
