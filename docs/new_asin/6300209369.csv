230934,2,6300209369,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE MEDIOCRE SERIALS. IN A FINAL ATTEMPT BY REPUBLIC STUDIOS TO REGAIN ITS POPULARITY, THEY RELEASED THIS 12 CHAPTER SERIAL ABOUT A MARTIAN [LEONARD NIMOY, IN HIS FIRST ROLE] WHO EMPLOYS TWO GANGSTERS TO BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB SO HE CAN BLOW UP THE EARTH AND IT'S UP TO AN AGENT WITH A ROCKET SUIT TO FLY IN AND INVESTIGATE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. OCCASIONALLY INTERESTING [MAINLY BECAUSE WE GET TO SEE LEONARD NIMOY, PRE-STAR TREK] BUT THE EXCITEMENT WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE. MOVIE SERIALS HAD ITS TIME [WHICH WAS THE 30'S AND 40'S] AND THEY CAN NEVER BE BOUGHT BACK.

I was particularly partial to  the period office chairs with rollers the rockets come equipped with, sure  made it easy to play along as a kid.
Anyway it is worth the admission fee  on a rainy weekend day with the kids!",964310400,2,409,4.561643835616438

230937,3,6300209369,"In 1952, Republic Pictures was struggling. Their famous ""movie serials"" were losing attendence and fans to the new medium of television.  Trying to cash in on the sci-fi craze, Republic presented one of the final movie serials  ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE Starring Judd  Holdren, Lane Bradford, and in his first role... Leonard Nemoy,  This  serial tells the story of a diobolical ailen trying to create an H-Bomb  explosion to blow Earth out of it's orbit so his planet can take it's  place.  Only Larry Martin can stop him, with the aid of his amazing  rocketpack.
 This serial takes advantage of Republic's greatest reasouce,  Stuntmen and special effects.  Larry Martin and his rocketsuit flying  through the air is really little mroe than a dummy on wires.  This classic  matinee serial has been colorized and slightly edited to create an amazing  improved version of this crazy sci-fi classic. After all, Green Faced  Martians in Purple Suits in a Pink rocketship, It's hard not to have fun!  If you're looking for a fun nostalgic trip into the past, you can't go  wrong with ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE.",961459200,10,1110,4.934782608695652

Watch for a young Leonard Nimoy in one of his earlier roles.  The sound and picture quality on this Cheezy Flicks release are outstanding.  Highly recommended for serial buffs.

FYI, I bought this from Cheezy Distribution via Amazon along with several other titles because they offered the best price, and they refunded me more than 90% of the system-generated per-title shipping costs, only charging me what it actually cost to ship the DVDs.  For the volume of titles I bought, purchasing them at a lower price from Cheezy and paying only five bucks to ship the lot was a far better deal than buying the DVDs at a higher list price from Amazon to get the free-shipping-over-$35 deal.",1433894400,,824,4.85

It's a bit strange to see a very young Leonard Nimoy playing one of the ""bad guys"", but as it turns out, he's not really that bad.  This is a classic Republic serial, complete with cliffhanger endings where you just know the hero made it safely out of the danger.  Even though I only gave it four stars, it's still worth a bowl of popcorn and a two liter bottle of pop for a pleasant loaf on the sofa!",1405123200,,530,3.925233644859813

231215,3,6300209369,When I was a kid we lived to see the weekly serial playing on Saturdays.  They were a must see.  Now I view them with nostalgia and notice the many technical errors we didn't notice when we were young.  Still they are fun to watch.  They bring back many memories of the good old days when things were less complicated.,1404000000,,318,4.25
231216,5,6300209369,"As a kid in the 50's and early 60's, we had second run movie double headers for our Saturday matinee's.  They started with cartoon's and between the features, they would show the old Republic and other serials-all great fun.  Especially here-as ""Zombies"" are NOT the walking dead-instead, they are from Mars!  For those who like film history, these old serials laid out the format for the TV series to come.  Plus, this is the third film role for Leonard Nimoy...all in all, GREAT FUN!",1402963200,,485,4.738095238095238
231217,2,6300209369,"Boy, does this stink! This is supposed to be one of Leonard Nimoy's first roles--Couldn't make it that far. I guess if I die and go to hell, Satan will show me the rest of this crap. This reminds me of the old 50's Dumont TV show ""Space Patrol""-very little of it makes any sense and it contains a semi-western element for no apparent reason. The story is as clunky as the flying suit-about a bunch of Martians trying to save their own planet from destruction, by replacing Earth in its orbit. Also slightly resembles a totally humorless ""Men In Black""--feds in nondescript dark suits vs. space aliens. This is one of the last theatrical serials, and maybe the worst of the lot. Background music seems to be lifted from other serials. It is a fairly good print, at least.",1401926400,,770,4.507142857142857

231279,5,6300209369,I used to watch this serial on Saturday mornings as a child. It really got me interested in sci-fi. Love it,1390003200,,107,4.142857142857143
231280,5,6300209369,"I was 6 years old when I first saw Zombies of the Stratosphere at the La Brea theater in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles for 12 consecutive Saturday Matinee shows and it still rocks. What makes it even more enjoyable I now live 12 minutes away from Vasquez Rocks off the 14 Freeway near Acton, California where a lot of this and other classic Republic Serials were shot.

I always liked Republic's Rocket Man character and add to this a pre-nose job Leonard Nimoy as the young Martian Zombie and this really becomes classic sci-fi. looking at the serial as an adult and not a kid hasn't cramped by enjoyment either, but I do get a kick out of the line ""Calling the Rocket. Larry Martin's Rocket"". Like who else's rocket would they be calling? Of course this might have had to do with 1952 FAA Regulations regarding proper procedures for self owned space ships.

So step back in time to an era when imagination took flight and it was possible for a Martian Zombie to build an H-Bomb in an abandoned Mine that was located on the specific spot needed to move the Earth out of its orbit so Mars could move in. Please don't think to much and just enjoy the ride.",1389571200,2,1161,4.395348837209302

231282,5,6300209369,"Excellent condition.  I collect old Sci Fi movies and I already have King of the Rocket Men and Radar Men from the Moon.  These are serials consisting of 12 short chapters in each of the three sets.  A chapter was originally shown in theaters before the main feature so you would have to catch next week's show to find out what happened.  Each ended on a cliff hanger that was impossible to escape, except that they did - every week.  I was only missing a good print on this one and now I have it.  This one in particular is of interest with Leonard Nimoy as one of the aliens! Corny - Absolutely, but good fun.  See if you can count how many times the bad guys throw their guns when they run out of bullets.",1388966400,,708,4.161764705882353
231283,5,6300209369,"I really enjoy this movie. When I watch this movie, I can't help but think that this and many other Sci-fi movies made during this time period represent an evolution in action movies going from cowboy movies to science movies. These were made during the period of development of nuclear weapons and the Space Race between the USA and Russia. It's fun to watch.",1388793600,,360,4.640625
231284,5,6300209369,Great 50's sci fi entertainment. I watched all 12 episodes in one sitting. Got a kick out of seeing Leonard Nimoy in one of his first acting jobs I'm sure.,1388016000,,155,4.2
231285,3,6300209369,"There must have been a rewrite during the making of this serial.  Chapter 10 recaps the first two cliffhangers, then the Martian robot that was ordered dismantled is now propped back up in the same position in the lab and written into Chapter 11.  And why would Nimoy's Martian character have any motivation to warn the hero about the h-bomb that is about to explode at the end of the final chapter?  Having him gloat about it instead, or giving the doctor a better death scene, could have handled that better.  I know the serials shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I appreciate a little consistency.",1383350400,,603,4.660377358490566
231286,5,6300209369,I saw these episodes as a child on our black and white sometimes snowy TV and enjoyed them. If you want to see special effects and story lines of the 1950's buy this DVD. Get ready for a delightful trip into the past.,1378771200,,217,4.069767441860465
231287,5,6300209369,"Great Republic Studios serial from the golden age.  Forget the story, just enjoy the campy fun.  Back in the day, Republic Studios was known for putting out the best, rowdiest, and most fun ""chapter plays.""  Recommended.",1376438400,,220,5.055555555555555
231386,5,6300209369,"Zombies of the Stratosphere was very entertaining! If you're looking for a  relaxing, lengthy Sci-Fi serial, this delivers!!! Leonard Nimoy and Aline Towne are both cast in it. It uses the same music, rocket ships and rocket suit as Radar Men from the Moon. Thoroughly enjoyable!!!",1374883200,,281,5.108695652173913
231387,5,6300209369,"Yeh I know some think this sort of stuff is corny but there's a lovable quality about that soft black and white that warms my heart like visiting with an old friend.  Not only does it remind me of simpler times in our country, but in my own life as well.  Special effects are quite good considering the budget these guys had to work with.  And what could be better than to see how a major movie star like Leonard Nemoy (Mr. Spock)  got his humble start in sci fi. I looked forward to each individual chapter, feeling safe in the fact that our heroes and their enemies would again be slugging it out on the big screen, only to meet again later in the next episode.

231388,5,6300209369,"Old time movie serial madness at it's best.  Grew up with these at the Saturday Matinees. Spend all day at the movies for two bucks, those were the good old days.  Sure they were cheap and quickly made with sets and effects we laughed at even then.  That's what made (and still makes) them fun.  As an aside, this was Leonard Nimoy's first credited screen role.  Wooden acting and almost no dialog, he has come a long way.  May these movie time capsules never die!!

Quality of transfer and sound good considering the paucity of masters available.",1367452800,,547,4.577319587628866
231389,4,6300209369,"you can't pass up plotting martians if you get the chance no matter what form of takeover they choose.  it is nonviolent.  and there are no zombies.  that's the fifties trying to sound exciting.  they're martians.  and that's a classic formula!  it is a decent serial for people who really like movie serials a lot.  it's back and forth.  lane bradford is the subdued martian leading the takeover.  he was in lone ranger a number of times.  leonard nimoy makes his debut here.  he is a henchman.  he has a brief monologue toward the end that is nice.  you'll have to hang in there until then if you want to hear him speak more than a phrase!  the martians wear hooded uniforms so you can only see his face, but his face looks more babyfaced than on star trek with shatner so it is kinda neat to see him that way.  you get to see him 15 years younger here.  judd holdren is in this one as the good guy rocketman. later you will see him as a rocketman again in commando cody: skymarshal of the universe.  i liked that one and thought was a decent one that was underrated.  Roy Barcroft is also in this but is uncredited.",1367280000,4,1118,4.267942583732057
231390,4,6300209369,"This was a hoot to watch.  I rented this so I could see early Leonard Nimoy, it is ironic his character is dry and his ears are covered.  I could go on and on about the many facets of special effects of the time.  But you watch it and enjoy.",1365465600,,241,3.78
231391,4,6300209369,"It took me a while for me to get around to getting this one because there was so many other serials that caught my attention. This serial I kinda expected it would be... Lots of action, but short on substance. Not much to hold your attention on. Sure it's got a shoe string budget, but much better serials was made with that same amount of money.
  In all honesty I only got this serial just to add to my collection. That's all. It really wasn't the best serial ever produced, and it really was sorta dull. But for those who wants to witness the end of the movie serials, get this one... and while you're watching it...wear black.",1361664000,,630,4.330508474576271

231393,5,6300209369,"Although the so-called Serial turned out to be a 2 hour edited version of the original, it was nevertheless a great movie to watch.

231516,5,6300209369,"The description on this video says EP, which must mean speed, but I'm sure these are SP speed, as is my copy.  All of Republic's colorized movies are the same.  That said, I always want to see the full length version of any serial, but this one is an exception to that rule.  Republic was right on by putting out this shorter, more abridged version, for one big reason.  Boring in spots.  The cliffhangers are all here, and also the chapters.  It's just like the full version, only a little cut in between, which doesn't hurt this movie at all.  It's colorized beautifully, by the way.  The problem with the long version is that these Martians can breathe underwater, and since they are building this bomb in a well, in a cave, there is an interminably long amount of time spent showing them going underwater in this well.  I guarantee that you will eventually be fast forwarding through these scenes if you are watching the long version.  The flying scenes have been recycled from earlier serials, but the additional colorization makes them the ones to keep in your collection.  The video quality is superb also, unlike some of their other colorized movies.  The long version, I give 3 stars, this one I give 5 stars.",1334016000,,1218,4.613953488372093

231518,1,6300209369,"When I received this DVD, I was not impressed, The cover art work was cheesey, and the video itself was just as bad. What a disappointment. I returned it without hesitation.  I had this title on VHS tape and thought I would upgrade to DVD.  I will never purchase another DVD from this company.  For the price it is junk.  It is sad because these old serials are great.  I would suggest shopping somewhere else for this DVD.",1331683200,3,423,4.371794871794871
231519,5,6300209369,"This serial is very good if you're a fan of early 50's (and 40's) serials. Commando Cody is hard at work saving the Earth from alien invasion. He has the technology to do it. Will he save us? Leonard Nimoy is a [minor] bad guy in this one, so it won't be easy.

These serials are easy to get hooked on; you have been warned.",1324684800,,324,3.9846153846153847
231520,5,6300209369,Zombies was done at the end of the serial movie era and it shows.  This is one of the best serials I've seen.  There are none of the cookie cutter plots of the earlier ones.  The plot moves evenly and the episode endings seen natural and not contrived.  Definitely one of the best.,1322092800,,281,4.245283018867925
231521,5,6300209369,"Zombies of the Stratosphere (Republic Studios, 1952) was the second serial featuring the popular new hero ""Commando Cody"" alias ""Rocketman"". The fist serial (With the introduction of  Rocketman) was titled ""King of the Rocket Men"", and the third installment was ""Zombies of the Stratosphere"". What made the character unique was his ability to use a rocket powered flying suit to stop crime and to protect earth from  evil forces from space. Zombies of the Stratosphere dealt with our hero preventing Martian invaders from using a hydrogen bomb to blow Earth away from the Sun so that Mars can take its orbital place. Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek fame) plays one of the three Martian invaders, Narab. I like all three serials of this making frankly because the character potrayed is so cool. I can find no wrong in these serials and I thnk some critics over kill the review of these serials. The special effects were done superbly in the days they were produced. I have often wondered why the production companies don't produce another feature film using the original flying suit produced in the serials indicated.

Zombies of the Stratosphere was budgeted at $172,838 although the final negative cost was $176,357.
Larry Martin (Commando Cody) played by Judd Holdren, and Sue Davis (Aline Towne). All the special effects in Zombies of the Stratosphere were produced by the Lydecker brothers(Exclusive to Rebulic Effects team. The film is presented in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and The disc includes a trailer for Zombies of the Stratosphere. These serials were an influence for The Rocketeer movie. This serial is very watchable and it will hold your interest. It's a fun movie and a good film to watch to escape everyday life. I gave it five stars for acting, plot, and originality. Enjoy.

231522,5,6300209369,I saw this on TV as a kid and have always had a soft spot for the cheesy plot and clumsy dialog. This set is a good transfer.,1267920000,17,125,3.5
231523,5,6300209369,"First, a note.  ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE marked the science-fiction film debut of actor Leonard Nimoy.  He plays Narab - one of the Martian ""zombies"" - and actually has a few lines in the film.  I was kind of surprised Amazon didn't list him as an actor - since Nimoy's presence might actually lend to increased sales of this DVD set.

In the space of three years (1949-1952), Republic Pictures put out 3 ""rocket man"" serials - all using the same rocket suit for the hero.  Only the hero's identity changed.  The first of the 3 was KING OF THE ROCKET MEN - starring Tristram Coffin as the hero in the suit, Jeff King.  Then came RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON - starring George Wallace as the hero in the suit, Commando Cody.  Finally, six months later, came ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE - starring Judd Holdren as the hero in the suit, Larry Martin.  All three are worthy serials and all deserve recognition.  But only 1949's KING OF THE ROCKET MEN episodes achieved after-market success - later compiled into a standalone film release titled LOST PLANET AIRMEN, released in 1951.

EDIT - Originally, I said that 1952's RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON was turned into a 1953 TV series titled COMMANDO CODY - SKY MARSHALL OF THE UNIVERSE.  Not true.  While the ""Commando Cody"" name made the transition to the series, the part of Commando Cody was played by Judd Holdren (Larry Martin in the ZOMBIES serial) and the story line was significantly different.  Thanks to George Fergus who pointed that out in his comment.

The plot of ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE, even now, could be believable.  An alien race (Martians) is dying and their planet is slowly becoming unable to support life.  To remedy this, the Martians come up with a delicate but ingenious plan.  At a certain time during Earth's rotation around the Sun, the Martians discovered that they could ""blast"" the Earth out of its orbit - and move Mars into Earth's place.  To do this, they need to place a super-powered hydrogen bomb at a strategic point - detonating it at a precise moment.

Unfortunately for them, a group of scientists (Larry Martin, in particular), has become curious about certain crimes perpetrated in order acquire the material to build the bomb.  And he, and his rocket suit, are on the case.

All 3 serials were made available on VHS years ago.  The first 2 are already available on DVD.  This release of ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE completes the process of putting good quality DVDs of all these serials in the public's hands.  If you're a fan of Republic serials (or the ""rocket man""), I urge you to get all three serials on DVD.  You'll enjoy all three immensely.",1250208000,72,2636,4.651515151515151
