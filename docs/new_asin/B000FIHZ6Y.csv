8123106,5,B000FIHZ6Y,"Yep, the Best FuManChu. All come with english audio and German subs. You can switch off the German subs any time. Nice reproduction, good video (DVD) quality. I would sure let Lin Tang spirit me away anytime she feels like, LOL. Did you know that Tsai Chin plays Melinda May's mother in Marvel's Agents of SHIELD on TV? Yep, after doing her father's bidding's for so long, Lin Tang turned CIA informant/undercover agent. Rumor has it she was the one who had the idea for the Black Widow program in the first place.",1444867200,4,514,4.537634408602151
