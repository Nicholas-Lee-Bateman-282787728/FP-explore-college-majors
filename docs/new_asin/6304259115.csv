844134,5,6304259115,"One of the most definitive films of the decade! Dave Paymer plays Everyman (not literally, actually just Daniel Miller) trapped in the most perilous position possible- the carpool. The children, representing children (in a  wry twist, not unlike a rye twist, but fewer calories), drive him to the  brink of buying danishes, when his life is changed forever by Franklin  Laszlo (Tom Arnold in a subdued yet mediocre portrayal.) Miller finds  himself while dodging meter maids, hiding in a frozen foods  delivery  truck, and driving through a mall. Featuring Tony Danza as Tony.",913939200,,576,5.139784946236559

844332,5,6304259115,"Pretty good lighthearted movie. It seems like they may have had a small production budget, or inexperienced staff due to some errors that made it past post production. However, the movie itself makes it fairly easy to look past that.",1431129600,,233,4.85
844333,5,6304259115,I saw this years ago and laughed so hard. I went looking for it because I wanted to see it again. It was quite sweet and funny with an intriguing plot. I was astonished to read that it had received poor reviews and poor box office - maybe the publicist mucked up the promotion. It's a beaut movie and fun for the whole family.,1430352000,,326,4.109375
844334,5,6304259115,Great movie!  Brings me back to the 90s.,1428969600,,40,4.0
844335,5,6304259115,"this is one of those simple comedy movies, but it's great at keeping my attention and having me enjoy the movie as a whole. it stars tom arnold as a simple but funny guy who winds up taking a hostage (david paymer as a workaholic father) when he badly tries to commit robbery and he ends up stealing his van that's full of kids for the carpool lol. so what follows is a long day of various hijinks lol, with a couple bad cops on their tail who take their jobs too seriously lol. all the while, david paymer is obsessed w/ still somehow getting to do his job's presentation on time.",1426291200,,581,4.196428571428571
844336,3,6304259115,Carpool was funny and a different kind of story. Four people in a car pool pick up a bag of money that has fallen from an armored vehicle and have to decide what to do with it. Earnest Borgnine arrived late in the film but was well worth the wait. Nice silly comedy.,1425945600,,266,4.037735849056604
844337,4,6304259115,Pretty funny bit of fluff to help pass an evening at home. Be sure to make some popcorn to go with the corn!,1425081600,,108,3.739130434782609

844422,5,6304259115,"Just a fun, goofy movie I remember renting when it first came out . I hadn't seen it in quite a while and couldn't find it on any of the movie channels, I searched for it here on Amazon and was lucky enough to find a copy.",1417737600,,222,3.74468085106383
844423,4,6304259115,"Carpool is one of those old movies that just managed to fly under my radar, and I was happy to have discovered it on Amazon. The mix of each character's particular desperation was well developed in concept and presentation. Chuck McCann, in particular, shines as the inept and corrupt cop! If you are looking for some light entertainment that is appropriate for the entire family, you won't go wrong with Carpool.",1417305600,,413,4.830985915492958
844424,3,6304259115,"dated. But worth watching for the unintentionally funny lines such as ""hey, nice car!"" (referring to a 1972 Dodge).",1415059200,,115,5.105263157894737
844425,1,6304259115,"Slow moving and not very funny. Thought with Harvey Korman in it it would be better, but his performance was lack luster. I would be mad if I had to pay to watch it.",1413936000,,165,3.8823529411764706
844426,5,6304259115,Saw this movie once when it first came out on TV in the 80's and had been looking for it ever since. SO FUNNY and totally clean. I HAD to buy it after I watched it again on Amazon Prime - just so I don't lose it again!! It was just as funny some 30 years later (even funnier because of the old technology ).,1411344000,,307,3.7384615384615385
844427,1,6304259115,once again I ordered a movie only wanting standard because when I order hd it won't let me watch them I need a refund,1393545600,,117,3.9166666666666665
844428,1,6304259115,"The only thing going for this movie was a slightly amusing plot that mildly remained on focus. Even the legendary Ernst Borgnine could not save this movie from being almost unwatchable because it was so senseless. Acting was weak at best, even from Brognine in the limited role he played . Harvey Korman managed to hold the primary 4 characters together to some degree.

If for no other reason than to find out what happened to the primary characters, I watched this movie until the end. Thankfully it was free or I would have asked for my money back. If you have nothing better to do it might be worth a one time watch, but don't be surprised if you are disappointed by the silliness of the overall experience.",1392595200,,711,4.511627906976744

844470,5,6304259115,"This movie is not Tom Arnold movie. They have the same name but this movie is about four people who find money and don't know what to do with it. It's pretty funny. Sweet and charming. This is your typical movie bout being at the right place at the wrong time. Finders keepers, losers weepers!",1374537600,3,293,4.345454545454546
844471,5,6304259115,"This is a great movie for the entire family, I remember watching this when I was around 9 years old, now I'm 24 and it's still funny.",1373155200,3,133,3.962962962962963
844472,3,6304259115,"Tom Arnold can play the dim-witted buffoon with a heart of gold better than anyone.  ""No calls!! I mean no obscene calls!! He's trying to quit"".  ""No. I'm not"".  ""Well, you should""!",1371513600,,181,4.59375
844473,5,6304259115,"This old comedy of What, was needed for a real situation of economic propose. Harvey Coreman,TJ Hooker, with cast don properly fitted. Had me laughing nonstop.",1371340800,,159,5.153846153846154

844475,5,6304259115,I love this movie!  My nephews and I watch this movie each time I would visit their house.  It became a tradition for us...and it goes on today!,1365552000,,144,4.107142857142857
844476,5,6304259115,It's a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy watching.  Be sure and get this movie cause the children will watch it over and over again.,1365206400,,141,4.222222222222222
844477,5,6304259115,This is a good movie and a very funny movie. Its one of the few movies that has Tom Arnold in it thats good but it is. The carpool in question are four kids that the moms usually take to school and one other who had to tag along that day. Theres also one of those first love situations. Anyway you should see this movie.,1362528000,,320,3.9384615384615387

844560,4,6304259115,"This is a really great, funny movie. My only disappointment is the case it comes in and the region code doesn't match my DVD in Australia. Not sure if this is spolier or not but I especially like the part where they paint the car pink :)",1332460800,,237,4.0638297872340425
844561,5,6304259115,"This is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a long time and definitely worth buying. Good clean comedy with a great story line and good character interaction. However it would be great if AMAZON.COM and AMAZON.UK would STOP ADVERTISING WHAT THEY DO NOT HAVE!!!!!! This is the third time I bought this only to get an anoying message telling me that my orer has been cancelled due to some availability problem. I realise the communication to resellers is tricky at the best of times, but this is rediculous!!!!",1289260800,,520,4.663043478260869
844562,4,6304259115,"Yes, it's a Tom Arnold movie, yes, it's 14 years old, but it holds up in its silliness. A fun family movie with strong kid characters who stand by the ""bad"" guy, the Tom Arnold character, who ends up carjacking a van with the kids and their strait-laced father (David Paymer), after stealing a bag of money from some bank robbers. There are many car chases -- the best is IN a shopping mall. Arnold is at his best in niceness as a carnival owner who needs money. This was also one of Rod Steiger's last movies, who really shines toward the end as a grumpy, wealthy store owner (who loves chocolate donuts -- is that a product link?). Above all this is one silly, silly-movie -- and that is good! (Oh, a good running joke for adults -- we keep hearing the Ramones' ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" playing on the van's tape (!) deck.)",1282780800,,821,4.303225806451613

844564,2,6304259115,"I thought the movie was funny, enjoyable & well-made. The performances were good especially Tom Arnold & Rhea Pearlman. The problem I had was with the moral problems of the script. Especially the point in the mall, here the father & children are free from being hostages (albeit from a harmless Arnold). At that point, they actually help in the escape of Arnold who, however sympathetic, has comitted a criminal act. So they are then guilty of aiding & abetting a criminal. I know that this didn't bother anyone else reviewing this, nor am I a moralist. But it seemed quite wrong, especially in a family film. The ending somewhat abets this by having Arnold give back the money & perform community service. But I don't see how in a film you can encourage aiding & abetting a criminal. Liking him, being sympathetic & compassionate to him, forgiving him, yes. Helping him crossed a line that shouldn't have been crossed.",1222300800,,919,4.75
