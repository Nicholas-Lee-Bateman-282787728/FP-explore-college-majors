Satan done it again! He is very good in that! Beware the false witness of people who do not know the ways of the Lord.

7794302,5,0971082812,"You cannot deny reality.  Ellen G. White is fundamental to SDA's beliefs.  She didn't have to ""start"" SDA to have become its backbone.  Without a doubt, according to her own writings, she presents the world with a mystical experience in which she provides her readers with new revelation.  Period.

Vision of Ellen G White

We felt an unusual spirit of prayer. And as we prayed the Holy Ghost fell upon us. We were very happy. Soon I was lost to earthly things and was wrapped in a vision of God's glory. I saw an angel flying swiftly to me. He quickly carried me from the earth to the Holy City. In the city I saw a temple, which I entered. I passed through a door before I came to the first veil. This veil was raised, and I passed into the holy place. Here I saw the altar of incense, the candlestick with seven lamps, and the table on which was the shewbread. After viewing the glory of the holy, Jesus raised the second veil and I passed into the holy of holies.

In the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest gold. On each end of the ark was a lovely cherub, with its wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned toward each other, and they looked downward. Between the angels was a golden censer. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright glory, that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. Jesus stood by the ark, and as the saints' prayers came up to Him, the incense in the censer would smoke, and He would offer up their prayers with the smoke of the incense to His Father. In the ark was the golden pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of stone which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God. On one table were four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God's holy name. The holy Sabbath looked glorious -- a halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath commandment was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to break them all, as well as to break the fourth. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath, for He never changes. But the pope had changed it from the seventh to the first day of the week; for he was to change times and laws ....

I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers; and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God's dear, waiting saints (Early Writings, 1963, pp. 32,33).
 The summary meaning of this Ellen G. White's vision is stated as follows:

In this revelation, Mrs. White was carried down to the close of time and saw the Sabbath as the great testing truth on which men decide whether to serve God or to serve an apostate power (Early Writings, pp. 21,22).",1393977600,2,2956,4.225177304964539
7794303,1,0971082812,"i didn't see the movie, which did sparked my interest for about half a second while browsing amazon for Adventist related info.  Forgive me for the common misunderstanding of authors quoting other authors like themselves, because they share the same thought, there is this saying ""people shoot at eagles and
feed pigeons"" not to offend animal lovers, but to make the point.  When David go up against Goliath, most ideology is to move him out of the way to protect him,
or to make him feel inferior.  But as the Bible says when God is on your side, who can be against you.  In this case the Eagle is Not Goliath but David. So is Advent ism to those who don't understand the religion, but look to information like this one.",1358899200,,721,4.480916030534351

7794305,5,0971082812,"It is difficult to accurately present the doctrines of the Adventist church because they have evolved since the inception of the denomination, or at least the presentation of the doctrines have. Also, statements from Adventist literature and high ranking leaders in the church often contradict the doctrines presented to the general Christian community. This is because the church wants to be accepted by the Christian community, yet also appease those in the denomination who continue to hold to the fundamental beliefs. As a result, every person who is an SDA or studies Adventism can come to a slightly different understanding as to what the church actually believes. This video is a good starting point to understand what the church teaches and the foundations of the denomination. Perhaps Adventists who reject this video as false should consider instead rejecting the false teachings of Ellen G. White and the SDA church.",1350777600,6,927,5.228187919463087

7794307,5,0971082812,"A lot of people reviewing this video are obviously SDAs who are offended by its revealing of the truth about this church. After the Bible was written, why does anyone need an extra Biblical writer to interpret *add to and change* the Word of God? I was born and raised a SDA and I am glad someone put forth the effort to expose this denomination. I hold this denomination responsible for a lot of problems and dysfunction I have observed personally.

SDAs will not listen to you. They think anyone who attempts to discuss the Bible with them and is *not an SDA* is trying to deceive them. They DO have a cult mentality about their beliefs.

This is simply my comment on a subject I feel strongly about and have witnessed as a former SDA. Thank you for the opportunity to encourage people to find out the truth for themselves, and God bless.",1287360000,20,953,4.403409090909091
7794308,1,0971082812,"I saw enough YouTube clips of this documentary to know that the arguments made in this movie are not based on fact, nor on a real understanding of the history of the SDA Church or the proper place of Ellen White in the movement. Having studied theology at an Adventist university and having worked for awhile at the Ellen White Estate there, I know more about the church than this document claims to tell.

First off, Ellen White was not *the* founder of the SDA church. If anything, she was one of a dozen people who were involved at the beginning. Second, I agree with other reviewers here: just because a few people on the fringe might quote Ellen White as if she is equal to the Bible doesn't mean that's what the denomination teaches. SDA's don't put Ellen White on the same level of the Bible, because even though they see her as inspired by God, they look to the Bible alone as the only authority by which all else is to be tested. In other words, you could throw out Ellen White and still believe the same doctrines of the SDA church. That's why SDA's are SO unconcerned that people accuse Ellen White of copying a lot of her work from other people as was common practice among Christian writers back then, because it doesn't change the teachings that are based on the Bible.

In fact, I think the BIGGEST misconception is that SDA theology came out of nowhere, as if it was all based on one person's writings. Thousands of Christians from varying denominations had joined in the Millerite movement and the Great Disappointment because they had come to the same conclusions based on historicist interpretations of Bible prophecies, and this was BEFORE Ellen White. Actually, SDA theology is a continuing development of Protestant theology, borrowing from Baptists and Methodists. Ellen White herself was a former Methodist and many of her teachings are a further refinement of John Wesley and others. Nevertheless, SDA theology was not ""founded"" by Ellen White, but rather it was developed and refined by a group of people over a period of time. Perhaps it's easier for people to attack SDA's and blame SDA theology on one person than to admit that SDA's actually borrowed many teachings from their own churches and developed them further!",1278460800,18,2247,4.729591836734694
7794309,1,0971082812,"This ""documentary"" is more of a witch hunt against the SDA church than anything else. It tries to connect SDA's with all kinds of crazy fringe things that the church itself rejected. Furthermore it gives the typical misconception that SDA's view White as equal with the Bible. From my research they view her as inspired, but not at the same level with the Bible. Their fundamental belief #18 states ""as the Lord's messenger, her [White's] writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction."" They also make clear that ""the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested"", showing that they hold the Bible as higher. There are a few SDA's that may view them equally but those are largely on the fringe of the religion. Even though some of the SDA's beliefs are dif. than typical evangelical protestantism calling them a cult is way too extreme and misleading.",1232323200,23,970,4.920731707317073
