2347337,5,B000A0GYB4,"This video is great - one of my daughter's favourites!  Glad to see Pippi is still alive and well.  This is a classic and very much appreciated by me, as a parent, in a time when plastic people such as Hannah Montana and Jessica Simpson reign.",1211414400,5,243,4.260869565217392
2347338,2,B000A0GYB4,"When I discovered that there was a Pippi Longstocking movie with Inger Nilsson on DVD with Closed Captioned. I purchased this movie with excitement and looking forward to reliving the childhood memory. You see, back in the old days there were no subtittles or closed captioned avaliable during my childhood when I was watching this tomboy redhead with pigtails and freckles without any one telling me what she is saying or to her two buddies on TV. I was looking forward to learn what are the words that I have missed. To my greatest disappointment to find that this DVD movie was not closed captioned. I did report to Amazon about this to prevent any further deaf customers from experiencing the same disappointment as I have.

Although, this movie has much of the same orignal colors, and it has not change as if it was the same day that I saw as a kid. Still an enjoyable movie for any age from 5 to 100 years old. Inger was the only actor that I know that was perfect for the role of Pippi Longstocking. However, I have decided to keep this movie until there is a real DVD movie with closed captioned release in the future. I recommend that any of you should wait until they really have closed captioned on this wonderful movie.",1185926400,12,1232,4.5
2347339,4,B000A0GYB4,"Pippi Longstocking is every parent's nightmare. She is rude, manner less, uncouth, and loud.  However, she is also full of soul, caring, generous, and loving. I have to give this movie two thumbs up for worming its way into my heart.

I watched this classic over and over as a child, and knew that I had to see it again. I didn't necessarily remember the voice overs the first time around. They are quite distracting, but I can understand why there were no subtitles.

Nonetheless, this DVD would be a great addition to any child's repertoire.",1181779200,2,543,4.635416666666667

2347341,5,B000A0GYB4,"My 10 year old absolutely adored this movie as I knew she would. The video and audio on the DVD have definitely been remastered and was much better that I could ever remember previously.

2347342,4,B000A0GYB4,"When I was little I loved the Pippi Longstocking movies (in Germany), now my kids love them. Since they're educated trilingual we have the series in German, Dutch and English. The truest one seems to be the German version (well, the movies were a German/Swedish production), the Dutch is pretty good too, although some of the voices are far too squeeky. The English version is well translated but edited a lot and even put together in another order! Still, Pippi rules. And a lot better than some Powerpuff girls or Little Ponies!",1140652800,26,530,4.771739130434782
2347343,4,B000A0GYB4,"I bought this DVD thinking back to when I was a child and how much I enjoyed the video... it must have been a different one.  Or at least I don't remember the voice over, as an adult it's distracting.  My two children enjoyed it immensely though!  I'm sure we'll be watching it over and over, well at least they will, the voice over bothers me.",1139788800,24,344,4.181818181818182

2347397,5,B000A0GYB4,"Pippi Longstocking (1969) was released in late 1973 in the U.S., after being successful in Europe. The voices of the actors had to be dubbed over in English, which easily shows in the out of sync talking in relation to mouth movement. While mildly annoying, it doesn't take away from the movie itself, as this first installment is worthy of praise. Pippi and her new friends seek one adventure after another, and the overall tone is cheerful and the mischief is playful. I overlook the almost laughable special effects (such as when Pippi lifts her horse, or when she lofts her tormentor into a tree), because a movie like this doesn't need the best effects to be good, and the obvious fact that this movie was made in the late 1960's. Overall, this movie is fun, and recommended.",1441238400,,780,4.659420289855072

And indeed, adults will not be very impressed with this film. The production value is low. Very low. The dubbing is off, and the special effects are laughable. You'll listen and wonder as the dubbing actors use a German accent for the local police officers, a southern US accent for the hardware owner, a Russian accent for Pippi's dad.

But none of that seemed to matter to my kids, who watched the entire thing with smiles on their faces, and declared the movie ""funnier than Sponge Bob"". High praise, indeed!",1295222400,,753,4.449275362318841

My 5 year old son is all about Pippi now that he has seen it.  At first he was concerned that it was a ""girl"" movie, but now Pippi is his hero!  ...and the movie kept my attention too.
