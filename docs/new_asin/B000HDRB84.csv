8138904,1,B000HDRB84,"Just finished watching this on Prime streaming and wish I hadn't wasted the time.  This 'docudrama' is short on facts, long winded and the narrator can't be bothered to pronounce a major historical figure's name correctly for most of the second episode.  Seriously, the narrator pronounces French buccaneer and author Alexandre Exquemelin's last name as 'Excelmin'.  What, the film's producers and director couldn't be bothered to correct the guy after the first few dozen times?!  In all honesty, you'd be better off reading the big online encyclopedia site's pirate entries.",1499558400,,576,5.366666666666666

8138908,5,B000HDRB84,"Although presented out of chronological order, this documentary hits all the important points on the history of piracy, complete with replica ships, old film, drawings, experts and reenactors, and an accurate account of what high-seas piracy was really like.  Not for Johnny Depp fans, this give the story of the REAL pirates of the Caribbean, and elsewhere.",1393718400,4,358,5.280701754385965
