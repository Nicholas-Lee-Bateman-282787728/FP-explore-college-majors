3661102,5,B001JXPC0U,"I have been a big fan of Gordon Ramsey for years now. From his books to various shows, it really doesn't get more entertaining the chef Ramsey. I find that the BBC kitchen nightmares has more of a refined & professional feel as opposed to the American version but still is equally as hilarious. You also get to see a somewhat kinder side of Gordon. Yes he's still very intense but uses it more to motivate owners & employees to get their acts together so their restaurant will succeed. Overall just a great show for anyone, especially those who are a fan of cooking.",1247875200,4,566,4.451923076923077
3661103,5,B001JXPC0U,"Well...any of us, that began our fascination w/ Hell's Kitchen, will be even more impressed.  Gordon is better in the UK version, than the US.  I have been to Europe...and glad to see---the chef is enlightening us all...to the reality (behind the scenes), of what lies across the seas.  No Martha Stewart~Thank God!!!!",1241481600,,318,4.962264150943396
3661104,5,B001JXPC0U,"Apparently it has become popular for people with no business experience to open restaurants and then have people with no cooking experience dupe them into hiring them as their head chefs. Well Gordan ain't gonna let that slide and uses his 'charm' to help these places out.

I enjoyed the American spin off and watch Hell's Kitchen so was already a fan before I got this dvd. I heard the original U.K. version was better and I have to agree. It feels more real because Ramsey is in his home turf of merry old England. This is also the first time I've watched Ramsey from a DVD so not having the bleeping censors is awesome! The slang is strong and some people are hard to understand but not enough to detract from the show. The only negative is not enough episodes, I think the entire box set has 6 episodes. Great show, great to see Gordon uncensored, and cool to see a slice of life across the Atlantic.",1241136000,,905,4.386904761904762
3661105,5,B001JXPC0U,I read the review of this program in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY and they gave it an A-...they're so right! Ramsay is an incredible personality and a delight to watch. I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves the US knock-offs with Ramsay. The UK does it better!,1240531200,,263,4.617021276595745

3661107,5,B001JXPC0U,"Finally, in all it's uncensored glory, the first series of the UK ""Kitchen Nightmares"" has arrived!  The first four original episodes and Gordon's revisits are:

1. Bonaparte's
2. The Glass House
3. The Walnut Tree
4. Moore Place

Bonaparte's is notoriously known to KN watchers as the restaurant whose owner, Sue Ray tried unsuccessfully to sue GR.  Also, the young head chef Tim not only served Gordon a rancid scallop, but didn't even know how to make an omlette. The Glass House features one of Gordon's least favorite (and bad risotto making) chefs, Richard.  The man seriously had a risotto with pomegranate on the menu.  The Walnut Tree, whose owner basically refused to take Gordon's advice is a classic example of a restaurant desperately holding on to past glory. Moore Place was the big purple monster where the deep fryer and microwaves worked longer hours than the kitchen brigade.

It's a great show, with none of the overblown music and 'impending doom' narration of the US version. Bring on Series 2, 3, 4 & 5!",1236556800,13,1026,4.828571428571428
3661108,5,B001JXPC0U,"A great show & the reason I came to love Gordon Ramsay in the first place (from the airings of these episodes on BBC America).  These episodes are uncensored, so be prepared to hear F-Bombs droping throughout the shows.

But be warned: If you were lucky enough to pick up ""Kitchen Nightmares: Vol. 1"", then you already have all the episodes on this release.  Volume 1 actually has all the episodes from Series 1 & 2.  Volume 2 has all the episodes from Series 3 & 4.  Volumes 1 & 2 were a Canadian release & were sold thru Amazon for a short time (Amazon is where I got mine).  Sadly, it looks like they are no longer available thru Amazon.

If you don't have Volume 1, then by all means order this Series 1 DVD.  If you do have Volume 1, then you are just buying the same episodes that you already have.",1232323200,43,804,4.175324675324675
3661109,5,B001JXPC0U,"I caught this one night on tv and was hooked!  I love to cook and be in the kitchen, so this was a good fit.  Its interesting to get an inside view of some fancy (and some not so) restaurants and see how things work...and well don't.

Ramsay is hard on these people and its good, you can tell he has a love for food and quality!  All in all the show is pretty quick paced, with some pretty rough times for these restaurant owners and employees.  I will caution you though some of the episodes will make you never wanna eat out again :(

I will be purchasing this on DVD as soon as it releases!",1231977600,5,593,4.0256410256410255

3661141,4,B001JXPC0U,"These earlier KN episodes are better than those which came later. Ramsay is more genuine in the earlier shows, and they're more about the nuts-and-bolts of running a restaurant than about the ""drama"" of Ramsay swooping in to save the day.",1419120000,,238,4.829268292682927

3661144,1,B001JXPC0U,"Just to be clear... great show, far better than the Fox version I give the program itself 5 stars.

The dismal rating is to Amazon. Where do they get off charging $1.99 per episode (or 2.99 for ""HD"") for a show that was produced by The BBC- a network funded by the British government for free of charge broadcast. Not to mention the fact that this (better) version of the show hasn't released a new episode in nearly 3 years. I could go on and on about why this should be available in SD for free.

No added drama like in the US episodes. This is the real Ramsay. Yes he is still the king of the four letter words and he still gets on these owners but the way he does it is real and not hyped up for the American market.
I know of 24 episodes, minus the revisited ones, and all of them are excellent. I have watched these shows over and over again and they never get old. Do yourself a favor and check out these shows from series 1 episode 1 until the Great British Nightmare which were the last two places Ramsay went to help.

3661173,5,B001JXPC0U,"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares UK is far superior to it's American counterpart.
In this version Gordon Ramsay acts as the narrator of the show and he spends a great deal of time teaching, cooking, and showing different marketing techniques that could help your restaurant. The style is similar to that of a documentary rather than the reality TV show seen on American televisions.
Although the language is far more coarse in the British version, the actual content is less offensive and volatile.
For the American viewers you will be delighted in the information found in each episode as well as Ramsay's excellent narration. He is a bit fond of the phrase ""hemorrhaging cash"" as well as taking off his shirt in order to put on his chef's coat each episode, but those oddities eventually turned into a source of affection for me towards the show.",1330560000,5,843,4.861111111111111
3661174,5,B001JXPC0U,"I knew there are a lot of ""bleeps"" in the US.  Here in the UK we hear the real details. I kind of like it :}  More real, in the details, in my opinion",1313366400,3,150,3.3823529411764706
3661195,5,B001JXPC0U,"People who are in any part of the restaurant business can't miss Ramsay's critiques. His videos can save a business years of time, wasted effort and money. I cannot think of another TV series or cookbook that can claim the same. So. That's five stars.

But if you are a home cook, beware! There are lessons here you do not want to adopt. Ramsay is concerned with making businesses profitable. Not with making the best home meals. At home, people are not concerned with serving 30 tables quickly and economically. When you cook for a family, you look for a just a few servings of meat, fish and veggies that your family likes. It doesn't matter that you're buying the last available in the bin for the season, or that it will only keep fresh for another day, because they'll welcome another serving of what they like.

Ramsay is obsessed with freshness partly because it's a substitute for time-consuming, difficult processes ill-suited for a commercial restaurants' assembly line cooking.

The idea that freshness is available in most ingredients, for most recipies is a mirage. And I say that, even living in California, near the coast. It's difficult to buy fresh fish, even though they live 30 miles away. Fresh vegetables are no problem -- as long as you're willing to put up with standard items, in season, non-organic, and not imported from Mexico.

What Ramsay has done is show the drive and creativity necessary for good cooking. What you don't want to do is assume this make-a-buck-soaking-customers mentality is naturally what you want to cook for yourself, friends, and loved ones.

P.S. I'll add here that I've given up Indian cooking almost entirely. The quality control was so awful with ingredients coming from India, I was scared. I bought a package of papadums that had so many animal hairs, they were lined up in neat rows. This is a country where millions of people can barely afford food to survive. You don't want to be buying ingredients from India. Period. Forget your fantasy about how exotic it tastes. Anything at all could be in it.",1309046400,,2059,4.788732394366197

3661197,3,B001JXPC0U,"Very good show, I like to see how restaurant close of bankrupt can be alive again with the experience of Chef Ramsay.

The bad thing is, they said 'eight' episodes, which is false. 5th to 8th are only the 10 minutes which Gordon Ramsay come back to restaurants, added to first to 4th episode. Kind of scam.

3661199,5,B001JXPC0U,I love the show when it's on locally but prefer to watch it on DVD because they don't have beeps every five seconds. We have no problem with the language as it's a common occurrence now days and much less intrusive than the beeping. It's educational and fun to watch all of Gordon Ramsay's programs.,1274227200,,299,4.454545454545454
3661200,5,B001JXPC0U,"I was always aware of Gordon Ramsay but never watched any of his shows till recently.  I have become hooked on the US version of KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.  So hooked that I just had to purchase both of the British series that are available.  I am so glad I did and cannot praise it enough.  Here I am reviewing the complete series one of RAMSAY'S KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.  What Ramsay does here is exactly the same as he does in the US version.  Restaurants in trouble have contacted him seeking his expertise and help.  He goes to them, investigates in depth what problems exist and helps them to see the problems and implement changes that will hopefully stick.

Here is some news.  If you enjoy the US version the British version is better in every way.  With British television very little is censored and you see and hear everything and it is much more real.  You also see how the producers sensationalize the US version which is of course how US television is done.  But it is not necessary.  By being uncensored you get to see more of the real Gordon Ramsay.  He is very tough and very honest while at the same time being very compassionate.  The restaurants and their problems speak for themselves.  No sensationalizing is necessary.  Just make sure you notice how many bleeps there are in the US version for the language is totally unedited here and there is much f----, etc.  So be prepared.  But what you get is a world class chef showing us the problems that exist in many restaurants.  He does an amazing job at this as well as discovering the true positive entity that exists within each restaurant.

Some say each episode is the same.  This is in no way true.  The premise of the show is that he goes to restaurants and does what he does but each restaurant is a different unique experience.  I find the British version to be so much better than how reality shows are done in the US.  If you love Gordon Ramsay and his honesty and skill this series is a highly recommended must. Not just for the fun of watching him but also for an education on restaurants, food and what to watch out for when you think you are just going out for a nice dinner.",1270339200,12,2149,4.420918367346939
3661201,5,B001JXPC0U,"I love Kitchen Nightmares.  These restaurants are in trouble, whether they call in Gordon Ramsay or not.  They have nothing to lose.  Some people say that he does the same thing over and over, but sometimes he makes a difference.  He makes them face reality.

3661202,4,B001JXPC0U,"It's a good show, but it gets docked a notch for purporting to be 387 minutes.  One would assume this to be 387 unduplicated minutes, but 150 of those minutes are just a repeat of each of the four episodes with ten minutes  tacked on of Ramsay returning to the restaurant months later.  It is only about 230 minutes of unrepeated footage.  I felt a little cheated.",1256947200,3,364,4.388059701492537
3661203,4,B001JXPC0U,"I originally picked this up in a local entertainment store, mistakenly thinking it was the US version.  However, the UK version proved to be an extremely pleasant surprise and I'm glad I purchased it.

Chef Ramsay is well-known to most television viewers on both sides of the pond by now, so a quick rundown of his ""bedside manner"" in these kitchens will suffice.  Be prepared for lots of f-bombs and healthy doses of criticism on restaurants, their managers, and staff, that really need it.  Ramsay doesn't pull punches and his honesty is refreshing; that his assessments are almost always accurate provide a credibility that viewers can appreciate.

The four restaurants Ramsay visits are the Bonaparte's, a fine dining venue; The Glass House, a tourist-area restaurant with lots of competition; The Walnut Tree Inn, a restaurant with a Michelin star and a unique history and place as a local dining institution; and Moore Place, located next a golf course, and whose menu is deep-fat-frying focused horror straight out of the 1970s.

Although the unique culture of each restaurant is interesting, the editors did a fantastic job by making Ramsay's interactions with management, staff, and the locals as the dramatic element of the series.  You can see that Gordon really cares about seeing these institutions become successful, and it makes for extremely compelling viewing.  The payoff at the end of seeing proprietors and staff realize what they are capable of being in providing quality food and great service is especially gratifying, even if they are not always successful at maintaining that momentum over the long run (as the ""Revisited"" episodes show)

As an American, I found the operation of the restaurants portrayed here to be particularly fascinating, especially since these places seem to rely quite a bit on local markets to get their ingredients, as opposed to a corporate supplier here in the US like Sysco to bring them via semi-truck every other day.  I can imagine it takes a great deal of forethought and creativity to prepare a menu based on the availability of local ingredients, and gave me a greater appreciation for how difficult it is to keep a restaurant successfully running regardless of its location.

I knocked off a star because I would have liked to see some more special features on the DVD set, such as deleted scenes.

If you enjoy travel shows, food-related television, and/or Gordon Ramsay's bombastic personality, pick up this DVD set.",1256256000,2,2478,5.061425061425061
