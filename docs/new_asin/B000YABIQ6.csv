3018232,5,B000YABIQ6,It would be really really swell if I could add the Mad Men DVD to my gift list and be able to give it to my loved ones! AMC is missing out on a lucrative opportunity by not releasing it in time for the Holidays and that makes me sad.,1195948800,9,233,3.68
3018233,5,B000YABIQ6,"It is incomprehensible to me that this exquisite evocation of such a deeply familiar and shockingly strange era is not yet available on DVD. Of the few shows that rise above the level of entertainment to attain something more permanent and profound, fewer still fail to lose anything significant on repeat viewings. And to be one of the fewest of the few and not be available on DVD? What? And while we're at it, AMC? Really?",1195603200,5,425,4.605263157894737
3018234,5,B000YABIQ6,"this was by far the best show in a long time. being close to the ad game, only added to my addiction. the bad news is i deleted from my dvr b/c i thought the dvd would be out as soon as the season was over. but no!!! stupid shows are released on dvd a lot sooner. i wanted to put this on my xmas list, but i can't.

p.s. i'm still waiting for molly dodd to be released too! what's up with that?",1195516800,3,394,3.6904761904761907
3018235,5,B000YABIQ6,"The only unfortunate thing about this show is that I don't already have the 1st. season in my DVD collection.  I'm watching the reruns, but I need a dose each day.  Next summer will be far too long in coming.  Hurry AMC with the DVD.  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1195344000,3,260,4.586956521739131
3018236,5,B000YABIQ6,"This was one of THE best new shows on TV this fall, I am surprised that AMC has not jumped the gun and put together a DVD box set together for holiday buyers!

Echoing the sentiments of previous posters, this show was multi-faceted, with subtle layers, meaning you could watch it over and over again and find a small detail you missed the first time.

I can't wait for MADMEN next fall!",1195257600,5,386,4.347222222222222
3018237,5,B000YABIQ6,"i couldn't have said it better than the previous reviewer.  This show is absolutely addicting and completely in the realm of almost entertainment therapy, since any adult can relate to the situations of this show. The social strata and class labels of ""secretaries"", ""bosses"" and ""wives"" and their assigned roles and duties is sheer brilliant drama and the frustrations of those in the classes is effectively conveyed to us.  You can see the 60's ready to explode with the liberation of all these classes and ""free"" the women from the men, the men from their almost god-like bosses (having to take off their shoes to enter his office like entering a temple) and the general workplace poplulation from onsite smoking and drinking and carousing.  it makes you wonder how would life today be if things were still like that, but i get the feeling that the creator's purpose is not so much to contrast, but to juxtaposition, to make you really think... did it really change?... is it really any different now?......

When this comes on DVD every adult in America will enjoy this show!",1195171200,15,1079,4.816216216216216
3018238,5,B000YABIQ6,"Attention goons at AMC! Pleeeeeeeeeeease don't wait forever and a day to release the season 1 DVD set for your marvelous evocation of the New Frontier era, you know, the transition period between the relative comformity of the Eisenhower era, and full-blown upheaval of the mid to late 1960s and its various social revolutions. MAD MEN has been far and away the best and deepest program that television has had to offer in 2007. God bless you for producing it!",1195171200,10,460,4.7625

3018262,4,B000YABIQ6,"Bought this mostly out of curiosity. Everyone harps on and on about how this is the greatest tv series ever made. I watched the entire first seas and part of the second season, as of yet. It isn't bad. Not nearly as fantastic as all the hype. It definitely shows how things were, without pulling any punches. A lot of sexism, excessive smoking, drinking whiskey at work and cheating on wives. People were unhealthy and would do anything to make a sale. I still do not care much for any of the characters, but overall it is a decent series.",1515283200,,539,4.4

3018320,5,B000YABIQ6,"This show transports me back to my own childhood, more in the later years of the series that this one. Every suffocating, irritating family tradition and dysfunctional gathering channeled into one TV show.
For me this show is less about nostalgia and more about realizing special moments are not the ones I you originally think they are. To me this is the real genius of the show and how these moments happen for all of the characters. The famous events are nice guideposts but somewhat extraneous.",1489190400,,498,4.8023255813953485

3018349,3,B000YABIQ6,"I've heard about Mad Men for years and how it is one of the best shows ever. After watching Maggie Siff in Sons of Anarchy and hearing that she came from Mad Men I thought that I would give it a try because I wanted to watch her. The show is very, very, very slow and not much action. I grew up watching classic movies with my mom so I really like the 50's and 60's so I enjoy the costumes, props and set. I do notice how much everyone in the office drinks during the day not sure if people in those days drank that much, if they did that is crazy! I'm not a huge fan of the show but will continue to watch to see if it gets better!",1483488000,,632,3.7954545454545454

3018355,5,B000YABIQ6,"This show gets better and better, but this first season is defintely worth watching. It provides the mission statement that would be expanded throughout the run of the series as Don Draper's personal identity crisis expands into the identity of the entire era and asks questions about gender roles that are not normally posited on network television.",1481414400,,350,5.157894736842105

As someone who came of age in the late 60's, I found the show very realistic and the attention to detail superb.

3018381,4,B000YABIQ6,"I did not watch this show during it's run and usually wait to binge on it as I just did.  It's a groundbreaking period piece that takes you through the entire 60's as seen through the eyes of the employees of a Madison Avenue advertising agency.  Production value is absolutely superb. With all the hype, I was a bit surprised at the slow pace of the show and the characterization of Don Draper.  Draper is an ad executive that's supposedly brilliant, but deeply flawed with a troubled past.  So right off the bat the protagonist is someone you can't really get behind and seriously will let everyone down in his life, yet still achieves success and riches.  He's someone you you want to root for instinctively at first, but you wind just easing into watching his train wreck of a life unfold.  Since I work in a corporation in a similar role the episodes kind of reminded me of living through elements of my own professional life but with the flawed people we would have fired instead of the truly brilliant professionals that last in today's workforce.  But that's the charm of the series.  It's that the norms in the 60's don't apply to today's society and the seeds of what we have today were just sown then. So I stuck with the series and while it didn't blow me away with really sharp story telling, it did take me on an interesting ride that doesn't insult my intelligence like the empty minded cheap sitcoms the networks try to force down our throat.",1475193600,,1458,4.517110266159696

3018383,5,B000YABIQ6,"Great show! Just bought Season 2 and 3. Only downfall is that the first time I ordered it, the show wouldn't work on my Chromebox. Have to watch it on my droid phone.",1473897600,,166,4.0606060606060606
3018384,5,B000YABIQ6,Second or third best TV show of all time.,1473897600,,41,3.6666666666666665
3018385,5,B000YABIQ6,"Im going to talk about setting for a minute since everything else has been said.

I used to have a world cultures teacher that would give us a map of the continent we were studying for that particular quarter and hed give a list of countries, capitals, rivers, ect. If we identified everything accurately on the list, he would grade you. D-minus.

He told us that extra effort yield extra grading and that doing the minimum would get you the minimum grade.

Okay then, some of use would identify every city in a country by buying a .3mm mechanical pencil and microscopically identify every village along the Amazon in Brazil.

Anyways, I tell that story because when a movie or show gets the setting absolutely dead on accurateD-Minus!

Mad Men gets an A+ for setting. They don't just get it accurately, they incorporate it into the character of Don Draper. The story takes place during a time when America was moving into a consumerists society. We wanted to be lied to and lured through advertising. The character of Draper is the microcosmos of that national feeling at the time.

Hes a man who has a secret identity. Is Don Draper his secret identity or is it Dick Whitman. Since he identifies with Draper and views Whitman as a different life Id say Whitman is his secret identity and Draper is who he really is.

What better occupation and setting for this man than advertising where the curtains are always drawn to hid the man (hint-his name is Draper, get it?)

Everything Draper does with his Barbie doll wife Betty is about living a life that isn't real but real enough to Draper. I think hes one of the more interesting characters Ive ever met.",1470441600,,1656,4.608843537414966

3018416,5,B000YABIQ6,"What's great about ""Mad Men"" is that it doesn't indulge in the usual cliches about the 1960s. All the characters are depicted as living only in the moment and oblivious to how history will later view that era. Yes, we have the obligatory mentions of JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King, et al, but there is no dramatic underlining of these figures, no breathless nostalgia for how people looked and acted.  This is a refreshing change from shows that are set in the past but are too self-conscious about it (think ""That 70s Show"", or ""Happy Days"").

""Mad Men"" is more than a history lesson and an excuse to trot out vintage pillbox hats and white gloves. I think this is because creator Matthew Weiner is a member of Gen X, that often maligned offspring of famously narcissistic and self-congratulatory Baby Boomers, rather than the retro-loving, surface-is-all hipster crowd who think clothing and protests (whatever they're for) are what made the 60s cool.

In addition to great characterization, dialogue, plot, etc, it shows how people of that era really acted toward one another with unblinking honesty: no one here apologizes for having racist, sexist or anti-Semitic thoughts. They will do Al Jolson in blackface, insult Japanese or Jewish businessmen, pull up women's skirts and call them ""honey"" and ""sweetheart"" and think nothing of it. That honesty in itself is revolutionary, and serves as a frequent wake up call to anyone yearning to idealize that era.  No, this is America in all its ugliness, even at the height of its money and power.",1465948800,,1544,4.904214559386973

3018557,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men will hook you! It is a great drama series. What makes it so?
Writing-Director and Writer Matthew Weiner has written smart scripts which remind this reviewer of the prose encountered in a good novel!
Acting-Headed by the outstanding Jon Hamm who plays the tormented ad man Don Draper the series sparkles with acting from each of the featured actors. These actors give their roles depth and make you care about what happens to them.
Costumes and Sets-Evoke the period of the late 1950s and early 1960's in beautiful pastel colors. The period detail is astounding! Evocative of the palettes drawn in his motion pictures by Alfred Hitchcock and his talented team.
Plot-Sterling Cooper and its ad men and support staff show us how an ad agency worked in the days of male chauvinistic behavior in the office; constant cigarette smoking and the crass sexism and racism of this earlier era in American history.

3018592,1,B000YABIQ6,"I'm in awe how this tv series gets all this love and attention
It's dry stiff and maybe the biggest tv Hype jobs in the last 20 years
I tried to watch it from the beginning (Got through 3 episodes good Lord it was kinda like masterbating with a cheese grater. Slightly amusing, but mostly painful) The only redeeming quality  is the production  (The detail to the time era is  amazing and very stunning
But, that's it
This tv series proves deep down anyone who ""claims"" they are a uber fan of this are closeted Hipsters
Most people say they love it to look cool so the people around you can go wow ooh and ah!
Give me a  break Please
Jon Hamm lives up to his name sake (He's a one trick pony of a actor there are so many Great actors that deserve Respect and awards) But, this smock gets one of the lamest ducks ever But, somehow comes out on top! Crazy Jon Hamm is proof you can make a deal with the devil
Cause there is Nothing special about him (The Shows is done and over) you'll never see him get all the attention and phony praise again
the writing is there I openly admit I couldn't get into it (It's so bloody slow it's like watching paint dry)
I never claimed to be brilliant or the smartest guy in the room  (But, I love History and know quit a bit for someone my age) And if i can't get into this how can people in there 20's ???? Really
It's won the awards it has Cause let's be honest AMC did some under the table old school payola  (and payed the academy off)
AMC payed off various award shows just for bragging rights
That way AMC can add that  it in there tv spots
I can appreciate a slow burn  when telling a story
This ain't the BBC's Downtown Abby
I get and understand why Breaking Bad was awesome and that got dismal ratings number
I just wish more  people gushing over this series were Honest about it
But, why would i expect anyone online to be real and honest",1438128000,,1882,4.134246575342465

3018622,5,B000YABIQ6,"SHEER GENIUS 1960s CULTURE! Jon Hamm's character, Don Draper is enough to watch the show. John Slattery's character, Roger Sterling is also the most loveable arrogant jerk ever. Anyone who rates this show less than 4-5 stars is probably a high school drop out. The main reason to watch this show is not the soap opera drama or the chain smoking of cigarettes. It's the way these Advertising people changed 1960s culture. In one episode Pete Campbell starts to notice that the African American market are the only people purchasing Admiral TVs. When he starts to research this and write campaigns to target this marketing group, he is raked over the coals by his racist, pig headed bosses. This is just one example of genius writing of Mad Men.

I had some outfits exactly to what the character wore. I was so excited for this series. As I watched each season I got less and less enchanted with it as it just became who was Draper sleeping with, the politics at his office etc. Actually Draper's character is a real jerk.

So pixilated and blurry, it's hardly worth watching; it's so very frustrating and unfortunate with a show like this, where visually it truly is a masterpiece.

Its funny how we have become so sensitive to things that were quite acceptable in our childhood.  When I saw Sally running into the room with a dry cleaning bag draped over her head my eyes popped out of my head and the bells went off...""this is not a toy""...but that's how it was back then.  There is so much smoking that I have to get up and leave the room for a breath of fresh air....but then in the 60's, my mom always had a cigarette going.

3018843,3,B000YABIQ6,"This review is for the entire series, not just one episode or one season.  Don't get me wrong--this is a decently written, mostly entertaining, sometimes preachy series.  It will keep your interest...for the most part. But Weiner engages in gross exaggeration at various times, trying -- it seems -- to destroy the notion that anything good happened in the 1960s!  In other words, he goes WAY overboard.  Just a couple of examples:

Quick, answer this question: How many American adults smoked in the 1960s?  Especially if you have watched MM, what is your answer?  90%?  80%?  75%?  65%?  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  According to the CDC (and they, if anything, are incentivized to be on the high end) the HIGHEST % of smokers in this country was in 1955, and it peaked at about 45% !!  And it trended downward from there.  And by 1960, 1961, etc., when are the beginning years for MM, the actual percentage is lower, around 42% !  But on this show, EVERYONE smokes, and they do it all the time!  The priest, secretaries at their desks, doctors, ALL the big wigs!  I would say that the smoking rate is portrayed at around 80-95% !!  So why does Weiner do this?  Does he not know the actual smoking rates?  Does he really think that executives would allow secretaries to smoke while typing so ash would get all over the paper??  Not sure if Weiner was not around in the 60s (I was raised then), but he is way off.  My dad smoked, and many (I would say less than half) of his male friends did....but it was extremely rare to hear of or see a wife smoking in those circles.  That was considered very ""unladylike.""  But not on Mad Men!  He is simply way, way off here...and it looks like he's either preaching to destroy the 60s or simply ignorant.

Second, on a family picnic, Don and Betts just leave ALL their garbage on the grass, and the show makes a point of having Don throw his beer can on the grass!!  This is absurd.  Again, the Drapers are upper end people, and it would have been considered the epitome of poor taste to be dirty and trashy like that.  That was for people who didn't know better.  Hell, military guys often destroyed cigarettes and put their clipped fingernails in their pockets in the learned zeal to police everything!  Did Americans litter more in the 1960s?  Probably?  But people like the Drapers would not have--not because they were all that concerned about the environment, but because it was so ""lower class"" to be pigs.

Weiner writes more like he has HEARD about the 60s more than actually lived them.  Or, if he did, he exaggerated all of the decade's traits to become a preacher.  So the writing is not NEARLY as good as Breaking Bad, but it is decent.",1427068800,,2691,4.49896480331263

3018944,5,B000YABIQ6,"There are few things seemingly more painful than watching the first episode of Mad Men for the first time. The show ""starts,"" you're introduced to some characters, some vague plot lines that are bound to never ever resolve themselves, and then 45 minutes later it ends.

If you're anything like me, that's the point when you'll stop watching. Sure the costumes were cool, but good god clearly nothing is going to happen, and they just put Dawson's Creek on Prime. I'll show myself to the door.

But then, some time will pass--it could be any amount of time; a couple days, a week, a month--you'll be bored and alone again, and you'll think that maybe you should give Mad Men another shot. And that's how they'll hook you. The second episode has a way of luring you into this deep, waking sleep state, where the edges of your surroundings dull and fade, and you start to forget who you are and all of the aspects of your personality that make you even remotely interesting. And the next thing you know, you're on season 5, and you're getting kind of sick of it.

This show has a way of sucking you in. The costumes are fantastic, the sets are fantastic, the acting is well above average, and the characters are, for the most part, very well developed. The plot sort of gets lost in the shuffle. But, maybe that's not as important as we tend to think it has to be. I've enjoyed this show despite all of the reasons I would think that I would hate it.",1422576000,,1448,4.415730337078652

3018950,2,B000YABIQ6,"I bought this series purely on the large number of effusively enthusiastic reviews here.
Somehow it seems I must now ponder as to why I was so easily mislead?

First up I will admit I haven't seen all of it.
I bought Series One through to Six, ...but I believe there is a seventh series being released in two parts?
(Another shameless money grab?)

I'm now nearly three episodes into Series Four, and quite frankly I've had enough.
It is rare for me to abandon something I have so much time invested in, and I have sat through many movies etc. with the ever optimistic thought that it will/must get better. (More than a few ultimate disappointments there too!)

I did keep thinking that anytime now something really engrossing will happen, even just on the odds that writers must eventually think of something gripping, but....nope!
I was reminded of ""The Borgias"", except without all their lovable qualities and their interesting plots, not to mention the better cocktails?

What about a bomb in the water-cooler? Some group same-sex orgy action in the stationery cupboard? Not even a small paper-jamb in the office copier? Or maybe a typist could get a nasty paper cut and we could see a little blood? ......No?

The one outstanding feature that has probably caused me to persist even this far is without doubt the superb art direction.
The wardrobe, the sets, set dressings are all truly wonderful.
The attention to period detail just amazing. FIVE full stars for that aspect!

That having been said,...and I think I have watched enough of this series now not to be accused of not giving the show a fair hearing, but in lieu of any conventional review, I'll just list a series of pertinent questions.
The answers to which others who have ventured, ...enjoyed (endured?) further may like to enlighten me with.

A/ Does anything, anything at all of significance EVER happen in the plot? Ever?

B/ Do the writers ever introduce a character, however marginal, that you might actually care enough about, (or even hate enough would do) to want to see what happens to them? Or are they all useless, vapid and self-obsessed alcoholics right down to the very last man and ""sex-object"" woman?

C/ Is everybody represented in the series such a self-congratulatory total tosser that you really just want to dose their coffee with liberal amounts of thallium rather than watch them back-slap themselves for even one moment longer? (That thought did occur to me! Quite early on too!)

I began to suspect it was one of those snuff-series where you are presented with a cast of really un-likables, all held together by some means and then you enjoy watching as someone, or something, takes them out one by deserving one. It's always great fun deciding who will be the next victim, ...but that didn't happen either.
Hell I'd have killed them all,....and willingly!

D/ Is the very last Season set in some vast Oncology Ward to which the entire cast have been admitted, all with smoking/alcohol related diseases?
I felt like my own lungs were in danger just from watching the billowing clouds! Every actor must have developed at least a 10-pack-a-day habit during the making! The producers are surely in for a few law suits?

Look, I understand there seem to be a lot of maybe-masochists with FAR more endurance skills than I obviously possess, and who like to think there is something really deep-&-meaningful being presented, but I don't watch fictional shows for their deep social realism so much as primarily for entertainment, and this for me fell far short.
I wasn't wanting ""Happy Families"", but I did expect maybe intrigue, backstabbing or even some ruthless jockeying for top position.

Truly I began to increasingly disengage. I just didn't care what happened to any of the useless pack of wannabees, and that always spells the end of things for me.
But as I said perhaps just into Series Four was too early to bail?
That's more than half way through, so how long were the writers planning to hold off?

However I do note with interest a few dissenting voices here in the reviews. Quite a few give even less stars than I'm willing to award, so I may not be the only one somewhat less than captivated with ""Mad Men"", but feel free to agree or disagree.

(I await virulent and personally derisive comment from some guy here on Amazon for whom ANY perceived criticism of this particular show hits his all-too exposed Achilles heel...you'll no doubt recognise him when he shows up! Which he will.)

In short I'd say the potential and possibilities were all there in bucket-loads, but so little was ever exploited by the writing.
Well at least up until where I left off anyway.

This show would be really great for those who tend to doze off occasionally in front of TV, or have to get up to visit the toilet, check on the kids, make the tea or even miss an episode or so for some reason. You'll have no trouble at all picking up where you left off, because the plot will be no further advanced than when you left.",1420502400,4,5004,4.7070938215102975

I'd say the show is highly entertaining and a window into a world that many remember, and others only have heard about.  From the characters, to plot, to music, to authentic background scenes the show is 5 Stars all the way.

What would it be like to be at the top of the advertising world?  This series has tapped into a sub-culture or popular culture that people take for granted.  The show has single-handedly revived an interest in the ""Mad Men"" era and boosted the book sales of marketing legends like David Ogilvy, whose books are not to be missed, whether bought or borrowed from libraries.",1418515200,,662,4.529411764705882

I only caught up with it in ""streaming"" form, after the series had finished on television, and so I was able to consume the episodes like reading a book that's a real page-turner, one right after the other. I couldn't stop. Between the terrific acting and the terrific writing, the deeply complex characterizations and the way the story relates to outside world events of the 1960s, I just ate it up. The blu-rays have fantastic extras -- featurettes on various subjects (different for each season) and commentary for EVERY SHOW by a pair of actors most involved in that episode.

If you're old and gray or feel that way (as I sometimes do mainly because I'm getting old and gray) Mad Men might just be the thing to perk you right up and rekindle thoughts of bygone days and simpler times. Its weird, wild, and wonderful all at once  in its way a fanciful window showing life as it once was in so many ways. In other ways  well, now I don't want to spoil anything!

This I will honestly say: For my nickel, Mad Men is quite possibly one of the greatest things to come along in many years. I would almost say it just might be the Twin Peaks of its age. Though set (for starters) more than 50 years ago in March, 1960, Mad Men is that fresh, that funky  that much pure fun to watch. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a good period drama.",1403481600,,932,3.9946236559139785

Children were expected to say, "":Yes sir or Yes ma'am"" when speaking to adults. Cars were big, heavy and chromed to the max.
Madmen reminds me of that era.  We had our problems and failings....but nothing like the lunacy of today.
Dads worked. Moms usually stayed home and took care of things.  One paycheck was enough for everything...mortgage, car payments, groceries, etc...

I'm so tired of hearing my friends reminisce about the good old 50's.  They were not so great, especially if you were female.  But this show is a sardonic send up of the 50's and a riveting drama and funny.  Absolutely nothing was PC.  If you want a sample, just find an old copy of Life magazine from 1955.  loved the episode when Don and his boss drink a six martini lunch and eat four dozen oysters.

3019248,5,B000YABIQ6,"Overall this is a great series.  The plot lines are amazing and as historically accurate that Hollywood will allow them to be.  The acting is fantastic.  This is one of the best Dramas that I have seen in a VERY LONG TIME.
This first season takes place in about 1960 where the best thing a woman could hope for was senior secretary in the career world of business.  It shows how the main characters, all of which are seriously in need of massive amounts of therapy, deal with their own problems.  Don Draper, the creative head of an advertising agency, is a cheating drunk who has a great amount of talent.  Joan, the senior secretary, is a classic gorgeous female whose biggest hope is land a rich husband, but doesn't realize that she secretly feels empty and desires more out of life.  Peggy Olsen starts out as Don's secretary, but because the office drunk, Freddy, gives credit where credit is due, gets a chance to become more than just a secretary.  Don takes Peggy under his wing because he sees a part of himself in Peggy, ambition and talent with the desire to go outside the traditional roles that society had set for women at that time.  Pete Campbell is the office jerk who has an on-again-off-again relationship with Peggy.  As for the rest of the characters, they are each either unless or screwed up or both as they can be and they try to deal with all of that while navigating the trials and tribulations of adulthood.  Some of things that happen to those characters are interesting, some are funny, and a few are just somewhat weird.
I highly recommend this series to adults who love good dramas, but the underlying subject matter and a few of the basic themes are not suitable for children.",1399939200,,1709,4.552287581699346

3019250,2,B000YABIQ6,"As an admirer and fan of advertising (yes, there's lots of bad stuff that gets out) I'm very disappointed in several different aspects of MADMEN based on my viewing of episode 1.  Watching another episode would be like eating some stinky vegetable I don't like.

First, the dialogue and acting seem very, very contrived, drawn too sharply to feel realistic.  The hints at conflict and complexity in the creative director central character seem like afterthoughts unconnected to any event or storyline in the episode or, future episodes.  The characters, main and minor are overdrawn superficially, from the aspiring twit hot to displace the creative director to the sneering, smoking gynecologist the young woman goes to.

Second, I got the mens' boorish deprecation of women the first time it was offered and found the heavyhanded repetition of this meme over and over and over throughout this episode displaced opportunity to develop more engaging and interesting content -- e.g., deeper details about the creative director's implied internal conflicts or adding some dimensionality to the totally flat character of the young woman employee who has just joined the agency's support staff.  Her co-worker women are portrayed as petty and vindictive with each other in 100% of these vignettes. She seems to have been thrown into a pool of piranha.

Third, the visuals -- sets, setting details, costumes, cinematography -- of this are third rate at best and rarely reach the lower rungs of mediocre.  The scope of the sets is too narrow:  they don't show enough to create an inner sense, feeling of the space, the physical ambience in which the plot (was there a plot?) and characters evolve.  The cheap setting details are incongruent with the economic and influence position of an ad agency as well positioned as this one supposedly is  -- more stereotyping going on even in these visual details.

I'll stop here: no point in boring myself further by thinking about this pitiful parade of visual and social stereotypes.  Now I'm not even sure I can justify the two stars I gave this when I started writing this review.",1399420800,,2119,5.02
3019251,3,B000YABIQ6,"I am not a TV watcher - usually watch Brit mysteries - Morse, etc. on occasion  I like period dramas for the sets as much as the story.

  We started watching this series, we'd heard so many stellar reviews about Mad Men that we were excited to get started. We watched the first episode and right away there was the casual sexual harassment of the female employees and the complete disdain that the men at the ad agency had for their wives, on whom they cheated with with a gleeful locker-room mentality that was just all hardy-har-har-ain't-we-bad-boys. The men were horrible to each other and back stabbings were the order of the day. The wives were catty and cruel, as were the ""girls"" in the secretarial pool.
  There is no character, not one single character, in this series who is sympathetic or likeable or interesting. They're all awful, every last one of them. No one is a true friend. No one is kind. No one seems to have a single worn thread of humanity in them.

This is a story about people who chain-smoke and drink for breakfast and have lots of dishonest sex.  They do this in episode after episode and we actually watched several to see if there was a real story that was going somewhere.  Maybe so, but there are no signs of it.  There are no characters - and no values - to be admired or enjoyed - just a Hollywood clich view of the man in the gray flannel suit living an ugly life with lots of money - the sort of people who would put together this kind of surrealistic ""entertainment"" for the ""masses"".

It's popular, but nonsense often is.  I've lost interest in seeing more.  Lying, cheating, backstabbing while sucking cigarettes and boozing in a corporate skyscraper are simply not that interesting after driving slowly past the first few episodes.",1393804800,14,931,4.6

3019330,4,B000YABIQ6,"I was looking forward to a period piece set in the late 50s and 60s. With the exception of Pam Am which only ran for 1 season (I can see why), the pickings are lean for this period. After all, much more was happening in the late 60s and 70s, so why take the risk? Well done, AMC!

On the surface, it starts off captivating. The sets, costumes and misogynistic mindsets, are spot on. Sure there were a few bloopers : pantyhose was only launched in 1959 and I doubt that mousy Peggy Olsen would have been a trailblazer, in spite of showing backbone and ambition in subsequent series. There are more, if you are really looking.  Rather sit back and enjoy the series - there is so much accurate attention to detail that the odd blunder can be overlooked.

On the surface, it appears to degenerate into just another soapie, but looking deeper, there is a subtlety of character development that is easily missed. The undercurrents in the dialog and lifestyle require your attention. I have often rewound a scene to ensure that I grasped the innuendo.

Season 1's compulsion to have constant smoke filled sets coupled with unlimited drinking borders on subliminal propaganda. It is not realistic and I found it distracting to the point that the rest of what went on became secondary at times. Sure, people smoked and drank a lot in those days, but not everyone, all the time, otherwise they would be too plastered by lunch time time to get any work done. Fortunately this gets toned down in future seasons.

I am currently on Season 3 and still enjoying it. So far, there have been lapses where it languishes in the doldrums for an episode or 3, but overall, it is a refreshing change. Another plus is watching it 7 years after it launched is not a problem - it will never date.",1391904000,,1771,4.521875

3019368,5,B000YABIQ6,"For some reason, I thought this was a comedy series; there are indeed many comedic moments, but this is most definitely a character-based drama. The Madison Avenue Men - Mad Men - inhabit the era of the early 1960's in New York - when drinking, smoking and womanizing defined the advertising industry in New York City. The women in the office are pretty, young things, all secretaries or switch board operators, just making a buck until they find a husband. The Mad Men ogle the office girls, make patronizing comments, call them ""sweetheart"", and generally relegate them to second-class citizen, sex-object status. Though I began my career in the early 1970's, 10 years after Betty Friedan wrote ""The Feminine Mystique"", the aura of workplace discrimination was all too familiar. The costumes and hairstyles may have changed quite a bit over that decade, but the sentiments were largely intact.

Don Draper, a drop dead handsome and suave smooth operator, with an obscure past heads the creative department, and the junior members of the department fear and revere him. He is an enigma, charismatic and appealing, but no one really knows him, least of all his beautiful former-model, perfect wife, Betty, an icy refined blond with an impeccable background. His back-story is revealed in small vignettes throughout the series, and we gradually come to know about his troubled past. Similarly, other characters that seem mono-chromatic at first, are made more multi-dimensional as each episode unfolds. It is this slow progression of revelations, peeled back like the layers of an onion, that make this series so addictive. Nothing is as it seems at first; the world is infinitely more complicated than it seems at first, even in 1960; happiness and security are elusive - even for the Mad Men.

The sets, both in the office and home, are perfectly detailed for the era, down to the same frosted cocktail glasses that I remember my parents owning. The wardrobe, hair styles and makeup are all flawlessly executed - a step back in time to 1960. I will definitely keep tuning in for subsequent seasons.",1390608000,,2099,4.994285714285715

3019412,5,B000YABIQ6,"The 52 episodes of ""Mad Men"" Seasons 1 Through 4 constitutes a sort of masterpiece in TV mini-series.  What makes it so good are the subject matter, casting, care in creating the early-60s atmosphere, and the unity and consistency that comes from a single person (in this case Matt Weiner) having co-authorship in every episode.  Such a mini-series is to a 2-hour movie as a novel is to a short story.

The main subject is the self-awakening of Dan Draper, the creative head of the concepts department of a Madison Avenue advertising firm.  Dan Draper is played by Jon Hamm, a very good actor with a lot of live-theater experience.  Hamm is a commanding presence, looks the part, and is up to the challenges of this demanding role.  Dan Draper is a talented man functioning brilliantly in his professional career, but he is an alcoholic, a dysfunctional husband (although a reasonably good father), and a compulsive womanizer.  We learn, as he learns, from his mental flashbacks that occur from time to time, that he is a man escaping from a very difficult childhood.  We root for him despite his flaws because he is troubled and displays an innate decency at key moments.  By the end of series 4 he has achieved a certain level of self-awareness, and we the audience have been on an interesting journey.

Personally, I think they should have stopped with series 4, but that's a different story.

The rest of the ensemble cast is generally excellent.  There are many interesting sub-plots.  We follow the rise from secretary to Dan Draper's co-worker of Peggy.  Its a struggle all the way for her in the pre-Feminist world of the early 60s.

I have the Blu-ray versions of seasons 1 through 4, which I purchased individual.  Each season is 13 episodes spread across 3 Blu-ray discs.  The picture quality and sound quality are fine.  There is an optional commentary track for each episode.  The presentation is fine.",1388534400,,1915,4.783536585365853
3019413,5,B000YABIQ6,"Just finished watching season 1. While the first two episodes do not give much, the series starts to drive your attention to the characters on the third episode. The end of the season was a surprise as we'll.",1388275200,,208,4.5
3019414,5,B000YABIQ6,"I always feel like I was born too late.  After watching the first episode of Mad Men, Season One -- I think it's confirmed.  Drinking in the office from 9am on?  People smoking indoors with no regard for common decency?  Sexually harassing one's secretary, and it just being considered commonplace to cheat on one's wife?  Don Draper doesn't bat an eyelash at these things, and moves through life as if a psychopath only concerned with his own well-being.  I also liked how his wife didn't ask any questions when he told her that he decided to ""Stay in the city"" the last couple nights, without even so much as a phone call.  There is zero expectation that he will contribute to caring for his child also.  Needless to say if I attempted any of these things, my wife would have me drawn and quartered.  Living vicariously through Don Draper in this show is now going to be one of the few pleasures I have in my sad life as a neutered American male -- living in the culture that we have created for ourselves, like a self-made cage.  In Draper's time, men were men indeed.",1388102400,,1071,4.446153846153846

3019493,5,B000YABIQ6,"""Mad Men Season 1"" caught my attention because of my fascination with the public relations world and the story being based on the career symbolism of advertising (which is indirectly related to public relations).  I unexpectedly learned the various ways that media and other various outlets can have subtle influence.  It was also important for me to watch the first season in order to help me further understand the other seasons of Mad Men that I intend to watch. The following are some of the various facets of the season 1 that piqued my interest and made the characters relatable and series worthwhile to watch:
The characters of Don Draper, Betty Draper, and Rachel Menken have all experienced what it feels like to lose their mothers to physical death. Additionally, the character of Don Draper had to secretly carry the societal stigma of his late biological mother being a prostitute. I also liked how Betty Draper was portrayed as a dynamic woman who adores both her children and husband but yearns for a life of her own outside the home. I feel that this portrayal is realistic due to my own personal experiences of observing my late adoptive mother until I was 18 years old. She dearly loved my siblings and me as well as my adoptive father. However, I frequently noticed that her face lit up more during the time periods in her life when she had to get ready for work.
Watching the characters of Joan Holloway giving career advice to Peggy Olson made gave the series a great touch because both women were carefully navigating their professional lives while dealing with workplace sexual harassment. The Progressive Car Insurance lady (Stephanie Courtney) and Darby Stanchfield (from the TV series Scandal) also make appearances during Mad Men season 1.
The following pop culture references are among those mentioned in Mad Mean season 1: Lady Chatterley, Sara Lee cake, Atlas Shrugged, Mad magazine, Rosetta Stone, and Clearasil.
Mad Men Season 1 is a fascinating series to watch for those who are either interested in American culture from the 1960's, enjoy watching drama series, and/or those curious about the world of advertising.",1382140800,,2147,4.944598337950138

3019495,5,B000YABIQ6,I needed some shows to watch on a long flight so I downloaded the first season.  It got me hooked and I had a hard time finding time to watch all the newer seasons since I was 6 seasons behind and the episodes are about 47 minutes and there is about 13 episodes per season.,1380844800,,273,3.963636363636364
3019496,5,B000YABIQ6,"Setting in the late 50's and early 60's when I grew up, it is so real to that time about the ad men of Madison Ave. So real on how women were treated in the work place and the lack of respect. It is such good dirt and who isn't in love with Don Draper?!!
Should have won the Emmy's in all categories. Thank you for prompt mailing.",1380585600,,330,3.8676470588235294
3019497,3,B000YABIQ6,"Madmen Season One is fun, mainly on a stylistic level.  I love the opening credits sequence. The series is an almost-faithful recreation of the visual style and culture of the early 1960s.

I say almost-faithful because the inaccuracies can be a little jarring.  I lived through the 60s and remember the decade clearly. The errors are a little irritating, and were bad enough to keep taking me out of the reality of the storyline.

The timeline is a little loopy.  It's 1960, then it seems to be years later, in terms of what's going on culturally in the U.S., then it's 1960 again.  They really needed a consultant who lived through the decade, connect the dots of what happened when and what caused what to happen, because the first season at least was a mishmash with some things out of order.  And they were important things.  It's as if someone were making a movie about the first decade of the 21st century, and set the events of 9-11 after, not before, the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, or showed Obama elected before George Bush, or showed texting preceding email.

Beatniks were not hippies.  The first season was set in 1960, before Kennedy's election, and shows the main character meeting a bunch of beatniks, but most of them are portrayed as hippies, not beatniks.  But hippies of the type portayed were a reaction to the Vietnam war and the Kennedy assassination, which did not occur, obviously, before Kennedy was elected to office. Nixon lost partly because he didn't listen to admen.  Marshall McLuhan published ""The media is the message"" in the mid 60s, so people would not be talking about it years earlier. The visual style of the ads the admen are creating, is more reminiscent of the mid 50s than the 60s.  The problem is that ""one thing leads to another,"" so getting the order wrong makes the show lose its sense of reality on a certain level.  The producers went to such trouble to get some things right, the things they got wrong are a little jarring.",1379721600,3,1981,4.655172413793103

3019534,5,B000YABIQ6,"I remember when this show started. I heard such amazing things about it. I went to find it on my TV - no luck. I didn't get AMC on my satellite package. Darn! I had to live with all of the buzz swirling around me. Thank heavens for my Entertainment Weekly or I wouldn't even know the basics.

Now I have been given the opportunity to see the very first season of Mad Men and I can say I now understand what all that fuss was about. I can't say that I fell in love from the very first episode - boy that Don Draper can be a louse! But then the show grew on me as I watched. It's complicated, very, very complicated. And I like that. Hard to believe that women were treated that way, eh? So glad I came of age in a slightly later time.

The acting is so smooth I got caught up in the show and at times was quite lost in what was going on. I love when that happens; it's much rarer with television than it is with a book for me and quite a surprise when it does happen. I loved how each episode ended with a little shock to the system so that you were left quite anxious for the next one to begin.

3019539,5,B000YABIQ6,"I only learned of this show at the beginning of the 6th season and enjoyed it so much my wife and I ordered the 1st season to catch up. This show reminds us of how the word 'class' got its name. The writers have created stories that leave you fully engaged, and have reminded us of things we take for granted. Take for instance the introduction of going to work dressed to impress! And how about the time when people used electric typewriters! I never heard of John Hamm before, but I'm sure we'll be seeing and hearing much more of him.

He plays the part of a man with a plan to the hilt. The trouble is, he has a past he is running away from, and as he states in an episode with someone from his past, ""There's only one direction my life is moving, and that's forward."" The show also reminds us of the introduction of popular ads we now view as commonplace. There's Lucky Strikes, coffee brands, women's clothing. They've obviously done their research because I feel renewed pride in my work from watching how this show reflects we all have an important role in what we do, only sometimes need to be reminded. This show not only entertains you, but for me has reminded me where I've been and where I am now, and what's more, I can be proud of who I am.

There are alot of good qualities to the show - the acting is above average, the setting and costumes. I find one or 2 of the characters interesting in an odd way (Draper and Campbell) but for the most part the characters are pretty stereotypical of what I would have expected to find in the 60s era soap opera. T I will admit episode 12 with all the masturbatory references was a hoot. I was getting interested in the subplot with Don's mysterious past but they've already put that to bed. Maybe it'll come back but the mystery is gone.

I guess I was hoping to be hooked like everyone else. But overall, I find there to be too little action and a repetition of the same plot points from episode to episode.",1374537600,,825,4.427631578947368

3019714,3,B000YABIQ6,"Having heard people talking about Mad Men, I finally broke down and ordered Season 1 on Amazon. Watched a few episodes every week. First off, be prepared for a look at 1960 that is very reflexive, meaning it distills the worst of the era into bits so repetitive that it becomes annoying. Everyone smokes in every scene (almost). Same for the drinking. Same for the racism, misogyny, and other characteristics. Certainly these evils existed, but to hit them with a sledgehammer every time distracts from the storyline. That said, there are many redeeming qualities of this show. Don Draper is an ad exec facing his own demons and an upstart exec. Don's wife and her girlfriends live in the homemaker life, casting a wary eye on a divorce neighbor.

3019775,3,B000YABIQ6,"I've watched just about the whole series on Netflix. It's interesting only for its nostalgic value (because I hail from that period and have worked on Madison Avenue) but oddly it doesn't cause nostalgia in me because there's a modern, contemporary element in the series, in all the characters and in the various episodes (and it has a billion and a half directors for each episode), that sours it. I've reached Season 4, episode 13, and was not surprised to see the anti-cigarette ploy. I don't particularly like the character of Don Draper aka Dick Whitman; he doesn't seem to have a self because of his dishonesty in stealing Whitman's identity in Korea. He's too angst-ridden and has a continuing series of problems that seem pretty banal. You really don't know why he has all the sex he does (and he has almost as many women as he has cigarettes and bourbons and whiskeys, practically nonstop) and it's never explained why he needs sex so much.

Jon Hamm would be a great Hank Rearden, the industrialist, in a remake of Atlas Shrugged, if the people in charge of casting for that disaster had any marbles. But as Don Draper, he's just literally a selfless entity in search of a self. As a slice of lavishly produced Naturalism, the series is marvelously cast and otherwise well done. It doesn't hold a candle, however, to movies that deal with internal conflicts such as ""Leave Her to Heaven."" One thing I do miss and which the series recreates is the women's clothing styles, which were sexier.",1367452800,,1500,4.7034220532319395

3019779,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men caught my eye as soon as I read that it was set in the 1960's.  Ah, the 1960's. I was 10 in 1960; graduated from high school in 1968.  Watching this television show brings back not only my childhood, but my teenage years as well.  Everything from Selectric typewriters, to switchboards, phones with blinking buttons, eating raw hamburger, and living with parents that smoked and drank as a normal part of life. Add to that list driving drunk, driving without seat belts, kids playing with plastic bags over their head, pregnant women drinking and smoking, and other shocking behavior to curl our toes.

Set in New York City in the heyday of advertising agencies in Manhattan, it's an eclectic weave of husbands, housewives, mistresses, secretaries, office politics, and account executives.  It reminds me of those days when anything went.  Men made sexual innuendos to the female office staff, booze was in the offices, and everyone smoked like a chimney. My first time someone flirted with me at my second job in 1969, the bank manager came up and told me I had ""great legs.""  Then in 1972 my boss had me stay late one night and came up behind me and grabbed my breasts.  Wow, I could have sued had that happened today.

On top of the outlandish days of sexual harassment in the office, it's mixed with the occurrence of segregation where Negros couldn't ride in the elevators with the working staff unless given permission.  Everyone in the company was white - no mixing of the races like our modern offices today.  Jewish people were treated like aliens that couldn't be understood.  Everyone drank and smoked.  I can remember my first boss in 1968 having a bottle of booze stashed in his desk drawer.  Most of the day he smelled of alcohol.

Then there were the women who stayed home - the housewives.  Always with their hair in place, their bouncy little dresses, their kids clean, their houses spotless, and dinner waiting on the table when their husbands came home.  They knew their place, and they kept their place whether they were miserable or happy. It was their way of life, along with eating prime rib and butter for dinner.  The men, of course, lived doubled lives of carousing with other women and having mistresses on the side in or out of the office setting. Married women, who met a divorced woman with two children living alone, was an unthinkable state of affairs.

The characters are wonderful, with their own back story of how their childhood and family has molded them into the adults they have become.  Each have their own personal struggles, whether it be with self-worth, a family they wish to forget, a wife with whom they are estranged, an overbearing mother who filled their daughters with expectations, or a father who doesn't support their son's career choice.  The stories are rich in their own right and filled with everybody's pursuit of happiness in the 60's, in one way or the other. Rather than worrying about their smoking, drinking, or butter on their plates, the Communists are the threats, as well as the thought of having a Catholic president.

I can't tell you how utterly entertaining this show is, at least for me.  If you didn't grow up in that era, you'll probably find it very strange.  If you did, it will be like walking down memory lane, remembering your childhood, and no doubt your parents.  I can still see my mother who wore a dress every day, had dinner on the table, who hadn't worked out of the home since World War II.  Yes, we have evolved in many ways.  Discrimination and sexism in the office is a thing of the past.  Feminism has taken the women out of the homes and made them executives along side men.  However, a part of me misses the simplicity of those days when life had different complications than we face today.

One of my favorites are the girls in the office and how they share the gossip.  A particular scene that had me rolling on the floor happened to be when one lady pulled from her purse the novel, ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" and the women started talking about it.  Of course, it's strictly taboo to read such a book that uses the words no lady would utter and contain such graphic sexual scenes in a book!  One woman asks if she can borrow it to read, and the advice was priceless.  ""Don't read it on the train.  It will attract all the wrong elements.""  What a hoot!  Reminded me of today and women reading Fifty Shades of Grey in public.  Things never really change in some aspects.  We just color it in a different light.

Anyway, highly recommend the show.",1365897600,,4550,4.617683686176837

3019833,2,B000YABIQ6,"I grew up in the sixties and so watching this show is a blast in many ways {My mom dressed like that!  We had a clock like that!  Oh, the awesome black telephone that I'm convinced is still a better piece of equipment than anything you could buy today).  And yes, contrary to what some reviewers think, people DID smoke like that; my childhood was spent in a smoke-filled haze, and the ashtrays were just as gross as we see on the show.  The producers recreate the early 60s in a very believable way.

The acting is good, although the pacing can be a bit slow, but I can live with that as it takes time to plot out a compelling story.  My two main problems with the show are strictly a matter of personal taste:  I cannot get past that there are no truly likeable characters on the show (I need to be able to root for at least one person) and also I do not like its graphic nature - I don't want to see a ""put your knees apart"" gynecological exam complete with speculum thrown in for good measure, Draper pulling up his fly then flushing the toilet, and most emphatically the ad exec who regurgitates in front of his colleagues after walking up multiple flights of stairs.  I was midway through season one when I had to suffer that last gem.  That's just gross, and gratuitous; we could still have gotten the idea of what happened without it literally being pictured out.

3019878,5,B000YABIQ6,"How can I hope to say anything which has not already been said about this AMC series in over 450 reviews. I can only add my personal reactions. I have been avoiding it for several seasons, since I found the relation between men and women quite disturbing, in spite of the fact that I lived through that early '60s era, but in a somewhat lower class family, where my mother worked in a factory and my father in the steel mills. I was also a bit turned off by the time spend in the bedroom rather than the board room. I loved ""The West Wing"" because, among other things, it demonstrated how power was far more exciting than sex, and I thought that the new series ""Suits"" did the same thing. But, after seeing none of my USA, TNT, and TBS series win any awards, and the AMC series raking them in like Hershey Kisses, I thought it was time to give this a try. A nudge from my Facebook friend Esther Schindler didn't hurt.

So, I have discovered that the pace, the dialoge, the characters, and the situations, all framed with superior writing and good acting, really draws me into this world, in spite of its air of testosterone out of control, where the only thing the men want to do with all the women they meet is to get them into the sack. That's an exaggeration, of course, but it happens far more than most other series this side of Californication.

If I had any complaints, it would be that there are very few really satisfying conclusions to the story arcs. One gets the feeling that the big climax will come with the series finale, similar to Josh Lyman and Donna Moss finally hooking up in the next to last episode of ""The West Wing."" Closing deals with clients just doesn't give me a great deal of satisfaction. There are personal crises, but everything is so low key, one is reminded of how empty people's lives seemed to be before the great cultural revolution of 1964. On the bright side, I am positively looking forward to watching the next season to see how things work out.

It's interesting to compare John Hamm with Gabriel Macht of ""Suits"". Both characters are eminantly skilled at their jobs, and comfortable in their own skins. But ""Mad Men's"" Don Draper is understated while ""Suits"" Harvey Specter is arrogant and just a bit blind to his weaknesses.",1361232000,6,2268,4.473429951690822

3019933,4,B000YABIQ6,"I've always hated Mad Men. I never had to spend even five minutes with the show to know I wouldn't like it.

This seems almost paradoxical, seeing as how the show consists of elements that I love and have so longed to see in popular entertainment. From everything I heard, it was a mature, character-driven drama that strips away the sepia-toned nostalgia of a bygone time in America, addressing the racism, sexism and other eyebrow-furrowing quirks of the 1960s.

Not to mention the fact it stars Jon Hamm and Cristina Hendricks, who have both won me over in their own ways. I've never seen much of Hamm's actual work as an actor, but I've witnessed him handsome his way through interviews, and I can't deny his charm is undeniable. And Hendricks? I've been in love with her since I first got a glimpse of her talent in ""Firefly.""

So, by all accounts, it seems like this is something I would instantly fall in love with, if only I would give it the chance, like how I felt in high school every time a girl laughed before saying she had ""other plans"" Friday night.

""But, that's stupid,"" you say out loud to yourself as you read this, ""why would you form an opinion about something you haven't experienced?""

""The same reason I never leave the house and don't trust the young people,"" I respond. ""I'm an old man.""

The reason I had never before given the show a chance was because of my friend, Dalton, who has been obsessed with the show since it first premiered, has pestered me about checking it out since day one, and, just because I knew it would drive him crazy, I've stayed as far away from it as possible.

Well, I finally watched it. And I loved it. And I hate that I loved it

Why? Because now I'm forced to face the fact that Dalton was right all along, and, despite my best efforts, I've been won over.

Watching the first episode of the series, ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"" was a great and painful experience, because I wanted it to fail and I wanted the credits to roll and be able to text him and brag about how much it sucked. But I couldn't. And I hated it.

I hated the incredible performances and deeply-drawn characters that sucked me in and made me care. I hated the well-structured plot that had me anticipating how it would all get resolved. I hated the detailed scenery, I hated the wonderful  costumes, I hated the beautiful framing for the striking visuals.

I hated everything that made me love it, and now I hate myself because I'm looking forward to more.",1360022400,2,2483,4.4449339207048455

This show reminds us that the 1950's-1960's were not the ""good old days"".  Thank God we have gotten more enlightened regarding equality of race and sex and there are more opportunities for both.  I don't remember my mother and her friends being as vacuous as the women here, however, so applaud them.

It's a delight to see how uncannily the era is replicated in attitudes and atmosphere.  The production values, camera shots, lighting and staging are brilliant.  And the actors don't overplay their roles; the timing is impeccable.  Each show is addictive--you can't wait to see what is going to transpire next as the mystery of their lives and relationships starts to reveal itself.

I love watching this on the treadmill as the show is so captivating, time passes quickly.

The series has lost its greatness in later seasons but they produced the two best seasons I have seen on television in their first two. Warning: the show is addictive. Four episodes at a time hardly satisfied me. Second warning: I admit to buying martini glasses and drinking midday to this show.

Favorite episodes:

The Hobo Code
The Wheel

3020057,5,B000YABIQ6,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones as Don's wife), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 1. There are four more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

3020094,4,B000YABIQ6,"Season One of Mad Men was probably its best. The writing had a huge amount of attention to detail (note Don's ""Carousel"" pitch), the writers and actors had more freedom to develop their characters because they were starting with a blank slate, and the story line was more tightly focused than it was in subsequent seasons. Also, because of directions that writers took in subsequent years, this season had the characters at their most likeable. While that may be unrealistic, and Mad Men is, after all, striving for faux-realism, it made for more compelling viewing and we not only wanted to watch the characters, we wanted them to be happy.

The sets are gorgeous, the fashion is intriguing, and the plots make sense. This was Mad Men at its peak.",1350172800,,748,4.753846153846154
3020095,4,B000YABIQ6,"I got this for my Girlfriend because she was instantly hooked. I however, was not. While I think the set's are great (most of the show is on sets I assume because it would be too costly to make the outside world look like 1960) the costumes sharp, the acting superb and the cinematography is better than most shows, I am not compelled by the melodrama of the characters. I think if you stripped away the charm of the '60's and made this a contemporary show, it would be like Desperate Housewives. The stories and arch of the characters really aren't that important, mainly trivial except to the characters themselves. This is not a bad show, it's better than most other shows on tv. I just don't think it's as amazing as other shows. I think shows like Breaking Bad and The Wire do/did a better job of making melodrama seem more important and less trivial by weaving them together better and over a more grand arch. On Blu-Ray this show looks immaculate. Detail is sharp and crisp, black levels are deep, and colors are vibrant and pop onscreen. If you like AMC shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad or more dramatic shows like Game Of Thrones or The Wire, then I think you'll like this show too, but you'll also realize that those shows do a better job of making melodrama compelling and more interesting. Hopefully further seasons of the show flesh out more interesting and compelling stories that are a bit more entertaining.

3020145,3,B000YABIQ6,"After having heard a lot of hype about how great Mad Men was, I decided I'd give the show a try--right from the beginning, which is generally where I like to start things.

I finished the first season last night, and I find myself in a position of neither loving or hating the show. Just a feeling of supreme ambivalence, and a healthy dose of disappointment. What can I say? The acting is solid, the wardrobes are gorgeous and so are the elaborate sets. Mad Men exudes an aura of the sixties, completely with music and the omnipresent haze of cigarette smoke.

Unfortunately, once you get beyond the pretty packaging, there's not much there. The characters seem to be vying with each other for how unsympathetic they can become, and many of the plot lines(particularly those involving the main character, Don Draper) just don't hold together. I had expected the advertising world to provide much of the drama, but the show hops and skips from one client to the next, often with no resolution.

Another issue is timeline--there is no coherent sense of time or exactly what's going on. Sometimes an episode covers a single day. . .and then the next episode picks up six months later, and you learn that the affair which was ""never going to happen"" in that episode, has been going on for the entire six months. It's very jarring.

Tobacco and liquor companies must have financed 90% of this because it seems there's never 30 seconds without someone overindulging onscreen.",1344816000,,462,4.9480519480519485

3020189,5,B000YABIQ6,"MAD MEN is currently moving into its sixth season, and it's unlikely that you haven't heard of it by now. I managed to go this long without watching a single episode or learning a single thing about any of its characters or events. I had, of course, heard of the rave reviews, but the concept (the lives and times of advertising executives in Manhattan) didn't really interest me. Also, I'm generally of the sort that if something has massively wide appeal (see: Twilight), then I'm probably not going to like it. I'm not an elitist; I just find that wildly popular entertainment has usually been dumbed down to have broader draw.

At the insistence of friends and family, I finally sat down to watch the first season of this much-lauded show, and -- I won't lie -- I immediately hated it. The characters are pretty much all despicable. The men are obnoxious adulterers. The women are either hollow, petulant shells or obvious caricatures of sexuality for the men to gape and paw at. Right off the bat, the central character -- a charismatic and mysterious advertising executive named Don Draper -- falls madly in love with a rich Jewess he has just met. ""What the?"" I said. ""Has he met her before?"" By the third episode, I was ready to call it quits.

I'm so glad I didn't.

It is easy to get tied up in concepts like story and entertainment, but it is so rare to find subtlety, depth, and brilliance in primetime television that I have often stopped looking for them. The more I watched this show, though, the more I realized that there was a true craft at work. Not only is every element ingeniously placed and crafted -- from the soundtrack, costumes, backdrops, asides, cultural references, and glances -- but it is done so in such a way that, even if you aren't aware of them, you can't help but appreciate them. What a joy to finally find a work of art -- and, yes, this show is certainly a work of art -- that actively finagles its way into your braincells. You can focus on superficialities such as whose doing what (or whom) and where the plot is headed, but you will soon find yourself (if even subconsciously) noting how perfectly those larger elements mesh with the show's less overt environment.

I was initially distracted by the truly selfish, lazy, and loathsome attitudes of the show's main characters, but I see now that they are representations of American culture as it was, wants to be, and even is today. The show's themes -- success, happiness, love, hope, and commercialism -- are never pounded into the scripts or set pieces, and yet they are so achingly resonant that I ended each episode with a tingle in my neck and an immediate desire to watch it again. It is nearly impossible to watch one without feeling as if there were parts -- important or not -- that slipped your notice or that you would love to go back and fully learn how to relish. Everything from the acting, dialogue, and subject matter ties together in a way that, well, that I don't know if I've ever seen on TV before.

Watch it. If you're like me, and you're holding out, you've no reason to. Seriously. Watch it. Then watch it again. It really is that good.",1343779200,4,3155,4.537785588752197

3020196,5,B000YABIQ6,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The first season of ""Mad Men,"" American Movie Classics' original flagship drama, beautifully lays out the involved dramatic satire in its thirteen episodes.  Featuring one of the most versatile ensemble casts on television, the show is remarkable for providing genuine entertainment while also providing very thoughtful material for the intellect.

Centering on the fictitious ad agency Sterling Cooper and its charmingly egotistical top creative mind Don Draper(Jon Hamm in an iconic performance), the show satirizes the image of clean early 1960's America by highlighting masculine sexual dominance in the office and strongly patriarchal gender roles in the home.  A fairly sharp postmodern repudiation of that era of American culture, the show is incisive in having little or no ties to modern America.  Instead, the actions of a character can make an in-the-moment critique of a given stuation, and it imbues the show with a sense of timelessness.

Character development drives the show, whether in the workplace or in the Draper household.  Robert Morse is excellent as Bert Cooper, a slightly gentler counterpoint to John Slattery's loutish Roger Sterling.  Vincent Kartheiser makes an indelible impression as ruthless young business shark Peter Campbell, and Elisabeth Moss is perfect as Peggy Olson, a sharp young secretary who wants more for herself.  Also noteworthy in the cast is a pitch-perfect January Jones as Betty Draper.

The Blu-Ray picture and sound is extremely sharp.  The package also includes informative extra featurettes on the period, and thorough commentaries by cast and crew on every Season One episode.

The season also unfolds a compelling mystery regarding Don Draper's identity.  Episode highlights are ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" ""Babylon,"" ""Red In The Face,"" and ""Nixon VS. Kennedy.""  Season One of ""Mad Men"" announces itself as a rare animal, a period drama with incisively salient points to make on contemorary society.",1338595200,2,1972,5.444078947368421

3020240,1,B000YABIQ6,"After enjoying the Sopranos for a few years I was hungry for something of equal quality. Rich, true, complex story telling. I'm sure like many others I was led to Mad Men. Indeed as anyone can see it has lavish, rich, tip-top professional production values. I didn't like Don Draper 1/4th as much as Tony Soprano but you can't have everything. It's like they combed the world to find a Jack Kerouac clone but this one is in advertising. No matter. He has his fans. Still there is the enchanting and beautiful Christina Hendricks playing Joan Harris and the, ""you can't keep your eyes off her"" beautiful January Jones playing Betty Draper. But here's the thing. I have read how the creator of this show, Matthew Weiner says it would just be a joke if smoking were not included in this retro show. But this is 2012 not 1963 and we know that such relentless use and glamorizing of smoking (to say nothing of drinking the hard stuff at every possible turn) will, when seen my millions of people will greatly promote smoking which we know very well will lead to grisly miserable death of hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands. Yes there is smoking on the Sopranos but the brilliant David Chase has one character nearly coughing to death as he gets another cigarette driving a car and Mr. Sack the New York boss is dying of cancer and says how he had just quit. Mad Men? Well there is Betty Draper very, very pregnant (in season 3) smoking and her father says for her to stop, he doesn't want to see her commit suicide. Then a moment later he says for her to go ahead. Meanwhile, later, he is seen shaking salt on his ice cream and drops dead the every next episode. As if, look! See! People do all kinds of risky behaviors like salting ice cream. I'm merely saying they can have all the smoking they wish but it could be presented in such a way that would discourage people from smoking rather then what this show does. There is no excuse for this ""willful blindness"". This is a huge promotion and love song to cigarette smoking and hard drinking and there is a net effect. Profits for them, very happy tobacco executives and a lot of dead people that merely flipped on the T.V. one day. Matthew Weiner, Scott Hornbacher, Maria and Andre Jacquemetton, Black McCormick, Christopher Manley, Jon Mamm, January Jones and the rest that directly showcase smoking belong in jail not on TV.",1335830400,6,2390,4.521939953810624

Although you may need the Commentaries to find out who some of the main actors are,if you never watched it on TV, and if you intend to listen to the Commentaries, I would recommend watching the 13 episodes first and then going back and listen to the Commentaries. These Commentaries are pretty episode-specific for the most part, so it may be hard to remember exactly what happened in an episode that way, but it is better than having the future episodes spoiled to an extent before you get to them. Because there was so much going on in each episode, they were not completely ruined, but it would have been better if the future plots were kept under wraps as they said they were during the actual first season run, and talking only about that or previous episodes.

3020289,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is the first television series I've seen that feels like a theatrical movie rather than another jittery, overly busy, manipulative made-for-TV video series, with frequently good acting wasted on formulaic, or non-existent, plots (the ""criminal minds"" of the series by that title are the writers) relying upon sensation, violence, and cheap digital effects to hook and maintain the viewer's interest. Moreover, the characters in ""Mad Men"" are not cardboard stereotypes but multidimensional and complex.  But perhaps not as much as they would like to think.  Women viewers need not feel guilty about watching ""Mad Men"" on the basis of the following features designed to attract a large female audience: the compelling if not magnetic quality of the flawed but strong and reassuringly handsome lead, John Hamm, who plays ultra-cool ad man Don Draper (he's got the right charisma to anchor an entire James Bond movie series); the representation of women in the 1960's, a period that requires a woman to be at once a ""toy doll,"" a ""perfect housewife,"" and of course, an unquestionably competent secretary, who has nothing but time on her hands to perform her duties with unfailing mechanical precision, always ready with the proper smile or facial expression at the proper time (or risk being fired, and without the ceremony offered incompetent male employees).

Needless to say, the women who ""succeed"" are those who are, by the unspoken requirements of their subordinate position, academy-award winning actresses, capable of either a. landing a man who is a paid ticket to a suburban castle with charming children (and servants to smooth out life's ruffles) or b. miraculously carving out a place where they are recognized for their actual abilities, talents and individual potential.  The slights inflicted upon women on a continual basis are subtle and cumulative.  Like the series itself, the duplicity required of women to succeed, or simply to survive, in the work place becomes manifest gradually, requiring the viewer to pay close attention to the smallest details of dialogue and ""mis en scene"" (by contrast, most television series make NO demands of their viewers because there's ""nothing to look at"": in the overwhelming majority of television dramas the moving camera and shock editing is relentless, continually loud and intrusive of the home spectator's viewing space: in television, it seems, ""overstatement"" rules, giving the viewer no room for choice let alone interpretation. The medium behaves as though its only mission is, as quickly and as surely as possible, to ""captivate"" a witless audience that will think and feel as the camera and sound-track dictate.  ""Mad Man"" is, by contrast, an imitation of a far more recognizable life, one offering inscrutable, even dangerous ""games"" to every individual who's in the job market, desperate for a good job with benefits and opportunities for advancement but damned if he allows the urgency to show.  Moreover, the series is undeniably, from its first smoke-filled shots, a ""period piece"" that represents the '60s as some of us will certainly (if reluctantly) remember those years.  But it's more than a disturbing view of the past: it's a critique of the unexamined life and, necessarily, of the life of commercial television in the present age of ""late""-capitalism, when even the most under-educated viewers are becoming increasingly aware of the unbreachable divide between the haves and the have-nots, between those who exploit and profit from the desires of the American consumer and those suddenly made aware of the high cost of the American Dream and its increasing distance from the vast majority.

You may need to pick up the series for rescreening if, to select a chapter at random, you missed the following in Episode 7, ""Red in the Face"":  The subtle collusion between Don and the elevator operator to assure the unforgettable climax of Roger's humiliation.  Notice Don's brief business with him both before and after the oysterfest, and notice the expressions on Roger's and Don's faces at the end of the episode.  Besides such details, consider the overaching design of the episode.  The theme is male predators, survival of the fittest, and misplaced hubris.  Roger will hit on Betty Draper, and the pathetic Pete will do the same with the store clerk who refuses to refund in cash his returned chip and dip.  Both come up empty-handed, though both try to sustain their moment of heroism.  Pete's sitting Peggy down on a couch to hear his story of gutting a rabbit and eating it in view of the fair damsel is parallell with Roger's stories to the overly appreciative (in Don's double-standard view)  Betty.  Then we have the chivalric subtheme of Betsy playing the fair princess to the unlikely 8-year-old knight whose mother's negligence leads to his coveting a lock of Betty's golden hair.  It's a rare moment when Betty is both the object of adoration and an empathetic mother who reaches out (which she can't do with her own family).  But just as Don blames her for Roger's bad behavior, the suddenly possessive mother of the wandering knight takes offense at Betty's gift.  As usual, she's sent back to the psychiatrist, though the planting of the rifle as Pete's new toy will take its rightful place in the story when Betsy takes a gun to the neighbor's pidgeons.  It's a moment of rage that is long overdue.

Along with the examination of the pressure-cooker capitalism, the series is especially concerned with the roles demanded of (and therefore ""played by"") women.  The seeds are being planted throughout the entire first season, but the fully realized force of the objectification and belittlement of women (nothing so obvious as ""harassment"") will culminate in a chilling, unforgettable and appropriately titled episode, ""A Night to Remember,"" in the 2nd season (episode 8 from the 2008 season). The episode is a cinematic tour deforce, thus far the most ambitious chapter in a series that seems to be reinventing itself as it goes along, always improving. This particular segment is like vintage Robert Altman in its cross-cutting among the three women who have received the most attention. The time, historically, is the days immediately following news of Marilyn Monroe's suicide, and each of the three women--Joan, the queen-secretary who is herself a combination of keen intelligence in an hour-glass figure; Betty, the manipulated, blonde showgirl/perfect housewife/showcase trophy of Don Draper; Peggy, the innocent ""country girl"" who has wised-up sufficiently to the ways of men to play their game, attaining power to make decisions that will influence consumers throughout the nation--each of the three will receive potentially shattering epiphanies, showing them the emptiness of their programmed existences in a male-run world that expects of them only compliance along with adoration beyond any they themselves might receive for their physical attributes.  The realizations of all three occur in a breath-taking ""tour de force"" of characterization. The potent mix of minimalist but thoughtful script-writing, artful directing, and ""parallel"" editing allows the viewer to receive the full force of three separate ""actions"" (actually, internal ""epiphanies"") occurring simultaneously.

The series is uncomfortably faithful to the period, not only in its portrayal of male-female relationships in and outside the workplace but in the continuous gauzy veil of smoke thrown off by chain-smoking characters along with the ubiquitous portable bars in the offices of hard-drinking executives (just a few examples of the irony of the ad squad coming under the influence of its own subliminal messages).  Most of the action is internal yet highly appealing to the eye, taking place in an office space that seems both capacious and capable of showing the viewer surprises and new discoveries with each episode. The colors are richly saturated--crisp and vibrant technicolor (not the faded, irridescent reds, blues, and greens that would replace them beginning in the late '60s and continuing throughout the 1970s), with a brightly lit, crystal clear, sharp resolution and a camera lens with revealing ""depth of field"" that takes full advantage of the big flat, high definition screens that have begun to dominate domestic space in just the past 5-6 years of the new millennium; the camera work--with striking angles but steady shots of sufficient duration to allow the spectator to see each crucial detail--has the professional sheen of a bonafide ""auteur"" such as the admired 1950s ""Hollywood"" director, Douglas Sirk.

Frankly, I had all but ""given up"" on television--except for the talking heads on MSNBC and the mindless reality shows like ""Pawn Stars"" and ""American Pickers.""  Most of what passes for television drama is manipulative and ""busy"" to a degree that the viewer is placed in the paradoxical position of having nothing to look at.  Viewers are denied the ""freedom to see"" on their ever larger, higher definition screens.  Everything of importance to the sponsors and filmmakers is magnified or grossly overstated, then thrown in the spectator's face by the hyperactive videocam and ""shock"" editing. But this series, sponsored appropriately enough by American Movie Classics, is the most refreshing, ground-breaking television drama since ""All in the Family."" We should all hope that it represents a new beginning rather than an anomaly, unique and distinguished as it is.",1327622400,2,9479,5.245208195637805

And his world is fascinating to say the least. What a great show for those interested in the creative side of the advertising process, especially in the 1950s--which i daresay is the MOST fascinating decade in American history, more influential and telling of the American psyche than even the 60s. To watch the value shaping influence that advertising in the 50s had on us today--with some damned sexy people to boot--it a complete and utter delight!!! If you haven't jumped on board the Mad Men craze yet, you're most definitely missing out!!",1326240000,,688,4.694214876033058
3020292,4,B000YABIQ6,"I sat down to watch ONE episode of this much discussed series. I ended up watching the whole first season (not recommended). It is relentlessly compelling, it is slavish as to period detail (and I would know, I was about 6 at the time that this series is set in), it is very well made, atmospheric in extreme and so attentively constructed that I should have loved every minute of it.

For those who are familiar with the term ""film noir"" then this is TV noir, and noir it is. One can be pulled into the very complex lives of each character yet not care about them in the least, save perhaps the secretary Peggy and I guess Don Draper and his Grace-Kelly-lite wife. (Both are so well played that to call it acting is a disservice to their efforts, they ARE these people, it is quite astonishing).

Much as Miami Vice was once a standout production (sound, costume, location, intriguing protagonists, some unexpected ones like Edward James Olmos, who MADE that whole show even have credibility) I suspect Mad Men is a similar quantity for today's overwhelmed viewer. I came from the advertising community, though not circa 1960!, and I can vouch for the attitudes and manner of Draper and coworkers, but it takes their careers and intermeshes into their personal character to such an extent as to be problematic. One of Draper's finest observations, and I won't give away any of the narrative plotlines, is when he muses how the younger generation has no one to look up to, just ""us"" meaning Draper and his incredibly flawed business partners, clients and neighbors.

You want to care about them but it is darn near impossible. I did really take to the department store side line, Menckens, both father and daughter, but to say more is to give it away.

3020332,3,B000YABIQ6,"The debut season of this series is, plot-wise, certainly good enough to keep viewers wanting more.  And the actors are competent, though too often they are victims of an overwrought, parody-prone direction that skews the stolidness of their performanances.  For, truly, this cinematic offering is farcical and was meant to be.
The premiere episodes of Mad Men deal with the legacy of the Fifties, and the show's creators have pulled out all the stops in mocking and denigrating the decade.  That alone will make for low satire, but the entire effort is enervated by an obvious lack of knowledge and understanding of the era.  Even in the basest forms of farce, the achievement of the sardonic depends on reality as its foundation, and the failure to employ subtlety in the treatment can doom its effectiveness.  For instance, this series presents smoking as ubiquitous and feverish in a manner that it never was.  At a time in which the activity was accepted almost everywhere, people did it leisurely.  There was no need to puff like a freight train for a nicotine high in a non-forbidden zone.  Many people used matches instead of lighters, and they didn't light up indoors with one hand shielding against a non-existent wind.  This kind of exaggeration results not in satire, but in burlesque.
As for pacing, the first couple of episodes are hobbled by a seemingly desperate impulse to inject as much anti-Fifties propaganda as an audience could be expected to stomach.  White males are overtly chauvinistic, white females overtly compliant, and blacks of both sexes menial-working, overtly servile, covertly surly, resentful, unhappy people.  After these wearisome premises have been well, well established, then the series gets more deeply into plotting.
The show's lead, Dan Draper, is not the manipulative, mercenary, unscrupulous, cut-throat character one might expect from the title.  Despite a sexist viewpoint, he treats women well.  He doesn't demean or prey on co-workers, and his on-the-side sex is with self-competent women.  He is affectionate and passionate with his wife.
Yet the creators' compulsion to spoof the Fifties/Sixties demands that they present Mrs. Draper as a neurotic, self-centered suburban housewife who worries about pretty divorcees and would rather see her daughter dead that facially scarred.  She lets her children put plastic dry-cleaning covers over their heads and romp unbelted in her vehicle.  As she putters about in her pumps and crinolined dresses, she presents an over-the-top image of a demented Fifties homemaker who, she earnestly tells Draper, thinks of nothing else but having sex with him.  Indeed, she does have a handsome, attentive, hardworking husband who many women would covet, yet she fantacizes about coupling with a milktoasty salesman/stranger and--somehow--orgasms against a running washing machine.  But, then again, the series' only all-together women are promiscuous.  Even single career women with one lover are portrayed as naive, frustrated, or unhealthily guilt-ridden.  Pre-sexual-revolution females, the series all but shouts, were mostly miserable creatures who often died in childbirth or succumbed young to dreadful diseases.  Christianity crippled them emotionally and intellectually and, in at least one case, created a wicked stepmother.  By the time 1960 rolled around, they were dizzily wearing mismatched clothing, draping living room furniture, and voting for Richard Nixon.
The problem with the program as lampoon is that it also strives to be a serious, ongoing serial that maintains interest and sympathy in Dan Draper.  It doesn't aid the drama to stick him in the same style of Production-Code pajamas that are also donned by his squirrely co-worker/rival or to subject the character and audience alike to  boring, protracted scenes like a beatnik debauch wherein everyone simply gets stoned.
The best aspect of the series is the business intrigue that has little or nothing to do with the show's sex, which is often as hurried and unpassionate as a toilet-stall encounter between strangers.  Scenes that do denote true affection are, of course, subject to the usual modern-day dread of deep kissing between actors and thus come off as chaste and staid.
The cause of the latter matter is something that really did begin in the Sixties.",1321315200,,4324,5.31424375917768
3020333,5,B000YABIQ6,"For me, the first couple of episodes were actually hard to stomach, given how abysmally the women characters are treated by the men in their lives, both at home and at work.

3020377,3,B000YABIQ6,"I heard a lot of great things about this show, and I figured I would watch it, to give it a chance. But unfortunately, the show seems a slow primetime soap opera aimed at mostly women; strange given the setting and content therein.  This fact disappointed me quite a bit.

Sure the production and acting is top-notch. But this is easy to do if you throw money around. The problem here is that the usual soap-opera staples are all here on display; the homewrecker that you luv to hate, the unattractive frumpy good girl that you should root for, the bad-boy lead, the nerdy loser who's only good for an one-nighter, etc.

The reason that I've never been fond of soaps is because I find them plodding, roundabout, and generally tacky stuff. But most important, they seem to emphasize the worst in humanity. The men are pretty boy meatheads or losers with crappy self-worth and hearts of gold (but are horrible lovers), the females almost always uniformly unpleasant people and nothing ever happpens in these shows; nothing ever gets done. I must come out here and say, I fancy myself a bit of a fiction writer and I hate these stupid tropes that tv writers lean on...but it makes bucks.

And I'm a guy that tries to give these chick-flick soaps a chance. But they never keep me around long, sadly. I'm always run off. So many great pilots of interesting dramas get bait-switched into these backstabbing snobby harpy character vehicles that no wonder I gave up on television years ago.

I just don't like that lame tactic, in particular. Shows about simple plot, characterization and actual meaning and purpose becomes ""he slept with her and she got mad and tried to kill him, but then they made up and then ""A MISUNDERSTANDING"" happened, and now she hates him again and now she cheated on him with his nerdy friend and he clammed up and couldn't satisfy her, so she went back to Bad Boy and batted her eyelashes because ""I'M THAT HOT"" and ""MEN ARE EASY"" and of course he took her back, but he was SO MAD cause he's BADBOY and he slapped her HARD in the face, and now she's gonna sue him to MAKE HIM PAY, but the lawyer is cute, so I gonna seduce the lawyer now, and get revenge (plus he's loaded!!) against BADBOY, but he finds out and Lawyer and BadBoy fistfight each other over my honor and...well, the point has been made.

Yeesh. After a while, it's all 'bla-bla-blah'.  I just don't get it.  But it's very well produced, so you gotta give it points for that, at least.  Sigh.",1317168000,,2478,4.513392857142857

Not only is that one of the weaker episodes of the second season (in my opinion) but attempting to jump on board with this series without having viewed any of the first is nearly impossible.  The characters created by Matthew Weiner and his creative team are remarkably layered and difficult to read and it is essential to start at the beginning in order to be able to more fully understand who these people are and what makes them tick.  So I recently went back to the very beginning and I was pleasantly surprised at just how engrossing, intelligent and shockingly moving it all turned out to be.  But you have to be patient.  Mad Men peels away the layers of its characters slowly and with precision never forcing the action along or making the characters do anything that feels unbeievable or forced.  The result is an admittedly slow pace, but after time it becomes almost hypnotic and the payoffs are huge.

On the surface, Mad Men appears to be a highly stylized re-creation of the early 60's advertising business right down to the tiniest details.  But in reality, the show is all about what lies beneath that sleek surface and in Mad Men's case, that's a lot.  While the employees of the Sterling Cooper ad agency go about their daily routines (which include driniking and smoking in the workplace, treating the women in the office like objects and casually engaging in extramarital affairs), the entire cultural/social/poltical landscape is rapidly shifting.  The men and women of Mad Men are still clinging to the values and social conventions that were in place before the 60's tore the nation apart and redefined the roles of women and minorities and laid the groundwork for an entirely new national psyche.

But Mad Men is also about the emotions, desires, wounds and other messy issues that the characters fight so desperately to avoid.  I think it's fair to say that part of the shows glacier pacing is a direct result of the strain on nearly every character to avoid dealing with things.  So a lot of time is spent watching the Mad Men and their wives/mistresses focus entirely on their work and the day to day routines that barely hold back the flood of emotions threatening to break free. It's a very accurate depiction of how people live their lives even today.  In the end, that is why Mad Men feels thouroughly contemporary and resonant.",1317081600,,2577,4.693333333333333
3020379,5,B000YABIQ6,"Why, oh why did it take me so long to start watching this show?! I love everything about it! ""Mad Men"" takes place in 1960 and follows the lives of the men (and women) who work for an ad agency on Madison Avenue in New York City. There is nothing bad about this show. My favorite thing about it is the overall look of the show. It's so beautiful, the costumes are gorgeous, everyone smoked and drank 24/7 because it was socially acceptable back then...what's now to like?!

The main character, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is a conflicted man. He has issues at work, issues at home, and a mysterious past that slowly begins to unravel as the season progresses. Don is married to Betty (January Jones), a picture-perfect housewife who is blonde and cute as a button, but I HATE HER!!! She is such a terrible person and I do not blame Don at all for all his philandering. There's an outstanding cast of supporting characters as well. I think Roger (John Slattery) and Joan (Christina Hendricks) are my favorites. Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) is super annoying and I hate her almost as much as I hate Betty (but not quite).

I love that, because this is an AMC show and not an HBO show, there are a few curses uttered here and there, but no violence, no nudity, and no use of profanity every third or fourth word. Everything is elegantly implied, which is so great, especially for a show set in this era. I am so glad it's on AMC.

Its also unfortunate that someone would give an episode a one star, as an opportunity to whine about a technical problem as opposed to writing about the episode...anyway...This episode is great; probably one of my all time favs. Probably because it has great examples of all the things fans enjoy about the show: historical context via an important event like the approaching 1960 presidential election between JFK and Nixon, the ultimate ad man's con, as he ruthlessly pursues Don, the men in the office at the height of their arrogance, self-entitlitled, sexist and sexually harassing worst... And then there is Betty...This may be one of her greatest episodes...possibly the first where we begin to see the complexity of her character, her family history, its effects on her parenting, and the toll of being a suburban housewife.

The story is gripping, with surprising depth. ""Who is this Don Draper guy and why does he do what he does?"" is the question that keeps you watching. The pitch about the Kodak slide carousel was incredible, for example. And it's fascinating to see a glimpse of that long-gone world of 1960. I really don't understand the reviewers here who found the show boring.

There is, however, way too much sex for my taste. Way way too much. Were people really that immoral back then? I don't know but I don't want to see it so explicitly.",1309305600,2,672,4.419354838709677

3020432,4,B000YABIQ6,"Cro-Magnon sensibilities and habits combined with modern self-doubt and self-destruction yields a potent and intriguing television drama. There is great joy in celebrating the era which is shown in the wonderful attention to detail. This attention also is shown in the way Mad Men delves into the effects of that era on the American psyche. If you grew up in that era you will be constantly be entertained by the period detail and the take on the rise of the American corporate beast. This is the Industrial Military Complex defined. If you are younger and seeing it for the first time you should not discount the hedonism, greed and avarice that permeates every episode. They were and still are the defining characteristics of the post WW II American evolution. It's also what built the powerful economy that now is in tatters. The same types of men doing the same types of jobs you see in Mad Men now worry about how fast they can get out of the American market. They only want to tap into the international economy that is swiftly passing us by in order to continue the ritual. This series is highly recommended to fans of ennui and the smoking of many cigarettes. Hey, that sounds almost...French.",1303257600,,1201,4.723809523809524
3020433,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is one great series. The ensemble cast is really outstanding. Jon Hamm as Donald Draper is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen. At once dispicable and flawed, and at the same time noble and redeemable, he is by turns maddeningly clueless about relationships and incredibly astute about the ad biz. Elizabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen portrays a young woman who sees the possibilities for women in general and herself in particular at the beginning of the women's movement of the 60's. The sets and costuming are well researched and the whole feel is very true to the era. The fact that the writers include major events ( Cuban missle crisis, JFK death) of the time and their effects on the characters is also a good feature.
I highly recommend this whole series.",1302566400,,777,4.678832116788321

To me being 50 years old, i always thought the 60's was a much less complicated time, more family oriented, simpler and people generally had better morals. If this show is any indication as to how it really was, then perhaps nothing ever really changes. The
only thing that really pisses me off about that time was the dismissive way men treated women, and perhaps they still do but the

I had heard all the hype it was getting as well as the multiple awards it had won. In my opinion the show is really not as great as everyone says. Sure, the acting is good but you can get that with every other great show on TV that gets nowhere near the hype Mad Men does. I'm a fan of shows like Breaking Bad, LOST, 24, Dexter, and formely The Sopranos even though the last few seasons were not as great as it once was. With Mad Men I see most of the charcacters as very arrogant and unlikeable. It really is not addicting as everyone says. There isn't anything exciting about it. It has nowhere near the quality of a show like Breaking Bad. If you missed the boring slowness of the last few seasons of The Sopranos than watch Mad Men. Even The Sopranos never got as much praise as Mad Men. I'm writting this review under a different name because I fear that I will be assisinated by the liberals at the telivison academy for condeming a show thats so higly praised by everyone when realistically it is just an overhyped period drama that is most likely not historically accurate.

Honestly, I began watching Mad Men because I was sick of it winning all the awards that I wanted ""LOST"" to win.  I just had to see what the buzz was about.

I started Season One less than a month ago, and have all ready watched through the end of Season Four.

In my experience, in order for a TV show to work, it has to make you care about it's characters. The creators of Mad Men have done this with impeccable finesse. The characters in the show are almost excruciatingly human. They are jaded and flawed in such away that anyone can relate to them.  The writers took time to show some of the key characters' back stories, which helps explain what makes them tick.

You will find yourself entranced by the seduction of these characters, even if you don't agree with many of the things that they do.  They make mistakes... they fail... sometimes they succeed. And you will be pulling for them all the way.

The quality of Mad Men does not belong on Television.  Every episode is like watching a very well put together movie that took years to perfect. From the script, to the music, to the cinematography.

The historical setting (Madison Avenue circa 1960) is great for showing us how times have changed during the past two generations, every character is developed and portrayed in a way that I can believe and empathize with, and countless facets of the human condition are explored with remarkable depth and nuance, so I'll assert that this series deserves to be classed with the world's great stage productions and literature (dare we mention the name of Shakespeare?).

You really have to talk to an ad person from the 60's to appreciate how well the directors captured the essence of what it was like to work on a Madison Avenue ad agency in those days.

3020619,4,B000YABIQ6,"So been shopping around for a new series since The office has jumped the shark. this dude on facebook kept writing recaps the new season of Mad men on his updates. So I decided to check it out,start from the beginning.
It is a soap opera ,but a good one. Unlike a soap opera the writing is not empty and the characters are more than cardboard cutouts. Like Don who wants to love his wife and family, but doesn't know how, because he doesn't grasp what love truly is .
And roger the big mouth who is digging his own coffin and partying constantly because he has nothing else left. And betty an accomplished woman who resents being a housewife and makes everyone around her suffer for it.
You can see this desperation in everybodies eyes like they can't stand being stuck in these dumb molds society put them in one more minute.
I love looking at the clothes. The colors are so bright, they hit you in the face. Because I didn't live in this era and the few pictures I have of my grandparents and family during this time are in black and white. So you can't see the vibrant colors. Like what color ball gown so and so was wearing.
It really bothers me some of the things people say to each other. Even though I know people talk like this, then and now.
 Like Roger telling a female friend who is his right arm that she is the finest piece of ass he's has ever had, or how one character tells peggy who is slightly chubby , and she should  enjoy the crude comments made by execs while they last, cuz she isn't much to look at.
The only quibble I have is the dvd doesn't come with many perks. Like their is no way you go back and look at scenes. And they don't tell you what the episodes are about.",1284595200,,1694,4.193251533742331

One has to witness the perfection in his performance for themselves to really understand Don Draper and Jon Hamm's talent.

3020622,5,B000YABIQ6,"I never watched this program before I got this set on DVD. I have to say that I am very pleased with it, although this isn't the kind of show I normally like. The opening scene of the first episode really served to hook me.

The program is set in the early 1960s in Sterling Cooper, an advertising agency on Madison Avenue. The lead character is Don Draper, an executive and idea man who works at the agency. He has issues, as we find out further and further along in the series. Indeed, is he even who he says he is?

3020624,2,B000YABIQ6,"Upon hearing all the hype about their new (4th) season and all the awards, I checked out Season One at the library to try and follow it from the beginning.

As there is a dearth of good drama on tv, I wanted to become a fan, but each episode left me with an empty, dissatisfied feeling, which I blame on the writing.

Many of the sub-plots are simply preposterous, e.g., the lead character stealing the identity of his dead G.I. colleague - right, like he's going to come back to his platoon suddenly claiming to be the other guy (and that he himself died), and no one will be the wiser.  Absurd!

Most all of the major characters are non-sympathetic, so that you're not rooting for anyone, they're all bad (or vapid) people.  The Pete Campbell character I can hardly stand to look at.  Only a few peripheral characters seem to be relatively decent.

I realize normal people don't make complelling television, but it's a too cynical view of the business world; you've got to have some balance.  Some of the scenes are just too over the top: morally revolting (Roger Sterling and his ingnue playthings) and even cruel (Don Draper's treatment of his sympathetic half-brother).

3020666,3,B000YABIQ6,"Kevin McDonald's 'The Culture of Critique: an Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements' (1998, 2002) describes how ""Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual movements during the 20th century."" McDonald argues that ""these movements are an attempt to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. Several of these Jewish movements (e.g., the shift in immigration policy favoring non-European peoples) have attempted to weaken the power of their perceived competitors--the European peoples who early in the 20 century had assumed a dominant position not only in their traditional homelands in Europe, but also in the United States, Canada, and Australia...Ultimately, the movements are viewed as an expression of a group evolutionary strategy by Jews in their competition for social, political, and cultural dominance with non-Jews.""

AMC's 'Mad Men' Season One (2007) and its subsequent seasons are of such exceptional quality that the program practically sets a new standard for television excellence--a very surprising thing to find on American television, whether network or cable, in 2010.

Creator, writer, and director Matthew Weiner's 'Mad Men' is about many things, but it is primarily about the end of an era in American history, an era seen by many as one of America's 'Golden Ages,' and one which was culturally, socially, and financially dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants--WASPs.

WASPs dominate 'Mad Men,' and while the program is superficially sympathetic to its WASP characters some of the time, the viewer can't help notice how married advertising executive Don Draper's Jewish mistress, department store owner Rachel Menken, eventually makes the 'right' choice of rejecting Draper and wedding a respectable Jewish man. Elsewhere in the show, the Jewish men and women that infrequently flit across the screen (potential clients representing the State of Israel's tourism bureau, etc.) are depicted in  largely agreeable, if stoic, terms.

Beneath its always intelligent, amber-hued surface, 'Man Men' is certainly a hard, even an ugly, critique of High WASP culture: though the Drapers and most of the other characters are educated, socially prominent, poised, witty, attractive, and talented, they are also routinely adulterous, alcoholic, and believe women are capable of being little more than sex objects, housewives, or over-the-hill matrons worth deceiving until divorcing.

The show's subtitle, in fact, could accurately be ""Oh, Those AWFUL White People.""

One account executive is so drunk in the midday office that when he urinates in his trousers, the accident has to be pointed out to him by coworkers. Another character allows his eight year-old granddaughter to drive an automobile through the Hudson River Valley's suburban streets. Ad agency partner Roger Sterling enthusiastically performs Stephen Foster songs in blackface at his palatial Long Island estate, sexually propositions Don's wife the moment Don steps out of the room, and unquestioningly assumes that the models used in agency campaigns will have sexual intercourse with him.

A handsome young doctor rapes his newlywed wife on the floor of her office; one presumably loopy secretary runs over and amputates her boss's foot with a riding mower at an office party.

The ad executives smoke marijuana and consort with drug dealers, have their secretaries sit on their laps while doing their typing, and steal mail not addressed to them. Account Executive Peter Campbell attempts to blackmail Draper to force a promotion. A comedian, who has everything to lose and nothing to gain in his action, insults the overweight wife of his sponsor. The Sterling Cooper staff believe Nixon is a natural to win the presidency over Kennedy.

During a casual business meeting, two of the male staff mock the 'awful aprons' worn by the WASP star of 'The Loretta Young Show Show,' and even the fabric pattern on the same program's sofa, but Jewish Bob Dylan is praised during the same discussion.

When Don's beautiful wife, Betty, pushes her adulterous spouse in an explosion of frustration, Don shoves her back with at least equal force. When the Draper family enjoys a picnic on a pristine Hudson River Valley hillside, they blithely leave a small mountain of garbage behind them; Don casually throws his beer bottles in the bushes.

Don fires his male art director for refusing the sexual advances of an important client, also male. When Don discovers one of his mistresses has been discussing him with her friends, he forces her arms behind her, ties her to the bed--and leaves her there. Don rejects his younger sibling, Adam, so completely that Adam hangs himself in despair.

And most tellingly, handsome, dapper, capable Don Draper is not the educated gentleman of the upper class he pretends to be; he's the illegitimate son of a prostitute who died in childbirth, and who was then abusively raised by 'backward' Pennsylvania farmers.

Don is an unconscious misogynist, a compulsive liar, a philanderer, a drunken driver, a sociopath, and a complete fake in almost every sense. His true background is in used cars and furs. Don is false. Though typically presented in the show's deceptively glamorous light, Don is one of Elliot's 'Hollow Men,' empty and stuffed with figurative, existential straw.

All of these incidents and characterizations might be expected and wholly acceptable if 'Mad Men' was a typical American soap opera, whether a tradtional daytime melodrama like 'As the World Turns' or a slice of 1980s primetime kitsch like 'Dynasty.'

But 'Mad Men' is not a soap opera; 'Mad Men' is a 'serious' drama aspiring to be 'serious' 'art' of a kind (though 'The Jet Set' episode in Season Two, in which Don is taken up by an international set of wealthy vagabonds in California, probably the worst-written of any episode in the first four seasons, veers hilariously towards outright soap opera camp).

Much of program is rooted in 'hard' fact (Don Draper is based around legendary ad man Draper Daniels, for example), and appears to accurately reflect history; however, it is WASPs, and by extension, all Europeans of Anglo-Saxon descent who come in for Weiner's and his fellow writers' continuous spleen (copy writer Peggy Olson, for instance, is Catholic and from a lower middle class Brooklyn background). Black and Hispanic characters are few and relegated far to the sidelines.

Though the show is thought-provoking, entertaining, and often brilliantly written and produced, the excessive critique of Western European-American culture is unfair to its subject, insofar as Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics are almost completely exempted from the same criticism. When Jewish, Black or Hispanic characters do appear, they are presented as either victims of WASP culture or shrewd individuals who use their intelligence to avoid both victimization and personal moral and ethical failing.

Viewers will be hard-pressed to imagine a program with a similar show of teeth being made by Protestants about Jews; the outcry against it would be tremendous, and cries of anti-Semitism would flood the media landscape.

'Mad Men' is simply another in a series of 'blows against the empire' WASP America has suffered since the 1960s. It succeeds in its own way because, thanks to the forces aggressively united against WASP America for four decades, many of which are now a dominant presence the media, today almost everyone is quite familiar with the narrative 'Mad Men' is selling: ""We all know that that is how White people are, and certainly were then.""

Watch and enjoy 'Mad Men'; but by all means watch it critically, as it deserves to be watched, and do not overlook what the show fairly celebrates: the Fall of the American Anglo, which the opening credits dramatize quite literally.",1282176000,9,8011,5.30205047318612
3020667,5,B000YABIQ6,"I'll just chime in with what everyone else is saying: this is great television.

The writing is astounding. The acting is excellent. There is little of the overacting and cliches that plague most modern television. The ""Kodak carousel"" scene is one of the great scenes in all of television.

Unfortunately, the series dropped off sharply after the first season and started to accrete cliches, although it still had moments of wonder.

The blu-ray looks very good and I strongly advise it over the DVD. The textures from the 1960s are interesting to see, for one thing, and the characters, because they do not overact, require close scrutiny.",1281916800,,641,4.97196261682243
3020668,5,B000YABIQ6,"When this series first started up, I thought it was one I would skip. After it had been running a while, I heard it was very good, so tried out an episode from season one and got interested.

I've now seen all of season one and REALLY liked it.

As I told a friend of mine when recommending it. This tells the story of the era where we come from. I was born in 1960 which is the year of season one.

Shall we say times have a changed a LOT since then. It is hard to imagine that things were as depicted, but they probably were - well, I suspect they exaggerate maybe a tad, but maybe not. Politically correct it is not.

One thing is all the smoking. I mean, it is constant. And the drinking. And ""bad"" behavior.

People think we live in a more enlightened time now and maybe we do, but still watching this show, I cannot help but feel that we lost something we need to find again in the process.

If you can't remember the early 1960's, take a look. It does seem to be true to life setting wise. They did an incredible job there.

Briefly, the show centers around a guy working in an ad agency in New York starting in 1960. He has a mysterious past which is explained late in the first season. He is a likable guy, but he has some big flaws - at least as we see things now anyway. We meet his wife and family in the series and people he works with as well as many colorful clients.

3020673,5,B000YABIQ6,"Sometimes a TV series or movie comes along which hits on all eight cylinders.  Mad Men is one of them.  I'm a bit young to remember the time period of Mad Men's first season (1960), but the tone of the times feels right.

Casting is wonderful.  Jon Hamm as Don Draper is a real find.  This guy is perfect in the role, Brylcreem and all.  He is a ad genius, a madly successful ad man who thinks on his feet, has brilliant insights, a beautiful loving wife (the unbelievably attractive January Jones), and two smart kids.  He has it all, but wants more.  He beds a series of women, because he likes them and likes the sex.  He just assumes his wife will be oblivious to that; and in those times maybe that happened more often than not.

There are films or series that are mainly set in the workplace, but most don't focus on the day-to-day interactions, at that workplace.  We don't learn how to behave or interact in those series.  Obviously, there are some notable ones, but most of even those (The Office, NYPD Blue, House, The Wire) feature people we just don't know that well (cops, doctors, comedy writers, (and in the case of the Office, complete goofs)).  Mad Men, we can identify with, because we all consider ourselves somewhat of experts on advertising, since we see lots and lots of it, every day.

Very Highly Recommended. An excellent show in all regards.  Five plus stars for Mad Men.  They have a winner here.  Can you believe that HBO passed on this one?

Let me add a bit on the DVD extras.  There are a lot of them, and insightful.  We learn, for example, that the first show (the pilot) was filmed in New York before moving to LA.  The sets feature ceilings, because the director wanted to show the period suspended ceilings (most productions have no ceilings because that's where the lights and other equipment hang).",1277510400,,1836,4.503030303030303

3020675,3,B000YABIQ6,"I will keep this short since so many other people have made excellent comments on this series, and thus I would only be repeating their words.

We never saw MAD MEN on TV, we only just now rented the first season on DVD.

Oddly it was one of those new shows we saw advertised once years ago, but then never heard or saw anything more about it.  We never even came across it by accident turning channels over the past 3 years.

But the people working on this show deserve great praise for bringing the early 1960s alive !!

Sometimes you forget you are watching a recreation of the 60s and feel like you are really watching something from that era.

Much of the show's initial charm rests in it's nostalgic recreation of the culture of the era ........ we can also get a chuckle by seeing products featured on the show we remember from our younger days.

The only small critique I may make is the storylines sometime move at such a slow and agonizing pace it gets a little boring.

Despite the praise above, I must confess after 2 seasons, we have lost all interest in the show.

I suppose it cant' be helped being a time period drama, but it started to feels like nothing more than a daytime Soap Opera but set in the 60s.

Maybe the unique novelty of being so authentically set in the 60s made it feel special for 2 Seasons ....... but now it just plods along like an episode of ""As The World Turns"".

3020718,5,B000YABIQ6,"FABULOUS, FABULOUS!  Better than Sopranos, which is better than anything else on TV.
  Obviously I wholeheartedly agree with most previous reviews. I just want to add my two cents to highlight some areas that I think reviewers didn't quite do justice to:
1. Don's Wife:  Betty Draper is often stereotyped by reviewers as being a gorgeous ""childlike"" Stepford wife type.  I disagree. There is much more to her than meets the superficial eye.  She is a woman with beautifully portrayed ambivalence--she revels in, and dazzles us, in her in her breezy handling of her assigned role as gorgeous, loving, devoted wife and mother, and housewife.  But, inside, there is depression, loneliness, alienation, and even anger and a sense of entrapment.  Indeed, her lines reveal this at almost every turn.  On the one hand, she is clearly an opinion leader among her neighborhood girlfriends, (e.g. in her persuading her friends to show some tolerance and sympathy for the divorcee who just joined the neighborhood), and she is a complete equal in her intelligent repartees with Don.  On the other hand, she is a nervous hostess, full of anxiety to put on the perfect birthday party for her little girl, and she is afflicted with some scary psychosomatic numbness and shaking in her hands, which lead her to the 1960s shrink's couch.  Her relationship with Don is a beautifully scripted and choreographed blend of real love, with a partnership of openness and honesty with regard to all of their SHARED life, battling with deception, and clandestine played out escape fantasies in each of their private lives.
2. As many reviewers comment, Mad Men is a real gem of a presentation of an anti-PC, ""in your face"" 1960s world.  BUT, it doesn't simply flaunt and revel in the ""capitalist"", ""materialistic"", ""vice-ridden"" culture.
  Far from glorifying this lifestyle, it displays, indeed very much wants to capture the viewer's attention to, all the darkness, the traps, the alienation, the Darwinian competition, and the sickness, that this world creates!  Indeed, this very unapologetic flamboyant, and gorgeous, movie quality TV show, treats the viewer with a rare degree of respect--the viewer sees it as it really was, and judges without interference or propaganda, for him or her self.  What a rare treat!",1273276800,3,2294,5.077333333333334

The picture quality on the blu-ray is far superior to the DVD, though it does have a few quirks that are a product of the transfer. The sound is better as well, allowing the sound design to breathe more openly.

I did experience a bad copy of a first disc where the image froze for almost a minutes length on episode 3, but Amazon was good enough to replace it right away. No technical problems the second time around. One thing I appreciate about Amazon is they don't make you send the defective copy back before they send you a replacement.

3020723,5,B000YABIQ6,"Although I did not grow up as the child of a Madison Avenue type, I recognize this as the world of my childhood.  I guess that I was about the age of Don's daughter Sally back then.  Mad Men certainly captures the ambiance of that highly sexualized and politically incorrect era.  I find Don and his pals both troubling and sympathetic.  The men are certainly passionate about their work, but their interactions with their wives and girlfriends seem almost completely phoned in.  When Don looses an client--he is shattered--but loosing a girlfriend (or a terrible fight with his wife) hardly makes him blink.  Really, the only relationship between a man and a woman that seems significant to me is that between Pete Campbell and his  wife Trudy--even though he is fooling around with Peggy on the side.

I also find Don interesting as a sort of interface between the 60's Urban metropolis of his work world and his depression era rural roots.  One of my parents came from a rural community and home lit by only kerosine lanterns and devoid of indoor plumbing.  Much of my young life was spent trying to come to terms with the modern world as seen through the prism of my parents' rural and small town perspective.  Sadly for poor Don though, his childhood was an unpleasant one that left him without the emotional context necessary to find happiness in his personal life.",1268438400,,1371,4.718487394957983

The pace is fairly slow to begin with but sets the scene perfectly as the season draws to its climax. The main character is extremely complex, interesting and never fails to leave you astounded. No surprise he has won multiple awards for his performances (notably Golden Globes). The way women are portrayed is extremely unsettling for people born after this generation but I'm sure hits the mark.

The stories and characters are engaging and interesting; you might not always like them, but they're never boring. The sets and costumes are very authentic. It only took watching one episode to get me hooked. Everything about the show feels authentic, with the characters having attitudes and behavior one would expect in the early 1960s. Many of the characters are seen drinking in the office and smoking everywhere. At times they are also rather sexist and racist. That's not to say these issues don't exist today, but they were even more prevalent then. As a result, the characters aren't always likable. Despite their many flaws, each character is developed enough to give you something to like or feel empathetic toward.

The main character, Don Draper, is the creative director at the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency on Madison Ave. in New York City. He cheats on his wife, although he still seems to care for her and it's not quite clear why he cheats. Don is a very strong and talented person; besides infidelity, he has other flaws and a somewhat mysterious past. Betty is married to Don and they have 3 kids. She is not quite happy with her life as it is. While she is not weak by any means, Betty plays the obedient wife role to Don and raises the kids with the help of a maid. Peggy Olson (my favorite character) is Don's new secretary. Coming to the big city from a smaller town background is an adjustment for Peggy, who still dresses as a young woman might in school; Miss Holloway, the head secretary, tries to mold Peggy in her image. While Peggy is soft-spoken, she soon shows she has her own talents. Pete Campbell is a young account exec whose family is wealthy and well-known. He's engaged to be married but is attracted to Peggy too. He clashes with Don in his attempts to get ahead in the company. Also working at the agency are many other interesting characters, from the art director Sal Romano to the partners Roger Sterling and Bert Cooper.

The storylines are varied, with the ad agency setting providing interesting client interactions and the diverse characters' lives being anything but dull. With great writing and acting, every episode is different and lead one into the other with a continuing story. Thankfully, missing an episode isn't a problem when you have the show on blu-ray or DVD.",1265760000,,2440,4.6985981308411215

3020829,1,B000YABIQ6,"This time we go back to the early 1960's and the Kennedy years where Hollywood attempts to replace our memories of a much more innocent, moral and gentler American with a dark degraded and dysfunctional culture.  In this version all housewives are depressed and seeing shrinks, all husbands cheat, everybody drinks, smokes and slaps their kids around.  The critics like to call this show intelligent, they don't say why and I'm not sure either.  Maybe it's because of the liberal and gratuitous references to the holocaust and nazi's (which are completely out of place in a conference room in an advertising agency in the 1960's).  If you like shows that are  anti-christian you'll like this.  After all if you write the script you control the content, right?",1264032000,10,759,4.937007874015748

3020831,5,B000YABIQ6,"Ah the cigarettes, the sexism, the smarmy executives, the docile secretaries, the bored housewives ... welcome to America in 1960 and specifically Madison Ave where this engrossing series is set.

We are in the macho world of advertising execs on a quest to sell the perfect product while drinking and screwing their way to perdition. Much of the fun is seeing how much things have changed. Did people really smoke that much? I felt as if I was getting lung cancer just from watching them. They light up first thing in the morning, before meals, after meals, during sex, on the train, in the car, in the kitchen, in the toilet, in the office. The whole world musty have smelled of smoke. That lovely, blond, Grace Kelly look alike with the peaches and cream comlexion must have given off the odor of an ashtray.

Were people really so sexist? Women, or rather girls, are treated totally like objects -- of desire, or more accurately of lust, of ridicule, of disdain, of pity, of scorn -- never ever as equals.

The main character, Donald Draper, is a handsome, suave  and talented adman with a wife, two kids, a couple of mistresses and a secret. His secretary, Peggy Olson in an ingenue on the way up. Various other sleazy types inhabit the office. We also see Draper's home life, his lovely but bored wife Betty and the kids.

There's a lot of pleasure to be had from spotting the period references. The reconstruction of the early sixties milieu seems to be flawless. Wonderful artifacts of the period, half-forgotten, seem to pop up at every moment. But of course, we're not really in 1960 -- we're looking back at ourselves not so long ago and wondering at how far we've come -- and how far we still have to go.

This is a great series.",1263945600,6,1741,4.564102564102564
3020832,5,B000YABIQ6,"I cannot comment on the show. I think everyone before me has already stated how great and original the show is. It's a shame that HBO rejected this series. I bet someone's smacking his head right now.

However, I'd like to comment on the Blu-ray package itself.

The unsophisticated packaging is a double edged sword in my opinion. It gives us a cheaper product to buy in exchange for a great show. However, it's not something to gloat about in your collection. HBO series tend to have this hugely elaborate packaging that makes their shows stick out on your video rack. Yeah it's all fancy, but it just leads to a more expensive product taking up more space.

The packaging itself makes it look like a regular Blu-ray. Nothing fancy.

Other than that the menus are easy to use. A little bit too many warning sings for the paranoid MPAA, but other than that it's a great product.",1263686400,,879,4.544303797468355
3020833,4,B000YABIQ6,"I was hesitant to write a review--after all, there are already so many.  Yet, I found myself so thoroughly enjoying this show that I couldn't resist adding my 2 cents.

I had heard that the show took place in the 60's and was a fairly accurate account of life then--reflecting on business, the attitudes of men, the place of women, the homogenous business world.  None of which sounded like I would enjoy the show.  And yet, it came with such high praises that i was very compelled to  at least give it a try.

And I am glad I did.  Yes, it was a bigoted time.  Men treated women in a way that i find less than desirable.  Some women behaved in a way that diminished themselves just as much as the men diminished them.  But I found it almost comical--making it so glaringly obvious that the attitudes and behaviors were not the highest of human potential.  It actually reminds me of the way I feel about All in the Family--all in the family was a bigoted show that I think was really making fun of bigotry rather than promoting it.

The story also makes me reflect on my own life--how am i influenced by media?  how do i diminish myself?  But better than all of the reflection that I find myself doing--I enjoy the humor and great story line as well.

And also to specifically speak of the product and not just the series--I love that this has an auto play feature on the disc.  I know it sounds like  a minor thing--but i like the ability to just press auto play and it plays all the episodes on the disc rather than you having to go back to the main menu after each show and selecting the next one. The extras found on the DVD include interviews and commentaries, photos, and other things.  I didn't purchase this for the extras.  If i had to pick an extra that i enjoyed was the music.  Other than that, I prefer not to spend too much time on the extras.

I would have to agree with other reviewers and the media hype--that this is one of the best shows on tv.  although i do have others that i consider better--this is still up there as a must see.",1262995200,,2052,4.248062015503876

3020866,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is the best kept secret on TV.

This is a show that results in sensory overload. It is a look back to a time in our nation's history that is both melancholy and reprehensible at the same time.  It shows that the 50's and early 60's weren't as simple as those of us old enough tend to wax about. To the contrary it was a time when everyone smoked, men wore hats, women lived in corsets and girdles, and alcohol was consumed as if it was water.

Ye t it was also a time of change. A period when minorities were just beginning to be treated as ""real humans"" and women were trying to be viewed as equals.

It's amazing how quickly they are able to develop the characters and how quickly this show can get you hooked.

3020875,4,B000YABIQ6,"I have now re-watched Mad Men, Season One, a number of times and my opinion of it has improved, though I still find the lead characters, Don and Betty Draper, to be insufferable.  He's a cad, a liar, a jerk, an egomaniac, totally devoid of humor and not very bright into the bargain.  Betty is an empty-headed, selfish, childish, vindictive bitch, and she's not a very good mother, either.  The actress playing her should be booted from SAG.  She should at least be given elocution lessons and taught how to pronounce contracted words, like 'wouldn't', 'shouldn't' and 'didn't'  which, from her pouting little lips come out, 'wunt' 'shunt' and 'dint'.

Regardless, I am hooked on Mad Men!  Though it is still impossible to believe that Peggy Olson did not know she was pregnant until she gives birth!  Don's history is also a stretch but his secret hillbilly background lays the foundations for some depth in his story.

I have purchased the subsequent seasons (2 & 3) and await Season 4's release on dvd.  I don't have cable or satellite, not just for one show worth watching, so I have to wait with bated breath.  The series got much better after Season 1.

Mad Men is like an evil Dick Van Dyke show.  It's often very funny and the characters, beyond the Draper couple, are well-drawn and complex.  There is some fine acting by Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) and Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell).
And I love Joan Holloway played by Christina Hendricks.

Recommended, but the kids probably won't liked it.  It's adult drama and is full (too full) of Don's boring sexual exploits.
I hope they tone that down eventually, it's getting really boring, all that closely-miked lip-smacking and heavy breathing is too adolescent for a show of this quality.",1259020800,6,1751,4.806020066889632

Yes, I am consumed by the world, the writing, the look and the characters in ""Mad Men"" and I believe that creator Matthew Weiner's program will go down in television history as
one of the best ever.

One of the hallmarks of the show, is the articulate, clever and erudite dialogue spoken by the characters.

That is why it rankles and annoys me that the word ""amazing"" is used ad nauseum throughout the audio narrations.  It is spoken by Weiner, in such sentences as ""Look at this outfit. So amazing"". Or by a director, ""This actor, his performance is so amazing."" Or an actor, ""The writing is so amazing.""  Or when speaking about a cinematographer: ""His camera work is amazing.""  The paucity, degradation and vapidity of the English language, as it spoken in 2008 (when the DVD was produced) contrasts so vividly and poorly with the higher intelligence of speech that once came off the lips of English speaking men and women in the early 1960's.

But despite the ever odious presence of the word ""amazing"" there is quite enough in this DVD to satisfy the most crazed MAD MEN fan.",1257120000,,1324,4.632478632478633
3020921,5,B000YABIQ6,"If there's one thing I've learned by watching ""Mad Men"", it's that apparently NO ONE was happy in 1960. The men weren't happy and didn't know how to express it because they had to Be Men, and the women weren't happy because they were expected to be little more than mindless serving women. No one could talk about what they felt or what they really wanted, morality was subjective, and freedom was something you had only if you were a WASP, and even then it was the freedom to ONLY be a WASP and nothing else.

""Mad Men"", as you doubtless know, tells the story of a group of advertising executives at a New York ad firm in 1960. The men, and they're almost all men, are kings of their domain, but are starting to sense the early stirrings of a peasant uprising. It's this - the conflict around the upcoming rise in freedom and equality for gays, women and blacks - that forms the basis of a lot of the most interesting stories in this show.

The acting, directing and cinematography are all suberb. The plots are intelligent and well-written. You'll even pick up a thing or two about advertising!

I hadn't seen this program on TV, nor seen any episodes of it. I bought this DVD set purely on the strength of what I'd heard about it. I was not disapointed. It may not be the best TV show of the last ten years (""Battlestar Galactica"" wins that prize), but's supremely excellent and highly recommended!",1256428800,,1401,4.443579766536965

Since the very first minute I heard about Madmen, I knew I would be hypnotized by this program...NY, 1959, advertising business, women and men oh so elegant...

Not only this show is satisfying for the mind because of the looks, the atmosphere, but also the american society of the fifties, especially relations between men and women, is a character of its own right, if not THE main character of this show.

3021016,5,B000YABIQ6,I didn't start watching Mad Men until this summer. I started with the second season and found that it was pretty easy to put together some of the storylines. The first season is a must watch though and really has some of the best acting on television. Visually the show surpasses anything else. It's really a show HBO or Showtime worthy. Why both those big networks passed up on it is insane. AMC really hit a homerun getting this show. Creater and Executive Producer Matthew Weiner has taking some of the best directors and writers from when he was working on The Sopranos and if anybody has seen all seven seasons then you can see the similarities of Mad Men to The Sopranos. Don Draper IS the Tony Soprano of the 1960's just in advertising not organized crime. Season 3 has started up and has revealed some but this show seems to have so many layers its like an onion. The dvd box sets are worth watching over and over and thats why i bought both.,1252800000,3,950,4.403409090909091

I am glad Mad Men can remind people how far we've come in a very short time and I hope it makes us grateful for the struggles our parents' (or grandparents') generation went through in order for us today to live in work places that should be free of sexual harrassment and racial discrimination - to say nothing of cigarette smoke!

Beware, the pace of the acting is different from you regular network drama, so be very aware. But, that's what I love about it. I still laugh to myself when I remember some of the lines the characters say. The extras on the DVD are terrific.

It's filmed with cinematic sensibilities (the opening sequence borrows from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""). The actors are fascinating to look at: they seem to have been chosen based on what was considered movie style beauty fifty years ago. There is enough attention to detail to make merely WATCHING the background sets interesting (I found myself pausing at several points to appreciate the rooms, furniture, wall hangings, and prehistoric office equipment (watching this show is a good way to discover atomic age style and design). All this is interesting--to a point. But the scripts are nothing more than adult soap operas. Unhappy housewives, cheating husbands, men with dark pasts. None of this adds up to much more than what you can get from a daytime soap opera. The fact that more money (a lot more money) and research went into this doesn't redeem it from what it really and truly is: a soap opera. None of the character's tribulations add up to much in the end. And the writers wasted a golden opportunity to say something significant about the time period. Rather than exploit that, they simply threw the same trash into a different era. Watch a few episodes, monitor your boredom, and then move on to something more interesting when you get tired of seeing one more cigarette being put out in one more atomic age ashtray.

My best guess is this: since most series feature everyone overacting to the nth degree and ham-handed cues telling us when to laugh or be emotionally effected, critics have begun to equate boring characters, long silences, and meandering conversations with ""good acting"" and ""subtlety"". There's a difference, people. Every episode is like a game of ""guess what I'm thinking"". Characters say and do seemingly random things, often wildly out of character--but we don't get to know why, we can only watch as the camera zooms in on them contorting their faces, not saying anything because ""that's how it was back then"".

3021056,5,B000YABIQ6,"A surprising American series indeed. And yet it is fascinating. Nostalgia first. 1960 with the duel between Nixon and Kennedy. It is amazing to recapture these old pictures and these old events, and the reactions of some people to the events that were going to become historical if not frankly historic. Nostalgia too with the presence, excessive presence, total submersion if not flood of tobacco smoke in these episodes. I defy you to just feel like following them and chain, double chain, triple chain smoke the way they do. They kiss and smoke at the same time, smoking through their nostrils or their ears I guess. Was there a place where we could not smoke in those days? I don't even remember a non-smoking area, except maybe on trains, one compartment per carriage, when there were compartments. Smoke detectors were not trendy yet. Still  nostalgic but in another style and direction with the Korean war, but in a dramatic way: a lieutenant being killed and his identity assumed by the only witness, a simple soldier from nowhere who volunteered in the war to escape his own family he hated completely and utterly. The film is cruel about this episode, and yet the man is a success story on the basis of a college diploma he never passed, but who cares? No one of course. No deserting, no real criminal act, except the exchange of a dog tag with a dead officer. But then the nostalgia is quite tempered by the insight the other questions that are evoked here bring about some further evolution in society. The main and central problem is that of women. These women who were supposed to be beautiful to just find a husband through some work, at times, but not too much, then make two children, a boy and a girl if possible, and take care of the family home without letting any stranger cross the threshold. Those who worked real hard were not envisaging a housewife career but rather a plain career, be it social, economic, artistic or whatever. They were the new postwar generations of women who decided that the housewife fate was not for them, and anyway the economy required them to work and the incomes of workers and the new needs and consuming possibilities required a second income in the home. Here the film is quite clear about the motivations of women, of working women as well as of housewives. They want to have their say in things, their independence in life, the recognition of their personality and identity. The series is cruel though at times, but so true. Cruel with these housewives who are so bored that they waste their time on checking the phone calls of their husbands, and finding out about their affairs, the good old western Christian or Jewish polygamy. Cruel about the women who use their sex appeal or their yielding to the sexual appetite of the men around them just for their vanity and to have some small presents and advantages, like a canary in a cage. Cruel when a woman gets some authority over another woman and over-uses it, abuses it and even abuses the girl or woman she is supposed to take care of. But the worst cruelty is against all the macho phallocratic men who behave with women as if they were servants, subservient, as if they had to be crawling at their feet and obsequiously submissive. The men are odious, purely idiotic, blind but also conscious at times that something was evading and escaping them, that women, married or not, wives or not, Jewish or not, were taking over the territory that was becoming theirs, the family, their desk space, their waste paper basket, their box in the personnel lounge, etc. We just wonder if things were really like that and we have to remember that yes they were and yes they were changing in that direction. The last thing I would like to say on that series, I mean the first season of that series, is that there is a lot of humor nearly everywhere, and at times, quite often indeed, sad humor, but humor all the same like about the Jews who are still ghettoized, or a lesbian woman who is nicely diplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it. We are still in 1960 and Kennedy has not been elected yet and the real battle about civil rights is just starting in a way, for the Blacks. The Jews are maybe slightly different, but the gay and lesbian people are far from the beginning of the decision to just open the door of the closet one inch to see if there is anyone in there. I must admit it is good to look back, not in anger but in shame and in gratefulness, at times that have changed in this period that was just the very first step towards real freedom in our countries, and we are still far from the fulfillment of Roosevelt's promise about the four freedoms. By the way, what about the freedom from want in the healthcare field of poverty and misery, what about top notch surgery for a coronary accident of a homeless person?

3021057,3,B000YABIQ6,"I have heard people rave about this show and how smartly written it is, and how well it captures the atmosphere of the 1960s. It doesn't. It captures the LOOK of the '60s brilliantly, but otherwise, it's a caricature of that era. EVERY male character is a despicable, philandering, sexist pig who leads a pathetically empty life devoid of real meaning. Every suburban scene positively drips with the implication that these people all live utterly superficial, meaningless, shallow, phony lives, wearing polite smiles that they show each other, even as they connive and gossip maliciously behind each others' backs. And no one, but NO ONE is actually happy.  Every man and woman walks through life like a robot, doing what's expected and appropriate, and all secretly unhappy and unfulfilled.  There are no characters who really like their jobs, no husbands and fathers who truly love their wives and children, no wives who are genuinely happy to be raising their kids because they love them and love motherhood, etc.  What we seem to have here is an overreaction to the classic ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" view of life presented in the shows of this era.  If those shows over-sanitized life and presented a too idealized vision of American life, then I think this one goes too far in the other direction, and tries to make life back then look stylish and sharp on the surface, but totally rotten, corrupt, cheap, and ugly underneath.  The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between.

Take a look at how people behave on this show.  While I'm sure sexism and sexual harassment were a bit worse back then, it simply couldn't have been THIS bad. In one scene, in the first episode, one of the young executives looks a new girl up and down like a piece of meat, and then proceeds to offer gratuitous and explicit criticism of her her appearance and advice on how to sex herself up, right to her face. Come on! Sexual harassment was, as I said, probably worse back then, but this is outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.  The same character then asks this girls boss when he can have his turn with her, as though it simply goes without saying that she'll sleep with him; it's just a regular perk that goes along with the job, like having a key to the executive washroom.  Later on, another male character, who hasn't been so crude, spends a little time building rapport with this same girl, and she's glad to meet someone who appears genuinely nice and friendly.  And then the next thing you know, he gets her in an office, locks the door, and tries to start taking her clothes off.  Message loud and clear: he's just like all the rest.  Now really, was there ever a time when ALL men just took it for granted that every attractive woman was available and willing, and any woman who is nice to a guy will just roll onto her back for him at the first opportunity?  I don't think so.

And the writer's portrayal of racism, and classism is every bit as much a caricature as their portrayal of sexism.  This show is stylish, the dialogue is smartly written, the actors' performances are top notch, and the production values are superb.  The show recaptures the appearance of the early 1960s brilliantly.  But the treatment of how people lived and worked and acted is not nearly so well done.",1250899200,6,3382,4.647651006711409

The show is slow, horribly acted by stiff and uninteresting characters, and absolutely nothing of consequence happened during the entire first season.  I will not be wasting my time or money on any future seasons.

3021064,5,B000YABIQ6,"AMC's much-acclaimed Mad Men is a sterling example of how primetime television has evolved recently. While past television shows were dull visually and inert dramatically, particularly when compared to film, top-tier shows now display a sophistication that I would've thought impossible a decade back. While much has been made of the detail and authenticity (or lack thereof) of the early 60s setting, the specific locale (an Advertising Agency, Sterling Cooper, on Madison avenue) is equally intriguing. Though dramatic shows generally demand exciting professions (police, law or medical), the seemingly dull field of advertising is a brilliantly appropriate backdrop for an examination of the intricacies and drama of day to day life. As Mad Men repeatedly demonstrates, advertising is not about what is on the surface, but instead draws out that which was once inside, revealing that which no one, perhaps even the individual who is being exposed, was aware of.

Though Mad Men boasts an impressively large ensemble cast, the first season focuses primarily on a few central figures. At the heart of the show is creative department head Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the contradictory protagonist and already one of the most compelling characters on television. Though often amoral, Draper still embodies a masculine ideal: he is smart, cynical, ultra-competent and largely indifferent to social expectations. (Not to mention improbably handsome, but in a masculine, un-feminized way.) Draper is not without a core of vulnerability, but this only serves to give his strengths more weight. We also follow Draper's homelife, including his neurotic, vaguely unsatisfied wife Betty (January Jones) and their two young children. (Whom Don obviously loves, making his frequent neglect and betrayal all the more puzzling.) As a foil to Draper we have Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), a well-born and entitled junior executive who imagines himself heir to Draper's throne. Finally we have Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), a new secretary and eventual copy writer who is largely (though not entirely) separate from the cutthroat ethos of the office, and who often serves as an audience stand in. The cast of secondary characters (not that I've even covered all the major ones) is too large to really consider here, though the ensemble portrays them all with skill. The sheer size is perhaps a minor weakness initially, as it takes a long time for the average viewer to even remember who is who, and even longer for the characters to be developed. Nevertheless, it is worth the wait and effort.

The story is equally difficult to define, with the show taking an organic approach, juggling numerous different subplots without necessarily resolving them fully. The overarching threads could loosely be defined as the fate of Sterling Cooper generally (they're a small agency with, shall we say, erratic and unreliable leadership) and the uncovering of Don Draper's history. (He rarely talks about it, and with good reason . . .)  While the hedonistic lifestyle at the office is always substantial, I find the business angle particularly intriguing, with the show examining the underlying logic behind many real world ad campaigns. (These elements also give Draper a chance to cynically philosophize, which is always a treat.)

Though the intriguing storytelling soon takes hold, the new viewer will must likely first note the shows extraordinary visuals. While we don't typically think of eras that still hang on common memory as being fodder for period-piece detail, Mad Men recreates the dawn of the 60s with all the care that a high budget film would give to any pre-modern era. (Truthfully, I couldn't say if the visualization is utterly accurate, but the totality of the vision is certain.) Relatedly, Mad Men's depiction of older social mores has been the major source of both praise and controversy. Though a fairly socially conservative individual myself (outlandish tastes notwithstanding), I can't help but feel the more old-fashioned critics are missing something. Intentionally or not, Mad Men works as an antidote to the laughably superficial views of the era promoted by tedious productions like Sam Mendes' adaptation of ""Revolutionary Road."" Modern liberals like to pretend that social conservatism and conformity were the cause of all middle class misery prior to the 60s, but is anyone foolish enough to believe that Don or Pete or Betty would be totally content if they'd been after the blessed 60s? Though there are plenty of ""oh my god look at how terrible people were in 1960"" moments, Mad Men is ultimately just cynical, certain that there is only so much we can do to rein in human weakness. (Note how the beats and self righteous proto-hippies are portrayed in a less than glowing light, and are verbally eviscerated by Draper.) The validity of this perspective can be debated, but it's not quite the same as simple permissiveness. (I'd also say that the show's values are fundamentally bourgeois, though that's a debate too tiresome and lengthy to consider here.)

In the end, most great art or entertainment is defined by the nebulous core of humanity that is absent from mediocre works. Even though the characters often behave reprehensibly, an attachment gradually develops. This culminates in sorrowful season finale, where we see the initially overly vain and unsympathetic Betty breakdown in front of the weird neighbor child over the state of her marriage and life, desperately asking for this prepubescent boy to tell her everything will be okay. Even better is Don's nostalgia pitch for the carousel slide projector, where he illustrates the notion with a brief speech given over a series of photos from the happier times of his family's checkered past, and his always impassive face blanches and glazes over just so slightly with restrained emotion. Rationally, neither Don nor Betty is worthy of all that much sympathy, but here reason no longer applies. By the end of the first season, Mad Men has reached that magical point where the fictional figures mean more to the viewer than such non-existent figures have any right to. This is another rarity on TV, and an accomplishment that more than offsets whatever minor flaws the show may have.",1250380800,,6262,5.189910979228487
3021115,5,B000YABIQ6,"I still find it hard to beleive that HBO passed on this series, since they have had some of the best television shows in recent memory, incuding Oz, Entourage, Six Feet Under and of course the Sopranos.  I think I orginally heard of this because of that happening and decided to pick this up to see what HBO missed.

Mad Men is about the 1960s and you feel like you are there, with all the nuances of the times that are not here, rightly or wrongly, here today.  The drinking and smoking that was so prevalent of the times ( I vauguely recall similar things happening from when I was a child, though it was alot later than this series, but were still relatviely social norms at the time.)

It is all Father Knows Best pushed into reality, where the men were the bread winners and the woman stayed home or were relgated to less meaningful jobs.  The things that are often subject to the internet emails you get along the lines of ""How Did People Survive?""  (i.e., smoking, drinking, no seat bet type emails) permeates the entire show and there is the sense of how did people get by like that when we look at it today.  Not as an indictment, but more as that was then and not now.

Very well filmed and written.  Matthew Weiner's touch is still as strong as ever.

3021116,5,B000YABIQ6,"I recently watched clips of Mad Men on Hulu.  I found it very interesting and when Amazon had a sale, I bought Season 1.  I have now just finished a marathon session of watching Season 1, and this show blew me away!!  I only intended to watch a couple of episodes, but got so caught up in it, that I spent the entire day watching all 13 episodes.  I don't know how true the show is to Madison Avenue, but there is no political correctness here--the attitudes expressed on the show, while totally unacceptable today, all feel true and believable for the setting and time period.  It was shocking to see a pregnant woman drinking and smoking (because they did that then) and other things shown on the show.  I'm glad that most of those things are not done today, but know that people did act that way then.  The direction, sets, crisp dialogue, and depth of talent of the ensemble cast, most of whom I was unfamiliar with, are all incredible.  The only casting quibble I had was with the actor who portrayed the much younger ""little"" brother of Don Draper, who just looked and felt wrong to me.  He looked as old or older than Don.  The other supporting cast members, were great.

In those episodes you find disillusioned middle-aged executives of the early 1960s who feel the passaage of time, sense that the next generation is on their heels and who are hoping for an exit.  Add in some Serling-esque chain smoking, which is era appropriate of course.  It might just be convergent story evolution. I mean why write about happy middle aged executives in the early 60s, right?  But it could be that he's a Serling fan.

3021118,2,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is one of those historical TV shows which is fun to look at, but has almost no historical verity to it, sort of like Rome. It's not abysmally bad; sort of like Rome. You can watch it, and it's kind of fun for the soap operatics, and for what it reveals about the writers and people who watch it. It gets a lot of small physical details mostly right, which sort of magically transport you to the era of my parents photo albums. The ugly furnishings. The narrow lapel suits. Greasy haircuts. The dumb skinny ties. The fact that everyone chain smokes, and people drink at work and everywhere else, all the time. The glasses frames which make all the women look like nerds. That sort of detailed superficial appearances is what the entertainment industry has done right for the last 20 years or so; in fact, it's the only thing they've done right for the last 20 years or so. Of course, they're about 5 years off on some of the looks, but whatever; close enough. Another achievement, seemingly unique in the recent annals of television: some of the women actually look female. Of course, there are a bunch of hilarious anachronisms: beyond the non 1961 era suits and dresses ... everyone on this show sports an accent which didn't exist until around 1980 or so.

It has a lot of fun at the expense of advertising. I find this amusingly ironic, as most people who watch this sort of show work in similarly vapid ""creative"" endeavors involving selling underpants on the internet, or doing the same thing on an interpersonal level using some silly variety of psychotherapy or whatnot. It genuflects at the false god of the counterculture; making dumb nihilist beatniks out to be somehow in on a secret that the ad men can't fathom, when in reality, all they really have on him is an inferior drug stash; booze and smokes, after all, were the background relaxants of America's greatest years. Real beatniks made the imaginary misogyny of ""Mad Men"" seem like small beer. Think I'm making some kind of unfounded assertion here? Go find me a single mainstream work of literature as insanely misogynistic as Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" which treats women as animated cadavers. You can't do it, therefore I win.

One of the amusing things about this show is how wrong it gets morals and folkways. While I'm sure there was plenty of sexism and seducing of coworkers in the early 1960s (since there is plenty of both now), the idea that it was a time of utter crudity, casual race hatred, extreme classism and a male conspiracy to keep women down is transparently absurd. The people who were alive in those days are still alive. I'm related to some of them; life didn't work that way at all. People were pretty much the same as they are now, except instead of being sanctimonious about not being a racist or recycling or whatever meaningless moral absurdity they're able to come up with, they just had good manners, which actually works better. Classism was exactly the same then as it is now, and a lot more subtle than, ""I had to assume an officer's identity to make my way in the world."" By the way, the main character's class schtique is hilarious, because it's what every SWPL ding dong from the suburbs thinks about himself; that he escaped some horrible past and family trauma in the suburbs for the high privilege of living near ""artistic"" people. The idea that housewives led some kind of bizarro life of suburban alienation while their evil husbands were off sleeping with everyone is ... well, mathematically impossible. Think about it for a minute. Who are their husbands off rogering? If you believe the premise of this program, there are 4-5 women for every men. While such a world would be a nice place for me to live in, it doesn't have much to do with reality.

Still it's kind of fun to watch, in the same way Archie Bunker was fun to watch. As someone else put it, it's kind of like Halo night in a 21st century frat house. I'm not watching it for the cheap sanctimony; I'm watching it for the sleazy gropings, high office drama, the female looking women and drinking of enormous quantities of booze. Plus, everyone smokes; most TV has entirely not enough smoking. Bonus: it's a great exposition of 21st century American upper middle class neuroses about the past. The sanctimony about ""the way we really weren't so much,"" can be irritating if you let it, or you can laugh at it's idiocy and make drinking games every time someone acts in a way designed to elicit modern priggishness.

My rating: passionless suburban sex and a dry martini",1248912000,32,4553,4.624227441285537

3021120,4,B000YABIQ6,"I am late getting on the ""Mad Men"" bandwagon. After watching the entire first season (devouring it more is more like it) I can now see what all the fuss is about.

""Mad Men"" is a period piece; the period portrayed being the advertising world of New York in the early 19060's. Like any good period piece, the costumes, sets, tone, etc. are all faithful to the time period which it is supposed to be set (as far as I can tell). However, also like any good period piece, the characters, fleshed out and fully human, show that no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.

The characters in ""Mad Men"" are all playing the hands they've been dealt. It's entertaining to watch the men of agency Sterling-Cooper enjoying the privileges of being white, male, and professional at the time: at the office they smoke like chimneys, drink like fish, and are free to sexually harass the hell out of every female in the vicinity. However, the series quickly goes beneath that surface to show the complexity behind that seemingly chauvinistic situation. Many of the men, despite all their bravado, are mostly frightened babies, often buckling under the pressures of professional and family life. And many of the women, although seemingly submissive, expertly manipulate their situations to their advantage. Nothing is ever quite as it seems.

Even when it ventures into sensationalistic territory, ""Mad Men"" always maintains an air of dignity that keeps it from devolving into the sad state of many ""edgy"" cable shows, where the need to shock is constantly overpowering the need for believable character development. I'm hoping that the series continues to take the high road and continue to develop these fascinating characters for years to come.",1248393600,,1749,4.922033898305084

(And recommended by four out of five dentists)

There are definitely moments of real glory here, mainly from Hamm, who really brings home the bacon. He sells the sizzle and the steak as well. The rest of the cast is quite fine but he carries this puppy and does a very good job, showing far more depth than is common in tv acting.

Nonetheless, this show has Six Feet Under-itis: it comes out of the gate at a full gallop in the pilot and then slowly loses steam, until by the end of the first season it's still a fine show but has lost the magic of its early moments. It looks technicolor-lush and 50s/60s surreal throughout, though, to its great credit. Big props to the art designers on MadMen; it's as slick as its subject.

Matt Weiner writes some gorgeous lines (""He'd rather be a whiner than a weener?"" said the missus when he said his name on the commentary), and there are occasional moments of extreme lucidity regarding the America dream. For that alone this series deserves serious praise. That it slowly floats into soap opera-ish territory is unfortunate but mildly inevitable; series that start this strong and never fade are few indeed.

But those first few shows are tremendous, and this is in general many cuts above the norm; I'll take whatever knowing irony I can get these days, as the oblivious irony is endemic. Brutally honest revisionist history is a rare thing on American television and is always praiseworthy, especially when done with such loving care.",1248048000,4,1492,4.683206106870229

The show centers around an ad man, Don Draper, who struggles with his past and is actually a coward. He cheats and lies on his wife, rejects his own brother...yet you pull for him. The show also follows Don's new secretary, Peggy, who has an affair with an account exec, Pete. Pete is absolutely a rotten man who plays the perfect anti-Don.

The show is visually stunning and has that modern 60's feel which gives you the impression of Leave It To Beaver but the dialogue is anything but. One wonders how men got away with what they said/did but the women were just as bad. You will feel bonds with the characters and you will care about their fates.

Yes, see ""Desk Set"" or any other office based film to see how women were valued and the term ""WASP"" was really applied to hiring. Sure they jam a lot into 50+ minutes, but this was Madison Avenue and how the ""suburbs"" got stereotyped.

3021153,3,B000YABIQ6,"I think this show is very well produced and it's premise and setting is promising, but it's not a patch on the quality of a program like 'The Sopranos', from where it's creator Matt Weiner hails as a writer. I was initially disappointed in the 'stylized' performances in Mad Men as, in the wake of the Sopranos, I found the prospect of a realistically performed collection of early sixties characters very exciting. Unfortunately, despite the darker themes of the program, it is really a series of TV performances (ie the way we imagine 1960's characters to behave via our experience of their television). Thus there is no cursing, no genuine intimacy and a strange contrivance about all involved. It's a shame, especially when you can see a film like 'Revolutionary Road' pulling off just the sort of honesty and performance style that we might hope for from Mad Men. Other than that the program suffers from strangely judgmental moments, and others cloyingly obvious and Spielberg-esque. The Sopranos was never guilty of either of these crimes.

For judging, take the 'easy' criticism of the hippie characters that Draper visits (and dowses them with the predictable 'Get a job' criticism) - actually some of their criticisms of Draper were very interesting but they were marred by obvious, cliched portrayals of hippies. If Draper had've witnessed a Dylan concert in the Village or something nearing it's quality, he might have felt very inferior indeed. As it is, he has to sit through poetry so bad, only a cynical scriptwriter could've prepared it.

For cloying, witness the awful flashbacks to Draper's childhood, portrayed with such obvious message-mongering they border on condescension of the audience. Yes, we get it, Draper's dad was a 'bad man'. The most obvious shortfall of the program is it's inability to deliver us genuinely sympathetic and involving characters. The closest are Peggy and Draper's wife - but even they are basically shallow puppets caught up in the oh so important world of advertising. The show has two big things going for it; It's early 60's style is fresh and it has learned from The Sopranos that unpredictability is a compelling way to explore an ensemble cast. Other than that, time will get the better of this program.",1245974400,4,2261,4.994694960212201
3021154,3,B000YABIQ6,"After the 5th episode, I was beginning to think that I needed a drink.  Maybe if I was drunk I'd give this series 5 stars.  No wonder these people drank and smoked their brains out...their lives were so dull.  ""Madmen"" is not an exciting piece of work but a nice showcase of the 60s advertising industry and how it influenced and shaped American culture and consumerism. The script, art direction, and acting are intelligently well crafted and depict the facade of the era well. Unfortunately, most of the characters are still forgettable although the character development is obvious throughout. Plus, each episode drags and the delivery couldn't get any less climactic.  It took 10 episodes for me to finally get ""hooked"".  The story material is very dense and dry at times.  This series can't be easily watched in one sitting like others.  There are very subtle details that I think the average viewer would have a hard time noticing, let alone appreciating.  ""Madmen"" isn't for the average viewer of course.  For me, it was like watching a college sociology thesis put on film.  I found it fascinating and educational but mildly entertaining.  There's enough wit in the dialog that kept me interested.  Episode 9 is by far my favorite.  Worth a look to feed a itching curiosity of the 60s or for those who are looking for a show that is unique and insightful.",1245801600,4,1363,4.773504273504273

What I wasn't expecting from Mad Men was a meditation on existentialism and how close America flirted with nothingness while ""having it all"". Everyone in the series does what they think they should do, play the roles they think they should play with glee, all while being worried sick that underneath there is pain, unhappiness and baseness, and not much else.

 ""The universe is indifferent"", Don Draper says at one point, coalescing the characters' reaction to the void. Fill it up with instinctive desires and lust for dominance and power and get away with as much as you can. Meanwhile, they live with and romance complete strangers, and immerse themselves in their pre-cut roles while trying to avoid the unseen force that drives their behavior. When calamity strikes these souls, granite shells are exploded and inside there are often scared little children who are ill-equipped to deal with real life and real emotions that they are secretly victims of.

Mad Men shows people doing what's expected of them without bothering to do what they are supposed to do-on Madison Avenue, near the heights of success, as the opening of each episode shows, it's a long way down to the annihilation of everything they are, and a long time to think about it in descent.",1236988800,2,1387,4.815126050420168

Mad Men works on so many different levels because it combines both the traditional drama setting of work out and out work settings and conflicts with realistic and sympathetic people. Mad Men excels at showing the flaws at its protagonists while not making them out to be pure evil.  The Don Draper character is so well formed he seems ready to jump off the screen. Pete Campbell is the evil little weasel every show must have, yet he is also someone with a touch of humanity showing that while Mad Men is to a certain degree soapy it is not a classic soap opera.

3021404,3,B000YABIQ6,"In America there was a thing called the culture wars. The right said that up till the sixties things had been going well. The family unit was solid and because it was solid the nation was solid. The key to keeping the family together was strict sexual morality, the acceptance of woman as a home maker and the importance of raising children with strong values. If children had values they did not break the law, worked hard and society prospered.

Along came the sixties and women had conflicting roles. Morality fell apart and the divorce rate went through roof. Single familles were thrown into poverty and crime became rampant. The culture war was an attack on the changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century which saw the emancipation of woman, ending laws against homosexuality and the development of governmental roles to improve society.

This series appears to be a strong counter attack against the right suggesting a new model of what the fifties were like. It suggests that the developments in the sixties were against a society of the fifties seeped in racism, homophobia and misogyny.

Part of the appeal of the series seems to be a smug satisfaction by the viewer of how much things are better now and what repellent creeps are portrayed in the show. On a superficial level the characters smoke constantly, drink to excess and eat food drenched in dairy products. Anyone seeing the show now would realise that this sort of behaviour would lead to a life expectancy of about fifty. The male characters are white and who despise Jews. Any contact with women is predatory.

And of course there is some truth in the picture. If you want women to not have sexual contact prior to marriage and not to engage in affairs there must be strong social prohibitions in place. Whilst the fifties might have seen lower rates of pre-marital sex it was a period when terms such as ""slut"", ""mole"" and ""whore"" were not only in use but could be used to achieve social exclusion. A society which has ""strong morality"" is a society which is intolerant, judgemental and exclusive.

The major problem with the show is not so much the politics it espouses. Rather it is rather slow moving. One is not so much interested in the development of the story. Rather it is like watching a train wreck. It is a bit repellent but you feel compelled to watch it never the less.",1228348800,4,2376,4.6746411483253585

Everyone smokes almost all of the time in every scene, they enjoy five martini lunches, and doting wives wait at home for their husbands with a roast in the oven.

3021409,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is an absolute masterpiece. I agree 200% with all the rave reviews here.

I'm not going to add to the ample reviews of this show. Instead, I would like to comment on the generous extras included in the DVD set.

I debated a long time before buying the DVDs since I own the season on iTunes. I'm glad I bought the DVDs -- the commentaries and extras make it worth every penny.

Each episode has at least one commentary track, usually two separate commentary tracks. And there are other extras - a 20-minute piece, ""Advertising the American Dream"", a 10-minute video on scoring Mad Men, and the hour-long 'Establishing Mad Men'--all excellent.

A word about the commentaries -- the ones by creator and writer Matt Weiner are superb, very insightful and interesting. I haven't listened to all the other commentaries yet. Of the ones I have listened to, Weiner's are definitely the best, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones, and Jon Hamm also provide interesting depth. The brilliant costume designer Janie Bryant also provides wonderful commentary.

I wish some of the other commentaries had been edited, though. For instance, in Jon Hamm's, January Jones', and Elizabeth Moss' commentary on the last episode, 'The Wheel', Elizabeth Moss' comments on the padding used to show her weight gain. This is an interesting aside, but Moss' commentary goes on far too long and it's all trivial, with no insights into Peggy's character. She repeats the same stories again and again--for well over 10 minutes. Her commentary drones through an important part of the Draper story (Don looking at old photos of his brother). It's a shame that we miss Hamm's commentary during that emotionally moving portion of the episode.

But that's my only criticism, one small quibble. The DVD set is marvelous and if you're a Mad Men fan it will add substantially to your enjoyment and insight into the show.",1227830400,3,1887,4.918238993710692
3021450,3,B000YABIQ6,"I was really looking forward to this series after reading the rave reviews but I have to say I was disappointed by this tepid view of the heyday of advertising.  The series certainly scores high style marks but substance is woefully lacking in this rather narcissistic view of 1960 Madison Avenue.  Once past the good looks, crisp lines and jaunty banter, I found myself wondering ""where's the beef?""  The directors seem to revel in this decidedly man's world where women seem little more than muses, except for Peggy Olsen who finds herself quickly rising up the ladder with her honest view of products.

The firm of Sterling & Cooper comes across as a sexist bastion during a time when many women were breaking through such barriers.  You get the sense that Peggy is a younger version of Helen Gurley Brown who had worked herself up from the mailroom of the William Morris Agency to become one of the highest paid ad copywriters of the early 60s, eventually taking over Cosmopolitan and turning it into the magazine we know today.  Sexism was pervasive at the time, but this show seems to revel in it, with little sense of irony.

The episodes are painfully slow and Don Draper is painfully boring.  It takes 12 excrutiating episodes to find out about his hidden past, which in the end doesn't appear to make the slightest impact on the story as Cooper dismisses Peter Campbell's revelatory scene out of hand.  Seems Don Draper can do no wrong, although he appears to have an increasingly hard time at home as his lovely wife Betty comes apart at the seams like Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar.

After 12 episodes, I feel like I've had enough, although fans of this series keep telling me how things pick up in season two.  Maybe so, but the first season didn't do much for me.",1227830400,14,1776,4.606349206349206

4.  The story lines are intriguing, compelling, multi-layered.

There are some story lines that don't interest me: I get up and fold laundry or brush my teeth and floss anytime one of the kids are central to a scene.

What makes Mad Men so great is not just that the writing is incredible, the actors are great, the sets and costumes are so immaculate and colorful, the sense of time is so shocking and so believable. It's that this show transcends what normal television seems to hit--even the ""great"" shows are watchable once, maybe twice before they seem to lose their edge. I've watched several of these episodes three times or more, and the sense of art and space around the characters and their inner psychology is fascinating to watch.

These characters and these plots aren't just about something amazing happening; that's what makes them so special. These are normal, powerful men and women in ideal and slightly-less-than-ideal situations, and many of them have no idea why their lives are falling apart around them.

3021503,5,B000YABIQ6,"For once, I was onboard with a fascinating series right from the get-go.  On a syndicated PBS afternoon interview program called ""Fresh Air,"" someone associated with MAD MEN was the guest.  The host played some audio segments from one of the episodes.  This was radio, so I had only the words and ambient sound to go by.  The intelligence of the dialogue belied the nearly languid cadence of the speech.  This was something very different; very different indeed.

As it turned out, the dialogue I heard was from the very first scene of the very first episode, between Don and the black waiter, the discussion over the Old Gold cigarettes.  What a hook, in retrospect.  That scene sets the tone for all the episodes that follow.  It was a flash of brilliance that Matthew Weiner set his series in an advertising agency in the 1960s, a critical juncture in the social history.  Advertising concerns itself with appearances, associating a product with an image with no regard to its true value.  Meanwhile the characters are suffering beneath the appearance of propriety, with the knowledge that nothing is really as advertised.  There was the IMAGE of American life in stark contrast to the REALITY of American life, with its racism and sexism and everything else that was wrong.  The series is a complete theme with a distinctive visual style.  And that's why the Blu-ray edition is a must-own for any fan of the show.  Where I live, AMC isn't offered in HD, so seeing this series in this format, with all those 60s-era sets and styles, was like seeing it afresh.  It truly enhanced my appreciation, and gave me a good excuse to watch it all over again.

The features are replete with enough to keep you going back for more for a very long time.  Fans of the series will enjoy the revelations from the actors and creative forces via commentaries and documentaries.

3021506,5,B000YABIQ6,"After watching the first few episodes of ""Mad Men"", you can be forgiven if your eyes burn and you start to cough. It might be the only television show in history to cause second-hand smoke. Set in 1960, ""Men Mad"" is really about the 1950's and it captures the spiritual emptiness of the period perfectly. While the Eisenhower era has been romanticized recently as a wonderful time when all Americans had jobs, homes, and cars (and when Republicans were considered ""nice"" people believing in thrift) this fantasy is true only if you were a straight, white male. And a conforming one at that. Still, the emotion that pervades this series is sadness: no one is happy, no matter how many material goodies they have. Even the beatniks are gloomy and dull.

The men survive by chain-smoking, drinking themselves insensible and attempting to seduce anything in a skirt. The women are treated to such casual and pervasive sexism that, viewing ""Mad Men"", even conservative women like Phylliss Schlafly will send Gloria Steinem a fruit basket. The women themselves are either the original ""Desperate Housewives"" or trying to stay sane by manipulating the men who prey on them. People of color exist merely as waiters and elevator operators. In the world of 1960 advertising, they are completely non-existent. You see no ads depicting a black or Hispanic family buying a new car, sharing a beer with friends or ogling a new refrigerator. Nor will you for another decade.

Centering around the advertising executives of the fictional Sterling-Cooper agency (""Mad Men"" is slang for the admen working on Madison Avenue in New York City, the archetypal Men in the Gray Flannel Suits), ""Mad Men"" succeeds more from mood then plot. The action is focused on the nuances of facial expression that speaks louder than words at a time when true self-expression was unknown and unwanted. The plot itself centers on rising adman star Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has a secret past and his relationship with his suppressed wife, Betty (January Jones) who, although in therapy, is treated like a dependent child by her analyst who discusses her case only with her husband, not her. Elisabeth Moss shines as Peggy Olson, Draper's new secretary who is ahead of her time in terms of sexual liberation and professional intelligence. When she finally writes copy for a successful ad campaign (unheard of for the women in the office) she is condescendingly offered a drink, a pat on the back but no pay or no position. She chafes under her treatment and one wonders what the coming of the tumultuous Sixies has in store for her.

Which bring us to the children of the principal characters. All those cute little tykes running around with cowboy hats and cap guns will, within the coming decade, become hippies, anti-war protesters, feminists and environmental activists. Bob Dylan is still a year away from descending upon the scene but if there ever was a time that needed a'changing, it was 1960 America. The Beatles, Vietnam, and Kennedy's assassination are just around the corner but no one at Sterling-Cooper knows this or even has the imagination to envision the cataclysmic changes about to descend upon them. And when they do happen, will they notice or care?",1224633600,2,3233,4.9284403669724774

I generally watch things at random and don't watch a lot of shows consistently.  This is a show worth changing that for.  It's hard to describe what makes this show such a rare event in TV.  Somebody had the vision to put a show on TV that has something to say and is as raw, honest and true to the period it is based on.  I, for one, am grateful for that.

The show centers on the NY advertising world of the 1960s. Why ""Mad Men?""  The old row of famous agencies on Madison Avenue, of course.  The men are sexist, rude, slicked up, and well dressed. The women are submissive yet cunning, half accepting sexism and half ignoring it.

There's not a lot of political correctness here.  That is bound to offend some.  While my first reaction was to wonder as to the motives behind that, the truth is that after watching the show for a few episodes it becomes clear that the bigotry of the period is key to understanding the characters.  Plenty that the characters say would get them fired today. For their era, sexist banter in the office was considered par for the course.

There's also plenty of smoking, drinking and sexual situations.  If you are very conservative this might not be for you.  Yet even conservative people would have to warm up somewhat to the effectiveness of the portrayal. This show makes you believe you are witnessing things as they were. Not having been there, we can't know for sure.  Regardless, this sure is convincing.

There are some nice special features and extras sprinkled sparingly throughout the disks.  Of course you have your usual commentary tracks on the episodes, which are actually worth listing to in my opinion.  Not every show can say that.

The behind-the-scenes documentary section is also standard fare, but well done. It covers the basic elements of how the show is put together, from characters, sets, makeup, wardrobes, and art design. You also get some small extras that are nice like a segment on scoring the music for the show, which is great, and audio clips of some of the period songs that are used.

Because of the way the disks are set up, many of these specific extras are on the individual disks.  So you have to search for them. Also, there are only a few episodes per disk (about 3).  I guess those extras and commentary tracks took up a lot of disk space.  Still, these are minor details.

Conclusion

This is a great show and well worth watching again and again.  I hope you will check this out if you haven't already.

Men wanted all the freedom and none of the consequences.  Cynical manipulation was ramping up.  In some ways, much has changed.  And in some ways, nothing has changed.

The production values are incredible and the characters are irresistible.  You never know what gem will show up next.  Would you scold a child with a plastic bag over her head for leaving the cleaning on the floor instead of grabbing the bag off her?",1224201600,,559,4.51

3021555,4,B000YABIQ6,"Standing out against a backdrop containing a depressing number of boring sitcoms, brain-dead reality shows, and interchangeable law-enforcment procedurals, Mad Men is the kind of show that's been hastening my abandonment of network TV over the past several years.  Chronicling a year (roughly) in the life of Madison Avenue ad agency Sterling Cooper, Mad Men enfolds an unapologetic look at early-1960's American society into an intelligent and occasionally comedic drama series.  While the massive buzz might suggest otherwise, Mad Men is not in fact the best thing to happen to TV since color--the pacing could use some work, and the dialogue isn't always as clever or profound as it's obviously meant to be--but it's still nice to see a show this unabashedly cool and thoroughly absorbing.  Largely forgoing contrived plot twists and tiresome histrionics, the show instead breezes by on its unforced charm and subtle character dynamics.  Much has been made of the Mad Men's exacting recreation of a bygone era, and that attention to detail spills into every aspect of the show, giving it a colorful, vivid look and feel unlike anything else on TV.  Even when the characters aren't doing anything consequential, as in a late-season episode showing the staff killing time during the presidential election with the bosses gone, it's a blast just to watch them hang out.

Like many of the best shows of the past decade or so (think The Shield, The Wire, The Sopranos, etc.), Mad Men manages to juggle multiple plot and character arcs, generally bringing things along slowly until the pace accelerates in the wrenching final few episodes.  At the same time, its novel setting in the early 1960's and its high levels of personal, professional ,and sexual intrigue ensure that it manages to stand on its own as a compelling watch.  Especially fascinating is seeing the freewheeling portrayal of behaviors now considered archaic if not outright evil: rampant adultery and sexist objectification, smoking (even during pregnancy!), drunk driving, and, in one strangely alluring scene, the main character's mega-babe wife shooting the neighbor's birds in her backyard while puffing away on a cigarette.  Even though the show depicts a great deal of what would now be considered misbehavior, it never passes judgment on its characters or their era, nor does it engage in pointless nostalgia.  It just presents likeably flawed characters living by the conventions of a different time and leaves viewers to judge for themselves.

While Mad Men does an admirable job of developing a sizeable ensemble cast(which has continued in its even better second season), there's no question that the central character in the drama is Don Draper, Sterling Cooper's vaguely mysterious creative director.  Played in career-making fashion by the suitably stoic and square-jawed Jon Hamm, Don is easily one of the most unpredictable and inscrutable leading men on TV, not quite a hero and not quite an anti-hero, but a compelling figure nonetheless.  My wife succintly described him as a ""jerk,"" and while that label isn't entirely inaccurate, the writers gradually fill in the details of Don's past and reveal what's going on beneath his seemingly soulless exterior.  Even as he drinks heavily, cheats on his wife, and belittles subordinates, it's somehow easy to forgive Don his flaws, especially as the season wears on and the writers take us further into his head.  Similarly, a collection of (somewhat) ancillary characters who may intially seem one-note--reserved secretary Peggy Olsen, hard-living boss Roger Sterling, Machiavellian striver Pete Campbell, seductive office manager Joan Holloway--have their own aspirations and internal conflicts come out over time.

Mixing single-episode plots with longer storylines, along with the running thread of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential race (with Sterling Cooper working for Nixon), Mad Men has a lot going on from the very first episode.  For a show as busy and ambitious as it is, though, Mad Men remains extremely restrained and consistent, with few deviations from its focus on character and setting.  I for one found the plots focusing on Don's home life and his romantic entanglements less interesting than the show's examination of the workings of a business circa 1960 and the psychological underpinnings of advertising, but pretty much everyone should be able to find something here to enjoy.  Throughout its first season Mad Men keeps the complexity level high and rarely panders to its audience, which are qualities that just about everyone should be able to get behind.",1222992000,2,4608,5.270491803278689

3021558,5,B000YABIQ6,"MAD MEN is one of those series that is almost impossible to praise too highly.  It is also one of those series that puts on display the inherent superiority of television to the movies.  That is a sentiment that I find offends many, but one that more and more thinking men and women are coming to embrace as television gradually turns out one amazingly intelligent series after another.  Cinema is inherently limited on how much an individual movie can achieve in developing a complex narrative just as it is limited in how deeply it can explore character.  The reason is obvious:  a lack of time.  Delving deeply into the lives of a group of characters is a luxury movies simply can't afford.  The clock is ticking.

MAD MEN will, when it is finished, be a narrative of the sixties.  Season One begins in 1960k, shortly before the Kennedy-Nixon election.  Season Two moves almost two years ahead of that.  Subsequent seasons will move the story ahead by a couple of years each time, before coming to an end at the end of the decade.  The sixties was clearly the most remarkable decade of the twentieth century.  The world of 1970 has more in common with today in many ways than it did to 1960.  The changes in our attitudes can scarcely be assessed.  At the beginning of the series women all have their place in the office as servants to the men, accept passively their roles as eye candy and objects of sexual innuendo, and aspire to no more than moving up the secretarial rank.  A gay man in the office is so completely in the office that he seems oblivious to his homosexuality.  But by the end of decade would come the Stonewall riots and the Second Wave of the women's movement would be in full bloom.

One of the dominant themes of the show is the contrast between the world of today and the world of ""then.""  One of the most striking moments in Season One comes when Betty Draper's daughter runs into the living room wearing a body length plastic launderer's bag.  Betty sharply upbraids her, hoping that this doesn't mean that her laundry is laying on the floor.  To modern sensibility a child wearly a deadly plastic bad is shocking.  Or in a late season episode Don Draper allows his completely drunk boss to leave his house with a drink ""for the road.""  He merely smiles when he shouts, ""That's my car!"" as Roger drunkenly tries to find his own.  A pregnant woman at a party can be seen smoking while holding a martini glass.  One of my favorite MAD MEN scenes comes in Season Two, when after a picnic with his wife and kids, Don shakes the blanket they have all been sitting on, leaving the paper and trash on the ground.  It all highlights some of the progress we have made in discipling some of our more indefensible behavior.

As others have noted, the show centers on several ad executives at the Sterling-Cooper advertising firm.  In particular, the film focuses on Don Draper, a brilliantly creative ad exec who has been just as inventive in recreating himself as he has been in promoting the products of the firm's clients.  A serial adulterer, the child of a prostitute who died giving birth to him, and the son of an abusive father, he has had to pull himself from his humble origins to the top of his profession.  All this while protecting his own dark secrets.  Don Draper is a great character, perhaps the most archetypal character to have arisen since Tony Soprano.  And it provided the opportunity for overnight stardom for Jon Hamm, a previously only marginally successful actor who had mainly been distinguished by a string of very small parts on various TV series and small budget movies.  But it is impossible to imagine anyone more perfect for this role than Hamm and series creator Matthew Weiner agreed after seeing his audition tapes.  When the network insisted that Hamm be passed over for a more established actor, Weiner declared that without Hamm he was not willing to move forward with the series.  Weiner won and Hamm went on to win a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.  Draper is a world of contraditions.  At times unscrupulous, he is also capable of great magnanimity and moral rectitude.  A womanizer, he yearns for the ideal home.

The cast is stuffed with great characters and wonderful performances.  I absolutely detested Vincent Kartheiser as Connor on the series ANGEL, though even then I suspected it was more the way he was written than his performance.  Though he isn't asked to perform acts of daring do on MAD MEN, he is exceptional as Peter Campbell.  Like Don Draper he alternates from petty, self-serving moments to acts of kindness and loyalty.  He is capable of being wonderfully protective of Peggy Olson, a woman with whom he has had a couple of moments of physical intimacy, though he can also behave viciously towards her.  John Slattery is outstanding as Roger Sterling, the number two man in the firm and the son of the Sterling-Cooper cofounder.  Robert Morse, the great Broadway musical star of the sixties (including HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING), plays Betram Cooper, the head of the firm.  The almost unbearably beautiful January Jones (at one point in the season much is made of her resemblence to Grace Kelly, and she is gorgeous enough to make it not a silly compliment).  Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.  She also provides many of Season One's great moments, none better than when she starts killing the carrier pigeons of her next door neighbor with an air rifle (with cigarette dangling from her mouth) after he tells her children that he will kill their dog if they don't keep him out of his yard.  The gorgeous Christina Hendricks (who wears some padding to make her figure more Rubenesque and who was wonderful in the recurring role of Saffron on the Sci-fi series FIREFLY) plays Joan Holloway, the office manager.

After Don Draper, however, my favorite character on the show is Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss).  The series actually begins with Peggy's first day as a Sterling-Cooper employee.  Starting off as Don Draper's secretary, she soon shows that she has skills as a writer, and soon becomes valued as a copy writer with a sensitivity for products that appeal to women.  I've told friends that I believe that by the end of the series Peggy will actually be the head of Sterling-Cooper.  I think the centrality of Peggy to the show was shown partly by the show commencing with her first day there and with her unprecedented penetration of the all male hierarchy of the corporation.  Viewers may notice that she gains weight over the course of the year, especially during the last half.  In fact Elizabeth Moss gained no weight.  All changes were the result of very sophisticated make up art and padded clothing.

MAD MEN is one of the most beautifully designed shows you'll ever hope to see.  It may be surpassed by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and PUSHING DAISIES in art design, but no show on television rivals it in clothing.  The look of the show is impeccable.  If you don't remember the sixties, you can relive them by watching this show.

This is a show that anyone serious about quality TV has to know well.  I've watched Season One twice and plan on rewatching Season One and Two as soon as the latter has finished.  MAD MEN is also an example of a new trend in television, a series that tells more or less a unified story over the course of its life.  LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA both are doing this as well.  All are must-see shows.",1222905600,42,7849,4.659636363636364

3021590,5,B000YABIQ6,"I am so intrigued with this year's Mad Men series that I had to see last year's as well. The series is totally intriguing and ingenious; it's tip top.

Back in the 1960s, I was in my 20s and also in the workforce. My experience was very different from the secretaries on the show, as I started out as a young college professor and was always treated with lots of respect by male colleagues. However, a dear friend from that era and I have discussed the series together. She was in the secretarial field, part of the office staff, and experienced all the indignities suffered by the women on the show. The recounting of her experiences allowed me to understand what those women who show up crying in the ladies room are crying about - sexual advances from some male colleague.

The lives of the housewives depicted in the series are fascinating also. They lead me to vividly recall my own mother's life. And, of course, we all smoked! John Hamm's character, Don, is wonderfully mysterious.

I truly cannot recommend this series more. It is one of the absolutely best that I have ever seen. Enjoy!!

And ladies, we have indeed come a long way! I hope young women watch the show and gain a VIVID, TRUE UNDERSTANDING of how things were not long ago at all. This is truly the way it was.

3021598,5,B000YABIQ6,"""Advertising is about...happiness."" So declares Don Draper (Jon Hamm) to a client in one early scene of Mad Men, the richest and most complex program on television right now, at least in terms of its portrait of a specific period in American history.

Since so many of the great reviews here provide detail about the setting and basic premise of Mad Men, I won't repeat. I will simply say that no current TV show deals either directly or obliquely with so many interesting ideas and concepts as does Mad Men. Ostensibly about the New York-based ad industry in its early go-go days near the dawn of the TV age, Mad Men is really about a host of things, including:

The male-female dynamic in the pre-women's movement workplace, and its debilitating effects on women.

The rampant and causal repression of blacks, gays and women and the sense of entitlement among professional white males of the era that the world was their oyster.

The growth of a post-war generation of newly affluent Americans and how the ad industry played on their wants and desires to create artifical demand for unnecessary products, and in the process helped create a culture of consumerism, materialism and envy that is having ramifications even today (witness the mortgage crisis).

The early warning signs of the coming fractures in society that would explode only a few years down the road in the late 1960s.

Bottom line, Mad Men beautifully illustrates the irony of Draper's comment. Advertising, it argues, creates unhappiness - by convincing us that we always need to smell better, look better, and own better things, that nothing we currently have is as good as what we could have, whether that means our refrigerator, our car or our spouse.

But I hope I haven't given the impression that the show is a downer. Far from it. Mad Men is also a treat for the eyes in terms of how it captures the styles and artifacts of 1960 America - from the burled wood and frosted glass of the ad agency offices to the omnipresent ashtrays to the sleek Hart, Schaffner & Marx suits. The dialogue is sharp, the performances terrific (especially Elizabeth Moss as naive and ambitious Peggy Olson, Christina Hendricks as the secretary of every man's dreams, and John Slattery as roguish Sterling-Cooper partner Roger Sterling) and the production design impeccable.

We live in an age where the standards for television are higher than the standards for feature film are, and as such, I can't go along with all the rave reviews here.  The pacing is off, the plot points seem a bit disorganized, and the acting leaves some to be desired.

3021646,5,B000YABIQ6,"Wow, this series just took my breath away. It is a deeply thoughtful re-creation of America in 1960, as seen through the lives of the people at a fictional ad agency in New York City. This is a period of time that has rarely been explored in modern cinema.

I was a small child in the 1960s, but I still have vivid memories of that time.  America in 1960 was right at the cusp of sweeping social change. In 1964, LBJ passed the landmark Civil Rights Act; in 1965 he escalated the war in Vietnam.  In 1968, assassinations, riots, the Tet offensive, the sexual revolution, the rise of youth power (from what later became known as the baby boomers), and the election of Richard Nixon as President would start a long period that would  completely re-make American society.

We are indeed a much different society today than in 1960, but the true genius of ""Mad Men"" is that there is a much deeper layer to the way the series underscores the differences between then and now.

I remember the sharply defined gender roles, the men going to work wearing formal suits and ties, the women and their pointy bras, the incessant cigarette smoking (I hated cigarette smoke then and still do), the frequent presence of hard liquor (the style of new American houses of that era included built-in mini-bars for hard liquor and mixed drinks), and the casual racism (I remember seeing a ""whites only"" public drinking fountain for the first time as a child, and asking my mother what that was all about). Homosexuality was something almost unheard of, and definitely not discussed in polite company. Government sponsored warnings were about marijuana and unbecoming dating habits, not about cigarettes, alcohol, or the dangers of large plastic bags.

All of these aspects of 1960s culture are strikingly featured in ""Mad Men"".

The characters in ""Mad Men"" move about in realistic 1960s fashion - all men smoked back then, because they picked up the habit while in the armed forces, which gave out cigarettes in the ration packs. Married men screwed around regularly in secret, illegitimate children were conveniently packed off for adoption (as a child, in school, it was common to find schoolmates who were adopted), and the wives kept silent and divorces were far fewer than they are now. A gay character in the series has an encounter but has to closet his feelings.

We think we are so much smarter and better now than we were in 1960. In this time of Barack Obama, we are talking about a post-racist American society. We have sex education, we have birth control, we have legalized abortion, we have Mothers Against Drunk Driving and police sobriety checkpoints (Roger Sterling would surely have lost his driver's license in today's world), and in case that fails, we have air bags inside the cars. We have smoke-free airplanes, homes, restaurants, hospitals, etc. Smokers are treated like lepers (yea!). Women are empowered, we have Title IX, we have mandatory sexual harassment training in the corporate workplace, we have community property for marriages.

But are we really so much better off today than we were in 1960? By some health standards we are. Average life spans have increased. Traffic fatalities per mile driven were far, far higher back then than they are now. Men used to just keel over and die from a ""coronary"" when only in their 50's and 60's. That rarely happens anymore.

Racism has in fact not gone away, only changed in the details. Poor African-Americans in the cities have gone from being openly repressed to being incarcerated. And even though Hollywood now has black actors in every single movie or TV show (one suspects a quota system), many other minorities are still underrepresented. Muslims and Arabs are now the Negroes of the entertainment industry, portrayed only in stereotypical blackface.

And as unrealistic as the ideal nuclear family in 1960 may seem to us now, it was very real for the children of that time. I do remember that children were much better off then. We children played freely in the streets and backyards without parental supervision. Children usually had two parents, not one. Most children had stay-at-home moms. Parents had definite roles, parents were around, parents did not just break up and disappear as they do so often now.

Today, divorces have skyrocketed, we have children completely unmonitored by either parent because both are working or absent, and the large numbers of children born out of wedlock are no longer given up for adoption to families able to take care of them. Instead it has become the norm for single mothers to try to raise children themselves, often with terrible results for both mother and child. The numbers are huge. One out of three children are now born out of wedlock, two out of three in the African-American community. Women, having become empowered in the workplace, did not at the same time also gain the super powers needed to raise children alone; many men certainly saw this empowerment thing as an opportunity to skip out on their responsibilities as fathers.

Even cigarette and alcohol abuse have not been tamed so much as replaced by the worse problems of marijuana and cocaine.

The year 1960 was a special and yet transient moment in time for American society, the last moments of a pre-pubescent America, still the nave superpower of the post-WWII era, before it began the long, agonizing transformation into the confused, liberated, legalistic, and moralistic America of today.  This was a young, earnest, idealistic America that was on top of the world, one that thought it could do no wrong, thought it had the answers for everything.

And so finally, at the end of this brilliant first season DVD of ""Mad Men"", when we look deeper into what it really tells us, we see that what it says is, my goodness, how we have changed!  But have we changed all that much for the better?",1221350400,11,5876,4.841475573280159
3021647,3,B000YABIQ6,"In some of the Hype for this show the Sopranos is mentioned, do not rate this show as anything like or as good as Sopranos, it is OK, watchable, and how it won so many awards I am not sure about.

Anyway; The opening title sequence features credits superimposed over a graphic animation of a business man falling from a height, surrounded by skyscrapers with reflections of period advertising posters and billboards, accompanied by a short edit of the instrumental ""A Beautiful Mine"" by Aceyalone and RJD2. The titles pay homage to graphic designer Saul Bass's skyscraper filled opening titles for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and falling man movie poster for Vertigo (1958) - Weiner has listed Hitchcock as a major influence on the visual style of the series.

I was not impressed with the openining titles even knowing the above, it just for me did not fit in with era, and watching the 1st 2 episodes does not compliment it in anyway, it looks cheap.

Don Draper(Jon Hamm) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss aka Zoey Bartlet The West Wing) carry the first 2 episodes.  Elisabeth you were so good and sexy in The West Wing, were you hard up to be in this.

3021711,3,B000YABIQ6,"Mad men is almost great, but falls short. The acting is excellent. The capture of many period details is dead-on and many aspects of the story are compelling. But in the end, what kills so much good material is an overly melodramatic story and heavy-handed political writing more concerned with looking back than looking at the era. There is just way too much overly cute foreshadowing in a junkyard of 1950s cliches and stereotypes.

And for everything they got right in terms of the city and business, they got something wrong about life in the suburbs. What was missing was the ambitious cuthroat wives of the suburbs and the wives who didn't care what went on in the city as far as affairs as long as the goodies came in. They are too tied up in a one-dimensional world of ""wife-as-victim"". That was part of the era, but not the whole thing.

The final episode really killed things. The entire season told a very good and compelling story which turned into a melodramatic soap opera series of ""shock revelations"" which undercut everything built to over twelve episodes.

Everyone involved deserves tremendous praise for having so unexpectedly put together something like this. They came closer to capturing the atmosphere of business and being in manhattan than anything I remember ever seeing.

3021714,5,B000YABIQ6,I was just dumbfounded by the cultural references so obvious in this series especially how the writers must have used these books to develop the characters. How the women were pressured to marry 'right' whether out of a seven sisters college or by following the rules of gurley-brown to enjoy work in the pink collar ghetto because its serves a two fold purpose: to get a man and/or keep your mind off of being single.

3021719,5,B000YABIQ6,"Who doesn't love a good period drama?  I'm certainly not such a person, so upon hearing the idea of a cable series set on the Madison Avenue advertising scene as the nation stood on the cusp of the 1960s had enormous appeal.  Especially interesting is the HBO-style (indeed, this was originally pitched as an HBO series, and shot down; I'm grateful, if only because the DVD prices would be that much more severe) unvarnished presentation of the era.  Moralists who romanticize this period as a haven of old-fashioned morality will be disappointed when confronted by the truth (or something like it) about contemporary attitudes.

Our main character is Don Draper (Jon Hamm, in a marvelous performance; it is surprising that he doesn't do more period work, because he's absolutely perfect for the look of the 1950s), the creative director at Sterling Cooper, a moderate-sized ad agency run by Roger Sterling (John Slattery, best known to me from ""Jack & Bobby"") and Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse).  He and his team, most notably newcoming Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, Angel's son Connor on ""Angel""), are charged with marketing such illustrious products as cigarettes (and helping the company duck restrictions imposed by federal health agencies).  Don is something of a mystery both at work and at home, where his wife Betty (January Jones, in a revelatory performance; I'd previously never thought of her as anything other than a pretty face) is living a life of quiet desperation.  Through Don we see the life of a successful male executive; he's got a beautiful wife, more than one mistress on the side (proto-hippy Midge, then department store executive Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the only woman in the show not occupying a menial position, and she owes that to her father), and is friends with his boss Roger.  Below him, Campbell and his cohorts battle for favour and advancement.

Standout performances come from Hamm in the title role, Christina Hendricks as Joan, a secretary well-versed in using her sexuality to get what she wants (she'd be running the place if she lived 40 years later), and Elisabeth Moss as Peggy, a newby secretary with professional ambitions that are well beyond what is expected of women in that era, althoug timid Peggy doesn't seem the type to overtly identify with the feminist movement.

The DVD packaging has been a point of some contention here (see many of the 1-star reviews).  The original lighter-shaped box is a nifty design, though you do indeed have to watch while you close it (although the explanatory booklet in the back seems an effective shield on my set).",1219708800,,2615,4.988505747126437

Not only is it a top-notch show that makes an elegant crossover between the aggressive storytelling of cable and the low-key charm of network shows, but the attention to detail is worthy of any big-budget period film.

3021773,5,B000YABIQ6,"I was fortunate enought to catch the first airing of this series last year and was immediately impressed by the historical accuracy and attention to detail.  This is not to say that the story lines and acting aren't brilliant, because they are (which would account for all of the award nominations).  Set in 1960's Manhattan at a fictitious Madison Avenue advertsising agency, the stories follow two parallel paths:  the evolution of modern styles of advertising as a key function in Corporate America, and the personal lives of the people responsible for the incredibly creative ad concepts of the time.  The dialogue is often politically incorrect and its portrayal of women may make some viewers cringe, but having lived through the 60's I can say that it is a very accurate time capsule of the standards of the period.  Overall, it is a well written, very engaging and slightly nostalgic look back at a time when the ""medium was the message"".",1219276800,4,946,4.8875
3021774,3,B000YABIQ6,"I had very high hopes for Mad Men given the wildly positive reviews given in the press. I'm in advertising so the subject matter is interesting to me -- but this series is a tough sell.

I was bored beyond belief for the first two episodes, and had to force my way through the first disc. It was dull, plodding, and dreary. The show goes out of its way to show a 'slice of life' from roughly 1960, and sometimes in doing that they lose the momentum of the show.

It's difficult to like any of the characters so there isn't a lot of emotion to the story. The series doesn't really pick up until late in disc 2 when you see all the subplots start to intertwine. By the end of disc four you're interested in what happens, but frankly I wouldn't be disappointed if I never saw another episode.

The acting, set and costume design are all well done -- it just doesn't move fast enough.

There have been some complaints about the case but I have no problem with it. Closing it can be a little annoying when the discs don't line up with the slots correctly, but it's fine.

I like the Play All menu selection so you can watch all the episodes on a disc back-to-back. I'm glad to see they include that when so many other sets do not.

I really wanted to like this series more than I do. But I'm left with an ""eh, I can take it or leave it"" attitude.",1219190400,3,1341,4.138461538461539

It takes place in the 60's and the time period is as much a character of the show as the people are.  It is 100% accurate - the furnishings, clothes and THE SMOKING !!  It is hilarious but oh so true of the period.  Everyone smoked.

When you watch this show you are enthralled for it is one of those rare experiences today.  it is not gratuitous television.  It is a superbly crafted piece of art.  It is glorious how each character slowly develops over the season and we learn more about them slowly as you would a person in real life.  These characters become so addictive.  The ensemble cast is so amazing it is difficult to pick anyone out but Jon Hamm does certainly rule the roost with his presence.  But I am also sure Peter and Peggy will linger in your thoughts.

This is such intelligent television.  It is of the caliber you would expect from HBO or Showtime.  The historical facts are very interesting to me.  They show the whole campaign and election between Kennedy and Nixon.  I am 47 now so was not around for that.  It is so interesting to see that Kennedy was not so overly popular when running and it shocked many when he won.  The first Catholic president.  My, my.  I find that very timely with the election we are facing.

Nothing was spared to make this show the highest quality and the most accurate.  Anyone associated with it should hold their head high and it certainly deserves all the accolades it has received.

3021777,5,B000YABIQ6,"With the possible exception of Deadwood - HBO's magnificent Shakespearean noir-western - Mad Men defies easy comparison with virtually any television drama ever made. While much has already been written on the program's stunning recreation of mid-century cultural/corporate atmospherics and the big swinging casualness of its fidelity is optional lifestyle, the real focus for me is Sterling Cooper's creative chieftain, Don Draper.

He is a man of compromised emotion and is quite literally as ephemeral as the Brands he champions.

Draper's life is a canard, based entirely on an identity stolen from one of his dead Korean War comrades - with his lineage, education, breeding and comportment all fabrications in the service of his assumed identity. His wife is a prop to whom he owes no allegiance - his co-workers ""necessaries"" in the propagation of his fraud.

His is the ultimate fantasy played out within an industry that chews it like Pez. Draper's essence is one of physical inflection married to the danger of living in one's own head - where dialogue becomes superfluous, dangerous and far too revealing. It is the program's singular pleasure to watch Jon Hamm inhabit the role with such detached earnestness as if living on the brink of detection with every breath. His is a morality play of which Deadwood's Al Swearangen could be proud - and slightly envious.

Draper is far from the only thing in Mad Men worth watching. The entire supporting cast is outstanding led by Draper's wife Betty, played by January Jones. For me however, Hamm remains the nucleus of the program and is a tour de force.

I did take a couple of trips to New York at that time to do some work for the company that I was employed, and just going to New York to try and get a job in an agency. ""If you make it here, you can make it anywhere"" was the theme at the time, so everyone wanted to go to New York to get a job, primarily for the experience and the couple of lines on your resume that said so. This, finally, leads up to my review of ""Mad Men"", which I feel comes extremely close to accurately portraying what went on at that time. Visually, it is dead-on as far as details are concerned. I remember that time period looking just like that and feeling like that. I feel that as far as portraying advertising at that time and the beginning of the Doyle Dane Bernbach period is tucked in just the right way. My only slight criticism, and this is a bias since I have been part of the industry and teaching how to become part of it, I wish there were more scenes as far as how the agency functioned and maybe a couple more follow-throughs on specific accounts in the agency. But again, that is personal. Also, maybe just a little less ""soap opera"" between the characters, which does add to the change in women's position in the business and the real world. Enter the working woman/mother, etc. I feel that everyone should see this show. I also wish that season two would come out as soon as possible right after it is finished.",1217808000,,1852,4.234463276836158
3021828,5,B000YABIQ6,"In terms of writing (story, dialogue, character development) acting, direction, and the great, smoothly polished look of every frame, this fine show is as good as TV gets.  And it needs to be said that the best of TV in recent years -- Friday Night Lights, Damages, Battlestar Galactica, The Shield, and going back a few seasons, Everwood, Veronica Mars, Jack & Bobby -- outshines all but the absolute cream of movies.

Alas, the great bulk of television programming is still the ""wasteland"" it was long ago dubbed, but back in the 60s, 70s and 80s when there was almost nothing worth watching on the tube, I can recall that it was every TV actor's aspiration to graduate to ""features"" where the best work was being done (and where the big salaries were).

Today, however, for those actors fortunate enough to be working on shows like MadMen, or others of that caliber, they are already working at the pinnacle of their craft.  They are collaborating daily with the most talented people in their industry -- writers, directors, producers, set designers and fellow actors -- all of whom share an artistic commitment to do great work.  And it shows . . . in every aspect of every episode.

Viewed from the perspective of that kind of fulfilling work experience, the only remaining lure of most movies roles could only be the money.

MadMen is not just TV at its best, it is dramatic art at its best.  Check it out -- preferably on DVD!",1217808000,,1433,4.636363636363637
3021829,4,B000YABIQ6,"The oddest television series of the last decade is actually better on DVD because you can take your time, pause and replay, enjoy the ambience and 60's cachet. A series that is written, acted and dressed in 1960 may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you let yourself be transported back to that time, you'll enjoy this show tremendously. The characters are written with enough complexity to keep you interested, especially key mad man Don Draper, played with disturbing confidence by Jon Hamm. His enigmatic character touches the dark side in all of us, that little corner where secrets are kept and new realities are woven to accomodate them. Toss in institutionalized sexism, the relentless smoking of cigarettes and a sense of entitlement nurtured by television and you've got an edgy, completely original series that's deliciously dark and dangerous. Video quality is crackling clean. The 5.1 audio is subtle and there when you want it.",1217721600,9,943,5.012738853503185

This dream of the 1960s is simply beautiful to look at, but more importantly the world evoked is the setting for an exposition of human character and the human condition. The acting is incredible-- Jon Hamm especially. Each episode is a poem and the entire series is like a great mid-century novel. Thank you Matthew Weiner for this gem.",1217635200,2,417,4.712328767123288
3021861,5,B000YABIQ6,"It's no wonder this show is getting so much attention; there's nothing else like it on TV, nor has there been in quite some time.  Somebody is doing a fantastic job of art direction, re-creating 1960 right down to the last detail--and let's not forget all those drinks and cigarettes!
  They are also right on the money with the frustrated housewives and their unfaithful, dissatisfied husbands; the alpha male world of advertising executives; the barely contained sexual energy of the women who work as their secretaries.
  Jon Hamm is spot-on as Donald Draper, the creative director with the seemingly perfect life but a questionable past that he wants to leave behind but cannot; Elisabeth Moss is admirable as his secretary, Peggy, who looks like a pig-tailed school girl but has a tough and secretive side that is slowly revealed.
  The actors portraying Betty Draper, Peter Campbell (who knew that a smarmy little buggar could be a cad at the same time?), Roger Sterling, Burt Cooper, and others are an equal match for Hamm and Moss.  All of the work from the cast and crew has paid off in a big and well-deserved way.",1217548800,5,1124,4.787564766839378
3021862,5,B000YABIQ6,"Finally!  Mad Men proves that television doesn't have to be hackneyed storylines and writing.  At first glance, this series serves as an interesting portrayal of a period that is beginning to fade from cultural memory.  However, it will only take an episode or two to begin to appreciate the poignant themes and writing.  Each character is complex - there are parts of each that you love and hate - sometimes at the same time.  It's amusing to see the situations and themes that we hope don't exist today, but many ideas and circumstances that are universal to most people, regardless the time.

It's such a pleasure to finally find a series that justifies taking time out my schedule to sit back and take in.  The acting is top notch and the costuming and sets are superb.  I think a blog I recently read captured it best - ""I spend more time thinking about what I saw, then actual time watching the show.""

Everyone is comparing it to SOPRANOS for the obvious reasons, but to me it is much deeper than that great show.  It is really about what we (America) became after WWII and it explains a lot of who we are now.  Match it up with movies like SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, THE APARTMENT, and QUIZ SHOW and we're starting to detect a pattern here.  A smoky, sexist, lavish, and ultimately, empty one.

3021866,3,B000YABIQ6,"I recently watched all of the first season due to all the Emmy hype that is out. I was very disappointed and a little confused on why this is considered ""great"".  Don't get me wrong, it was interesting enough for me to watch all the episodes and tune in for the very disappointing Season 2 opener, but it was nothing outstanding to me.  I loved some dramas that were out like Dexter, The Tudors, etc. and thought the acting in them were Emmy material, but not Mad Men.  It's boring, slow, dull, but still for some reaons a little intriguing.  I guess what I really don't like is that you really never get to know the personality of certain characters.  Betty, for instance, is prim & proper one moment, and letting strange men in the house the next minute, and then out shooting neighbors pigeons the next.  I think a lot of the hype deals with the fact that it's set in a time period a lot of people (especially white males) would like to go back to.  Personally, it's kind of scary in my opinion.",1217203200,3,998,4.333333333333333
3021867,4,B000YABIQ6,"Normally, I avoid new shows on TV. After all nowadays, you begin to watch a show, really get into it, and in a few weeks it's cancelled because it's not pulling the demographic the network wants. So, I just wait to hear about the buzz surrounding a show before tuning in, usually after the first season has finished and people are still talking about it. Which is exactly how I discovered AMC's intriguing show ""Mad Men"", just releasing the disks and starting season two this past week.

It's very easy to see how this show can be seen with two sets of eyes, and gleam two contrary sets of meanings from Mad Men. The first set of eyes may watch this show and think, ""Oh, if only life was like that again"". They may pine for the ""good ol' days"", where everyone smoked everywhere, women were room decorations for men to ogle, drinking at work was the norm, even if you were driving or having a child, and men ruled the universe. The men worked long hard hours, and having affairs seemed to be the norm. In other words, the good old days.

The second set of eyes watches Mad Men and cannot help be frustrated and angry at the sexist, racist, homophobic society they are watching. Men openly tell sexist jokes that demean the secretaries in the office, and laugh loudly about it. At a party, another account exec chases a secretary, tackles her, and hikes up her skirt to show everyone her underwear. Two African-American people were fired after some money was stolen from a locker, even though one of them wasn't even in the building at the time. These eyes watch these events and think, ""I hope we've come farther than this.""

At first, watching this show, I didn't know what to make of it. Certainly I subscribe to the second pair of eyes, and wondered if this show was going to be constantly degrading populations of people. If so, that isn't entertainment. As the show gradually unfolds, I began to realize that wasn't the direction the show was going in. In fact, I couldn't honestly tell you what direction it was going in.

When spunky and talented new secretary Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) leaves some copy with office nefario and universal jerk Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, where did this talented actor come from?), you'd expect the usual ""He steals the copy as tries to pawn it off as his own"", knowing full well he would do that, and Peggy would be left with no repercussions.  Only creator and writer Matthew Weiner is much too smart for that. Instead, Pete never even gives the copy any attention at all, which is more revealing of his character and the times. Score one for Weiner.

So the first season zigs and zags, and I found myself angered at times, surprised at times, and laughing at times. Jon Hamm plays the main character Donald Draper with such a 50's ruggedness, he could easily be plucked into any 50's film and immediately fill in. Ad whiz kid, Don carries a secret, and it's not his mistress or a Jewish department store manager that hires his firm. The secret to his identity was an interesting story, but one that ultimately wasn't too ""big"" when revealed. His affairs against his Grace Kelly look-a-like wife Betty played by Janaury Jones, are extremely frustrating to me. His virtuous persona jars against his philandering, and that probably makes his character ultimately more interesting. Betty herself has more problems of her own, numb hands, an unethical psychiatrist, and a new divorcee in the 'hood.

For me, the show all comes back to Peggy. I hope beyond hope that Weiner has great plans for Peggy. Taken by itself, the first season of Mad Men could be frustrating, but knowing that women's rights began to emerge in the 60's, I'm hoping among hope that Peggy's journey will represent that eventual change. As Don recognizes her talent, she moves from the secretary pool to junior copy writer. Let's hope that more men at Sterling and Cooper recognize her talent. Both her and Don together make an amazing professional team. I can see her speaking at his retirement dinner in the 1980's, she has founded her own advertising firm and credits her early start to him.

So, I went from some confusion, to anger, to liking the show, to really liking it. Can I say that I love the show? Not yet, thus the four star rating. I'm eagerly going to watch season two. I have to give kudos to AMC for producing this show. It's about time that interesting, provocative television series move from the limited availability that pay-per-view channels provide, into the cable that is available to anyone with a box.

True quality in every detail from office settings, home furnishings, to clothing styles.  You can't be dissapointed with this show! The acting from all the cast is fantastic and I especially enjoy seeing the mighty attractive characters (Betty & Joan)!

The show can transport me back to a time in the country I never experienced but wish I did. It is a true pleasure to watch these characters portray real people from that time period. Those who didn't always take life so serious (some of them anyway), could laugh and not have to worry about offending someone, drink and smoke and no one tried to make them feel like a criminal.

3021900,5,B000YABIQ6,"The extreme accuracy of detail in depicting those years is impressive. Most interesting, however, is about content.  Discussing this Series with my wife, I absentmindedly said, about the character of Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, ""He's a good man.""  She said, ""No he isn't!""  I then realized, and told my wife, ""That's how he gets away with it!""  What does he get away with?  Well, everything.  He is such a good point man for the company the owner/boss does not care when the weasel tells the boss about his identity theft. A side issue there is, of course, the weasel, Pete, who has committed a Federal crime by opening mail that is not his, is so smart he is stupid.  Why? It's the same reason Draper willingly takes him into the boss's office to reveal the ID theft, realizing that Pete is not realizing that the real big killer info is that Draper is a Jew. Don might as well quickly take Pete up on his threat to go to the boss, rather than submit to blackmail, as soon as possible before Pete gets around to thinking about the real career killer, right? That is not in the show yet, but I bet it will be, eventually. (Wonder why Don got along so well with Rachel?) If Pete had deduced that, then Draper would never take him to the boss.  Telling the boss about an upsetting issue the boss would not care about is a whole lot different than the worst thing anyone, anywhere, even his wife could find out. Notice how Don did not hesitate taking Pete to the boss?  You wait.  At least that is what I would be writing into the scripts. With the archaic attitudes of that company's brass, about Jews, that info would have gotten Draper fired and blacklisted, which, of course, from our point of view now days is about as stupid as smoking all the time.  Thank heavens things have evolved!
Don's wife is played so well.  Don is so good at everything she is happy to be the zero she is. Constantly made aware of how lucky she is, she sits in agonizing unhappiness, the reason for which she cannot explain nor express even to herself. She is so unhappy.  They all are.  This show is so well done that it ranks right up there with the best of Shakespearian Tragedies. At every turn we are shown their pathetic, truly unhappy existence, all of them, all the time, no matter what any of them are endeavoring to accomplish, no matter what roles they play. It's genius!  It's one of the saddest stories ever produced in the entertainment world.",1216944000,5,2440,4.427293064876958
3021901,5,B000YABIQ6,"I actually hadn't heard of this show until I was looking at The Wire here on Amazon. Mad Men was linked from one of the pages so I read through the reviews. With so many positive, I decided to take a shot.

I was hooked after two episodes and watched the entire first season in about 10 days. The show revolves around advertising executives on Madison avenue in the 1960's. The characters are believable and well developed. The dialog is terrific. It is also interesting to see what things were like in the 1960's. For example, the execs all sexually harass their secretaries on a regular basis and it seems to be almost expected.

Watching this series I have found myself empathizing with many of the characters, which isn't a flattering statement.

I am very pleased that HBO are the not the only ones pulling their weight by coming out with good quality film on television ... down with network sitcoms!!!!",1216944000,,909,4.633540372670807
3021902,5,B000YABIQ6,"A secretary's allusion to McLuhan four years before the publication of UNDERSTANDING MEDIA has been cited as a rare anachronism in this meticulous reproduction of 1960.  Aside from one editing glitch (involving a woman's cigarette that is held upward then lapward then upward a number of times), my main ""glitch watch"" observation surrounds a home-movie camera that is treated like a videocamera:  lacking intense lights clamped to chairs for indoor shooting, lacking the need to hand-wind the film every few feet, or lacking the whir of a motor.

(It's also a kick to see Angel's karate-wheeling son emerge here as a lesser corporate demon.  Perhaps Season 3 can link up his character with his own long-lost brother, played by Wil Wheaton.)

This series's main competition for Emmy awards is the excellent DAMAGES.  But depraved nastiness is an easy staple for cable shows, while the intricacy of MAD MEN (without excessive, facile cussing and with a minimum of wish-fulfillment fantasy sequences) sets it apart from the conventions of even the best of television dramas.

The series is just about as fantastic as it lauds itself for being, on the commentaries.  Its creator ""loves"" everything, and other commentary participants slobber big wet kisses on each other--as has become a tradition in disk packages of this kind.  Clearly deserved for costuming and set design, also appropriate for writing and performances, yes; but pointing out parallel themes (a la THE WIRE) is a frequent achievement of greater value.

Some of the technical commentaries (notably on costuming, producing, editing, directing) are as good as any ""field trip"" classes I took in grad school, with production personnel at various Manhattan television stations.  Film teachers would do well to assign these commentaries at any level of ""film production"" instruction.

This, however, is countered by the endless redundancy of Elizabeth Moss who, as Peggy Olsen, does a good acting job but, on the commentaries, finds a dozen ways to repeat the same simplistic idea ... over and over and over and over throughout many, many episodes.  It's nice to have so many commentaries on the disks, but this actress's vacuous chatter is too often used as filler.  She is clearly the production's mascot, but her additions to commentaries for Season 2 should be edited judiciously.

Immediately after watching these 13 episodes about the ad industry in 1960, I viewed MADISON AVENUE (1962) with Dana Andrews as a somewhat older, less complicated clone of Dan Draper, a love interest named Peggy, a Joan-like secretary named Miss Olsen, the actor who later played Larry Tate from BEWITCHED here performing the role of a precursor of Tate, and even the line ""You haven't thought this through.""  Hardcore MAD MEN addicts might enjoy this strangely uncynical addition to the PATTERNS, GRAY FLANNEL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, HOW TO SUCCEED, WALL STREET genre.",1216944000,4,2909,5.183760683760684

I desperately wanted to like it, but I found it to be just ok.  The only characters that I was interested in were Peggy (played expertly by Elisabeth Moss) and also Pete (wonderfully played by Vincent Kartheiser).  Most of the other characters were boring to me.  Most of the storylines, although interesting, were far from compelling.  In fact, they became repetitive.

Sure, the show is very well acted.  It is also technically amazing, evoking the early 1960s in every scene.  I just wish the storylines had drawn me in a bit deeper.  I wanted to care, but I didn't.",1216857600,2,834,4.715277777777778
3021905,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is the first original drama series from the cable network AMC and they hit it out of the ballpark.  Set in 1960 and focusing on a fictional advertising agency Sterling Cooper, the show tells the story of ad men in a haze of cigarette smoke and booze.  The first episode foreshadows the change in our culture as the firm struggles to find a new advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes now that the government won't allow them to use testimonials from doctors that cigarettes are safe.  The show is fanatical with its attention to period detail.  Show creator Matthew Weiner has extensively researched the products, clothes and just about everything else from the period and has created a picture perfect time warp. But that is just a shiny veneer for the deep and dark storylines that include a secret past with a changed identity, depression, heart attacks, infidelity and so many others.  The show shoots off in so many directions, yet never loses focus.  The anchor of the show is Jon Hamm who plays the main character Don Draper.  Mr. Hamm is a revelation and his work is the best of any actor on television this year.

Simply put, Mad Men is one of the best shows I have ever watched and without a doubt the best season of television I have seen since the first few seasons of The Sopranos.

The story arc is enthralling, and the talented group of actors do a tremendous job of giving life to every character in the show.  For anyone looking for a show that is at times dramatic, funny, shocking, and endearing, but always excellent, look no further.  I highly recommend not only this show, but this blu-ray version as it is a tremendous deal for 13, 1-hour episodes.

Speaking of blu-ray, the picture quality is fantastic.  Colors bounce off the screen, and those with 1080p sets will be constantly surprised with the level of detail givin to even specs of facial hair, or the weavings of cloth on clothing.

3021907,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is one of those very rare TV shows that is both superb and popular.  Sometimes there really is a TV god.  Unlike great shows like Friday Night Lights, people are watching and the awards are rolling in - 16 Emmy nominations, more than any other drama this year.

It's 1960 in a Manhattan based advertising agency.  The men have slicked back hair, crisp white shirts and perfect suits.  What comes out of their mouths would get them slapped or sued if it happened today.  Toots, babe, honey.  Women are sex objects and they have less brain power - as one character says, ""It was like watching a dog play the piano"" when a certain female character with professional drive and passion exceeds the lowly expectations of the men.

The women are no better.  The head secretary tells another female that they (the men) designed the technology so simple that even a woman can use it.  A mother smokes and drinks while pregnant and ignores the danger of a nearby child playing make believe with a plastic drying cleaning bag over her head.  Some of the women act childish because that's the role that's been forced upon them.  Others are starting to reject the social strait jacket and are rebelling - it's the beginning of a new era and they are the foremothers of what is about to hit this nation like a baseball bat to the head.

The wall paper in one house is plaid and the cars are big and many have tail fins.  There's a cigarette in almost every scene - people cough and there's no recognition of any connection in their minds.  One major character smokes, drinks and eats with abandon and almost dies of a heart attack with, again, no recognition of cause and effect.

This show, unlike any on air or cable at this time, immerses you in its era.  It's authentic, real and grabs your attention.  Quite simply, if you watch only one current show on TV this year it should be Mad Men.

Several reviewers have commented on the packaging.  While it is a little more delicate than others, it's still cool (it's like a cigarette lighter) and you can handle the DVDs without damaging them.  The DVDs are held in the case with a foam insert that doesn't scratch the surface.  When you take the DVDs out you have to gently push against the top side with your (clean) fingers and gently push upward.  They will come out and you won't smudge or scratch the surface.  If the DVDs are getting damaged it's because people are just grabbing both sides of the disc and pulling it out.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not been impressed with other boxed sets where you end up literally breaking the plastic sprockets that hold the DVDs in place.  If you want really poor packaging just look at the complete West Wing.  In any case, you can handle these DVDs and not damage them.

The extras here are sparse but very good nonetheless.  There's an hour long behind the scenes docu that looks as all aspects of the show from character backgrounds to hair and art design to the actors feelings about their characters.  It's not full of that fluffy hype stuff you find on other DVD sets where they just show you short clips from the show and present it as somehow something new.  You'll actually learn something about the show.  I would love to see full interviews with all the actors to talk about the characters they're playing.  Maybe we'll get that in the season 2 set.  As noted by others, the commentaries are minimal and a bit disappointing.  Doesn't really matter in the end as it's still a superb show you simply shouldn't miss.",1216512000,131,3520,4.515822784810126

3021939,5,B000YABIQ6,"It would be hard to imagine a more absorbingly intelligent American TV series--in terms of writing, acting, and visuals--than MAD MEN. Just before the final season of THE SOPRANOS began in late 2007, AMC presented us in the summer with the thirteen episodes of this marvelously atmospheric series created by one of the main writers of the series, Matt Weiner, that HBO insanely took a pass on. Ostensibly the series is about a group of advertising agency working for Madison Avenue advertising agency, the fictitious Sterling-Cooper, in 1960, during the Nixon-Kennedy presidential contest; yet on a deeper level the show wrestles with much larger questions about the meaning of obsession with having (and marketing) happiness in mid-20th-century America. The series centers primarily around four characters whose lives are inextricably linked with one another: Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a handsome advertising executive at Sterling-Cooper of few words but enormous creative gifts who hides a mysterious past; his beautiful but childlike wife Betty (January Jones), whom he keeps entirely separate in the suburbs from his work life and his mistresses in the city; Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), Don's new secretary, whose naive affect and kind heart belie her tremendous ambition; and Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), the smarmy account executive who trades on his ties to the Old New York ""Knickerbocracy"" to get him ahead. The four central actors are absolutely first-rate, as are several within their near orbits: John Slattery as Roger Sterling, the roguish partner who is both Don's friend and his competitor; the gifted Christina Hendricks, as the firm's femme fatale head secretary; and Robert Morse, as the firm's wily and eccentric senior partner.

Morse's presence ties the series to his famous work in both the Broadway and Hollywood production of HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, and the episodes make intelligent reference also to any number of important American fictional works about the NYC business and suburban domestic worlds of the post-War era, including THE APARTMENT and THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. (Richard Yates's REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and the films of Douglas Sirk are also repeatedly evoked too, if in less direct ways.) One of the pleasures of this fine DVD set are the superb extras which allow us to see the especially thoughtful work done by the series' set designers, hairstylists, and (particularly) its head costume designer. The commentaries are generally excellent, and it will come as no surprise to fans of the series that not only the series creator, Matt Weiner, and its writers are especially eloquent but so too are its actors, especially Hamm and Kartheiser. The eye-catching design of this DVD package (fashioned to look and open, naturally, like a classic American manufacturer's product: a Zippo lighter) has been rightly praised for its innovation but also rightly criticized for its unwieldiness.",1215907200,278,2952,5.334763948497854

I didn't watch it when it was originally shown - I didn't think I would like it, but I  really had my head up my butt on this one.  My husband and I were hooked after one episode and had to go out to the video store the next day for the other 3 DVDs.  I plan to buy it.  The writing, acting and production values are all top-rate.  I love the characters.  I haven't seen most of the actors before, but they were perfectly cast. I can't believe HBO passed on this show.

Anyone else have this problem?",1215820800,5,345,4.359375
3021942,5,B000YABIQ6,"From the first episode, I was hooked! It's definitely something special.

I loved the series, and wanted it on DVD, but wondered if I would actually watch it once I got it. The answer is a resounding yes! Watching it again, I find that I catch little details and snippets of background dialogue that I missed on first viewing. I got it yesterday and have already watched two of the four DVD's. It's even more delicious on second viewing. I will definitely watch this again and again. I can't wait for Season 2.",1215561600,2,554,4.285714285714286
3021944,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is one of the best written shows currently on TV. HBO and Showtime were foolish to pass up this amazing show. Mad Men is also brilliantly acted and the costume/set design is fantastic.  A must buy on Blu Ray due to the amazing encoding, that makes this slick 60's world look its absolute best.  I long for the old days of New York!",1215302400,4,336,4.234375
3021945,4,B000YABIQ6,"AMC once again proves itself a worthy adversary to HBO and Showtime for producing a quality and highly literate television experience. Time spent viewing ""Mad Men"" is not a passive couch potato exercise calculated to generate a momentary knot of personal nostalgia. The experience is much more than that. Like ""The Apartment,"" a major motion picture released in 1960 and mentioned in this series captures the very essence of big city urban 1960 culture and is utterly convincingly in ways both broad and subtle. The look and feel of the time is spot on. Some of what is defined in ""Mad Men"" may shock current PC culture sensibilities as relates to race and gender relations. At its core, ""Mad Men"" provides the viewer with a blistering and not too flattering look at ourselves and our entrenched culture of consumerism as strong today as it was nearly a half century ago. Jon Hamm leads an inspired cast of little known actors portraying reticent and mysterious Donald Draper, a highly sought after ad man and selling genius. Elisabeth Moss gets second billing as Peggy Olsen, Draper's wide-eyed new secretary. Moss's acting resume includes a stint as young Zoey Bartlett, daughter of the President in ""West Wing.""  As for Hamm, he would make a convincing James Bond and depending upon the camera angle, ever present obscuring cigarette smoke and dim lighting proffered in any given scene, his tall, dark and handsome masculinity contains uncanny elements that are at times mildly suggestive of a young Timothy Dalton, Robert Di Niro, even Kevin Kline. Madison Avenue is reknowned for cynically packaging products or political personalities for retail sale but the consumer's ultimate acceptance is an exercise in free will that is heavily influenced by the cunning efforts of men like Draper. Whether Draper is signed on to promote cigarettes, aerosol deodorant, an upscale department store, presidential candidate or even promoting the state of Israel, he brings a cold and calculating hard edged view of the world to the table. It may be true that the incessant cigarette smoking and hard drinking during regular business hours by almost all of the brilliantly defined characters in ""Mad Men"" is no longer de rigueur, the compulsion towards self-destruction has not changed one whit. No one defines that trait better than gifted actor John Slattery who plays Draper's boss, Roger Sterling. As a partner in the adveristing agency, Sterling is at once a likeable fellow and yet morally repugnant. Slattery pulls off the character effortlessly. The secondary male characters in ""Mad Men"" are well acquainted with feelings of ennui. Many in Drapers's staff for the most part married yet openly pursue self-gratifying liaisons with willing female co-workers with feminine agendas of their own. Some things have not changed one whit in all these years, even as the unadjusted price for a gallon of gas was around 30 cents in 1960 and tops $4.00 a gallon today.  The prices for virtually all commodities may have changed over the years but rest assured, people and their inate capacity to be gulled has not. You'd think we'd know better by now. That is the essential genius and overarching message contained within ""Mad Men."" The successful ad man accepts as an article of faith that the pitch and ultimate message should always contain or vaguely suggest a measure of happiness or bliss associated with the product whether that product be packaged in pill form, a breakfast cereal, an enhancement to health or desirabilty, the only goal is to convince the consumer to open up the pocketbook and buy into the come hither promise of ""new and different.""  Simply put, ""Mad Men"" is brilliantly crafted TV that unabashedly drives that message home.",1215216000,6,3740,5.048543689320389
3021946,3,B000YABIQ6,"The show itself is fabulous.  And I'm pretty sure most of the people hitting this page would agree.  Otherwise, why else would you be here?  You've seen the show, you love it, and you just want to know whether or not to buy the DVD.

Yes, you totally should.  Because the show's brilliant, and therefore you should support it.

The packaging is horrendous.  It looks awesome.  Zippo lighter shooting out flames.  The flames are the problem though.  You have to be really careful taking the discs out (set up stadium style) as you're going to get your fingerprints all over them.  And you have to be super careful closing the box, as the way it's set up, you end up scratching the discs.",1215129600,26,686,4.495934959349594
3021947,5,B000YABIQ6,"I had heard a something about this show in some magazine (Wired?), and then I saw it at the store in a cool enlarged Zippo shaped case.  The only reason I purchased it though was because I recognized one of the actresses from Firefly.  Once I started watching I really enjoyed the 60's they created.  Not sterile but controlled, chauvinistic but poking fun... Lots of lovely ladies, drinking, smoking, and some clever writing.  Since it is only the first season, I suppose its only going to get better.  I've not listened to the commentaries or watched the special features yet but it's cool that they are there.  I will most likely purchase the next season.

One note, as an Ad and Lucky Strike junky, I was very irritated from pilot where they tried to introduce the ""It's Toasted"" slogan by Don Draper in the 60's.  It actually came out in 1917, and was more than likely closely linked to the real granddaddy of advertising Edward Bernays.  They might have considered turning his life into a show, but once I started to watch the other episodes the minor deviations from facts for the sake of entertainment didn't seem so frustrating.",1215129600,4,1137,4.673366834170854

The only thing on there of note is the ""making of Mad Men"" - c'mon. I love this show - couldn't you be a bit more creative - maybe interviews with the actors, stock footage of 1960s era original advertising, easter eggs, blooper reel, screen tests - all the other goodies you expect to get in addition to the episodes.
This shouldn't be construed as a knock at the show itself - which is picture perfect - but if you are going to sit on a DVD release for 10 months at least make it worth the wait. I expect more from Season 2 DVD box Lionsgate / Weiner.",1214956800,11,672,4.052631578947368

If you've got the sense of humor to laugh at how reckless we used to be and how safe and sanitized we've become you have to pick this show up.",1214697600,4,597,4.537037037037037
3021983,5,B000YABIQ6,The best show on TV.  Terrific acting.  Top shelf writing.  An original concept delivered with consummate skill.,1214265600,8,112,5.470588235294118
3021984,5,B000YABIQ6,"The summer of 2007 is when Mad Men swept the nation. Why? It is anti-politically correct. It is an intelligent, thinking man's (""persons"" would be too PC for *this* show)) show for adults. Not to mention the fantastic, Rod Serling-esque realism in the quality of its writing, the direction, the scope, and the dazzling work of the previously unknown cast - now all certified household names - stars, if you will (none will ever have to worry about getting future work).  The best part of this casting is that there are no familiar public-entrenched ""personalities"" to disturb the continuity and believability of the proceedings; a ""star"" would have interupted the realism of the story and surroundings. And, in the process, we get to discover a whole new set of actors (their work and camaraderie is gaspingly satisfying, the most sheerly pleasurable in recent memory).

Matthew Weiner, the show's genius creator, has painstakingly ensured that we're really getting a believable early 1960s. There's not an irritatingly currently contemporary viewpoint to be found anywhere. Of course the show is depicted in a hindsight manner; but all of the dialogue, situations and characters are all breathtakingly, reassuringly of a past time. Despite the deceptively, smoothly stylized look via the posh sets and clothes, the atmosphere is constantly invaded by the smog of cigarette smoke; we're not used to seeing such flagrant puffing and inhaling on film. You can almost smell the overfilled ashtrays. No one goes outside to smoke here. This is the Martini and Rossi era, and everyone in corporate America smoked and drank as if it were part of the life and job description. Then, too, you see women used as business, sexual and marital props. They existed to serve their men (and I hope the PC feminists are in a tizzy, because they should be). To provide their dictation, their pleasure, their masculine image, their food, their offspring. Of course, we see in Joan, the foxy, knowing secretary, using the men in return to get what she wants; and we see in Don Draper's wife (brilliantly, tensely enacted by January Jones) an all-pervasive, unnameable malcontentedness. We see the glaring dichotomies of the men, looking Madison Avenue dapper, but behaving and displaying attitudes of overgrown high schoolers. Most of these men, from today's standpoint, are bastards; and no attempt is made to Ralph Nader or Alan Alda-ize them (it would be interesting to have the series run into the late 1960s, when these men are forced to run into the massive social consciousness that emerged in a shockingly short time later).

Most of all though, the tone of the show is presided over by the brilliant Jon Hamm, whose Don Draper is the most multifaceted character on television in ages. Hamm is blessedly allowed several moments in deep repose, and we can see the massively disturbed soul behind the savvily successful executive. And yet the character's troubled mien allows him to understand human nature, therefore key elements in advertising - how to emotionally ensnare the public into believing the merit of a product or slogan. He's also smart enough to see that Peggy (wonderfully played by Elizabeth Moss), the secretary, with her questioning, probing mind, has a depth unavailable to most of the male executives, to provide key insights into how to sell a product. Hamm's Don Draper is already a classic, public-entrenched persona.  It is a stunningly limned portrayal.

The great strength of this show is its quietly commanding, un-TV-like sense of pacing. You wouldn't call this a suspense show, yet the bottled-up, stealthy sense of pacing keeps us in a tantalizingly unnerved state; you always wait for that cork to explode unexpectedly. The brilliance here is that the explosion factor doesn't always come when we expect it; but the build-up leads us to believe it will. Those explosions come when the build-up has not been prepared, and happens in a swift, tightly controlled manner, never spilling over into predictably cheap shock value.
After each show, we smile, having been on the edge of our seats, engrossed, and left deeply satisfied - and impatient for next week. Thursdays at 10:00. Phone turned off, a glass of wine or spirits.

Another great asset to the overall tone is the darkly cynical humor. Never overplayed or explicitly self-conscious, it nevertheless ingeniously, deftly exposes the foibles of human nature. The most overt humor is slyly depicted by Christina Hendricks, whose eye-poppingly Kim Novak-voluptuous, leeringly confident secretary Joan is an absolute delight. Hendricks looks and acts so unerringly real of the time period, it would be a shock to see her as she really is in real life. She and John Slattery, perfectly playing the sloppily amorous boss, create genuine sexual edge in their scenes together.

Vincent Kartheiser, playing Pete Campbell, an insecure, untalented but ruthlessly ambitious business and social climber, is scarily effective; there's an element of genuine danger in this character. Campbell is so aware of his limitations, and you sense he'd stop at nothing to prove himself.

The good-time unreformed Frat-elevated-to-biz-executive contingent, played by Rich Sommer, Aaron Staton, Michael Gladis, and Bryan Batt, strike just the right notes; they're all joyfully oversexed, blithely good-time, but very real, and we get to see inside their characters.

Robert Morse, the only familiar name in this cast, is perfect as the head of Sterling Cooper, a boss who cares not what goes on as long as the money rolls in.

I hope Mad Men will be on for years to come. HBO's loss is AMC's considerable gain - and is the best-written, best acted show of our time. It will be heralded, discussed, and acclaimed for years to come, and be held as the classic show it has already become. I have never enjoyed something so much as this intriguing, wonderfully engrossing drama. Cheers and thanks to all those involved.",1214092800,166,5962,5.099385245901639
3021985,5,B000YABIQ6,"I experienced a visceral reaction to Mad Men unlike any response I've had to a television show for a long time.  The show elicited a feelings of security and insecurity, comfort and discomfort.  The rigid social structure had me reflecting on a time very early in my life but had a continuous effect in shaping the adult I would become.  As a kid in 1960 I was very aware of racial prejudice and remember the subservient roles played by men and women like the ones cleaning the offices and running the elevators or so told to me with anger and disapproval by my parents and other adults.  I remember my mother dressing in the style of Betty Draper and learning lessons on ""proper"" comportment.  I remember how tall (like Dan Draper) my father was and the uneasy but comforting smell from my father's cigarettes. I remember how cute my mother looked in pedal pushers and how we went on family picnics together.  Only as I have grown older can I relate to Don Draper's darkness and the darkness of racial and gender prejudice in American society. Are we so different now?

I agree with other reviewers that a lot of fascinating tension comes from the time period: all the rigid professional classes and gender roles are on the brink of collapse--or are they just about to sneak underground? It all looks so shocking yet so familiar...

The social strata and class labels of ""secretaries"", ""bosses"" and ""wives"" and their assigned roles and duties is sheer brilliant drama and the frustrations of those in the classes is effectively conveyed to us.  You can see the 60's ready to explode with the liberation of all these classes and ""free"" the women from the men, the men from their almost god-like bosses (having to take off their shoes to enter his office like entering a temple) and the general workplace poplulation from onsite smoking and drinking and carousing.  it makes you wonder how would life today be if things were still like that, but i get the feeling that the creator's purpose is not so much to contrast, but to juxtaposition, to make you really think... did it really change?... is it really any different now?......

I watched the entire first seas and part of the second season, as of yet. It isn't bad. Not nearly as fantastic as all the hype. It definitely shows how things were, without pulling any punches. A lot of sexism, excessive smoking, drinking whiskey at work and cheating on wives. People were unhealthy and would do anything to make a sale. I still do not care much for any of the characters, but overall it is a decent series.",1515283200,,539,4.4

The show is very, very, very slow and not much action. I grew up watching classic movies with my mom so I really like the 50's and 60's so I enjoy the costumes, props and set. I do notice how much everyone in the office drinks during the day not sure if people in those days drank that much, if they did that is crazy!

3252878,4,B000YABIQ6,"I did not watch this show during it's run and usually wait to binge on it as I just did.  It's a groundbreaking period piece that takes you through the entire 60's as seen through the eyes of the employees of a Madison Avenue advertising agency.  Production value is absolutely superb. With all the hype, I was a bit surprised at the slow pace of the show and the characterization of Don Draper.  Draper is an ad executive that's supposedly brilliant, but deeply flawed with a troubled past.  So right off the bat the protagonist is someone you can't really get behind and seriously will let everyone down in his life, yet still achieves success and riches.  He's someone you you want to root for instinctively at first, but you wind just easing into watching his train wreck of a life unfold.  Since I work in a corporation in a similar role the episodes kind of reminded me of living through elements of my own professional life but with the flawed people we would have fired instead of the truly brilliant professionals that last in today's workforce.  But that's the charm of the series.  It's that the norms in the 60's don't apply to today's society and the seeds of what we have today were just sown then. So I stuck with the series and while it didn't blow me away with really sharp story telling, it did take me on an interesting ride that doesn't insult my intelligence like the empty minded cheap sitcoms the networks try to force down our throat.",1475193600,,1458,4.517110266159696

3252882,5,B000YABIQ6,"Im going to talk about setting for a minute since everything else has been said.

I used to have a world cultures teacher that would give us a map of the continent we were studying for that particular quarter and hed give a list of countries, capitals, rivers, ect. If we identified everything accurately on the list, he would grade you. D-minus.

He told us that extra effort yield extra grading and that doing the minimum would get you the minimum grade.

Okay then, some of use would identify every city in a country by buying a .3mm mechanical pencil and microscopically identify every village along the Amazon in Brazil.

Anyways, I tell that story because when a movie or show gets the setting absolutely dead on accurateD-Minus!

Mad Men gets an A+ for setting. They don't just get it accurately, they incorporate it into the character of Don Draper. The story takes place during a time when America was moving into a consumerists society. We wanted to be lied to and lured through advertising. The character of Draper is the microcosmos of that national feeling at the time.

Hes a man who has a secret identity. Is Don Draper his secret identity or is it Dick Whitman. Since he identifies with Draper and views Whitman as a different life Id say Whitman is his secret identity and Draper is who he really is.

What better occupation and setting for this man than advertising where the curtains are always drawn to hid the man (hint-his name is Draper, get it?)

Everything Draper does with his Barbie doll wife Betty is about living a life that isn't real but real enough to Draper. I think hes one of the more interesting characters Ive ever met.",1470441600,,1656,4.608843537414966

3252913,5,B000YABIQ6,"What's great about ""Mad Men"" is that it doesn't indulge in the usual cliches about the 1960s. All the characters are depicted as living only in the moment and oblivious to how history will later view that era. Yes, we have the obligatory mentions of JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King, et al, but there is no dramatic underlining of these figures, no breathless nostalgia for how people looked and acted.  This is a refreshing change from shows that are set in the past but are too self-conscious about it (think ""That 70s Show"", or ""Happy Days"").

""Mad Men"" is more than a history lesson and an excuse to trot out vintage pillbox hats and white gloves. I think this is because creator Matthew Weiner is a member of Gen X, that often maligned offspring of famously narcissistic and self-congratulatory Baby Boomers, rather than the retro-loving, surface-is-all hipster crowd who think clothing and protests (whatever they're for) are what made the 60s cool.

In addition to great characterization, dialogue, plot, etc, it shows how people of that era really acted toward one another with unblinking honesty: no one here apologizes for having racist, sexist or anti-Semitic thoughts. They will do Al Jolson in blackface, insult Japanese or Jewish businessmen, pull up women's skirts and call them ""honey"" and ""sweetheart"" and think nothing of it. That honesty in itself is revolutionary, and serves as a frequent wake up call to anyone yearning to idealize that era.  No, this is America in all its ugliness, even at the height of its money and power.",1465948800,,1544,4.904214559386973

3253054,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men will hook you! It is a great drama series. What makes it so?
Writing-Director and Writer Matthew Weiner has written smart scripts which remind this reviewer of the prose encountered in a good novel!
Acting-Headed by the outstanding Jon Hamm who plays the tormented ad man Don Draper the series sparkles with acting from each of the featured actors. These actors give their roles depth and make you care about what happens to them.
Costumes and Sets-Evoke the period of the late 1950s and early 1960's in beautiful pastel colors. The period detail is astounding! Evocative of the palettes drawn in his motion pictures by Alfred Hitchcock and his talented team.
Plot-Sterling Cooper and its ad men and support staff show us how an ad agency worked in the days of male chauvinistic behavior in the office; constant cigarette smoking and the crass sexism and racism of this earlier era in American history.

3253089,1,B000YABIQ6,"I'm in awe how this tv series gets all this love and attention
It's dry stiff and maybe the biggest tv Hype jobs in the last 20 years
I tried to watch it from the beginning (Got through 3 episodes good Lord it was kinda like masterbating with a cheese grater. Slightly amusing, but mostly painful) The only redeeming quality  is the production  (The detail to the time era is  amazing and very stunning
But, that's it
This tv series proves deep down anyone who ""claims"" they are a uber fan of this are closeted Hipsters
Most people say they love it to look cool so the people around you can go wow ooh and ah!
Give me a  break Please
Jon Hamm lives up to his name sake (He's a one trick pony of a actor there are so many Great actors that deserve Respect and awards) But, this smock gets one of the lamest ducks ever But, somehow comes out on top! Crazy Jon Hamm is proof you can make a deal with the devil
Cause there is Nothing special about him (The Shows is done and over) you'll never see him get all the attention and phony praise again
the writing is there I openly admit I couldn't get into it (It's so bloody slow it's like watching paint dry)
I never claimed to be brilliant or the smartest guy in the room  (But, I love History and know quit a bit for someone my age) And if i can't get into this how can people in there 20's ???? Really
It's won the awards it has Cause let's be honest AMC did some under the table old school payola  (and payed the academy off)
AMC payed off various award shows just for bragging rights
That way AMC can add that  it in there tv spots
I can appreciate a slow burn  when telling a story
This ain't the BBC's Downtown Abby
I get and understand why Breaking Bad was awesome and that got dismal ratings number
I just wish more  people gushing over this series were Honest about it
But, why would i expect anyone online to be real and honest",1438128000,,1882,4.134246575342465

Anyone who rates this show less than 4-5 stars is probably a high school drop out. The main reason to watch this show is not the soap opera drama or the chain smoking of cigarettes. It's the way these Advertising people changed 1960s culture. In one episode Pete Campbell starts to notice that the African American market are the only people purchasing Admiral TVs. When he starts to research this and write campaigns to target this marketing group, he is raked over the coals by his racist, pig headed bosses. This is just one example of genius writing of Mad Men.

There is so much smoking that I have to get up and leave the room for a breath of fresh air....but then in the 60's, my mom always had a cigarette going.

It will keep your interest...for the most part. But Weiner engages in gross exaggeration at various times, trying -- it seems -- to destroy the notion that anything good happened in the 1960s!  In other words, he goes WAY overboard.  Just a couple of examples:

Quick, answer this question: How many American adults smoked in the 1960s?  Especially if you have watched MM, what is your answer?  90%?  80%?  75%?  65%?  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  According to the CDC (and they, if anything, are incentivized to be on the high end) the HIGHEST % of smokers in this country was in 1955, and it peaked at about 45% !!  And it trended downward from there.  And by 1960, 1961, etc., when are the beginning years for MM, the actual percentage is lower, around 42% !  But on this show, EVERYONE smokes, and they do it all the time!  The priest, secretaries at their desks, doctors, ALL the big wigs!  I would say that the smoking rate is portrayed at around 80-95% !!  So why does Weiner do this?  Does he not know the actual smoking rates?  Does he really think that executives would allow secretaries to smoke while typing so ash would get all over the paper??  Not sure if Weiner was not around in the 60s (I was raised then), but he is way off.  My dad smoked, and many (I would say less than half) of his male friends did....but it was extremely rare to hear of or see a wife smoking in those circles.  That was considered very ""unladylike.""  But not on Mad Men!  He is simply way, way off here...and it looks like he's either preaching to destroy the 60s or simply ignorant.

Second, on a family picnic, Don and Betts just leave ALL their garbage on the grass, and the show makes a point of having Don throw his beer can on the grass!!  This is absurd.  Again, the Drapers are upper end people, and it would have been considered the epitome of poor taste to be dirty and trashy like that.  That was for people who didn't know better.  Hell, military guys often destroyed cigarettes and put their clipped fingernails in their pockets in the learned zeal to police everything!  Did Americans litter more in the 1960s?  Probably?  But people like the Drapers would not have--not because they were all that concerned about the environment, but because it was so ""lower class"" to be pigs.

Weiner writes more like he has HEARD about the 60s more than actually lived them.  Or, if he did, he exaggerated all of the decade's traits to become a preacher.  So the writing is not NEARLY as good as Breaking Bad, but it is decent.",1427068800,,2691,4.49896480331263

3253441,5,B000YABIQ6,"There are few things seemingly more painful than watching the first episode of Mad Men for the first time. The show ""starts,"" you're introduced to some characters, some vague plot lines that are bound to never ever resolve themselves, and then 45 minutes later it ends.

If you're anything like me, that's the point when you'll stop watching. Sure the costumes were cool, but good god clearly nothing is going to happen, and they just put Dawson's Creek on Prime. I'll show myself to the door.

But then, some time will pass--it could be any amount of time; a couple days, a week, a month--you'll be bored and alone again, and you'll think that maybe you should give Mad Men another shot. And that's how they'll hook you. The second episode has a way of luring you into this deep, waking sleep state, where the edges of your surroundings dull and fade, and you start to forget who you are and all of the aspects of your personality that make you even remotely interesting. And the next thing you know, you're on season 5, and you're getting kind of sick of it.

This show has a way of sucking you in. The costumes are fantastic, the sets are fantastic, the acting is well above average, and the characters are, for the most part, very well developed. The plot sort of gets lost in the shuffle. But, maybe that's not as important as we tend to think it has to be. I've enjoyed this show despite all of the reasons I would think that I would hate it.",1422576000,,1448,4.415730337078652

3253447,2,B000YABIQ6,"I bought this series purely on the large number of effusively enthusiastic reviews here.
Somehow it seems I must now ponder as to why I was so easily mislead?

First up I will admit I haven't seen all of it.
I bought Series One through to Six, ...but I believe there is a seventh series being released in two parts?
(Another shameless money grab?)

I'm now nearly three episodes into Series Four, and quite frankly I've had enough.
It is rare for me to abandon something I have so much time invested in, and I have sat through many movies etc. with the ever optimistic thought that it will/must get better. (More than a few ultimate disappointments there too!)

I did keep thinking that anytime now something really engrossing will happen, even just on the odds that writers must eventually think of something gripping, but....nope!
I was reminded of ""The Borgias"", except without all their lovable qualities and their interesting plots, not to mention the better cocktails?

What about a bomb in the water-cooler? Some group same-sex orgy action in the stationery cupboard? Not even a small paper-jamb in the office copier? Or maybe a typist could get a nasty paper cut and we could see a little blood? ......No?

The one outstanding feature that has probably caused me to persist even this far is without doubt the superb art direction.
The wardrobe, the sets, set dressings are all truly wonderful.
The attention to period detail just amazing. FIVE full stars for that aspect!

That having been said,...and I think I have watched enough of this series now not to be accused of not giving the show a fair hearing, but in lieu of any conventional review, I'll just list a series of pertinent questions.
The answers to which others who have ventured, ...enjoyed (endured?) further may like to enlighten me with.

A/ Does anything, anything at all of significance EVER happen in the plot? Ever?

B/ Do the writers ever introduce a character, however marginal, that you might actually care enough about, (or even hate enough would do) to want to see what happens to them? Or are they all useless, vapid and self-obsessed alcoholics right down to the very last man and ""sex-object"" woman?

C/ Is everybody represented in the series such a self-congratulatory total tosser that you really just want to dose their coffee with liberal amounts of thallium rather than watch them back-slap themselves for even one moment longer? (That thought did occur to me! Quite early on too!)

I began to suspect it was one of those snuff-series where you are presented with a cast of really un-likables, all held together by some means and then you enjoy watching as someone, or something, takes them out one by deserving one. It's always great fun deciding who will be the next victim, ...but that didn't happen either.
Hell I'd have killed them all,....and willingly!

D/ Is the very last Season set in some vast Oncology Ward to which the entire cast have been admitted, all with smoking/alcohol related diseases?
I felt like my own lungs were in danger just from watching the billowing clouds! Every actor must have developed at least a 10-pack-a-day habit during the making! The producers are surely in for a few law suits?

Look, I understand there seem to be a lot of maybe-masochists with FAR more endurance skills than I obviously possess, and who like to think there is something really deep-&-meaningful being presented, but I don't watch fictional shows for their deep social realism so much as primarily for entertainment, and this for me fell far short.
I wasn't wanting ""Happy Families"", but I did expect maybe intrigue, backstabbing or even some ruthless jockeying for top position.

Truly I began to increasingly disengage. I just didn't care what happened to any of the useless pack of wannabees, and that always spells the end of things for me.
But as I said perhaps just into Series Four was too early to bail?
That's more than half way through, so how long were the writers planning to hold off?

However I do note with interest a few dissenting voices here in the reviews. Quite a few give even less stars than I'm willing to award, so I may not be the only one somewhat less than captivated with ""Mad Men"", but feel free to agree or disagree.

(I await virulent and personally derisive comment from some guy here on Amazon for whom ANY perceived criticism of this particular show hits his all-too exposed Achilles heel...you'll no doubt recognise him when he shows up! Which he will.)

In short I'd say the potential and possibilities were all there in bucket-loads, but so little was ever exploited by the writing.
Well at least up until where I left off anyway.

This show would be really great for those who tend to doze off occasionally in front of TV, or have to get up to visit the toilet, check on the kids, make the tea or even miss an episode or so for some reason. You'll have no trouble at all picking up where you left off, because the plot will be no further advanced than when you left.",1420502400,4,5004,4.7070938215102975

I'd say the show is highly entertaining and a window into a world that many remember, and others only have heard about.  From the characters, to plot, to music, to authentic background scenes the show is 5 Stars all the way.

What would it be like to be at the top of the advertising world?  This series has tapped into a sub-culture or popular culture that people take for granted.  The show has single-handedly revived an interest in the ""Mad Men"" era and boosted the book sales of marketing legends like David Ogilvy, whose books are not to be missed, whether bought or borrowed from libraries.",1418515200,,662,4.529411764705882

3253693,5,B000YABIQ6,"I just recently ""got into"" Mad Men and purchased the first 3 seasons on Blu-ray. Thus far, as I leisurely work my way through Season 1 I have just 3 words to say: I love it! If you're old and gray or feel that way (as I sometimes do mainly because I'm getting old and gray) Mad Men might just be the thing to perk you right up and rekindle thoughts of bygone days and simpler times. Its weird, wild, and wonderful all at once  in its way a fanciful window showing life as it once was in so many ways. In other ways  well, now I don't want to spoil anything!

This I will honestly say: For my nickel, Mad Men is quite possibly one of the greatest things to come along in many years. I would almost say it just might be the Twin Peaks of its age. Though set (for starters) more than 50 years ago in March, 1960, Mad Men is that fresh, that funky  that much pure fun to watch. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a good period drama.",1403481600,,932,3.9946236559139785
3253694,5,B000YABIQ6,"I was a boy in the early 60's. It was when  men wore coat and tie when they dined out.
Children were expected to say, "":Yes sir or Yes ma'am"" when speaking to adults. Cars were big, heavy and chromed to the max.
Madmen reminds me of that era.  We had our problems and failings....but nothing like the lunacy of today.
Dads worked. Moms usually stayed home and took care of things.  One paycheck was enough for everything...mortgage, car payments, groceries, etc...

3253745,5,B000YABIQ6,"Overall this is a great series.  The plot lines are amazing and as historically accurate that Hollywood will allow them to be.  The acting is fantastic.  This is one of the best Dramas that I have seen in a VERY LONG TIME.
This first season takes place in about 1960 where the best thing a woman could hope for was senior secretary in the career world of business.  It shows how the main characters, all of which are seriously in need of massive amounts of therapy, deal with their own problems.  Don Draper, the creative head of an advertising agency, is a cheating drunk who has a great amount of talent.  Joan, the senior secretary, is a classic gorgeous female whose biggest hope is land a rich husband, but doesn't realize that she secretly feels empty and desires more out of life.  Peggy Olsen starts out as Don's secretary, but because the office drunk, Freddy, gives credit where credit is due, gets a chance to become more than just a secretary.  Don takes Peggy under his wing because he sees a part of himself in Peggy, ambition and talent with the desire to go outside the traditional roles that society had set for women at that time.  Pete Campbell is the office jerk who has an on-again-off-again relationship with Peggy.  As for the rest of the characters, they are each either unless or screwed up or both as they can be and they try to deal with all of that while navigating the trials and tribulations of adulthood.  Some of things that happen to those characters are interesting, some are funny, and a few are just somewhat weird.
I highly recommend this series to adults who love good dramas, but the underlying subject matter and a few of the basic themes are not suitable for children.",1399939200,,1709,4.552287581699346

3253747,2,B000YABIQ6,"As an admirer and fan of advertising (yes, there's lots of bad stuff that gets out) I'm very disappointed in several different aspects of MADMEN based on my viewing of episode 1.  Watching another episode would be like eating some stinky vegetable I don't like.

First, the dialogue and acting seem very, very contrived, drawn too sharply to feel realistic.  The hints at conflict and complexity in the creative director central character seem like afterthoughts unconnected to any event or storyline in the episode or, future episodes.  The characters, main and minor are overdrawn superficially, from the aspiring twit hot to displace the creative director to the sneering, smoking gynecologist the young woman goes to.

Second, I got the mens' boorish deprecation of women the first time it was offered and found the heavyhanded repetition of this meme over and over and over throughout this episode displaced opportunity to develop more engaging and interesting content -- e.g., deeper details about the creative director's implied internal conflicts or adding some dimensionality to the totally flat character of the young woman employee who has just joined the agency's support staff.  Her co-worker women are portrayed as petty and vindictive with each other in 100% of these vignettes. She seems to have been thrown into a pool of piranha.

Third, the visuals -- sets, setting details, costumes, cinematography -- of this are third rate at best and rarely reach the lower rungs of mediocre.  The scope of the sets is too narrow:  they don't show enough to create an inner sense, feeling of the space, the physical ambience in which the plot (was there a plot?) and characters evolve.  The cheap setting details are incongruent with the economic and influence position of an ad agency as well positioned as this one supposedly is  -- more stereotyping going on even in these visual details.

I'll stop here: no point in boring myself further by thinking about this pitiful parade of visual and social stereotypes.  Now I'm not even sure I can justify the two stars I gave this when I started writing this review.",1399420800,,2119,5.02

  We started watching this series, we'd heard so many stellar reviews about Mad Men that we were excited to get started. We watched the first episode and right away there was the casual sexual harassment of the female employees and the complete disdain that the men at the ad agency had for their wives, on whom they cheated with with a gleeful locker-room mentality that was just all hardy-har-har-ain't-we-bad-boys. The men were horrible to each other and back stabbings were the order of the day. The wives were catty and cruel, as were the ""girls"" in the secretarial pool.
  There is no character, not one single character, in this series who is sympathetic or likeable or interesting. They're all awful, every last one of them. No one is a true friend. No one is kind. No one seems to have a single worn thread of humanity in them.

They do this in episode after episode and we actually watched several to see if there was a real story that was going somewhere.  Maybe so, but there are no signs of it.  There are no characters - and no values - to be admired or enjoyed - just a Hollywood clich view of the man in the gray flannel suit living an ugly life with lots of money - the sort of people who would put together this kind of surrealistic ""entertainment"" for the ""masses"".

3253827,4,B000YABIQ6,"I was looking forward to a period piece set in the late 50s and 60s. With the exception of Pam Am which only ran for 1 season (I can see why), the pickings are lean for this period. After all, much more was happening in the late 60s and 70s, so why take the risk? Well done, AMC!

On the surface, it starts off captivating. The sets, costumes and misogynistic mindsets, are spot on. Sure there were a few bloopers : pantyhose was only launched in 1959 and I doubt that mousy Peggy Olsen would have been a trailblazer, in spite of showing backbone and ambition in subsequent series. There are more, if you are really looking.  Rather sit back and enjoy the series - there is so much accurate attention to detail that the odd blunder can be overlooked.

On the surface, it appears to degenerate into just another soapie, but looking deeper, there is a subtlety of character development that is easily missed. The undercurrents in the dialog and lifestyle require your attention. I have often rewound a scene to ensure that I grasped the innuendo.

Season 1's compulsion to have constant smoke filled sets coupled with unlimited drinking borders on subliminal propaganda. It is not realistic and I found it distracting to the point that the rest of what went on became secondary at times. Sure, people smoked and drank a lot in those days, but not everyone, all the time, otherwise they would be too plastered by lunch time time to get any work done. Fortunately this gets toned down in future seasons.

I am currently on Season 3 and still enjoying it. So far, there have been lapses where it languishes in the doldrums for an episode or 3, but overall, it is a refreshing change. Another plus is watching it 7 years after it launched is not a problem - it will never date.",1391904000,,1771,4.521875

3253865,5,B000YABIQ6,"For some reason, I thought this was a comedy series; there are indeed many comedic moments, but this is most definitely a character-based drama. The Madison Avenue Men - Mad Men - inhabit the era of the early 1960's in New York - when drinking, smoking and womanizing defined the advertising industry in New York City. The women in the office are pretty, young things, all secretaries or switch board operators, just making a buck until they find a husband. The Mad Men ogle the office girls, make patronizing comments, call them ""sweetheart"", and generally relegate them to second-class citizen, sex-object status. Though I began my career in the early 1970's, 10 years after Betty Friedan wrote ""The Feminine Mystique"", the aura of workplace discrimination was all too familiar. The costumes and hairstyles may have changed quite a bit over that decade, but the sentiments were largely intact.

Don Draper, a drop dead handsome and suave smooth operator, with an obscure past heads the creative department, and the junior members of the department fear and revere him. He is an enigma, charismatic and appealing, but no one really knows him, least of all his beautiful former-model, perfect wife, Betty, an icy refined blond with an impeccable background. His back-story is revealed in small vignettes throughout the series, and we gradually come to know about his troubled past. Similarly, other characters that seem mono-chromatic at first, are made more multi-dimensional as each episode unfolds. It is this slow progression of revelations, peeled back like the layers of an onion, that make this series so addictive. Nothing is as it seems at first; the world is infinitely more complicated than it seems at first, even in 1960; happiness and security are elusive - even for the Mad Men.

The sets, both in the office and home, are perfectly detailed for the era, down to the same frosted cocktail glasses that I remember my parents owning. The wardrobe, hair styles and makeup are all flawlessly executed - a step back in time to 1960. I will definitely keep tuning in for subsequent seasons.",1390608000,,2099,4.994285714285715

3253909,5,B000YABIQ6,"The 52 episodes of ""Mad Men"" Seasons 1 Through 4 constitutes a sort of masterpiece in TV mini-series.  What makes it so good are the subject matter, casting, care in creating the early-60s atmosphere, and the unity and consistency that comes from a single person (in this case Matt Weiner) having co-authorship in every episode.  Such a mini-series is to a 2-hour movie as a novel is to a short story.

The main subject is the self-awakening of Dan Draper, the creative head of the concepts department of a Madison Avenue advertising firm.  Dan Draper is played by Jon Hamm, a very good actor with a lot of live-theater experience.  Hamm is a commanding presence, looks the part, and is up to the challenges of this demanding role.  Dan Draper is a talented man functioning brilliantly in his professional career, but he is an alcoholic, a dysfunctional husband (although a reasonably good father), and a compulsive womanizer.  We learn, as he learns, from his mental flashbacks that occur from time to time, that he is a man escaping from a very difficult childhood.  We root for him despite his flaws because he is troubled and displays an innate decency at key moments.  By the end of series 4 he has achieved a certain level of self-awareness, and we the audience have been on an interesting journey.

Personally, I think they should have stopped with series 4, but that's a different story.

The rest of the ensemble cast is generally excellent.  There are many interesting sub-plots.  We follow the rise from secretary to Dan Draper's co-worker of Peggy.  Its a struggle all the way for her in the pre-Feminist world of the early 60s.

I have the Blu-ray versions of seasons 1 through 4, which I purchased individual.  Each season is 13 episodes spread across 3 Blu-ray discs.  The picture quality and sound quality are fine.

3253911,5,B000YABIQ6,"I always feel like I was born too late.  After watching the first episode of Mad Men, Season One -- I think it's confirmed.  Drinking in the office from 9am on?  People smoking indoors with no regard for common decency?  Sexually harassing one's secretary, and it just being considered commonplace to cheat on one's wife?  Don Draper doesn't bat an eyelash at these things, and moves through life as if a psychopath only concerned with his own well-being.  I also liked how his wife didn't ask any questions when he told her that he decided to ""Stay in the city"" the last couple nights, without even so much as a phone call.  There is zero expectation that he will contribute to caring for his child also.  Needless to say if I attempted any of these things, my wife would have me drawn and quartered.  Living vicariously through Don Draper in this show is now going to be one of the few pleasures I have in my sad life as a neutered American male -- living in the culture that we have created for ourselves, like a self-made cage.  In Draper's time, men were men indeed.",1388102400,,1071,4.446153846153846

3253990,5,B000YABIQ6,"""Mad Men Season 1"" caught my attention because of my fascination with the public relations world and the story being based on the career symbolism of advertising (which is indirectly related to public relations).  I unexpectedly learned the various ways that media and other various outlets can have subtle influence.  It was also important for me to watch the first season in order to help me further understand the other seasons of Mad Men that I intend to watch. The following are some of the various facets of the season 1 that piqued my interest and made the characters relatable and series worthwhile to watch:
The characters of Don Draper, Betty Draper, and Rachel Menken have all experienced what it feels like to lose their mothers to physical death. Additionally, the character of Don Draper had to secretly carry the societal stigma of his late biological mother being a prostitute. I also liked how Betty Draper was portrayed as a dynamic woman who adores both her children and husband but yearns for a life of her own outside the home. I feel that this portrayal is realistic due to my own personal experiences of observing my late adoptive mother until I was 18 years old. She dearly loved my siblings and me as well as my adoptive father. However, I frequently noticed that her face lit up more during the time periods in her life when she had to get ready for work.
Watching the characters of Joan Holloway giving career advice to Peggy Olson made gave the series a great touch because both women were carefully navigating their professional lives while dealing with workplace sexual harassment. The Progressive Car Insurance lady (Stephanie Courtney) and Darby Stanchfield (from the TV series Scandal) also make appearances during Mad Men season 1.
The following pop culture references are among those mentioned in Mad Mean season 1: Lady Chatterley, Sara Lee cake, Atlas Shrugged, Mad magazine, Rosetta Stone, and Clearasil.
Mad Men Season 1 is a fascinating series to watch for those who are either interested in American culture from the 1960's, enjoy watching drama series, and/or those curious about the world of advertising.",1382140800,,2147,4.944598337950138

It got me hooked and I had a hard time finding time to watch all the newer seasons since I was 6 seasons behind and the episodes are about 47 minutes and there is about 13 episodes per season.,1380844800,,273,3.963636363636364
3253993,5,B000YABIQ6,"Setting in the late 50's and early 60's when I grew up, it is so real to that time about the ad men of Madison Ave. So real on how women were treated in the work place and the lack of respect. It is such good dirt and who isn't in love with Don Draper?!!
Should have won the Emmy's in all categories. Thank you for prompt mailing.",1380585600,,330,3.8676470588235294
3253994,3,B000YABIQ6,"Madmen Season One is fun, mainly on a stylistic level.  I love the opening credits sequence. The series is an almost-faithful recreation of the visual style and culture of the early 1960s.

I say almost-faithful because the inaccuracies can be a little jarring.  I lived through the 60s and remember the decade clearly. The errors are a little irritating, and were bad enough to keep taking me out of the reality of the storyline.

The timeline is a little loopy.  It's 1960, then it seems to be years later, in terms of what's going on culturally in the U.S., then it's 1960 again.  They really needed a consultant who lived through the decade, connect the dots of what happened when and what caused what to happen, because the first season at least was a mishmash with some things out of order.  And they were important things.  It's as if someone were making a movie about the first decade of the 21st century, and set the events of 9-11 after, not before, the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, or showed Obama elected before George Bush, or showed texting preceding email.

Beatniks were not hippies.  The first season was set in 1960, before Kennedy's election, and shows the main character meeting a bunch of beatniks, but most of them are portrayed as hippies, not beatniks.  But hippies of the type portayed were a reaction to the Vietnam war and the Kennedy assassination, which did not occur, obviously, before Kennedy was elected to office. Nixon lost partly because he didn't listen to admen.  Marshall McLuhan published ""The media is the message"" in the mid 60s, so people would not be talking about it years earlier. The visual style of the ads the admen are creating, is more reminiscent of the mid 50s than the 60s.  The problem is that ""one thing leads to another,"" so getting the order wrong makes the show lose its sense of reality on a certain level.  The producers went to such trouble to get some things right, the things they got wrong are a little jarring.",1379721600,3,1981,4.655172413793103

3254031,5,B000YABIQ6,"I remember when this show started. I heard such amazing things about it. I went to find it on my TV - no luck. I didn't get AMC on my satellite package. Darn! I had to live with all of the buzz swirling around me. Thank heavens for my Entertainment Weekly or I wouldn't even know the basics.

Now I have been given the opportunity to see the very first season of Mad Men and I can say I now understand what all that fuss was about. I can't say that I fell in love from the very first episode - boy that Don Draper can be a louse! But then the show grew on me as I watched. It's complicated, very, very complicated. And I like that. Hard to believe that women were treated that way, eh? So glad I came of age in a slightly later time.

The acting is so smooth I got caught up in the show and at times was quite lost in what was going on. I love when that happens; it's much rarer with television than it is with a book for me and quite a surprise when it does happen. I loved how each episode ended with a little shock to the system so that you were left quite anxious for the next one to begin.

3254036,5,B000YABIQ6,"I only learned of this show at the beginning of the 6th season and enjoyed it so much my wife and I ordered the 1st season to catch up. This show reminds us of how the word 'class' got its name. The writers have created stories that leave you fully engaged, and have reminded us of things we take for granted. Take for instance the introduction of going to work dressed to impress! And how about the time when people used electric typewriters! I never heard of John Hamm before, but I'm sure we'll be seeing and hearing much more of him.

He plays the part of a man with a plan to the hilt. The trouble is, he has a past he is running away from, and as he states in an episode with someone from his past, ""There's only one direction my life is moving, and that's forward."" The show also reminds us of the introduction of popular ads we now view as commonplace. There's Lucky Strikes, coffee brands, women's clothing. They've obviously done their research because I feel renewed pride in my work from watching how this show reflects we all have an important role in what we do, only sometimes need to be reminded. This show not only entertains you, but for me has reminded me where I've been and where I am now, and what's more, I can be proud of who I am.

There are alot of good qualities to the show - the acting is above average, the setting and costumes. I find one or 2 of the characters interesting in an odd way (Draper and Campbell) but for the most part the characters are pretty stereotypical of what I would have expected to find in the 60s era soap opera. T I will admit episode 12 with all the masturbatory references was a hoot. I was getting interested in the subplot with Don's mysterious past but they've already put that to bed. Maybe it'll come back but the mystery is gone.

I guess I was hoping to be hooked like everyone else. But overall, I find there to be too little action and a repetition of the same plot points from episode to episode.",1374537600,,825,4.427631578947368

3254211,3,B000YABIQ6,"Having heard people talking about Mad Men, I finally broke down and ordered Season 1 on Amazon. Watched a few episodes every week. First off, be prepared for a look at 1960 that is very reflexive, meaning it distills the worst of the era into bits so repetitive that it becomes annoying. Everyone smokes in every scene (almost). Same for the drinking. Same for the racism, misogyny, and other characteristics. Certainly these evils existed, but to hit them with a sledgehammer every time distracts from the storyline. That said, there are many redeeming qualities of this show. Don Draper is an ad exec facing his own demons and an upstart exec. Don's wife and her girlfriends live in the homemaker life, casting a wary eye on a divorce neighbor. And the plot spins on from there: big money at stake, promotions, personal relationships, betrayal and more. I look forward to following the next season to see where this goes and will post another review for Season 2 separately.

3254272,3,B000YABIQ6,"I've watched just about the whole series on Netflix. It's interesting only for its nostalgic value (because I hail from that period and have worked on Madison Avenue) but oddly it doesn't cause nostalgia in me because there's a modern, contemporary element in the series, in all the characters and in the various episodes (and it has a billion and a half directors for each episode), that sours it. I've reached Season 4, episode 13, and was not surprised to see the anti-cigarette ploy. I don't particularly like the character of Don Draper aka Dick Whitman; he doesn't seem to have a self because of his dishonesty in stealing Whitman's identity in Korea. He's too angst-ridden and has a continuing series of problems that seem pretty banal. You really don't know why he has all the sex he does (and he has almost as many women as he has cigarettes and bourbons and whiskeys, practically nonstop) and it's never explained why he needs sex so much.

Jon Hamm would be a great Hank Rearden, the industrialist, in a remake of Atlas Shrugged, if the people in charge of casting for that disaster had any marbles. But as Don Draper, he's just literally a selfless entity in search of a self. As a slice of lavishly produced Naturalism, the series is marvelously cast and otherwise well done. It doesn't hold a candle, however, to movies that deal with internal conflicts such as ""Leave Her to Heaven."" One thing I do miss and which the series recreates is the women's clothing styles, which were sexier.",1367452800,,1500,4.7034220532319395

3254276,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men caught my eye as soon as I read that it was set in the 1960's.  Ah, the 1960's. I was 10 in 1960; graduated from high school in 1968.  Watching this television show brings back not only my childhood, but my teenage years as well.  Everything from Selectric typewriters, to switchboards, phones with blinking buttons, eating raw hamburger, and living with parents that smoked and drank as a normal part of life. Add to that list driving drunk, driving without seat belts, kids playing with plastic bags over their head, pregnant women drinking and smoking, and other shocking behavior to curl our toes.

Set in New York City in the heyday of advertising agencies in Manhattan, it's an eclectic weave of husbands, housewives, mistresses, secretaries, office politics, and account executives.  It reminds me of those days when anything went.  Men made sexual innuendos to the female office staff, booze was in the offices, and everyone smoked like a chimney. My first time someone flirted with me at my second job in 1969, the bank manager came up and told me I had ""great legs.""  Then in 1972 my boss had me stay late one night and came up behind me and grabbed my breasts.  Wow, I could have sued had that happened today.

On top of the outlandish days of sexual harassment in the office, it's mixed with the occurrence of segregation where Negros couldn't ride in the elevators with the working staff unless given permission.  Everyone in the company was white - no mixing of the races like our modern offices today.  Jewish people were treated like aliens that couldn't be understood.  Everyone drank and smoked.  I can remember my first boss in 1968 having a bottle of booze stashed in his desk drawer.  Most of the day he smelled of alcohol.

Then there were the women who stayed home - the housewives.  Always with their hair in place, their bouncy little dresses, their kids clean, their houses spotless, and dinner waiting on the table when their husbands came home.  They knew their place, and they kept their place whether they were miserable or happy. It was their way of life, along with eating prime rib and butter for dinner.  The men, of course, lived doubled lives of carousing with other women and having mistresses on the side in or out of the office setting. Married women, who met a divorced woman with two children living alone, was an unthinkable state of affairs.

The characters are wonderful, with their own back story of how their childhood and family has molded them into the adults they have become.  Each have their own personal struggles, whether it be with self-worth, a family they wish to forget, a wife with whom they are estranged, an overbearing mother who filled their daughters with expectations, or a father who doesn't support their son's career choice.  The stories are rich in their own right and filled with everybody's pursuit of happiness in the 60's, in one way or the other. Rather than worrying about their smoking, drinking, or butter on their plates, the Communists are the threats, as well as the thought of having a Catholic president.

I can't tell you how utterly entertaining this show is, at least for me.  If you didn't grow up in that era, you'll probably find it very strange.  If you did, it will be like walking down memory lane, remembering your childhood, and no doubt your parents.  I can still see my mother who wore a dress every day, had dinner on the table, who hadn't worked out of the home since World War II.  Yes, we have evolved in many ways.  Discrimination and sexism in the office is a thing of the past.  Feminism has taken the women out of the homes and made them executives along side men.  However, a part of me misses the simplicity of those days when life had different complications than we face today.

One of my favorites are the girls in the office and how they share the gossip.  A particular scene that had me rolling on the floor happened to be when one lady pulled from her purse the novel, ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" and the women started talking about it.  Of course, it's strictly taboo to read such a book that uses the words no lady would utter and contain such graphic sexual scenes in a book!  One woman asks if she can borrow it to read, and the advice was priceless.  ""Don't read it on the train.  It will attract all the wrong elements.""  What a hoot!  Reminded me of today and women reading Fifty Shades of Grey in public.  Things never really change in some aspects.  We just color it in a different light.

Anyway, highly recommend the show.",1365897600,,4550,4.617683686176837

3254330,2,B000YABIQ6,"I grew up in the sixties and so watching this show is a blast in many ways {My mom dressed like that!  We had a clock like that!  Oh, the awesome black telephone that I'm convinced is still a better piece of equipment than anything you could buy today).  And yes, contrary to what some reviewers think, people DID smoke like that; my childhood was spent in a smoke-filled haze, and the ashtrays were just as gross as we see on the show.  The producers recreate the early 60s in a very believable way.

The acting is good, although the pacing can be a bit slow, but I can live with that as it takes time to plot out a compelling story.  My two main problems with the show are strictly a matter of personal taste:  I cannot get past that there are no truly likeable characters on the show (I need to be able to root for at least one person) and also I do not like its graphic nature - I don't want to see a ""put your knees apart"" gynecological exam complete with speculum thrown in for good measure, Draper pulling up his fly then flushing the toilet, and most emphatically the ad exec who regurgitates in front of his colleagues after walking up multiple flights of stairs.  I was midway through season one when I had to suffer that last gem.  That's just gross, and gratuitous; we could still have gotten the idea of what happened without it literally being pictured out.

3254375,5,B000YABIQ6,"How can I hope to say anything which has not already been said about this AMC series in over 450 reviews. I can only add my personal reactions. I have been avoiding it for several seasons, since I found the relation between men and women quite disturbing, in spite of the fact that I lived through that early '60s era, but in a somewhat lower class family, where my mother worked in a factory and my father in the steel mills. I was also a bit turned off by the time spend in the bedroom rather than the board room. I loved ""The West Wing"" because, among other things, it demonstrated how power was far more exciting than sex, and I thought that the new series ""Suits"" did the same thing. But, after seeing none of my USA, TNT, and TBS series win any awards, and the AMC series raking them in like Hershey Kisses, I thought it was time to give this a try. A nudge from my Facebook friend Esther Schindler didn't hurt.

So, I have discovered that the pace, the dialoge, the characters, and the situations, all framed with superior writing and good acting, really draws me into this world, in spite of its air of testosterone out of control, where the only thing the men want to do with all the women they meet is to get them into the sack. That's an exaggeration, of course, but it happens far more than most other series this side of Californication.

If I had any complaints, it would be that there are very few really satisfying conclusions to the story arcs. One gets the feeling that the big climax will come with the series finale, similar to Josh Lyman and Donna Moss finally hooking up in the next to last episode of ""The West Wing."" Closing deals with clients just doesn't give me a great deal of satisfaction. There are personal crises, but everything is so low key, one is reminded of how empty people's lives seemed to be before the great cultural revolution of 1964. On the bright side, I am positively looking forward to watching the next season to see how things work out.

It's interesting to compare John Hamm with Gabriel Macht of ""Suits"". Both characters are eminantly skilled at their jobs, and comfortable in their own skins. But ""Mad Men's"" Don Draper is understated while ""Suits"" Harvey Specter is arrogant and just a bit blind to his weaknesses.",1361232000,6,2268,4.473429951690822

3254430,4,B000YABIQ6,"I've always hated Mad Men. I never had to spend even five minutes with the show to know I wouldn't like it.

This seems almost paradoxical, seeing as how the show consists of elements that I love and have so longed to see in popular entertainment. From everything I heard, it was a mature, character-driven drama that strips away the sepia-toned nostalgia of a bygone time in America, addressing the racism, sexism and other eyebrow-furrowing quirks of the 1960s.

Not to mention the fact it stars Jon Hamm and Cristina Hendricks, who have both won me over in their own ways. I've never seen much of Hamm's actual work as an actor, but I've witnessed him handsome his way through interviews, and I can't deny his charm is undeniable. And Hendricks? I've been in love with her since I first got a glimpse of her talent in ""Firefly.""

So, by all accounts, it seems like this is something I would instantly fall in love with, if only I would give it the chance, like how I felt in high school every time a girl laughed before saying she had ""other plans"" Friday night.

""But, that's stupid,"" you say out loud to yourself as you read this, ""why would you form an opinion about something you haven't experienced?""

""The same reason I never leave the house and don't trust the young people,"" I respond. ""I'm an old man.""

The reason I had never before given the show a chance was because of my friend, Dalton, who has been obsessed with the show since it first premiered, has pestered me about checking it out since day one, and, just because I knew it would drive him crazy, I've stayed as far away from it as possible.

Well, I finally watched it. And I loved it. And I hate that I loved it

Why? Because now I'm forced to face the fact that Dalton was right all along, and, despite my best efforts, I've been won over.

Watching the first episode of the series, ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"" was a great and painful experience, because I wanted it to fail and I wanted the credits to roll and be able to text him and brag about how much it sucked. But I couldn't. And I hated it.

I hated the incredible performances and deeply-drawn characters that sucked me in and made me care. I hated the well-structured plot that had me anticipating how it would all get resolved. I hated the detailed scenery, I hated the wonderful  costumes, I hated the beautiful framing for the striking visuals.

I hated everything that made me love it, and now I hate myself because I'm looking forward to more.",1360022400,2,2483,4.4449339207048455

This show reminds us that the 1950's-1960's were not the ""good old days"".  Thank God we have gotten more enlightened regarding equality of race and sex and there are more opportunities for both.  I don't remember my mother and her friends being as vacuous as the women here, however, so applaud them.

It's a delight to see how uncannily the era is replicated in attitudes and atmosphere.  The production values, camera shots, lighting and staging are brilliant.  And the actors don't overplay their roles; the timing is impeccable.  Each show is addictive--you can't wait to see what is going to transpire next as the mystery of their lives and relationships starts to reveal itself.

I love watching this on the treadmill as the show is so captivating, time passes quickly.

3254550,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is a story of a man who on the surface has everything but at his core he has nothing and knows it. To speak about the details too much would reveal too much but the great reception of this series should be an indicator for prospective buyers. Years later I still can feel the show. The series has lost its greatness in later seasons but they produced the two best seasons I have seen on television in their first two. Warning: the show is addictive. Four episodes at a time hardly satisfied me. Second warning: I admit to buying martini glasses and drinking midday to this show.

Favorite episodes:

The Hobo Code
The Wheel

Peggy's story arc was particularly great. My favorite moment, if you could call it that, was when she was recording the audio for the ad campaign in the wheel. Just watch it and you will understand. I still can remember how it made me feel even years later.",1355702400,,887,4.429447852760736

3254554,5,B000YABIQ6,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones as Don's wife), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 1. There are four more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

The writing had a huge amount of attention to detail (note Don's ""Carousel"" pitch), the writers and actors had more freedom to develop their characters because they were starting with a blank slate, and the story line was more tightly focused than it was in subsequent seasons. Also, because of directions that writers took in subsequent years, this season had the characters at their most likeable. While that may be unrealistic, and Mad Men is, after all, striving for faux-realism, it made for more compelling viewing and we not only wanted to watch the characters, we wanted them to be happy.

The sets are gorgeous, the fashion is intriguing, and the plots make sense. This was Mad Men at its peak.",1350172800,,748,4.753846153846154
3254592,4,B000YABIQ6,"I got this for my Girlfriend because she was instantly hooked. I however, was not. While I think the set's are great (most of the show is on sets I assume because it would be too costly to make the outside world look like 1960) the costumes sharp, the acting superb and the cinematography is better than most shows, I am not compelled by the melodrama of the characters. I think if you stripped away the charm of the '60's and made this a contemporary show, it would be like Desperate Housewives. The stories and arch of the characters really aren't that important, mainly trivial except to the characters themselves. This is not a bad show, it's better than most other shows on tv. I just don't think it's as amazing as other shows. I think shows like Breaking Bad and The Wire do/did a better job of making melodrama seem more important and less trivial by weaving them together better and over a more grand arch. On Blu-Ray this show looks immaculate. Detail is sharp and crisp, black levels are deep, and colors are vibrant and pop onscreen. If you like AMC shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad or more dramatic shows like Game Of Thrones or The Wire, then I think you'll like this show too, but you'll also realize that those shows do a better job of making melodrama compelling and more interesting. Hopefully further seasons of the show flesh out more interesting and compelling stories that are a bit more entertaining.

3254642,3,B000YABIQ6,"After having heard a lot of hype about how great Mad Men was, I decided I'd give the show a try--right from the beginning, which is generally where I like to start things.

I finished the first season last night, and I find myself in a position of neither loving or hating the show. Just a feeling of supreme ambivalence, and a healthy dose of disappointment. What can I say? The acting is solid, the wardrobes are gorgeous and so are the elaborate sets. Mad Men exudes an aura of the sixties, completely with music and the omnipresent haze of cigarette smoke.

Unfortunately, once you get beyond the pretty packaging, there's not much there. The characters seem to be vying with each other for how unsympathetic they can become, and many of the plot lines(particularly those involving the main character, Don Draper) just don't hold together. I had expected the advertising world to provide much of the drama, but the show hops and skips from one client to the next, often with no resolution.

Another issue is timeline--there is no coherent sense of time or exactly what's going on. Sometimes an episode covers a single day. . .and then the next episode picks up six months later, and you learn that the affair which was ""never going to happen"" in that episode, has been going on for the entire six months. It's very jarring.

I might give the show one more try with Season 2, but not for a while. Too many good shows on my list at the moment.",1344988800,,1445,4.546153846153846

3254686,5,B000YABIQ6,"MAD MEN is currently moving into its sixth season, and it's unlikely that you haven't heard of it by now. I managed to go this long without watching a single episode or learning a single thing about any of its characters or events. I had, of course, heard of the rave reviews, but the concept (the lives and times of advertising executives in Manhattan) didn't really interest me. Also, I'm generally of the sort that if something has massively wide appeal (see: Twilight), then I'm probably not going to like it. I'm not an elitist; I just find that wildly popular entertainment has usually been dumbed down to have broader draw.

At the insistence of friends and family, I finally sat down to watch the first season of this much-lauded show, and -- I won't lie -- I immediately hated it. The characters are pretty much all despicable. The men are obnoxious adulterers. The women are either hollow, petulant shells or obvious caricatures of sexuality for the men to gape and paw at. Right off the bat, the central character -- a charismatic and mysterious advertising executive named Don Draper -- falls madly in love with a rich Jewess he has just met. ""What the?"" I said. ""Has he met her before?"" By the third episode, I was ready to call it quits.

I'm so glad I didn't.

It is easy to get tied up in concepts like story and entertainment, but it is so rare to find subtlety, depth, and brilliance in primetime television that I have often stopped looking for them. The more I watched this show, though, the more I realized that there was a true craft at work. Not only is every element ingeniously placed and crafted -- from the soundtrack, costumes, backdrops, asides, cultural references, and glances -- but it is done so in such a way that, even if you aren't aware of them, you can't help but appreciate them. What a joy to finally find a work of art -- and, yes, this show is certainly a work of art -- that actively finagles its way into your braincells. You can focus on superficialities such as whose doing what (or whom) and where the plot is headed, but you will soon find yourself (if even subconsciously) noting how perfectly those larger elements mesh with the show's less overt environment.

I was initially distracted by the truly selfish, lazy, and loathsome attitudes of the show's main characters, but I see now that they are representations of American culture as it was, wants to be, and even is today. The show's themes -- success, happiness, love, hope, and commercialism -- are never pounded into the scripts or set pieces, and yet they are so achingly resonant that I ended each episode with a tingle in my neck and an immediate desire to watch it again. It is nearly impossible to watch one without feeling as if there were parts -- important or not -- that slipped your notice or that you would love to go back and fully learn how to relish. Everything from the acting, dialogue, and subject matter ties together in a way that, well, that I don't know if I've ever seen on TV before.

Watch it. If you're like me, and you're holding out, you've no reason to. Seriously. Watch it. Then watch it again. It really is that good.",1343779200,4,3155,4.537785588752197

3254693,5,B000YABIQ6,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The first season of ""Mad Men,"" American Movie Classics' original flagship drama, beautifully lays out the involved dramatic satire in its thirteen episodes.  Featuring one of the most versatile ensemble casts on television, the show is remarkable for providing genuine entertainment while also providing very thoughtful material for the intellect.

Centering on the fictitious ad agency Sterling Cooper and its charmingly egotistical top creative mind Don Draper(Jon Hamm in an iconic performance), the show satirizes the image of clean early 1960's America by highlighting masculine sexual dominance in the office and strongly patriarchal gender roles in the home.  A fairly sharp postmodern repudiation of that era of American culture, the show is incisive in having little or no ties to modern America.  Instead, the actions of a character can make an in-the-moment critique of a given stuation, and it imbues the show with a sense of timelessness.

Character development drives the show, whether in the workplace or in the Draper household.  Robert Morse is excellent as Bert Cooper, a slightly gentler counterpoint to John Slattery's loutish Roger Sterling.  Vincent Kartheiser makes an indelible impression as ruthless young business shark Peter Campbell, and Elisabeth Moss is perfect as Peggy Olson, a sharp young secretary who wants more for herself.  Also noteworthy in the cast is a pitch-perfect January Jones as Betty Draper.

The Blu-Ray picture and sound is extremely sharp.  The package also includes informative extra featurettes on the period, and thorough commentaries by cast and crew on every Season One episode.

The season also unfolds a compelling mystery regarding Don Draper's identity.  Episode highlights are ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" ""Babylon,"" ""Red In The Face,"" and ""Nixon VS. Kennedy.""  Season One of ""Mad Men"" announces itself as a rare animal, a period drama with incisively salient points to make on contemorary society.",1338595200,2,1972,5.444078947368421

3254737,1,B000YABIQ6,"After enjoying the Sopranos for a few years I was hungry for something of equal quality. Rich, true, complex story telling. I'm sure like many others I was led to Mad Men. Indeed as anyone can see it has lavish, rich, tip-top professional production values. I didn't like Don Draper 1/4th as much as Tony Soprano but you can't have everything. It's like they combed the world to find a Jack Kerouac clone but this one is in advertising. No matter. He has his fans. Still there is the enchanting and beautiful Christina Hendricks playing Joan Harris and the, ""you can't keep your eyes off her"" beautiful January Jones playing Betty Draper. But here's the thing. I have read how the creator of this show, Matthew Weiner says it would just be a joke if smoking were not included in this retro show. But this is 2012 not 1963 and we know that such relentless use and glamorizing of smoking (to say nothing of drinking the hard stuff at every possible turn) will, when seen my millions of people will greatly promote smoking which we know very well will lead to grisly miserable death of hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands. Yes there is smoking on the Sopranos but the brilliant David Chase has one character nearly coughing to death as he gets another cigarette driving a car and Mr. Sack the New York boss is dying of cancer and says how he had just quit. Mad Men? Well there is Betty Draper very, very pregnant (in season 3) smoking and her father says for her to stop, he doesn't want to see her commit suicide. Then a moment later he says for her to go ahead. Meanwhile, later, he is seen shaking salt on his ice cream and drops dead the every next episode. As if, look! See! People do all kinds of risky behaviors like salting ice cream. I'm merely saying they can have all the smoking they wish but it could be presented in such a way that would discourage people from smoking rather then what this show does. There is no excuse for this ""willful blindness"". This is a huge promotion and love song to cigarette smoking and hard drinking and there is a net effect. Profits for them, very happy tobacco executives and a lot of dead people that merely flipped on the T.V. one day. Matthew Weiner, Scott Hornbacher, Maria and Andre Jacquemetton, Black McCormick, Christopher Manley, Jon Mamm, January Jones and the rest that directly showcase smoking belong in jail not on TV.",1335830400,6,2390,4.521939953810624

Although you may need the Commentaries to find out who some of the main actors are,if you never watched it on TV, and if you intend to listen to the Commentaries, I would recommend watching the 13 episodes first and then going back and listen to the Commentaries. These Commentaries are pretty episode-specific for the most part, so it may be hard to remember exactly what happened in an episode that way, but it is better than having the future episodes spoiled to an extent before you get to them. Because there was so much going on in each episode, they were not completely ruined, but it would have been better if the future plots were kept under wraps as they said they were during the actual first season run, and talking only about that or previous episodes.

3254786,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is the first television series I've seen that feels like a theatrical movie rather than another jittery, overly busy, manipulative made-for-TV video series, with frequently good acting wasted on formulaic, or non-existent, plots (the ""criminal minds"" of the series by that title are the writers) relying upon sensation, violence, and cheap digital effects to hook and maintain the viewer's interest. Moreover, the characters in ""Mad Men"" are not cardboard stereotypes but multidimensional and complex.  But perhaps not as much as they would like to think.  Women viewers need not feel guilty about watching ""Mad Men"" on the basis of the following features designed to attract a large female audience: the compelling if not magnetic quality of the flawed but strong and reassuringly handsome lead, John Hamm, who plays ultra-cool ad man Don Draper (he's got the right charisma to anchor an entire James Bond movie series); the representation of women in the 1960's, a period that requires a woman to be at once a ""toy doll,"" a ""perfect housewife,"" and of course, an unquestionably competent secretary, who has nothing but time on her hands to perform her duties with unfailing mechanical precision, always ready with the proper smile or facial expression at the proper time (or risk being fired, and without the ceremony offered incompetent male employees).

Needless to say, the women who ""succeed"" are those who are, by the unspoken requirements of their subordinate position, academy-award winning actresses, capable of either a. landing a man who is a paid ticket to a suburban castle with charming children (and servants to smooth out life's ruffles) or b. miraculously carving out a place where they are recognized for their actual abilities, talents and individual potential.  The slights inflicted upon women on a continual basis are subtle and cumulative.  Like the series itself, the duplicity required of women to succeed, or simply to survive, in the work place becomes manifest gradually, requiring the viewer to pay close attention to the smallest details of dialogue and ""mis en scene"" (by contrast, most television series make NO demands of their viewers because there's ""nothing to look at"": in the overwhelming majority of television dramas the moving camera and shock editing is relentless, continually loud and intrusive of the home spectator's viewing space: in television, it seems, ""overstatement"" rules, giving the viewer no room for choice let alone interpretation. The medium behaves as though its only mission is, as quickly and as surely as possible, to ""captivate"" a witless audience that will think and feel as the camera and sound-track dictate.  ""Mad Man"" is, by contrast, an imitation of a far more recognizable life, one offering inscrutable, even dangerous ""games"" to every individual who's in the job market, desperate for a good job with benefits and opportunities for advancement but damned if he allows the urgency to show.  Moreover, the series is undeniably, from its first smoke-filled shots, a ""period piece"" that represents the '60s as some of us will certainly (if reluctantly) remember those years.  But it's more than a disturbing view of the past: it's a critique of the unexamined life and, necessarily, of the life of commercial television in the present age of ""late""-capitalism, when even the most under-educated viewers are becoming increasingly aware of the unbreachable divide between the haves and the have-nots, between those who exploit and profit from the desires of the American consumer and those suddenly made aware of the high cost of the American Dream and its increasing distance from the vast majority.

You may need to pick up the series for rescreening if, to select a chapter at random, you missed the following in Episode 7, ""Red in the Face"":  The subtle collusion between Don and the elevator operator to assure the unforgettable climax of Roger's humiliation.  Notice Don's brief business with him both before and after the oysterfest, and notice the expressions on Roger's and Don's faces at the end of the episode.  Besides such details, consider the overaching design of the episode.  The theme is male predators, survival of the fittest, and misplaced hubris.  Roger will hit on Betty Draper, and the pathetic Pete will do the same with the store clerk who refuses to refund in cash his returned chip and dip.  Both come up empty-handed, though both try to sustain their moment of heroism.  Pete's sitting Peggy down on a couch to hear his story of gutting a rabbit and eating it in view of the fair damsel is parallell with Roger's stories to the overly appreciative (in Don's double-standard view)  Betty.  Then we have the chivalric subtheme of Betsy playing the fair princess to the unlikely 8-year-old knight whose mother's negligence leads to his coveting a lock of Betty's golden hair.  It's a rare moment when Betty is both the object of adoration and an empathetic mother who reaches out (which she can't do with her own family).  But just as Don blames her for Roger's bad behavior, the suddenly possessive mother of the wandering knight takes offense at Betty's gift.  As usual, she's sent back to the psychiatrist, though the planting of the rifle as Pete's new toy will take its rightful place in the story when Betsy takes a gun to the neighbor's pidgeons.  It's a moment of rage that is long overdue.

Along with the examination of the pressure-cooker capitalism, the series is especially concerned with the roles demanded of (and therefore ""played by"") women.  The seeds are being planted throughout the entire first season, but the fully realized force of the objectification and belittlement of women (nothing so obvious as ""harassment"") will culminate in a chilling, unforgettable and appropriately titled episode, ""A Night to Remember,"" in the 2nd season (episode 8 from the 2008 season). The episode is a cinematic tour deforce, thus far the most ambitious chapter in a series that seems to be reinventing itself as it goes along, always improving. This particular segment is like vintage Robert Altman in its cross-cutting among the three women who have received the most attention. The time, historically, is the days immediately following news of Marilyn Monroe's suicide, and each of the three women--Joan, the queen-secretary who is herself a combination of keen intelligence in an hour-glass figure; Betty, the manipulated, blonde showgirl/perfect housewife/showcase trophy of Don Draper; Peggy, the innocent ""country girl"" who has wised-up sufficiently to the ways of men to play their game, attaining power to make decisions that will influence consumers throughout the nation--each of the three will receive potentially shattering epiphanies, showing them the emptiness of their programmed existences in a male-run world that expects of them only compliance along with adoration beyond any they themselves might receive for their physical attributes.  The realizations of all three occur in a breath-taking ""tour de force"" of characterization. The potent mix of minimalist but thoughtful script-writing, artful directing, and ""parallel"" editing allows the viewer to receive the full force of three separate ""actions"" (actually, internal ""epiphanies"") occurring simultaneously.

The series is uncomfortably faithful to the period, not only in its portrayal of male-female relationships in and outside the workplace but in the continuous gauzy veil of smoke thrown off by chain-smoking characters along with the ubiquitous portable bars in the offices of hard-drinking executives (just a few examples of the irony of the ad squad coming under the influence of its own subliminal messages).  Most of the action is internal yet highly appealing to the eye, taking place in an office space that seems both capacious and capable of showing the viewer surprises and new discoveries with each episode. The colors are richly saturated--crisp and vibrant technicolor (not the faded, irridescent reds, blues, and greens that would replace them beginning in the late '60s and continuing throughout the 1970s), with a brightly lit, crystal clear, sharp resolution and a camera lens with revealing ""depth of field"" that takes full advantage of the big flat, high definition screens that have begun to dominate domestic space in just the past 5-6 years of the new millennium; the camera work--with striking angles but steady shots of sufficient duration to allow the spectator to see each crucial detail--has the professional sheen of a bonafide ""auteur"" such as the admired 1950s ""Hollywood"" director, Douglas Sirk.

Frankly, I had all but ""given up"" on television--except for the talking heads on MSNBC and the mindless reality shows like ""Pawn Stars"" and ""American Pickers.""  Most of what passes for television drama is manipulative and ""busy"" to a degree that the viewer is placed in the paradoxical position of having nothing to look at.  Viewers are denied the ""freedom to see"" on their ever larger, higher definition screens.  Everything of importance to the sponsors and filmmakers is magnified or grossly overstated, then thrown in the spectator's face by the hyperactive videocam and ""shock"" editing. But this series, sponsored appropriately enough by American Movie Classics, is the most refreshing, ground-breaking television drama since ""All in the Family."" We should all hope that it represents a new beginning rather than an anomaly, unique and distinguished as it is.",1327622400,2,9479,5.245208195637805

To watch the value shaping influence that advertising in the 50s had on us today--with some damned sexy people to boot--it a complete and utter delight!!!

3254789,4,B000YABIQ6,"I sat down to watch ONE episode of this much discussed series. I ended up watching the whole first season (not recommended). It is relentlessly compelling, it is slavish as to period detail (and I would know, I was about 6 at the time that this series is set in), it is very well made, atmospheric in extreme and so attentively constructed that I should have loved every minute of it.

For those who are familiar with the term ""film noir"" then this is TV noir, and noir it is. One can be pulled into the very complex lives of each character yet not care about them in the least, save perhaps the secretary Peggy and I guess Don Draper and his Grace-Kelly-lite wife. (Both are so well played that to call it acting is a disservice to their efforts, they ARE these people, it is quite astonishing).

Much as Miami Vice was once a standout production (sound, costume, location, intriguing protagonists, some unexpected ones like Edward James Olmos, who MADE that whole show even have credibility) I suspect Mad Men is a similar quantity for today's overwhelmed viewer. I came from the advertising community, though not circa 1960!, and I can vouch for the attitudes and manner of Draper and coworkers, but it takes their careers and intermeshes into their personal character to such an extent as to be problematic. One of Draper's finest observations, and I won't give away any of the narrative plotlines, is when he muses how the younger generation has no one to look up to, just ""us"" meaning Draper and his incredibly flawed business partners, clients and neighbors.

You want to care about them but it is darn near impossible. I did really take to the department store side line, Menckens, both father and daughter, but to say more is to give it away.

3254829,3,B000YABIQ6,"The debut season of this series is, plot-wise, certainly good enough to keep viewers wanting more.  And the actors are competent, though too often they are victims of an overwrought, parody-prone direction that skews the stolidness of their performanances.  For, truly, this cinematic offering is farcical and was meant to be.
The premiere episodes of Mad Men deal with the legacy of the Fifties, and the show's creators have pulled out all the stops in mocking and denigrating the decade.  That alone will make for low satire, but the entire effort is enervated by an obvious lack of knowledge and understanding of the era.  Even in the basest forms of farce, the achievement of the sardonic depends on reality as its foundation, and the failure to employ subtlety in the treatment can doom its effectiveness.  For instance, this series presents smoking as ubiquitous and feverish in a manner that it never was.  At a time in which the activity was accepted almost everywhere, people did it leisurely.  There was no need to puff like a freight train for a nicotine high in a non-forbidden zone.  Many people used matches instead of lighters, and they didn't light up indoors with one hand shielding against a non-existent wind.  This kind of exaggeration results not in satire, but in burlesque.
As for pacing, the first couple of episodes are hobbled by a seemingly desperate impulse to inject as much anti-Fifties propaganda as an audience could be expected to stomach.  White males are overtly chauvinistic, white females overtly compliant, and blacks of both sexes menial-working, overtly servile, covertly surly, resentful, unhappy people.  After these wearisome premises have been well, well established, then the series gets more deeply into plotting.
The show's lead, Dan Draper, is not the manipulative, mercenary, unscrupulous, cut-throat character one might expect from the title.  Despite a sexist viewpoint, he treats women well.  He doesn't demean or prey on co-workers, and his on-the-side sex is with self-competent women.  He is affectionate and passionate with his wife.
Yet the creators' compulsion to spoof the Fifties/Sixties demands that they present Mrs. Draper as a neurotic, self-centered suburban housewife who worries about pretty divorcees and would rather see her daughter dead that facially scarred.  She lets her children put plastic dry-cleaning covers over their heads and romp unbelted in her vehicle.  As she putters about in her pumps and crinolined dresses, she presents an over-the-top image of a demented Fifties homemaker who, she earnestly tells Draper, thinks of nothing else but having sex with him.  Indeed, she does have a handsome, attentive, hardworking husband who many women would covet, yet she fantacizes about coupling with a milktoasty salesman/stranger and--somehow--orgasms against a running washing machine.  But, then again, the series' only all-together women are promiscuous.  Even single career women with one lover are portrayed as naive, frustrated, or unhealthily guilt-ridden.  Pre-sexual-revolution females, the series all but shouts, were mostly miserable creatures who often died in childbirth or succumbed young to dreadful diseases.  Christianity crippled them emotionally and intellectually and, in at least one case, created a wicked stepmother.  By the time 1960 rolled around, they were dizzily wearing mismatched clothing, draping living room furniture, and voting for Richard Nixon.
The problem with the program as lampoon is that it also strives to be a serious, ongoing serial that maintains interest and sympathy in Dan Draper.  It doesn't aid the drama to stick him in the same style of Production-Code pajamas that are also donned by his squirrely co-worker/rival or to subject the character and audience alike to  boring, protracted scenes like a beatnik debauch wherein everyone simply gets stoned.
The best aspect of the series is the business intrigue that has little or nothing to do with the show's sex, which is often as hurried and unpassionate as a toilet-stall encounter between strangers.  Scenes that do denote true affection are, of course, subject to the usual modern-day dread of deep kissing between actors and thus come off as chaste and staid.
The cause of the latter matter is something that really did begin in the Sixties.",1321315200,,4324,5.31424375917768

3254874,3,B000YABIQ6,"I heard a lot of great things about this show, and I figured I would watch it, to give it a chance. But unfortunately, the show seems a slow primetime soap opera aimed at mostly women; strange given the setting and content therein.  This fact disappointed me quite a bit.

Sure the production and acting is top-notch. But this is easy to do if you throw money around. The problem here is that the usual soap-opera staples are all here on display; the homewrecker that you luv to hate, the unattractive frumpy good girl that you should root for, the bad-boy lead, the nerdy loser who's only good for an one-nighter, etc.

The reason that I've never been fond of soaps is because I find them plodding, roundabout, and generally tacky stuff. But most important, they seem to emphasize the worst in humanity. The men are pretty boy meatheads or losers with crappy self-worth and hearts of gold (but are horrible lovers), the females almost always uniformly unpleasant people and nothing ever happpens in these shows; nothing ever gets done. I must come out here and say, I fancy myself a bit of a fiction writer and I hate these stupid tropes that tv writers lean on...but it makes bucks.

And I'm a guy that tries to give these chick-flick soaps a chance. But they never keep me around long, sadly. I'm always run off. So many great pilots of interesting dramas get bait-switched into these backstabbing snobby harpy character vehicles that no wonder I gave up on television years ago.

I just don't like that lame tactic, in particular. Shows about simple plot, characterization and actual meaning and purpose becomes ""he slept with her and she got mad and tried to kill him, but then they made up and then ""A MISUNDERSTANDING"" happened, and now she hates him again and now she cheated on him with his nerdy friend and he clammed up and couldn't satisfy her, so she went back to Bad Boy and batted her eyelashes because ""I'M THAT HOT"" and ""MEN ARE EASY"" and of course he took her back, but he was SO MAD cause he's BADBOY and he slapped her HARD in the face, and now she's gonna sue him to MAKE HIM PAY, but the lawyer is cute, so I gonna seduce the lawyer now, and get revenge (plus he's loaded!!) against BADBOY, but he finds out and Lawyer and BadBoy fistfight each other over my honor and...well, the point has been made.

Yeesh. After a while, it's all 'bla-bla-blah'.  I just don't get it.  But it's very well produced, so you gotta give it points for that, at least.  Sigh.",1317168000,,2478,4.513392857142857
3254875,4,B000YABIQ6,"I must admit that my first encunter with Mad Men was not a good one.  I missed the entire first season and decided to try picking up with the first episode of the second season when it originally aired.  Big mistake!  Not only is that one of the weaker episodes of the second season (in my opinion) but attempting to jump on board with this series without having viewed any of the first is nearly impossible.  The characters created by Matthew Weiner and his creative team are remarkably layered and difficult to read and it is essential to start at the beginning in order to be able to more fully understand who these people are and what makes them tick.  So I recently went back to the very beginning and I was pleasantly surprised at just how engrossing, intelligent and shockingly moving it all turned out to be.  But you have to be patient.  Mad Men peels away the layers of its characters slowly and with precision never forcing the action along or making the characters do anything that feels unbeievable or forced.  The result is an admittedly slow pace, but after time it becomes almost hypnotic and the payoffs are huge.

On the surface, Mad Men appears to be a highly stylized re-creation of the early 60's advertising business right down to the tiniest details.  But in reality, the show is all about what lies beneath that sleek surface and in Mad Men's case, that's a lot.  While the employees of the Sterling Cooper ad agency go about their daily routines (which include driniking and smoking in the workplace, treating the women in the office like objects and casually engaging in extramarital affairs), the entire cultural/social/poltical landscape is rapidly shifting.  The men and women of Mad Men are still clinging to the values and social conventions that were in place before the 60's tore the nation apart and redefined the roles of women and minorities and laid the groundwork for an entirely new national psyche.

But Mad Men is also about the emotions, desires, wounds and other messy issues that the characters fight so desperately to avoid.  I think it's fair to say that part of the shows glacier pacing is a direct result of the strain on nearly every character to avoid dealing with things.  So a lot of time is spent watching the Mad Men and their wives/mistresses focus entirely on their work and the day to day routines that barely hold back the flood of emotions threatening to break free.

""Mad Men"" takes place in 1960 and follows the lives of the men (and women) who work for an ad agency on Madison Avenue in New York City. There is nothing bad about this show. My favorite thing about it is the overall look of the show. It's so beautiful, the costumes are gorgeous, everyone smoked and drank 24/7 because it was socially acceptable back then...what's now to like?!

The main character, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is a conflicted man. He has issues at work, issues at home, and a mysterious past that slowly begins to unravel as the season progresses. Don is married to Betty (January Jones), a picture-perfect housewife who is blonde and cute as a button, but I HATE HER!!! She is such a terrible person and I do not blame Don at all for all his philandering. There's an outstanding cast of supporting characters as well. I think Roger (John Slattery) and Joan (Christina Hendricks) are my favorites. Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) is super annoying and I hate her almost as much as I hate Betty (but not quite).

I love that, because this is an AMC show and not an HBO show, there are a few curses uttered here and there, but no violence, no nudity, and no use of profanity every third or fourth word. Everything is elegantly implied, which is so great, especially for a show set in this era. I am so glad it's on AMC.

The storylines are wonderful and I cannot wait to keep watching Seasons 2, 3, and 4!",1315785600,,1500,4.388489208633094

Its also unfortunate that someone would give an episode a one star, as an opportunity to whine about a technical problem as opposed to writing about the episode...anyway...This episode is great; probably one of my all time favs. Probably because it has great examples of all the things fans enjoy about the show: historical context via an important event like the approaching 1960 presidential election between JFK and Nixon, the ultimate ad man's con, as he ruthlessly pursues Don, the men in the office at the height of their arrogance, self-entitlitled, sexist and sexually harassing worst... And then there is Betty...This may be one of her greatest episodes...possibly the first where we begin to see the complexity of her character, her family history, its effects on her parenting, and the toll of being a suburban housewife.

The story is gripping, with surprising depth. ""Who is this Don Draper guy and why does he do what he does?"" is the question that keeps you watching. The pitch about the Kodak slide carousel was incredible, for example. And it's fascinating to see a glimpse of that long-gone world of 1960. I really don't understand the reviewers here who found the show boring.

There is, however, way too much sex for my taste. Way way too much. Were people really that immoral back then? I don't know but I don't want to see it so explicitly.",1309305600,2,672,4.419354838709677

There is great joy in celebrating the era which is shown in the wonderful attention to detail. This attention also is shown in the way Mad Men delves into the effects of that era on the American psyche. If you grew up in that era you will be constantly be entertained by the period detail and the take on the rise of the American corporate beast. This is the Industrial Military Complex defined. If you are younger and seeing it for the first time you should not discount the hedonism, greed and avarice that permeates every episode. They were and still are the defining characteristics of the post WW II American evolution. It's also what built the powerful economy that now is in tatters. The same types of men doing the same types of jobs you see in Mad Men now worry about how fast they can get out of the American market. They only want to tap into the international economy that is swiftly passing us by in order to continue the ritual. This series is highly recommended to fans of ennui and the smoking of many cigarettes. Hey, that sounds almost...French.",1303257600,,1201,4.723809523809524
3254930,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is one great series. The ensemble cast is really outstanding. Jon Hamm as Donald Draper is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen. At once dispicable and flawed, and at the same time noble and redeemable, he is by turns maddeningly clueless about relationships and incredibly astute about the ad biz. Elizabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen portrays a young woman who sees the possibilities for women in general and herself in particular at the beginning of the women's movement of the 60's. The sets and costuming are well researched and the whole feel is very true to the era. The fact that the writers include major events ( Cuban missle crisis, JFK death) of the time and their effects on the characters is also a good feature.
I highly recommend this whole series.",1302566400,,777,4.678832116788321

decided to purchase. All I can say is WOW, what a show, I could not stop watching. The acting is 1st rate and the stories are riveting.

To me being 50 years old, i always thought the 60's was a much less complicated time, more family oriented, simpler and people generally had better morals. If this show is any indication as to how it really was, then perhaps nothing ever really changes. The
only thing that really pisses me off about that time was the dismissive way men treated women, and perhaps they still do but the
men today have to be much less overt about it.

I had heard all the hype it was getting as well as the multiple awards it had won. In my opinion the show is really not as great as everyone says. Sure, the acting is good but you can get that with every other great show on TV that gets nowhere near the hype Mad Men does. I'm a fan of shows like Breaking Bad, LOST, 24, Dexter, and formely The Sopranos even though the last few seasons were not as great as it once was. With Mad Men I see most of the charcacters as very arrogant and unlikeable. It really is not addicting as everyone says. There isn't anything exciting about it. It has nowhere near the quality of a show like Breaking Bad. If you missed the boring slowness of the last few seasons of The Sopranos than watch Mad Men. Even The Sopranos never got as much praise as Mad Men. I'm writting this review under a different name because I fear that I will be assisinated by the liberals at the telivison academy for condeming a show thats so higly praised by everyone when realistically it is just an overhyped period drama that is most likely not historically accurate.

Honestly, I began watching Mad Men because I was sick of it winning all the awards that I wanted ""LOST"" to win.  I just had to see what the buzz was about.

I started Season One less than a month ago, and have all ready watched through the end of Season Four.

In my experience, in order for a TV show to work, it has to make you care about it's characters. The creators of Mad Men have done this with impeccable finesse. The characters in the show are almost excruciatingly human. They are jaded and flawed in such away that anyone can relate to them.  The writers took time to show some of the key characters' back stories, which helps explain what makes them tick.

You will find yourself entranced by the seduction of these characters, even if you don't agree with many of the things that they do.  They make mistakes... they fail... sometimes they succeed. And you will be pulling for them all the way.

The quality of Mad Men does not belong on Television.  Every episode is like watching a very well put together movie that took years to perfect. From the script, to the music, to the cinematography.

The historical setting (Madison Avenue circa 1960) is great for showing us how times have changed during the past two generations, every character is developed and portrayed in a way that I can believe and empathize with, and countless facets of the human condition are explored with remarkable depth and nuance, so I'll assert that this series deserves to be classed with the world's great stage productions and literature (dare we mention the name of Shakespeare?).  Simply put, I've learned a lot about life and therefore myself from this series, so my appreciation goes beyond what words can express.

In this first season, you meet Don Draper the slick ad guy as well as a host of secondary characters each of whom are engaging in their own right. You really have to talk to an ad person from the 60's to appreciate how well the directors captured the essence of what it was like to work on a Madison Avenue ad agency in those days.

It is a soap opera ,but a good one. Unlike a soap opera the writing is not empty and the characters are more than cardboard cutouts. Like Don who wants to love his wife and family, but doesn't know how, because he doesn't grasp what love truly is .
And roger the big mouth who is digging his own coffin and partying constantly because he has nothing else left. And betty an accomplished woman who resents being a housewife and makes everyone around her suffer for it.
You can see this desperation in everybodies eyes like they can't stand being stuck in these dumb molds society put them in one more minute.
I love looking at the clothes. The colors are so bright, they hit you in the face. Because I didn't live in this era and the few pictures I have of my grandparents and family during this time are in black and white. So you can't see the vibrant colors. Like what color ball gown so and so was wearing.
It really bothers me some of the things people say to each other. Even though I know people talk like this, then and now.
 Like Roger telling a female friend who is his right arm that she is the finest piece of ass he's has ever had, or how one character tells peggy who is slightly chubby , and she should  enjoy the crude comments made by execs while they last, cuz she isn't much to look at.

One has to witness the perfection in his performance for themselves to really understand Don Draper and Jon Hamm's talent. Don is flawed, the 60's family is flawed and so plastic we wonder if they ever really existed? They did - I grew up during the 60's, and my mom looked like Betts.

3255119,5,B000YABIQ6,"I never watched this program before I got this set on DVD. I have to say that I am very pleased with it, although this isn't the kind of show I normally like. The opening scene of the first episode really served to hook me.

The program is set in the early 1960s in Sterling Cooper, an advertising agency on Madison Avenue. The lead character is Don Draper, an executive and idea man who works at the agency. He has issues, as we find out further and further along in the series. Indeed, is he even who he says he is?

The acting, writing and direction is excellent. I look forward to seeing more shows in this series.",1283126400,,618,4.228813559322034

The characterizations, the sets, the costumes, the behavior chronicles the 60's to a T.  The acting is superb.

3255121,2,B000YABIQ6,"Upon hearing all the hype about their new (4th) season and all the awards, I checked out Season One at the library to try and follow it from the beginning.

As there is a dearth of good drama on tv, I wanted to become a fan, but each episode left me with an empty, dissatisfied feeling, which I blame on the writing.

Many of the sub-plots are simply preposterous, e.g., the lead character stealing the identity of his dead G.I. colleague - right, like he's going to come back to his platoon suddenly claiming to be the other guy (and that he himself died), and no one will be the wiser.  Absurd!

Most all of the major characters are non-sympathetic, so that you're not rooting for anyone, they're all bad (or vapid) people.  The Pete Campbell character I can hardly stand to look at.  Only a few peripheral characters seem to be relatively decent.

I realize normal people don't make complelling television, but it's a too cynical view of the business world; you've got to have some balance.  Some of the scenes are just too over the top: morally revolting (Roger Sterling and his ingnue playthings) and even cruel (Don Draper's treatment of his sympathetic half-brother).

3255163,3,B000YABIQ6,"Kevin McDonald's 'The Culture of Critique: an Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements' (1998, 2002) describes how ""Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual movements during the 20th century."" McDonald argues that ""these movements are an attempt to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. Several of these Jewish movements (e.g., the shift in immigration policy favoring non-European peoples) have attempted to weaken the power of their perceived competitors--the European peoples who early in the 20 century had assumed a dominant position not only in their traditional homelands in Europe, but also in the United States, Canada, and Australia...Ultimately, the movements are viewed as an expression of a group evolutionary strategy by Jews in their competition for social, political, and cultural dominance with non-Jews.""

AMC's 'Mad Men' Season One (2007) and its subsequent seasons are of such exceptional quality that the program practically sets a new standard for television excellence--a very surprising thing to find on American television, whether network or cable, in 2010.

Creator, writer, and director Matthew Weiner's 'Mad Men' is about many things, but it is primarily about the end of an era in American history, an era seen by many as one of America's 'Golden Ages,' and one which was culturally, socially, and financially dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants--WASPs.

WASPs dominate 'Mad Men,' and while the program is superficially sympathetic to its WASP characters some of the time, the viewer can't help notice how married advertising executive Don Draper's Jewish mistress, department store owner Rachel Menken, eventually makes the 'right' choice of rejecting Draper and wedding a respectable Jewish man. Elsewhere in the show, the Jewish men and women that infrequently flit across the screen (potential clients representing the State of Israel's tourism bureau, etc.) are depicted in  largely agreeable, if stoic, terms.

Beneath its always intelligent, amber-hued surface, 'Man Men' is certainly a hard, even an ugly, critique of High WASP culture: though the Drapers and most of the other characters are educated, socially prominent, poised, witty, attractive, and talented, they are also routinely adulterous, alcoholic, and believe women are capable of being little more than sex objects, housewives, or over-the-hill matrons worth deceiving until divorcing.

The show's subtitle, in fact, could accurately be ""Oh, Those AWFUL White People.""

One account executive is so drunk in the midday office that when he urinates in his trousers, the accident has to be pointed out to him by coworkers. Another character allows his eight year-old granddaughter to drive an automobile through the Hudson River Valley's suburban streets. Ad agency partner Roger Sterling enthusiastically performs Stephen Foster songs in blackface at his palatial Long Island estate, sexually propositions Don's wife the moment Don steps out of the room, and unquestioningly assumes that the models used in agency campaigns will have sexual intercourse with him.

A handsome young doctor rapes his newlywed wife on the floor of her office; one presumably loopy secretary runs over and amputates her boss's foot with a riding mower at an office party.

The ad executives smoke marijuana and consort with drug dealers, have their secretaries sit on their laps while doing their typing, and steal mail not addressed to them. Account Executive Peter Campbell attempts to blackmail Draper to force a promotion. A comedian, who has everything to lose and nothing to gain in his action, insults the overweight wife of his sponsor. The Sterling Cooper staff believe Nixon is a natural to win the presidency over Kennedy.

During a casual business meeting, two of the male staff mock the 'awful aprons' worn by the WASP star of 'The Loretta Young Show Show,' and even the fabric pattern on the same program's sofa, but Jewish Bob Dylan is praised during the same discussion.

When Don's beautiful wife, Betty, pushes her adulterous spouse in an explosion of frustration, Don shoves her back with at least equal force. When the Draper family enjoys a picnic on a pristine Hudson River Valley hillside, they blithely leave a small mountain of garbage behind them; Don casually throws his beer bottles in the bushes.

Don fires his male art director for refusing the sexual advances of an important client, also male. When Don discovers one of his mistresses has been discussing him with her friends, he forces her arms behind her, ties her to the bed--and leaves her there. Don rejects his younger sibling, Adam, so completely that Adam hangs himself in despair.

And most tellingly, handsome, dapper, capable Don Draper is not the educated gentleman of the upper class he pretends to be; he's the illegitimate son of a prostitute who died in childbirth, and who was then abusively raised by 'backward' Pennsylvania farmers.

Don is an unconscious misogynist, a compulsive liar, a philanderer, a drunken driver, a sociopath, and a complete fake in almost every sense. His true background is in used cars and furs. Don is false. Though typically presented in the show's deceptively glamorous light, Don is one of Elliot's 'Hollow Men,' empty and stuffed with figurative, existential straw.

All of these incidents and characterizations might be expected and wholly acceptable if 'Mad Men' was a typical American soap opera, whether a tradtional daytime melodrama like 'As the World Turns' or a slice of 1980s primetime kitsch like 'Dynasty.'

But 'Mad Men' is not a soap opera; 'Mad Men' is a 'serious' drama aspiring to be 'serious' 'art' of a kind (though 'The Jet Set' episode in Season Two, in which Don is taken up by an international set of wealthy vagabonds in California, probably the worst-written of any episode in the first four seasons, veers hilariously towards outright soap opera camp).

Much of program is rooted in 'hard' fact (Don Draper is based around legendary ad man Draper Daniels, for example), and appears to accurately reflect history; however, it is WASPs, and by extension, all Europeans of Anglo-Saxon descent who come in for Weiner's and his fellow writers' continuous spleen (copy writer Peggy Olson, for instance, is Catholic and from a lower middle class Brooklyn background). Black and Hispanic characters are few and relegated far to the sidelines.

Though the show is thought-provoking, entertaining, and often brilliantly written and produced, the excessive critique of Western European-American culture is unfair to its subject, insofar as Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics are almost completely exempted from the same criticism. When Jewish, Black or Hispanic characters do appear, they are presented as either victims of WASP culture or shrewd individuals who use their intelligence to avoid both victimization and personal moral and ethical failing.

Viewers will be hard-pressed to imagine a program with a similar show of teeth being made by Protestants about Jews; the outcry against it would be tremendous, and cries of anti-Semitism would flood the media landscape.

'Mad Men' is simply another in a series of 'blows against the empire' WASP America has suffered since the 1960s. It succeeds in its own way because, thanks to the forces aggressively united against WASP America for four decades, many of which are now a dominant presence the media, today almost everyone is quite familiar with the narrative 'Mad Men' is selling: ""We all know that that is how White people are, and certainly were then.""

Watch and enjoy 'Mad Men'; but by all means watch it critically, as it deserves to be watched, and do not overlook what the show fairly celebrates: the Fall of the American Anglo, which the opening credits dramatize quite literally.",1282176000,9,8011,5.30205047318612
3255164,5,B000YABIQ6,"I'll just chime in with what everyone else is saying: this is great television.

The writing is astounding. The acting is excellent. There is little of the overacting and cliches that plague most modern television. The ""Kodak carousel"" scene is one of the great scenes in all of television.

Unfortunately, the series dropped off sharply after the first season and started to accrete cliches, although it still had moments of wonder.

The blu-ray looks very good and I strongly advise it over the DVD. The textures from the 1960s are interesting to see, for one thing, and the characters, because they do not overact, require close scrutiny.",1281916800,,641,4.97196261682243

I've now seen all of season one and REALLY liked it.

As I told a friend of mine when recommending it. This tells the story of the era where we come from. I was born in 1960 which is the year of season one.

Shall we say times have a changed a LOT since then. It is hard to imagine that things were as depicted, but they probably were - well, I suspect they exaggerate maybe a tad, but maybe not. Politically correct it is not.

One thing is all the smoking. I mean, it is constant. And the drinking. And ""bad"" behavior.

People think we live in a more enlightened time now and maybe we do, but still watching this show, I cannot help but feel that we lost something we need to find again in the process.

If you can't remember the early 1960's, take a look. It does seem to be true to life setting wise. They did an incredible job there.

Briefly, the show centers around a guy working in an ad agency in New York starting in 1960. He has a mysterious past which is explained late in the first season. He is a likable guy, but he has some big flaws - at least as we see things now anyway. We meet his wife and family in the series and people he works with as well as many colorful clients.

3255170,5,B000YABIQ6,"Sometimes a TV series or movie comes along which hits on all eight cylinders.  Mad Men is one of them.  I'm a bit young to remember the time period of Mad Men's first season (1960), but the tone of the times feels right.

Casting is wonderful.  Jon Hamm as Don Draper is a real find.  This guy is perfect in the role, Brylcreem and all.  He is a ad genius, a madly successful ad man who thinks on his feet, has brilliant insights, a beautiful loving wife (the unbelievably attractive January Jones), and two smart kids.  He has it all, but wants more.  He beds a series of women, because he likes them and likes the sex.  He just assumes his wife will be oblivious to that; and in those times maybe that happened more often than not.

There are films or series that are mainly set in the workplace, but most don't focus on the day-to-day interactions, at that workplace.  We don't learn how to behave or interact in those series.  Obviously, there are some notable ones, but most of even those (The Office, NYPD Blue, House, The Wire) feature people we just don't know that well (cops, doctors, comedy writers, (and in the case of the Office, complete goofs)).  Mad Men, we can identify with, because we all consider ourselves somewhat of experts on advertising, since we see lots and lots of it, every day.

Very Highly Recommended. An excellent show in all regards.  Five plus stars for Mad Men.  They have a winner here.  Can you believe that HBO passed on this one?

Let me add a bit on the DVD extras.  There are a lot of them, and insightful.  We learn, for example, that the first show (the pilot) was filmed in New York before moving to LA.  The sets feature ceilings, because the director wanted to show the period suspended ceilings (most productions have no ceilings because that's where the lights and other equipment hang).",1277510400,,1836,4.503030303030303

3255172,3,B000YABIQ6,"I will keep this short since so many other people have made excellent comments on this series, and thus I would only be repeating their words.

We never saw MAD MEN on TV, we only just now rented the first season on DVD.

Oddly it was one of those new shows we saw advertised once years ago, but then never heard or saw anything more about it.  We never even came across it by accident turning channels over the past 3 years.

But the people working on this show deserve great praise for bringing the early 1960s alive !!

Sometimes you forget you are watching a recreation of the 60s and feel like you are really watching something from that era.

Much of the show's initial charm rests in it's nostalgic recreation of the culture of the era ........ we can also get a chuckle by seeing products featured on the show we remember from our younger days.

The only small critique I may make is the storylines sometime move at such a slow and agonizing pace it gets a little boring.

Despite the praise above, I must confess after 2 seasons, we have lost all interest in the show.

I suppose it cant' be helped being a time period drama, but it started to feels like nothing more than a daytime Soap Opera but set in the 60s.

Maybe the unique novelty of being so authentically set in the 60s made it feel special for 2 Seasons ....... but now it just plods along like an episode of ""As The World Turns"".

3255215,5,B000YABIQ6,"FABULOUS, FABULOUS!  Better than Sopranos, which is better than anything else on TV.
  Obviously I wholeheartedly agree with most previous reviews. I just want to add my two cents to highlight some areas that I think reviewers didn't quite do justice to:
1. Don's Wife:  Betty Draper is often stereotyped by reviewers as being a gorgeous ""childlike"" Stepford wife type.  I disagree. There is much more to her than meets the superficial eye.  She is a woman with beautifully portrayed ambivalence--she revels in, and dazzles us, in her in her breezy handling of her assigned role as gorgeous, loving, devoted wife and mother, and housewife.  But, inside, there is depression, loneliness, alienation, and even anger and a sense of entrapment.  Indeed, her lines reveal this at almost every turn.  On the one hand, she is clearly an opinion leader among her neighborhood girlfriends, (e.g. in her persuading her friends to show some tolerance and sympathy for the divorcee who just joined the neighborhood), and she is a complete equal in her intelligent repartees with Don.  On the other hand, she is a nervous hostess, full of anxiety to put on the perfect birthday party for her little girl, and she is afflicted with some scary psychosomatic numbness and shaking in her hands, which lead her to the 1960s shrink's couch.  Her relationship with Don is a beautifully scripted and choreographed blend of real love, with a partnership of openness and honesty with regard to all of their SHARED life, battling with deception, and clandestine played out escape fantasies in each of their private lives.
2. As many reviewers comment, Mad Men is a real gem of a presentation of an anti-PC, ""in your face"" 1960s world.  BUT, it doesn't simply flaunt and revel in the ""capitalist"", ""materialistic"", ""vice-ridden"" culture.
  Far from glorifying this lifestyle, it displays, indeed very much wants to capture the viewer's attention to, all the darkness, the traps, the alienation, the Darwinian competition, and the sickness, that this world creates!  Indeed, this very unapologetic flamboyant, and gorgeous, movie quality TV show, treats the viewer with a rare degree of respect--the viewer sees it as it really was, and judges without interference or propaganda, for him or her self.  What a rare treat!",1273276800,3,2294,5.077333333333334

The picture quality on the blu-ray is far superior to the DVD, though it does have a few quirks that are a product of the transfer. The sound is better as well, allowing the sound design to breathe more openly.

I did experience a bad copy of a first disc where the image froze for almost a minutes length on episode 3, but Amazon was good enough to replace it right away. No technical problems the second time around. One thing I appreciate about Amazon is they don't make you send the defective copy back before they send you a replacement.

3255220,5,B000YABIQ6,"Although I did not grow up as the child of a Madison Avenue type, I recognize this as the world of my childhood.  I guess that I was about the age of Don's daughter Sally back then.  Mad Men certainly captures the ambiance of that highly sexualized and politically incorrect era.  I find Don and his pals both troubling and sympathetic.  The men are certainly passionate about their work, but their interactions with their wives and girlfriends seem almost completely phoned in.  When Don looses an client--he is shattered--but loosing a girlfriend (or a terrible fight with his wife) hardly makes him blink.  Really, the only relationship between a man and a woman that seems significant to me is that between Pete Campbell and his  wife Trudy--even though he is fooling around with Peggy on the side.

I also find Don interesting as a sort of interface between the 60's Urban metropolis of his work world and his depression era rural roots.  One of my parents came from a rural community and home lit by only kerosine lanterns and devoid of indoor plumbing.  Much of my young life was spent trying to come to terms with the modern world as seen through the prism of my parents' rural and small town perspective.  Sadly for poor Don though, his childhood was an unpleasant one that left him without the emotional context necessary to find happiness in his personal life.",1268438400,,1371,4.718487394957983

The pace is fairly slow to begin with but sets the scene perfectly as the season draws to its climax. The main character is extremely complex, interesting and never fails to leave you astounded. No surprise he has won multiple awards for his performances (notably Golden Globes). The way women are portrayed is extremely unsettling for people born after this generation but I'm sure hits the mark.

3255277,5,B000YABIQ6,"After seeing the first season of ""Mad Men"", it's easy to see why it has won so many awards. The acting is superb. The stories and characters are engaging and interesting; you might not always like them, but they're never boring. The sets and costumes are very authentic. It only took watching one episode to get me hooked. Everything about the show feels authentic, with the characters having attitudes and behavior one would expect in the early 1960s. Many of the characters are seen drinking in the office and smoking everywhere. At times they are also rather sexist and racist. That's not to say these issues don't exist today, but they were even more prevalent then. As a result, the characters aren't always likable. Despite their many flaws, each character is developed enough to give you something to like or feel empathetic toward.

The main character, Don Draper, is the creative director at the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency on Madison Ave. in New York City. He cheats on his wife, although he still seems to care for her and it's not quite clear why he cheats. Don is a very strong and talented person; besides infidelity, he has other flaws and a somewhat mysterious past. Betty is married to Don and they have 3 kids. She is not quite happy with her life as it is. While she is not weak by any means, Betty plays the obedient wife role to Don and raises the kids with the help of a maid. Peggy Olson (my favorite character) is Don's new secretary. Coming to the big city from a smaller town background is an adjustment for Peggy, who still dresses as a young woman might in school; Miss Holloway, the head secretary, tries to mold Peggy in her image. While Peggy is soft-spoken, she soon shows she has her own talents. Pete Campbell is a young account exec whose family is wealthy and well-known. He's engaged to be married but is attracted to Peggy too. He clashes with Don in his attempts to get ahead in the company. Also working at the agency are many other interesting characters, from the art director Sal Romano to the partners Roger Sterling and Bert Cooper.

The storylines are varied, with the ad agency setting providing interesting client interactions and the diverse characters' lives being anything but dull.

In this version all housewives are depressed and seeing shrinks, all husbands cheat, everybody drinks, smokes and slaps their kids around.  The critics like to call this show intelligent, they don't say why and I'm not sure either.  Maybe it's because of the liberal and gratuitous references to the holocaust and nazi's (which are completely out of place in a conference room in an advertising agency in the 1960's).

3255328,5,B000YABIQ6,"Ah the cigarettes, the sexism, the smarmy executives, the docile secretaries, the bored housewives ... welcome to America in 1960 and specifically Madison Ave where this engrossing series is set.

We are in the macho world of advertising execs on a quest to sell the perfect product while drinking and screwing their way to perdition. Much of the fun is seeing how much things have changed. Did people really smoke that much? I felt as if I was getting lung cancer just from watching them. They light up first thing in the morning, before meals, after meals, during sex, on the train, in the car, in the kitchen, in the toilet, in the office. The whole world musty have smelled of smoke. That lovely, blond, Grace Kelly look alike with the peaches and cream comlexion must have given off the odor of an ashtray.

Were people really so sexist? Women, or rather girls, are treated totally like objects -- of desire, or more accurately of lust, of ridicule, of disdain, of pity, of scorn -- never ever as equals.

The main character, Donald Draper, is a handsome, suave  and talented adman with a wife, two kids, a couple of mistresses and a secret. His secretary, Peggy Olson in an ingenue on the way up. Various other sleazy types inhabit the office. We also see Draper's home life, his lovely but bored wife Betty and the kids.

There's a lot of pleasure to be had from spotting the period references. The reconstruction of the early sixties milieu seems to be flawless. Wonderful artifacts of the period, half-forgotten, seem to pop up at every moment. But of course, we're not really in 1960 -- we're looking back at ourselves not so long ago and wondering at how far we've come -- and how far we still have to go.

This is a great series.",1263945600,6,1741,4.564102564102564
3255329,5,B000YABIQ6,"I cannot comment on the show. I think everyone before me has already stated how great and original the show is. It's a shame that HBO rejected this series. I bet someone's smacking his head right now.

However, I'd like to comment on the Blu-ray package itself.

The unsophisticated packaging is a double edged sword in my opinion. It gives us a cheaper product to buy in exchange for a great show. However, it's not something to gloat about in your collection. HBO series tend to have this hugely elaborate packaging that makes their shows stick out on your video rack. Yeah it's all fancy, but it just leads to a more expensive product taking up more space.

The packaging itself makes it look like a regular Blu-ray. Nothing fancy.

Other than that the menus are easy to use. A little bit too many warning sings for the paranoid MPAA, but other than that it's a great product.",1263686400,,879,4.544303797468355
3255330,4,B000YABIQ6,"I was hesitant to write a review--after all, there are already so many.  Yet, I found myself so thoroughly enjoying this show that I couldn't resist adding my 2 cents.

I had heard that the show took place in the 60's and was a fairly accurate account of life then--reflecting on business, the attitudes of men, the place of women, the homogenous business world.  None of which sounded like I would enjoy the show.  And yet, it came with such high praises that i was very compelled to  at least give it a try.

And I am glad I did.  Yes, it was a bigoted time.  Men treated women in a way that i find less than desirable.  Some women behaved in a way that diminished themselves just as much as the men diminished them.  But I found it almost comical--making it so glaringly obvious that the attitudes and behaviors were not the highest of human potential.  It actually reminds me of the way I feel about All in the Family--all in the family was a bigoted show that I think was really making fun of bigotry rather than promoting it.

The story also makes me reflect on my own life--how am i influenced by media?  how do i diminish myself?  But better than all of the reflection that I find myself doing--I enjoy the humor and great story line as well.

And also to specifically speak of the product and not just the series--I love that this has an auto play feature on the disc.  I know it sounds like  a minor thing--but i like the ability to just press auto play and it plays all the episodes on the disc rather than you having to go back to the main menu after each show and selecting the next one. The extras found on the DVD include interviews and commentaries, photos, and other things.  I didn't purchase this for the extras.  If i had to pick an extra that i enjoyed was the music.  Other than that, I prefer not to spend too much time on the extras.

I would have to agree with other reviewers and the media hype--that this is one of the best shows on tv.  although i do have others that i consider better--this is still up there as a must see.",1262995200,,2052,4.248062015503876

3255363,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is the best kept secret on TV.

This is a show that results in sensory overload. It is a look back to a time in our nation's history that is both melancholy and reprehensible at the same time.  It shows that the 50's and early 60's weren't as simple as those of us old enough tend to wax about. To the contrary it was a time when everyone smoked, men wore hats, women lived in corsets and girdles, and alcohol was consumed as if it was water.

Ye t it was also a time of change. A period when minorities were just beginning to be treated as ""real humans"" and women were trying to be viewed as equals.

3255372,4,B000YABIQ6,"I have now re-watched Mad Men, Season One, a number of times and my opinion of it has improved, though I still find the lead characters, Don and Betty Draper, to be insufferable.  He's a cad, a liar, a jerk, an egomaniac, totally devoid of humor and not very bright into the bargain.  Betty is an empty-headed, selfish, childish, vindictive bitch, and she's not a very good mother, either.  The actress playing her should be booted from SAG.  She should at least be given elocution lessons and taught how to pronounce contracted words, like 'wouldn't', 'shouldn't' and 'didn't'  which, from her pouting little lips come out, 'wunt' 'shunt' and 'dint'.

Regardless, I am hooked on Mad Men!  Though it is still impossible to believe that Peggy Olson did not know she was pregnant until she gives birth!  Don's history is also a stretch but his secret hillbilly background lays the foundations for some depth in his story.

I have purchased the subsequent seasons (2 & 3) and await Season 4's release on dvd.  I don't have cable or satellite, not just for one show worth watching, so I have to wait with bated breath.  The series got much better after Season 1.

Mad Men is like an evil Dick Van Dyke show.  It's often very funny and the characters, beyond the Draper couple, are well-drawn and complex.  There is some fine acting by Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson) and Vincent Kartheiser (Peter Campbell).
And I love Joan Holloway played by Christina Hendricks.

Recommended, but the kids probably won't liked it.  It's adult drama and is full (too full) of Don's boring sexual exploits.
I hope they tone that down eventually, it's getting really boring, all that closely-miked lip-smacking and heavy breathing is too adolescent for a show of this quality.",1259020800,6,1751,4.806020066889632

Yes, I am consumed by the world, the writing, the look and the characters in ""Mad Men"" and I believe that creator Matthew Weiner's program will go down in television history as
one of the best ever.

One of the hallmarks of the show, is the articulate, clever and erudite dialogue spoken by the characters.

That is why it rankles and annoys me that the word ""amazing"" is used ad nauseum throughout the audio narrations.  It is spoken by Weiner, in such sentences as ""Look at this outfit. So amazing"". Or by a director, ""This actor, his performance is so amazing."" Or an actor, ""The writing is so amazing.""  Or when speaking about a cinematographer: ""His camera work is amazing.""  The paucity, degradation and vapidity of the English language, as it spoken in 2008 (when the DVD was produced) contrasts so vividly and poorly with the higher intelligence of speech that once came off the lips of English speaking men and women in the early 1960's.

But despite the ever odious presence of the word ""amazing"" there is quite enough in this DVD to satisfy the most crazed MAD MEN fan.",1257120000,,1324,4.632478632478633
3255418,5,B000YABIQ6,"If there's one thing I've learned by watching ""Mad Men"", it's that apparently NO ONE was happy in 1960. The men weren't happy and didn't know how to express it because they had to Be Men, and the women weren't happy because they were expected to be little more than mindless serving women. No one could talk about what they felt or what they really wanted, morality was subjective, and freedom was something you had only if you were a WASP, and even then it was the freedom to ONLY be a WASP and nothing else.

""Mad Men"", as you doubtless know, tells the story of a group of advertising executives at a New York ad firm in 1960. The men, and they're almost all men, are kings of their domain, but are starting to sense the early stirrings of a peasant uprising. It's this - the conflict around the upcoming rise in freedom and equality for gays, women and blacks - that forms the basis of a lot of the most interesting stories in this show.

The acting, directing and cinematography are all suberb. The plots are intelligent and well-written. You'll even pick up a thing or two about advertising!

I hadn't seen this program on TV, nor seen any episodes of it. I bought this DVD set purely on the strength of what I'd heard about it. I was not disapointed. It may not be the best TV show of the last ten years (""Battlestar Galactica"" wins that prize), but's supremely excellent and highly recommended!",1256428800,,1401,4.443579766536965

Since the very first minute I heard about Madmen, I knew I would be hypnotized by this program...NY, 1959, advertising business, women and men oh so elegant...

Not only this show is satisfying for the mind because of the looks, the atmosphere, but also the american society of the fifties, especially relations between men and women, is a character of its own right, if not THE main character of this show.

The first season is a must watch though and really has some of the best acting on television. Visually the show surpasses anything else. It's really a show HBO or Showtime worthy. Why both those big networks passed up on it is insane. AMC really hit a homerun getting this show. Creater and Executive Producer Matthew Weiner has taking some of the best directors and writers from when he was working on The Sopranos and if anybody has seen all seven seasons then you can see the similarities of Mad Men to The Sopranos. Don Draper IS the Tony Soprano of the 1960's just in advertising not organized crime. Season 3 has started up and has revealed some but this show seems to have so many layers its like an onion.

While I love the ambiance of Mad Men, the story itself I find boring.  Certainly the writing is not as crispy as The Sopranos. I watch it for the time travel, not the plot.  Is there a plot?",1252281600,2,739,4.25

Now that I went back I see Season 1, I see why it was rewarded with many accolades and emmys.  TREMENDOUS!  The writing is sharp, original, and the look of the show is unlike anything out there. Beware, the pace of the acting is different from you regular network drama, so be very aware. But, that's what I love about it.

3255519,2,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men has surface style, elegance, and enough attention to period fashion, decor, and (low) technology to be a visual feast. It's filmed with cinematic sensibilities (the opening sequence borrows from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""). The actors are fascinating to look at: they seem to have been chosen based on what was considered movie style beauty fifty years ago. There is enough attention to detail to make merely WATCHING the background sets interesting (I found myself pausing at several points to appreciate the rooms, furniture, wall hangings, and prehistoric office equipment (watching this show is a good way to discover atomic age style and design). All this is interesting--to a point. But the scripts are nothing more than adult soap operas. Unhappy housewives, cheating husbands, men with dark pasts. None of this adds up to much more than what you can get from a daytime soap opera. The fact that more money (a lot more money) and research went into this doesn't redeem it from what it really and truly is: a soap opera. None of the character's tribulations add up to much in the end. And the writers wasted a golden opportunity to say something significant about the time period. Rather than exploit that, they simply threw the same trash into a different era. Watch a few episodes, monitor your boredom, and then move on to something more interesting when you get tired of seeing one more cigarette being put out in one more atomic age ashtray.

There's a difference, people. Every episode is like a game of ""guess what I'm thinking"". Characters say and do seemingly random things, often wildly out of character--but we don't get to know why, we can only watch as the camera zooms in on them contorting their faces, not saying anything because ""that's how it was back then"".

3255553,5,B000YABIQ6,"A surprising American series indeed. And yet it is fascinating. Nostalgia first. 1960 with the duel between Nixon and Kennedy. It is amazing to recapture these old pictures and these old events, and the reactions of some people to the events that were going to become historical if not frankly historic. Nostalgia too with the presence, excessive presence, total submersion if not flood of tobacco smoke in these episodes. I defy you to just feel like following them and chain, double chain, triple chain smoke the way they do. They kiss and smoke at the same time, smoking through their nostrils or their ears I guess. Was there a place where we could not smoke in those days? I don't even remember a non-smoking area, except maybe on trains, one compartment per carriage, when there were compartments. Smoke detectors were not trendy yet. Still  nostalgic but in another style and direction with the Korean war, but in a dramatic way: a lieutenant being killed and his identity assumed by the only witness, a simple soldier from nowhere who volunteered in the war to escape his own family he hated completely and utterly. The film is cruel about this episode, and yet the man is a success story on the basis of a college diploma he never passed, but who cares? No one of course. No deserting, no real criminal act, except the exchange of a dog tag with a dead officer. But then the nostalgia is quite tempered by the insight the other questions that are evoked here bring about some further evolution in society. The main and central problem is that of women. These women who were supposed to be beautiful to just find a husband through some work, at times, but not too much, then make two children, a boy and a girl if possible, and take care of the family home without letting any stranger cross the threshold. Those who worked real hard were not envisaging a housewife career but rather a plain career, be it social, economic, artistic or whatever. They were the new postwar generations of women who decided that the housewife fate was not for them, and anyway the economy required them to work and the incomes of workers and the new needs and consuming possibilities required a second income in the home. Here the film is quite clear about the motivations of women, of working women as well as of housewives. They want to have their say in things, their independence in life, the recognition of their personality and identity. The series is cruel though at times, but so true. Cruel with these housewives who are so bored that they waste their time on checking the phone calls of their husbands, and finding out about their affairs, the good old western Christian or Jewish polygamy. Cruel about the women who use their sex appeal or their yielding to the sexual appetite of the men around them just for their vanity and to have some small presents and advantages, like a canary in a cage. Cruel when a woman gets some authority over another woman and over-uses it, abuses it and even abuses the girl or woman she is supposed to take care of. But the worst cruelty is against all the macho phallocratic men who behave with women as if they were servants, subservient, as if they had to be crawling at their feet and obsequiously submissive. The men are odious, purely idiotic, blind but also conscious at times that something was evading and escaping them, that women, married or not, wives or not, Jewish or not, were taking over the territory that was becoming theirs, the family, their desk space, their waste paper basket, their box in the personnel lounge, etc. We just wonder if things were really like that and we have to remember that yes they were and yes they were changing in that direction. The last thing I would like to say on that series, I mean the first season of that series, is that there is a lot of humor nearly everywhere, and at times, quite often indeed, sad humor, but humor all the same like about the Jews who are still ghettoized, or a lesbian woman who is nicely diplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it. We are still in 1960 and Kennedy has not been elected yet and the real battle about civil rights is just starting in a way, for the Blacks. The Jews are maybe slightly different, but the gay and lesbian people are far from the beginning of the decision to just open the door of the closet one inch to see if there is anyone in there. I must admit it is good to look back, not in anger but in shame and in gratefulness, at times that have changed in this period that was just the very first step towards real freedom in our countries, and we are still far from the fulfillment of Roosevelt's promise about the four freedoms. By the way, what about the freedom from want in the healthcare field of poverty and misery, what about top notch surgery for a coronary accident of a homeless person?

3255554,3,B000YABIQ6,"I have heard people rave about this show and how smartly written it is, and how well it captures the atmosphere of the 1960s. It doesn't. It captures the LOOK of the '60s brilliantly, but otherwise, it's a caricature of that era. EVERY male character is a despicable, philandering, sexist pig who leads a pathetically empty life devoid of real meaning. Every suburban scene positively drips with the implication that these people all live utterly superficial, meaningless, shallow, phony lives, wearing polite smiles that they show each other, even as they connive and gossip maliciously behind each others' backs. And no one, but NO ONE is actually happy.  Every man and woman walks through life like a robot, doing what's expected and appropriate, and all secretly unhappy and unfulfilled.  There are no characters who really like their jobs, no husbands and fathers who truly love their wives and children, no wives who are genuinely happy to be raising their kids because they love them and love motherhood, etc.  What we seem to have here is an overreaction to the classic ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" view of life presented in the shows of this era.  If those shows over-sanitized life and presented a too idealized vision of American life, then I think this one goes too far in the other direction, and tries to make life back then look stylish and sharp on the surface, but totally rotten, corrupt, cheap, and ugly underneath.  The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between.

Take a look at how people behave on this show.  While I'm sure sexism and sexual harassment were a bit worse back then, it simply couldn't have been THIS bad. In one scene, in the first episode, one of the young executives looks a new girl up and down like a piece of meat, and then proceeds to offer gratuitous and explicit criticism of her her appearance and advice on how to sex herself up, right to her face. Come on! Sexual harassment was, as I said, probably worse back then, but this is outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.  The same character then asks this girls boss when he can have his turn with her, as though it simply goes without saying that she'll sleep with him; it's just a regular perk that goes along with the job, like having a key to the executive washroom.  Later on, another male character, who hasn't been so crude, spends a little time building rapport with this same girl, and she's glad to meet someone who appears genuinely nice and friendly.  And then the next thing you know, he gets her in an office, locks the door, and tries to start taking her clothes off.  Message loud and clear: he's just like all the rest.  Now really, was there ever a time when ALL men just took it for granted that every attractive woman was available and willing, and any woman who is nice to a guy will just roll onto her back for him at the first opportunity?  I don't think so.

And the writer's portrayal of racism, and classism is every bit as much a caricature as their portrayal of sexism.  This show is stylish, the dialogue is smartly written, the actors' performances are top notch, and the production values are superb.  The show recaptures the appearance of the early 1960s brilliantly.  But the treatment of how people lived and worked and acted is not nearly so well done.",1250899200,6,3382,4.647651006711409

The show is slow, horribly acted by stiff and uninteresting characters, and absolutely nothing of consequence happened during the entire first season.

3255561,5,B000YABIQ6,"AMC's much-acclaimed Mad Men is a sterling example of how primetime television has evolved recently. While past television shows were dull visually and inert dramatically, particularly when compared to film, top-tier shows now display a sophistication that I would've thought impossible a decade back. While much has been made of the detail and authenticity (or lack thereof) of the early 60s setting, the specific locale (an Advertising Agency, Sterling Cooper, on Madison avenue) is equally intriguing. Though dramatic shows generally demand exciting professions (police, law or medical), the seemingly dull field of advertising is a brilliantly appropriate backdrop for an examination of the intricacies and drama of day to day life. As Mad Men repeatedly demonstrates, advertising is not about what is on the surface, but instead draws out that which was once inside, revealing that which no one, perhaps even the individual who is being exposed, was aware of.

Though Mad Men boasts an impressively large ensemble cast, the first season focuses primarily on a few central figures. At the heart of the show is creative department head Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the contradictory protagonist and already one of the most compelling characters on television. Though often amoral, Draper still embodies a masculine ideal: he is smart, cynical, ultra-competent and largely indifferent to social expectations. (Not to mention improbably handsome, but in a masculine, un-feminized way.) Draper is not without a core of vulnerability, but this only serves to give his strengths more weight. We also follow Draper's homelife, including his neurotic, vaguely unsatisfied wife Betty (January Jones) and their two young children. (Whom Don obviously loves, making his frequent neglect and betrayal all the more puzzling.) As a foil to Draper we have Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), a well-born and entitled junior executive who imagines himself heir to Draper's throne. Finally we have Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), a new secretary and eventual copy writer who is largely (though not entirely) separate from the cutthroat ethos of the office, and who often serves as an audience stand in. The cast of secondary characters (not that I've even covered all the major ones) is too large to really consider here, though the ensemble portrays them all with skill. The sheer size is perhaps a minor weakness initially, as it takes a long time for the average viewer to even remember who is who, and even longer for the characters to be developed. Nevertheless, it is worth the wait and effort.

The story is equally difficult to define, with the show taking an organic approach, juggling numerous different subplots without necessarily resolving them fully. The overarching threads could loosely be defined as the fate of Sterling Cooper generally (they're a small agency with, shall we say, erratic and unreliable leadership) and the uncovering of Don Draper's history. (He rarely talks about it, and with good reason . . .)  While the hedonistic lifestyle at the office is always substantial, I find the business angle particularly intriguing, with the show examining the underlying logic behind many real world ad campaigns. (These elements also give Draper a chance to cynically philosophize, which is always a treat.)

Though the intriguing storytelling soon takes hold, the new viewer will must likely first note the shows extraordinary visuals. While we don't typically think of eras that still hang on common memory as being fodder for period-piece detail, Mad Men recreates the dawn of the 60s with all the care that a high budget film would give to any pre-modern era. (Truthfully, I couldn't say if the visualization is utterly accurate, but the totality of the vision is certain.) Relatedly, Mad Men's depiction of older social mores has been the major source of both praise and controversy. Though a fairly socially conservative individual myself (outlandish tastes notwithstanding), I can't help but feel the more old-fashioned critics are missing something. Intentionally or not, Mad Men works as an antidote to the laughably superficial views of the era promoted by tedious productions like Sam Mendes' adaptation of ""Revolutionary Road."" Modern liberals like to pretend that social conservatism and conformity were the cause of all middle class misery prior to the 60s, but is anyone foolish enough to believe that Don or Pete or Betty would be totally content if they'd been after the blessed 60s? Though there are plenty of ""oh my god look at how terrible people were in 1960"" moments, Mad Men is ultimately just cynical, certain that there is only so much we can do to rein in human weakness. (Note how the beats and self righteous proto-hippies are portrayed in a less than glowing light, and are verbally eviscerated by Draper.) The validity of this perspective can be debated, but it's not quite the same as simple permissiveness. (I'd also say that the show's values are fundamentally bourgeois, though that's a debate too tiresome and lengthy to consider here.)

In the end, most great art or entertainment is defined by the nebulous core of humanity that is absent from mediocre works. Even though the characters often behave reprehensibly, an attachment gradually develops. This culminates in sorrowful season finale, where we see the initially overly vain and unsympathetic Betty breakdown in front of the weird neighbor child over the state of her marriage and life, desperately asking for this prepubescent boy to tell her everything will be okay. Even better is Don's nostalgia pitch for the carousel slide projector, where he illustrates the notion with a brief speech given over a series of photos from the happier times of his family's checkered past, and his always impassive face blanches and glazes over just so slightly with restrained emotion. Rationally, neither Don nor Betty is worthy of all that much sympathy, but here reason no longer applies. By the end of the first season, Mad Men has reached that magical point where the fictional figures mean more to the viewer than such non-existent figures have any right to. This is another rarity on TV, and an accomplishment that more than offsets whatever minor flaws the show may have.",1250380800,,6262,5.189910979228487
3255612,5,B000YABIQ6,"I still find it hard to beleive that HBO passed on this series, since they have had some of the best television shows in recent memory, incuding Oz, Entourage, Six Feet Under and of course the Sopranos.  I think I orginally heard of this because of that happening and decided to pick this up to see what HBO missed.

Mad Men is about the 1960s and you feel like you are there, with all the nuances of the times that are not here, rightly or wrongly, here today.  The drinking and smoking that was so prevalent of the times ( I vauguely recall similar things happening from when I was a child, though it was alot later than this series, but were still relatviely social norms at the time.)

It is all Father Knows Best pushed into reality, where the men were the bread winners and the woman stayed home or were relgated to less meaningful jobs.  The things that are often subject to the internet emails you get along the lines of ""How Did People Survive?""  (i.e., smoking, drinking, no seat bet type emails) permeates the entire show and there is the sense of how did people get by like that when we look at it today.  Not as an indictment, but more as that was then and not now.

Very well filmed and written.  Matthew Weiner's touch is still as strong as ever.

3255613,5,B000YABIQ6,"I recently watched clips of Mad Men on Hulu.  I found it very interesting and when Amazon had a sale, I bought Season 1.  I have now just finished a marathon session of watching Season 1, and this show blew me away!!  I only intended to watch a couple of episodes, but got so caught up in it, that I spent the entire day watching all 13 episodes.  I don't know how true the show is to Madison Avenue, but there is no political correctness here--the attitudes expressed on the show, while totally unacceptable today, all feel true and believable for the setting and time period.  It was shocking to see a pregnant woman drinking and smoking (because they did that then) and other things shown on the show.  I'm glad that most of those things are not done today, but know that people did act that way then.  The direction, sets, crisp dialogue, and depth of talent of the ensemble cast, most of whom I was unfamiliar with, are all incredible.  The only casting quibble I had was with the actor who portrayed the much younger ""little"" brother of Don Draper, who just looked and felt wrong to me.  He looked as old or older than Don.

In those episodes you find disillusioned middle-aged executives of the early 1960s who feel the passaage of time, sense that the next generation is on their heels and who are hoping for an exit.  Add in some Serling-esque chain smoking, which is era appropriate of course.  It might just be convergent story evolution. I mean why write about happy middle aged executives in the early 60s, right?  But it could be that he's a Serling fan.

3255615,2,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is one of those historical TV shows which is fun to look at, but has almost no historical verity to it, sort of like Rome. It's not abysmally bad; sort of like Rome. You can watch it, and it's kind of fun for the soap operatics, and for what it reveals about the writers and people who watch it. It gets a lot of small physical details mostly right, which sort of magically transport you to the era of my parents photo albums. The ugly furnishings. The narrow lapel suits. Greasy haircuts. The dumb skinny ties. The fact that everyone chain smokes, and people drink at work and everywhere else, all the time. The glasses frames which make all the women look like nerds. That sort of detailed superficial appearances is what the entertainment industry has done right for the last 20 years or so; in fact, it's the only thing they've done right for the last 20 years or so. Of course, they're about 5 years off on some of the looks, but whatever; close enough. Another achievement, seemingly unique in the recent annals of television: some of the women actually look female. Of course, there are a bunch of hilarious anachronisms: beyond the non 1961 era suits and dresses ... everyone on this show sports an accent which didn't exist until around 1980 or so.

It has a lot of fun at the expense of advertising. I find this amusingly ironic, as most people who watch this sort of show work in similarly vapid ""creative"" endeavors involving selling underpants on the internet, or doing the same thing on an interpersonal level using some silly variety of psychotherapy or whatnot. It genuflects at the false god of the counterculture; making dumb nihilist beatniks out to be somehow in on a secret that the ad men can't fathom, when in reality, all they really have on him is an inferior drug stash; booze and smokes, after all, were the background relaxants of America's greatest years. Real beatniks made the imaginary misogyny of ""Mad Men"" seem like small beer. Think I'm making some kind of unfounded assertion here? Go find me a single mainstream work of literature as insanely misogynistic as Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" which treats women as animated cadavers. You can't do it, therefore I win.

One of the amusing things about this show is how wrong it gets morals and folkways. While I'm sure there was plenty of sexism and seducing of coworkers in the early 1960s (since there is plenty of both now), the idea that it was a time of utter crudity, casual race hatred, extreme classism and a male conspiracy to keep women down is transparently absurd. The people who were alive in those days are still alive. I'm related to some of them; life didn't work that way at all. People were pretty much the same as they are now, except instead of being sanctimonious about not being a racist or recycling or whatever meaningless moral absurdity they're able to come up with, they just had good manners, which actually works better. Classism was exactly the same then as it is now, and a lot more subtle than, ""I had to assume an officer's identity to make my way in the world."" By the way, the main character's class schtique is hilarious, because it's what every SWPL ding dong from the suburbs thinks about himself; that he escaped some horrible past and family trauma in the suburbs for the high privilege of living near ""artistic"" people. The idea that housewives led some kind of bizarro life of suburban alienation while their evil husbands were off sleeping with everyone is ... well, mathematically impossible. Think about it for a minute. Who are their husbands off rogering? If you believe the premise of this program, there are 4-5 women for every men. While such a world would be a nice place for me to live in, it doesn't have much to do with reality.

Still it's kind of fun to watch, in the same way Archie Bunker was fun to watch. As someone else put it, it's kind of like Halo night in a 21st century frat house. I'm not watching it for the cheap sanctimony; I'm watching it for the sleazy gropings, high office drama, the female looking women and drinking of enormous quantities of booze. Plus, everyone smokes; most TV has entirely not enough smoking. Bonus: it's a great exposition of 21st century American upper middle class neuroses about the past. The sanctimony about ""the way we really weren't so much,"" can be irritating if you let it, or you can laugh at it's idiocy and make drinking games every time someone acts in a way designed to elicit modern priggishness.

""Mad Men"" is a period piece; the period portrayed being the advertising world of New York in the early 19060's. Like any good period piece, the costumes, sets, tone, etc. are all faithful to the time period which it is supposed to be set (as far as I can tell). However, also like any good period piece, the characters, fleshed out and fully human, show that no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.

The characters in ""Mad Men"" are all playing the hands they've been dealt. It's entertaining to watch the men of agency Sterling-Cooper enjoying the privileges of being white, male, and professional at the time: at the office they smoke like chimneys, drink like fish, and are free to sexually harass the hell out of every female in the vicinity. However, the series quickly goes beneath that surface to show the complexity behind that seemingly chauvinistic situation. Many of the men, despite all their bravado, are mostly frightened babies, often buckling under the pressures of professional and family life. And many of the women, although seemingly submissive, expertly manipulate their situations to their advantage. Nothing is ever quite as it seems.

Even when it ventures into sensationalistic territory, ""Mad Men"" always maintains an air of dignity that keeps it from devolving into the sad state of many ""edgy"" cable shows, where the need to shock is constantly overpowering the need for believable character development. I'm hoping that the series continues to take the high road and continue to develop these fascinating characters for years to come.",1248393600,,1749,4.922033898305084

(And recommended by four out of five dentists)

There are definitely moments of real glory here, mainly from Hamm, who really brings home the bacon. He sells the sizzle and the steak as well. The rest of the cast is quite fine but he carries this puppy and does a very good job, showing far more depth than is common in tv acting.

Nonetheless, this show has Six Feet Under-itis: it comes out of the gate at a full gallop in the pilot and then slowly loses steam, until by the end of the first season it's still a fine show but has lost the magic of its early moments. It looks technicolor-lush and 50s/60s surreal throughout, though, to its great credit. Big props to the art designers on MadMen; it's as slick as its subject.

Matt Weiner writes some gorgeous lines (""He'd rather be a whiner than a weener?"" said the missus when he said his name on the commentary), and there are occasional moments of extreme lucidity regarding the America dream. For that alone this series deserves serious praise. That it slowly floats into soap opera-ish territory is unfortunate but mildly inevitable; series that start this strong and never fade are few indeed.

But those first few shows are tremendous, and this is in general many cuts above the norm; I'll take whatever knowing irony I can get these days, as the oblivious irony is endemic. Brutally honest revisionist history is a rare thing on American television and is always praiseworthy, especially when done with such loving care.",1248048000,4,1492,4.683206106870229

3255620,5,B000YABIQ6,"I am not a fan of modern television. Most shows cater to the lowest common denominator or have storylines that go no where. This is the opposite!

The show centers around an ad man, Don Draper, who struggles with his past and is actually a coward. He cheats and lies on his wife, rejects his own brother...yet you pull for him. The show also follows Don's new secretary, Peggy, who has an affair with an account exec, Pete. Pete is absolutely a rotten man who plays the perfect anti-Don.

The show is visually stunning and has that modern 60's feel which gives you the impression of Leave It To Beaver but the dialogue is anything but. One wonders how men got away with what they said/did but the women were just as bad. You will feel bonds with the characters and you will care about their fates.

3255650,3,B000YABIQ6,"I think this show is very well produced and it's premise and setting is promising, but it's not a patch on the quality of a program like 'The Sopranos', from where it's creator Matt Weiner hails as a writer. I was initially disappointed in the 'stylized' performances in Mad Men as, in the wake of the Sopranos, I found the prospect of a realistically performed collection of early sixties characters very exciting. Unfortunately, despite the darker themes of the program, it is really a series of TV performances (ie the way we imagine 1960's characters to behave via our experience of their television). Thus there is no cursing, no genuine intimacy and a strange contrivance about all involved. It's a shame, especially when you can see a film like 'Revolutionary Road' pulling off just the sort of honesty and performance style that we might hope for from Mad Men. Other than that the program suffers from strangely judgmental moments, and others cloyingly obvious and Spielberg-esque. The Sopranos was never guilty of either of these crimes.

For judging, take the 'easy' criticism of the hippie characters that Draper visits (and dowses them with the predictable 'Get a job' criticism) - actually some of their criticisms of Draper were very interesting but they were marred by obvious, cliched portrayals of hippies. If Draper had've witnessed a Dylan concert in the Village or something nearing it's quality, he might have felt very inferior indeed. As it is, he has to sit through poetry so bad, only a cynical scriptwriter could've prepared it.

For cloying, witness the awful flashbacks to Draper's childhood, portrayed with such obvious message-mongering they border on condescension of the audience. Yes, we get it, Draper's dad was a 'bad man'. The most obvious shortfall of the program is it's inability to deliver us genuinely sympathetic and involving characters. The closest are Peggy and Draper's wife - but even they are basically shallow puppets caught up in the oh so important world of advertising. The show has two big things going for it; It's early 60's style is fresh and it has learned from The Sopranos that unpredictability is a compelling way to explore an ensemble cast. Other than that, time will get the better of this program.",1245974400,4,2261,4.994694960212201
3255651,3,B000YABIQ6,"After the 5th episode, I was beginning to think that I needed a drink.  Maybe if I was drunk I'd give this series 5 stars.  No wonder these people drank and smoked their brains out...their lives were so dull.  ""Madmen"" is not an exciting piece of work but a nice showcase of the 60s advertising industry and how it influenced and shaped American culture and consumerism. The script, art direction, and acting are intelligently well crafted and depict the facade of the era well. Unfortunately, most of the characters are still forgettable although the character development is obvious throughout. Plus, each episode drags and the delivery couldn't get any less climactic.  It took 10 episodes for me to finally get ""hooked"".  The story material is very dense and dry at times.  This series can't be easily watched in one sitting like others.  There are very subtle details that I think the average viewer would have a hard time noticing, let alone appreciating.  ""Madmen"" isn't for the average viewer of course.  For me, it was like watching a college sociology thesis put on film.  I found it fascinating and educational but mildly entertaining.  There's enough wit in the dialog that kept me interested.  Episode 9 is by far my favorite.  Worth a look to feed a itching curiosity of the 60s or for those who are looking for a show that is unique and insightful.",1245801600,4,1363,4.773504273504273

3255697,5,B000YABIQ6,"I don't want to repeat all the good reviews, because they are all true and this is a singularly great series and blah blah.

What I wasn't expecting from Mad Men was a meditation on existentialism and how close America flirted with nothingness while ""having it all"". Everyone in the series does what they think they should do, play the roles they think they should play with glee, all while being worried sick that underneath there is pain, unhappiness and baseness, and not much else.

 ""The universe is indifferent"", Don Draper says at one point, coalescing the characters' reaction to the void. Fill it up with instinctive desires and lust for dominance and power and get away with as much as you can. Meanwhile, they live with and romance complete strangers, and immerse themselves in their pre-cut roles while trying to avoid the unseen force that drives their behavior. When calamity strikes these souls, granite shells are exploded and inside there are often scared little children who are ill-equipped to deal with real life and real emotions that they are secretly victims of.

Mad Men shows people doing what's expected of them without bothering to do what they are supposed to do-on Madison Avenue, near the heights of success, as the opening of each episode shows, it's a long way down to the annihilation of everything they are, and a long time to think about it in descent.",1236988800,2,1387,4.815126050420168

Mad Men works on so many different levels because it combines both the traditional drama setting of work out and out work settings and conflicts with realistic and sympathetic people. Mad Men excels at showing the flaws at its protagonists while not making them out to be pure evil.  The Don Draper character is so well formed he seems ready to jump off the screen. Pete Campbell is the evil little weasel every show must have, yet he is also someone with a touch of humanity showing that while Mad Men is to a certain degree soapy it is not a classic soap opera.

3255901,3,B000YABIQ6,"In America there was a thing called the culture wars. The right said that up till the sixties things had been going well. The family unit was solid and because it was solid the nation was solid. The key to keeping the family together was strict sexual morality, the acceptance of woman as a home maker and the importance of raising children with strong values. If children had values they did not break the law, worked hard and society prospered.

Along came the sixties and women had conflicting roles. Morality fell apart and the divorce rate went through roof. Single familles were thrown into poverty and crime became rampant. The culture war was an attack on the changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century which saw the emancipation of woman, ending laws against homosexuality and the development of governmental roles to improve society.

This series appears to be a strong counter attack against the right suggesting a new model of what the fifties were like. It suggests that the developments in the sixties were against a society of the fifties seeped in racism, homophobia and misogyny.

Part of the appeal of the series seems to be a smug satisfaction by the viewer of how much things are better now and what repellent creeps are portrayed in the show. On a superficial level the characters smoke constantly, drink to excess and eat food drenched in dairy products. Anyone seeing the show now would realise that this sort of behaviour would lead to a life expectancy of about fifty. The male characters are white and who despise Jews. Any contact with women is predatory.

And of course there is some truth in the picture. If you want women to not have sexual contact prior to marriage and not to engage in affairs there must be strong social prohibitions in place. Whilst the fifties might have seen lower rates of pre-marital sex it was a period when terms such as ""slut"", ""mole"" and ""whore"" were not only in use but could be used to achieve social exclusion. A society which has ""strong morality"" is a society which is intolerant, judgemental and exclusive.

The major problem with the show is not so much the politics it espouses. Rather it is rather slow moving. One is not so much interested in the development of the story. Rather it is like watching a train wreck. It is a bit repellent but you feel compelled to watch it never the less.",1228348800,4,2376,4.6746411483253585

Everyone smokes almost all of the time in every scene, they enjoy five martini lunches, and doting wives wait at home for their husbands with a roast in the oven.

3255906,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is an absolute masterpiece. I agree 200% with all the rave reviews here.

I'm not going to add to the ample reviews of this show. Instead, I would like to comment on the generous extras included in the DVD set.

I debated a long time before buying the DVDs since I own the season on iTunes. I'm glad I bought the DVDs -- the commentaries and extras make it worth every penny.

Each episode has at least one commentary track, usually two separate commentary tracks. And there are other extras - a 20-minute piece, ""Advertising the American Dream"", a 10-minute video on scoring Mad Men, and the hour-long 'Establishing Mad Men'--all excellent.

A word about the commentaries -- the ones by creator and writer Matt Weiner are superb, very insightful and interesting. I haven't listened to all the other commentaries yet. Of the ones I have listened to, Weiner's are definitely the best, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones, and Jon Hamm also provide interesting depth. The brilliant costume designer Janie Bryant also provides wonderful commentary.

I wish some of the other commentaries had been edited, though. For instance, in Jon Hamm's, January Jones', and Elizabeth Moss' commentary on the last episode, 'The Wheel', Elizabeth Moss' comments on the padding used to show her weight gain. This is an interesting aside, but Moss' commentary goes on far too long and it's all trivial, with no insights into Peggy's character. She repeats the same stories again and again--for well over 10 minutes. Her commentary drones through an important part of the Draper story (Don looking at old photos of his brother). It's a shame that we miss Hamm's commentary during that emotionally moving portion of the episode.

But that's my only criticism, one small quibble. The DVD set is marvelous and if you're a Mad Men fan it will add substantially to your enjoyment and insight into the show.",1227830400,3,1887,4.918238993710692
3255947,3,B000YABIQ6,"I was really looking forward to this series after reading the rave reviews but I have to say I was disappointed by this tepid view of the heyday of advertising.  The series certainly scores high style marks but substance is woefully lacking in this rather narcissistic view of 1960 Madison Avenue.  Once past the good looks, crisp lines and jaunty banter, I found myself wondering ""where's the beef?""  The directors seem to revel in this decidedly man's world where women seem little more than muses, except for Peggy Olsen who finds herself quickly rising up the ladder with her honest view of products.

The firm of Sterling & Cooper comes across as a sexist bastion during a time when many women were breaking through such barriers.  You get the sense that Peggy is a younger version of Helen Gurley Brown who had worked herself up from the mailroom of the William Morris Agency to become one of the highest paid ad copywriters of the early 60s, eventually taking over Cosmopolitan and turning it into the magazine we know today.  Sexism was pervasive at the time, but this show seems to revel in it, with little sense of irony.

The episodes are painfully slow and Don Draper is painfully boring.  It takes 12 excrutiating episodes to find out about his hidden past, which in the end doesn't appear to make the slightest impact on the story as Cooper dismisses Peter Campbell's revelatory scene out of hand.  Seems Don Draper can do no wrong, although he appears to have an increasingly hard time at home as his lovely wife Betty comes apart at the seams like Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar.

After 12 episodes, I feel like I've had enough, although fans of this series keep telling me how things pick up in season two.  Maybe so, but the first season didn't do much for me.",1227830400,14,1776,4.606349206349206

And yet I can not find one single thing I like about Don Draper. Sure, Jon Hamm is a great actor, and a quite handsome man, but the character is very unlikeable.

4.  The story lines are intriguing, compelling, multi-layered.

There are some story lines that don't interest me: I get up and fold laundry or brush my teeth and floss anytime one of the kids are central to a scene.

What makes Mad Men so great is not just that the writing is incredible, the actors are great, the sets and costumes are so immaculate and colorful, the sense of time is so shocking and so believable. It's that this show transcends what normal television seems to hit--even the ""great"" shows are watchable once, maybe twice before they seem to lose their edge. I've watched several of these episodes three times or more, and the sense of art and space around the characters and their inner psychology is fascinating to watch.

These characters and these plots aren't just about something amazing happening; that's what makes them so special. These are normal, powerful men and women in ideal and slightly-less-than-ideal situations, and many of them have no idea why their lives are falling apart around them.

3256000,5,B000YABIQ6,"For once, I was onboard with a fascinating series right from the get-go.  On a syndicated PBS afternoon interview program called ""Fresh Air,"" someone associated with MAD MEN was the guest.  The host played some audio segments from one of the episodes.  This was radio, so I had only the words and ambient sound to go by.  The intelligence of the dialogue belied the nearly languid cadence of the speech.  This was something very different; very different indeed.

As it turned out, the dialogue I heard was from the very first scene of the very first episode, between Don and the black waiter, the discussion over the Old Gold cigarettes.  What a hook, in retrospect.  That scene sets the tone for all the episodes that follow.  It was a flash of brilliance that Matthew Weiner set his series in an advertising agency in the 1960s, a critical juncture in the social history.  Advertising concerns itself with appearances, associating a product with an image with no regard to its true value.  Meanwhile the characters are suffering beneath the appearance of propriety, with the knowledge that nothing is really as advertised.  There was the IMAGE of American life in stark contrast to the REALITY of American life, with its racism and sexism and everything else that was wrong.  The series is a complete theme with a distinctive visual style.  And that's why the Blu-ray edition is a must-own for any fan of the show.  Where I live, AMC isn't offered in HD, so seeing this series in this format, with all those 60s-era sets and styles, was like seeing it afresh.  It truly enhanced my appreciation, and gave me a good excuse to watch it all over again.

The features are replete with enough to keep you going back for more for a very long time.  Fans of the series will enjoy the revelations from the actors and creative forces via commentaries and documentaries.

3256003,5,B000YABIQ6,"After watching the first few episodes of ""Mad Men"", you can be forgiven if your eyes burn and you start to cough. It might be the only television show in history to cause second-hand smoke. Set in 1960, ""Men Mad"" is really about the 1950's and it captures the spiritual emptiness of the period perfectly. While the Eisenhower era has been romanticized recently as a wonderful time when all Americans had jobs, homes, and cars (and when Republicans were considered ""nice"" people believing in thrift) this fantasy is true only if you were a straight, white male. And a conforming one at that. Still, the emotion that pervades this series is sadness: no one is happy, no matter how many material goodies they have. Even the beatniks are gloomy and dull.

The men survive by chain-smoking, drinking themselves insensible and attempting to seduce anything in a skirt. The women are treated to such casual and pervasive sexism that, viewing ""Mad Men"", even conservative women like Phylliss Schlafly will send Gloria Steinem a fruit basket. The women themselves are either the original ""Desperate Housewives"" or trying to stay sane by manipulating the men who prey on them. People of color exist merely as waiters and elevator operators. In the world of 1960 advertising, they are completely non-existent. You see no ads depicting a black or Hispanic family buying a new car, sharing a beer with friends or ogling a new refrigerator. Nor will you for another decade.

Centering around the advertising executives of the fictional Sterling-Cooper agency (""Mad Men"" is slang for the admen working on Madison Avenue in New York City, the archetypal Men in the Gray Flannel Suits), ""Mad Men"" succeeds more from mood then plot. The action is focused on the nuances of facial expression that speaks louder than words at a time when true self-expression was unknown and unwanted. The plot itself centers on rising adman star Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has a secret past and his relationship with his suppressed wife, Betty (January Jones) who, although in therapy, is treated like a dependent child by her analyst who discusses her case only with her husband, not her. Elisabeth Moss shines as Peggy Olson, Draper's new secretary who is ahead of her time in terms of sexual liberation and professional intelligence. When she finally writes copy for a successful ad campaign (unheard of for the women in the office) she is condescendingly offered a drink, a pat on the back but no pay or no position. She chafes under her treatment and one wonders what the coming of the tumultuous Sixies has in store for her.

Which bring us to the children of the principal characters. All those cute little tykes running around with cowboy hats and cap guns will, within the coming decade, become hippies, anti-war protesters, feminists and environmental activists. Bob Dylan is still a year away from descending upon the scene but if there ever was a time that needed a'changing, it was 1960 America. The Beatles, Vietnam, and Kennedy's assassination are just around the corner but no one at Sterling-Cooper knows this or even has the imagination to envision the cataclysmic changes about to descend upon them. And when they do happen, will they notice or care?",1224633600,2,3233,4.9284403669724774

I generally watch things at random and don't watch a lot of shows consistently.  This is a show worth changing that for.  It's hard to describe what makes this show such a rare event in TV.  Somebody had the vision to put a show on TV that has something to say and is as raw, honest and true to the period it is based on.  I, for one, am grateful for that.

The show centers on the NY advertising world of the 1960s. Why ""Mad Men?""  The old row of famous agencies on Madison Avenue, of course.  The men are sexist, rude, slicked up, and well dressed. The women are submissive yet cunning, half accepting sexism and half ignoring it.

There's not a lot of political correctness here.  That is bound to offend some.  While my first reaction was to wonder as to the motives behind that, the truth is that after watching the show for a few episodes it becomes clear that the bigotry of the period is key to understanding the characters.  Plenty that the characters say would get them fired today. For their era, sexist banter in the office was considered par for the course.

There's also plenty of smoking, drinking and sexual situations.  If you are very conservative this might not be for you.  Yet even conservative people would have to warm up somewhat to the effectiveness of the portrayal. This show makes you believe you are witnessing things as they were. Not having been there, we can't know for sure.  Regardless, this sure is convincing.

There are some nice special features and extras sprinkled sparingly throughout the disks.  Of course you have your usual commentary tracks on the episodes, which are actually worth listing to in my opinion.  Not every show can say that.

The behind-the-scenes documentary section is also standard fare, but well done. It covers the basic elements of how the show is put together, from characters, sets, makeup, wardrobes, and art design. You also get some small extras that are nice like a segment on scoring the music for the show, which is great, and audio clips of some of the period songs that are used.

Because of the way the disks are set up, many of these specific extras are on the individual disks.  So you have to search for them. Also, there are only a few episodes per disk (about 3).  I guess those extras and commentary tracks took up a lot of disk space.  Still, these are minor details.

Conclusion

This is a great show and well worth watching again and again.  I hope you will check this out if you haven't already.

3256052,4,B000YABIQ6,"Standing out against a backdrop containing a depressing number of boring sitcoms, brain-dead reality shows, and interchangeable law-enforcment procedurals, Mad Men is the kind of show that's been hastening my abandonment of network TV over the past several years.  Chronicling a year (roughly) in the life of Madison Avenue ad agency Sterling Cooper, Mad Men enfolds an unapologetic look at early-1960's American society into an intelligent and occasionally comedic drama series.  While the massive buzz might suggest otherwise, Mad Men is not in fact the best thing to happen to TV since color--the pacing could use some work, and the dialogue isn't always as clever or profound as it's obviously meant to be--but it's still nice to see a show this unabashedly cool and thoroughly absorbing.  Largely forgoing contrived plot twists and tiresome histrionics, the show instead breezes by on its unforced charm and subtle character dynamics.  Much has been made of the Mad Men's exacting recreation of a bygone era, and that attention to detail spills into every aspect of the show, giving it a colorful, vivid look and feel unlike anything else on TV.  Even when the characters aren't doing anything consequential, as in a late-season episode showing the staff killing time during the presidential election with the bosses gone, it's a blast just to watch them hang out.

Like many of the best shows of the past decade or so (think The Shield, The Wire, The Sopranos, etc.), Mad Men manages to juggle multiple plot and character arcs, generally bringing things along slowly until the pace accelerates in the wrenching final few episodes.  At the same time, its novel setting in the early 1960's and its high levels of personal, professional ,and sexual intrigue ensure that it manages to stand on its own as a compelling watch.  Especially fascinating is seeing the freewheeling portrayal of behaviors now considered archaic if not outright evil: rampant adultery and sexist objectification, smoking (even during pregnancy!), drunk driving, and, in one strangely alluring scene, the main character's mega-babe wife shooting the neighbor's birds in her backyard while puffing away on a cigarette.  Even though the show depicts a great deal of what would now be considered misbehavior, it never passes judgment on its characters or their era, nor does it engage in pointless nostalgia.  It just presents likeably flawed characters living by the conventions of a different time and leaves viewers to judge for themselves.

While Mad Men does an admirable job of developing a sizeable ensemble cast(which has continued in its even better second season), there's no question that the central character in the drama is Don Draper, Sterling Cooper's vaguely mysterious creative director.  Played in career-making fashion by the suitably stoic and square-jawed Jon Hamm, Don is easily one of the most unpredictable and inscrutable leading men on TV, not quite a hero and not quite an anti-hero, but a compelling figure nonetheless.  My wife succintly described him as a ""jerk,"" and while that label isn't entirely inaccurate, the writers gradually fill in the details of Don's past and reveal what's going on beneath his seemingly soulless exterior.  Even as he drinks heavily, cheats on his wife, and belittles subordinates, it's somehow easy to forgive Don his flaws, especially as the season wears on and the writers take us further into his head.  Similarly, a collection of (somewhat) ancillary characters who may intially seem one-note--reserved secretary Peggy Olsen, hard-living boss Roger Sterling, Machiavellian striver Pete Campbell, seductive office manager Joan Holloway--have their own aspirations and internal conflicts come out over time.

Mixing single-episode plots with longer storylines, along with the running thread of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential race (with Sterling Cooper working for Nixon), Mad Men has a lot going on from the very first episode.  For a show as busy and ambitious as it is, though, Mad Men remains extremely restrained and consistent, with few deviations from its focus on character and setting.  I for one found the plots focusing on Don's home life and his romantic entanglements less interesting than the show's examination of the workings of a business circa 1960 and the psychological underpinnings of advertising, but pretty much everyone should be able to find something here to enjoy.  Throughout its first season Mad Men keeps the complexity level high and rarely panders to its audience, which are qualities that just about everyone should be able to get behind.",1222992000,2,4608,5.270491803278689

3256055,5,B000YABIQ6,"MAD MEN is one of those series that is almost impossible to praise too highly.  It is also one of those series that puts on display the inherent superiority of television to the movies.  That is a sentiment that I find offends many, but one that more and more thinking men and women are coming to embrace as television gradually turns out one amazingly intelligent series after another.  Cinema is inherently limited on how much an individual movie can achieve in developing a complex narrative just as it is limited in how deeply it can explore character.  The reason is obvious:  a lack of time.  Delving deeply into the lives of a group of characters is a luxury movies simply can't afford.  The clock is ticking.

MAD MEN will, when it is finished, be a narrative of the sixties.  Season One begins in 1960k, shortly before the Kennedy-Nixon election.  Season Two moves almost two years ahead of that.  Subsequent seasons will move the story ahead by a couple of years each time, before coming to an end at the end of the decade.  The sixties was clearly the most remarkable decade of the twentieth century.  The world of 1970 has more in common with today in many ways than it did to 1960.  The changes in our attitudes can scarcely be assessed.  At the beginning of the series women all have their place in the office as servants to the men, accept passively their roles as eye candy and objects of sexual innuendo, and aspire to no more than moving up the secretarial rank.  A gay man in the office is so completely in the office that he seems oblivious to his homosexuality.  But by the end of decade would come the Stonewall riots and the Second Wave of the women's movement would be in full bloom.

One of the dominant themes of the show is the contrast between the world of today and the world of ""then.""  One of the most striking moments in Season One comes when Betty Draper's daughter runs into the living room wearing a body length plastic launderer's bag.  Betty sharply upbraids her, hoping that this doesn't mean that her laundry is laying on the floor.  To modern sensibility a child wearly a deadly plastic bad is shocking.  Or in a late season episode Don Draper allows his completely drunk boss to leave his house with a drink ""for the road.""  He merely smiles when he shouts, ""That's my car!"" as Roger drunkenly tries to find his own.  A pregnant woman at a party can be seen smoking while holding a martini glass.  One of my favorite MAD MEN scenes comes in Season Two, when after a picnic with his wife and kids, Don shakes the blanket they have all been sitting on, leaving the paper and trash on the ground.  It all highlights some of the progress we have made in discipling some of our more indefensible behavior.

As others have noted, the show centers on several ad executives at the Sterling-Cooper advertising firm.  In particular, the film focuses on Don Draper, a brilliantly creative ad exec who has been just as inventive in recreating himself as he has been in promoting the products of the firm's clients.  A serial adulterer, the child of a prostitute who died giving birth to him, and the son of an abusive father, he has had to pull himself from his humble origins to the top of his profession.  All this while protecting his own dark secrets.  Don Draper is a great character, perhaps the most archetypal character to have arisen since Tony Soprano.  And it provided the opportunity for overnight stardom for Jon Hamm, a previously only marginally successful actor who had mainly been distinguished by a string of very small parts on various TV series and small budget movies.  But it is impossible to imagine anyone more perfect for this role than Hamm and series creator Matthew Weiner agreed after seeing his audition tapes.  When the network insisted that Hamm be passed over for a more established actor, Weiner declared that without Hamm he was not willing to move forward with the series.  Weiner won and Hamm went on to win a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.  Draper is a world of contraditions.  At times unscrupulous, he is also capable of great magnanimity and moral rectitude.  A womanizer, he yearns for the ideal home.

The cast is stuffed with great characters and wonderful performances.  I absolutely detested Vincent Kartheiser as Connor on the series ANGEL, though even then I suspected it was more the way he was written than his performance.  Though he isn't asked to perform acts of daring do on MAD MEN, he is exceptional as Peter Campbell.  Like Don Draper he alternates from petty, self-serving moments to acts of kindness and loyalty.  He is capable of being wonderfully protective of Peggy Olson, a woman with whom he has had a couple of moments of physical intimacy, though he can also behave viciously towards her.  John Slattery is outstanding as Roger Sterling, the number two man in the firm and the son of the Sterling-Cooper cofounder.  Robert Morse, the great Broadway musical star of the sixties (including HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING), plays Betram Cooper, the head of the firm.  The almost unbearably beautiful January Jones (at one point in the season much is made of her resemblence to Grace Kelly, and she is gorgeous enough to make it not a silly compliment).  Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.  She also provides many of Season One's great moments, none better than when she starts killing the carrier pigeons of her next door neighbor with an air rifle (with cigarette dangling from her mouth) after he tells her children that he will kill their dog if they don't keep him out of his yard.  The gorgeous Christina Hendricks (who wears some padding to make her figure more Rubenesque and who was wonderful in the recurring role of Saffron on the Sci-fi series FIREFLY) plays Joan Holloway, the office manager.

After Don Draper, however, my favorite character on the show is Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss).  The series actually begins with Peggy's first day as a Sterling-Cooper employee.  Starting off as Don Draper's secretary, she soon shows that she has skills as a writer, and soon becomes valued as a copy writer with a sensitivity for products that appeal to women.  I've told friends that I believe that by the end of the series Peggy will actually be the head of Sterling-Cooper.  I think the centrality of Peggy to the show was shown partly by the show commencing with her first day there and with her unprecedented penetration of the all male hierarchy of the corporation.  Viewers may notice that she gains weight over the course of the year, especially during the last half.  In fact Elizabeth Moss gained no weight.  All changes were the result of very sophisticated make up art and padded clothing.

MAD MEN is one of the most beautifully designed shows you'll ever hope to see.  It may be surpassed by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and PUSHING DAISIES in art design, but no show on television rivals it in clothing.  The look of the show is impeccable.  If you don't remember the sixties, you can relive them by watching this show.

This is a show that anyone serious about quality TV has to know well.  I've watched Season One twice and plan on rewatching Season One and Two as soon as the latter has finished.  MAD MEN is also an example of a new trend in television, a series that tells more or less a unified story over the course of its life.  LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA both are doing this as well.  All are must-see shows.",1222905600,42,7849,4.659636363636364

3256087,5,B000YABIQ6,"I am so intrigued with this year's Mad Men series that I had to see last year's as well. The series is totally intriguing and ingenious; it's tip top.

Back in the 1960s, I was in my 20s and also in the workforce. My experience was very different from the secretaries on the show, as I started out as a young college professor and was always treated with lots of respect by male colleagues. However, a dear friend from that era and I have discussed the series together. She was in the secretarial field, part of the office staff, and experienced all the indignities suffered by the women on the show. The recounting of her experiences allowed me to understand what those women who show up crying in the ladies room are crying about - sexual advances from some male colleague.

The lives of the housewives depicted in the series are fascinating also. They lead me to vividly recall my own mother's life. And, of course, we all smoked! John Hamm's character, Don, is wonderfully mysterious.

I truly cannot recommend this series more. It is one of the absolutely best that I have ever seen. Enjoy!!

And ladies, we have indeed come a long way! I hope young women watch the show and gain a VIVID, TRUE UNDERSTANDING of how things were not long ago at all. This is truly the way it was.

The series focuses on the mysterious life of Don Draper, the head of creative for the fictional Stirling-Cooper ad agency.  Don's secrets unfold as this first season goes on, surprising the viewer with each new bit of information.

3256095,5,B000YABIQ6,"""Advertising is about...happiness."" So declares Don Draper (Jon Hamm) to a client in one early scene of Mad Men, the richest and most complex program on television right now, at least in terms of its portrait of a specific period in American history.

Since so many of the great reviews here provide detail about the setting and basic premise of Mad Men, I won't repeat. I will simply say that no current TV show deals either directly or obliquely with so many interesting ideas and concepts as does Mad Men. Ostensibly about the New York-based ad industry in its early go-go days near the dawn of the TV age, Mad Men is really about a host of things, including:

The male-female dynamic in the pre-women's movement workplace, and its debilitating effects on women.

The rampant and causal repression of blacks, gays and women and the sense of entitlement among professional white males of the era that the world was their oyster.

The growth of a post-war generation of newly affluent Americans and how the ad industry played on their wants and desires to create artifical demand for unnecessary products, and in the process helped create a culture of consumerism, materialism and envy that is having ramifications even today (witness the mortgage crisis).

The early warning signs of the coming fractures in society that would explode only a few years down the road in the late 1960s.

Bottom line, Mad Men beautifully illustrates the irony of Draper's comment. Advertising, it argues, creates unhappiness - by convincing us that we always need to smell better, look better, and own better things, that nothing we currently have is as good as what we could have, whether that means our refrigerator, our car or our spouse.

But I hope I haven't given the impression that the show is a downer. Far from it. Mad Men is also a treat for the eyes in terms of how it captures the styles and artifacts of 1960 America - from the burled wood and frosted glass of the ad agency offices to the omnipresent ashtrays to the sleek Hart, Schaffner & Marx suits. The dialogue is sharp, the performances terrific (especially Elizabeth Moss as naive and ambitious Peggy Olson, Christina Hendricks as the secretary of every man's dreams, and John Slattery as roguish Sterling-Cooper partner Roger Sterling) and the production design impeccable.

I rechecked an earlier episode and also looked at episode 8 and they were both okay, so, so far it's only episode 7.",1221350400,3,336,4.583333333333333
3256143,5,B000YABIQ6,"Wow, this series just took my breath away. It is a deeply thoughtful re-creation of America in 1960, as seen through the lives of the people at a fictional ad agency in New York City. This is a period of time that has rarely been explored in modern cinema.

I was a small child in the 1960s, but I still have vivid memories of that time.  America in 1960 was right at the cusp of sweeping social change. In 1964, LBJ passed the landmark Civil Rights Act; in 1965 he escalated the war in Vietnam.  In 1968, assassinations, riots, the Tet offensive, the sexual revolution, the rise of youth power (from what later became known as the baby boomers), and the election of Richard Nixon as President would start a long period that would  completely re-make American society.

We are indeed a much different society today than in 1960, but the true genius of ""Mad Men"" is that there is a much deeper layer to the way the series underscores the differences between then and now.

I remember the sharply defined gender roles, the men going to work wearing formal suits and ties, the women and their pointy bras, the incessant cigarette smoking (I hated cigarette smoke then and still do), the frequent presence of hard liquor (the style of new American houses of that era included built-in mini-bars for hard liquor and mixed drinks), and the casual racism (I remember seeing a ""whites only"" public drinking fountain for the first time as a child, and asking my mother what that was all about). Homosexuality was something almost unheard of, and definitely not discussed in polite company. Government sponsored warnings were about marijuana and unbecoming dating habits, not about cigarettes, alcohol, or the dangers of large plastic bags.

All of these aspects of 1960s culture are strikingly featured in ""Mad Men"".

The characters in ""Mad Men"" move about in realistic 1960s fashion - all men smoked back then, because they picked up the habit while in the armed forces, which gave out cigarettes in the ration packs. Married men screwed around regularly in secret, illegitimate children were conveniently packed off for adoption (as a child, in school, it was common to find schoolmates who were adopted), and the wives kept silent and divorces were far fewer than they are now. A gay character in the series has an encounter but has to closet his feelings.

We think we are so much smarter and better now than we were in 1960. In this time of Barack Obama, we are talking about a post-racist American society. We have sex education, we have birth control, we have legalized abortion, we have Mothers Against Drunk Driving and police sobriety checkpoints (Roger Sterling would surely have lost his driver's license in today's world), and in case that fails, we have air bags inside the cars. We have smoke-free airplanes, homes, restaurants, hospitals, etc. Smokers are treated like lepers (yea!). Women are empowered, we have Title IX, we have mandatory sexual harassment training in the corporate workplace, we have community property for marriages.

But are we really so much better off today than we were in 1960? By some health standards we are. Average life spans have increased. Traffic fatalities per mile driven were far, far higher back then than they are now. Men used to just keel over and die from a ""coronary"" when only in their 50's and 60's. That rarely happens anymore.

Racism has in fact not gone away, only changed in the details. Poor African-Americans in the cities have gone from being openly repressed to being incarcerated. And even though Hollywood now has black actors in every single movie or TV show (one suspects a quota system), many other minorities are still underrepresented. Muslims and Arabs are now the Negroes of the entertainment industry, portrayed only in stereotypical blackface.

And as unrealistic as the ideal nuclear family in 1960 may seem to us now, it was very real for the children of that time. I do remember that children were much better off then. We children played freely in the streets and backyards without parental supervision. Children usually had two parents, not one. Most children had stay-at-home moms. Parents had definite roles, parents were around, parents did not just break up and disappear as they do so often now.

Today, divorces have skyrocketed, we have children completely unmonitored by either parent because both are working or absent, and the large numbers of children born out of wedlock are no longer given up for adoption to families able to take care of them. Instead it has become the norm for single mothers to try to raise children themselves, often with terrible results for both mother and child. The numbers are huge. One out of three children are now born out of wedlock, two out of three in the African-American community. Women, having become empowered in the workplace, did not at the same time also gain the super powers needed to raise children alone; many men certainly saw this empowerment thing as an opportunity to skip out on their responsibilities as fathers.

Even cigarette and alcohol abuse have not been tamed so much as replaced by the worse problems of marijuana and cocaine.

The year 1960 was a special and yet transient moment in time for American society, the last moments of a pre-pubescent America, still the nave superpower of the post-WWII era, before it began the long, agonizing transformation into the confused, liberated, legalistic, and moralistic America of today.  This was a young, earnest, idealistic America that was on top of the world, one that thought it could do no wrong, thought it had the answers for everything.

And so finally, at the end of this brilliant first season DVD of ""Mad Men"", when we look deeper into what it really tells us, we see that what it says is, my goodness, how we have changed!  But have we changed all that much for the better?",1221350400,11,5876,4.841475573280159
3256144,3,B000YABIQ6,"In some of the Hype for this show the Sopranos is mentioned, do not rate this show as anything like or as good as Sopranos, it is OK, watchable, and how it won so many awards I am not sure about.

Anyway; The opening title sequence features credits superimposed over a graphic animation of a business man falling from a height, surrounded by skyscrapers with reflections of period advertising posters and billboards, accompanied by a short edit of the instrumental ""A Beautiful Mine"" by Aceyalone and RJD2. The titles pay homage to graphic designer Saul Bass's skyscraper filled opening titles for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and falling man movie poster for Vertigo (1958) - Weiner has listed Hitchcock as a major influence on the visual style of the series.

I was not impressed with the openining titles even knowing the above, it just for me did not fit in with era, and watching the 1st 2 episodes does not compliment it in anyway, it looks cheap.

Don Draper(Jon Hamm) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss aka Zoey Bartlet The West Wing) carry the first 2 episodes.  Elisabeth you were so good and sexy in The West Wing, were you hard up to be in this.

3256208,3,B000YABIQ6,"Mad men is almost great, but falls short. The acting is excellent. The capture of many period details is dead-on and many aspects of the story are compelling. But in the end, what kills so much good material is an overly melodramatic story and heavy-handed political writing more concerned with looking back than looking at the era. There is just way too much overly cute foreshadowing in a junkyard of 1950s cliches and stereotypes.

And for everything they got right in terms of the city and business, they got something wrong about life in the suburbs. What was missing was the ambitious cuthroat wives of the suburbs and the wives who didn't care what went on in the city as far as affairs as long as the goodies came in. They are too tied up in a one-dimensional world of ""wife-as-victim"". That was part of the era, but not the whole thing.

The final episode really killed things. The entire season told a very good and compelling story which turned into a melodramatic soap opera series of ""shock revelations"" which undercut everything built to over twelve episodes.

Everyone involved deserves tremendous praise for having so unexpectedly put together something like this. They came closer to capturing the atmosphere of business and being in manhattan than anything I remember ever seeing.

3256211,5,B000YABIQ6,I was just dumbfounded by the cultural references so obvious in this series especially how the writers must have used these books to develop the characters. How the women were pressured to marry 'right' whether out of a seven sisters college or by following the rules of gurley-brown to enjoy work in the pink collar ghetto because its serves a two fold purpose: to get a man and/or keep your mind off of being single. And the men are expected to conform to rigid corporate rules by having the 'right' wife segregated in domesticity but be expected to get the clients/or theirselves laid.,1220745600,,588,4.718446601941747

3256216,5,B000YABIQ6,"Who doesn't love a good period drama?  I'm certainly not such a person, so upon hearing the idea of a cable series set on the Madison Avenue advertising scene as the nation stood on the cusp of the 1960s had enormous appeal.  Especially interesting is the HBO-style (indeed, this was originally pitched as an HBO series, and shot down; I'm grateful, if only because the DVD prices would be that much more severe) unvarnished presentation of the era.  Moralists who romanticize this period as a haven of old-fashioned morality will be disappointed when confronted by the truth (or something like it) about contemporary attitudes.

Our main character is Don Draper (Jon Hamm, in a marvelous performance; it is surprising that he doesn't do more period work, because he's absolutely perfect for the look of the 1950s), the creative director at Sterling Cooper, a moderate-sized ad agency run by Roger Sterling (John Slattery, best known to me from ""Jack & Bobby"") and Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse).  He and his team, most notably newcoming Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, Angel's son Connor on ""Angel""), are charged with marketing such illustrious products as cigarettes (and helping the company duck restrictions imposed by federal health agencies).  Don is something of a mystery both at work and at home, where his wife Betty (January Jones, in a revelatory performance; I'd previously never thought of her as anything other than a pretty face) is living a life of quiet desperation.  Through Don we see the life of a successful male executive; he's got a beautiful wife, more than one mistress on the side (proto-hippy Midge, then department store executive Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the only woman in the show not occupying a menial position, and she owes that to her father), and is friends with his boss Roger.  Below him, Campbell and his cohorts battle for favour and advancement.

Standout performances come from Hamm in the title role, Christina Hendricks as Joan, a secretary well-versed in using her sexuality to get what she wants (she'd be running the place if she lived 40 years later), and Elisabeth Moss as Peggy, a newby secretary with professional ambitions that are well beyond what is expected of women in that era, althoug timid Peggy doesn't seem the type to overtly identify with the feminist movement.

The DVD packaging has been a point of some contention here (see many of the 1-star reviews).  The original lighter-shaped box is a nifty design, though you do indeed have to watch while you close it (although the explanatory booklet in the back seems an effective shield on my set).",1219708800,,2615,4.988505747126437

Not only is it a top-notch show that makes an elegant crossover between the aggressive storytelling of cable and the low-key charm of network shows, but the attention to detail is worthy of any big-budget period film. Absorbing those details rendered in the Blu-Ray definition was like scarfing down a big bag of candy and magically not getting sick from it.

3256270,5,B000YABIQ6,"I was fortunate enought to catch the first airing of this series last year and was immediately impressed by the historical accuracy and attention to detail.  This is not to say that the story lines and acting aren't brilliant, because they are (which would account for all of the award nominations).  Set in 1960's Manhattan at a fictitious Madison Avenue advertsising agency, the stories follow two parallel paths:  the evolution of modern styles of advertising as a key function in Corporate America, and the personal lives of the people responsible for the incredibly creative ad concepts of the time.  The dialogue is often politically incorrect and its portrayal of women may make some viewers cringe, but having lived through the 60's I can say that it is a very accurate time capsule of the standards of the period.  Overall, it is a well written, very engaging and slightly nostalgic look back at a time when the ""medium was the message"".",1219276800,4,946,4.8875
3256271,3,B000YABIQ6,"I had very high hopes for Mad Men given the wildly positive reviews given in the press. I'm in advertising so the subject matter is interesting to me -- but this series is a tough sell.

I was bored beyond belief for the first two episodes, and had to force my way through the first disc. It was dull, plodding, and dreary. The show goes out of its way to show a 'slice of life' from roughly 1960, and sometimes in doing that they lose the momentum of the show.

It's difficult to like any of the characters so there isn't a lot of emotion to the story. The series doesn't really pick up until late in disc 2 when you see all the subplots start to intertwine. By the end of disc four you're interested in what happens, but frankly I wouldn't be disappointed if I never saw another episode.

The acting, set and costume design are all well done -- it just doesn't move fast enough.

There have been some complaints about the case but I have no problem with it. Closing it can be a little annoying when the discs don't line up with the slots correctly, but it's fine.

I like the Play All menu selection so you can watch all the episodes on a disc back-to-back. I'm glad to see they include that when so many other sets do not.

I really wanted to like this series more than I do. But I'm left with an ""eh, I can take it or leave it"" attitude.",1219190400,3,1341,4.138461538461539

It takes place in the 60's and the time period is as much a character of the show as the people are.  It is 100% accurate - the furnishings, clothes and THE SMOKING !!  It is hilarious but oh so true of the period.  Everyone smoked.

When you watch this show you are enthralled for it is one of those rare experiences today.  it is not gratuitous television.  It is a superbly crafted piece of art.  It is glorious how each character slowly develops over the season and we learn more about them slowly as you would a person in real life.  These characters become so addictive.  The ensemble cast is so amazing it is difficult to pick anyone out but Jon Hamm does certainly rule the roost with his presence.  But I am also sure Peter and Peggy will linger in your thoughts.

This is such intelligent television.  It is of the caliber you would expect from HBO or Showtime.  The historical facts are very interesting to me.  They show the whole campaign and election between Kennedy and Nixon.  I am 47 now so was not around for that.  It is so interesting to see that Kennedy was not so overly popular when running and it shocked many when he won.  The first Catholic president.  My, my.  I find that very timely with the election we are facing.

Nothing was spared to make this show the highest quality and the most accurate.  Anyone associated with it should hold their head high and it certainly deserves all the accolades it has received.

3256274,5,B000YABIQ6,"With the possible exception of Deadwood - HBO's magnificent Shakespearean noir-western - Mad Men defies easy comparison with virtually any television drama ever made. While much has already been written on the program's stunning recreation of mid-century cultural/corporate atmospherics and the big swinging casualness of its fidelity is optional lifestyle, the real focus for me is Sterling Cooper's creative chieftain, Don Draper.

He is a man of compromised emotion and is quite literally as ephemeral as the Brands he champions.

Draper's life is a canard, based entirely on an identity stolen from one of his dead Korean War comrades - with his lineage, education, breeding and comportment all fabrications in the service of his assumed identity. His wife is a prop to whom he owes no allegiance - his co-workers ""necessaries"" in the propagation of his fraud.

His is the ultimate fantasy played out within an industry that chews it like Pez. Draper's essence is one of physical inflection married to the danger of living in one's own head - where dialogue becomes superfluous, dangerous and far too revealing. It is the program's singular pleasure to watch Jon Hamm inhabit the role with such detached earnestness as if living on the brink of detection with every breath. His is a morality play of which Deadwood's Al Swearangen could be proud - and slightly envious.

Draper is far from the only thing in Mad Men worth watching. The entire supporting cast is outstanding led by Draper's wife Betty, played by January Jones. For me however, Hamm remains the nucleus of the program and is a tour de force.

3256324,5,B000YABIQ6,"I have been teaching advertising and design for over 31 years. I was just getting out of high school and attending a state university, ending up being an advertising design major when all of this stuff was going on in the ad world. So, my rememberence of the time was very vivid and remember the clash of the old and new ad styles at the time and faintly remembering hearing about the book ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"", but not reading it. I did take a couple of trips to New York at that time to do some work for the company that I was employed, and just going to New York to try and get a job in an agency. ""If you make it here, you can make it anywhere"" was the theme at the time, so everyone wanted to go to New York to get a job, primarily for the experience and the couple of lines on your resume that said so. This, finally, leads up to my review of ""Mad Men"", which I feel comes extremely close to accurately portraying what went on at that time. Visually, it is dead-on as far as details are concerned. I remember that time period looking just like that and feeling like that. I feel that as far as portraying advertising at that time and the beginning of the Doyle Dane Bernbach period is tucked in just the right way. My only slight criticism, and this is a bias since I have been part of the industry and teaching how to become part of it, I wish there were more scenes as far as how the agency functioned and maybe a couple more follow-throughs on specific accounts in the agency. But again, that is personal. Also, maybe just a little less ""soap opera"" between the characters, which does add to the change in women's position in the business and the real world. Enter the working woman/mother, etc. I feel that everyone should see this show. I also wish that season two would come out as soon as possible right after it is finished.",1217808000,,1852,4.234463276836158
3256325,5,B000YABIQ6,"In terms of writing (story, dialogue, character development) acting, direction, and the great, smoothly polished look of every frame, this fine show is as good as TV gets.  And it needs to be said that the best of TV in recent years -- Friday Night Lights, Damages, Battlestar Galactica, The Shield, and going back a few seasons, Everwood, Veronica Mars, Jack & Bobby -- outshines all but the absolute cream of movies.

Alas, the great bulk of television programming is still the ""wasteland"" it was long ago dubbed, but back in the 60s, 70s and 80s when there was almost nothing worth watching on the tube, I can recall that it was every TV actor's aspiration to graduate to ""features"" where the best work was being done (and where the big salaries were).

Today, however, for those actors fortunate enough to be working on shows like MadMen, or others of that caliber, they are already working at the pinnacle of their craft.  They are collaborating daily with the most talented people in their industry -- writers, directors, producers, set designers and fellow actors -- all of whom share an artistic commitment to do great work.  And it shows . . . in every aspect of every episode.

Viewed from the perspective of that kind of fulfilling work experience, the only remaining lure of most movies roles could only be the money.

3256326,4,B000YABIQ6,"The oddest television series of the last decade is actually better on DVD because you can take your time, pause and replay, enjoy the ambience and 60's cachet. A series that is written, acted and dressed in 1960 may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you let yourself be transported back to that time, you'll enjoy this show tremendously. The characters are written with enough complexity to keep you interested, especially key mad man Don Draper, played with disturbing confidence by Jon Hamm. His enigmatic character touches the dark side in all of us, that little corner where secrets are kept and new realities are woven to accomodate them. Toss in institutionalized sexism, the relentless smoking of cigarettes and a sense of entitlement nurtured by television and you've got an edgy, completely original series that's deliciously dark and dangerous. Video quality is crackling clean. The 5.1 audio is subtle and there when you want it.",1217721600,9,943,5.012738853503185
3256357,5,B000YABIQ6,"Few if any shows have combined style and substance as successfully as Mad Men.  This dream of the 1960s is simply beautiful to look at, but more importantly the world evoked is the setting for an exposition of human character and the human condition. The acting is incredible-- Jon Hamm especially. Each episode is a poem and the entire series is like a great mid-century novel. Thank you Matthew Weiner for this gem.",1217635200,2,417,4.712328767123288
3256358,5,B000YABIQ6,"It's no wonder this show is getting so much attention; there's nothing else like it on TV, nor has there been in quite some time.  Somebody is doing a fantastic job of art direction, re-creating 1960 right down to the last detail--and let's not forget all those drinks and cigarettes!
  They are also right on the money with the frustrated housewives and their unfaithful, dissatisfied husbands; the alpha male world of advertising executives; the barely contained sexual energy of the women who work as their secretaries.
  Jon Hamm is spot-on as Donald Draper, the creative director with the seemingly perfect life but a questionable past that he wants to leave behind but cannot; Elisabeth Moss is admirable as his secretary, Peggy, who looks like a pig-tailed school girl but has a tough and secretive side that is slowly revealed.
  The actors portraying Betty Draper, Peter Campbell (who knew that a smarmy little buggar could be a cad at the same time?), Roger Sterling, Burt Cooper, and others are an equal match for Hamm and Moss.  All of the work from the cast and crew has paid off in a big and well-deserved way.",1217548800,5,1124,4.787564766839378
3256359,5,B000YABIQ6,"Finally!  Mad Men proves that television doesn't have to be hackneyed storylines and writing.  At first glance, this series serves as an interesting portrayal of a period that is beginning to fade from cultural memory.  However, it will only take an episode or two to begin to appreciate the poignant themes and writing.  Each character is complex - there are parts of each that you love and hate - sometimes at the same time.  It's amusing to see the situations and themes that we hope don't exist today, but many ideas and circumstances that are universal to most people, regardless the time.

It's such a pleasure to finally find a series that justifies taking time out my schedule to sit back and take in.  The acting is top notch and the costuming and sets are superb.  I think a blog I recently read captured it best - ""I spend more time thinking about what I saw, then actual time watching the show.""

Everyone is comparing it to SOPRANOS for the obvious reasons, but to me it is much deeper than that great show.  It is really about what we (America) became after WWII and it explains a lot of who we are now.  Match it up with movies like SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, THE APARTMENT, and QUIZ SHOW and we're starting to detect a pattern here.  A smoky, sexist, lavish, and ultimately, empty one.

3256363,3,B000YABIQ6,"I recently watched all of the first season due to all the Emmy hype that is out. I was very disappointed and a little confused on why this is considered ""great"".  Don't get me wrong, it was interesting enough for me to watch all the episodes and tune in for the very disappointing Season 2 opener, but it was nothing outstanding to me.  I loved some dramas that were out like Dexter, The Tudors, etc. and thought the acting in them were Emmy material, but not Mad Men.  It's boring, slow, dull, but still for some reaons a little intriguing.  I guess what I really don't like is that you really never get to know the personality of certain characters.  Betty, for instance, is prim & proper one moment, and letting strange men in the house the next minute, and then out shooting neighbors pigeons the next.  I think a lot of the hype deals with the fact that it's set in a time period a lot of people (especially white males) would like to go back to.  Personally, it's kind of scary in my opinion.",1217203200,3,998,4.333333333333333
3256364,4,B000YABIQ6,"Normally, I avoid new shows on TV. After all nowadays, you begin to watch a show, really get into it, and in a few weeks it's cancelled because it's not pulling the demographic the network wants. So, I just wait to hear about the buzz surrounding a show before tuning in, usually after the first season has finished and people are still talking about it. Which is exactly how I discovered AMC's intriguing show ""Mad Men"", just releasing the disks and starting season two this past week.

It's very easy to see how this show can be seen with two sets of eyes, and gleam two contrary sets of meanings from Mad Men. The first set of eyes may watch this show and think, ""Oh, if only life was like that again"". They may pine for the ""good ol' days"", where everyone smoked everywhere, women were room decorations for men to ogle, drinking at work was the norm, even if you were driving or having a child, and men ruled the universe. The men worked long hard hours, and having affairs seemed to be the norm. In other words, the good old days.

The second set of eyes watches Mad Men and cannot help be frustrated and angry at the sexist, racist, homophobic society they are watching. Men openly tell sexist jokes that demean the secretaries in the office, and laugh loudly about it. At a party, another account exec chases a secretary, tackles her, and hikes up her skirt to show everyone her underwear. Two African-American people were fired after some money was stolen from a locker, even though one of them wasn't even in the building at the time. These eyes watch these events and think, ""I hope we've come farther than this.""

At first, watching this show, I didn't know what to make of it. Certainly I subscribe to the second pair of eyes, and wondered if this show was going to be constantly degrading populations of people. If so, that isn't entertainment. As the show gradually unfolds, I began to realize that wasn't the direction the show was going in. In fact, I couldn't honestly tell you what direction it was going in.

When spunky and talented new secretary Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) leaves some copy with office nefario and universal jerk Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, where did this talented actor come from?), you'd expect the usual ""He steals the copy as tries to pawn it off as his own"", knowing full well he would do that, and Peggy would be left with no repercussions.  Only creator and writer Matthew Weiner is much too smart for that. Instead, Pete never even gives the copy any attention at all, which is more revealing of his character and the times. Score one for Weiner.

So the first season zigs and zags, and I found myself angered at times, surprised at times, and laughing at times. Jon Hamm plays the main character Donald Draper with such a 50's ruggedness, he could easily be plucked into any 50's film and immediately fill in. Ad whiz kid, Don carries a secret, and it's not his mistress or a Jewish department store manager that hires his firm. The secret to his identity was an interesting story, but one that ultimately wasn't too ""big"" when revealed. His affairs against his Grace Kelly look-a-like wife Betty played by Janaury Jones, are extremely frustrating to me. His virtuous persona jars against his philandering, and that probably makes his character ultimately more interesting. Betty herself has more problems of her own, numb hands, an unethical psychiatrist, and a new divorcee in the 'hood.

For me, the show all comes back to Peggy. I hope beyond hope that Weiner has great plans for Peggy. Taken by itself, the first season of Mad Men could be frustrating, but knowing that women's rights began to emerge in the 60's, I'm hoping among hope that Peggy's journey will represent that eventual change. As Don recognizes her talent, she moves from the secretary pool to junior copy writer. Let's hope that more men at Sterling and Cooper recognize her talent. Both her and Don together make an amazing professional team. I can see her speaking at his retirement dinner in the 1980's, she has founded her own advertising firm and credits her early start to him.

So, I went from some confusion, to anger, to liking the show, to really liking it. Can I say that I love the show? Not yet, thus the four star rating. I'm eagerly going to watch season two. I have to give kudos to AMC for producing this show. It's about time that interesting, provocative television series move from the limited availability that pay-per-view channels provide, into the cable that is available to anyone with a box. Tune in, sit back, and enjoy.",1217203200,3,4569,4.653035935563817
3256365,5,B000YABIQ6,"Truely the best show on TV.  You get to experience a trip back 48 years.

True quality in every detail from office settings, home furnishings, to clothing styles.  You can't be dissapointed with this show! The acting from all the cast is fantastic and I especially enjoy seeing the mighty attractive characters (Betty & Joan)!

The show can transport me back to a time in the country I never experienced but wish I did. It is a true pleasure to watch these characters portray real people from that time period. Those who didn't always take life so serious (some of them anyway), could laugh and not have to worry about offending someone, drink and smoke and no one tried to make them feel like a criminal.

3256397,5,B000YABIQ6,"The extreme accuracy of detail in depicting those years is impressive. Most interesting, however, is about content.  Discussing this Series with my wife, I absentmindedly said, about the character of Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, ""He's a good man.""  She said, ""No he isn't!""  I then realized, and told my wife, ""That's how he gets away with it!""  What does he get away with?  Well, everything.  He is such a good point man for the company the owner/boss does not care when the weasel tells the boss about his identity theft. A side issue there is, of course, the weasel, Pete, who has committed a Federal crime by opening mail that is not his, is so smart he is stupid.  Why? It's the same reason Draper willingly takes him into the boss's office to reveal the ID theft, realizing that Pete is not realizing that the real big killer info is that Draper is a Jew. Don might as well quickly take Pete up on his threat to go to the boss, rather than submit to blackmail, as soon as possible before Pete gets around to thinking about the real career killer, right? That is not in the show yet, but I bet it will be, eventually. (Wonder why Don got along so well with Rachel?) If Pete had deduced that, then Draper would never take him to the boss.  Telling the boss about an upsetting issue the boss would not care about is a whole lot different than the worst thing anyone, anywhere, even his wife could find out. Notice how Don did not hesitate taking Pete to the boss?  You wait.  At least that is what I would be writing into the scripts. With the archaic attitudes of that company's brass, about Jews, that info would have gotten Draper fired and blacklisted, which, of course, from our point of view now days is about as stupid as smoking all the time.  Thank heavens things have evolved!
Don's wife is played so well.  Don is so good at everything she is happy to be the zero she is. Constantly made aware of how lucky she is, she sits in agonizing unhappiness, the reason for which she cannot explain nor express even to herself. She is so unhappy.  They all are.  This show is so well done that it ranks right up there with the best of Shakespearian Tragedies. At every turn we are shown their pathetic, truly unhappy existence, all of them, all the time, no matter what any of them are endeavoring to accomplish, no matter what roles they play. It's genius!  It's one of the saddest stories ever produced in the entertainment world.",1216944000,5,2440,4.427293064876958
3256398,5,B000YABIQ6,"I actually hadn't heard of this show until I was looking at The Wire here on Amazon. Mad Men was linked from one of the pages so I read through the reviews. With so many positive, I decided to take a shot.

I was hooked after two episodes and watched the entire first season in about 10 days. The show revolves around advertising executives on Madison avenue in the 1960's. The characters are believable and well developed. The dialog is terrific. It is also interesting to see what things were like in the 1960's. For example, the execs all sexually harass their secretaries on a regular basis and it seems to be almost expected.

Watching this series I have found myself empathizing with many of the characters, which isn't a flattering statement.

I am very pleased that HBO are the not the only ones pulling their weight by coming out with good quality film on television ... down with network sitcoms!!!!",1216944000,,909,4.633540372670807
3256399,5,B000YABIQ6,"A secretary's allusion to McLuhan four years before the publication of UNDERSTANDING MEDIA has been cited as a rare anachronism in this meticulous reproduction of 1960.  Aside from one editing glitch (involving a woman's cigarette that is held upward then lapward then upward a number of times), my main ""glitch watch"" observation surrounds a home-movie camera that is treated like a videocamera:  lacking intense lights clamped to chairs for indoor shooting, lacking the need to hand-wind the film every few feet, or lacking the whir of a motor.

(It's also a kick to see Angel's karate-wheeling son emerge here as a lesser corporate demon.  Perhaps Season 3 can link up his character with his own long-lost brother, played by Wil Wheaton.)

This series's main competition for Emmy awards is the excellent DAMAGES.  But depraved nastiness is an easy staple for cable shows, while the intricacy of MAD MEN (without excessive, facile cussing and with a minimum of wish-fulfillment fantasy sequences) sets it apart from the conventions of even the best of television dramas.

The series is just about as fantastic as it lauds itself for being, on the commentaries.  Its creator ""loves"" everything, and other commentary participants slobber big wet kisses on each other--as has become a tradition in disk packages of this kind.  Clearly deserved for costuming and set design, also appropriate for writing and performances, yes; but pointing out parallel themes (a la THE WIRE) is a frequent achievement of greater value.

Some of the technical commentaries (notably on costuming, producing, editing, directing) are as good as any ""field trip"" classes I took in grad school, with production personnel at various Manhattan television stations.  Film teachers would do well to assign these commentaries at any level of ""film production"" instruction.

This, however, is countered by the endless redundancy of Elizabeth Moss who, as Peggy Olsen, does a good acting job but, on the commentaries, finds a dozen ways to repeat the same simplistic idea ... over and over and over and over throughout many, many episodes.  It's nice to have so many commentaries on the disks, but this actress's vacuous chatter is too often used as filler.  She is clearly the production's mascot, but her additions to commentaries for Season 2 should be edited judiciously.

Immediately after watching these 13 episodes about the ad industry in 1960, I viewed MADISON AVENUE (1962) with Dana Andrews as a somewhat older, less complicated clone of Dan Draper, a love interest named Peggy, a Joan-like secretary named Miss Olsen, the actor who later played Larry Tate from BEWITCHED here performing the role of a precursor of Tate, and even the line ""You haven't thought this through.""  Hardcore MAD MEN addicts might enjoy this strangely uncynical addition to the PATTERNS, GRAY FLANNEL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, HOW TO SUCCEED, WALL STREET genre.",1216944000,4,2909,5.183760683760684

I desperately wanted to like it, but I found it to be just ok.  The only characters that I was interested in were Peggy (played expertly by Elisabeth Moss) and also Pete (wonderfully played by Vincent Kartheiser).  Most of the other characters were boring to me.  Most of the storylines, although interesting, were far from compelling.  In fact, they became repetitive.

Sure, the show is very well acted.  It is also technically amazing, evoking the early 1960s in every scene.  I just wish the storylines had drawn me in a bit deeper.  I wanted to care, but I didn't.",1216857600,2,834,4.715277777777778
3256402,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is the first original drama series from the cable network AMC and they hit it out of the ballpark.  Set in 1960 and focusing on a fictional advertising agency Sterling Cooper, the show tells the story of ad men in a haze of cigarette smoke and booze.  The first episode foreshadows the change in our culture as the firm struggles to find a new advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes now that the government won't allow them to use testimonials from doctors that cigarettes are safe.  The show is fanatical with its attention to period detail.  Show creator Matthew Weiner has extensively researched the products, clothes and just about everything else from the period and has created a picture perfect time warp. But that is just a shiny veneer for the deep and dark storylines that include a secret past with a changed identity, depression, heart attacks, infidelity and so many others.  The show shoots off in so many directions, yet never loses focus.  The anchor of the show is Jon Hamm who plays the main character Don Draper.  Mr. Hamm is a revelation and his work is the best of any actor on television this year.

Simply put, Mad Men is one of the best shows I have ever watched and without a doubt the best season of television I have seen since the first few seasons of The Sopranos.

The story arc is enthralling, and the talented group of actors do a tremendous job of giving life to every character in the show.  For anyone looking for a show that is at times dramatic, funny, shocking, and endearing, but always excellent, look no further.  I highly recommend not only this show, but this blu-ray version as it is a tremendous deal for 13, 1-hour episodes.

Speaking of blu-ray, the picture quality is fantastic.  Colors bounce off the screen, and those with 1080p sets will be constantly surprised with the level of detail givin to even specs of facial hair, or the weavings of cloth on clothing.

3256404,5,B000YABIQ6,"Mad Men is one of those very rare TV shows that is both superb and popular.  Sometimes there really is a TV god.  Unlike great shows like Friday Night Lights, people are watching and the awards are rolling in - 16 Emmy nominations, more than any other drama this year.

It's 1960 in a Manhattan based advertising agency.  The men have slicked back hair, crisp white shirts and perfect suits.  What comes out of their mouths would get them slapped or sued if it happened today.  Toots, babe, honey.  Women are sex objects and they have less brain power - as one character says, ""It was like watching a dog play the piano"" when a certain female character with professional drive and passion exceeds the lowly expectations of the men.

The women are no better.  The head secretary tells another female that they (the men) designed the technology so simple that even a woman can use it.  A mother smokes and drinks while pregnant and ignores the danger of a nearby child playing make believe with a plastic drying cleaning bag over her head.  Some of the women act childish because that's the role that's been forced upon them.  Others are starting to reject the social strait jacket and are rebelling - it's the beginning of a new era and they are the foremothers of what is about to hit this nation like a baseball bat to the head.

The wall paper in one house is plaid and the cars are big and many have tail fins.  There's a cigarette in almost every scene - people cough and there's no recognition of any connection in their minds.  One major character smokes, drinks and eats with abandon and almost dies of a heart attack with, again, no recognition of cause and effect.

This show, unlike any on air or cable at this time, immerses you in its era.  It's authentic, real and grabs your attention.  Quite simply, if you watch only one current show on TV this year it should be Mad Men.

Several reviewers have commented on the packaging.  While it is a little more delicate than others, it's still cool (it's like a cigarette lighter) and you can handle the DVDs without damaging them.  The DVDs are held in the case with a foam insert that doesn't scratch the surface.  When you take the DVDs out you have to gently push against the top side with your (clean) fingers and gently push upward.  They will come out and you won't smudge or scratch the surface.  If the DVDs are getting damaged it's because people are just grabbing both sides of the disc and pulling it out.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not been impressed with other boxed sets where you end up literally breaking the plastic sprockets that hold the DVDs in place.  If you want really poor packaging just look at the complete West Wing.  In any case, you can handle these DVDs and not damage them.

The extras here are sparse but very good nonetheless.  There's an hour long behind the scenes docu that looks as all aspects of the show from character backgrounds to hair and art design to the actors feelings about their characters.  It's not full of that fluffy hype stuff you find on other DVD sets where they just show you short clips from the show and present it as somehow something new.  You'll actually learn something about the show.  I would love to see full interviews with all the actors to talk about the characters they're playing.  Maybe we'll get that in the season 2 set.  As noted by others, the commentaries are minimal and a bit disappointing.  Doesn't really matter in the end as it's still a superb show you simply shouldn't miss.",1216512000,131,3520,4.515822784810126

3256436,5,B000YABIQ6,"It would be hard to imagine a more absorbingly intelligent American TV series--in terms of writing, acting, and visuals--than MAD MEN. Just before the final season of THE SOPRANOS began in late 2007, AMC presented us in the summer with the thirteen episodes of this marvelously atmospheric series created by one of the main writers of the series, Matt Weiner, that HBO insanely took a pass on. Ostensibly the series is about a group of advertising agency working for Madison Avenue advertising agency, the fictitious Sterling-Cooper, in 1960, during the Nixon-Kennedy presidential contest; yet on a deeper level the show wrestles with much larger questions about the meaning of obsession with having (and marketing) happiness in mid-20th-century America. The series centers primarily around four characters whose lives are inextricably linked with one another: Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a handsome advertising executive at Sterling-Cooper of few words but enormous creative gifts who hides a mysterious past; his beautiful but childlike wife Betty (January Jones), whom he keeps entirely separate in the suburbs from his work life and his mistresses in the city; Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), Don's new secretary, whose naive affect and kind heart belie her tremendous ambition; and Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), the smarmy account executive who trades on his ties to the Old New York ""Knickerbocracy"" to get him ahead. The four central actors are absolutely first-rate, as are several within their near orbits: John Slattery as Roger Sterling, the roguish partner who is both Don's friend and his competitor; the gifted Christina Hendricks, as the firm's femme fatale head secretary; and Robert Morse, as the firm's wily and eccentric senior partner.

Morse's presence ties the series to his famous work in both the Broadway and Hollywood production of HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, and the episodes make intelligent reference also to any number of important American fictional works about the NYC business and suburban domestic worlds of the post-War era, including THE APARTMENT and THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. (Richard Yates's REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and the films of Douglas Sirk are also repeatedly evoked too, if in less direct ways.) One of the pleasures of this fine DVD set are the superb extras which allow us to see the especially thoughtful work done by the series' set designers, hairstylists, and (particularly) its head costume designer. The commentaries are generally excellent, and it will come as no surprise to fans of the series that not only the series creator, Matt Weiner, and its writers are especially eloquent but so too are its actors, especially Hamm and Kartheiser. The eye-catching design of this DVD package (fashioned to look and open, naturally, like a classic American manufacturer's product: a Zippo lighter) has been rightly praised for its innovation but also rightly criticized for its unwieldiness.",1215907200,278,2952,5.334763948497854

Watching it again, I find that I catch little details and snippets of background dialogue that I missed on first viewing. I got it yesterday and have already watched two of the four DVD's. It's even more delicious on second viewing. I will definitely watch this again and again. I can't wait for Season 2.",1215561600,2,554,4.285714285714286
3256441,5,B000YABIQ6,"This is one of the best written shows currently on TV. HBO and Showtime were foolish to pass up this amazing show. Mad Men is also brilliantly acted and the costume/set design is fantastic.  A must buy on Blu Ray due to the amazing encoding, that makes this slick 60's world look its absolute best.  I long for the old days of New York!",1215302400,4,336,4.234375
3256442,4,B000YABIQ6,"AMC once again proves itself a worthy adversary to HBO and Showtime for producing a quality and highly literate television experience. Time spent viewing ""Mad Men"" is not a passive couch potato exercise calculated to generate a momentary knot of personal nostalgia. The experience is much more than that. Like ""The Apartment,"" a major motion picture released in 1960 and mentioned in this series captures the very essence of big city urban 1960 culture and is utterly convincingly in ways both broad and subtle. The look and feel of the time is spot on. Some of what is defined in ""Mad Men"" may shock current PC culture sensibilities as relates to race and gender relations. At its core, ""Mad Men"" provides the viewer with a blistering and not too flattering look at ourselves and our entrenched culture of consumerism as strong today as it was nearly a half century ago. Jon Hamm leads an inspired cast of little known actors portraying reticent and mysterious Donald Draper, a highly sought after ad man and selling genius. Elisabeth Moss gets second billing as Peggy Olsen, Draper's wide-eyed new secretary. Moss's acting resume includes a stint as young Zoey Bartlett, daughter of the President in ""West Wing.""  As for Hamm, he would make a convincing James Bond and depending upon the camera angle, ever present obscuring cigarette smoke and dim lighting proffered in any given scene, his tall, dark and handsome masculinity contains uncanny elements that are at times mildly suggestive of a young Timothy Dalton, Robert Di Niro, even Kevin Kline. Madison Avenue is reknowned for cynically packaging products or political personalities for retail sale but the consumer's ultimate acceptance is an exercise in free will that is heavily influenced by the cunning efforts of men like Draper. Whether Draper is signed on to promote cigarettes, aerosol deodorant, an upscale department store, presidential candidate or even promoting the state of Israel, he brings a cold and calculating hard edged view of the world to the table. It may be true that the incessant cigarette smoking and hard drinking during regular business hours by almost all of the brilliantly defined characters in ""Mad Men"" is no longer de rigueur, the compulsion towards self-destruction has not changed one whit. No one defines that trait better than gifted actor John Slattery who plays Draper's boss, Roger Sterling. As a partner in the adveristing agency, Sterling is at once a likeable fellow and yet morally repugnant. Slattery pulls off the character effortlessly. The secondary male characters in ""Mad Men"" are well acquainted with feelings of ennui. Many in Drapers's staff for the most part married yet openly pursue self-gratifying liaisons with willing female co-workers with feminine agendas of their own. Some things have not changed one whit in all these years, even as the unadjusted price for a gallon of gas was around 30 cents in 1960 and tops $4.00 a gallon today.  The prices for virtually all commodities may have changed over the years but rest assured, people and their inate capacity to be gulled has not. You'd think we'd know better by now. That is the essential genius and overarching message contained within ""Mad Men."" The successful ad man accepts as an article of faith that the pitch and ultimate message should always contain or vaguely suggest a measure of happiness or bliss associated with the product whether that product be packaged in pill form, a breakfast cereal, an enhancement to health or desirabilty, the only goal is to convince the consumer to open up the pocketbook and buy into the come hither promise of ""new and different.""  Simply put, ""Mad Men"" is brilliantly crafted TV that unabashedly drives that message home.",1215216000,6,3740,5.048543689320389
3256443,3,B000YABIQ6,"The show itself is fabulous.  And I'm pretty sure most of the people hitting this page would agree.  Otherwise, why else would you be here?  You've seen the show, you love it, and you just want to know whether or not to buy the DVD.

Yes, you totally should.  Because the show's brilliant, and therefore you should support it.

The packaging is horrendous.  It looks awesome.  Zippo lighter shooting out flames.  The flames are the problem though.  You have to be really careful taking the discs out (set up stadium style) as you're going to get your fingerprints all over them.  And you have to be super careful closing the box, as the way it's set up, you end up scratching the discs.",1215129600,26,686,4.495934959349594
3256444,5,B000YABIQ6,"I had heard a something about this show in some magazine (Wired?), and then I saw it at the store in a cool enlarged Zippo shaped case.  The only reason I purchased it though was because I recognized one of the actresses from Firefly.  Once I started watching I really enjoyed the 60's they created.  Not sterile but controlled, chauvinistic but poking fun... Lots of lovely ladies, drinking, smoking, and some clever writing.  Since it is only the first season, I suppose its only going to get better.  I've not listened to the commentaries or watched the special features yet but it's cool that they are there.  I will most likely purchase the next season.

One note, as an Ad and Lucky Strike junky, I was very irritated from pilot where they tried to introduce the ""It's Toasted"" slogan by Don Draper in the 60's.  It actually came out in 1917, and was more than likely closely linked to the real granddaddy of advertising Edward Bernays.  They might have considered turning his life into a show, but once I started to watch the other episodes the minor deviations from facts for the sake of entertainment didn't seem so frustrating.",1215129600,4,1137,4.673366834170854

The only thing on there of note is the ""making of Mad Men"" - c'mon. I love this show - couldn't you be a bit more creative - maybe interviews with the actors, stock footage of 1960s era original advertising, easter eggs, blooper reel, screen tests - all the other goodies you expect to get in addition to the episodes.
This shouldn't be construed as a knock at the show itself - which is picture perfect - but if you are going to sit on a DVD release for 10 months at least make it worth the wait. I expect more from Season 2 DVD box Lionsgate / Weiner.",1214956800,11,672,4.052631578947368

If you've got the sense of humor to laugh at how reckless we used to be and how safe and sanitized we've become you have to pick this show up.",1214697600,4,597,4.537037037037037
3256480,5,B000YABIQ6,The best show on TV.  Terrific acting.  Top shelf writing.  An original concept delivered with consummate skill.,1214265600,8,112,5.470588235294118
3256481,5,B000YABIQ6,"The summer of 2007 is when Mad Men swept the nation. Why? It is anti-politically correct. It is an intelligent, thinking man's (""persons"" would be too PC for *this* show)) show for adults. Not to mention the fantastic, Rod Serling-esque realism in the quality of its writing, the direction, the scope, and the dazzling work of the previously unknown cast - now all certified household names - stars, if you will (none will ever have to worry about getting future work).  The best part of this casting is that there are no familiar public-entrenched ""personalities"" to disturb the continuity and believability of the proceedings; a ""star"" would have interupted the realism of the story and surroundings. And, in the process, we get to discover a whole new set of actors (their work and camaraderie is gaspingly satisfying, the most sheerly pleasurable in recent memory).

Matthew Weiner, the show's genius creator, has painstakingly ensured that we're really getting a believable early 1960s. There's not an irritatingly currently contemporary viewpoint to be found anywhere. Of course the show is depicted in a hindsight manner; but all of the dialogue, situations and characters are all breathtakingly, reassuringly of a past time. Despite the deceptively, smoothly stylized look via the posh sets and clothes, the atmosphere is constantly invaded by the smog of cigarette smoke; we're not used to seeing such flagrant puffing and inhaling on film. You can almost smell the overfilled ashtrays. No one goes outside to smoke here. This is the Martini and Rossi era, and everyone in corporate America smoked and drank as if it were part of the life and job description. Then, too, you see women used as business, sexual and marital props. They existed to serve their men (and I hope the PC feminists are in a tizzy, because they should be). To provide their dictation, their pleasure, their masculine image, their food, their offspring. Of course, we see in Joan, the foxy, knowing secretary, using the men in return to get what she wants; and we see in Don Draper's wife (brilliantly, tensely enacted by January Jones) an all-pervasive, unnameable malcontentedness. We see the glaring dichotomies of the men, looking Madison Avenue dapper, but behaving and displaying attitudes of overgrown high schoolers. Most of these men, from today's standpoint, are bastards; and no attempt is made to Ralph Nader or Alan Alda-ize them (it would be interesting to have the series run into the late 1960s, when these men are forced to run into the massive social consciousness that emerged in a shockingly short time later).

Most of all though, the tone of the show is presided over by the brilliant Jon Hamm, whose Don Draper is the most multifaceted character on television in ages. Hamm is blessedly allowed several moments in deep repose, and we can see the massively disturbed soul behind the savvily successful executive. And yet the character's troubled mien allows him to understand human nature, therefore key elements in advertising - how to emotionally ensnare the public into believing the merit of a product or slogan. He's also smart enough to see that Peggy (wonderfully played by Elizabeth Moss), the secretary, with her questioning, probing mind, has a depth unavailable to most of the male executives, to provide key insights into how to sell a product. Hamm's Don Draper is already a classic, public-entrenched persona.  It is a stunningly limned portrayal.

The great strength of this show is its quietly commanding, un-TV-like sense of pacing. You wouldn't call this a suspense show, yet the bottled-up, stealthy sense of pacing keeps us in a tantalizingly unnerved state; you always wait for that cork to explode unexpectedly. The brilliance here is that the explosion factor doesn't always come when we expect it; but the build-up leads us to believe it will. Those explosions come when the build-up has not been prepared, and happens in a swift, tightly controlled manner, never spilling over into predictably cheap shock value.
After each show, we smile, having been on the edge of our seats, engrossed, and left deeply satisfied - and impatient for next week. Thursdays at 10:00. Phone turned off, a glass of wine or spirits.

Another great asset to the overall tone is the darkly cynical humor. Never overplayed or explicitly self-conscious, it nevertheless ingeniously, deftly exposes the foibles of human nature. The most overt humor is slyly depicted by Christina Hendricks, whose eye-poppingly Kim Novak-voluptuous, leeringly confident secretary Joan is an absolute delight. Hendricks looks and acts so unerringly real of the time period, it would be a shock to see her as she really is in real life. She and John Slattery, perfectly playing the sloppily amorous boss, create genuine sexual edge in their scenes together.

Vincent Kartheiser, playing Pete Campbell, an insecure, untalented but ruthlessly ambitious business and social climber, is scarily effective; there's an element of genuine danger in this character. Campbell is so aware of his limitations, and you sense he'd stop at nothing to prove himself.

The good-time unreformed Frat-elevated-to-biz-executive contingent, played by Rich Sommer, Aaron Staton, Michael Gladis, and Bryan Batt, strike just the right notes; they're all joyfully oversexed, blithely good-time, but very real, and we get to see inside their characters.

Robert Morse, the only familiar name in this cast, is perfect as the head of Sterling Cooper, a boss who cares not what goes on as long as the money rolls in.

I hope Mad Men will be on for years to come. HBO's loss is AMC's considerable gain - and is the best-written, best acted show of our time. It will be heralded, discussed, and acclaimed for years to come, and be held as the classic show it has already become. I have never enjoyed something so much as this intriguing, wonderfully engrossing drama. Cheers and thanks to all those involved.",1214092800,166,5962,5.099385245901639
3256482,5,B000YABIQ6,"I experienced a visceral reaction to Mad Men unlike any response I've had to a television show for a long time.  The show elicited a feelings of security and insecurity, comfort and discomfort.  The rigid social structure had me reflecting on a time very early in my life but had a continuous effect in shaping the adult I would become.  As a kid in 1960 I was very aware of racial prejudice and remember the subservient roles played by men and women like the ones cleaning the offices and running the elevators or so told to me with anger and disapproval by my parents and other adults.  I remember my mother dressing in the style of Betty Draper and learning lessons on ""proper"" comportment.  I remember how tall (like Dan Draper) my father was and the uneasy but comforting smell from my father's cigarettes. I remember how cute my mother looked in pedal pushers and how we went on family picnics together.  Only as I have grown older can I relate to Don Draper's darkness and the darkness of racial and gender prejudice in American society. Are we so different now?

I agree with other reviewers that a lot of fascinating tension comes from the time period: all the rigid professional classes and gender roles are on the brink of collapse--or are they just about to sneak underground? It all looks so shocking yet so familiar...
