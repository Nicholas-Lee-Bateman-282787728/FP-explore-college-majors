8150738,1,B000JJ4FE4,"In spite of the title, only three of the episodes include both Stan and Ollie.  One is a promotional short for wood products in which a narrator talks while Stan and Ollie mug and react.  It's from relatively late in their career...in original color and kind of cute (although I skipped to the next item about 2/3 of the way through).

The last three are Stan Laurel silent features, parodies of popular movies of the day.  ""Mud and Sand"" has Stan as Rhubarb Vaseline, an ersatz Valentino a la ""Blood and Sand.""  The films are pretty good but no Ollie in spite of the Duo title.

There's a home movie compilation and an all-star short fund raiser for the National Variety Artists tuberculosis sanitarium.  The Little Rascals get as much celluloid as Stan and Ollie in this one.  (It's ""Stolen Jools,"" not ""Stolen Tools"" as the box says.)

So be forewarned and be aware that many of these films can be viewed on YouTube or viewed and downloaded at Archive.org.",1341705600,,959,4.594117647058823
