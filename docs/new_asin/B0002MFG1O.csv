8029402,5,B0002MFG1O,The videos from Liberty Kids are so hard to find but they helped my students to better comprehend curriculum from that era which may have been difficult to understand.  The materials helped my student comprehend the regular lesson fully and my children at home watch these movies over and over again for years.  My 19 year old daughter's 5th grade teacher had her class watch it at home everyday at 4pm and write about what they learned in the movie and built her lesson from that.  I did the same for my students and added comparisons with stories from the text and the aced every test.  HOPE THIS HELPS...,1353110400,,607,4.541284403669724
8029403,4,B0002MFG1O,This series is great. The only real problem I have with it is that it is really hard to find more stuff. I was speaking with the librarian at the school I teach at and we agreed that this would be a great series for schools to have on hand. Unfortunately it is too hard to find.,1125187200,2,278,3.8947368421052633
