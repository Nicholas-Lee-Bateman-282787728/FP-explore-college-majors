8187083,5,B000NJXBUY,"This is a wonderful story of survival about a depression-era boy whose father is a travelling salesman and whose mother contracts TB and must be hospitalized.  The family lives in a hotel, and the boys cannot let anyone know they are living there in the absence of their parents.  It is well-written, well-acted, and not depressing.  It is, in fact. a joy to watch.",1386460800,,365,4.671875
