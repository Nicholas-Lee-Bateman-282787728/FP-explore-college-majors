2457886,3,B000CCZR86,"This is a very professional, nice looking DVD.  The only problem I have is there is too much time spent intereviewing folks along the way.  In fact, I'd guess 75 to 85% of the time, we are seeing old timers talking about the good old days, instead of seeing Route 66, which is why I bought the DVD.",1156896000,16,298,4.120689655172414
2457887,5,B000CCZR86,"Not just a slice of goodness, this DVD collection is the whole pie! Enjoy with the World's Greatest Fried Chicken, a Ted Drewes Custard, blueberry/banana pie and the best scenery Americana can provide. All the Route 66 staples appear in this collection. Nostalgia is alive and well and on Route 66 The Marathon Tour.",1140048000,24,316,4.87037037037037
2457888,5,B000CCZR86,"This series of discs does a great job of actually telling the complete story of Route 66, not just the fluff that other videos show.  The interviews are interesting and if you are planning a trip, this is a must see before you go.

The set also includes bonus items such as a set of post cards and a cool map of the route.  Great for collectors of the ""mother road.""",1139961600,33,366,4.126760563380282

2457900,1,B000CCZR86,Disappointing. We wanted more visuals of the road and less nostalgia from people who have seen it. It was a lot of talking heads and repetitive titles and credits.,1420156800,,163,4.655172413793103

2457920,3,B000CCZR86,"I agree with most of the other reviewers......to much interviewing.  If this was ""Show and Tell"",it would be not enough ""Show"" and way too much ""Tell"".

2457926,5,B000CCZR86,"This seems more appropriate to the pre-teen set (you know: ""come along with us on our magical journey...""). But I think the interviews with the various business owners and other personalities along the road are interesting and kinda fun to watch, although some of them are a bit more like a sales pitch than a true interview. I like how there are enough DVDs to give a wide variety of coverage along the full length of the road. Now that we've seen this, we've traveled to some of the same places and met some of the same people. Having watched them on screen first made it a bit surreal, but ultimately, made for a better experience.",1370304000,,634,4.474137931034483

2457941,5,B000CCZR86,"We are thrilled with our DVD set. Interviews with people along the route, sights and sounds of the Route, has gotten us so excited to start our RV trip this summer, 2013. Half the fun of a trip like this is in the planning and research and this set, along with a set of state maps  and a book (also ordered from Amazon ) enables us to have all the tools we need to plan our trip.",1365638400,,379,3.9220779220779223

2457943,3,B000CCZR86,"- it's not completely what I expected.
- too much talking and too less images of the road

2457945,4,B000CCZR86,Bought this for myself and father-in-law.  We're both nostalgia buffs and found this to be very enjoyable.  Very low price and many hours of enjoyment.,1353283200,,151,5.0
2457946,1,B000CCZR86,"What a disappointment! As another reviewer said so well, this DVD set seems to be only about ""talking head"" interviews that go on and on. You rarely get to see the diners and giant alligators and gift shops that these folks own and run - you get interviews that are endless. Also, as another reviewer mentioned - you rarely see the road itself and traveling in a huge luxury bus is hardly the way to see Rte 66. I stopped watching this set halfway through the second DVD. What a disappointment!!",1351987200,,495,4.450549450549451
2457947,3,B000CCZR86,Too many interviews and not enough scenery ! Would have liked vision from the moving vehicle and lengthy roadside sceens. We have missed out on the trip on this one! Robbo,1350345600,2,171,4.548387096774194

2457959,5,B000CCZR86,"I have been traveling up and down the Route for over 10 years now.  This DVD set has become somewhat of a historic icon.  The packaging is superb.  It's filled with real human interest stories, not just powder puff fluff like most of the shows about the old road.  Yes, it's a bit slower paced, but what else would you expect with 7 hours worth of programming?

Nothing is left out of this series and several of those interviewed and a few of the locations no longer exist.  The more time that passes the more valuable this documentary becomes.  It's the real history of the people who live and survive along with this lost road.  Personally, I think this is a must have for any Route 66 collector or fan.",1343260800,,705,4.369230769230769
2457960,4,B000CCZR86,I've seen most of the parts and it looks like a nice way to understand the Route66 tour. Good explanations and many site reviews showed.,1341014400,,136,4.48
2457961,1,B000CCZR86,"I had read the (mostly positive) reviews for this compilation and purchased this set based on those opinions. After watching the first 30 minutes or so, I found myself falling asleep at my desk. I turned and looked behind me and saw my wife had already fallen asleep on the couch. This from two people who consider ourselves avid Route 66 enthusiasts and who eagerly consume anything ""Mother Road"". In a nutshell, this production is extremely boring.

I own, and have watched every other available Route 66 DVD and must say I was greatly disappointed with this set. The production is completely void of feeling, unlike other compilations. The interviews are much too long and the dialogue quickly loses audience attention. The quality of the audio during interviews is extremely poor in comparison to post-production studio editing. What's worse is, we really didn't find an ""intimate feel"" to this program, unlike all other Route 66 related films.

Running Route 66 in a 45-foot deluxe conversion bus may be great for the production crew, but it greatly loses the true grit and feel for what Route 66 is all about -- the people, places and ""things"" that makes The Mother Road what it is today. And this film greatly lacks, in immense detail, the road itself. One would think a film nearing 6 hours in length on 5 DVD's would depict much of the actual route and road, but it does not, instead, leaping from one area to another sometimes traversing hundreds of miles between ""interviews"". Far too many ""iconic attractions"" and ""route characters"" either chose not to participate in this film, or simply weren't considered! And really, other than Angel and Juan Delgadillo, the interviews were far too lengthy and ran off into personal details unrelated to Route 66 history. Even Michael Wallis, for all his flair and ""66 flamboyancy"" seemed subdued and less-enthusiastic than in other interviews.

Aside from the lengths of the interviews, the lack of route detail and many missed iconic figures, there is hardly an audio score that keeps you ""in the mood"". Oh yes, they have their attention-getting prelude to each section, but that's where it ends. There's no fluid flow to this set. Nothing that keeps your attention and nothing that gives you any feeling you are right there on the road with them. In essence, in my opinion, this is a boring documentary devoid of any feeling that could have fit on a single DVD. And probably should have!!

I implore anyone who has never seen a Route 66 film to avoid this set and instead purchase ANY of the other available Route 66 DVD's. Because if I had purchased this compilation before my first drive across Route 66 in 2007, chances are I would have changed my mind and canceled my trip. Thankfully, this DVD wasn't available when I began planning my route years ago.",1295827200,33,2810,4.811594202898551
2457962,4,B000CCZR86,"all in all it was good, but why they drove a stinkin bus instead of grabbing some friends and drive your old classic, or truck or bike, why they used a stinkin bus, i don't know, takes awy from the movie.",1287014400,,204,4.0

2457965,1,B000CCZR86,"I don't where to start on what is wrong with this.  It is nothing but interviews -- many with a vested interest (restaurants, etc.) in gaining publicity.  There are virtually no landscape shots or anything that tries to convey the excitement of traveling on this historic road.  There is very little historical perspective (no old photos or movie footage incorporated).  The tour itself is in an RV, which is a slap in the face of the history of this road.  Read some of the highly rated books on Route 66 or drive it, but when it comes to this DVD set, take the bypass and avoid it altogether.",1232755200,28,594,4.462962962962963
2457966,5,B000CCZR86,"After reviewing the opinions of those who had this DVD set, I ordered  The Marathon Tour-Route 66 and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is so much history in the interviews with people that are no longer living and those that are. What a treasure to have this DVD set. Granted it's not an entire DVD on driving the Mother Road, but there are many out there that provide that. To show the history of the Mother Road on DVD by those that helped make it the icon that it is, is overwhelming. I found the personal stories intriguing and an insight into how the 8 states that made up the Mother Road came about. I found out things I had not been able to read in books or other DVD's that I have on Route 66. There is enough of the Mother Road shown in this set of 5 DVD's that just whets your appetite to want to see and hear more.  I highly recommend this set of DVD's to all roadies out there....enjoy the ride!",1195689600,19,903,4.154285714285714
2457967,5,B000CCZR86,"We have enjoyed these DVDs so much that we have booked the flights to go and drive some of the old road on our next holiday. They really give an insight into the mythical attraction of Route 66, and the history of the road.
