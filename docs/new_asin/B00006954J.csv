1730799,5,B00006954J,"It's been a year since that horrifying day in NY.  The world has changed since, and I have changed since that day.  But life went on, and I nearly forgot the images that had haunted me for many months.  Then I saw this DVD on a store shelf a few days ago as I was shopping and for strange reason, I grabbed it immediately.  I remember that when I came home, I put the DVD disc in without thinking much about what I was about to see. But as I watching the DVD, I became, once again, at a loss of words.  I felt as if I was living the same day once again.  My stomach was turning, and my heart just ached in pain.  My lips were tightly shut as I listened and watched CNN reporters hustling to get information as the attack unfolded.  The footages were all there.  The thundering sound of the jetliner passing overhead, and the screaming pedestrians are all in this DVD.  The video clips of people just like you and me jumping from the towers are stored forever in this DVD.  I haven't seen other DVDs about 9/11, so I cannot say anything about those DVDs.  But to me, with this DVD, knowing that some of my money spent on this DVD will be going to the victims of this tagedy, is good to know.  I don't know anybody in NY or Washington or in Aghganistan.  But as a human being, I am feeling deep remorse about the fights we are making and the killings we are doing unto ourselves.  Afterall, the world is like a big apartment, and we are only tenants on this planet.  ...Well, those are some thoughts that I dwelled on after watching this DVD.  This DVD not only has the footages of the 9/11, but it also shows the events in the following months after the attack including the anthrax scare and the war in Aghganistan.  The spoken words and recounts are poignant, and the reporters' words are from their deep inside.  I felt as if that event a year ago is happening again at this very moment. I pray to God to help us all...",1031356800,12,1921,4.185286103542234
1730800,5,B00006954J,"September 11, 2001 was no doubt a tragic day for the entire world..CNN has used their experience and knowledge in putting together a wonder documentary of this horrible day..Sure it's not a day we want to think about,but we have to remember now because it is a part of history and CNN has done a great job in pooling their resources for a great documentary..THANKS CNN..",1031356800,2,370,4.621212121212121
1730801,5,B00006954J,"This DVD is a must!  It recounts not only the dreadful events of Sept. 11 via incredible, vivid footage rarely seen before, but also covers the events of the subsequent year and America's response to terrorism.  It includes footage of the President's response to the news on that day as well as his trek across America, the war in Kabul and the search for bin Laden, the anthrax scare, it even has a bonus feature:  The now-famous speech given by President Bush in front of Congress, completely unedited and in incredible video quality.  The footage is unequalled throughout and puts the viewer right in the middle of the action.  Various interviews with key CNN anchors and personnel add a nice touch and presents many of the familiar faces that we see on the news in a very personal and emotional context.  Sadly, people tend to forget what is not continually in front of their eyes. I think every American should purchase videos like these so that we truly may 'NEVER FORGET' what happened on American soil that day. Respectful, tastefully presented, an outstanding presentation.",1030838400,34,1082,4.853260869565218

1730803,5,B00006954J,"I bought this disc after having watched the first part on CNN. Kudos to them for putting together such a respectful account of the horrible day that changed America forever. It brings back all the pain and anguish caused by the events of 9/11...and things you tend to forget. The images of the planes going into the Twin Towers is indelible. But the interviews with relatives and loved ones on the streets of NYC, holding photos of their missing family and friends...are just as powerful. Try not to lose your own composure as you watch a CNN reporter nearly lose it on camera after talking to the son of a window washer who was just doing his job that day. As someone who was born in NYC and spent most of my life there, I watched this with a heavy heart and will treasure it forever.",1030233600,17,785,4.383561643835616

1730805,5,B00006954J,"I saw tonight the first part of the ""CNN Tribute"" I ordered through Amazon a few weeks ago. I rate it 5 stars torned between the quality of the documentary and the horror of this mass murder(but no horror can be rated).
Tonight,I relived this blind attack as if it was yesterday and once again I was overwhelmed by my feelings, weeping silently with sadness and revolt and for the victims...
That day, as I was getting ready to go to work, a friend of mine called me and told me ""America is under attack, it is terrible, turn your TV on,it is war !"" She was crying on the phone.
I seize the opportunity to say how I appreciate everyday the professionalism and competence of CNN journalists.
I will never forget the way ALL OF THEM covered 9/11 despite the tremendous shock of the events. You could feel their emotions but they were there, still there, for hours, round the clock...

I watch every year surrounding the anniversary of 9/11.  This is not a detailed account of all the logistics of the event as some of the negative reviews lament, but it does provide a good overall sense of the emotional experience and uncertainty surrounding the events on and after September 11, 2001, and the brief, but unifying patriotism that took place when for a brief period in time we were all Americans, rather than segregated by race or political party.  On that day, the humanity of helping others became paramount to any other problems because we as a nation experienced such a national tragedy.  As my daughters get older, I hope to share this DVD with them so that they get a sense of the significance of that day.",1281830400,,860,4.564935064935065

This DVD jumps around a lot, which makes it a bit confusing as to the flow of that whole day. A lot of pats on the back for CNN but not at all what I was looking for. It's not a bad account, just seemed to jump around way too much.

I also saw National Geographic's Inside 9/11. A 2 DVD set. One disc about the events leading up to 9/11 (not what I want) and one disc that gives minute by minute coverage of that day.

Terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001. Eight years. It's only been five years since 9/11 ... are we prepared for another attack?

Katrina should be another big lesson-learned that America doesn't have the infrastructure to help everyone in a disaster. Terrorists know this, now.

Although they show 1 to 2 impacts of planes, this stripped down version of the real events hides the truth.

In this dvd no reports of the hundreds of eye witness accounts that reveal many explosions going on at the twin towers before and after the ""planes"" hit.

There is so much left out of the dvd that i decided to compare it to the first dvd.

The differences clearly show that a lot more needed to be edited before the public figures out, what really happened that day.

This dvd is a one sided slap in the face to victims and Americans in general.

1730883,4,B00006954J,"I purchased the 2002 version of this DVD primarily to

verify certain evidence that appeared in the video, ""911

in Plane Site.""  Overall, it's a depressing experience

watching the video.  Too bad the video ""911 in Plane Site""

is not available on Amazon.com.

This video includes the footage of the plane penetrating

the South Tower.  If you step through it frame by frame,

you can see that the underside of the plane appears

warpped and there appears to be a pod of some sort

attached under the right wing where it connects with the

fuselage.

There are exactly three possibilities regarding that pod:

1.  The pod is a digital artifact or an inadvertent fake.

2.  The pod is a hoax -- the video was altered.

3.  The pod is real.

We can rule out possibility 1.  The pod casts a shadow on

the underside of the plane.  Also, when you step through

the video as the plane enters the building, three dots

appear.  Two correspond to the two jet engines.  The third

occurs where the pod is.

Possibility 2 is unlikely on the CNN video.  They probably

got the video very early after the 9/11 attacks, and the

video is unlikely to have been hoaxes.

Possibility 3 is the only remaining possibility.

Something is attached to the bottom of the plane --

something that does not belong on a commercial airliner.

In other words, the plane that hit the building was not a

commercial airliner.",1103328000,5,1398,4.555102040816327

I am not really a big CNN fan, but the fottage and commentary in this dvd did not have the trademark left spin of CNN. The film shows enough to make you remember, but not too much, like they did live. for example the reporters getting emotional during interviews and the people hanging out of the windows above the impact levels. The only reson why 4 insted of 5 was that some of the film music and fottage seems to try too hard to jerk tears.

We lost some of our innocence, realized our vulnerabilities, and came together in our time of greatest need to make a stand.  The tragic loss of life will always be heartbreaking and it will never be forgotten.
Among the several documentaries that I have seen on the events of September 11th, I'd have to say that CNN has produced the most worthwhile program to date.  Both comprehensive and poignant in its content, the timeline of the attack and events of subsequent months are well detailed and accurate.
Beginning with the attack on and the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers, CNN correspondents report right from the streets of New York amidst the chaos of the attack capturing powerful eyewitness accounts and remarkable footage of the heroic acts of many involved.  Moving on from there, the crash occurring at the Pentagon and the downed airliner in Pennsylvania are then analyzed.
In the aftermath of the attacks themselves, CNN examines further events that had pivotal roles resulting from terrorism in America.  Operation Enduring Freedom, formation of the Office of Homeland Security, and the Anthrax attacks being the most noteworthy of all.
In memorializing the worst terrorist attack to ever happen on American soil, CNN has done a very credible and worthwhile job in bringing it to the public.  Quite moving and even inspirational at times, this is a lasting testament that helps signify the strength and resilience of the Unites States in one of its darkest hours.",1062374400,15,1592,5.011363636363637

What's remarkable about this production is how they made the news so personal and touching.  They didn't just take footage from actual broadcasts but managed to choose the most poignant clips then interspersed these clips with personal accounts from the people reporting the news.  What was presented in this DVD was MY experience of September 11th.  It was a day spent in front of the TV feeling shocked, sad and angry as I watched events unfold.  I felt those feelings again and found myself in tears yet again.  While other productions have done a good job of showing us the personal tragedy of September 11th, none can compare to capturing what it was like for most Americans.

The coverage here is balanced and insightful. The individual reporters tell their stories, and then the footage of the day is played. At one point, we see a young newswoman's face screwed up in grief as she interviews the nephew of one of the window washers.
There is no censorship here- the crowds react like typical New Yorkers- and even the usually staid DC population is seen running in horror. The raw immediacy of the unfolding tragedy is very obvious. It is clear that some of the camera crews were themselves in danger of being injured or killed in the process of taping what we saw.

1730902,5,B00006954J,"This was the first DVD I bought, having to do with the horrific attack on our country on Sept. 11,2001. I was very touched by the way CNN reported on the events, as they showed much respect and honor to the victims and their families. One reason I wanted to have this DVD was so that I would have a record of what happened on that tragic day. The other reason was so that I would have something to pass on to my son, so he could show his future children. I highly recommend this DVD. Thank you CNN for a job well done.",1032048000,9,518,3.9903846153846154
1730903,5,B00006954J,"CNN's DVD ""America Remembers"" is without a doubt the best document produced thus far on the events of September 11th, 2001.  There should be copies in every school library across the country to remember the events of this day in the United States.
The story begins, of course, in the CNN newsroom and the first airline crash in the north tower of the World Trade Center.  The rest of the DVD is an incredible and very detailed timeline regarding the other plane crashes (in NYC, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C.), the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, the evacuation of various buildings in D.C., President Bush's story on that day, the days following 9/11 including the president's speeches, the buildup to war in Afghanistan in subsequent months, and even the threat of Anthrax in the United States.
If you must witness this story again, especially on the anniversary of 9/11, it might as well be thorough and accurate.  This is the production to see.",1031961600,86,962,4.853658536585366

Everyone should watch this again, just to remind themselves how lucky we are to be alive and to live in America.",1031443200,2,353,4.014285714285714

CNN put all of the footage here and the disastrous commentary by its anchor who couldn't tell ""by all the smoke in the way"" that the tower had collapsed, when everyone watching could see the obvious for themselves. Horror of horrors for families and friends of victims; a nation watched with disbelief. Not Pearl Harbor. Not again. How could we be so stupid? One only had to look to the White House. Remember Katrina? Remember Iraq - mission accomplished? Remember the weapons of mass destruction and the denial that the collapse of Wall Street was nothing to worry about in 2008. It all came crashing down and started this day, September 11... and it was downhill the rest of the way.",1457568000,2,927,4.5568862275449105
