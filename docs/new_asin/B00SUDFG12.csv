6992872,1,B00SUDFG12,"Usually I do not write reviews even for bad movies.  However, I am making an exception.  This is by far the WORST movie ever.  I rented this because of actor Danny Glover's name.  It is very sad to see Danny Glover in this TERRIBLE movie.  The acting is TERRIBLE.  The action is TERRIBLE.  There is NO sword action fighting like on cover on movie.  Instead, most of movie is about Danny Glover talking into a fuzzy monitor and Rob Baard and his associates in military uniform fighting SLOW action, like those fake kung fu moves, except there is more AR rifle action than actual ninja and martial arts.  Please do not waste your time or money.  You will be sorry like I was.
This is a very MISLEADING title and cover to a terrible movie.",1428624000,6,736,4.385185185185185

6992874,5,B00SUDFG12,"My name is Slade Yuille and I visited the USA in March 2015 and was informed that the DVD movie that I stared in and was Directed by Rob Barrd in Geelong Victoria Australia was now available right here in the great old USA.
The role that I played was an Italian Mobster and Chauffeur Driver for the head of the Italian Mafia played by Morris Senlla.
This is one of the best movies that I have stared in and I am sure that there will be many more that this Director will be on the filming list when I return back to Australia soon.
So come on you guys please support the Aussy Actors and the Directors and Writers in buying Australian Made Movies.",1426464000,3,646,4.176
6992875,3,B00SUDFG12,Interesting concept. Story is well thought out however the acting and directing make this movie seem disjointed at best.  The fight choreographer needs to train his stuntmen and his actors better in selling the punches and perhaps give them some weapons training in pre-production.  The fight scenes were hard to watch because of the slow speed and weak combat performances.  I gave it 3 stars for the concept only this movie needs a new cast of skilled actors and stuntmen and a new fight choreographer.,1480204800,,504,4.905882352941177

6992884,1,B00SUDFG12,"I'll follow suit with the craptastic reviews for this movie.  What a bomb.  And I don't mean that in the vernacular of today's youth meaning to be great.  This was a stinker, plain and simple.

It was hard for me to watch Danny Glover in this movie.  If this would have been the first time for me seeing him work, I would NEVER want to watch another thing by him again.  The acting sucked, the writing sucked, the storyline sucked.  Basically, it sucked.  Never again.",1469059200,,468,4.423529411764706

6992888,1,B00SUDFG12,This movie was aweful. I was shocked that Danny Glover was in this. I was wondering if he even knew he was in this movie. I would like my hour and however many minutes back so I can drag my face through gravel from a moving vehicle instead.,1467158400,,240,4.020833333333333

6992921,1,B00SUDFG12,"The Australian Ninja Strikes Back!
Have we learned nothing from cheesy 80s & 90s action movies? Apparently the filmmakers did not. I enjoy a solid Van Damme movie, it reminds me of my youth. Theres something about listening to Arnold yell ""Get to the chopper"" and ""Stick Around"" that makes you suspend disbelief and overlook catchphrases in a life or death scenario. Bad acting, terrible writing and inexplicable split screen. The only way this movie could top the worst 80s movie cliches is adding new overused and terrible effects like shaky cam and the lens flare from Total Recall. Oh wait...",1439424000,,596,4.910891089108911
6992922,1,B00SUDFG12,"Bad acting and a very poor story line.  All-in-all, steer clear of this one.  Not worth your time. The 1 star is only for the cover art of the movie.",1439164800,,149,3.933333333333333

6992926,2,B00SUDFG12,"The plot was too essoteric; and the storyline was disjointed throufhout.  About 30% inro the movie I lost interest in trying to follow the events.  As well, the cinematography was worse than a liw-budget TV mini-series.",1438214400,,219,5.055555555555555

6992930,2,B00SUDFG12,"Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in years.  What was so interesting is that as I watched it I thought to myself that the lead actor must have been hired because he or someone he knew had invested some money.  When the credits were rolling, I was so surprised to discovered that my thought was on point. Not only is Rob Baard the director, one of the producers, but the lead character.  Rob should stick to producing and leave acting to those who are skilled in the craft.  Felt sorry for Danny Glover. I guess he needed a payday.  Roger Neave was the best actor in the entire movie.  I will acknowledge that there were some very profound philosophical concepts promoted.  However, it was hard to get past the poor to mediocre acting skills, and the fight scenes which looked like practice sessions in preparation for filming.",1436745600,,851,4.559210526315789
6992931,2,B00SUDFG12,Why do I watch movies where someone is being tortured? I was hoping for some good fight scenes but those were few and far between. There are better movies to watch.,1436486400,,164,4.32258064516129

6992937,5,B00SUDFG12,"Though this didn't have the highest in special effects budgets and the ending was a little difficult to follow, the deeper meanings and themes in this film are very much about the deeper spiritual questions we have in life, in spite of having a job to do. The deep philosophy is something I'm really into, so I absolutely loved this film. As a teacher of spiritual philosophy, I can only see giving this the top rating, because it delivers exactly what I hoped it would. And we have to accept that not everyone can put millions into their special effects budgets, especially when the production isn't high budget to start with. But it certainly has a deep message and one that seems to change each time I watch it. I completely love this film.",1430092800,2,743,4.552238805970149

6992941,5,B00SUDFG12,"This movie was a great action film but also a very spiritual film. During the film there were many spiritual lessons. Even though it's not big budget it's worth it if your looking for more then just action. In my opinion this is truest Ninja film there is. Showing the growth of the main character to become the Ninja.

Rob Baard uses authentic Bujinkan Ninjutsu not the stuff you see in other Ninja films.",1429142400,3,406,4.486486486486487
