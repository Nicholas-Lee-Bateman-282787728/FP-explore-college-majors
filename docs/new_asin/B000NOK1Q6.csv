8180347,2,B000NOK1Q6,"This DVD comes from Hong Kong, as the U.S. release is long sold out.  It is region free, and plays fine in my Region 1 player.  The bottom line is: this is a terrible transfer of the movie, for several reasons.  The video quality is no better than an old VHS tape.  I wouldn't be surprised if they simply digitized a VHS copy of this movie in order to make the DVD.  Second, the version of the movie on this DVD is cropped to a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  The original movie was filmed in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, so the right and left sides of the image have been cut off in order to get it to fit a 1.33:1 frame.  Third, there are forced Chinese subtitles that appear inside the image frame that cannot be turned off.  The spoken dialog is in English, so the subtitles are there for the Chinese audience, but there is no way to watch the movie without them, so they obstruct the image throughout the entire film.  If you can find a copy of the U.S. release, you would be better off to pay a little bit more money in order to get a superior product.  This Hong Kong release is plagued by a horrible VHS-quality image that's cropped to fit the old CRT televisions, and there are forced Chinese subtitles that can't be turned off.  Hopefully, they will eventually re-release it in the U.S.",1502496000,2,1280,4.269709543568465
