8289529,4,B001CUB3KI,"One thing is clear, the investigation into the OJ murder trial of his ex-wife by stabbing was bungled by the police. This is the case put forward in this documentary.

Regardless of whether or not one thinks OJ is guilty, the information put forward in this documentary is an interesting examination of the case. The documentary contains statements and information from those involved in the trial who were both for, and against, OJ.

Effectively it became a case, at least in the jury's eyes, of police procedure and process, and not necessarily the evidence for or against OJ.

Although the prosecutor, Marcia Clark, was indeed very competent, the police involved were not. And yet it is up to the police to be competent, in order for prosecutors to be able to do their job effectively. The police essentially let her down.

In one very real sense, one couldn't blame the jury, but they could have perhaps looked more at the actual evidence, rather than almost solely the way the police conducted the investigation.

Some details of the case and some of the evidence shown here, some of which was also not discussed in the trial or considered by the jury, include:

-OJ having a badly cut finger to which OJ did not have a response (which was not discussed by the prosecution).

-having a single glove found at his home which the other matching glove found at the crime scene, with OJs blood on both (which evidence was ignored, by being tainted by the officer involved being caught lying in an unrelated matter)

-blood at the crime scene which matched OJs, as well as on his socks and on his car door (which were ignored due to police officers not following proper procedure during collection and analysis)

-OJ repeatedly changing his story of his whereabouts

-the `suicide note' left by OJ, during a rambling car chase after his initial arrest.

-the repeated history of violence from OJ towards his ex-wife.

By the police not following proper procedure, and being lax in procedure, the police unwittingly put doubt in the minds of the jury, that the government's case against OJ was tainted and flawed.  The jury, essentially, confused the way the police and prosecutors handled the case, with the evidence that was actually available. An important point was made by the defense at the end, ""who will police the police, you do!"" (Talking to the jury). This is the way the jury interpreted the case. Were they right? Yes, and no.

Nobody wants innocent people locked up due to police bungling and cutting corners, but also, nobody wants guilty people to get away with murder due to police bungling and cutting corners.

This case was essentially a proxy for government and police procedure, and the way the government may be perceived to be biased and lax in the way it treats different individuals, not just between black and white, but between the way the judicial and police system can act against any vulnerable individual.

In other words, the jury were adamant, that a person can only be found guilty if the dual process of police procedures and proper legal process are followed, not whether or not the available evidence may or may not be beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence was seen to be in reasonable doubt when police procedure is seen to be compromised.

The case then, is ultimately about whether or not someone should be found guilty if the police don't do their jobs properly. By induction, it is also about whether they can potentially be seen to be acting in the interests of a majority against a minority, in this case, potentially against African Americans. It is not really a case about race, but whether police follow procedures against what are perceived as any less powerful or vulnerable minorities.

It is also perhaps true however, that the jury didn't really understand the subtleties of the case against OJ. Examples include that some evidently did not understand the nature or details of the blood sample matches.

It is likely an example of poorly resourced and out-of-touch government departments, similar to what happened with the SEC during the financial crisis.  It costs money and resources to train police officers to understand and follow procedure. It costs money and resources for sensitive medical forensic procedures to be understood and followed.

When Bernie Madoff was arrested for financial fraud, in the biggest case of financial fraud known to date, he made the comment that low level government officials bumbled various investigations into his fraudulent activities. Better people tend not to work for government departments, partly because they are under-funded. And those that do, are not always well trained. So one could argue, that both the Madoff case and the OJ case revealed weaknesses in the way US government departments are resourced, trained, and funded.

An interesting explanation of the details of the OJ case, regardless of whether one thinks we was guilty or not.",1423526400,3,4940,4.919374247894104
8289530,3,B001CUB3KI,This was a good DVD for understanding basic criminal procedure and legal strategy.  It is a bit dated now but most of it is still relevant.  A bit slow in places now that the immediacy of the Simpson case has long worn off.,1411344000,,223,4.162790697674419
8289531,5,B001CUB3KI,"I used this video in my Civics class during my criminal justice unit, it was really good.  I learned so much, never realized how much evidence the prosecution had against him.  My students were shocked with all the evidence he was found innocent, we had to discussed this was the time period before CSI and forensic science shows they are so familiar with today.
NBC Dateline did a 20 year special in June but I enjoyed this video way more, straight to the point and less dramatic. This video is good for your students or just someone interested in the case and what exactly happened.",1369267200,6,584,4.552380952380952
