2309805,1,B0009PLLN6,"Sure...Colin Farrell is a handsome man.  Perhaps more than that.  And yes, he is a party boy.  And probably a player.  However, in my opinion, he's also a great actor.  And has been in every movie I've seen with him in it, regardless of the movie itself.  ""Alexander"" may not have been a great movie, but it certainly wasn't Colin's fault.  Most movies that don't do well should be blamed on the story.  You've got to have a story, people.

I was looking forward to seeing the ""true"" story of Alexander the Great on screen.  Unfortunately, due to Oliver Stone's surprising need to cater to convention and his reluctance to follow through fully with the homosexual relationship that was a part of Alexander's life, we were left with just bits and pieces.

Therefore, I looked forward to the DVD coming out where I could see and appreciate the true ""Director's Cut.""  Sadly, I didn't realize that ""Director's Cut"" meant that Stone was going to further cut out history and make Alexander heterosexual to ""appeal to a wider audience.""  Because of this...I won't be buying the DVD and can't recommend it to anyone.  Oddly, Stone may be in for a huge surprise when DVD sales flop.  His homosexual audience won't want the DVD because of the changes...and his heterosexual may not be aware of the changes.

I truly hope that Stone will come to his senses one day and release the version of the movie he had originally intended.  At that time, we can view the director and the actor as they were meant to be seen.",1117152000,10,1504,4.593984962406015
2309806,5,B0009PLLN6,"First point - I went well armed. By the time I hit the 3/4ths-empty theatre, I knew that my favorite movie review site, Rotten Tomatoes, was showing an absolutely disaster of critical proportions. Somehow the reviews were so universally hostile that I decided, contrariwise, to wait until I saw the film myself. And I found myself disagreeing, but for an interesting reason. If 'Alexander' fails, it won't be so much for the flaws of the film - and there ARE flaws - as because none of us can make an easy connection with either Alexander, his legend, or his pagan world. It's simply too titanic to involve the average filmgoer, who'd rather be seeing a modern thriller.

I went with a friend who knows nothing of classical history, but is smart and perceptive. She was bored to tears, and said ""there was no one in that movie I could understand or care about, no connection made between the audience and what was going on on-screen."" And I think that will be at the heart of this movie's reception - a 3-hour epic about people dead 2300 years ago, in a world none of us can imagine, a pre-Christian world even those of us who hang about here can only touch in occasional perceptions - is just going to leave the great American mainstream dead cold. If it takes in as little money at the box office as my theatre showed last night, it will be a DISASTER. And my own opinion is - not at all deservingly!

The financial success of Gladiator made movies like Troy and Alexander possible, and ""Alexander"" may well stop that particular niche market dead in its tracks. Gladiator had us all hooting, historically, but it did present a series of plot and character features with which the Average Joe or Jane could identify - poor general, caught in politics, family dies, fighting his way back for Truth, Justice and the Roman Way. He's wearing funny clothes, but he's a recognizeable regular guy. Alexander has a much bigger problem - how to make us connect with the greatest conqueror in the world, a bisexual ancient Greek, whose whole conceptions of honor and glory are, in our diminished age, food for chortles and embarrassment. And, of course, trying to make a major film about a bisexual character is simply going to kill this film if the difficulty in reaching back to the mindset of a Macedonian prince 2300 years ago wasn't tough enough. So what is amazing, IMHO, is not where Alexander fails, but where it succeeds, which makes its probable fate as a film rather sad.

It's over-the-top, crammed with riches cinematographically, full of intrigue, passion, anger, loss, disillusionment, and the simply SCARINESS, to most of us, of the values of a nearly-invisible pre-Christian past. There are so many scenes that just leap out and grab you - Philip of Macedon (oddly played by Val Kilmer, but with a certain brute pathos) taking the young boy Alexander through a cave filled with the blood and tragedy of the old Greek legends like Medea and the disasters of Troy - the battle at Gaugemela where the King of Kings stoically watches his Persian army fall apart - the moment where the boy Alexander rides Bucephalus for the first time - the entry into Babylon (talk about CGI wonders!) and the look on Colin Farrell's face where he has found ""the sweet fruition of an earthly crown"") - then the disintegration of the years-long army traveling ever further west, into more and more alien country (just like Stone tries to take US into alien time and country), the ambitions of the generals, their hostility to granting vanquished Persians rights in what they - but not Alexander - foresee as simply a Macedonian plunder fest, the slow desintegration of Alexander himself . . . the story is waaaaay too big, and way too long, but historically I think it covers every possible aspect of the development and death of this extraordinary man.

At the final battle scene, where in India the foe is using war-elephants - was this the first time anyone from the West had ever been so attacked? - and his troops flee from these monsters, only to have Alexander and Bucephalus, in a kind of horrified courage, charge straight at the beasts with tragic consequences . . . is incredible visual filmmaking at its best. The death of Alexander after a despairing and angry drinking bout had people sniffing in the aisles. It wasn't his death, but his disillusionment - with being a hero? with conquest? with life itself? who knows, but Farrell made it very plain we were watching a tragic hero - that struck me most. The desintegration of his empire was obviously next.

Colin Farrell gives a highly-underrated performance; I thought he was brilliant, and all the reviewers seem to find is to complain about his hair styles. I found the whole scenes flashing foward to an aging Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) mildly clunky, but I do understand how much historical information Stone had to get across. The script is weak and frequently misses that balance between our sensibilities and theirs - ""May Zeus protect us!"" is more likely to elicit embarrassed snickers than thoughtful understanding. But historically, it's a treasure trove of riches, from the historically-accurate ancient clothing and warfare, to over-the-top descriptions of Alexander's mother and her bedrooms full of snakes, extreme, exciting, occasionally tottering into ludicrousness, but (for anyone interested in ancient history) an amazing three-dimensional, flawed, fascinating spectacle. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it - it's passion is so much greater than that of this year's Troy, just as its weaknesses are more evident.

I suspect in the box office, it will fail for the wrong reasons - that it's just easier for millions to look at ancient history as something they can't possibly understand - and don't WANT to understand - than to try to follow the lead Stone wants so much to give us, the past as prologue. You might say we few, here, who care about understanding the past, can judge it far more fairly.

The bottom line, for me, is whether popular entertainment is good enough to make us want to learn the true history behind the story. I've never been able to see Alexander the Great as more than an icon, a white statue of a head of someone I couldn't grasp. After Alexander, I want to learn everything I can, because now, for me, he's become real. My highest compliment ;)",1116979200,16,6355,4.7718181818181815
2309807,1,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone has made a career out of beserching honorable people he does not agree with and inventing drama where none exists. In the case of Alexander, there is a wealth of potential for a wonderful epic. However, Stone, ever the Hollywood liberal, turns it into an expose on the gay lifestyle. Who cares if Alexander was gay, or if he had a complicated relationship with his mother. The fact is, he was one of the greatest warriors and military strategists of all time. However, in this version, all that is incidental to his relationship with his boyfriend. If David Lean were alive, THEN, we would have seen an epic of epic proportions. His portrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (a character similar to Alexander in many respects) portrayed the complexity of his character, including allusions to his sexuality, with class and in line with the overall storyline. However, Lean was a great film maker. Oliver Stone is many things, but, a great film maker? Me thinks not!!",1116979200,8,969,4.808383233532934
2309808,1,B0009PLLN6,"I'm originally Persian and Know Exact History of my country. The only truth in this movie was that the Persian empire Had 4/5 of the known world of that time!

This movie Shows everywhere exept persia! Babylon was not the original part of persia. in that time it was a country that had been captured by persians, later in the time of partan and sassanid empire, till 18th century it became an original part of persia. persian empire had 3 capitals, perspolis, now near shiraz in iran, ekbatan, now near hamedan in iran and shoush, now near ahvaz in iran. babylon was only a city. not the capital of persia and was never that crowded in that time!

there was several wars in the center of persia, some of them was very heroic that small parts of iranian patriots, stopped alexander army for 6 mounths in the central persia mountains. the main city with huge amount of treasures that alexander captured, was perspolis, near shiraz that was the main capital of persian empire, and he destroyed it. there is no sign of any persian capital in thisd film, I bet oliver stone doesn't know that the persia is iran! in a scene we see him in a battle with persians, and what a ridiculous scen! the worse battle snene i've ever seen. from there, he jumps to babylon and from there, he flies to hindokush and india, what did oliver stone done? he hase changed the history, insulted millions of persian peole, fooled milions of american and world's people, and at the end, he couldn't make too much mony of this freak he made!",1116892800,9,1513,4.518248175182482
2309809,2,B0009PLLN6,"I've never been quite fully convinced of Oliver Stone as an uber-director.  His earlier works would suggest that he is a genius film-maker, but ever since Natural Born Killers, he seems to have a sick fascination with cutting up the film entirely too much in the editing room.  His last three films have suffered greatly (among other reasons) because the editing is too hyper.  In Alexander, the hyper-editing again comes to the foray when we're knee deep in battle scenes in Alexander, of which, disappointingly, there are only two.  The editing is just one piece of this puzzle that Oliver Stone gets wrong.  The second is all of the parental angst that this king/conqueror/man-made demi-god seems to go through.  This man marched through the middle east, Egypt, and all the way to the edge of India, conquering as he went...in a very short span of time too.  Someone who could accomplish such a feat must have had charisma and a voice that could persuade thousands to fight for him.  I would think that people would gravitate to him.  He's almost larger than life, is he not?  And yet...we get none of that, instead we're put through the Fruedian ringer time after time.  Was all of that reall necessary?  And that leads to the casting choice of Alexander:  Colin Farrell.  While I believe Farrell is a very capable actor, I'm not sure that he carries the type of presence required for such a role as this.  Actors like Russell Crowe and Mel Gibson (and to a lesser extent, Clive Owen), are believeable, because, they all carry presence to them.  Perhaps this might be a misjudgment on casting, because, had another director done this movie, Farrell's turn as Alexander might have come out different, say in the hands of someone like...James Cameron or Ridley Scott.  I'd also like to point out that the movie never seems to have a coherent storyline to it.  We're shown bits and pieces of Alexander's life, half of them the wrong ones.  We should have seen more of his conquering spirit and more of the battles that he waged.  Back to the fragmented timeline...one minute we see Alexander getting scoffed at by his father, the next, he's leading 40,000 Greeks against 250,000 Persians in the battle og Guagamela.  What about his conquest of Egpyt and through the Middle East?  It's a shame the editing is hyper, that the timeline is fragmented, that the bits and pieces that ARE shown are not the right ones, that the casting is questionable, because there are ingredients here for an enthralling motion picture.  The sets, costumes, makeup, and some of the other acting, are well done, it's just marred by a complete lack of focus and a questionable lead actor.  Again, I tend to wonder how Colin Farrell would have approached the material with a different director at the helm.  A squandered opportunity for what could have been a great historical epic.  I'd give it 2 and a half out of 5",1116547200,,2894,4.726546906187624
2309810,1,B0009PLLN6,"Suave Actor Colin Farrell (upcoming The New World, Intermission) steps up into the boots of the lead role of Alexander The Great who conquered a lot of places on the map and who has had a difficult life, with his over protective mother, played by Angelina Jolie (upcoming Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Beyond Borders) in a throwaway role...I didn't believe that Jolie could pull off playing Farrell's mother. 'Lexander also when he was a wee one lost his father King Philip, played by the cool Val Kilmer (Mind Hunters, The Doors)...even Kilmer cant pull off anything good. Alexander's story is told by the great low voice of Anthony Hopkins (The Human Stain, Hannibal). We learn that Alexander might have some homoerotic ways, having feelings for his friend, played by Jared Leto (Panic Room, Urban Legend). The empty action picture also stars Rosario Dawson (Frank Miller's Sin City, KIDS) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis '05, Velvet Goldmine). To say this is a masterpiece is surely laughable...it doesnt even hit that mark. Farrell's performance cant make the cut. Oliver Stone sprinkles in some red in a gigantic battle between Elephants...and who needed that red, anyway....I was thinking Alexander Born Killer when that red popped up. A grand failure in many ways though it isn't the worst movie of 2004...it just plain stinks like rotted fish.",1116374400,5,1346,5.040358744394619
2309811,4,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone has proven that the third time is the charm.  His second ""restructuring"" of his 2004 film is much better than the previous two, even with the additional footage.  Stone has crafted a film that is both contemporary as well as traditional as it tells the tale of one of the greatest conquerors in world history.  Perhaps, it is better viewed at home, allowing the viewer to savor the cinematography, the opulent sets, the well-choreographed battle scenes, the magnificent costumes, and the acting, a combination of the over-the-top and the subdued.

Speaking of the acting, many have been critical of Colin Farrell in the title role.  The ""revisitation"" puts his performance in a better balance, permitting one to view his empassioned acting in a different perspective.  Many it's not Oscar-worthy but his take on the historical character is pretty darn good.  He is matched by Angelina Jolie as his mother, Omega, in a most interesting interpretation which must be respected for its uniqueness.  Other outstanding acting turns are given by Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife, Roxane, Gary Stretch as Clietus, Val Kilmer as Phillip, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Jared Leto as Hephaistio, and Conner Paolo as the young Alexander.

The jaw-dropping special effects, especially the re-enactment of the historical battles are stunning.  One can't help but wonder ""How did they do that?"" when watching the battle between Alexander's minions against elephant-riding opponents in the jungles of India.

The movie, in this final incarnation, may not rank among the top-ten greatest epics of all time but it now can lay claim to being a pretty darn good film.",1101513600,,1666,5.17910447761194
2309812,5,B0009PLLN6,"""Alexander Revisited"" is the definitive version of Oliver Stone's underrated film on the life of Alexander the Great. Stone has added almost forty minutes of footage to bring the film's running length to three hours and thirty-four minutes, including an intermission break. The new footage offers some new insight into the characters, but for the most part, allows the audience to breathe more. Scenes are now allowed to flow better, making this a more complete movie experience.
The great performances are made even better with the new footage, and supporting characters are fleshed out even more, especially the character of Bagoas, who we now get to feel for. The new scenes also allow us to feel with the characters emotionally.
Overall, this is definitely the best version of the film! If you didn't enjoy the film before, then you might enjoy this version of it. But if, like me, you did enjoy the previous versions of the film, then you're going to like this version even more! Highly recommended!

2309813,1,B0009PLLN6,"... would have been a more apt title for Stone's horrible post-modernist depiction of this historical collossus for whom no film could really devote enough time to cover all of the facets of his greatness.  This film was doomed from the start with an ill-suited director, a horrible screenplay, a poor script, senseless editing, bad casting, and mediocre acting by most of the main actors.

Oliver Stone was probably the worst choice for an epic historical film as Stone's specialty lies exclusively in the relatively narrow domain of the post-1960s Americana genre.  Stone's greatest talent in direction is with themes reflecting the pop-culture and post-modernist American values found in ""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""Nixon"", or ""Natural Born Killers"", but not historical epics such as the life and times of Alexander The Great.  Stone's closest attempt at filming a historical epic was with ""Conan The Barbarian"" and, because of his inability to competently direct such films, he was quickly reduced to a minimal role by John Milius who took full direction to save the film from certain doom.  In addition to wasting film on simply non-sequential scenes for ""Conan"", Stone actually wanted to use disco for the theme music and Milius ardently insisted on hiring Basil Poledoris to compose the memorable score.  In the case of Alexander, Stone's rather narrow direction skills led to a completely incoherent theme emphasizing on Alexander's homosexuality as being a significant factor to his greatness when it actually wasn't.  As a result, the audience is left with a long film showing Alexander as the hip post-modern psychadelic leader whose main motive for conquering the world was to overcome his insecurity of being gay and spread his gay rights agenda to a desperate and intolerant world.

Stone's emphasis on Alexander's bisexual orientation was simply a wasted opportunity and an inappropriate thematic emphasis as Alexander's motives and achievements had little to do with being bisexual.  Actually, Alexander did not like sexual intercourse at all regardless of whether a man or woman was in his bed.  Stone presents Alexander as a sobbing and confused gay sentimentalist in desperate need for his mother's approval and more concerned about his uncertain relationship with Hephaestion's companioship than with conquering the world.  Although Alexander did have a troubled relationship with Olympias, he was hardly the little insecure boy always coming back to his mother as portrayed by Stone and the film wastes too much time on developing their relationship.  Alexander was all too happy to leave his overly ambitious mother behind and to never see her again after he set off to conquer Persia: their relationship was therefore moot after that point whereas Stone falsely portrays it as an ongoing issue.  This was hardly the case as Alexander was probably the most confident leader in history who knew exactly what he wanted from an early age: to be king of Greece and conquer the world!  This is why Phillip told him when he was young, ""My son, ask for yourself another kingdom for that which I leave is too small for thee!""  In contrast to Stone's distorted depiction, Alexander's motivations for conquering Persia where essentially the same as Phillips which were to, (1) keep the Greek city-states busy fighting the Persians instead of themselves or Macedonia; (2) to control the vastest economic empire in ancient history by taking its treasures and trade routes; and, (3) to take revenge on Persia for their burning of Athens a century before.  The only difference between Alexander and Phillip is that Alexander rejoiced in the thrill of battle, conquest, and exploration a lot more than Phillip's pragmatic approach to politics and diplomacy reflected by his proverbial statement, ""Treat boys with fists and men with oaths!""  Alexander was never really interested in the pragmatic administration of the State and was more than happy to squander his treasures to continue his campaigns of conquest and exploration to the end of the then known world.  Another poor depiction of Alexander by Stone is that of his relationship with Roxeanne.  Stone portrays Roxeanne as Alexander's first wife and of great importance when in fact she was his third wife and the least important of the three.  Alexander married Roxeanne for purely pragmatic reasons and took her more as a hostage than a regal spouse who was to provide an heir to rule his entire kingdom.  Alexander's military resources were being bogged down in Bactria by petty mountain tribes who were carrying out somewhat succesful guerrilla operations against Alexander's forces.  Roxeanne was the daughter of the strongest chieftain in Bactria and so he took her as a bride/hostage to assure her father's good behavior while Alexander went East to conquer India.  Alexander impregnated Roxeanne so that he could in the future establish a direct bloodline to rule that difficult province instead of relying on the whims of local chieftains who had limited alliegiance to him.  The most absurd part in the film is where Alexander is intimidated by Roxeanne and cowers before her like a little boy.  Alexander intimidated!?  I doubt he would have been considered great if that had been true as there would be nothing more disgraceful in that time for a Greek man to cower before a woman of virtually insignificant lineage and a barbarian one to boot.  Please! The film also fails to capture Alexander's genius and grandeur by including his cutting of the Gordion Knot and his crowning as pharao after his visit to Siwa. The plot and theme of this film is also further diluted by failing to develop the perspective of the Persians and Darius III.  The film essentially has no antagonists and therfore no climactic tension to hold any suspense worth speaking of.  In short, the film getting bogged down in Stone's emphasis on Alexander's sexuality completely brushed over these crucial aspects of Alexander's true character and motives as well as the environment he found himself in.  As a result, the audience is left yawning in boredom watching a sobbing and overly gay Alexander who cowered before the women in his life and went conquering the world for self-esteem and to propagate his (or rather Stone's) post-modernist liberal agenda.  It is quite unlikely that Stone's Alexander would have been able to last even a month in leading a vast army of hardened veterans with such a weak personality not to speak of 13 years.

The casting was also poor in the making of this film.  Farrel simply had too little charisma and acting talent to portray Alexander as even the great Richard Burton couldn't pull it off fifty years before in Rossen's film.  In addition, Stone's pointless direction along with the already defective screenplay and defective script utterly ruined any chance for Farrel to act the part of Alexander in a convincing way.  Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer pulled it off best even though Jolie's awkward accent tended to come off more as overacting by an actress who is insecure about her role.  Rosario Dawson was also a terrible casting decision for Roxeanne as the real Roxeanne was caucasian and not black/mulato.  She was also considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world after the women in Darius' family.  Although Dawson is relatively attractive, among the many gorgeous actresses who could have played the part she is certainly not one who generally invokes the sense of being the most beautiful woman in the world by any contemporary standard.  One of the worst performances surprisingly was that of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy whose monotonous narrative cries out ""God! When will I be done with this horrible script!"" throughout the entire film.

Stone limiting Alexander's campaign to just the battles of Gaugamela and Jehlum also didn't justice to the greatness of Alexander who never lost a major battle in his entire military career.  Every conqueror or general who came after him from Caesar to Schwarzkopff felt only disappointment at not being able to come even close to his military greatness.  The battle of Gaugamela is abruptly introduced without showing how Alexander got there after brilliantly defeating Persia at Granicus or Issus.  The film simply shifts from Ptolemy's boring narrative to a bird's eye view of the battle field that illuminates nothing as to Alexander's courage and brilliant tactics. The scenes are nothing but senseless phallanx and cavalry deployments giving the audience no idea as to what is happening on the battle field or what Alexander really did to win the battle.  The depiction of Jehlum was even worse as the battle did not take place in a dense jungle but in a large clearing in the semi arid region of the Indus valley in modern-day Pakistan.  A phallanx formation and cavalry tactics would have been utterly useless in a dense jungle environment and any army using such tactics against Porus' elephants and nimble infantry would have been completely crushed.  As with Gaugamela, what won the battle of Jehlum was Alexander's brilliant use of cavalry outmaneuver Porus' elephants and infantry.  Furthermore, Alexander was not pierce by an arrow in that battle nor did he lose his prized horse Baucephalus: both these events had already taken place previously before he advanced into India.  Stone fails to depict Alexander's brilliant victories and Granicus and Issus and no film has bothered to show his siege of Tyre where he sacked the island citadel with two 3/4 mile jettis that his men built in less than 6 months by sheer herculean effort. The film also falsely portrays Alexander as receiving Darius family for the first time in Babylon when he had actually taken them hostage after the battle of Issus.

This was simply a terrible depiction of Alexander The Great's life in which Stone wasted the entire theme and plot to show how Alexander being gay as a significant factor to his greatness when it wasn't.  Alexander's youthful energy, godlike self-confidence, and sheer military genius were the main factors contributing to his greatness and not his homosexuality.  That is why Alexander is called ""The Great"" and not ""The Gay.""  In truth, I don't think any film medium short of an extended miniseries to the likes of HBO's ""Rome"" would do justice to the complexities of Alexander's character or the impact he actually made on Western civilization and the rest of the world.  To paraphrase Phillip's advice to Alexander, I would tell the audience to go and seek a better film of Alexander for that which Rossen and Stone have left is too mediocre to watch.",1089158400,4,10615,5.0567660550458715

2309817,5,B0009PLLN6,"Misunderstood, chaotic, just as the extraordinary life of the man it portrays. See this version, or the 2007 Revisited final cut. Forget about story structure hollywood conventions, forget about formulaic screenplay guidelines. Oliver Stone has crafted a journey through the oftentimes obscure and enigmatic life of this extraordinary man. The conquest of the spirit, the empires of the mind, the rise, the fall, the broken dreams, the love between men that can raise a city state, that is pure and excellent,  the fear, betrayals, the greeks and macedonians, driven by wonder or by greed, towards the exploration of their known world, and the unknown ones.
Ignore the accents, the age discrepancies. Let narrative pull you in, Vangelis' score, Hopkins' narration, every single scene with Plummer's Aristotle, the accurate insights of Stone himself and Robin Lane Fox. Forget the criticism. Every scene between Philip (Val Kilmer) and young Alexander will fill you up with empathy, tenderness and foreboding dread simultanously. The inevitability of fate, the caves at Pella, the taming of Bucefalus, the ashes of the titans and the ""mortal"" men, the Hindu Kush, Ptolemy's warnings at the foot of the Caucasus, the undying love of Bagoas. This is historic cinema at its most thoroughly researched, yet at its most exquisite and poetic.
Be swept away.

2309822,3,B0009PLLN6,"It`s okey, but I still prefer the theatrical version. Some scenes have alternate shots of differents angles but is practically the same cut as the revisited version with the same problems compared with the teatrical version. In the extended versions the new shots have different light and colours, this is evident in the Battle of Gaugamela, the colours and the golden light is now is now dimmed, dark and bluish, and the sharpeness changes greatly between shots. I would do a plane treatment per plane to give unity and cohesion to all the shots because technically this ultimate version and the revisited leave a lot to be desired in this regard. The theatrical version have more sharpeness in all movie and more quality and the Battle of Gaugamela in the theatrical version is perfect with the shots, the light, the music... I don`t understand why Oliver Stone has erased the scene in the part where the infantry separates to support Alexander at the entrance of the hole and cut the confrontation of Alexander when he gets into the hole... I consider Oliver Stone a good director but I think he lacks common sense.

Otherwise the movie is the same, some parts are better ... but I still consider the theatrical version better because is very bad for the movie introduce Alexander and other characters in Gaugamela without knowing anything about them. And in this ultimate version is cuts off all the part of the part of the strategy deliberation before the battle and the opposition of Parmenion so the viewer who sees this version for the first time will not know that Parmenion is against Alexander. The theatrical version is better with the childhood and the presentation of the characters related to Alexander to go to the moment when Alexander is at his best in Gaugamela after being crowned pharaoh of Egypt and being almost a ""god"", this part in the theatrical version is epic and now the whole epic has been removed from the film with the new cut.

Still, leaving aside artistic issues of assembly and plot, the ultimate version is very technically poor in the quality of blu ray and sharpness, the first theatrical version still wins.",1502064000,2,2147,4.8

In total the film gives a striking and lush portrayal of a world which is far away from ours, before Islam, Christianity and Rome.

I was really quite amazed with this film, though I shouldn't have been (being a fan of Stone's work). The historical Alexander has been compressed into a 3 hour+ film, so the history has been simplified and condensed (perhaps too much), but the result is still a very powerful and emotional work. I especially liked the increased use of Anthony Hopkins' narration (as the elderly Ptolemy) in the Final Cut. It helped explained things that weren't clear in the Director's Cut. The two battle scenes are very graphic and very realistic portrayals of the brutality of combat in the ancient world. Colin Farrell is very appealing in the title role, and Angelina Jolie is deliciously evil as his mother Olympias. Christopher Plummer is a memorable Aristotle.",1483920000,6,896,4.98

2309842,5,B0009PLLN6,"The film deserves greater acclaim than many critics have suggested down the years in my opinion....
A controversial film which brought about echo's of disapproval from both Iran and India...
The story of the legend that was 'Alexander' (Colin Farrell) is told by the now old 'Ptolemy' (Anthony Hopkins)
who'd fought alongside 'Alexander' and witnessed much 40 years past.....
The film begins with 'Ptolemy' having his memory of those times written down by the scribes...
The story of 'Alexander' starts on the battlefield against 'King Darius's' massive force (though in truth they had
many battles before 'Alexander' prevailed) and out manoeuvring the Persian leader and his force, leaving
'Darius' fleeing from the field of battle.
The film frequently switches back to early times depicting events during 'Alexander's' earlier years, his difficult
relationship with his father 'King Phillip' (Val Kilmer) and close, as a child with his mother 'Olympias' (Angelina
Jolie) who repeatedly told him that he was the earthly son of the god 'Zeus' (young Alexander played by Connor
Paolo)
The film see's the Macedonian leader claim great city's such as Babylon as his own, and see's him amid disapproval
from the ranks marrying 'Roxane' (Rosario Dawson) daughter of a Bactrian nobleman...many believing he should
have chosen a 'Macedonian' bride.
We also see 'Alexander's' complex love life, often taking comfort from his male man-servant.
The film with flashbacks shows his father 'Philip' assassinated by one of his guard, was this under the direction of
his mother who had to watch her husband marry another, or was it a conspiracy from the Persian empire who at
that time 'Alexander' was yet to conquer....
We follow the 10 year-long campaign through to his encounters with creatures he and his followers had never seen
the likes of during the India-Campaign.
We see descent creeping into the ranks from those, including many close to him, who believe they should have long
since returned home to their families, through to Alexander's death and the division of the Empire.
The film does obviously flirt with historical fact some, though much of what is portrayed does not stray too far from
the truth, obviously to tell the story properly would require a lengthy serialisation...though, because most of the
historical facts written were lost in fires in the great library of Alexander....only the few shreds of fact and hearsay
remain.
The film, with a superb cast-list, though a little 'Hollywood' is a great spectacle to cherish (despite Alexander having
a strong Irish accent)

2309847,3,B0009PLLN6,"I liked this much-criticized movie enough to buy the dvd, after watching library copies.  I loved the battle scenes; and felt that Val Kilmer performed very well as Philip of Macedon.  The biggest problem was, in my opinion, the utter unsuitability of Colin Farrell in the role of Alexander; made painfully obvious in the overblown writing of the character - if Oliver Stone couldn't figure him out, how can we expect Farrell to do so?  Farrell never seemed at all at ease in the role; except, perhaps, when he isn't talking.  In contract, Connor Paolo, who played the young Alexander (as opposed to the very young Alexander who is seen in a scene with his mother, a snake, and his drunken father), seems totally, gracefully at ease playing preteen Alexander and thus convinces the audience nicely as well as Bucephelos and Philip.",1469404800,2,831,4.830985915492958
2309848,4,B0009PLLN6,"If I had not read so much about Alexander already, I might have gotten confused. Sometimes the script writers are writing speeches instead of following Alexander's life. I bought it because of Fire from Heaven, and Bagoas, the Persian Boy by Renault. The movie borrows so much from the author but does not give credit. Francisco Bosch's Bagoas was a pleasure to watch. I think he was standing in a box to make him look shorter than Colin. Until Bagoas' scenes were added back in, I refused to see it. Colin Farrel actually did a decent job.

After reading all the ballyhoo around how Alexander portrayed as bisexual in this movie, I decided to watch the Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut edition, keeping my expectations low. Initially, Angelina Jolies accent disturbed me a lot. I don't understand why actors feel that they need to have a foreign accent while shooting a historical movie in English. That aside, I think the movie is visually spectacular without too much CGI. Battle scenes were brutal and gripping. The scene where they enacted the Battle of Hydapes with elephants alone is a-must see. Colin Farrell, despite his blond-dye hair (it may grow on you after seeing him in blond hair for three hours), was very good in conveying Alexandars rage, love, sadness, and passion and showing us him as a human rather than a great conqueror.  It is a great historical movie with tremendous work and effort. Probably, you won't see something like that for many years to come. All I can say is that this film, its director and actors don't deserve all these negative criticism that pushed away many viewers. Watch and judge yourself.",1461628800,14,1311,4.954545454545454

2309883,2,B0009PLLN6,"This revised version is as disappointing as the original. Positive reviews focus on this historical accuracy of the film, the cinematography, the sets and the costumes. I agree all of these are top notch. However, if cinematography, sets and costumes make a movie great, then the Starwars prequels would be excellent. As they are not, by modus tollens...

The real weakness of Alexander is the script. The dialogue is generally weak. Alexander is whiny and overly emotional. Ancient homosexuality is portrayed through kisses on the cheek, cheesey professions of eternal love, and obnoxious, longing stares. I doubt this is even an accurate portrayal of modern homosexuality, much less the ancient kind.

The worst flaw of the script, however, is how it treats the subject. First, it focuses on Alexander's desire to knit the many people's of the ancient world together into a single empire, and his Macedonian veterans' contempt for non-Greeks. It ignores the history of the conflict between Greece and Persia, and the fact that so many saw Alexander's campaign as one of revenge for past wrongs. It ignores Alexander's epic and unprecedented military achievements, such as nearly all of the famous battles and sieges (Thebes, Issus, Tyre, etc.). It ignores the famous pilgrimage to Siwah oasis.

Second, the storytelling is disjointed and weak. Putting Phillip's assassination at the end of the movie was a terrible blunder. Much of the dialogue would have been lost on anyone who didn't already know much of the story and at least some greek mythology.

This movie was terribly disappointing. Someone please come and do this story justice!",1445212800,3,1641,5.181132075471698
2309884,5,B0009PLLN6,Oliver Stone is my favorite contemporary director hands down. I've seen every film he's ever made and own most of his films except the doors which wasn't interesting to me and uturn because nither the blu ray nor dvd contain a director's commentary and I make it a point to only purchase films with commentary especially Oliver stone's because he puts so much explanation into his commentaries. Nixon JFK W. Platoon and Natural born killers have the best commentarys by any director. Now on to Alexander. First off I am not a Colin Farrell fan and I don't think he's a very good actor but just eye candy but then again that's what Hollywood is now days nothing but a shallow industry however he's better then people like George Clooney or Di Crapio as I call him. I also don't care for Jared Leto. I also hate midevil epics like braveheart or Robin Hood etc...so your probably wondering why I own three versions of this film plus the ultimate cut blu ray and the simple answer is Oliver Stone. He put spilled his heart out making this film. Putting everything he had into what is a beautiful work of art. The film is beautifully shot and I felt it was a huge injustice to Stone on the way this film was panned and how criticized he was for even making it. As big a fan as I am of his I felt it was my duty to own all copies. The commentarys are all brilliant especially the blu ray version. I've yet to watch the whole film but there's so much history and Stone busted his hump trying to release the perfect version. It was a life long dream of his to make this film and if your a true Oliver Stone fan then I recommend you give this film a chance. I also highly look up to and admire Oliver Stone and he created this film this gift for the world to see so as my gift to him I will continue to buy any other version he releases.

2309895,4,B0009PLLN6,"This was a better movie and more historically accurate than I had expected given the poor reviews when it was released in theaters.  There are aspects of Alexander's life that are very obscure, for example Phillip's death and who was behind it, or whether Alexander died of fever or was poisoned by his generals, or was merely helped along the way by a rival.  These mysteries, salted into the accomplishments and failures of his military career, make the dry facts of his campaigns much more interesting because they bring the great general down to the human level.  Personally, having done some study into Alexander's life, I think Stone did a good job of conveying the known historical facts of his life, while leaving the beloved legend intact.  He does present the open questions, but doesn't really solve them, and let's us draw our own conclusions.  I did find it interesting that Stone treated Alexander's relationships with Hephaiston and Bagoas as fact, rather than glossing over or denying this aspect of his life, as many historians do, shying away from uncomfortable facts to preserve their hero on their own terms.

Farrell is a very good actor and he handled Alexander as a person, a complicated person but a person.  His characterization transcended the script and there were times when you could see that Alexander, for all his genius, was often lacking in emotional IQ and maturity.  Farrell's Alexander believed more in his own legend than in himself, and he allowed those moments of uncertainty to show when Alexander was caught  between them, when he had to reconcile his legend-self to the needs of the real moment.

If you are interested in how warfare was conducted 300 years BC, this is probably a good representation of it.  In many scenes, everyone is covered with blood, even the victors.  It's amazing anyone survived given the state of medicine, infection and the heinous nature  of sword and spear wounds.

So in all, I'd recommend the movie- it's well done, well acted and as close to the historical Alexander as anything I've seen or read.",1436400000,9,2072,4.882857142857143

2309910,5,B0009PLLN6,"This has been my favorite movie since I saw it in the theaters in 2004.  I have bought and viewed every single version of this movie and watched each of them eagerly and enjoyed them all.  My least favorite, of the now 4 versions, was the Director's Cut.  My favorite has always been the original Theatrical version, but this new Ultimate Cut might challenge that.  I enjoyed the Revisited: Final Cut for the fact that everything that was filmed was thrown into the movie, and I love long movies, but that was just too much.  This new version I think is the happy medium.

A lot of people have criticized Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie for their performances, but I feel that this is the greatest performance of Farrell's career.  He shows such a great range of emotion and really understands the magnitude of the character he is playing.  Angelina Jolie has never looked more gorgeous than she did in this film.  The subtlety of her performance and the sexual innuendos were totally sublime.  I also really enjoyed Val Kilmer playing Philip the One Eyed, Alexander's father, he is a greatly underrated actor and really commanded the screen in each and every scene he was in.

The cinematography was excellent and the Blu-Ray HD really makes it look even better!

My one gripe about, what is still to this day my favorite movie, is the flashback structure, it can be very confusing.  In for maybe the 1st hour of the Ultimate Cut they give you the year BC in which the events are occurring and also how many years previous to and/or following the scene before the flashback.  That was quite helpful in keeping the timeline clear.  However after the 1st hour the flashbacks are just marked 7 years earlier, or 10 years later.  That's where it really can get confusing.

Other than that though, I highly enjoy the Ultimate Cut and really feel that this movie along with the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven, the Director's Cut of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, Gladiator, Exodus: Gods and Kings, and Noah are some of the greatest historical epics that have ever been made.  If you are fan of films about ancient history then every movie just listed should be on your Must Watch list!

If you saw the original Alexander and were dubious about it, then by all means please give this new version a shot and keep an open mind!",1430697600,4,2321,4.603406326034063

2309912,1,B0009PLLN6,"While the movie was filmed beautifully, the plot was weak and the dialog was boring and mundane. How you could take someone as innately thrilling as Alexander the Great, and have a huge budget for a movie, and fail so miserably, I don't know, but they did.  We gave up after an hour, it just wasn't worth the time, and wasn't getting any better.  Too much emphasis on clever sidebars, like snakes and gay relationships, and not enough on plot and point.  Did the movie have a point, besides Angelina Jolie can play a crazy paranoid harpy really well?  And Colin Farrell can do gay interest well enough?  I didn't get much beyond that, and that's not enough to hold you for an extra-long movie.  That was worth about 10 minutes.  Not much more than that.",1429315200,2,753,4.492647058823529

After a second go,, it began to grow on me such as Jolie, as his mother; Farrell, cast as Alexander, but my opinion has not changed on Dawson being miscast as Roxanne. Alexander was larger than life so large even the screen cannot contain him, his vision, exploits and campaigns. Actually Oliver Stone was in over his head touching on only some high points. But overall, costumes, sets were great! British actors outstanding in their roles. The Battle of Gaugemela is a bit hard to follow.  But after having recently viewed it twice I would definitely recommend it over Troy.

First, I couldn't get past the soundtrack. It was awful. It would've been awful in 1954, which is how it sounded; as if it was left over from some sword & sandals epic, circa 1954. It was over orchestrated, loud and intrusive. The music just didn't fit the story. Then, the casting. Colin Farrell with blonde hair as Alexander? Really? I'm a huge fan of Colin, Jared Leto, Val Kilmer, and Angelina, but no. NO. Finally the writing. The dialogue was awful. Cringe worthy.  I won't even get into the accents.

2309927,3,B0009PLLN6,"So, I'll just come out and say it - I'm a Classicist by education and at heart. I can't rate this movie a 5, but it is NOT because of the subject matter. It's because there really is NO way to capture the illustrious and complex life of Alexander in 3 hours. He has too many relationships that needed explanation - such as his and Hephaistion's, for instance. Also, I'm sure the relationship portrayed between he and Bagoas shocked many viewers, but there is a need for the start of their relationship to be better displayed. Also, the movie unfortunately portrays Bagoas as just a pretty sex-slave, when he was so much more than that during the campaigns.

While I liked the outcome of basing much of the content on Renault's work in The Persian Boy, I think Arrian and Curtius' works should have been relied upon moreso for their descriptions of Alexander's tactics, strategy and general thought process in war. He was/is known as one of the world's best military leaders, and when the movie ends, we never seem to grasp that reality - instead, we see a tormented man die while surrounded by vultures.

So - I think the attempt is GREAT, but I caution viewers to understand that this movie is only a few select snippets of the life of Alexander - please read other sources to really get the gist of who this man was and the legacy he left.",1420156800,4,1341,4.491803278688525

Despite the crazy dialects (Irish, British, Scots and Angelina Jolie's wildly creative one) and some truly odd casting, I'm glad I saw this.
The scope of the film is huge--33 years across multiple continents and Stone has the flair for an epic.  The battle scenes (which I normally hate) were amazing and the sets--particularly Babylon, are fantastic.

My two favorite characters were Jared Leto's Haphaestion and Christopher Plummer's Aristotle.  The voiceover and continuous presence of Ptolemy provide much-needed continuity.

Because of the sympathetic portrayal of Alexander's bisexuality and the aforementioned strange speech affects, this film won't be for everyone.  But if you like epics or history, it's definitely worth a watch.",1419984000,8,832,5.519685039370079

When you are at sea it is said & a mermaid looks towards you & she asks you Were is Alexander the (kosmokrator)(the one that holds the cosmos)the Great. You must Answer he lives he rules & looks for new conquests. If you do not answer thus she will rip you ship, vessel apart & take your life.  Simple you may say. No even at the ends of the earth his name was known.  PHILIP, his was a strong & brave king that United & took up against Greece's Enemy's That's why it is said Alexander son of Philip minus SPARTA. Because let's be honest after a long while,  casualties , conflicts, battles. "" Phillip said in anger via Messenger if I insist I will level Sparta.""  The Messenger was allowed to live in this....& returned & Phillip said what was the answer. IF!!!. Was the answer Philip loved the Spartans so. The battlefield were he had vanquished the Unbeatable till that day SACRED BAND OF THEBES. After the Battle he sat for hours weeping. Then he looked at his men & said look all of you & lest we forget only Heroes fight like Greeks( this phrase mentioned throughout history WW1, WW2. & The Battle, the most uneven 480 B.C.

2309933,5,B0009PLLN6,"I know this movie was an expensive flop but personally I thought it was terrific and it's one of my favorite films of 2004.

Along the way he falls in love (with men and women) and has to deal with an overbearing mother, a womanizing father, and all the betrayals by his close friends. Colin Farrell's performance is really the main reason to watch Alexander. He is so wonderful and should have gotten an Oscar nomination. I also loved Angelina Jolie in a small role as his mother - she was gorgeous and powerful. Jared Leto was also terrific as Alexander's best friend - the only person who truly loved him.

2309940,5,B0009PLLN6,"Deeming the original theatrical release of Alexander to be a 3 1/2-star film (out of 5), I must say I am astounded at the drastic improvement ""The Final Cut"" is. For anyone who disliked the theatrical release, trust me, viewing this re-edited version should redeem most of what left you originally feeling disappointed.

I'm sure we can all remember films we've seen which leave us thinking, ""Damn, that all the makings of a great film, but it just didn't come together."" You know that feeling, right? Well not only did the original release of ""Alexander"" give me that disappointed/cheated feeling, but I hoped the film would be re-edited, or released in an extended edition. If you've seen this film, chances are pretty good you've also seen ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and both of these films' theatrical releases left me frustrated with that ""what-could-have-been"" feeling. However, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was thankfully released in a FAR more satisfying Director's Cut that beautifully tied-up the poorly-edited original version. With ""Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut,"" Oliver Stone quite simply saved and resurrected this film to a magnificence I never anticipated for this film.

Are there just simply added scenes or added useless dialogue to extend the length of the film? No. Certain scenes are extended, characters' dialogue is added to, new scenes were also included, but believe me when I say that not one second was wasted. All of Oliver Stone's addendums served to not only make certain characters' roles more profound and meaningful, but they overall enriched a film that at times, felt paper-thin and rushed in it's theatrical release. For instance, the Persian slave boy Bagoas's added influences in this film made him more than just an additional lover to Alexander. Even Aristotle's few additional lines served to enhance his presence as far more than what originally felt like a Christopher Plummer cameo. Several characters thankfully underwent this important transformation, thus adding a personality the film used to lack.

Stone also went back to the editing table and he hit an absolute mammoth home run in so doing. There are several scenes shifted around, extended, shortened, new scenes added and it all makes for a smooth-flowing film that so exceeds the original, that it's a shame this version won't be viewed nearly as often.

Again, if you were disappointed by the theatrical release of ""Alexander,"" give the Revisited Final Cut a chance. It is the satisfying epic that was intended.",1412812800,4,2508,5.1547911547911545

Although I admit that certain parts are inaccurate to his life, it was overall a really good telling of the historical icon. I am very happy that they made this peticular version of the film because the theatrical version was not as informative as this one. Colin Farrell portrays Alexander wonderfully! If your a true Oliver Stone fan and love historical and very in-depth films, then this is definitely worth every cent you pay for it and the time you will take to watch it in its entirety.

The more you know about Alexander, the more you'll get out of the movie.  If you take it in passively, A LOT of it doesn't make complete sense.  If you know the historical context and thus, the significance of the events, this film is very rewarding.  Stone has done a great job expanding what was a bit messy before ... Jared Leto is unforgettable as Alexander's soul mate, Hephaestian.  Angelina Joile is a HOT mess as Alexander's mother, but only in a truly wonderful way, and Colin Farrell adds touches of real humanity to a historical figure typically depicted as a brute, albeit a brilliant one.  The scenes with these three really make the movie for me.  I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did.  All of the nay-saying has a relatively common root, especially noticeable once you watch the movie and feel the full impact of the story.  As an academic, I'll say no more.

2309958,5,B0009PLLN6,"Spectacular! Engrossing! Mesmerizing! This depiction of the life of legendary - Alexander the Great, is nothing short of like he was, colossal. Actor Colin Farrell is outstanding in his portrayal of Alexander, the son of King Philip of Macedonia and a cold, self-centered, superstitious mother, who kept insisting that Alexander was actually the son of Zeus, the head of the Greek mythological gods. From his childhood, his mother kept pitting him against his royal father, Philip. Torn between loyalty too the two of them, Alexander finds life long love and friendship with his trusted military officer and adviser - Haphastian, as played by Academy Award winning Actor, Jared Leto. Later however, he marries a Eurasian woman, so as to breed an heir to his throne. Alexander did what no other mortal man and certainly no young man of his age (25), had ever done before or since. That being: He conquered and mastered two Kingdoms: Greek/Persia and the whole of Asia. With what historians estimate to be about 40,000 soldiers to avenge his father's untimely murder, Alexander faced the greatest military force of 250,000 plus men... and the whole of the Persian Empire, and defeated them in quick timing. He so devastated and utterly vanquished the vast 200 year old empire and their King Darius, that he made the City of Babylon, it's opulent palace and his enemies' throne, his own, new, regal headquarters. Being only 25 years old, he alone was the undisputed King of Macedonia and of all the once-scattered, now united, Greek city states and the new Emperor of the enormous and vast, Persian Empire. And, this one-time pupil of Aristotle the Philosopher, amassed wealth beyond any one's imagination. Alexander the Great, a visionary and self-motivated, conquering pioneer whose achievements and ambition knew no bounds or fear, made such a profound mark on history that his presence is still vividly felt, even today. His unthinkable and untimely death at 32, sent shock waves throughout Europe, Asia and parts of Northern Africa. Yet, it birthed his legend and a foundational place among history's ""Great's!"" And as usual, Director Oliver Stone does an absolutely magnificent job of bringing ALEXANDER REVISITED to the big, uncensored, reality screen, complete with all the pomp and circumstance that befits royalty. Along side, enthralling and horrific battle scenes which finally solidified Alexander's throne and expanded it, as well. This movie from start to finish, is superb! However, due to the graphic and bloody battle scenes and adult depictions of hetero and homosexual nudity and it's sexual expression thereof, this version is for mature audiences, only.

I won't get too deep with the actual story (although I think it rocks!), and stick to why you should own this specific version - but also the downsides.  PRO: The movie is great quality, and the Final Cut really gives depth to the story and character of Alexander.  Oliver Stone did an amazing job at this version.  I especially love the 2 big battles, with the different viewpoints (Right, Left and Center).  This was great to see what it would be like to be a soldier in that exact position - and I think really adds to the hype.  I like to watch those battles over and over again, especially the elephant attack.  CON: It would be great if you could identify exactly what scenes were added, extended, cut etc.  (Like in the Extended Version of the Hobbit and LOTR films).  It really falls down to bonus content.  Their is a great introduction by Oliver Stone, but aside from that you don't get anything.  I'd hate for him to release a 4th version of the film, but seriously, I think he could come up off of some bonus materials for his final masterpiece.

2309969,1,B0009PLLN6,"I have not seen the director's cut, but it is hard to imagine that anything could save this cinematic disaster. Director Stone's first movie (Platoon) was at his best and he should have quit when he was at the top of his game.

He has been known to distort movies historically, Hollywood license, but he absolutely butchered the historical facts in his attempt to portray, perhaps the greatest military figure of all time. In Robert Rossen's version (circa 1955), Richard Burton played Alexander. He brought intelligence, an iron will,  a sense that he was destined to fulfill his unlimited ambition. Burton was supported by a strong script and accomplished actors. In Stone's version, we have Alexander played by Colin Farrell, who does not have Burton's substance and is totally miscast here.

The battle scenes were poorly staged and historically inaccurate. Stone thought he could fool his uninformed audience by fighting ""The Battle at the Hydaspes"" in a jungle when actually it was fought along side a river bed on a flat plain.

Overall, a very disappointing attempt in every aspect to capture and relate the story of one of the greatest figures in the history of mankind.",1405123200,3,1179,4.969543147208122

Looks like Stone had a gigantic budget and, and hes a decent enough director that he could have produced a respectable historical epic, if he hadnt been so caught up in being the rebel with a misplaced cause. Hint, the most interesting thing about Alexander the Great was not who he batted his eyes at. And Colin Farrells portrayal of him couldn't inspire a couple of privates to take their hands out of their pockets while on parade. Stone probably ruined the chances of Hollywood making another historical epic for the next 50 years or so. Instead, well get more comic book dreck like 300, with a cast of seven actors and a green screen. Or Troy, where some five-and-dime script writer though he/she could improve on Homer by re-writing the parts of the timeless tale that might confuse the audience they were striving for.

2309991,1,B0009PLLN6,"Really, this is supposed to be a REVIEW section. Since it isn't released yet, none of us should be posting comments. With that said, since everyone else is sharing their opinions, I'll throw my hat into the ring. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut' on Blu-Ray. I also own the 'Theatrical' and 'Director's' cuts on DVD. A fourth version is just getting ridiculous (the most recent cut even says ""Final"" in the name), especially after reading the reasoning which I will share below from [...]

""Director Oliver Stone spoke of this new Ultimate Cut:

  On Alexander, I released a shorter version [in theaters] because of Warner Brothers issues. And I [was] also rushed. [When] I released the directors cut  it wasn't called a directors cut . It was called The Final Cut because [earlier] there was a rushed directors cut that I was responsible for. My third version three years later in 2007 was called A Final Cut and I actually added forty some odd minutes  which I think makes the film better.

  Ive been asked by Warner Brothers because they did so well with The Final Cut . They actually sold more than a million copies. Theyve asked me to go back next year and do a fourth version.

  I want to cut it down now because I added too much. I want it to come back a little bit. Theres some trimming [needed].""

This shows that ""The Studio"" simply wants to make more money while capitalizing on the 10th Anniversary. Although I understand they are in the business to make money and there are always anniversary releases, we, the consumer, can dictate some decisions by these greedy companies by not purchasing multiple releases. As a director/movie maker, your original vision of a film may be compromised due to time constraints, budget and studio interference. Mr. Stone had the opportunity to make the film he really wanted with Alexander Revisited. Now the only reason he's going back is because the studio wants to make more money. Sometimes you just have to leave the film alone and move on. This is starting to look like Star Wars and George Lucas whom couldn't stop ""tweaking"" his original trilogy. They wonder why people illegally download movies; perhaps it's because of all the double, triple and quadruple dips. $45 is also pretty damn expensive when I bought all 4 Indiana Jones movies on Blu-Ray during Amazon's Gold Box deal for $30.",1397001600,9,2369,4.748780487804878
2309992,5,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander The Great has always been one of my favorite rulers from ancient histotry.  This is a great version of the film - especially those extended scenes between Alexander and the than who loved him the most. and Bogoas - the beautiful Persian Boy.

2309993,3,B0009PLLN6,"The movie was good but not great. The best parts were like a roller coaster ride. War scenes were outstanding as were the sets and spectacular locations. The bad was the missed opportunities to add depth to the story line, battles and characters. If you see Richard Burton's portrayal in Alexander you see the big picture. You see in Richard Burton's portrayal as a warrior/leader with little attention paid to his sexual orientation. It wasn't important to the plot but it was in Alexander Revisited. Audiences dig the battles and the chess games that are played to win those battles (300 spartans) and they like the contrasting good and bad characters that add suspense to a movie.",1395705600,3,683,4.846153846153846
2309994,1,B0009PLLN6,"There are a few positive things about this movie, which I'll mention first.

The battle scenes are as chaotic and bloody as one might imagine an actual battle would be in those times. What I found interesting was the labeling of the lines, such as ""Macedonian Center"", etc., plus the sweeping aerial shots in the desert scene, so one had the sense of strategy on the battlefield.

Costuming, armor and the depiction of cities such as Babylon appeared to be historically accurate, or at least attempted to do so.

However, I think the memory of Alexander the Great would have been better served if there were more exposition of the battles and the strategies employed by Alexander which got him to the starting point of the movie, the Battle of Gaugemela. Given the length of this version, it was disappointing that so little attention was given to Alexander's mind, and deep understanding of tactics.

Instead, we were subjected to a soap opera of love and intrigue, of high emotions and sub-plots, which degraded the victories of Alexander almost to the level of ""luck"". The constant pedal point of sexuality, bi-sexuality, homosexuality and an (implied) incestuous relationship between Alexander and his mother, was a diversion from the story of the history of Alexander's accomplishments.

The music had the potential of conveying great moments in a warrior's life; moments of humanity and true nobility of spirit. However, it was underutilized throughout.

The accents were ridiculous - WHAT is that accent of Jolie's??! It really started to get on my nerves. We hear others with Irish brogues or cultivated British accents. What the heck?!

And the camera work - don't get me started! The extreme close-ups, over and over again, are also tiresome. Do we really need to see the pores in their faces and their nose-hairs??? And, in the India battle scene, after Alexander is wounded, all of a sudden we're thrown back into a 1960's LSD-type effect of wild colors and sharp contrasts, which very nearly had me expect to hear ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" at any moment. ""Wha-a-a-a-a-a-  the---?!""

And, I have to agree with other reviewers re: the flashbacks. Although the years are subtitled, and Anthony Hopkins' voice over gives some context, it is overall very disjointed and truly doesn't function in the telling of a story.

I was very disappointed in this movie; it had so much potential to truly be great; to bring a bit of Alexander - the concepts of strategic warfare and nation-building (and LIBRARIES!) - to present generations.
At the end, despite some interesting observations by Hopkins' Ptolemy, we are still left wondering, ""SO....uh, what did Alexander do and HOW DID HE DO IT?

Hollywood is a poor substitute for actual history; it were better that we visit our local library, and crack open a book or two to glean some of the wisdom from Alexander the Great's life.",1395619200,,2885,4.940082644628099

2310011,5,B0009PLLN6,"First off, I did enjoy this movie, aside from seeing Colin Farrels balls it was a great movie. What many do not understand is that there are different views as to the personality of Alexander depending on which historian you read or what culture is telling stories about him. For instance in Persia he is equivalent to the boogie man for children. The historian Arrian portrays Alexander as a hero, and in many aspects he was. Rufinius portrays him more as a tyrant given to excess. Stone had a monumental task at hand, trying to blend these all together to try and form a cohesive mix of all these views.

Alexanders hair was described as being like ""The mane of a lion"" so he is portrayed in that sense accurately. He was said to have two different colored eyes, this is not shown in the film. Arrian describes him as a man of great restraint, not given to excess, and this makes sense because he was tutored by Aristotle for many years and was a firm believer in Aristotles teachings. As for drunkenness, you have to remember that the drinking water was not exactly on par with todays standard and therefore many people drank wine instead of water. In Macedonian culture they mixed wine and water, the sulfites in the wine would usually ensure that no bacteria or protazoa would survive.

I did not particularly care for the portrayal of Alexanders father, Phillip II. He was a brilliant man that took the throne in Macedonia when it had no army and virtually no resources. He redefined warfare by creating a Phalanx that was more mobile, easy to train, and a longer pike at about 18ft long. He was described as charismatic and well spoken and that he was always ""clear headed."" Only his enemies described him as being a drunk womanizing homosexual. This was only an attempt to demonize Phillip because Macedonia was hated by the other Greek states. That being said I still think Kilmer did a great job with what he was given.

People should relax and read some history before they criticize the movie. It is not 100% accurate but Stone clearly tried and this movie is more accurate than, say, Agora which was so full of lies I literally got sick to my stomach. But, you have to remember, some history is debatable, especially when there are conflicting sources so you cannot expect a movie to be 100% accurate given that. Stone did not pick one source and say, ""This is Alexander"" he clearly did his research and did his best to portray him using all sources available.",1389398400,5,2473,4.590497737556561

It's a very ambitious, brilliant undertaking. Through the three characters portrayed by Farrell, Leto & Dawson, it's obvious that no expense has been spared. It's a beautiful, luscious film. Mr. Stone obviously, still, is very attracted to the subject of ""alternative"" sexual subject matter for his films, but, fears its possible negative effects on box office receipts, as well as his standing within the world of cinema, in this case, a strange tale of art meeting life. I recommend viewing the film at least three times. First, with the sound on. Next, with the sound off, to learn of the construction and craft of the imagery.

The movie starts with a big battle in which I didn't know which side to root for. After that it jumps back and forth in time so often you need a degree in Math to figure out where you are. Not that I mind jumping around in time so much, but I couldn't really see the point, other than this is an Oliver Stone movie and therefore must be Artistic. Everyone talks like they are quoting some sacred book of Important Thoughts. Anthony Hopkins wanders around as a sort of narrator, trailing ancient reporters. I love Angelina Jolie's accent; she also does wonderful things with snakes. Val Kilmer hammed it up so bad I couldn't wait for him to get killed. There seemed to be a lot of fuss about Alexander's homosexual inclinationsas if this is really controversial in a culture that founded pedophilia. Alexander, it seemed, had sex with almost anything that moved. Frankly, I was much more upset about the horse dying. That was an awesome horse. And Jared Leto should have had more lines.
After three and a half hours of this I had to wonder: why is Olive Stone so enamored of Alexander the Great? He was, after all, a power-mad, philandering conqueror, everything Stone usually hates. His attempt to lionize a brutal dictator falls flat, eventually. Even Oliver Stone can't bend the truth enough to make this movie believable.",1388102400,,1581,4.666666666666667

I decided to view the homoerotic film Alexander co-written and directed by Oliver Stone (who sullied the memory of the classic 1932 film Scarface with the profanity/violence-laden overload pile of cow dung known as Scarface, made in 1983) since it was free, and I wouldn't have to pay for it. The acting is good (with Angelina Jolie getting the best lines and moments), and Colin Farrel is decent as the Macedonian king whose epic conquest of the world defined history forever. There is simply too much jumping around in time, whereas the film could/should have been told one of II ways: either chronologically, or in flashback. I do commend the use of Greek at the beginning, then the subtle morphing into English for the opening titles. I do not recommend this movie.

Also, it seemed to focus only on the gossipy parts of Alexander's life.  Sure he no doubt had a male lover and a mother into snakes and black magic- which is great to include, but the movie makes the actual campaigns and strategies an afterthought.

2310032,2,B0009PLLN6,"For the longest time. I was curious as to why Alexander the Great was panned by critics and audiences. After all, it was being directed by Oliver Stone and had some strong, star power backing it. My curiosity had to be satiated and in the end I lost 3 hours of could have been doing something else.

So before you, dear viewer dare to challenge yourself into watching this movie. Let's break down where it fails, perhaps sway you to turn back now.

1.) It was off to a promising start. Anthony Hopkins set up the scene and made me curious as to how this adventure was going to start. Another 20 minutes of rambling later, and I found myself wanting the movie to get on with it already! So here's your first problem: The movie prefers to TELL you what happened rather than show you. All the major campaigns that would have been wonderful to see on the screen are glossed over and talked about, rather than shown. The way this movie was edited together makes it difficult for the viewer to get invested in the characters.

2.) Poor, poor, editing. I have no idea why in the world they decided to show the murder of Alexander's father until the last leg of the movie. The scene was a critical part in showing you WHY Alexander decided to go conquer some countries, but the viewer is left clueless for most of the movie. The way this movie was put together basically made it impossible to feel any empathy for the characters. You just don't care, because you don't get to know them well enough, which leads to the next problem.

3.) Character development. What character development? You really don't get a sense for how the characters feel or get to know their personality. You can't really tell the generals apart except by their special effects make up. My biggest problem was Hephaiston. For someone who claims to have been in love with Alexander, he sure didn't seem too upset when Alex started taking wives and sleeping with other people. The character SHOULD HAVE GIVEN A DAMN or said something, or we should have seen of scene of him reacting negatively to it.

Instead, he's forgotten about for chunks of the movie, brought in for some lines, disappears again, comes back, rinse and repeat. There is no development, no change, the character remains stagnant. Everything is just too segmented, and by the time the characters DO change and start to betray Alexander, you pretty much end up asking yourself, ""Who are you again?""

4.) Collin Farrell was a terrible casting choice for Alexander, period. The way he looked in his armor, the way he chose to portray the character, the goofy faces he made in the movie, his oddly short stature. Completely failed to represent someone who is supposed to be a God among men. There was nothing inspiring about him, nothing that made ME want to follow him into battle, nothing that told me why this character would be great. Absolutely terrible acting, Angelina was a failure too. Her accent felt fake and she hammed it up throughout the whole movie. Oddly, Val Kilmer's Phillip was a more relatable and enjoyable character. He had depth and was portrayed fairly well, if only those other two followed his lead. Anthony Hopkins is more of a narrator, so he did his part fine.

5.) When Alexander and Hephaiston had their ""moment"" in the balcony. It was one of the most cringe worthy acting scenes I've ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. They didn't kiss or anything like that, the dialogue was just so, so bad. Youtube it if you're curious, but don't watch the movie because of it.

6.) This is probably the most important part. The movie fails to make you CARE. You have all this rich material to create an incredible tale of an astonishing man. And instead, the movie just kind of prattles on and meanders. There's no real emotional impact, there's no wow moment, there's no character arc, there's no plot twist, there's no heart pounding moment. It's all just completely and utterly flat.

In the end, this could have been a great and interesting story about one of history's most interesting people. Instead, it's just a boring, plodding documentary that fails to cause the audience to do anything except yawn.",1384214400,3,4162,4.644021739130435

2310058,5,B0009PLLN6,"This movie will appeal most to those with a genuine interest in western history that still possess a sense of the ""great-man"" view of history that Greece, Rome, and Western Europe believed in for millennia. It tells the story of one of the greatest, or luckiest and most talented, of men from probably the greatest culture that ever existed.

It's a movie that will age well, as do most movies that deal in world-historical themes with a serious eye, and with due reverence toward recreating the time and place in which events unfold.

Some facts are altered, time is ""compressed"" at places, but come on: this was a feature film. For what it is, this film succeeds wonderfully. Yea, perhaps a 14-part documentary series could have told the story more accurately, but documentaries being what  they usually are, the quality of the reenactments would be much worse and we would be without the stirring performances of all the actors involved.

All history is interpretation, some say, and Oliver Stone gets right down to the grit and grist of documented history to create his explanation of what lay behind Alexander's meteoric rise to conquer so much of the world. Undertones of historical forces, Freudian psychology, powerful ancient Greek culture--it's all there, and it forms a beautiful mosaic with which to contemplate Alexander the Great. No one interpretation is ever correct, but then this movie seems to be about each individual contemplating one other, a great one.

So make of it what you will. It was panned by critics and didn't perform well at the box office, but the performances are great and the events and characters intriguing to those with an interest in the history. And it will age well, being a paean to the great ancient Greek culture that will always be an example to all peoples, and to the great Western ideas that were spread far and wide thanks to Alexander the Great.",1382054400,2,1897,4.842592592592593

2310079,4,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander was the most charismatic over-achiever in human history and no one has ever been able to capture that on film - although many have tried. This was Oliver Stone's 3rd attempt at getting it right and he didn't. I understand he is re-cutting it for a 4th time but he doesn't understand that his biggest problem was that he started with the wrong actor. Colin Farrell is NO Alexander. He is unappealing, overwrought, and just plain hopeless at his attempts to bring this larger than life figure to the screen. The 2nd biggest problem is that Alexander accomplished too much in his short life to ever be portrayed in even a 4 hour film - a 12 hr. mini-series might be enough for the high points. As a result, there was a great deal left out, or so compressed that it became confusing. The secondary actors were interchangeable to the point where even informed viewers had trouble telling one from the other. The actress who played his wife - I've blocked out her name - was just plain awful on every level. Even Antony Hopkins in his cameo role looked lost. The only actors who did a professional job were Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer as Alexander's parents. However, if Stone had dropped the whole ""child as the father to the man"" psychobabble and just concentrated on Alexander as an adult it would have been a better use of the time.

It's a shame that one of the most fascinating stories in history is apparently too complex for anyone to put into coherent terms on film. For ancient history enthusiasts, the film is worth seeing even just to groan over the countless mistakes. For the less historically inclined, there are some interesting action and battle sequences. There is little character development and perhaps that is the greatest loss. Alexander was not just a King and conqueror. He was a statesman, diplomat, and builder. A lover of music, literature and drama. A man who spread the civilized arts throughout most of the known world and the 1st man ever to try to bring all of his peoples together to form one great empire in which they could all be equal citizens. His story deserves to be told - this film didn't do it.",1377388800,2,2144,4.597911227154047
2310080,4,B0009PLLN6,"I saw this film on thanksgiving. I really liked many elements about the film. However, I can see what people are saying about the accents. Practically for the first quarter, I had to try to figure out or ask my friend what the characters were saying. They were laying on the accents so heavy, and by the way they did soung all like irish accents, that well what can I say. With the withholding of emotion between Alexander and his ""lover"", I believe that might have created a detachment from the viewers perspective. I you want to indulge into his sexuality... THEN DO IT, don't play with the audience or better yet do go puritanical after choosing to focus on the sexuality and male to male relationship of the characters. I'm sure the did a lot more tan just embrace. Pushing an Agenda as others say... why not, but If you are going to go there, be like President Bush, determined and resolved to dig into his homosexual side, which we all got by the beginning what he had going on.

The film however was BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED AND PHOTOGRAPHED. I'm not sure about Colin in the lead for this film, but he seemed to be more comfortable in his role in the second half of the film. Also, the film could have been trimmed a good half hour. After a while, I started to look at my watch (which is not a good sign) in as much as I was gripped into the story. I'm sorry we live in time were Mr. Stone or the studios executives might have failed in fully doing what they seem they were set out to do off the back which is to tell the story of the Great Alexander as well as his personal romantic interludes. However, I commend all of the people who helped to bring this project to fruition. I understand how hard it is to put a film together, whether its 100,000 or 200 million.

Simply put, the battle scenes are amazing and well done. They are the highlights of the movie. Considering how there's two battles scenes in a 3+ hour movie, sitting through everything else is a chore.

2310090,2,B0009PLLN6,"Strange and confusing. Storyline jumps back and forth constantly. Alexander's hair is not blond but yellow - with black roots. Angelina Jolie is very good at playing herself but the Soviet accent is grating. The few battle scenes are mere sideshows between Alexander ogling one or another of his generals. The Macedonian kings (Philip and Alexander both) prefer to rape their women. There is no intelligible storyline and there are way too many men wearing eyeshadow and mascara; all the women have pouting lips - the Botox fad in full bloom. And, blimey, what's with the Irish accents? Hollywood has got cinematography, lighting and costumes down pat, but much more is expected. The most pathetic aspect of this curvaceous mess is why Oliver Stone keeps getting these budgets to purposely fake history and why some insist on revising said history as if everybody is way too stupid to notice. Shootout on the Titanic? Why not. Who's gonna tell on us? Did Alexander really bed his generals? Inquiring minds want to know...Actually, they're all so cute, even Casanova might stray. There are more than a handful of statues with projecting specimens, some artfully framed below the neck and above the ankles, and one man gives another a gorgeous ring (eat your heart out, Kate Middleton!) so all the bases seem covered. Why, even Alexander's jewels are quickly visible - from behind, no less - in one prelude with a Greek (actually Babylonian) Kouros. The music, too, is sensitive - inappropriate, but caring. No 24 year old women could possibly be made nervous by any of this. (but clearly even Hollywood can't pull the cash unless they get repeat attendance by that most diabolical segment of the population - men! Wonder why they never went back?) The thought that hundreds of people spent time preparing and post-producing this is why paying for a legitimate copy of this movie is depressing - do we really want those people gainfully employed in doing this? I am pretty, oh, so pretty, I am pretty and happy and... Do you know, if this Alexander could kiss himself how wonderful that would be? His mother would be jealous, too. Val Kilmer was in this? Really? Where? Gloria Steinem wrote a piece once, ""If Men Could [Bleed]"" - I thought Lexy got his period, what with all that mess in the beginning and him coming of age and riding that horse and his mother buttering him up as a proper girl should be and him biting his lip like William Jefferson Bligh Clinton once did... and the dancing girls, and the Bactrians, and Chris Plummer and Tony Hopkins and that Roxane babe and Sting must have sung of her for sure since she was... rememberable... and Tony Hopkins won't shut up for more than a minute and the Babylonian Kouros and Lexy in the jungle and so on!

The Director's Cut was alright, but this Final Cut did the same thing for me that the Director's Cut for Kingdom of Heaven did:  I watched it and went, ""Now this is what they meant to show!  This makes more sense!""

Stone went for the heart and for the glory that Alexander was in life, start to finish, and to me, he did not disappoint in this Cut.  It's kind of funny to me, that the reviews I've found for this movie always seem to:  1) glorify Val Kilmer's performance [and it was good], 2) vilify Angelina Jolie's performance [I found her true to Olympias, who always seemed to have an agenda], 3) complain about the homosexual tendencies [do you know ANYTHING about Alexander or ancient Greece?], and 4) moan about the movie being boring [how the hell is a war movie boring?]  Kilmer as Phillip II was amazing; I alternately hated Phillip and felt him tender at the same time, and Kilmer doesn't usually do it for me, but he was AWESOME in this role.  Jolie--I always like her acting, and to me, she did the snake worshipping Olympias justice, even if the snake worshipping Olympias was weird unto herself; one thing is for certain-- she loved her son... how is a different story.  Farrell's Alexander was amazing, but then again, I'm not sure that Colin Farrell has a bad turn of a role, usually it's a script that gets him.  Leto as Hephaistion was beautifully done, and I'm not usually a Leto fan when it comes to him and movies.

How the hell do people find a movie about conquering the world boring?  Especially when, as Aristotle puts it in the movie, ""the known world"" was pretty small?  Alexander was way ahead of his time, and to watch his destiny unfold before his eyes, to watch each decision he made, whether or not it was one everyone agreed with, affect the WORLD, had to be mind-blowing.  Ptolemy spoke of his death at the end of the movie, saying that ""Alexander's great heart finally gave out.""  I think that was a perfect way to describe it:  from what I've read from Plutarch and Arrian and Curtius-- people who never met the man, but relied on writings we've mostly never seen to make their own-- Alexander had such a big heart and such a keen mind for strategy, and when he put those two together, there was nothing he couldn't accomplish.

Stone and Farrell captured that perfectly in this film.",1362700800,2,2386,4.496519721577727

But Alexander Re-Visited, the Final Cut, is a masterpiece of cinema. The performance of Colin Farrell, from a young man to his death, the changes in his appearance, his emotional range, are just exceptional.  So is Angelina Jolie in her role as his mother, Olympia.  The real Olympia was far worse than the one presented in the film.  This version follows historical events fairly closely, and the two battle scenes - which represent more than a dozen that the real Alexander fought - are bloody and brutal.  But it is through these were see Alexander's ability to enthuse his men, to lead, to plan and even to read the landscape, the daylight etc.  While some might find the gay scenes awkward, the real Alexander is believed to have been bi-sexual, which was nothing controversial in those times.  Vangelis' music is brilliant.  Like Cleopatra, this film, in time, will be viewed as the classic it really is, and as close to history as it could get.  I live in Sydney, Australia, which at present has an Alexander exhibition at a major museum.  This exhibition is so close to the film's story that it is uncanny.

2310107,5,B0009PLLN6,"I have been a fan of ""sword and sandal"" movies since the late 50's. I think this is one of the very best, but you probably need to be somewhat knowledgeable of the historical background to truly appreciate it. Alexander is presented as a man of his time and culture rather than as a modern hero, which might be off-putting for some viewers. The film gets unusually high marks for historical accuracy and, inevitably, the story is too complex and full of paradoxes and uncertainties for nice straightforward storytelling - another negative from the standpoint of the ""entertain me"" moviegoer. However, it is a feast for the fan of ancient history and the sets and battle scenes are mind-bogglingly good. The acting is uneven, but Farrell pours his heart and soul into the role and deserves the highest accolades.

Yes, the movie, like its subject, has numerous flaws. It is unwieldy, there are probably too many flashbacks and melodramatic moments. But there are many scenes that I will never forget - and have not forgotten since I saw the original version in the theater. I think Ptolemy said it best: (paraphrasing) ""Oliver Stone's Alexander is a failure, but his failure towers over the successes of others."" It is probably impossible to do justice to Alexander the Great's life in a movie, but Stone came closer than I would have thought possible.",1357776000,,1351,4.848484848484849
2310108,2,B0009PLLN6,"According to the French-Swiss film director, Jean-Luc Godard: ""A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end - but not necessarily in that order!""  It has become commonplace for a film to start at the end, go back to the beginning and then proceed chronologically to the end of the story.  But Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" starts at the end, goes to the middle, and then flip-flops back and forth until it finally catches up with the end.  Thus there are not only flashbacks but also flash-forwards.

Classicists will easily spot the historical gaffes and misquotes.  For example, ""Fortune favours the bold"" only dates to the second century BC.  And Porus' response in India to Alexander's question ""How would you like to be treated"" is transposed, mutatis mutandis, to Darius' daughter Stateira in Babylon.

But for me, the most irritating aspect of the whole film is the deliberate use of a babble of regional accents from all over the British Isles.  Consequently, I bought the Blu-ray ""Alexander Revisited The Final Cut"" from Amazon deutschland which has audio in both English and German.

Finally, a memorable quote from a 2004 film critic: ""There are some highlights in this film but most are in Colin Farrell's hair.""",1357689600,3,1229,4.927184466019417

The real issue is that this is a jumbled up mess of a movie. The story jumps back and forth in time with little context for what is happening. It has a large cast of characters with names that are unfamiliar to American ears and does little to make many of the supporting characters stand out as individuals so it's often confusing as to who is doing what and why. Stone spends most of the movie minimizing Alexander's relationship with Hephaestian as much as possible but then has to quickly set things up so that Alexander's grief makes some sort of sense.

Regardless of Oliver Stone's politics he makes great films and indeed is an American treasurehouse - I feel Platoon, about the Vietnam war, is the best war movie ever made.

It would be interesting to compare Alexander to The 10 Commandments starring Charlton Heston. The film Alexander is quite violent. Perhaps not too much so. In the 10 Commandments, when Moses, played by Heston, when he kills one of the Pharoh's servants, he gently wraps a whip around his neck and the actor lays his head back. He's killed in a symbolic way - that's all that's shown.",1350777600,,724,4.65625

This was like an over-budget, badly dressed, epic-length gay pride picture.  The hair and acting and accents were bad enough.  The portrayal of all these supposedly great warriors flitting around, making googly eyes at each other, and referring to ""armies of beautiful boys"" would have been comically cheesy--except that this movie was supposed to be a serious epic, so instead of comically cheesy it was awkard and painfully embarassing.  Young men belly dancing, young men in heavy eyeliner professing their undying love for each other, young men bent over banquet tables getting spanked in front of 100 other men...where's the actual story line?  It seems like homosexuality is the entire focus of the film, and they used the guise of a historical epic to fly it under the mainstream radar to the big screen.  There was no plot and no point. What few (very few) decent scenes there are get lost among all the men crying, men hugging, men dancing, men hugging, men kissing, men crying some more.  Hardened soldiers seem to burst into uncontrollable tears without warning and without good reason all through the film. This was an uncomfortable procession of whirling, sashaying, blubbering men.  (Unless you count the even more awkward scene where blonde and irish-sounding Alexander actually has a love scene with a woman, his wife, and they spend most of it facing off on all fours growling at each other in the style of the Cowardly Lion.) If you're specifically looking for a gay-entertainment film, go for it; if you're looking for a historical fiction film, save yourself the torment and disappointment; this film wasn't even good for a laugh.

2310125,4,B0009PLLN6,"Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned Alexander and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD. Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another (or, as in my case, a first) look at what the grumbling is all about.

Alexander is a big film about a big person who did big things. How a story so altered by time, history, myth, and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues. And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the 'civilized world' of Alexander's time. Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined. Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together: each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life, the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe.

The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea, Oedipus, Herakles, Zeus, etc. If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambiance, this would have been a powerful work. But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia, India, Greece, etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and hearkens back to the Cecil B. DeMille view of ancient history, garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences.

Where this film (at least this version) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion. Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this 'director's cut'. A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad.

As for the cast, Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander, and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well. Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias, Val Kilmer's Philip, grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup, is suitably evil, but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and Roxane (Rosario Dawson) the rest of the cast is forgettable.

But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch, plug in to Oliver Stone's concept, and the air will clear. I, for one, think it is a film worth watching! Grady Harp, April 12",1335052800,3,3039,4.825335892514396

With all the flashbacks it was difficult to follow what was going on at certain times.

2310127,3,B0009PLLN6,"I love films based on history and historical characters. I've seen this one time and time again and I still have the same mixed feelings as the very first time when I saw it on screen.

Part of my problems have to do with Colin Farrell who either was miscast as Alexander or was required to play a ""human"" version of Alexander and comes out like a bit of a whimp, at least at times. Now if there is one thing that Alexander could NOT afford to be, it is precisely that, especially among his fellow-Macedonians. A Macedonian king did not live for very long if he wasn't tough, strong and ruthless. Philip was and so was Alexander, although this is not shown by Colin Farrell who, when he gets angry, seems to become more hysterical than anything else. This, in my view, was much more of a problem than deciding whether Farrell's Irish accent was ""acceptable"" or not. Anyway, they are all speaking English, not Ancient Greek or Macedonian!

A related problem is the way the relationship with Hephastion is treated. No problem with the relationship per se: it certainly has to be treated because it was crucial in Alaxander's existence. I did however have a bit of problem with the way it was treated, with Hephastion ""doe eyes"" at Alexander and with the two ""boys"" falling into each other's arms and crying on each other's shoulders at the slightest provocation. Since they were both athletes, both fully mature and both seasoned killers (as all of the Macedonians were), this did not sound very realistic.

On the other hand, most of the other actors (Val Kilmer as Philip, Angelina Jolie as Olympias, Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy, in particular) are good or even excellent, and so are the actors playing a number of the secondary characters such as Parmenion or Philotas. The costumes are meticulously researched and superb. The battles scenes, and Gaugamela in particular, are quite fantastic. It is however both strange and a pity that we only get treated to the two last ones - Gaugamela and Hydaspes. How about Granicus and Issos? And how about Cheronea, with Philip against Athens and Thebes? And how about all the sieges, in particular that of Tyre which lasted 7 months and was so difficult? Rather than the story of Alaxander's great deeds and those of his Macedonians, we only get a selection with many events being entirely passed over and some inacuracies introduced. For instance, Kleitos saved Alexander's life by cutting of a Persian's arm at Granicus, not at Gaugamela. Kleitos was the commander of Alexander's Royal squadrom (the king's horseguard, in effect) until he was murdered by Alexander, and he had this command already under Philip.

In the film, Oliver Stone also skirts and dances around two issues which had been raised: -- First, did Alexander have a hand in his father death? He does not say so, although he seems to suspect something, given his behavior, and Stone seems to have blamed the conspiracy Olympias only. Historians and novellists have picked different interpretations, depending on how they view Alexander and we will probably nver know for sure
- Second, was Alexander poisoned? Oliver Stone does not believe this was the case although the boss was clearly getting more erratic and murderous so that they could have been incentives to do away with him as a preventive measure.

So, the treatment of Alexander is largely the modern view adopted by historians: an emphasis on the man rather than the conqueror or the legend. The problem is that, when it comes down to the execution, the ""human touch"" seems overplayed and Colin Farrell made a very poor and unconvincing Alexander in my view...

Anyway, I loved that film, but largely because of Colin Farrell's performance and because it only tells part of the story with huge chunks left out, I can only give it three stars...",1333411200,4,3817,4.810975609756097
2310128,2,B0009PLLN6,"I'm a history major and I found this movie to be kind of on the boring side. I liked that the director stayed true to history about many things, but then again many things were not accurate like for example Alexander did not have blond hair...and its most likely he did more than hug his gay lover...

The battle scene against the Persians was historically accurate but it was too drawn out just like alot of other stuff. He could have made it more entertaining while staying historically accurate.
I've seen plenty of good historical movies and tv shows that stay accurate to history and are also entertaining...its just the way they are written that makes or breaks it, and unfortunately Oliver stone missed the mark here.

The director tried to explain why Alexander was troubled by showing how his parents influences created contradictions within  himself and how he got more paranoid over the course of the story...I just think Oliver Stone got lost in way too many details...and skipped over many battle scenes.

I thought the battle in India was kind of cool. I just didn't like how Oliver stone kept skipping into the past for very long periods of time and then coming back into the present again. I'm not a fan of that style of story telling...just a personal preference imo.

the movie could have been alot better. I think the downfall of the movie was that Oliver Stone was trying to please too many different types of people...he was trying to please the historians, was trying to please the average movie goer, was trying to please the gay community, was trying to please the anti-gay community by not showing gay sex....in the end no one was happy.",1332115200,3,1662,4.697594501718213

One, three of its actors, namely Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie. Without their skills of expressing wide-ranges of subtle and profound emotions, the dialogue would have come across as being flat.

Two, the large scale battle scenes and sets are very elaborate, breath-taking and do not overwhelm the viewer.

And three, the costumes also are well above standard from what I expected.

However, the storyline leaves a lot to be desired, felt more like fiction than any historical record, and can be summed up easily in one sentence...

The idea of exploring the east, instilled in Alexander as just a boy, his dream of uniting the world, with an aged Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins) relating it back to a scribe, Phillip teaching him that a king is made by suffering, not born.  Outstanding!  I could never forget the scene in the cave where Phillip is initiating him into the world of men.  I wasn't crazy about watching the repeated hints at the gayness of Alexander, but that also was true to history probably.  And then the first battle sequence was one of the best I have ever seen.

betrifft: Alexander - Revisited, Director's (Final Cut), DVD, deutsche Auflage

na, herzlichen Dank, (keine Rezension mehr zur deutschen DVD Auflage mglich)

Am 15.06.06 uerte ich mich  - relativ kurz - zur ""Alexander"" Einzel - DVD.

Zugegeben, der Film war (nicht nur mir, sondern eben vielen), so, - in der Form, wie er allein damals zu bekommen war, halt gekrzt, nicht mehr Kommentar wert.

Nun, wollte ich aber auf die viel lngere Fassung eingehen, und ... kann es nicht. A*** hat, ""genial"", wie sie nun mal sind, aus verkaufsstrategischen Grnden diese alte Rezension von damals zur Single Disc von mir nun dort stehen.

Ich habe also - angeblich - schon lngst was zur Revisited - Fassung getippt ! (nach deren Logik), kann also hchstens noch meine alte ndern ... was ich nun werde.

Mu das nun auch revidieren, denn, inzwischen halte ich diesen Film fr ein zu Unrecht gescholtenes, kleines ""Meisterwerk"".

Nicht nur, das die Director's Cut - Version im Unterschied zur alten Kinofassung viel lnger ist [Laufzeit, gesamt, des Films, nun: 204, 50 Min. - davor waren es gerade mal 168,11 Min. (dh. 160, 42 - ohne den Abspann) ... durch die ganzen, neuen Umschnitte und das einfgen neuer Szenen ergibt dieser Film hier nmlich, nun endlich ein richtig gutes Gesamtwerk.

Ich wnschte, ich knnte anderen bzw. mir selbst berhaupt richtig erklren, was nun genau mich damals schon an der alten Kinofassung so gefesselt hat, das ich ihn mir zwar nie kaufte, trotzdem nicht mehr ganz aus dem Kopf bekam.

Nach durchsehen des sehr hilfreichen Schnittberichtes dann, entschloss ich mich einfach kurzerhand, ihn mir spter in dieser vorliegenden Form doch zu kaufen.

So sah damals meine alte Rezension dazu aus:
nicht jeder Regisseur hat ""goldene Hnde""... Fakt ist: Wo Ridley Scott (der ja sonst auch fter's ganz andere Themen verfilmt) mit ""Gladiator"" weit weniger Schwierigkeiten hatte, - ist bei Olive Stone hier unzweifelhaft festzustellen, das er sich wohl doch besser weiterhin mit ""Anti"" - Kriegfilmen (""Platoon"") oder seinen Politdramen (""JFK - Tatort Dallas"", ""Nixon"") htte beschftigen sollen, - da dort wahrscheinlich doch viel eher sein wahres Talent zu finden ist !?

""Alexander"" ist zwar rein handwerklich durchaus nicht schlecht gemacht, auch an den Leistungen der hochkartigen Schauspieler Collin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer usw., ist nichts ernsthaftes auszusetzen (mit Sicherheit um Lngen besser als frhere Verfilmungen dieses heiklen Thema's), - eine wirklich mitreissende ""Stimmung"" kommt im Vergleich zu anderen History Streifen dabei aber trotzdem irgendwie nicht so richtig auf.

Sehr unglcklich gewhlt war hier auch der Versuch, mit sogenannten ""unterstreichenden"" Effekten a la ""Three Kings"" oder absichtlich das Bild verfremdenten Farbfiltern, wie es z. B. bei ""der Soldat James Ryan"" gemacht wurde (Gelb - bzw. - Rotstich Farbschleiern fr besondere epische Schlachtszenen u.a.) eine gewisse dramaturgische Wirkung zu erzielen.

Zur Verteidigung des Films muss aber auch gesagt werden, das sich, was oft bei anderen nicht immer der Fall ist, so gut es mglich war, ziemlich exakt an die historisch bekannten Fakten gehalten (""Knigreich der Himmel"" ist ebenfalls eines der besseren Beispiele dafr) wurde.

Durch die eigentlich berflssigen Diskussionen im Vorfeld um Alexanders moralische Neigungen o.. hatte dieser Film (wie auch z. B. ""die Passion Christi"") sowieso einen schweren Start gehabt und es fiel somit schwer, bertriebene Erwartungen zu erfllen.

Fazit: Nicht nur fr Geschichtsfans zu empfehlen, - wer grosszgig ber einige ""Patzer"" hinwegsehen kann, wird auch hier noch bestimmt gut unterhalten werden.

Nachtrag:
Auch wenn ich dem Film, mehr als zumindest die meiten hier, damals schon sehr versnlich gegenber geblieben bin, mu ich nun trotzdem zugeben ...

Ich habe dem Regisseur selbst und besonders seinem Film ein wenig unrecht getan.

Denn ""Alexander"" ist einfach dermaen, von vorne herein durch die Kritik zerissen worden (und als quasi ""Todessto"" fr ihn kommen jetzt erst recht noch die Schnitte von frher hier dazu), da er kaum eine Chance hatte, jemanden auf Anhieb richtig zu berzeugen.

Sogar die deutsche Synchronisation ist stimmig, lesen sie es selbst nach (Wikipedia). Im englischen Original hat Collin Farrell einen irischen, - Angelina Jolie dafr einen russischen Akzent. Das ist zwar auch weniger ein Punkt zur Kritik, denn, in der Originalfassung versuchte Oliver Stone damit nmlich auch, die unterschiedlichen Kulturen durch unterschiedliche Dialekte darzustellen. Trotzdem bin ich der Meinung, - hat man als Zuschauer im Kopf, das alle Griechen bzw. Makedonier darstellen sollen, verwirrt einen sowas reichlich. Also ist es sogar besser, wenn rein deutsch bersetzt wird.

Auch, ist es mir im Grunde ehrlich gesagt ziemlich egal (gewesen), - dh. nicht nur jetzt, im nachhinein, sondern eigentlich schon damals, als dieser Film das erste mal erschien, ob Alexander der Groe nun homosexuell oder zumindest, das, was wir heute als bisexuell bezeichnen wrden (denn er hatte ja einige Geliebte, also Frauen und er zeugte hier auch mit hchster Wahrscheinlichkeit seinen Sohn selbst) war.

Man darf nicht vergessen, das sowas damals im alten Griechenland durchaus blich, ja, sogar erwnscht war. Es ist eben ein groer Denkfehler (soll heien, ich selbst schliee mich hier garnicht mal aus !), der Leute, alles mit den heutigen Wertvorstellungen bzw. solchen ""Augen"" kritisch zu betrachten.

Und zur Faktentreue bzw. historischen (Un)Genauigkeit, - zitiere ich nun einfach mal einen Auszug aus dem Netz, kopiere hier einige Beispiele fr Fehler bzw. nderungen, die so natrlich - bewieenermaen falsch - im Film spter vorkommen:

1. Aristoteles zeigt anhand eines Fubodenmosaiks seinen Schlern die damals bekannte Welt. Dieses Mosaik jedoch enthlt die lateinische, nicht die griechische Schrift. Auch Ptolemaios I. zeigt eine Landkarte, die lateinische Begriffe enthlt. In beiden Fllen wre aufgrund der ansonsten bereits recht wirklichkeitsgetreuen Darstellung der Landkarten beziehungsweise aufgrund der Dialoge der Mittelmeerraum und der Nahe Osten auch trotz einer schriftlichen Sprachbarriere erkennbar gewesen. Zu Zeiten Alexanders war die lateinische Sprache und Schrift in den stlichen Mittelmeergebieten nicht verbreitet und konnte sich dann selbst in der rmischen Kaiserzeit nur als Amtssprache, nicht aber als Intellektuellensprache durchsetzen. Ebenso sind jegliche Inschriften und lesbare Briefe, trotz keilschriftartiger Buchstaben, im Film auf Englisch gehalten, obwohl deren Verstndnis nicht wichtig fr die Handlung ist.

2. Aus Grnden der filmischen Dramaturgie wurden Ereignisse an einen anderen Ort verlegt beziehungsweise an einen anderen Zeitpunkt. So wurde Alexander der Groe nicht in der Schlacht am Hydaspes durch einen Pfeil schwer verwundet, sondern bei der Belagerung von Multan, als er sich angeblich alleine dem gesamten feindlichen Heer stellte, bis ihm seine Truppen zu Hilfe eilten. Im Anschluss dieser Verletzung fasst Alexander im Film selbst den Beschluss zur Umkehr, nach der antiken berlieferung kam es hingegen nach der Schlacht am Hydaspes zu einer Meuterei, weshalb er zur Umkehr gezwungen war. Anders als sein historisches Vorbild ist Stones Alexander daher weitgehend frei von Hybris und Grenwahn.

3. Besonders fr Kindheit und Privatleben Alexanders sttzt sich das Drehbuch offensichtlich nicht auf den allgemein recht zuverlssigen Geschichtsschreiber Arrian, sondern auf die von Legenden und Anekdoten durchsetzte Alexanderbiographie des Philosophen Plutarch. So findet sich im Film vieles, was zwar in einer antiken Quelle so oder hnlich berichtet wird, was aber von den meisten Wissenschaftlern lngst als Fiktion enttarnt worden ist. Alles in allem entspricht der Film eher dem Forschungsstand der 1960er Jahre als dem seiner Entstehungszeit.

Fazit (nun zum 2. und diemal anschlieenden male), ich kann den Film jedem, in der nun verlngerten Form, so nur wrmstens empfehlen, - es ist ein Film (!), kein Geschichtsbuch. Wer sich ber das echte Leben Alexander's richtig informieren mchte, mu sich halt auch die Mhe machen, darber zu lesen.

Und fr solche (jngere Jahrgnge) Menschen, die immer noch glauben, ""der Soldat James Ryan"" z. B. zeigt - verglichen jetzt mal hierzu - dagegen auch nur halbwegs glaubwrdige Geschichte, sei noch angemerkt: durch die Umschnitte, kommt die historische Schlacht Alexander's gegen Dareios III., also gegen das persische Groreich, stattgefunden am 1. Oktober im Jahre 331 vor Christus, bei Gaugamela nun auch viel frher hier im Film vor.

Nicht so schn ist, das es kaum weitere, erwhnenswerte Extra's auf dieser Revisited Fassung - DVD gibt, und, das ganze auch nicht besonders aufgemacht wurde. Sie erhalten beim Kauf lediglich ein einfaches Amary Case. Hier htte schon etwas der Neuauflage angemessenes ""drin"" sein drfen.",1328832000,2,9069,5.593727206418673
2310135,4,B0009PLLN6,"The third time proves to be the charm for Oliver Stone's ""Alexander."" First released in 2004, the movie was a major flop and generally scorned by viewers and critics alike. After offering the Director's Cut on DVD, Stone returned to the movie to offer this final version that plays for three and a half hours. Besides additional footage, Stone changes the narrative structure, relying more on flashbacks to tell the story.

This ""Final Cut"" certainly is better than the first two versions of the film. Colin Farrell does a fine job in the lead role and there are some excellent, if gory, battle scenes. Rosario Dawson's role as Alexander's wife Roxana is expanded. Stone includes more on Alexander's turbulent relationship with his closest generals and his romantic relationships with two other men. The score by Vangelis is excellent. A number of actors--Brian Blessed, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Plummer--make appearances that are a little too brief.

Still, there are flaws. Stone is less than subtle about trying to show how his conflicting parents shaped Alexander. Val Kilmer's take on Philip of Macedon needed a bit more time on the screen to really be fleshed out. Angelina Jolie hams it up as Alexander's mother Olympia. Besides lacking subtlety in the role, the accent Jolie uses it so horrible that it undermines her performance. Considering this is the third cut, Stone could have added special features. The only one is Stone offering his thoughts on why this ""Final Cut"" was needed, the artistic freedom it presented him and a charming comparison to the epics of the 50s and 60s that he loved so much.

At times I felt like I was watching a very, very long History Channel documentary and yet I have to say that I didn't find the film to be as bad as many other reviewers here apparently do.  I do agree with those who say that a lot of Alexander's important exploits are not showcased but instead are glossed over through Ptolemy's narratives but in fairness to Stone it would probably take 3 four-hour long movies to portray them all and at least the incredible defeat of Darius using the brilliant technique that is still taught in most military schools is shown here with at least for me irritating subtitles which only makes it feel even more like a History Channel documentary but overall I feel that once you get used to Stone's style of storytelling which is unlike most similar epics that we have seen from other directors like Kubrick, Scott or Lean this film while not perfect is still very good and engaging.  I found myself forced to concentrate and to pay attention throughout to catch the flow given the frequent flashbacks and jumping around and as such I didn't really feel the length of the film having so immersed myself in it.

Story aside at least the picture and sound qualities were very good and although the special feature documentaries aren't that entertaining at least we finally get Alexander in the form that Stone was best able to deliver.  In trying to show the human side and to explain what makes him tick, Stone has succeeded in emphasising that aspect albeit having to sacrifice the more exciting fighting scenes.

Not for everyone but it's probably the best that Stone could have done.",1327104000,,1925,4.614035087719298
2310138,1,B0009PLLN6,"Colin Farrell is ludicrously miscast, with black eyebrows and blond ill-fitting fright-wig, so that it's just very hard to look at him at any point during this painfully long film. None of the other ""Macedonian warriors"" look so absurd. Why? I'll just leave it there. In the battle-scenes with stirring music he's still badly choreographed and too short compared to the extras. QUO VADIS way back when in B&W with Peter Ustinov as Nero was better for decadence at court. This is just a very very bad film.

An infinitely more nuanced, indeed fascinating portrait of this time is the recent book DIVIDING THE SPOILS, by British historian Robin Waterfield, which deals with what happened to the vast territories conquered by Alexander in the years immediately following his death.

Oliver Stone no doubt remains a very rich man despite wasting many millions on this film. Too bad. Maybe if he was hungry he might recapture whatever talent he originally displayed. Doubtful though, by this point.",1325894400,4,993,5.012121212121212
2310139,5,B0009PLLN6,"ONE TO ALWAYS HAVE AVAILABLE FOR A MOVIE NIGHT.
I honestly want to give this film 4/5. However ive given it a 5 as consolidation for the hugely unjust negative reviews from the extremely anal ""film critics"" who have blasted this great film, im just a normal guy giving a normal guys opinion.
This film honestly deserves more praise than it got, an ambitious project.
The film did one spectacular thing, this was to as accurately and as best a film could in portraying and emphasizing how much of a LION of a man Alexander the Great was.

I clearly understand where people come from when they type up a negative review of the film. I mean, it dosent portray battles such as Granicus, Issues and the siege of Tyre. Furthermore the film pretty much just summarises Alexanders conquest.
However to be fair, there is not a movie bugdet large enough, to accurately and effectively allow a single film to include every single important battle and event in Alexander's life. It is unrealistic for a film to include not only all of his conquest of Persia, but also greece, central asia and india There is just too much for a single movie t include, and so the current film does its very best to explain to someone who Alexander was and the challenges he faced.

One of the main reasons 'Alexander' was hit with a few negative reviews was the films clear portrayal (an accurate one if i may add) of Alexander's bisexuality. But if there is one thing i can say, that is that im sorry but its true. It dosent matter if you felt like it offended you of your views but the fact of the matter is that Alexander was in fact bisexual, as was quite common then. And so i praise the film for its accurate portayal.

The acting in the film was very convincing. Colin Farrel for one demonstrated so much character and ambition and really gave it his all, and that really came across during scenes in which Alexander found himself in moments of intense stress. Val Kilmer did an excellent job in portraying Phillip as the drunkered, the leader and the father that Phillip really was. Angelina Jolie also did well as Queen Olympia, many were confused with the accent she used, one which sounded eastern european, however this can be easily explained as Olympia was from Epirus which lies in modern day Albania and their accents where known at that time to have a twist to them.
A big high five should be given to Jared Leno who portrayed Hephaestion, Alexander's long time friend and lover, i haven't seen such emotion shown in any acting role as i did from him during that role.

This film is a great achievement and as i said in the title, a brave attempt at telling Alexander's larger than life story.
An instant classic in my mind.",1325721600,3,2712,4.517311608961304
2310140,4,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander Revisited is difficult to review... I am giving it 4 stars because the production is outstanding, definitely a new standard for the movie industry. This movie had the potential to become one of the greatest movies of all time. However, the acting is really horrible... Colin Farrell is constantly overacting and he is very far from making a good characterization of an Emperor of those times. Definitely, it doesn't depict how a man like Alexander could possibly behave. The same apply to the rest of the casting, including Angelina Jolie; they talk and behave like if they were acting in a TV drama series... the way they are acting is very distant of how the nobility behave. I can't understand why Oliver Stone did it in that way. Still, Alexander is the kind of movie one should not miss.",1325462400,,802,4.735714285714286

Since it was not rated, I should have been more alert as to the probable content. Casting Brad Pitt as Alexander and Anjelica Jolie as HIS MOTHER was certainly a stretch, although if he was born when she was 12-15 years old, the age difference probably wasn't that important. I doubt I would ever watch this movie again and found it a waste of over three hours. Amazon's price caught my eye and influenced my decision to buy. I have a hard time passing up a bargain. In addition, it was rated as far superior to the earlier Alexander the Great, which I also purchased for a comparison. I still have not watched this earlier version.",1324425600,3,763,4.610294117647059
2310142,5,B0009PLLN6,"It is too many years since I last read a detailed biography of Alexander for knowledge of the reality (as best we can know it) to have anything to do with my enjoyment of the film. In most cases, it takes pretty much the standard epic biography line, with the addition of the bi-sexuality that C.B. DeMille would never have been permitted to show, much as he would have liked to do so, if it were possible under Hayes Office rules. The Oedipal situation is also given more overt presence than would have passed the censors in the heyday of Biblical (and other historical) epics. On the positive side, the battle scenes were well done cinematically, with the use of elephants being particularly striking. (I believe the disciplined formations of elephants shown in the film is historically inaccurate, the elephant proving to have too unruly in combat to be an effective weapon). I have no complaint about historical inaccuracies when it comes to entertainment vehicles.
While the director makes a good faith effort to account for the driving ambition in a man seeking to conquer the known universe (as  portrayed in the film) I could not help but feel that the motivations of so complex a many are nearly impossible to capture in a period more than a millennium past. However, the director does a good job of delineating a motivational base adequate to the needs of the film.
Most of the actors filled their roles adequately, historical drama being a notorious burial ground for even the best of actors. The lead showed too little charisma, no personal fault involved,  this being a mostccomplicated man he had to play. Mostly, when an actor failed, it appeared to have been a consequence of the script.
So, over-all I did not find this to be a particularly exciting film, but it was interesting. Hopefully, both I and other readers, will be stimulated to learn more about this towering historical figure.",1323216000,,1905,4.804878048780488

Stone's direction is crisp as always. Vangelis soundtrack, in my opinion, is one of the best ever(have it on my iPhone). Colin Farrel is the perfect, complicated Alexander. And you gotta love Christopher Plummer as Aristotle.

Another wonderful film from director Oliver Stone (JFK,NATURAL BORN KILLERS,WORLD TRADE CENTER)that is completely misunderstood and lambasted by the ""critics"". The critics by the way are the ones who are paid hansomely for their reviews, don't have to wait in line for a ticket in the cold weather, have to deal with parking issues,and see the film at their convenience with no other audience members. It seems to me that the critics have gone after Stone ever since he accused the goverment of complicity in the murder of John F. Kennedy. And now they come after him for ALEXANDER which in my opinion is one of the best, most ambitious, historically accurate, visually dazziling, expertly directed, and wonderfully written films of the 21st century. Alexander is a marvelous film filled with great acting, wonderful build ups of increasing paranoia, riffe with conspiracy, betrayal, family bonds, two extraordinary and sprawling battle scenes and scenary that is a wonder to behold. You walk away from the film having a different (or new) view & respect for Alexander the Great, you may even learn a few things. For those of you unfamiliar with the story of Alexander, you will walk away having learned a lot. It's a rich and beautiful film, yet the critics want to go after it because they don't like Colin Farrell""s(PHONE BOOTH, THE NEW WORLD, FRIGHT NIGHT)hair. They don't approve of Val Kilmer's(THE DOORS, BATMAN FOREVER, TOMBSTONE) one eye. Or they don't like Angelina Jolie's (GIRL INTERRUPTED, SALT, THE TOURIST)Romanian accent. How can they dismiss the film based on that? How can they say it was boring and compare it to TROY? First of all,there is NO comparison between ALEXANDER & TROY. Second, this film is anything but boring. If you want mindless ""action"", no historical foundation and a lot of CGI B.S., then watch TROY.

I love the acting, narration, and story. I knew nothing about Alexander before this film. Critics complain because it leaves out pieces of history and events. But my question is, how a movie so big and epic like this, can a director Fit every single piece of historical documentation without it being intensely boring or long? This movie made me want to do deeper research into the man. I feel bad for future movie go-ers. The current day movies don't stand up to this.

2310151,2,B0009PLLN6,"I'm one of those strange people who thinks that history is interesting, and that the actual stories of people like Alexander The Great would be good movies. Unfortunately, Hollywood, and in this case Oliver Stone, see things differently. This film is a good example of this problem; it ought to be a great story, and one would expect that given the amount of money spent to make it, and the exciting subject matter involved, that it would be. After all, Alexander was one of those rare individuals who actually did change the course of history. Let's see where it all went so wrong here.

First, you have to understand that Alexander was an incredibly complex man, a military genius at both the strategic and tactical levels, and also a serious megalomaniac nutjob. He was going up against the most powerful empire of his day; with hindsight a lot of historians like to say that the Persians were slouches, unable to fight effectively against the Greeks, etc., but history shows us that this was simply not true; prior to Alexander the Greek efforts against the Persians had been at best only intermittently successful, and, as in the Athenian expedition against Egypt between 460-454 BC, when the Persians absolutely annihilated sizable chunks of both the Athenian army and navy, frequently disastrous failures. The Greek phalanx had a decided advantage over Persian infantry units, but this had never proved enough.

It was Alexander who changed all this. Unfortunately, Stone's script cares little about how the Macedonian first subjugated Greece (which rebelled against him immediately when he took the throne) and then conquered Persia. It pays almost no attention the the Persian king Darius III, a very competent opponent who put up serious resistance to the Macedonian invasion, and no real attention to Memnon of Rhodes, one of Darius' generals whose premature death probably saved Alexander's campaign. All of these exciting things would make for a great movie, surely, but instead we get what seem like unending hours of Angelina Jolie playing with snakes.

Another crippling problem with this movie lies in the casting. The fact is that Alexander had incredible charisma; even when his men had decided (with good reason) that he had gone crazy, they followed him all the way to India. There are very few actors in the world who could carry off such a role, and I'm sorry to say that Colin Farrell isn't even close to being one of them. And when the star of your biopic isn't up to the task, you've got real trouble.

Then there are the scenes that are just plain stupid. I had a good laugh when Alexander on his horse faces the rearing elephant, but most of the time I was just praying that the film would end. Why did I stick it out? Well, I was with friends, and we had all agreed that we would watch the whole thing so we could say we had. Foolish, I know.

So why two stars? Well, the film is visually impressive, technically well-made, and Stone does use his CGI effectively (unlike the disastrous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a>). The scenes of Babylon are quite impressive, and since it was the fall of Babylon to the original Alexander that spelled the real end of the Persian Empire, this was nice to see. But unless you like to laugh at bad films (as I confess I do sometimes), give this mess of a movie a miss.",1308614400,2,3469,4.974137931034483

While it may have been historically accurate and even though I'm not a prude as I was a prison guard for 25yrs. the sexual immorality as Stone depicted in the movie which he portrayed to be Alexander's heart throbs, was disgusting.  In addition, to see Colin Farrell galavanting around looking for his next love affair in a blond wig was also very disappointing.

2310153,5,B0009PLLN6,"As a fan of classic epic films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, El Cid, and The Ten Commandments, as well as modern epics such as The Right Stuff, Ghandi, and Braveheart, I can tell you that this film belongs among them. Epic filmmaking--that is, films that go on for 3 hours plus and tell grand, sweeping tales of colossal figures in adventurous times--requires that things be done differently from more earthbound movies, and so are to be judged with a wider scope. From beginning to end the cinematography must capture the vastness and beauty of the hero's world, in breathtaking and flawless fashion. The battle scenes must be superbly choreographed, scaled, and amassed. The music must be dramatic, sweeping, and evocative. The panoply of main characters must be in sufficient number to weave an interesting dramatic web whose threads take time to satisfactorily unravel. The overall cast must number in the thousands. The sets and costumes must be luxuriously, ornately, and authentically magnificent. The main character must be--and be rendered--riveting to watch through charismatic, if not gifted, acting. The dialogue must dramatically evoke epic times while still sounding useful. And the directing must be skilled enough to combine all of these elements in such a way that the audience is taken on the same journey the main character takes, thereby becoming utterly transported into that character's mind and world.

If you think about it, Mr. Stone had a Herculean Labor here: To bring Alexander ""The Great"" down from the ivory pedestal he's resided upon in bust for 2300 years, into our modern times so that we might try to understand him as ""The Man"" inside four hours. No other figure in human history has been so guilded by legend, or obscured by such legendary true accomplishments. How does one begin to get a sense of this man--his thoughts, feelings, vulnerabilities, that secret inner life? Yes, we know what he DID. But who WAS he?

This film delivers on all that.

So kindly overlook the at-times overmatched acting by Colin Farrell and his youthful peers. Turn a blind eye toward the gross miscasting of Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, Phillip II. Cover your ears as Angelina Jolie snarls and claws her way through one overbearing scene after another, even as she looks every inch Alexander's mother Olympias. Bear with Alexander's old general Ptolemy, ably played as usual by Sir Anthony Hopkins, as he meanders through his own ruminations about who Alexander was in the course of narration. Lie back on the couch and breathe as Oliver Stone beats the Oedipal horse into pudding.

The truth is, even those numerous flaws fail to detract from the impact of this film: To put you down on the earth as it was in Alexander's day, and experience what it might have been like to be him--in battle, in love, in friendship, in tragedy, conquering most of the known world. By the end, you will feel as if you've really KNOWN the man. That's what epic filmmaking is all about.

And if it took Olie three tries to get it right, so what? What matters is that he got it RIGHT. And we get to enjoy it.

(P.S.: The packaging and overall production quality are superb. Really beautiful. That it's selling for about five bucks is itself a wonder of the world.)",1304553600,4,3275,4.860215053763441
2310154,2,B0009PLLN6,"My first criticism in this review is leveled at Amazon.com. With three ""cuts"" of this movie, obviously Oliver Stone felt a real need to differentiate these films from one another, ""improving"" them until he was satisfied.  Why then, when we look up each of these cuts on Amazon, is the same Amazon review given (the Revisited review)?  I would like to have had their professional take on each edition, and some details on how & why number two is different from number one, not just how the last is different from its two previous renditions. The information would be very helpful in deciding if I should give the other versions I have not seen, a viewing.  Also, why has Amazon combined all of the public's reviews into all three editions.  For the vast majority of reviews it's impossible to tell which edition they are reviewing.  Not very helpful at all!!!

As far as the movie goes (I saw the second one, the Director's cut) I can understand why this movie got mixed reviews and ended up well below the hoped for high marks.  The movie comes across confused, starting out with narration, is almost documentary-like in places, jumps into much needed story content, often detours back in time unchronologically, then attempts to figure out how all this fits together to form one big cohesive picture.  Which it hardly does.  The movie rather fails to come across as epic, it mostly feels just long.  Not that there weren't some successful aspects.  I enjoy most of the acting by the lead performers.  It was good to see Val Kilmer back in a substantial role after being in so many ""B"" movies.  Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing as usual.  And Colin Farrell demonstrates his capabilities in portraying emotional content with ease and credibility.  And there are a number of well-renowned actors in minor roles, though their contribution fails to help this disjointed story.  I liked some of the cinematography very much.  The portrayal of Babylon was intriguing.

With THREE versions of this movie available, we have a clear clue that something has been amiss with this movie from the beginning, and with the incredible time commitment of this film it's going to be a long time before I'll watch the other versions to see how they are different, or, more importantly, if the story gets any better.",1301097600,,2293,4.791348600508906
2310155,4,B0009PLLN6,"Okay, I saw the theatrical release and I bought the director's cut.  Both were entertaining and visually stunning but disappointing.  Alexander was such a complex character and accomplished so much in such a short life, and the film just didn't capture that adequately.  A montage of his conquests in Phoenecia, Syria, and Egypt might, for example, have dramatized the extent of his accomplishments before Gaugamela. Also, the question of whether he truly thought of himself as divine after his visit to Siwah in Egypt might have provided a pivotal moment.  The ""Final Cut"" is much better than its predecessor versions - clearer and, at the same time, more nuanced.  I actually liked it very much. Not sure I would have felt so positive about it if the earlier versions hadn't been disappointing.",1300233600,3,796,5.0
2310156,2,B0009PLLN6,"I missed the earlier versions of this film in the cinema, and rented this ""revisited"" version as a prelude to perhaps purchasing it.  I'm deeply grateful I approached it with caution.  The reason epic historical films (often, but not always) worked better in the ""old days"" is that they were largely cast with seasoned English actors who had some Shakespeare on their resumes, or at least some real stage training and voice classes.  Even in 1963's ""Cleopatra,"" for example, Rex Harrison runs away with the entire film because he has easily the best training in the cast (that's including Richard Burton).

Here you have Colin Farrell trying to carry this monumental mess with two assets:  he's capable of honest emotional work, which has served him well in less demanding roles, and he's easy on the eyes, which is an obsession of Hollywood studios, and to a fault.  Alexander did not conquer a large portion of the ancient world with his pretty face, and no actor on the planet can carry a biopic of Alexander merely with a cute tush and honest, sensitive eyes.  Colin Farrell dropped out of acting school as a young man, and apparently before he got anywhere near a decent voice class.  He shouts hoarsely through most of this 3.5+ hour film, his weak little voice burnt out like a cheerleader's, pausing desperately every 5 or 6 words like William Shatner used to when he was especially bored with a bad Star Trek script.  Worse, Colin's been around Hollywood so long he's picked up a lot of Southern California sound changes, so he speaks like a vapid Irish surfer dude.

There is a wild tangle of actor dialects in this film, ranging from Scot to English to Irish to Italian to Persian.  One can understand this and almost forgive it with an international cast.  But why then is Angelina Jolie the only one attempting (and for no reason) a Greek accent that in fact comes out vaguely Bulgarian?  (And why is her entire performance about her pouty lips and pretty eyes?  She's usually better than this.)  Why did Val Kilmer decide to make just a few Irish sound changes while chewing the scenery as Alexander's monstrous father Phillip?  Did he feel that sorry for Colin Farrell, and assumed everyone else had gotten the memo?  Why couldn't someone have coached the pretty young actor playing Bogoas to pronounce the title of the film correctly?  (I kid you not:  his character has followed Alexander halfway across Asia for years, and near the end of the film says ""You have made me so happy, Ales-kander.""  *Sigh*)  All of the young men in this film are pretty, gym-pumped, earnest, and can barely articulate their lines.  (Elliot Cowan as young Ptolemy fares better.)  Hardly any of them can get through a single line on one breath; they all rasp out 5 or six words, take a Shatner pause, and then finish with effort--it becomes the film's fetish, and it's torture to listen to and watch (like the two monumentally dull and brutal battle scenes).  This weakness of delivery is heightened when the film is sprinkled with tiny performances by older actors with actual stage training, such as the great Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer, John Kavanagh, and especially Anthony Hopkins who takes the thankless task of narrating this glop and manages to dance on everyone's inarticulate grave, most notably in his heartfelt summation at the end.  I do appreciate Oliver Stone's refusal to avoid or demonize Alexander's bisexuality--he must have had screaming matches with the terrified studio execs on that one, and for the most part he won out, thank goodness.  I just wish he'd been able to insist on an actor who could pull it all off.",1297641600,5,3641,4.7856
2310157,3,B0009PLLN6,"This review's title may describe why Oliver Stone thought it necessary to yet again recut his 2004 film, ""Alexander."" Despite the director's best efforts and intentions, it seems that no amount of tinkering will reclamate what remains a slow-paced historo-epic.

Horrendously spastic handheld cameras ruin battle scenes. The frequent dancing girl/orgy sequences are useful only if you need a restroom break or wish to buy a box of Milkduds.

Kilmer as one-eyed Philip of Macedon is unattractively porcine, Jolie's overinflated lips look ready to explode and Farrell is badly miscast as conqueror of the ancient world.

2310159,1,B0009PLLN6,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I toughed it out though - actually finished watching the entire thing. It is so sad that so much of it is laughable. Why do movies about ancient times ditch the normal rules of entertainment, and settle for a plot that rivals that of Chinatown - i.e. horribly dysfunctional families in which mothers kill off those who might compete with their chosen heirs. (And where did this formula - used in I, Claudius and HBO's Rome series - come from other than the land of TV itself?) Ancient histories focus on the battles and the warriors, their deeds and their challenges. We see none of that here.

Instead we get - no strategy sessions (Alexander's chief claim to fame), no Band of Brothers bonding time, gratuitous dancing scenes with sexy choreography (certainly not authentic, at least not as represented here), babes who really rule the roost (as opposed to the period politics of subservient wives), and kings who don't have food tasters (to protect against poisoning). Most of all we get no curses, no spells, and no real gods - no religion. And no conquered peoples. It's all very, very odd.

Watch it - but keep the pause button handy.

I am going to try to watch the film again with the historian Robin Lane Fox's commentary on, in the hopes of getting something of redeeming value out of this dismal, embarrassing, colosally bad film.

I am so sad. There have been so many wonderful Oliver Stone films. It's hard to see your heroes mess up.

I am a bit of a historical purist, so there was one major flaw for me the casting. In particular, the use of an Afro-Caribbean actress to portray an Iranian/Afghan character in Roxanna was flawed (along with idiotic accent). By all accounts the area Roxanne was from the people were fair skinned and had European features. Even the portrayal of the ""Indians"" was flawed, because the Indians of the Northwest (Indus Valley) that Alexander encountered were themselves invaders from the Black Sea area (Scythians) and were relatively fair skinned. Racially the people the Macedonians encountered looked very much like them. So the overtones of purity the Greeks keep going on about in the film was not so much to do with race (as we know it today) but more about the culture. Alexander's own mother encountered this. So for this reason, I give it a 4. Otherwise it would have been a great film.",1283126400,3,1089,4.731578947368421
2310166,4,B0009PLLN6,"Since its release Alexander has being subjected to an almost universal panning by the critics.
Total Film opens by claiming it may be ""the comedy of the year"".
Attitude called it dull. Hotdog (gone out of business now) seemed to think it was just O.K.
What I found the most intriguing of all of the reviews I read is that no-one has attacked the film on its historical accuracy, or lack thereof. Historically Alexander is a bit of a mess, for example it is strongly believed that both Alexander and Olympias were responsible for the assassination of King Phillip as had he lived Alexander would not have inherited the throne or possibly even survived The battle of Guagamela was in fact the third battle between Alexander and Darius, and all three were fought with rivers between the armies making Alexander's victories all the more impressive. Alexander was injured in India, but not in a jungle but in the walled city of Malli. This may seem like nit picking but in fact had we seen the real battles and strategies that were employed the moniker Alexander the great would seem much more fitting. This was a man who laid siege to the island fortress of Tyre and by building a causeway from the coast succeeded in taking it in a few months, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon lay siege to this same city for thirteen years and eventually gave up. For me these were where the film fell down. But even these details did not stop my enjoyment of the film.
This for me was a film not about a great warrior king who fought wars and conquered nations, it is a blood stained love song to Hephaestion his childhood friend and constant companion. I have heard constant criticism of Stone in that you never see this love consummated, I disagree,  throughout the film there are moments between these two men that are so intimate and loving as to transcend sex, in fact the sex act as portrayed in the film is unpleasant and violent, we see Phillip brutally sodomise a young man, Alexander virtually raping his wife and even a kiss between Alexander and a dancing youth is aggressive and angry, sex in this film is never loving and intimate, it is like the battles, obsessed with power. The relationship between the two men in the film is one of mutuality and devotion and I think this is really where a lot of the negative press springs from, I believe had there been a big sex scene between the men it would hardly have registered or we would have had reviews praising the bravery of  Farrell and Leto and all sorts of Oscar talk, however two men looking into each others eyes and talking of love is even more frightening and threatening than a quick shag and back to the killing.
For me Alexander is a flawed masterpiece, the score was by the numbers. And some of the dialogue was overblown and grandiose, but to call it dull or comedic is to miss the point.",1279584000,,2850,4.532038834951456

2310173,4,B0009PLLN6,"This is absurd. There are three versions of this film, and each should have a separate set of reviews. Come on, Amazon. Is it so difficult to do this? This is a review of the Blu-ray ""Alexander Revisited"".

The original cut of ""Alexander"" was controversial for a single reason... Oliver Stone refused to hide the fact that homosexual behavior was common among the Greeks (usually an older man with a younger). * It's okay to show people having their guts ripped out, but don't you dare show two intimate friends (Alexander and Hephaestion) pledging their life-long loyalty, or a man kissing a eunuch (Bagoas), then having sex with him. And although there are several stories about why Philip was murdered, Stone uses the one in which a young man, a member of his bodyguard and Philip's occasional lover, ** takes revenge when Philip fails to do anything about the young man's rape by other men.

There is also a scene in which the young Alexander is told by Aristotle that women aren't worth loving, and that sex between men -- if it is not simply out of lust, but for the purpose of character development -- is a worthy thing. That must have gotten a lot of viewers' whities tightened.

The real problems with ""Alexander"" stem from Stone's desire to present a drama, not just an historical epic. Though ancient writers reported Alexander's personality as a mixture of great ambition, high intelligence, and a sometimes uncontrollable rashness, Stone fails to present these in any coherent fashion. Alexander is portrayed as torn between love for Philip (who alternates between love and a refusal to acknowledge him as heir (whether because he believes the child a bastard, or he didn't want a half-Macedonian heir from Olympias, isn't clear)), and his mother, who's constantly pressing him to Do Great Things.

The biggest failing of the script, however, is providing a clear reason for Alexander's heavy drinking and ""seduction"" by Eastern culture. The result is that a film that's supposed to illuminate one of the most-important people in history leaves us with more questions than we started with.

An even bigger failing is Stone's disastrous casting of Colin Farrell -- who badly wanted to play the part -- as Alexander. Whatever one might think of Farrell's thespic skills, he is in totally over his head. (The blonde wig -- why is Alexander always portrayed as blonde? It looks stupid. -- doesn't help.)

There is no question about Alexander's charisma. (He would have /had/ to been charismatic to command the loyalty of so many men for so long, especially as he shaved his beard, a no-no among Greek males. ***) Farrell gets this very well. It's the subtle moments that don't come off.

Whenever he's disturbed or unhappy or confused, his face takes on the same sappy expression, shaking and twitching to no particular end, other than demonstrating that he can over-emote. The scenes in which he confronts his mother range from incompetent to embarrassing.

The scene in which he bids farewell to the dying Hephaestion is particularly bad. It's perfectly fine for Alexander to cry as he tries to comfort the person he best loves, but Farrell shows an unmanly lack of control. And the little speech in which he tells Hephaestion of all the wonderful things that remain to be done, as he looks out to the world, should have been something quite grand, quite stirring, but Farrell doesn't get much further than reading the lines.

Farrell is the right physical age for Alexander, but not the right emotional age. I remember a hetero guy in college -- not even 20 -- telling me how, when his best friend had died, he had cried himself to sleep for a month. Colin Farrell has either never experienced anything like this, or if he has, cannot convey it in his acting. He fails to bring those elements that would have at least partly compensated for the script's omissions.

Ultimately, an actor's failure can and should be blamed on the director, especially when the director does the casting. For a director such as Oliver Stone, who commands the complexities of such a huge film so effortlessly, this failure is remarkable. How he could have shot himself in the foot is hard to understand.

Nevertheless, ""Alexander Revisited"" is worth seeing, especially for the generally good script and fine performances from almost everyone but Farrell. (I had some initial problems with Val Kilmer as Philip, as we usually associate Kilmer with youthful roles, but it's an okay performance.)

Visually, ""Alexander Revisited"" is stunning. I've seen the DVD on a 36"" flat-face Sony, and this Blu-ray on a 60"" Kuro, and there is no comparison whatever. It's one of those rare films -- such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""2001"" -- that do not come across well on anything less than a large display.

* Contrast ""Troy"", in which Patroclus was turned from Achilles' younger-warrior-lover -- into his cousin! Good grief.

** The question of whether Philip had sexual relations with adult men -- uncommon in the Greek world -- is an interesting one. As his bodyguards would presumably have been old enough to be bearded, having sex with one of them would have been considered a bit odd -- though the rest of the Greek world viewed Macedonians as kinda strange, one contemporary writer stating that Macedonian men would freely allow other men to mount them. Stone shows bearded men who are roughly Philip's contemporaries hugging him and wrapping their arms around his shoulders, familiarities it seems odd for a king to permit. I presume Stone's implication is that these are men Philip is or was having sexual relations with.

*** Though he supposedly had a scanty beard, this is likely because he wanted to preserve the illusion -- at least for Hephaesition -- that he remained a ""beardless youth"". This, in turn, suggests other things I won't go into.",1268956800,,5837,4.869959677419355

Farrell and Jolie are too recognizable and don't fill the part.

Historically, the movie seems to buy into the whole mythology surrounding Alexander as a generous victor and advocate of liberty. The film starts with a historical inaccuracy -  the notion that Darius' army at Issus had hundreds of thousands of men (in fact, the Persian army was probably around the same size as Alexander's). Also, in the movie Alexander's father is portrayed as a drunken fool, but in real life he was quite a king himself who probably would have conquered the Persian empire in his own right.

But in a lot of other respects, the film is somewhat accurate and many of the anecdotes (such as Alexander's taming his horse as a child).

Of course there's no way a film about a bisexual soldier with an Oedipus complex could have ever played in American multiplexes, but now for home viewing we can see the film the way Stone wanted it to be, uncut and unapologetic in both its violence and its eroticism.

The Blu-Ray transfer is stunning, with vivid colors and a fantastic sound mix. And bargain priced, since it probably is not exactly flying off store shelves.",1244678400,4,819,4.794326241134752
2310189,2,B0009PLLN6,"The Bottom Line:

Too long to function as high camp and too silly to be watched with a straight face (Angelina Jolie's accent! Colin Farrell's haircut!), Alexander's only real success is to prove that the infamous 1963 version of Cleopatra didn't end big-budget sword and sandals fiascos.",1244505600,3,288,5.127659574468085
2310190,1,B0009PLLN6,"The title of my review says it all: I was so disappointed by this film. You would think that a great mind like Oliver Stone's would do something special with the story of one of history's most fascinating, least understood characters, but instead this movie is one convoluted mess. It wastes many talented actors (Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer, need I go on?) and mis-casts Colin Ferrell in a role that proves once and for all that the guy just can not act. The film is disjointed and careens wildly from gory battles, to confusing flashbacks, to yet another boring monologue by Alexander trying to rally his troops to keep on keeping on. If the real Alexander was so quirky and lacking in charisma, his troops would have turned around and gone home. Alexander must have been a mesmerizing persona to have done the things he did, but Colin Ferrell's portrayal isn't even good enough to call ""lackluster."" I suppose Stone had lots of grand ambitions for this sprawling film and talked quite a few people into participating in his vision. Unfortunately, his vision is obscured by a messy, confusing, unpleasant, and totally dissatisfying film. The only viewers who might enjoy this are those who want to see lots of gory battles, because there are plenty of those, but little else of note.",1242864000,4,1322,4.853982300884955
2310191,4,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander was released to theaters where it didn't do as well as it could of. This film is really a history buff's kind of movie. Yes, it has action, big names (Farrell, Jolie, Hopkins, and Kilmer) and is based on a lot of historical fact.  I think the homosexual relationships and the movies length and pacing are what killed it at the theater, which is what I have gathered from others when I have asked them about what they thought of it.

Personally, I have no problem with the relationships described in this film as it is pretty much a fact that all Greek men had male lovers back in the day.  This movie was paced for Hollywood in the original cut (some suit did that) and cut to make it more audience friendly.  The ensuing original product just felt rushed to me and I waited to watch this version; I was not disappointed by the story on either version but it was a better experience with the edit.

This version is put together entirely different and I think it is a better story and version of the film. The battle scenes are extended and there is a lot more character development. Kingdom of Heaven's re-cut and re-release is a better film than this one but this is very good and worth obtaining.

The Blu-ray transfer is very good......picture quality wise but the sound could be better. Overall, I would give this movie 4/5 because of the sound quality.  Dolby on a BD is good for a DVD but for being on BD there was a lot of GB space wasted on this film especially since you have to change disks to watch the whole movie.
I am still at a loss as to why you have to do this because of the storage capacity of BD but hey what do I know?

2310193,5,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"", in its theatrical release version, somehow managed the uncomfortable feat of being both too short and too long at the same time. On one hand, there were the endless narrations by Ptolemy and the general slow start of the movie with no battles in sight, on the other it somehow felt rushed and didn't have the moments of quiet and reflection a true epic needs.

Apparently Stone also thought so, because he made a second, significantly shorter cut, and now this longer version. Making the movie shorter was probably not a good idea, as in that direction the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Burton-movie/dp/B0002KPHW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Burton movie</a>&nbsp;lies, which was pretty decent for what it was. But if you make another film about Alexander the Great's life with a big budget, it makes more sense to give it a bigger scope and longer running length, which ""Alexander Revisited"" attempts to do, and for the most part successfully.

So now the movie looks more like what it probably was supposed to be from the start, with an intermission. I don't know why intermissions in longer movies have fallen out of fashion -- it certainly makes for a much better viewing experience, and Hollywood epics used to have them as the DVDs show. It certainly gives a movie a more grand and operatic feel and allows the audience a breather before the denouement. The theatrical release of ""Alexander"" was simply too much packed with events to be stomached in one sitting.

The structure of the film has changed a bit, with Alexander's death and the battle at Gaugamela being right up front. The constant jumps in time (""4 years later"", ""17 years earlier"", ""5 years later"", ""12 years earlier"", etc.) are still a bit confusing -- I think a chronological telling of the tale would have worked fine, maybe Stone should try that as the fourth variant? -- but on the whole the movie seems less cheesy and Farrell's performance seems to work better in the context of a longer movie. Maybe it's not is performance, just that you have more time to accommodate to the sight of him in a blond wig. Same for Val Kilmer as Philip.

Some parts are still edited a bit confusingly -- like the ""He too is Alexander"" scene, where all the close-ups don't make it very clear what's going on. A wide shot would have done wonders there, and might even have made the scene funny, which is direly needed in a movie relatively devoid of humor. But on the whole everything hangs together better.

Even the score by Vangelis seems less cheesy here. Perhaps in the theaters it was just the disappointment about hearing synthesizer music in a big-budget movie as if it was a made-for-TV production, but I'm beginning to realize that the music is actually very fitting. Since the movie tries to make out Alexander as some sort of visionary, it makes sense that the music would be more modern-sounding.

Also, since Aristotle survived Alexander, why not have the narration be delivered by him? The choice of Hopkins and Ptolemy seems like pandering to the audience, just so a (still-existing) Alexandria and the Library can be shown. Christopher Plummer brings zest, energy, and a little sarcasm to his relatively small role, and the movie would have profited from having him as a narrator instead of Hopkins.

The intermission comes a few minutes too late -- it should be right after the dramatic scene where Philip throws Alexander out of his palace, but instead it's right after a far less exhilarating scene where Alexander...descends from a mountain in the Hindu Kush and wearily comments, ""We must go on, until we find an end!"" One of those unintentionally funny clunker lines, as the same could be said about the movie itself. Bad placement!

All in a all, this is finally a worthy version of Alexander, with a definite streak of Fellini / Pasolini (the Bactria sequence) and ""Indiana Jones II"" (the India sequence). There are still Angelina Jolie's overblown lips, Jared Leto's hairstyle, the Klingon sex scene between Alexander and Roxane, English words written in Greek letters, and some other silly bits, but this is probably as good as it gets in terms of an Alexander biopic. The only question remains, why couldn't this have been the _first_ version?",1240012800,4,4318,4.962655601659751

Among them is the casting of Colin Farrell, who though not terribly bad, tends to overplay his scenes as Alexander yet other roles come out better such as Jolie's manipulative mother and Kilmer as Philip, the lustful father.  Also as inviting as the scenery and battle scenes is the luscious, exotic Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, the Persian beauty that Alexander claims but loses.

This movie tries, and in some measures it does succeed, like in the sets, costumes and some battle scenes, but the dialogue is sometimes a bit silly and sometimes the best dialogue went to supporting characters and not the main ones. I would never have cast Colon Farrell as Alexander. He tried, I think, but couldn't pull off what was needed to bring him to life. I prefered to watch Gary Stretch as Cleitus or Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander before Colin. They weren't even that overly important to the story.

2310205,2,B0009PLLN6,"Director Oliver Stone's film version of the life of Alexander the Great, came out to dismal reviews and worse box office. There were controversies over its portrayal of the bisexuality of its protagonist, as well as the poor screenplay, stilted dialogue, and many other things.... We get the requisite battles, the CGI armies of huge hordes, but Stone's camera work is not what it was a decade or more ago. There is very little that sets this apart as an Oliver Stone film. It's a generic pseudo-epic that makes the great epics, like Spartacus, or Lawrence Of Arabia, seem that much greater. I guess there's just a simple lack of passion in the whole endeavor. What saves the film from being total trash, however, is Val Kilmer's relationship with Alexander- mostly as a boy (Connor Paolo), but also with the older Farrell. Kilmer's best moment comes when he demands buying a horse at half price if Alexander can tame it. The son, of course, tames it, in generic rite of passage form, but the key that makes this otherwise trite scene work is how Philip will to risk his son's life merely for a bargain. It shows why the two men will bond, but never be truly close.... In short, Alexander fails not for many of the reasons the major critics roasted it (although to be fair, I don't know just how different the filmic and DVD versions are) but because it has too much breadth, and not enough depth. Accordingly- while not terrible, it's not great. Flip a coin over whether it's passable and either way you're probably right.",1220659200,,1523,4.644444444444445

What it doesn't have is an actor worthy of portraying this tormented dreamer, bent on conquering all of Asia. Stone has Colin Farrell, with bleached blonde hair and some of the worst line reading in history.
 Although Farrell isn't alone in his campy and over reaching acting skills, we have Angelina Jolie doing the best 'Natasha' voice since Rene Russo in the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", and the poorest acting by pretty-boy Jared Leto, in quite some time.

2310207,5,B0009PLLN6,"I liked Alexander Revisited so much that I have watched it at least a dozen times.  It has plenty of ""realistic"" action but also gets into the psychology of its characters.  I have much respect for the director  Oliver Stone for having the courage to portray the ""real"" Alexander, unlike Wolfgang Petersen, the director of Troy who tried to pawn Achelles' lover Petrocolus off as his ""cousin.""  That was contemptable.  The truth was that Alexander showed little personal interest in women.  The fact that he was bi-sexual (at most) did not detract from his being a colossus.
  Jared Leto was very convincing as Alexander's general and lover Hephaestian, not to mention that he was gorgeous.  I am sorry Francisco Bosch who played the eunuch Bagoas didn't get a higher billing as his character was important and he did a great job.  I think they could have found someone more suited than Colin Farrell to play Alexander. For one thing, he looked nothing like him.  Alexander was ""more beautiful"" than that. The horse that played Alexander's horse Bucephalus was an incredibly majestic animal!  What a warrier!
  I read in one review that Stone didn't stick to the facts.  I disagree.  It isn't easy to cram a life like that in three and a half hours, but the few things he altered were either to adher to the time limit or possibly for effect.  The way Alexander found Bagoas was ""simplified,"" and Bucephalus did not die in battle, but of old age at thirty. The general Cassander was one of the few of Alexander's boyhood companions not in his army because they hated each other.  But I'm glad Stone included him because Jonathan Rhys Myers who played that role is one of my favorites.  I'm sorry they didn't make more of the death of Hephaestian as in truth Alexander went into what some called a psychotic rage that lasted for sometime and had far-reaching consequences.  Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympius was magnificant, and again, authentic, even down to the snakes.",1219363200,2,1982,4.790560471976401

Many critics have rated Alexander negatively taking for example the battle scenes as messy and hard to follow but I believe the depiction of Gaugamela is true to history, we see Alexanders move to the flanks until he opens a breach in the Persian line which he uses to charge directly against Darius, we see the sarissa phalanx repelling the chariot attacks, all of this amid the chaos and dust of the battlefield which is a more accurate description than most Hollywood battle recreations that lack that sense of chaos and drama.

There are some exagerations such as the depiction of Babylon that should have been an impressive city for ancient standards but in this movie it looks like Manhattan but the architechture is mostly accurate, showing the zigurats and canals but omiting the dirt and grime that should have been in a colossal scale.

We are presented with an accurate description of the battle of Hydaspes in India where the scene of Alexander riding in Bucephalus charging the elephant is worth the admission price.

Details such as clothing, armor, the looks of the people are kept true to history and I believe the producers made a very thorough research into this area which is commendable.

There are some critics that condemn the homosexual tones of Alexander and Hephaestion's friendship but in ancient times homosexual relations were not shunned and in societies such as Sparta they were encouraged, remember the Sacred Band in Thebes which was formed of couples of homosexual lovers.  Modern greeks were the most vocal in the condemnation of this side of Alexander's character as depicted in the movie but they neglect some truths in their history and homosexual relationships did not carry the stigma of modern times, warriors seek the company of other warriors in the loneliness of campaigns and from great frisendships great romances could flourish.  If Alexander was indeed a homosexual will it diminish the greatness o his military conquests?  I believe not.

Other beautiful details are the great scenery especially when crossing the Pamir range in Afghanistan, Bucephalus could not have been better depicted as a magnificent beast, beautiful actresses such as Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson complemet an amazing cast, plus the outstanding soundtrack by Vangelis, make this movie a pleasue to watch.

Maybe Colin Farrel was miscast as Alexander and the job could be handled better by Heath Ledger or Leonardo Di Caprio who are natural blondes but I believe Farrel handled the character well enough and I could appreciate his great effort in portraying Alexander being of note his outstanding delivery of the battle speech at Gaugamela, maybe he was a little solemn and wooden but it didn't detract from the whole effect of the movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I still cannot understand why it got such low rating by critics who in turn gave rave reviews to Gladiator (best movie of 2000) and 300 which were fundamentally flawed at depicting history, in comparisson this is a much better movie and I sincerely recomend it.",1215475200,4,3403,5.0266429840142095

2310213,3,B0009PLLN6,"Three-and-a-half stars, actually.

The story of Alexander is so broad in scope it would be impossible to do it justice, but Oliver Stone has made a bold attempt at it. Some scenes work quite well. An example is the Battle of Gaugamela, with which Stone begins the epic (conflating it with the battle of Granicus in which Cleitus actually saved Alexander's life). Although I am not usually an enthusiast of battle scenes in glorious technicolor, I found Stone's depiction of Alexander's third major battle with Darius III quite thrilling. I was very interested in seeing the sarissas--the Macedonian long (and heavy) pikes--in action. I also appreciated Stone's labeling of the left, right, and center wings in an attempt to clarify Alexander's strategy of attacking the enemy at its strongest point rather than its weakest.

I found the Battle of the Hydaspes River with Porus less convincing. For one thing, Stone placed the mutiny at the Hypahsis before the battle with Porus and not after (In addition to facing monsoons, rotting clothes, fungus, disease, and  poisonous snakes, the army had to face King Porus and his elephants--the last straw on what by that time was a 17,000 mile march that made the troops demand that Alexander turn back). For another, the actual account of the Macedonian army  on one side of the Hydaspes River (the Jhelum) and the Indian army on the other side paralleling and trying to psych each other out is so much more exciting. Although the rearing and roaring of the elephants (and the resulting bloody mess) was effective, the armies did not fight in the middle of a tree-glutted jungle, but on a sandy spot where there was room to maneuver. Since Stone also conflated the Hydaspes (in which the 31-year old Bucephalus died from injuries) with the Battle with the Mallians, where Alexander was shot in the lung, the surrender of Porus to Alexander (one of the great moments) got dropped. In fact Stone stole Porus' line of wanting to be treated like a king, and reassigned it to Stateira at Babylon, who wanted to be treated like a princess (big deal!).

In addition to the Gaugamela scene, the flashbacks worked quite well; in fact, I think the flashbacks to Alexander's childhood and youth, probably worked the best as far as explicating the story, which is actually a bit of a mess after Babylon.

And while I can see that it might not be practical, not to mention impossible, to present all the highlights of the saga, the omission of Alexander's burning of Persepolis is simply inexcusable; and Stone also missed a couple of great opportunities, first, by not showing Alexander's armies moving through the burning oil fields between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and next, by omitting the ""Macedonian flyers"" climbing of the Soghdian rock, which is where Alexander is said to have met and married Roxane (Her introduction to Alexander in the movie, not to mention the animalistic love scene that seems to have been intended to demonstrate Alexander's latent heterosexuality to those who are bothered by Hephaistion and Bagoas, was both tacky and lame).

As for the characters, Anthony Hopkins gave the elderly Ptolemy--dictating his memoirs--a touch of class (But did Ptolemy's scribes who are shown following him around with their laptop papyrus desks really have pens that didn't need to be dipped into ink?); and Christopher Plummer made a suitably distinguished Aristotle. However, I could have done without Angelina Jolie's pseudo-Epirot accent; and Colin Farrel's five-o'clock shadow made him look more like Alexander the Wimp. Stone also omitted major characters that would have added immensely to the plot, including Callisthenes, Aristotle's nephew who objected to Alexander's dressing in Persian style and making the Macedonians prostrate themselves on the ground (plot-points that got lost in this production), and Stone also omitted Aristander of Telmessus, Alexander's soothsayer and damage-control czar, who used the omens to explain Alexander's increasingly bizarre behavior as he moved farther away from civilization.

I did not see the first versions of this film, so I cannot compare this one with them; and while I found ""Alexander Revisited"" interesting--partly because the actual story is so fascinating--I feel that Oliver Stone missed the sweeping scope that the story would have had at the hands--say--of David Lean.

2310222,2,B0009PLLN6,"Ever since seeing `Gladiator' I have been obsessed with the swords-and-sandals epics.  Sadly there hasn't been a film since to really capture all that `Gladiator' was able to capture.  That said, I had really high hopes for `Alexander'.  Oliver Stone is truly a visionary director, if not highly misunderstood.  Some of his films reach levels of greatness (`Natural Born Killers') while others are overshot even for him and fail miserably (`World Trade Center').  `Alexander' falls somewhere in the middle.  It has moments of superbly crafted greatness, yet it has many other moments of meandering mediocrity.  The cast is filled to the brim with big names, yet it is the smallest names that work the best here, and while the film is shot with a truly epic scope it fails to embrace the gritty grandeur that is the very definition of `epic'.

Telling the story of Alexander the Great and his rise to power is a hefty assignment.  He's on of the most recognizable faces in World History and his story is one of the most interesting and commanding.  Alexander truly defined the word `great' and his life should lead to one fantastic film.  Sadly Stone doesn't seem to really grasp all that could be had here.  He sees facets of Alexander's life, facets mostly unknown to the American public, and attempts to uncover them and them alone in a way of `enlightening' us.  The problem is that the most memorable and interesting parts of Alexander's life are thus left barely breached.  First and foremost Alexander was a warrior, a leader, a man who conquered the known world at the young age of thirty.  `Alexander' the film never really fleshes out this warrior in him.  The opening line in the film refers to Alexander as a god; but the film never gives us any reason to think so.

The action sequences, while decent, are really just that; decent.  I expected so much more from these (especially when word got out about the elephants) but I was disappointed at the amount of confusion these battles led to.  They are choppy and hard to follow.  Another area of complaint was the sets themselves.  While they looked authentic to a degree, everything seemed `too' authentic; if that makes any sense.  Especially in the scenes involving Old Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins); I just felt like I was in a museum.

The acting is also a sore spot.  Much has been said in regards to Angelina's poor accent, and while it didn't bother me to the extent that it bothered critics, it really was terrible.  Val Kilmer was atrocious here, and Anthony Hopkins was easily forgettable, which is very uncommon for him.  Jared Leto plays Hephaistion horrifically.  It's sad because his character could have been marvelously portrayed.  It's such a baity role; male lover, friend and advisor to the king; but instead he plays him so subdued and brittle you would never get the impression he was a warrior alongside the king.  He's too much of a badly portrayed stereotype if you get my drift.

Colin Farrell on the other hand scores well here.  Many critics balked at his portrayal of the doomed king, but I actually think that Farrell did a superb job.  He goes through so many emotions it would have been easy for any actor to get lost in them and fumble through them so-to-speak but Colin maneuvers himself through this cast array of emotions effortlessly.  I was stunned at his presence.  I have been watching him for a while now and have been so happy with his steady rise in the ranks.  Films like `Tigerland', `Phone Booth' and `Alexander' show what this guy is capable of.  Rosario Dawson also delivers a well crafted performance.  As Roxane, Alexander's bride, she captures her raw exotic persona that made her the woman she was.  While Stone makes it a point to rest Alexander's heart in the hands of men we are able to get a glimpse of the passion Roxane sparked within his soul despite his extramarital longings.

One area I can give it the greatest of praise though is the score, which elevates the film in a way and delivers a marvelous tone and mood.  It's beautiful in every way possible.

Like I mentioned on the outset; there are moments here that work very well.  This has to do with Farrell's dedication and determination to make it work.  There are just too many moments that don't work for this to be considered a great film, or even a good one.  It moves very slowly in scenes, and while I enjoy a slow-moving character study as much as the next `quote-unquote' critic, I still like to be interested in the subject.  `Alexander' moves at such a pace that it loses the audience in many places.  Oliver Stone might have undershot this one, not taking it to the places it could have gone.  He really could have gone there, taken it to that next level.  With a subject like Alexander the Great you almost have the responsibility to make it big and bold but sadly for the most part `Alexander' is long and dull and uneventful.",1207267200,5,4923,4.663182346109175
2310223,1,B0009PLLN6,"It's interesting to read such a wide variety of reviews of the same film.  I saw it when it was first released in theatres.  I really don't remember much about it except that the variety of of accents used by the actors seemed odd at best.  I recently bought (it was being remaindered) and viewed this new version of the film.  Watching it was sort of a Lenten penance for me.  I found it really, really boring.  I think there are two basic problems with the film, Stone and Farrel.  Stone chatters on in an introduction to the film about how he's improved the thing (but is remarkably vague about what he thinks he's accomplished).  It seems to me that about all he really accomplished was to make the film longer...Yes, I know he changed the structure, but to no particualrly good effect.  As for Farrel's performance, had I been one of the troops led by a man so lacking in presence, I'd have refused to even move forward, much less fight.  Watch carefully, and you'll see that whenever Alexander is shown in battle, Farrel presents him with a wide eyed stare and open mouth that look like nothing so much a sheer terror. The sexuality of the film seems sterile at best.  The character development is nil.  I could go, but suffice to say that it really doesn't work for me at all, and since I'm a great lover of film, that's rare.",1207180800,3,1333,4.418032786885246
2310224,3,B0009PLLN6,"I bought this disc just to see how great it would look in HD. This movie is demo quality. There are several spectacular scenes that perfectly show off the HD medium.

However, I still cannot like this movie. My main problem is with Colin Farrell in the lead. He just does not come off as the charismatic leader the real Alexander was. His Irish brogue seems out of place, and he lacks the heroic quality required for the role. In his speech before the battle of Gaugemela, he attempts a ""Crispin's Day"" clarion call at the end of the speech that is so poor, my wife and I actually chuckled. The ""honeymoon scene"" with Rosario Dawson is equally inept. It was as if Stone had not written anything for the scene, and let the actors ""improv"" the scene. Dawson pushes and hits at Farrell, while Farrel hisses like a cat. Again, more unintentional humor.

It seemed to me that Stone just could not produce a good script for this film, so it never gels. However, he shot in some great locations,and there is some fine CGI enhancement of some scenes. I find it worth watching for the visual impact, but for little else. One of those films in which the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.",1205971200,,1187,4.415525114155251
2310225,5,B0009PLLN6,"The film:

It's kind of funny how popular entertainment works. All I remember hearing about Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is that it was a horribly acted, poorly constructed shambles of a movie. Scanning the torrent of vituperative scorn heaped upon this film will give you an idea of the climate at the time of its release. Needless to say, I was dubious. Any movie that scores lower than Jessica Simpson's ""Dukes of Hazzard"" must be an abomination, right?

However, I am a Stone fan, and was inclined to offer the benefit of the doubt. I loved JFK, Nixon and Natural Born Killers, and enjoyed Any Given Sunday and The Doors. At his best, Stone excels at getting truly absorbing character portraits up on the screen, and setting them against an expansive backdrop which captures the essence of the period.

Alexander, starring Collin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto and Christopher Plummer, both succeeds and fails in these categories. Some of the characters are endlessly fascinating, some are rather threadbare. Certain aspects of the period are wonderfully represented, and some are sort of left up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Some performances are pitch perfect, others, while enjoyable, are painfully weird and out of place. All told, Alexander is somewhat weak in comparison with Stone's best.

So why did I enjoy it so much?

Looking at the above-listed stars, it's easy to see that Stone has assembled a particularly good ensemble cast. The weakest of the bunch are Farrell and Jolie. However, each actor does an admirable job of creating a character, Farrell and Jolie included. If anything, Jolie's performance is hampered only by her youth (she is only one year Farrell's senior, yet plays his mother), and her wretched accent (somewhere between Eartha Kitt and Austin Powers' Frau Farbissina). Farrell's performance is just a bit shallow - he looks heroic and manly in battle sequences, certainly, but doesn't do much beyond that. Sometimes, he really seems to nail complex emotions. Other times, it's just a bit poster-board and flat.

The rest of the cast, however, including the lesser-known supporting players in Alexander's army, are uniformly terrific. Particularly good are Plummer as Aristotle, Kilmer as a drunken King Philip, Hopkins as an aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Alexander's male lover, Hephaistion. Rosario Dawson plays Alexander's asian bride Roxane, though beyond her pendulous naked breasts and dancing ability, I can't say I got much out of it (Dawson really shines in 2005's Sin City, though). To me, though, the performance that makes the movie what it is is by Connor Paolo, as a young Alexander. This 14 year-old actor absolutely nails the portrayal of a young, idealistic prince with adolescent dreams of grandeur. This portrayal really lends a depth to the later plot, acted by Farrell, which Farrell himself really doesn't provide.

But any Stone movie review eventually comes down to Stone himself. How well did he construct the story, and how well did he execute it and edit it together?

My main gripe with the story of Alexander is its naivete. I really have to wonder how historically accurate it is to portray Alexander as an idealistic dreamer who longed to unite the world in a Pax Romana-esque explosion of culture and personal improvement. Certainly, all of these things may have been present in the man, and they may have been ancillary effects of his conquest, but it is pretty tough to swallow as Farrell dreamily describes his vision of a great society to his male lover Leto. The story functions much better when Alexander is instead portrayed as a conqueror impelled by his family demons to push across the globe for something he knows not what.

Nonetheless, the film is truly wondrous at times in its evocation of ancient times and places - Babylon is a singular cinematic achievement - utilizing CGI nearly seamlessly to truly give the impression of a ""wonder of the world."" Similarly teriffic cinematography and composition are achieved in portrayals of India, Egypt and the steppes of the Himalayas. The scenes of Greece and Macedonia also shine, especially in HD, really placing you there in the time. This film is Stone at his finest visually, creating a world which draws you in.

I for one really liked the way the so-called ""gay"" element of the movie was handled - watching Alexander provides one of the better explications of the homosexual ""lover-beloved"" relationships that were present in Hellenistic noble circles. Again, this concept was grounded by scenes of the young Alexander and Hephaiston being taught by Aristotle about the idealistic virtues of manly love - scenes which brought into sharp focus what could have seemed gratuitous homoerotic later scenes between Leto, Farrell, and a few others. It's a part of Greek history, and Stone kept it in as a big theme, instead of bending to anachronistic puritanism. Kudos to him for that.

Besides Stone's possible anachronistic interpretation of Alexander's world-uniting motives, historically, this film really can't be faulted. It is true to the sources we have, be they Plutarch and Herodotus, or more modern scholars. Those sources may be tinged by legend or political agenda, but they are all we have. This is a movie which you could show a professor, who would be hard pressed to point out a major error (unlike the barely recognizable ""history"" of ""Kingdom of Heaven."") I would also say, as is Stone's talent, this movie makes you feel like YOU ARE THERE. I would show this film to students to get them excited about the Hellenistic period. (Though at 214 minutes, it might take two class periods...)

As you have read, this cut is 214 minutes. Certainly, this is a long movie. But Stone, in his ability to create scene and to really transport the viewer, makes this movie fly by. It felt like 2 hours, not 3 and a half. Stone has re-ordered the fragmented structure of the film. The previous director's cut grouped various scenes closer together by time period - Alexander's childhood was one big chunk, then his travels were another, intercut with his early reign and death. This cut, on the other hand, basically takes the two time periods (childhood through early reign; travels across Asia and death) and skips back and forth between them, each line running roughly forward. Both cuts can be followed, especially if you have some knowledge of Greek history. I have to say I prefer the first director's cut a bit, since I found the childhood scenes so strong, it was nice to have them in a chunk. But this cut still works. The added material fleshes out the side characters much better than the previous two cuts, which is welcome in any case.

Alexander is an enigmatic movie. It fails at so much, but only because it tried for so much. I was completely absorbed and never bored once during the 3.5 hour running time. I felt transported to the world it created, and my emotions were stirred in a simplistic way by the scenes of glory and adventure on the screen. Ptolemy (played by Hopkins) utters a line which might serve as the movie's epitaph: ""His failures were grander than others' successes."" So true of Stone. He wears his ambition on his sleeve, is rarely if ever subtle, and draws a lot of critical fire for this. Yet the explosion of creativity which results, whether it succeeds or fails, is never boring. I recommend Alexander for this reason alone.

Let me put it another way: This is a movie that got critically bashed, and I can't really discern why. It's better than ""Dukes of Hazzard."" It's also better than ""Revenge of the Sith,"" a film from around the same time which received many positive reviews despite its bizarre dialogue, paper-thin character motivations, and plot holes. It's got its problems, but it is also big fun if you're a fan of the historical epic genre, the director, or of the historical period.

The disc:

As far as the quality of the Blu-Ray presentation, let me put it simply. I own Planet Earth, 2001, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Prestige, all renowned for their sterling HD transfers. Alexander tops them all in terms of detail and color.  You know how some Blu-Ray discs look fine enough, but really seem like something a particularly good DVD could do? The aforementioned ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is one such disc to me. This Blu-Ray presentation leaves you with no doubt. This is High Definition, pure and simple, and no 480p DVD disc could do what this disc does. On my 50"" SXRD display, the detail is overwhelming, the color is beyond rich and vibrant, and the 3-dimensionality is extraordinary, especially in the festival scene in Greece, the scene in the cold mountain pass, and in the Babylon entrance scene. At its best, this is THE demo disc to really show off your system. There are a few spots where black levels falter (such as the palace in India) or flesh tones are a little hot (Aristotle springs to mind), but these flaws represent 5 minutes or so out of a 214 minute experience. The rest of the film is nothing short of flawless, and the visual splendor aids in drawing you into the film.

The extra materials also excel - two commentaries including a director's track and a historical overview by Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, two documentaries with amazing behind the scenes access, and a bevy of other features. Really first rate.

If you like history, this is a movie to get. If you like great HD, this disc is a no-brainer. If you like neat and tidy 90 minute films which spoon feed you the plot and who to root for/against, this is NOT the movie for you. It is complex, confusing at times, ambiguous in its morality, violent, lusty, raw, and disgusting. But that's history... have you ever read the bible? Yeesh. This is a movie which inspires love and hate all at once. I for one find it utterly spellbinding, even though I am well aware of its flaws. In the end, I think this is completely appropriate for its subject matter: Alexander the Great, a historical figure who, warts and all, you can't simply ignore and would do well to study. I give this disc 5 stars for its technical brilliance, its creative spark, and its sheer, mesmeric ""movie magic.""",1202428800,22,10205,4.8344788087056125

I think the movie, like a few others, was trying to cash in on the success of the Russell Crowe movie Gladiator. It was over long, focused too much on Alexanders sexuality and had the dumbest casting. I mean Angelina Jolie as Farrells mother was just plain nonsensical. Val Kilmer was really horrible too which is a suprise cause he usually is really good. But the major flaw is the story itself. It tries to tell too big of a story in a limited amount of time.

2310230,4,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander Revisited is Oliver Stone's final word on the great leader and his attempt to capture all Alexander accomplished on film.  While this final cut doesn't even remotely tackle all that was wrong with the initial theatrical release (i.e. the sometimes intrusive narration by Anthony Hopkins, the at times sluggish pace of the film, and most importantly at times muddled plotting and dialogue. ) it does however broaden the scope of the film.  Alexander Revisited has an extra 40 minutes and has been re-cut to allow the viewer freer access to Alexander and the world he occupied and ultimately conquered.

Collin Farell does an admirable job of portraying the various layers of Alexander's personality; even though at times he does ham it up a bit.  But from all I've read Alexander could be quite the drama queen himself so it was fitting.  Anthony Hopkins while at times intrusive with his narration is also very necessary tot the film because of the way it has been laid out.  Jared Leto is very good as the loyal Hephisation, even if the eye makeup was a slapped on with a pain brush.

Don't buy this film looking for a masterwork, because it's not.  It's not even in the top five films Oliver Stone has ever made.  But it is a solid piece of work that tries to lay bare a man who is still in many ways shrouded in mystery and probably always will be; a man who after his death was worshipped, and even to this day his battlefield tactics are studied and copied.  Alexander the Great opened up the world and paved the way for many advances (cultural and religious) that other leaders took advantage of after his death.  In his own lifetime he was as praised as his mythical hero Achilles, he was more feared and loved than any leader before or after him. He led an army of no more than fifty-to-sixty thousand against an army of nearly two hundred thousand and won. He created a mobile kingdom and an army that never, never coherently revolted against him even when they saw him changing in front of their eyes.  He went from being a Macedonian king to a global king who tried to embrace each culture he came in contact with. And yet we get his definitive biography from Plutarh who lived five hundred years after Alexander died.

Oliver Stone tried mightily with his film to take the enormous life of Alexander the Great and put it before us in a way that is entertaining if not perfect.  All that Alexander did can never be up on film the way it should be, it has however been put before us with the loving care of a man who put all he could into its telling.

This film isn't for everyone, nor dare I say was it ever meant to be.  Those who liked the theatrical release will like this, those who trashed it will trash this or any version of the film.  I say give it a chance if you've never seen it, and if you were on the fence about it before try this version of it and see if you can't come to a conclusion.",1200268800,3,2923,4.403345724907063
2310231,5,B0009PLLN6,"Well,

I think this film, now improved from merely great to purely brilliant, is really doing things with its subject matter that the viewing public is unable to appreciate.

People complain about it's being not very dramatically involving, unengaging etc.  Yes, that's because it is presented more in the fashion of a History Channel documentary (complete with narration by Ptolemy as he writes memoirs).  It is fundamentally undramatized, it is just an historically accurate set of snippets from Alexander's life, presented in a peculiar mixed-up order.  The mixed-up order is designed not for our convenience of understanding, but rather as the best way to slowly illuminate the man.

This slow illumination makes the film in essence a study of the phenomenon of ""greatness"".  What is a ""great"" man?  Stone is admittedly obsessed with this idea, which is why he undertook to cut the same movie three times.

Another aspect totally over the heads of 99% of viewers (and especially film critics, who generally are so tone-deaf it is sad) is the incredibly rich interplay between film and soundtrack.  The film, and in particular example the battle of Gaugamela, is like an audio-visual ballet.  If you are incapable of understanding Vangelis' electro-acoustic neoclassical score (performed by a combination of synthesizers, a symphony orchestra, and choirs), then you are not going to enjoy this movie.  In fact I think Stone would agree with me when I say that the whole movie would be pretty much reduced to B.S. were it not for this score and the audio-visual interplay that it provides.  It would be like an opera without the songs or the orchestra.

Sometimes everyone is wrong, and one person went beyond our reach.  That is the case here, considering the broad dislike of this film.  I have also seen the Director's (2nd) cut, and great as it is, it isn't as great as this final cut.

Thank you Oliver and congratulations, you are now the world's greatest filmmaker (in partnership with Vangelis).",1199232000,,2005,5.009063444108762
2310232,5,B0009PLLN6,"I'm an Alexandrophile. You can call me the Alexander geek. However, I'm no victim to hagiography, for I truly believe that this guy is as much a mass murderer as he's fascinated me since I ran into him in the library when I was little. Having said that, I have to appreciate Oliver Stone's sincere effort in bringing this larger than life character on to a motion picture.

Though Alex's hairdo was terrible, except up to Gaugamela (Actually, Colin Farrell doesn't really bring that mel gibson's braveheart character mania/charisma on to the screen, Alex deserves a better actor), the costumes and art design were terrific. Though I was a bit disappointed by the depiction of Greeks (with runway models hairstyle, for we shouldn't forget they were a barbaric tribe of goatherders, who simply liked to call others barbarians), the depiction of Persians and the Indians were perfect. I'm actually of Indian origin and could clearly tell the Asian sets were more than perfect. The only bad point being that many of the Indian soldiers are depicted fighting without basic fighting armour, while the elephants were actually fabulous.

But the actual tragedy of the movie was the Alex/Hephaestion intimate conversations. It was more pathetic and laughable than some lifeless south american soap opera, with all the longing looks and soft words.

Apart from this, I truly appreciate Stone's sticking to historic authenticity. Alexander actually lost the battle in India. And Stone's similar depiction is sincere, responsible, honest and spectacular, given that western historians had always resorted to greek-oriented propaganda of the invincible Alexander, owing to centuries of romance and hagiography.

Stone could have been more authentic in the battles. But he's taken the liberty to merge the events of Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela into one battle. Also, the ones at Jhelum, Hydaspes and the Malvian campaign, where Alex truly got his arrow. These aren't spoilers though as Stone's apparently done this for better dramatization. The gordian knot and the oracle at Siwa could have been crammed somewhere, but oh well.

There also have been other elements which simply could have been done otherwise. Like, where old Ptolemy defends Alex for trying to reconcile Greek and barbarian. For, the Persians and the Indians were of a far superior civilization than the Greeks. Plus history has it that, after crossing Bactria, in one of the first Indian campaigns, Alex massacred around 80,000 Indians for having resisted the Greeks. To me, reconciliation with my countrymen could have been better achieved without that five figure genocide.

There's also something disturbing which the movie synopsis claims. That Alex's bloody campaigns paved the way for Christianity to spread. Though this could be fortuitously right, it clearly undermines the principles of Christianity to pave the way for Christ's teaching via 40 years of global mass genocide.

The earliest Christians were never Alexandrophiles. Not until pagan Rome took over Christianity, when men like Alex received a blank cheque owing to the hagiography which was prominent among the Roman elite, apparently and shamelessly borrowed by the post 4th century Popes.

This movie is good. All credit to Stone. It could have been better. But it's never bad. One just has to turn elsewhere during scenes of Alex's bisexuality, which are actually annoying.",1198886400,,3403,5.265682656826568
2310233,4,B0009PLLN6,"Like pearls before swine is this under-rated film before the steroidal masses.

There have been a few films of ancient legends either classical or medieval that have earned some attention as epics in this decade. They are the following:

2000--Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott.
2004--Troy, directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
2004--Alexander, directed by Oliver Stone.
2005--Kingdom of Heaven, directed by Ridley Scott.
2006--300, directed by Zack Snyder.

The masses seem to have their tastes backwards, as they are facing the rear rather than forwards. They have no idea the difference between a good epic from a bad one. Even the critics have had occasional lapses of good judgment. Although critics usually tend to come through properly, they have severely undercut one film in particular: Alexander.

Epics are supposed to provoke the feelings of the films of Cecil B. DeMille, David Lean, Kubrick, and Ray Harryhausen. They are not supposed to be merely brutish, nor turn episodes of historical periods into steroidal glorifications. I suppose some idiot is sitting in the back row of the theater telling everyone else, ""You can't blame a film when it makes money."" Suddenly, everyone forgets what taste means! What ""ought to be popular"" is not the point of a historical epic.

The point is tragic heroism. Aristotle, in his work Poetics, has explained the keys of what defines a work as a tragedy. A tragedy has a hero, and a hero is a character who sets out on a mission, usually called a quest, to find something or do something, whether it's in finding an object like a golden fleece or a cup of the Christ's blood, in killing a certain monster, or in committing oneself to a mission on behalf of virtue. It is when the hero, usually the story's protagonist, makes a fatal error in judgment due to his personality--but not merely a victim of circumstance--then returns to it with a commitment toward something admirable in a way that has an end result of large proportion and catharsis.

For instance, in the 2007-animated film Beowulf, the title character sets out to destroy a monster in which he becomes seduced by it instead, falling prey in such a way that his error would later result in the destruction of an entire city. The only way for him to resolve the matter is to selflessly destroy himself in the process of killing the dragon. When he dies to redeem himself for his error, he is acting honorably in his intentions, and therefore is defined as a tragic hero. A tragedy is usually thought of as having and ending with a hero's demise, but sometimes a story having a happy ending would still be regarded as tragedy according to Aristotle. The film Jason and the Argonauts, a film with a happy ending, would be a Greek tragedy. The seriousness and broad landscape of the action make it a tragedy.

Oliver Stone's film Alexander has not only the capacity for a greatness in which it is eclipsed somewhat by masterpieces like Lawrence of Arabia does not detract from the comparison, and where that film is worth five full stars, Stone's Alexander is worthy of a lesser rating: in the vicinity of four stars for its mild flaws. Yet, the film has been criticized all over the place in ways I've never even heard of films being criticized before! And, this really just shows how people have blindly hated it for its unique qualities. How can anyone criticize Stone's portrayal of the ancient Greeks by delving into bisexuality where men thought of themselves as gods? This just makes no sense! Criticize the film for having confusing battle scenes and perhaps I could agree, but to criticize it as hateful merely because it shows Alexander crying over dead friends on a battlefield is blatantly a disregarding of the historical fact and of pure cinema. People assume that what made Alexander so great is that he was a stoic and merciless killer. So, for Stone and actor Colin Farrell to paint him as emotional was apparently too much for today's U.S. audiences to comprehend in their small mindedness, easing what they think they know about the historical person. And, what of their small mindedness? It seems the U.S. interpretation of Greek legends is much different than reality and true Greek idealization, as the masses have turned reality and Greek ideals into corn-fed masochisms and idiotic, inhuman, and idiosyncratic notions of steroidal football players.

As far as mass popularity, Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe, was a financial success. And, we know why. It has rather intense action, but it evokes two other films: DeMille's Sign of the Cross and Kubrick's Spartacus, the former being a decent-but-memorable grandiose epic of the 1930s and the latter being one of the highlight epics of the 1960s. The photography of Gladiator is not only gritty, it's poetic. It's a good film; where it lacks in certain elements of plot, it makes up for in visuals, directing, and great acting, especially Joaquin Phoenix. However, the film deserves a rating of merely above average. Yet, it was still popular in the U.S.

Where director Ridley Scott made a financial success in a historical setting, he would propel a much greater film of worth in Kingdom of Heaven--the Road Show version known as ""the Director's Cut."" He again emulates an idea shaped as early as 1935 in Cecil B. DeMille's film The Crusades. Where American audiences complained of forming political references and anti-Christian views, they had not realized that the theme in which they have resorted to superficial criticism was essentially the same theme of DeMille, the director responsible for such epics as The Ten Commandments, a film which DeMille directed twice, the latter remake being the most critically-acclaimed and remembered biblical epic of all time! No one would dare accuse Mr. DeMille of being anti-Christian, but DeMille's same statement of The Crusades, made from Ridley's perspective, has now been distorted into an anti-Christian meaning it never had!

Kingdom of Heaven's American audiences were thin despite wide acceptance in Europe, and despite Roger Ebert who reviewed it with his highest star rating. The film discusses morality and justice in addressing faith rather than insinuating anti-Christian or pro-Muslim stances, as the film's critics have tried to assert. As did DeMille's film The Crusades, Ridley's Kingdom of Heaven brings together two sets of people through religious principles rather than adding to the coldness. Perhaps the American masses don't care to do any thinking. Obviously, Kingdom of Heaven is far superior to Gladiator when comparing Ridley Scott's two historical epics. It is worthy of four stars of five, or four-and-a-half of five if possible. Some of the aggression at this film has been speculated by other critics to have been caused by the movie's lesser theatrical version, which was shortened by a whopping 45 minutes from the original Road Show Director's Cut version, cutting out the meat and potatoes of the story. If there is one film on video reason enough to get into the high-def format, this film is it.

And, now let's see where the masses have embraced the truly horrible films of Troy and 300, the latter film pertaining to the Spartan war against Persian invaders. First off, 300 has none of the virtues of either Kingdom of Heaven or Alexander, but it has made a lot more money from the American masses. Yet, the film is terrible! It is more about half-naked WCW ""wrestlers"" than anything intelligent: a series of cinematic postcards without any plot depth whatsoever! No one cares about any of this film's characters, because there is no reason to care. It is just a lot of running of guys who have all had their teeth sharpened. This film deserves two stars--three would be overdoing it. The plot is as flimsy as they come; if it hadn't been spelled out in a basic humanities text, there would be nothing in this film worthy of mention. 300 makes Stone's film Alexander look like a masterpiece!  Zack Snyder isn't even close to comparable to any of the other directors in my film list above.  The film 300 is so boring that its brownish photography presents me with Montezuma's Revenge.

And Troy was better, but not by much! It is another stuffed shirt. It's a way to watch Brad Pitt tan, and its cinema and its Greek story here seems usable for little else to support its cardboard characters. This film gets three stars, tops. Petersen, its director, has made good films before. This isn't one of them.

I don't see why people have completely disregarded the cinema in its classic form from the '60s.  When Peter O'Toole walked through the desert, people gravitated toward it like an oasis. But, today's mass pop culture can't recognize a Greek mythological tragedy from a Cheerio box. Yet, I'm supposed to accept people's word about Stone's Alexander epic, because it makes THEM comfortable! Something's dreadfully wrong, and it isn't me, nor is it Stone's Alexander. The critics and masses are wrong about this film just as they were wrong in 1982 about Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner, although to a lesser extent, which means that these critics won't recognize their mistake this time because Alexander is not a great film, but just a good one.",1198627200,2,9220,4.931056701030927

2310235,4,B0009PLLN6,"Am I alone in realizing the inherent beauty of ""Alexander"". Colin Farrell deserved an Oscar for those last few moments alone, on his deathbed. As much as a non-fan as I am of Colin, even I had to admit that this is perhaps his best performance on screen, even better than his one in ""A Home at the Center of the World"".

One thing that might turn off viewers is the stunning Angelina Jolie with an accent you will either love or hate. Its hard to be neutral to this accent. Its pretty much the same accent she had on in both ""Beowulf"" AND ""A Mighty Heart"" which leads me to believe that this woman is wretched at putting on a specific accent for a film. Whether its Eastern European, Greek, Mixed-Race, or Black, Jolie sounds exactly the same - a weird Mediterranean meets Shakira accent that I couldn't quite get into. I think this was the films' only negative.

The superb direction inevitably made me want to compare this to ""Kingdom of Heaven"", a movie that this shares many similarities with. However, I must say that this is not a classic as that film is, though it does have its' moments. Yes, I too had problems accepting a bleach-blond Colin Farrell in the beginning, and the tedious narration by Anthony Hopkins is almost hilarious, but it strangely works.

Also, Alexanders' two major love stories - one with Hephastion, his male friends, and the other with what is seemingly his jungle-queen wife - are treated with respect, but also with caution. There is an unnecessary scene of heterosexual copulation that bordered on the absurd, and I only wish they had deleted this from the final cut of the film. As expected, the same-sex angle is conveniently relegated to second side-show, with the two men occasionally hugging and patting each other on the back as if they were long lost brothers. Many viewers found this a little too 'safe', and so did I.

Doubtless, the many flaws this film has only make it more enjoyable. It IS long, but it has its share of cheesy moments, scenes of grandeur, and a script that comes alive at the most unexpected places. For all its cliches and horrible accents, this is a film that is awash in color and brightness, and Colin Farrell's single-minded devotion to his childhood sweetheart is only revealed to us during the films' climax, which was to me far more affecting than other historical films of this genre.

I must say that I didn't like Anthony Hopkins' role that much, but Val Kilmer had a memorable one.  The battle scenes played out well, but may have been a bit perfunctory.

He fails, in my opinion, in a most watchable catastrophic fashion, and because of that, I found myself admiring his chutzpah.

The story has been well described in these various reviews. It's a dizzying attempt to cover the life of Alexander The Great.

Many terrific actors (Kilmer, Jolie, etc.) give it their all. You can see them trying...even Colin Farrell. You can't say he doesn't commit to the role.

Much has been written about the emphasis on homosexuality in this cut, and it is pervasive. I mean that the relationship with Hephaestion (Jared Leto) is arguably the central plot of the film.  This apparently accurately reflects historical data...but Stone almost makes it into a political statement. I just found it a little weird that it was emphasized SO much. I heard someone say that this film made ""Rent"" look like ""Dirty Harry."" I don't know if I'd go THAT far, but I see their point.

It is beautifully shot; the war scenes are done well...technically it is what you would expect.

From a storytelling perspective, this is an unqualified disaster. The timeshifting back and forth is so disorienting, even the titling doesn't help. (""Eight years earlier"", ""Four years later""...back and forth...back and forth...)

The lines alternate between literate and cheesy, but all good epics have some of that...

Did the movie convey the temper of the times and what it might actually have been like to have campaigned toward what must have seemed the ends of the earth?  Yes.  Another point, though: if violence and the full range of human sensuality and sexuality might offend, don't pick this up.  However, if you want to get a genuine feel for those violent and sensual times, I recommend this.

Fortunately, too, the film utilized Robin Lane Fox, a biographer of Alexander, as a technical source.  So, even when Stone might have seemed to have pushed the edge here and there, historical context extisted in which to ground some of his interpretations--or there's no specific evidence either way and Stone's interpretation is as fair and truthful as anyone's.

2310245,4,B0009PLLN6,"This is a pretty amazing film. It has a highly talented cast yet there is a tendency to overacting that makes the film to have more in common with 1950s Hollywood epics like ""The Ten Commandments"" rather than with more naturalistic, realistic contemporary films. Since all the actors overact, with the exceptions of Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Hephaestus, the blame must reside with the director. The historic record would point to Alexander the Great as a tremendous egomaniacal and charismatic leader. Yet here the script tries to elevate Alexander's mission beyond conquest and discovery into some vague concept of universal respect for diversity which may be a contemporary value but was probably not a value of the ancient world of conquest. Listen to the dialogue where Alexander argues with his generals about his desire that they take wives and produce children among the nations they overcome rather than focus on returning to their wives and children in Macedonia with vast treasures and slaves. An argument could be made that he wished to find a way to sustain his victories, which may occur if the victor impregnates the vanquished and establishes kingdoms overseen by the children of these marriages and unions. Great leaders wish to sustain their victories and intermarriage with the defeated nations and tribes may have indeed been Alexander's strategy. Certainly he followed this strategy with this marriage to Roxannas. But if this was truly the case then why was Alexander also compelled to follow a path of discovery to the ends of the known world, particularly in demonstrating that beyond India is the origin of the Nile which, if followed, would bring him and his troops back to the Mediterranean Sea. The speeches delivered by Alexander to his troops wavered in theme from appealing to their desire for conquest and treasure, to that of becoming rules of these new vanquished worlds, to that of discovering the Nile beyond India which will lead them to their homes. Eventually all the arguments fail and he must return or risk total mutiny.

The homosexuality of Alexander is presented in an interesting manner in the film. Alexander seems to have a permanent emotional attachment to his childhood friend Hephaestus but is sexually drawn to the Persian slave boy that becomes his lover. In the first half of the film he asks Hephaestus to sleep with him but he gradually transitions to the Persian slave boy without losing his attachment to Hephaestus as his most honest and trusted companion. His attachment to his wife seems to be one whereby he wished to create a dynasty among the people he conquered. Maybe the film reflects the truth that it is rare that any human relationship will meet all needs.

The film is visually stunning, as beautiful as any Biblical or Ancient world epic produced in the last 40 years. Yet the narrative sequence is too jolting, bouncing back and forth in time too often. The film would have been further strengthened by a chronological presentation and the inclusion of Alexander's conquest of Greece and Egypt to give a full presentation of the size of this young man's military achievements.",1196035200,,3211,5.0

Angelina Jolie howver is brilliant as his witch Queen mother, beauiful, seductive and full of feminine wiles whilst Val Kilmer gives a great performance as the doomed father of Alexander who does not see his son's worth.
There are some great battle scenes, fabulous scenary, stunning costumes, and all in all the cast gel together to make it a watchable movie for the older members in your family.

2310247,3,B0009PLLN6,"This third video release of Oliver Stone's epic about Alexander the Great not only adds 40 minutes of new footage but radically restructures the film.  There is a lot more jumping back and forth in time, tied together by Anthony Hopkins's narration.  The two big battle scenes have been moved close to the beginning and the ending, bookending the rest of the picture.  To some extent, this revision of the narrative improves the picture, but ultimately, this is still a coffee table movie.

Watching Alexander on Blu-Ray is nothing short of breathtaking.  It's stunning how much effort went into the set decoration, makeup, costumes, and overall production design, and all of that work makes for a visual feast in high-definition.  The scene of Alexander entering Babylon, for example, bursts off the screen with vivid, crisp colors, creating a genuine sense of another time and place.  Photography is spectacular throughout, from the battle scenes to sweeping mountain and jungle shots.

None of this makes up for the muddled script and incoherent characterizations that hobble the picture.  One long rambling scene after another features Colin Farrell as Alexander speechifying to swelling music.  Farrell seems to be shouting, screaming, or crying in almost every scene, a poster child for scenery-chewing.  No doubt this is what Oliver Stone asked him to do, but he lacks a certain three-dimensional quality.  We never understand much about Alexander and his motivations.  Jared Leto, as Alexander's closest friend Hephaiston, is a much stronger screen presence; even Anthony Hopkins's narration is more involving.

At 214 minutes, this requires some patience to get through, although it's never exactly boring, just slow-moving.  If you didn't like the theatrical release or the slightly shorter Director's Cut, it's unlikely you'll like this new version more.  If you were a fan of the original, however, this is worth a look, especially if you can see it in high definition.  Even some coffee table books are worth buying just to look at.",1195084800,11,2045,5.204892966360856
2310248,3,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone was not kidding when he mentioned that Alexander The Great's life might be too complicated for dramatization, which explains why it has taken the controversial director three seperate cuts to finally settle on a version of his ""Alexander"" that he claims he's comfortable with. ""Alexander"" still stands as one of the most curious flops of recent years. Its release was preceded by a whole year of hype and anticipation as Stone, the director of brilliant, engaging films like ""JFK"" and ""Platoon,"" was setting his sights on ancient history, many suspected his decision to tackle Alexander's life and invasion of the East as a sort of statement on Bush's current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The production itself was an epic struggle, just read historian Robin Lane Fox's book ""The Making Of Alexander"" (Fox was also the film's historical consultant). When the film premiered in November 2004, it was immediately bashed and ridiculed as a bizarre, muddled homoerotic swords and sandles flick (although it was a hit overseas). Now after two DVD releases, including a Director's Cut that was shorter than the original, comes ""Alexander Revisited,"" which is Stone's attempt at taking the movie and molding it into something more akin to the grand epics of old Hollywood, with modern sex and gore. The result is indeed a more focused, less confusing storyline on a grander scale. Stone has literally re-edited the movie, different takes are used, and certain scenes mixed around. Shots of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy speaking that were originally at the end of the movie are now at the beginning, and this time the movie skips over Alexander's youth at the beginning and uses the epic battle of Gaugamela as a springboard into the character's life. Some expanded material is a lot of fun to watch, especially the scene where Alexander (Colin Farrell) first sees the Bactrian princess Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dancing during a feast, here the scene is longer, with some great choreography. And yes, there is more sex and violence. The battle scenes include some wicked moments of gore, consider the battle in India where now we have a shot of an elephant's foot crashing down on a doomed Greek skull. Alexander's homosexual side is more evident here as well with new material between him and the Persian eunuch Bogoas. The film does still have some merits, especially the beautiful cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Babel, Frida), the music by Vangelis (Blade Runner), and some stunning production design and costume design credits. But no matter how much Stone slices and dices his movie, there some problems editing simply cannot fix, like performances. Colin Farrell is simply a bad Alexander, he does not have the drive, the brilliant madness, or captivating air for a Greek philosopher king who conquered the known world and spread Hellenism, and his balance of Alexander's strong warrior angle with his more tender, feminine character is unbalanced and makes for a performance that is sometimes puzzling, most times weird. Angelina Jolie is a good Olympias, she manages to bring fierce energy to her scenes with Farrell while Val Kilmer does a great King Philip (Alexander's father), Anthony Hopkins as always is notable eventhough he just walks around and narrates. But the movie still suffers from a confusion of what it wants to say, or WHAT it wants to say. Most of the story is still told through voice-over work, and we never get a good look or sense of what exactly Alexander was doing or achieving as he raided all these countries. We know he spread Hellenism and Greek culture, because we read it during history class in high school, but Stone never SHOWS it, instead we get scenes of argument and dialogue that can lead nowhere. The movie can chug along at moments, and great characters like Roxane are wasted and never used as they should. Jared Leto is also a terrible Hephaiston and his over-done use of eye-liner is peculiar. In the end, ""Alexander Revisited"" is an interesting study in the re-editing and assembly of a feature film, but it also shows that there are certain things you simply cannot fix in the editing lab.",1194566400,2,4153,4.976978417266187
2310249,1,B0009PLLN6,"No one I know likes this film. With good reason. Colin Farrell as Alexander is a hopelessly miscast neurotic imbecile. Nothing like the vicious and virtuous and God-like ambitious Alexander the Great. $300. Is that what this mess really cost? No, when these types of big budget movies work, like Gladiator, they are great. When they fail, they leave one almighty trail of waste that leaves the viewer thinking - why?

Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother! Give us a break - she looks younger than he does in the film.

An overblown campfest that leaves a very poor taste.",1194393600,3,571,4.757575757575758
2310250,4,B0009PLLN6,"the movie asks a number of serious questions about the nature of leadership.
What makes a man like Alexander? What drives him? Why do men follow him?

It offers several potential answers.
He listened to the stories and believed in his own destiny and greatness.
He was driven to succeed, to rule, to conquer.
He was lucky, surrounded by good men, who fought hard, bravely and loyally for him.

It talks about vision, his vision of a unified world, with great cities of Alexander like jewels in a crown, the centerpieces of a new kind of world.
It talks about heroics, and stupidity and drunkeness. Loss and long standing love, a manipulating yet wise mother, a loving yet distant father. All the elements that go into the creation of a man and later elaborated into stories and new mythos used to shape the following generations.

It is interesting to have the format of the story-line being the memories of an old man, about his younger days and the things he did and saw 40 years before.
It consists of flashbacks and a roughly chronologically strung together narrative about how Alexander became Alexander the Great.
As an old man, he has seen the consequences of these actions that he narrates, With this advantage point of time, we are afforded more than a chronicle of battles and journeys, we are given the events partly digested and interpreted. What it means to die without an heir apparent, what the drunken rage really costs, why luxury eats at the soul of warriors. Why the men didn't share his vision and how that allows the empire to disintegrate immediately after his death.

It is these kinds of big themes that make movies and books about amazing men like Alexander so interesting and thought provoking. The movie with it's extraordinary battle scenes supplies something more than what a text can do. It gives this emotional umph, this feeling that you somehow share in the adventures, that it is more than imaginative projection, it is a shared experience. And the movie achieves much of this by it's simply overwhelming scale. I could and have read about the battle of Gaugamela, but the movie makes it real in a way that my imagination in reading a book is deficient, for that i am grateful to Stone for the visuals and the historicity of his scenes.

But the movie leaves me with an overwhelming sadness for all those that seem to have to die for a great man's vision. What is it about people that make the glory and carnage on a battlefield so allurging that movies can be made 2 millennium later? What don't prophets or merchants or diplomats cause our blood to run hot and for us to jump into the gap? Why is it that war unites people in destruction and bloodletting? Certainly it can lead to empire, to greater things than tribalism and unending petty border skirmishes, but so can other ways of unifying people behind a complex and significant vision of the ways things ought to be. Why is it that there seems to be no alternatives to men such as Alexander, or Genghis Khan, or Mohammed or even Stalin and Mao and Hitler in the 20thC. Unifiers, visionaries, empire builders, great men who inspire their followers to do amazing things. Why can't all this energy be called forth and sustained in the name and vision of peace?

Why is it that so much energy is created and channelled by war and conquest, by the Alexander's of our history? and so little by the same basic ideas without the destructiveness of war? why can't we seem to fight for peace and justice and freedom with the same valour and self sacrifice that these men fought for gold and glory? Why is it that great ideals don't inspire us to great deeds as well as these ignoble passions?",1194220800,,3674,4.6186830015313936
2310251,4,B0009PLLN6,"Although I prefer this incarnation to the previous two that Oliver Stone produced, I am still disappointed that so much of Alexander's conquest has been simply ignored...and we're talking about historical feats such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, the sack of Tyre, the battle of Issus and his pilgrimage to the oracle in Egypt - all of which are critical to the career of Alexander. It's hard to believe that Oliver Stone thought these events were not worth the time. All in all, however, it's a much better edit that the previous two.",1192924800,2,540,4.6947368421052635
2310252,3,B0009PLLN6,"Judging from the reviews, one would think this was one of the worst movies of all time.  Far from it.  Though is certainly has its weak points, this is an entertaining and well-done movie about one of history's most fascinating characters, Alexander the Great.

First, the good stuff.  The film is lavishly shot, with beautiful recreations of Babylon and Alexandria, Egypt.  It appears many of the scenes were shot on location.  The battle scenes are much better than some reviewers suggest.  The reason that the battle at Issis is confusing is that it was fought in the desert and the dust that was kicked up turned visibility to near-zero.  The other battle scenes are extremely good.  The film is generally historically accurate, at least for Hollywood standards.

The negatives?  Poor acting by all involved.  Colin Farrel does not cut it as Alexander, though he has moments of excellence, such as Alexander's speech to his revolting army in India.  Angelina Jolie is awful as Olympias, Alexander's conniving mother.  Val Kilmer's Phillip is also over-the-top and ends up being a caricature that fails to address Phillip's complexity as a human being.  The bisexual love interests of Alexander are covered so delicately at times that it appears Stone was aware that too much overt sexuality would destroy the film at the box office.  At other times, Stone seems to forget this and several scenes are downright disturbing, although to be fair, at least these are probably accurate.

For sweep, grandeur, and an overall picture of the life of a complex and amazing man, this is a good film.  Not great, but certainly good and a cut above most of the garbage Hollywood puts out any more.  I applaud Oliver Stone for making the effort to make a truly epic movie about a historical figure.  Compare this film to crap like 'Forty-Year Old Virgin' or 'Knocked Up', which got generally good reviews, and maybe it's the reviewers who messed up, not 'Alexander'.

It is certainly worth picking up for the low price it has plunged to.  You can buy a new copy most anywhere for five to ten bucks.

2310255,5,B0009PLLN6,"I saw Alexander back in theaters in 2004, and I instantly thought of it as a classic. However I can understand why most people would dislike this film, this film requires the viewers to actually think. It does not spoon feed viewers like other epics. This new Revisited Cut however largely in my opinion makes the film better and more `complete'. Four hours long, the film could `battle-fatigue' most viewers, but in the end, it is worth it in my opinion especially since it is in HD now. The battle scenes are even more incredible than before. The plot in my opinion is also easier to follow filling in the gaps that were left from the theatrical and director's cut. The most important thing about this new cut is the beginning sequence which is the Battle of Gaugemela which shows the viewer first that Alexander is a king, after the battle it moves into his boyhood life and continues on. Overall, this is a great film and is a must own for HD-DVD (Also available on Blu-ray and SD-DVD) owners who would like to show off their player's capabilities. This two disc HD-DVD set is loaded with extras including a documentary by Sean Stone (Oliver Stone's son) and also splits the movie in two segments with an intermission at the two hour mark on the first disc. If you have not seen Alexander Revisited, I recommend you buy it if you like epics or rent it to be on the safe side, but overall I doubt you will be disappointed.",1192233600,9,1425,4.484615384615385

Alexander revisited is probably one of the best logically structured films that have ever been made so far of this magnitude where dialogue and imagery create a perfect marriage to convey the filmmaker's vision this is an extremely personal experience where stone is trying to peer into the psyche of this complex and sometimes incomprehensible historical figure

First of all the premise that Alexander's mother Olympias is a barbarian with a foreign accent makes him somehow an outsider therefore more empathetic towards non Greek barbarians which gives him the potential to reevaluate and overlook Aristotle's views on the inferiority of the oriental races and their civilizations by taking a Persian eunuch as a lover an Asian wife and by assimilating the Persians into his Macedonian Greek army his genius resides in this transformation from an imperialist general to a man who looks beyond the boundaries of race colour and civilization which doesn't sit well with his Macedonian kinsmen who act no different from any other imperialists in history

Yet interestingly he follows Aristotle's teachings on masculine love to a fault when he distinguishes between the corrupt destructive lustful love which leads eventually to the downfall of man and the pure excellent chaste love the impetus for building civilization hence the chaste embraces with hephaistion.",1191369600,,1566,5.383673469387755

With it's historic storyline, gorgeous sets and costumes, and raw performances ""Alexander"" is a diamond in the rough. The ""diamond"" being the historic epic itself and the ""rough"" being the asinine critics, that have berated the movie from day one.  Colin Farrell's take on ""Alexander"" may have some movie goers wishing for a more dynamic action star, such as Tom Cruise, Hugh Jackman, or maybe even the new James Bond, Daniel Craig?  I, for one, could not have been more pleased than to see Colin Farrell taking on this grandiose role and delivering such a heartfelt performance.  The scenes with Alexander's mother, played wonderfully by exotic beauty Angelina Jolie, were cleverly done by leaving the viewer wondering just what was going on inside this Barbarian Queen's mind.  Val Kilmer surprised me totally in the role of Alexander's father, and did a good job as the savage Macedonian King.

With ""Alexander"" the viewer receives: Award winning actor, Anthony Hopkins, giving the narrative, monumental sets and exotic locales, fine cast performances, and a historic tale of Ancient Rome that captivates the viewer with it's twists and turns. So, why does SO MANY film goers bash ""Alexander?""  I believe I discovered the movie's core dislike while discussing it with various people. The issue that came up again and again, was- ""I can't believe a man like Alexander The Great was sexually attracted to other men,"" and  ""The scenes with Alexander kissing and going to bed with other guys should've been cut,"" or ""It would've been MUCH better, had he not been portrayed as some kind of a gay guy.""  So, there I had uncovered ""Alexander's"" thorn.  These ""movie goers"" had went to see, or bought the DVD, for ""Alexander"" the historic adventurer and King who had a wife and a child, not ""Alexander"" the historic adventurer and King, who had a wife and child, but also several male lovers! Leave it to Oliver Stone to ""tell it like it is"" and get in trouble for it! Bravo!!

The DVD is excellent with an enjoyable introduction by Oliver Stone, the newly ""revised"" and equally entertaining new ""director's cut"" of the movie, including an `""intermission"" at the end of Disc 1.  I found the movie excelled in it's story telling and all the performers were cast perfectly. Again, love it or hate it, ""Alexander"" will one day prevail as a historic epic masterpiece, as did Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra,"" which in its day was hailed a  ""major disaster,"" but is now a much loved movie (with somewhat of a ""camp"" following) recounting the days of Queens and Pharaohs.  For those who are reading this review, and have not seen ""Alexander,"" I recommend this ""new director's cut,"" and for those who have seen it and still disregard it as ""overblown Hollywood fodder,"" I say, ""to each his own.""

2310263,3,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.

Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.

The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.

Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.

On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points.

I laugh at the critics who just love to use words such as BI and GAY at any chance they get, whether it's for their own namesake or out of spite. They love to focus on that sole aspect as if it were the only thing he stood for! Ha!

You actually think hundreds of thousands upon thousands of armies comprised of legions would have followed him to the edge of the world if they thought of him as just a Bi? Alexander was a Soldier's Soldier just as he was a King.

You want to know the truth about Alexander, read the books, read the Greek manuscripts, go visit or learn about the lands where Alexander and the legions travelled and changed life over there forever even to this day. Take a trip to an ancient museam in the Greek State of Makedonia/Macedonia/Macedon in Northern Greece. A GREAT Documentary/TV-Series comes to mind, History Channel's In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great which depicts almost every battle, region, etc.

Learn how some of the Ancient Wonders of the World were constructed in this time period.

I'm pretty sure Alexander was WAY more into Women than he was, if at all, into anything else. All that massive wine they drank, especially in the places over where the Ancient Greek God Dinonysys travelled as well as Herakles during his time with the Twelve Labors (or Hercules as he is most referred to), must have added to the Drama and possibly even affected campaigns.

At the Height of it's extent, The Greek Empire spanned a total of almost 25 modern day countries.

The regions and peoples are beautifully depicted in the Tv-Series: Footsteps of Alexander the Great.

I haven't seen the director's cut yet, the 2 disc special edition is my favorite but the Revisited edition is a must see for It's extra footage which is pretty good for the most part.

The music score by Composer Vangelis (Blade Runner, 1492 Conquest..) is just fantastic to say the least!

2310268,3,B0009PLLN6,"I'm a huge fan of Oliver Stone and I've seen the both the original and final cut version of his epic Alexander. I am only here to comment on the music. I have a prejudice against electronic or synthesized soundtracks for movies set in antiquity, and this is what spoiled Alexander for me - I couldn't get passed the music. I feel that the movie would have been far more successful with a soundtrack using natural instruments and the themes of Vangelis. I know that Stone loves Vangelis and so do others; but for me, I was pulled out of this ancient time in history by the artificial electronic sounds. They weren't powerful enough or heroic enough for my taste, and I tend to like Vangelis in other films. I would have much prefered a John Williams soundtrack if he'd been available, and I think the movie would have been far more successful. The soundtrack sets the tone for the entire movie, oftentimes in subtle or subconscious ways, and for me the music was unable to sufficiently support the largeness of Alexander's life events or the totality of his life as a whole. I expect no one to agree with me here, but I love the largeness of scope in what Stone attempts and I'd like to see him succeed according to the incredible efforts he makes in his films. And believe me, this was a monumental film, and I love that he gave it his all.

2310269,4,B0009PLLN6,"In my reviewing this third version of ""Alexander,"" it is difficult for me not to contrast the results of Stone's efforts with what might have been had HBO carried through with their proposal to create a ten-part series about Alexander based upon Mary Renault's trilogy ""Fire From Heaven,"" ""The Persian Boy,"" and ""Funeral Games,"" assuming that the producers would have chosen excellent script writers, directors, and actors.  Such a docudrama, run chronologically, would have had a far better chance of covering the almost 33 years of Alexander's life in a more complete and presentable manner.  Stone obviously struggeled in his attempt to produce a hybred docudrama / entertainment film that could fit into a single sitting at a movie theater. In all three versions of his film, he met with varying degrees of success or failure.

Still, Stone's production is better (the good parts are far better than many people were capable of recognizing) than many critics and too many audience members thought.  There are reasons for this.

Over the years, I have conducted extensive research on Alexander.  Also, my having worked as a mental-health therapist for nearly 30 years, I once engaged it what might be called a ""forensic psychological analysis"" of Alexander and came to some interesting conclusions.  So I have been able to compare and contrast the film with the film industry's ""preferred approach"" to script writing, directing, and production as described to me by my friend who is a university instructor in film.

The second version ""Director's Cut"" was an improvement over the initial theater version.  This final version has some further improvements yet suffers from the same, inevitable difficulties of the first two.

In an effort to integrate the divers elements of the film into an organic whole, Stone made the choice to move frequently forward or backward in time.  A multi-part docudrama, run chronologically, would have been far easier for most of the public to follow.  Some critics complained about the addition of narration throughout the film, a possibly cumbersome element for an entertainment film.  The additional information was a necessary addition, however, considering the limited length of the film and also the limited historical knowledge of most movie goers.

The docudrama elements of Stone's film are historically accurate.  Yet in his attempt to make an entertainment film, Stone engaged in compression of, and skewing of, events, especially in the later battle parts of the film.  Those in the audience who prefer dramatic action to fact may have been more pleased; however, those members who were capable of appreciating the historically accurate parts of the film may have been a little uncomfortable with this conflict between the two approaches.

In ""Alexander - Revisited,"" Stone finally was free to include additional dialogue and scene extensions that never should have been omitted in the first two versions, undoubtedly against Stone's wishes.  The pressure on Stone to omit these segments apparently was worry about the film being ""too talky"" and also, frankly, from ignorance and prejudice.  A therapist must attempt to promote acceptance of fact and reality over beliefs that not only defy fact and reality but also have the potential to be harmful.  One of my patients was very upset and angry (along with many viewers and even some Greeks, who should know better) that Stone ""forced upon the viewing public a false, made-up version of Alexander's sexual orientation.""  Stone's portrayal of Alexander and Hepheastion's life-long relationship is accurate, and their expressions of love for each other are done with taste and sensitivity.  I have not read from those persons who were offended by the gentle kiss between Bagoas and Alexander in this third version any comments about the overtly sexual scene with Alexander and Roxanne in all three versions.  Stone, therefore, should be commended for including the scenes with Alexander and Hepheastion and also the additional footage of Bagoas.

I own and have watched all three DVD versions of Stone's film.  The second defintely is better than the first.  Although I need to view the second and third versions more in order to come to a more detailed comparison, the additional film footage in ""Alexander - Revisited"" may tip the evaluation scales in its favor, despite the somewhat disjointed feeling resulting from its editing.",1179705600,11,4428,5.21015514809591
2310270,1,B0009PLLN6,"Its one of the worst historical based movie I have ever seen. The implication that Alexander was a homosexual or bisexual does not cut it in terms of Macedonian society of the time period. There were strong friendships between men, which persist today, that have no sexual connotations. As a matter of fact men who dressed, painted themselves and acted as women were shunned by society and made fun of from Assirya in the east to Carthage in the west. The actress chosen for the part of Roxanne has no physical characteristics similar to her historical predecesor, except maybe her great body. But maybe casting a more ravishing woman in that part would have downgraded the supposedly homosexual relationship that Alexander is shown to have. The only good casting made was that of Alexander`s mother. I do not want to rehash other areas of criticism except to say that this is not a movie about Alexander The Great but rather of Alexander The Gay.

Maybe the director`s next movie will be making Richard The Lionhearted into Richard The Gayhearted, in which case he would again be sadly mistaken.",1179273600,9,1096,4.829787234042553
2310271,5,B0009PLLN6,"I've been a Greek history fan for years, especially Alexander - and this final verison of the movie filled in - what to me - were gaping holes.

Mind you, I'm well aware it's not all historically accurate - but it definitely had a lot more of Bagoas.  I was upset the original release did not show his importance in Alexander's life - and that the 'Director's Cut' cut him even further.  No doubt, in a vain attempt to satisfy the homophobes...

I was very amused at the chief eunuch's attempts to show Alexander how well he was cut.  And the ending when Alexander told him how valuable he'd been.  And Ptolemy's comment that he disappeared after Alexander's death.

Freeing the entire harem was not something Alexander would do, but expressing his love definitely was.

Still disappointed there was no love scene - either with Hephaistion or Bagoas - that might equal a scene from 'Queer as Folk' - but thought this final version captured the essence of the love they shared.

2310272,3,B0009PLLN6,"To believe many of the critics, professionals and movie mavens alike, Alexander is one of the worst movies ever made.  It is not.  In fact, it is quite good...in spots.

The film drags a bit.  The story line moves back and forth in time, alternating between Alexander as king and conqueror and as son/heir apparent to Phillip.  Some like that device.  I, personally, feel that it is overused, somewhat cliche.

The characters are well developed.  Colin Ferrell and the rest of the cast did admirable work.  The battle scenes are enjoyable but sometimes confusing (particularly the battle at Guagamela) and few and far between.

Post Braveheart, movies about ""great"" men tend to deify them, tend to thrust upon the virtues or values of our civilization.  It was a bit hard to swallow that Alexander wanted conquer the then known world, not for riches, the spoils of war or the glory of conquest, but to free slaves and spread Greek civilization to the ""heathens.""  This much is suggested by Alexander in the film, a position that seems to starkly contrast berating of his generals for viewing Asians as an inferior civilization/people.

There is a lot of information packed in the story.  One of the side benefits of a film like this is that it causes history lovers (like me) to learn the ""true"" story about Alexander, his family, his enemies, etc.

Much is made about the bi-sexuality exhibited.  Anyone that has even a cursory knowledge of ancient history knows or has heard that Greek men were lovers of other men and kept women as wives and mothers.  I certainly don't proclaim to be an expert on the subject, but it seemed that the ""men"" or ""boys"" to which Alexander and his generals were attracted were extremely effeminate, almost drag queens.  I understand that Greek men loved men precisely because they were men, not because they looked like flat-chested women.  It is a rather minor point, but since the sexual themes in the film seem never to be ignored, it is worth discussion.

Overall, it is a good film.  It's by no means great.  I wouldn't purchase Alexander, but it's worth a rental.",1178668800,3,2101,4.761772853185596

2310274,5,B0009PLLN6,"When the original theatrical version of ""Alexander"" had been released internationally, I was living in Germany and had seen it presented in the local Kino.  What initially attracted me to go see the movie (at the time, I was a junior in high school) was the fact there was a widespread release that involved the telling of Alexander in his true bisexual nature.

But what I hadn't expected was that the film would be utterly brilliant, that it would move me in many ways - and not a bit of that was because of the bisexuality.  Since that initial show, I had gone back a second time to see it at the theatre, bought both the theatrical and director's cut releases in 2005, and now bought the final cut in 2007.

Each telling is a different intrepretation of the material at hand, and all are truly magnificant.  But it's this final cut that is the best, for it's sheer redefinition of epic from root to petal.  It brings SO much to the table, and the intermission in the middle is JUST what's needed, what's perfect for it.

I thought the performances by all the actors were great, and I appreciated the more in-depth back story of every single character, what makes them become who they are in the end.  It was so intriguing in so many ways.

So yeah, check it out! haha",1178496000,22,1271,4.420600858369099

2310276,4,B0009PLLN6,"Before I begin, I should first state that most of the imperfections that existed before this edition was released are still present.  But that when all's said and done, this is the only cut that should have survived a triple-dip of DVD releases.  The fact that in his introduction, Oliver Stone asks us to 'enjoy every sublime and awkward pixel', leads us to reason that this still isn't the final product he had in mind, but this is as good as it's ever going to get.

I always said that Alexander deserved to be given the ""Rome"" treatment, and that even at under 4 hours, it should have been longer.  Like Alexander, Oliver Stone's reach exceded his grasp, but not many other filmmakers would have had the chutzpah to try.

The biggest problem this movie faced was its erratic casting.  Physically, Colin Farrell a shining gem of a leading man, but he's yet to prove he's much more than a pretty boy, possessing neither the charisma nor the acting chops to pull this role off (but it doesn't help that he's saddled down with some ham-handed lines).

I give him credit however, for not many major actors in the world would have kissed another man onscreen for fear of being either being typecast or made to look like a fool.

Much has been made of Angelina Jolie's ""ridiculous"" accent, and I agree that it's jarring, not to mention ridiculous--Stone had Farrell speak in his own Irish brogue, so why ask Jolie to sound like a modern day Irene Papas?  Neither she nor co-star Val Kilmer as King Phillip need any acting lessons, but both seem like they'd phoned in their parts.

No such excuses for Jared Leto, who's only role seems to be to look worried and glance longingly at Alexander from time to time when we need reminding about sexual ambiguity.

Another complaint is the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy the Elder as a narrator, claiming that the use of a narrator is proof of bad writing (the idea that you need a narrator implies that the story needs to be explained to you), and generally that's a valid complaint, but in this movie, I think the use of narration adds to the gravitas--otherwise it's just another Colin Farrell flick.",1178409600,20,2151,4.604712041884817
2310277,4,B0009PLLN6,"having read all the reviews about how bad this film is I didn't expect much when I finally got round to watching it.  Thing is, the film is not all that bad at all.  I can remember when this film was being made the complaints coming from Greece because Alexander was shown as bisexual (I can only assume those Greeks who were complaining must be living in denial about their history) Its kind of sad that this aspect was 'toned down' to make it more 'acceptable' What was equally odd were the complaints from Iran because the film showed flied buzzing around the heads of Persian soldiers, some of them wearing Turbans (yeah OK that is annoying considering it isn't an Iranian head dress and this is supposed to be a historical epic) but most daft of all where the complaints that the film showed Iran (or Persia) in a bad light.

Come on now, first of all this is a film.  Now are you seriously trying to tell me that there are not films made in Iran showing victories of historical Persian armies over their enemies?  All cultures have their own history and their own conception of history.

Now on with the film.  First off everyone will have a complaint about this film as it is impossible to chronicle Alexanders entire life in a few hours of cinema what the director here has done is attempt to capture some of the most important aspects of it and in this I think he has done a fairly good job.

The greatness of the Persian empire and its capital, the warlike Greeks, the strange cultures that Alexanders men met on their journey east, the battle scenes are well directed (especially those in India) the whole hedonistic culture of the ancient world also is well captured.  Perhaps there could have been a better choice of actors for some of the roles (Alexander for example) and not entirely sure about Angelina Jolie in this role (not too sure about her in any role for that matter, wasn't too bad in Gia though)

Still, think the critics were a little too harsh.  Watch it a couple of times and it will grow on you.",1177632000,23,2025,4.445945945945946
2310278,5,B0009PLLN6,"I was impressed when I first saw Alexander on the screen.  This was before I was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman history.  Then re-seeing it, I fell in love with it, original theatrical cut.  The Director's cut was okay, but not better than the original.

I recently recognized the flaws which detracted some people from it, such as lack of characterization of some of the minor characters, a seeming characterization of Alexander based on his flaws rather than his greatness, and so on.  However, I don't think this is enough to detract my intense love for the movie.

I think Oliver Stone is a cinematic genius, and it shows in his work like Platoon and Natural Born Killers.  The direction is brilliant, and the incredible detail put into cinematography, costumes, and sets is simply epic on its own scale.

The Battle of Gaugamela sequence is pure brilliance, and I believe the most accurate ancient battle portrayal in all Hollywood.  Aside from occasional lapses in which a Phalanx is broken apart, men fight in formation, rather than wandering around the field on their own, picking on-on-one ""The Mummy Returns"" style battles.

The acting is perhaps some of the best I've ever seen.  Colin Farrel dissolves so fully into his role, that it's impossible for me to see the man playing Alexander as the man who played a slick New York agent in ""Phone Booth"", or a deadpan bald villain with a raspy voice in ""Daredevil"".  Val Kilmer so fully becomes Philip of Macedon that you can't see him doing any other role.  He's no longer Val Kilmer underneath the scarred eyelid and thick beard, he's Philippos II of Makedon.

The lesser-known actors, Jared Leto who plays Hephaistion, Gary Stretch who plays Cleitus the Black, and all the others playing the likes of Crateros, young Ptolemaios, Nearkhos, they are so fluid in their roles that they could quite possibly be the actual characters they portray, Irish and British accents and all.

The ""Clash with Cleitus"" scene is so thickly potent with chemistry between Farrel and Stretch (Cleitus) that it sends shivers through my spine listening to how these two rail at each other, and how literate, yet scathing and understandable Cleitus is.  His vocabulary is like poetry, like Sophokles' writing, and yet his message is so simple and human that it's universally understood, even if you don't speak the language.

Inaccuracies aside (they had to cut and condense scenes for time, including a simplification of the Battle of Hydaspes, which Stone himself acknowledges, due to the vast complexity of the actual battle), it's one of the more accurate Hollywood movies about Ancient Greece, and an epic in its own right.  Love it or hate it, it IS an epic.

The Final Cut expands upon it even more, and re-arranges scenes so that the lead-up to the Battle of Gaugamela comes first, after the scene of his death and Ptolemaios (Ptolemy)'s brief introduction.  Scene re-sorting aside, new scenes show a more benevolent Alexander, working to bring Phoenicians in to build Babylon's shallow water harbor, granting gifts to his friends and soldiers, freeing Darius's harem slaves and eunuchs, granting great honors on his conquered enemies, including a scene with Oxyhartes(sp), father of Roxane.  Important scenes, such as the clash with Cleitus, are expanded with more dialogue, more action before and after scenes to provide a more solid foundation for the coming events, and such, adding more depth to some, and more reasoning to others.

The Final Cut doesn't radically change the movie, but it solidifies some shaky foundations, and fixes some, but not all, of the flaws with the original cut.  The subplot with Cassander and Roxane, mentioned by Stone in the original commentary, is missing, as is the conflict with Cleitus and Hephaistion.",1177027200,23,3794,4.977812995245642

Alexander leads a huge uninspired army that wants to go home.  And all he does for much of the movie is force them to keep going.  At some point, I could no longer sympathize with him.

to the nature of Alexander. Reading other reviews I have come to the conclusion that most individuals have read little or nothing about Alexander the Great.  Oliver Stone has taken some poetic license in his movie as is to be expected. It is still entertaining even for someone who has read quite a bit about Alexander.",1176076800,3,395,4.7101449275362315
2310283,4,B0009PLLN6,"After watching the movie and reading quite a bit of reviews. I decided I wanted to write my own. Just to let my ideas and my fustration out with my unanswerable question of ""why"" this film was so badly put down by many.

I neither gave it a 5 stars ""GREAT!"" review nor a 1 star ""Mess of a movie"" but I am leaning more towards the good.

I'll just start off with the bad. I've read many reviews complaining about the cast. Some say they love Angelina Jolie and hate Colin Ferrel. Other's say the exact opposite. Some even bashed Anthony Hopkins as being boring. I think it's more of the opinion of which is your favorite actor, from most of the reviews I've read. I didn't think Colin Ferrel was a great Alexander. Good, yes, I think he certainly gave it his all, but not great. At certain points of the film he was lacking, like his speech at the Gaugemela battle, which could have been cut short. I wanted to get on with the battle scene. I was not very fond with Jolie's Russian accent, but I wasn't as bothered by it as some people. But I did like her sorceress ways and her pet snakes. And I really didn't understand why people were tearing out Hopkins and his role. I thought he gave a good and honest performance of an old Ptolemy recollecting the past.

The conclusion I came to this was that Oliver Stone went overboard with the star studded cast. To me there was just one big celebrity clashing with the other. I felt all of them were going to implode because they were all trying to top each other on their performances.

The music score could have been better for a big film such as this. I didn't find much diversity in the music, it seem the same as you hear it throughout the film. I would've liked it to be dramatically different as Alexander goes from one country to the next.

The Good: It was visually stunning! The set designs, costumes, etc. were all excellent. Despite all the bad reviews I would still like it just because of the visuals. The designs for the Babylon palace are amazing. It makes me think of Alexander as a fool for not wanting to go back to the palace in Babylon and stay there for the rest of his life. The costumes were all culturally diverse from one region to the next.

I also found the battle scenes great and exciting. I don't believe the reviews that say the battle scenes are a mess. I thought it was more believable that a battle would be so chaotic that its hard to tell who's who or which is which. A real battle is not nicely  choreographed! I never thought it was confusing when I was watching it, for one thing there were subtitles telling you which flank you're watching and you get what the army is trying to do.

As for historical accuracy, there are many who criticize films for being historically inaccurate. Alexander is not one of those films. It tries to be as historically accurate as it can be, given what we're to guess as how Alexander's life was. And Alexander was more accurate then other films it was compared to like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. Though I do like these films, they were grossly inaccurate. A gladiator didn't kill emperor Commodus in the arena. Lucilla did not outlive her brother. Balian was NOT a blacksmith, nor was his father Godfrey. And Balian never had an affair with Sibylla. As for Alexander, at least the main facts are straight. He did have a mother named Olympia and a father named Phillip. He did marry a girl named Roxane. He did become king at a young age and led a strong campaign to conquer the known world. And he died the time he did with the same incident as history has told us, from a fever. The movie also incorporates some of the debate that historians have to his death, example: poisoned, over drinking, etc. which I found interesting.

As for the flow of the story. Many complained that there is no clear answer of Alexander in the movie. Well of course it wouldn't have a very clear point. Nobody really knew what Alexander was like, save all but a few stories, and cryptic texts. Another things is the movie is narrated by Ptolemy, Alexander's general and not by Alexander. Ptolemy didn't know all of the facts of Alexander's life, the movie showed this. He told to the best of his ability at what he perceive Alexander to be.

I also found the dialoged engaging. I didn't mind it. I'm not really the type to have fight scenes left and right and all over the movie. People don't fight 24/7. It takes more then a few lines to explain what Alexander's motives are, his relationship with his friends, family, peers, and his dreams of a united world. Understandably there should be a bit of talking.

All in all, it was a good movie. I found it to be more emotionally driven then Troy and more or less passion as it would have like Gladiator. Know that this review is for Alexander REVISITED. I never saw the theatrical version or the first director's cut. Maybe it was those other versions that people were put off by. From this final cut maybe people would like it more. I found it to be enjoyable and I gave my most honest opinion about it.

2310284,4,B0009PLLN6,"An excellent biopic about the conqueror.  Gorgeous to look at and very accurate in most respects.  Oliver Stone explores a lot of the inner motivation of Alexander and his relationship to his parents.  Because Alexander is primarily known for his talents as a general there should have been a lot more about his conquest of the Persian Empire.  In addition, the relationship between Alexander and the love of his life, Hephaestion, was not very fully explored while concentrating a lot more on Alexander's marriage to a barbarian princess which was primarily a marriage of convenience.

2310287,4,B0009PLLN6,"There aren't too many epic filmakers these days, and just about all of them court controversy at some point in their careers. Oliver Stone is just that kind of a man. From ""JFK"" to the recent ""World Trade Center,"" he is not afraid to make decisions that will rankle people. Such is the case with his glorious mess, ""Alexander."" Everything about this movie is so right that the total failure of the film to connect can only lie on Stone's shoulders.

Colin Farrell plays Alexander as a troubled Mama's boy. The much debated 'gay content' is limited to googely-eyes shared between Farrell and Jared Leto (the hottest sex scene is when Rosario Dawson and Farrell get it on). Everyone - from Farrell to Val Kilmer, speaks as if Macedonia was Northern Ireland. Except Angelina Jolie, who plays Alexander's mother like she just left a gig doing Natasha voice overs for ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoons. Kilmer, by the way, is nothing short of brilliant as King Phillip. I didn't even recognize him at first, he is so enveloped in the role.

The filming itself is rich, lush, beautiful. So what does Stone do with it? Everyone stands up and makes speeches. Over and over, people talk on and on through scenes that go way beyond their need. Anthony Hopkin's voice overs give the film a much needed narrative connectivity, yet Hopkins himself barely appears. When he DOES show up, it is to pontificate like he's onstage at some Shakespearian production.

The battle scenes are mammoth, chaotic, splendid. That is, unless you want to have any indication of who is fighting who. Then, all the thrown dust and swirling camera work leave you guessing. Same with the bizarrely intercut timelines. You will have several WTF moments as you try to figure out not just the what, but the when an activity is taking place. Be patient and you will be rewarded with the spectacle of Alexander's final battle in India, with charging elephants and stunning scenery.

When comparing ""Alexander"" to ""Troy"" or ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" Stone's movie falls somewhere between the two. ""Alexander"" is more an accurate portrayal of Alexander than ""Troy's"" bungling of Homer's Iliad, (at least Stone didn't flinch away from bi-sexuality they way Wolfgang Peterson did with Achilles in ""Troy""), but Troy never felt like it was dragging in pace. One the other hand, Colin Farell and the cast of ""Alexander"" are far more convincing than ""Kingdom Of Heaven,"" even if I believe Ridley Scott managed to craft the more watchable movie.

It's too bad that all this amazing work is left floundering in chaos, becuase ""Alexander"" had all the making of a brilliant movie. It is so ambitious that I can't help but add the fourth star, but I suspect that a few more edits might have made this a more choherent movie. We all know Oliver Stone has it in him, after all, he made a movie that was mostly two hours of men buried in rubble fascinating. Why ""Alexander"" seems like it was left as rubble mystefies me.",1175385600,43,2958,4.76953125
2310288,4,B0009PLLN6,"Having admired the initial theatrical cut i was disappointed with the directors cut released on DVD. To me this appeared to be a sell out by Oliver Stone to appease the negative reaction this film received on release and try and win over more people with extended battles and less homosexual overtones. The directors cut played out badly and missed important backstory and character development shown in the original version. Hearing a final uncut, full length version was to be released i purchased hoping Oliver had had a rethink and restored his film to its greater glory. Well i can happily say he did and more. This is the cut which despite its 3.5 hour running time should have been released at the beginning. Alexander and his relationships have been given greater attention here and it helps the audience gain a greater understanding of this flawed but valiant person.  The battle scenes have been extended and include some new graphic additions (a person being squashed to a pulp by an elephant being a memorable one) really adding to the scope and brutality of warfare. Colin Farrell does a great job however i felt Val Kilmer to be slightly weak and unbelievable.  Overall this is a fine film which makes a noble attempt at capturing the essence of one of history's most revered and mysterious figures. The elephant battle scene is one of the best ever committed to film. Oliver Stone confirmed he wanted to make a film like the old greats (Ben Hur) with the same large canas and epic vision. Whilst he has succeeded i cannot forgive him for taking three goes to get it right. I would of thought someone as gifted as him wouldn't have needed to do this and is very lucky Warner Bros have given him another chance.  I have not heard of anyone being this lucky before. Nevertheless i highly recommend this film for history buffs and battle fans who should rejoice in the fantastic canvas on display here.

Alexander the great is an epic wonderfull emotional visual masterpiece.

It developed so to say from the very first dvd release which - in fact - wasn't perfect to a now really great film.

In fact the irony is that people may not yet realize that this is a milestone, a true epic. A film which will be remebered.

You have to think in bigger dimensons if you want to judge this film.

This film is a portrait of a man who changed the world -  created by our generation with the best tools availible.

 Therefore it is naturaly the best KIND of art we can ( visually ) create nowadays.

The actual skill of the filmmaker doesn't really matter because in this dimension skill is obligatory.

The only thing which diverses audience is taste - which is relativly and therefore secondary.

This is just a very basic philosophic thougt which some of you may not understand but it is important to be aware of this before you even accroach to judge a picture like this.

The film tells the story of a man, a hero, a god.

It shows us exotic locations which consort with fantastic music. It shows as great actors.

The wonderfull thing is that it tells about a time whenn there were true heros. Wehen the world wasn't discoverd yet, whenn there were great unknown regions, whenn true battles were fought and true victorys won.

A time which i in fact miss verry much.

Look at our world today. There are no more heroes anymore. No visionairs. Our world has become a big busines center, nature is destroyed, there are no more white spaces on the map there is no MAGIC left in this world!

This film shows the magic. The magic of true beauty of true new worlds of true herous.

That is just one reason why i think this film is a masterpiece.

Additional Things:

About the critics.

Critics are paid to critisize. It's an all returing circulation: Whenn there is a history film critics first of all critic the non existing accuary of the film. They are paid for it an it is ok to remind the naive population that there's real history behind the film.

As for the more intelligent and educated people or at least the people who know what films are for: Screw the critics.

Film is entertainment. Total history accuracy is not only utopian but would actually destroy a movie. So screw the critics or just laugh at them. Or as in my case: I don't read critics as all. I know whenn i see a good or a bad film: I don't need someone to tell me.

Allright, i'm a bit tired now, signing of.

It had all the major scenes from the theaterical release, and it had the same timeline as the director's cut. Anything I disliked was personal. So if you liked the previous movies, then I think you will like this one as well.",1174780800,28,303,4.428571428571429

2310293,1,B0009PLLN6,"For a 2 DVD set advertised as a ""Collector's Edition"", I don't think caveat emptor really applies.  I have a right to expect commentaries.  (None included.) I have a right to expect a ""Making Of"". (None included).  I have a right to expect some additional decent extras other than the single, very LAME, short intro by someone who appears under the influence of serious anti-depressants.  (Who, by the way, somehow reminds me of Bob Guccione, in his EXTRA FEATURE, who felt obligated to justify his vision of Caligula and did a much finer job of it.)

I get blank DVD's for 50 cents.  I'm sure these folks get a better price in their quantities.

What a rip-off.  Do they expect me to buy one of the non-revisited earlier ""Collector's Editions"" to get the extras? This is truly a rip-off.

I recommend that you don't buy any of them until the real collector's edition of the final cut comes out in a 4 DVD set.  I'm going to send mine back.

2310294,5,B0009PLLN6,"I originally sat on the fence in my opinion of the theatre release of Alexander, but Alexander Revisited has won me over as admirer of the film. The new cut has a truly epic feel and the leading characters are portrayed with more breadth and depth. In particular, the climactic crises of Alexander's career are conveyed more intelligibly and convincingly than before. I am the author of both academic articles and non-fiction books on Alexander, so I feel I should comment particularly on the historical accuracy of the film. In my opinion Alexander Revisited is notably honest, daring and sincere in its pursuit of historical accuracy. Although Oliver has deliberately conflated events which actually occurred at different times and places into single scenes (I think he had to in order to tell the whole story in a single film), almost everything has some kind of historical basis in the group of 2000 year old accounts, which provide most of our knowledge of Alexander. For example, such details as Cleitus severing the arm of a Persian about to strike Alexander, the incident with the monkeys in India and Alexander's visit to the wounded after the battle are all in the sources. Even that eagle is mentioned by Curtius. Furthermore, many snippets of dialogue are based on words actually said to have been spoken by Alexander: e.g. ""He too is Alexander"", ""So would I if I were Parmenion"", ""It is a lovely thing to live with courage..."" Great attention to historical detail was also paid to the costumes and scenery. Babylon was particularly good - the ziggurat, the flowers and the caged big cats were all really there when Alexander drove into the city in a chariot. Overall, Alexander Revisited gives a more authentic sense of the real history than any other film about the ancient world that I can think of. Gladiator was a great film, but its greatness owed more to Marvel comic strip principles of action and violence than to its setting in ancient Rome. Alexander Revisited is a great film because it tells one of the most compelling human stories in all of history with faithfulness, drama and pathos.",1173571200,269,2112,4.853185595567867
2310295,5,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's third try at revising his biopic of Alexander the Great has been a success.  The story line is now much clearer and cleaner.  The film brings us much closer to the man and his military successes.  Though the story of Alexander the Great will never clearly separate the myth from the man because of the extensive passage of time and the loss of physical evidence including the destruction of written contemporary history about the man and his accomplishments which were stored in the tragically burnt down Library of Alexandria in Egypt, I felt that this final revisit of this film by Oliver Stone has brought us closer to the essence of the man who was hailed as ""Megas Alexandros"".  It is my hope that this version will stand out as the version which will recognize Stone's fine effort to present the great conqueror's life and story.  I encourage others to take the time to look at this new version of the Alexander film.",1173312000,47,938,4.66060606060606

2310297,3,B0009PLLN6,"This is a terribly constructed and executed movie. I mean it should be used in film schools as demonstrative evidence of how not to make a movie.

The narrative is a mess, the timeline jumps forwards, backwards and sideways without explanation or reason. It was so convoluted and nonsensical that it became comically bad. Some movies have used non-linear timelines effectively - this is not one of them.

The acting is, by in large, disappointing. Colin Farrell is in way over his head, Angelina Jolie's transylvanian accent and charicature-like acting is technically ridiculous but she is entertaining despite herself. J.Leto is a nonfactor. Val Kilmer is pretty adequate.

There are countless instances of horrible technical & artistic missteps through every single moment of this movie. You will laugh alot and this is not a comedy.

In spite of all this I still enjoyed this movie - alot more than I should have. For starters, the story of Alexander is so compelling that even a bad movie about his life is still entertaining. The best part of this movie was the visuals - which were done well. I have always wondered what Babylon might have looked like, what King Darius and the Persion armies looked like setting up ranks in the desert. The war elephants in India were really, for lack of a better word, cool. It was so fun to see images of these great locations, armies, men and events that I have always wondered about. So in this specific respect, the movie is worth watching. Just enjoy the images and don't expect much!",1172620800,4,1530,4.784090909090909
2310298,5,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's Alexander Revisited is now something of a masterwork. He is given the chance to tell the story as he would have originally liked to have presented it. The 45 minutes of extra's are true extra's...spread out in short 2 to 5 second edits...to more lengthly exchanges that happily include Brian Blessed as the Physical Instructor, Christopher Plummer as Aristotle and quite a bit more voice over and character addition from Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy.

  The action starts almost immediately with a longer, more graphic version of the Battle of Gaugemela (Wonderfully undertaken, Stone paying homage to the great Sergei Bondarchuk with those terrific panning shots) and then works backwards through Alexanders youth. The film moves forward and backwards from there yet the new subtitles give you the year and how long, before or after, from the previous scene. It is quite instructive to anyone the slighest bit confused and is a superb history lesson. Also good are longer dancing scenes with Roxanna's troupe and Bogoas' troupe...both superb, filmic scenes...beautifully done. The Bogoas character (Francisco Bosch) is also expanded and made far more sympathetic.

  The Indian Battle (wonderfully filmed in Thailand) is also more graphic as are some of the more intimate scenes yet nothing is without merit. This is not 2007, it's 330BC and mores and the concept of battle, honor, fidelity etc were different for those times. I for one, praise Mr. Stone for a very accurate feel and presence...and even minor characters are explained in far greater detail...such as the young Guardsman who killed Philip (Kilmer)...in a flashback we see his motives. It is now far more beautifully edited...from a master filmaker who values editing, JFK gets my vote as the best edited film of all time.

  I am giving it 5 Stars...a masterpiece. Do watch the Stone introduction, he says it better than I...""If you liked the original you'll love this, if you hated the original you'll hate this even more!"" Now there is a man!

  The only part I am saddened about is that over the end titles Vangelis' epic piece 'Titans' is still only 2 minutes long...yet it fits the edit...and I would urge you to purchase the CD for the complete 4 minute version...one of the best pieces of film music I felt ever written.",1172620800,231,2316,4.987012987012987

Some of the fight scenes are neat and the way Oliver Stone shows the beautiful architecture of Babylon is breath taking.  The rest of the film is poor though.  I know from reading history books about Alexander that he had an interesting relationship with hi mother.  The bad thing is that his mother in the film is Angelina Jolie, who is to close in age to Farrel to be believable.  Well Colin Farrel plays Alexander and he is about as interesting as watching pizza on a table succumb to mold.  The movie was so much about Alexander having talks with his mom.  Again, the battle scenes are very big and bold but this film was way to long, and in between the scenes that showed how this guy almost ruled the whole planet, are long, drawn out scenes of dialogue behind closed doors that I did not find added much.  Just out of control in that department, I mean they could have cut it down some and allowed some of these dramatic moments inside the castle walls to add to the film.

The studio behind Alexander's release, in an attempt to try and salvage something, had Oliver Stone cut 40 minutes from the DVD release the first time around. Guess what? Didn't work! People still thought it sucked!

Whether those 40 minutes are in there or not, Alexander is stiil the same total & utter failure that it is. Don't waste your money on this stuff, folks.

The movie was biased more towards making sure every one knew that homosexuality existed in the ranks than it was with portraying historical accuracy and detail.  It was more a political statement enforcing the mass acceptance of this practice in the modern world.  The fact is that there is no ancient document that clearly attests that this was  the way of things (at least in the ""universal"" degree portrayed in this film), therefore to included it so heavily in this film is an attempt to bias history in an unwarranted fashion.  Unprofessional and unsuccessful, a sad reflection of our times - demoralized and disintegrating into darkness.",1170633600,10,774,4.833333333333333
2310304,4,B0009PLLN6,"This movie may be a failure, but as one character says of Alexander - `His failure towered over other peoples successes!'  This directors cut is actually a little shorter than the theatrical cut, and the changes are not obvious unless you do a study of the two or someone has told you what they are - but they work.  The directors cut somehow flows better than its theatrical cousin, and does not seem quite such hard work, making it worthy of re-appraisal.

However, it is still overripe - the last third of the movie showing the destruction of that which Alexander loved - His horse, his best friend / lover Haphaestion, his army, his health and most of all his dream of one nation - just somehow seem at odds with the rest of the movie, and make for an unsatisfying narrative arc.  Of course, these are just the facts of history that Oliver Stone had to work with, but you can't help wondering if the rival Alexander project of Baz Luhrmann which was scrapped when Stones vision was going to reach screens first, might have been more successful - focussing as it did on just a portion of Alexander's life.  Alexander had too rich a story perhaps to fit into one movie.  The rise of Alexander has more than enough for one epic, and the fall of Alexander is a story in itself - but to fit it all into one movie smacks of the kind of desire to outdo the competition that sank Cleopatra.

So what works and what doesn't.  Stone is a genius film maker, and this movie is amazingly shot and has imaginative ideas throughout.  Occasionally these are a little overbearing, such as the reverse colour used when Alexander is injured, but on the whole they succeed - the eagle flying from Alexander talking to his soldiers across the battlefield to the waiting Persians is wonderful (if somewhat poor cgi).  The device of splicing the dual narratives of Alexander's young life with his life as the general making his conquests, is ideal - a straight chronological tale would have been just too dull - especially with the later parts in India being just so depressing.  The cast is veritably star studded, in a modern way, and the supporting cast are uniformly excellent.  Angelina Jolie makes a memorable, sexy but scary Olympias making her perfect casting - except for THAT accent which was a big mistake and quickly becomes tedious.  IN fact, what was it with accents in this movie?  Farrel has an Irish accent that is impossible to hide, but does Val Kilmer have to echo it, and Jared Leto too, as if to say the ancient Greeks were actually an Irish dynasty?  The other major woman in Alexander's life is also a big success, Rosario Dawson playing the exotic barbarian woman who became his wife, but she is under utilised.  Opinions will vary as to how good Farrel was, but in spite of the accent, I think his was a great performance showing the intended emotion, vulnerability and indeed ego of the complicated young man.

The music by Vangelis is a masterful piece of music - buy the album by all means - I did.  However, as a score to a movie, it has mixed success... sometimes it is just too distracting  - in epic moments of grandeur it is magnificent - but in battle scenes just tries too hard and does not sit well.  Perhaps it might have worked in someone elses movie of Alexander, but not Stone's.

In short, this movie will frustrate you with its length, with its rushing through parts of Alexander's life, and lack of a satisfying narrative arc.  But it is a movie made with great care, by some of the best in the business, and deserves re-appraisal in this director's cut form.",1170547200,31,3584,4.532608695652174

If this movie was to take place in Greece (Macedon), why was everyone speaking with British or Irish accents? Speaking of accents, Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson had the worse fake accents I had ever heard. You would think they would've done some research on the accents of Mediterreanean/Middle Eastern women. That would've been much better than hearing awful Russian accents. And why not have an older actress play Olympia? Angelina Jolie playing  Olympia, Alexander's mother, was totally unbelievable since Angelina and Colin Farrell are roughly around the same age. The war scene in the beginning of the movie was confusing to watch. There was so much dust everywhere that it was hard to tell who was fighting who. The other war scene, which took place in India, was the only time the movie got exciting. By that time the movie was almost over. I don't know much about Alexander the Great, but if you rely on Hollywood for your history what you'll get from this movie is that Alexander is an overemotional mama's boy, who likes boys, and wants to ""conquer"" the known world to bring freedom to everyone.

2310311,5,B0009PLLN6,"The problem this film ran into is that we are now experienceing a second maybe third generation who are almost completely ignorant of the ancient Classics which were once taught in most schools along with the ""three r's.""

So if you've never been exposed to them you don't understand why they are important.  I'll tell you why:  The Classics teach you about life and leadership.  They keep you from being a sheepish follower.  You are taught to be an innovative thinker- that is prized above all.

Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" assumes you know this:  That Alexander was schooled in Homeric tradition and slept with a copy of ""The Iliad"" under

his pillow.  That Alexander used the concepts he learned in his life's work.  Like Achilles he would rather live a short life with glory throughout the ages.  Bear in mind that Alexander's funeral train was

twenty six miles long and travelled eighteen months throughout his provinces to his final resting place.  Along the route were crowds to bid him farewell in an ancient world without mass communication!!!

Oliver Stone succeeded.  His modern audience is just too lazy.

Spoonfeed them the inaccurate ""Troy""- I swear Jennifer Annistan should have dropped Brad Pitt just because he was in that piece of junk.  Good

Greek girl that she is.

Oliver's Stone's ""Alexander"" should be the stepping off point for anyone

willing to be introduced to the ancient world.  After all we're just repeating all this stuff anyway.

I think many of the people who wrote negative reviews don't understand the complex story of Alexander.

Also, Alexander was depicted accurately  leading to his rise and fall of conquering the world. I almost think the negative critics wanted complete action throughout the movie like Troy.

2310313,1,B0009PLLN6,"""First of all before I get to my review, let me say this movie is absolute garbage.  There should be a prison were directors who make ridiculous and absurd biographical movies should have to watch ""Ishtar"" everday at least 10 times a day as punishment.""  Having said that, on with the review.

Since we really don't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of Alexander, we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him. We know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident, but trying to put together a portrait of his ""true"" character and nature is at best just hypothetical conjecture. No one knows who Alexander really was as a person. Most people don't even know themselves.

Does this movie convey Alexander as he really was or just some Hollywood director's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biographies of Alexander. From the ridiculous Harold Lamb version to the account of Arrian to the excellent ""The Generalship of Alexander the Great"" by Major General J.F.C. Fuller (which if you want to seriously learn something about Alexander, you should read) there isn't much that can be added to what scant information we have. Certainly the life of Alexander is a mystery since there is virtually nothing known about it, and what little is know wasn't even included in the film.

For example, his leading the cavalry charge at the ""Battle of Chaeronea"" which resulted in Philip's hegemony of Greece wasn't ever mentioned in the movie. Instead, sensual garbage including his mother's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him, in the usual Hollywood manner, is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer.

Obviously, his mother had an influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children, but ""give me a break"". This kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what Alexander did in his life, which is what made him ""The Great"".

Almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless. And a lot of what is mentioned isn't even correct. And many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork, and bad guesswork at that.

Another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering: At the age 16 Alexander was entrusted with the regency of Macedonia while Philip was sieging Perinthos and Byzantium in eastern Thrace. While his father was gone, the Maedi, a Thracian tribe, revolted. Alexander led a campaign against them, succeeded, and established a new colony at Maedi and named it Alexandros. He was also allowed to be referred to as a ""man"" after that, because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and that was the only way a Macadonian could be considered a ""man"".

At that time Alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field. It was possible to comprehend his father's harsh, disciplined life which included drinking, hunting, and loving.

The rest of Alexander's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at Maedi, but the movie, in my opinion, just doesn't do justice to Alexander. A man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better. And quite frankly, except for the poorly done battle scenes, I've seen more action in ""Road Runner"" cartoons.

One final example which wasn't even hinted at in the movie: On his march back ""home"", he encountered the ""Mallians"", a fierce and warring nation. An assault was made on their major stronghold, and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving. Alexander, with his impatience to storm the fortress, grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up. Three other men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him. The men on the ground scrambled to follow Alexander, and their combined weight broke the ladder, and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements. The men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety, but Alexander jumped into the fort and attacked. He received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the Mallians. The army broke into the stronghold, and thinking Alexander dead, killed everyone there. That's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of, not some jickjack Jollie snake juggling mishmash of psychological meanderings that were a complete bore.

Alexander was a man of action, a great leader and general, a genius of military strategy and tactics, a philosopher, musician, had schooling in botany, astronomy, medicine, geography, and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the ""grand tradition"". Maybe Peter Jackson should make a movie about Alexander. I'm sure he could get it ""right"".",1163808000,16,5005,4.83411214953271

2310315,4,B0009PLLN6,"'Alexander' has proven that Oliver Stone hasn't lost his touch at making excellent movies. The acting in the movie is fantastic. Even though Colin and some of the others aren't Greek, the cast is still perfect. I love biographical films and this is one of the best I have seen dealing with the subject of ancient times.

This film has been given so many negative reviews that it didn't deserve. 'Alexander' is definitely excellent compared to some movies that Hollywood has been putting out recently. The scenery to the story itself is beautiful. There are moments that are truly breath-taking. The visuals of the film are complemented with the music score that really does set the mood for the film and matches the scenes perfectly. 'Alexander', in it's entirety, is definitely something to see.",1161302400,22,796,4.940298507462686
2310316,2,B0009PLLN6,"This movie is so bad that I turned it off after about an hour.  The photography is excellent, the costumes are outstanding, the writing poor, the editing worse, and the director should be prosecuted for malpractice.  I have read several biographies of Alexander and this movie seemed to select various episodes and tie them together like a series of vignettes.  It then switches back and forth between his youth and his maturity to the point that there is no continuity and it is almost impossible to follow what is going on.  It ignores that Alexander was widely believed to be a party to his father's assassination.

The casting for this film left a lot to be desired and grime and grit seemed to used in place of actual acting. The writing didn't help and Alexander came across as reciting lines that he didn't understand and certainly didn't feel.  It is really too bad that this film is so bad, because with the money spent it could have been a good adventure film.  Instead we got a mishmash.  Don't bother seeing this film.",1157155200,8,1030,4.6208791208791204

Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal.  There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life.  Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much.  I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie.  They are the redeeming features of the whole thing.  But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue.  Read a good book about it!!

2310318,4,B0009PLLN6,"Stone's 'Alexander' has probably become more of a semi-obsession for myself than any other film of the past few years, and even though I'm not entirely convinced it's a GREAT film, I will stubbornly defend it -- or perhaps, reasonably express my admiration -- when criticism comes a'knockin'.

Reading so many comments on the film here and other places, some things boggle my mind. For starters -- the acting. How anyone could dare say the overall acting of the picture is bad is beyond me. Personally, I was not disappointed with any of the actors. And, truly, I think that as one watches the film more than once, they have more of an appreciation for the nuance captured within many of the characters. Jolie's character is a perfect example -- initially it's difficult to stomach her bizzare accent and seemingly over-the-top portrayal of Olympias, but after a few watches, it seems disrespectful and almost naive in dismissing her whole performance as merely 'ham-fisted' (that said, one thing that I still believe would have worked better is to cast an older actress for the part giving a more realistic age seperation with Alexander and his mother). It's these type of superficial first impressions that I think lend the film so much of its tremendously negative reputation.

Now, here is where I transition from forgiving to spiteful lambast at those who forsake the film with ludicrous, hateful spewings of unintelligence (and again, this is of course not all that dislike the film). In a day when few big-budgeted Hollywood films prove to be anything more than narcissistic, sophomoric celluloid, an ambitious, trying project like 'Alexander' comes along and gets cut to pieces. To me, 'so' few films capture the passionate energy that 'Alexander' possesses. 'So' few... Really. While there are definitely problems amidst its entirety, I have a hard time imagining some of the scenes in the film don't leave some viewers breathless. For example, the taut, confrontational bits (Alexander with Philip in Macedonia; Alexander with Cleitus in India) are some of the most expertly directed and acted I've seen in many a year. Remarkably edited and scored, with a raw verve that rarely comes about in a picture of this type, I can't help but be impressed each time these particular scenes come up. Perhaps even more arresting moments come from the battle sequences. The battle scenes, to me, are admirable first and foremost for the amount of detail shown within each shot, which proves to be an endlessly impressive feat that Stone ruthlessly strives for through the film (in and out of blood ridden chaos). Where so many epics are satisfied with visually zoning in on more focused matters (a technique that works to great effect when properly used), as to perhaps confine finances, 'Alexander' is always displaying its huge, wondrous and interesting Universe, which for me makes the film epic beyond epic. And yet, this sort of macro-vision makes for a restraint that allows the more intimite moments to capture that much more drama. As Alexander leaps on his horse and manically lurches after King Darius near the conclusion of the film's first battle sequence, Stone employs a cliche slow-motion effect that transcends its stereotype because the technique is withheld for some fifteen odd minutes up until that point. Courtesy a striking cue by Vangelis -- who's score is utterly invaluable to the theatrics herein -- what would appear hackneyed in lesser hands comes off as rousing in Stone's assertion. It's these widespread moments of artistry and cinematic virtue that make 'Alexander' what it is for me.

Where 'Alexander' faults more than anything I think is within its narrative, but again more viewings really evoke the sense of scale here -- it's SUCH a big film, with so much ambition, that it almost eats its own tail. Like most of my favorite films, one sitting just isn't enough, and even if you find yourself with complete distaste initially, chances are you would find at least some things to admire if you gave it another try, or at minimum respect it for its drive and aspirations. Furthermore the political subtext here doesn't seem to be that profound, and truthfully I take the film merely as a fictional account of a historical figure, while taking its historical accuracy with but a grain of salt (perhaps I am wrong in doing this, but I am no expert on the subject and care not to read the endless amounts of information, then attempting to decide what's 'right'). In this light, I believe it allows oneself to get past the debatably undeniable fact that Farrell's Alexander really isn't the type of leader any of us would have imagined (then again, he was so young -- I don't know how I could even conjure up a realistic character of such an age who conquered the known world). Even so, this is basically the bottom line for me: I really do love this film for its utter passion by near everyone involved, but if I had to write a seven page essay on the elements of the film I had quarrels with, I could. But as with my experience, when you love something with all of your heart, you are that much more forgiving when its inevitable flaws are exposed. Such is the case with me and 'Alexander'.",1155945600,33,5223,4.853139013452915
2310319,4,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone, along with Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese,and Stephen Speilberg, are arguably the most prolific maintream hollywood directors of the last quarter century. This doesn't mean they are not, at times, controversial, and Stone is probably the most controversial. JFK, Nixon, are like Alexander,

somehat fictionalizedc historical films. Moreover, in Alexander

Stone attempts to resurrect a lost breed (mostly from the mid 50's to the mid 60's- the apogee of American unquestioned power and imperialism) the historical epic. The epic, according to literary theorists, is often an attempt to give an almost divine

right to imperial escapades.

In this film, Stone offers an Epical blueprint (the probably closest relative is The Gladiator)  of the rise and fall of empires. Anthony Hopkins, as narrator and Ptolmey, uses the term Orientalist is his description of Alexander's quest. Orientalism, of those who have read Edward Said's brilliant work of the same name, is the the slanted-imperialist attitude of Europe- and later the US- in viewing people from unfamiar cultures as inferior, sexual and violent heathens, and conquerable for their own good. This attitude which reached it's zenith in highly imperialitic 19th century Europe, and is an underlying attitude- and justification- for the US's current middle eastern preemptive and dehuhamizing aggressive policies.

The movie, itslf, is worth the time. The Macedonian flashbacks  seem to take away from the building tension of the movie. It's good that Oliver is re-editing it. I would prefer Jolie as Alexamder's wife, Roxanna, rather than his mother. Firth, himself,is pretty good as Alexander but seems a bit too frail and introspective- but his ""humane"" proto-imperialistic/paternalistitic vision seems on the mark, and distinguishes him, and the movie. Also, their failure to defeat India and older and more evolved culture bespeaks of the limits of Empire- and Orientalism. However, I would have preferred a little more wisdom imparted from Alexander's teacher- and one of the world's greatest philosphers, Aristotle. But, perhaps, that's my own preference. This is not a European art film, nor does it intend to be.

One does not need to see this picture as conceptually and critically as I do to enjoy it, but to realize that there are many parallels in Alexander's quest to modern meglomaiac ventures does help one see this as a more cohesive and meaningful effort. Stone, the big picture histoical and cultural critic does it again; but the movie does still need a little tweeking.",1155254400,28,2556,5.340796019900497

2310322,2,B0009PLLN6,"When this Oliver Stone's epic was released, critics had slaughtered it and terrible reviews were broadcast on TV and newspaper articles. After seeing this film, i'm not surprised of the terrible reviews that Alexander recieved. Yes, it is a very bad film but its not completely useless. There are SOME interesting set pieces and uses of CGI and two fairly exciting battles, but it is the structure, pace and acting that destroys this film. The film starts off when Alexander is young, showing us how he grows up from the words of (non)wisdom from his mother and the strict discipline from his drunken father to his adult days becoming king after his fathers death and finally commanding the Maceadonian army. All of this is shown, but in the wrong way. Flashbacks pop up in different places and the first slow then extremely fast pace just seems to ruin the films essential structure.

Although the presentation of the story is bad, its the acting thats worse. Supporting actors have a mix of Irish, British and Scottish accents while Colin Farrell (Alexander) has a very strong Dublin accent and Angelina Jolie (Alexanders mother) strangely aquires a Transylvanian vampire type accent. This does appear silly as they are all supposed to be Greek. A lot of the acting from all parties are exaggerated, as Angelina Jolie over acts and Colin Farrell with his over-the-top dramatization of everything just looks ridiculous on screen.

Alexander does have its moments, but not a lot of very good ones. The pace, structure, poor acting and terrible direction of this lenghty film is what brings it down. And somehow this film does not entirely show us how great Alexander was. From reading the Greek historical documents on the true Alexander the Great, I can see how he was a great and powerful man.

2310325,2,B0009PLLN6,"Before I begin my review, I would like to say that I have studied the life and accomplishments of Alexander the Great in depth, and am aware of the historical facts of his life. Therefore, I believe I am judging this film fairly.

""Alexander"" is a stab at a great movie, but falls short. It is no easy thing to create a movie about Alexander's life. Even though he died young, his life was packed with more events than most men that live to be old. This presents a problem of the length of the film, which was too long. It could not have been much shorter, but I think things should have been added that were missing, and other things that were unnecessary taken out.

There are too many long seens of slow dialogue, most of which is useless. The exchanges between Alexander and Hephaistion were not done well, in my opinion, and the viewer didn't really feel that they were great companions.

The acting in this film was well done. Despite what other may say, Angelina Jolie played a great Olympias, not overdoing the sense of poisonous pride and need for vengeance against Phillip through Alexander's glory. This aspect of the film, the relationship between Alexander and Olympias, was a memorable one. However, most of the key players in Alexander's life- (Hephaistion, Parmenion, Bagoas, etc.) were either miscasted or simply poorely presented.

Two other great performances were Val Kilmer as the deranged and troubled Phillip, and Rosario Dawson as Roxanne.

The role of Alexander himself was surely a difficult one to fill, and when considering the relative dauntingness of this part, Colin Farrell played the part very well.

Anthony Hopkins was a wonderful Ptolemy, but was not given good enough lines to perform. He seemed to go on about so many different things that the viewer lost attention. He wasn't given much room to prove himself in this movie.

First, I will outline the aspects of the film that direly needed improvement. The slow motion battle sequences were downright absurd at times, particularly the sequence against the war elephants in India in which Bucephelus is killed and Alexander wounded. The cinematography was not as artsy as it should have been, as befitting such an epic. Darius and the Persians were poorly depicted as cowards and evil dictators.

This movie began wonderfully, then wasted away, much as Alexander's career did. The beginning was wonderful, with Alexander as an inquisitve and troubled child. Scenes such as the fight between Olympias and Phillip in the bedroom with Alexander hidden under the sheets, and the taming of Bucephelus were excellent. However, once he leaves Pella, the movie skips many key points in his life and moves right to Guagemala, his key victory over the Persian Empire. Several wonderful events are overlooked and brushed aside: Alexander's visit to the ruins of Troy, The Battle of Issus, the Siege of Tyre, Alexander's travels in Egypt, including to the Oracle of Ammon at Siwa, and crowning as Pharaoh in Memphis.

The battle of Guagemela is mediocre. The movie's special effects were not wonderful, and the battle sequences needed editing and innovate ways to make the battles more interesting.

The best parts of this movie, in my opinion, are the beautiful sets and visual recreations, especially of the city of Babylon. The sets of Pella were lavish and darkly beautiful. The reconstructions of Alexandria where Old Ptolemy sits and dictates his history of Alexander's life were breathtaking, as was Ptolemy's palace, and the extravagant and mighty streets and collonades of old Babylon. However, as soon as Alexander leaves Babylon, the movie begins to disintegrate.

Quickly, this film, like Alexander's life, turns into one nightmarish event after another; conspiracies, famines, mutiny, exhaustion, personal loss, disease, low morale, and ruthless and savage enemies. The movie turns into a long and drawn out nightmare as Alexander gets farther and farther away from the known world.

The battles in India and such were poorly done. The coverage of the revolts against Alexander, conspiracies against him, and the long and miserable journey back West were likewise unenjoyable to watch. The movie unravelled at the seams as soon as they passed beyond their sphere of knowledge, past Persia or anything they knew.

Overall, this movie is not very well done. A great score accompanies the film, but the music, written by Vangelis, was not used to the fullest, and can scarcely be heard.

Actually, this movie was relatively historically accruate throughout, with the exception of a few minor things. (Just to point out an example, in the scenes of Alexandria, the Pharos Lighthouse is shown fully operational and standing tall over the harbor, when in fact it wasn't completed or used until after Ptolemy's death.) It's the little things that knaw at the plot. But, all things considered, it wasn't a classical mythology reworked and contorted to appeal to the general public, which is good. They didn't try to make Alexander your typical Hollywood, heterosexual hero, and showed him as a flawed and troubled man.

But one must considered what a feat it would have been to make a perfect film about Alexander's entire life. It seems impossible. To fit everything in, they would have had to have made a nine hour film. Personally, I think the story would have been served much better should they have made it into several, two or even three, seperate movies, like a trilogy. This way, all of the great events of his life could have been shown and treated with importance. Overall, this movie tried and failed. Watch the first hour or so, then turn it off and imagine that the rest of the movie was treated with the same brilliance and care.

Historical buffs of the beginning of Hellenism and the era of Alexander the Great should give it a view on a rainy day just to see a different interpretation of his life. But don't take it too seriously. For those who don't already know the history behind it, this movie will be extremely confusing and boring to you.

This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33.""

The good: Young Alexander calms and rides wild black stallion Bucephalus; Val Kilmer as Alexander's warrior father Phillip shows the boy cave drawings of Greek myths which presage Alexander's life... Two battles - the first at Gaugamela where young Alexander defeated King Darius and the second - magnificent and spectacular battle of Alexander's army against elephants in India with the unforgettable shot of Alexander on his horse against the huge animal; the surreal atmosphere of the last battle thanks to the color red that dominated the scene as seen through the eyes of the wounded Alexander. Legendary Babylon with its Tower and the hanging Gardens is breathtaking as it is shown in the movie. Angelina Jolie was regal....when her mouth was shut and here I come to the bad and the ridiculous. Who on earth decided that the Queen of the Ancient Macedonia in the 4th Century B.C.) should speak with the most horrible imitation of an Eastern European accent ever on the screen? The scenes between Jolie and Farrell made me laugh - so bizarre and ludicrous they were. Besides, even if I assume that Olimpias had Alexander when she was very young, 15 or 16, she did not change a bit when he was 25, and they looked together like a brother and a sister or two lovers - not like a mother and son. The real problem is that with all the and passion for his project and its subject, Stone could not make his overlong (almost three hours) movie as interesting and convincing as just some of its parts are. I have nothing against non-linear structure - when it works but here it was distracting and confusing - the only way to realize where and when you were was by watching the length of Alexander's hair. As for Farrell in the titular role, he was not bad - he is just not charismatic enough. I could not help thinking of another Alexander the Great project - Baz Luhrman's with Leonardo DiCaprio - who is a better actor and who was incredibly good in the last year's ""The Aviator""... Well, quoting one of my favorite critics, ""the movie has some interesting moments but you can find something better to do with this part of your life.""",1152316800,4,2487,4.691075514874142
2310327,3,B0009PLLN6,"Recently, I purchased this DVD set on sale on a whim at Target because I enjoy ancient history and have seen many films that have depicted this historical period (Ancient Greece and Rome) magnificently or have failed miserably.

I clearly recall the publicity blitz for this movie as well on its initial release on cable channels like American Movie Classics and E! And I also believe that noted historian, Michael Wood, ""In Search of the Trojan War"" and ""In Search of Alexander,"" was an unofficial consultant to the film. So, it should be in pretty good hands, right?  Well, not quite...

On the whole, this film is cinematically opulent despite some of the rather cheap-looking sets (look closely): this basically means it is beautiful to look at. Angelina Jolie gives an understated but serviceable performance as Alexander's mother and Val Kilmer(one-eyed and stumbling about the lavish set) is credible as Phillip of Macedon. Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer (although his appearance is too brief) give this film the added gravitas it so desperately needs.

The battle sequences are well-orchestrated compliments of CGI--perhaps a little too much--but this is what we have come to expect ever since Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" made it's debut. So where does the problem lie?  The casting of the lead, Colin Farrell?  Perhaps, but it really isn't appropriate to place the burden of the film's success or lack of it on his shoulders alone. The problem with this film lies, in my humble opinion, not in Oliver Stone's direction, but in the execution of Alexander's story--there is only so much life one can possibly cram into 167 minutes.  Besides, experience is an excellent teacher, and if Stone's ""JFK"" has taught us anything it's that this director takes liberties with the facts of history.

For those who have studied the classics know that Alexander was an extremely complex individual--and I am not just referring his ambiguous sexual orientation that is clumsily acknowledged in this film--but his motivations, his ideals, and his psyche all need to come to play effectively in order to understand the man. The film seems rushed as if the producer and director agreed to pack everything in and as much as possible. But Stone cannot really pull it off here. Colin Farrell manages what he can with a limited script oftentimes sounding more like an LA thirty-something bellowing to his teammates during a casual weekend pick-up basketball game than ordering his cavalry to check King Darius' left flank!  Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is on my ""must buy"" list, but I have my doubts now after seeing Stone's film.

In all honesty, a picture like this needs an actor of Richard Burton's stature, vocal presence, and strength to pull it off. We all know ""Cleopatra"" was a bloated melodrama, but somehow his presence made even bad films tolerable. Incidentally, the Welsh actor did play Alexander the Great in a 1960's version biopic available on MGM-DVD.

If only Anthony Mann was alive today to repeat the technical and artistic success of his magnificent ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" made over 40 years ago.

I was hoping that a glimpse of Aristotle would be shown in this film.  He was mentioned and my hopes were raised.  But no visuals.  Why is this important?  Because it would have linked this film thematically with the great history of philosophy that had just reached a decline in Greece.  Before Aristotle were Socrates and Plato.  How is is possible to remember the order of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle?  SPA bath.

OK, so we don't all want to learn about the history of the Greek empire simply from watching hollywood films.  We want to read a book, and even better, discuss it over some tea and chocolate with someone who can inform us well.  But I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  The use of stone mosaic maps at reasonably regular intervals to remind us of where Alexander and his armies had progressed to geographically helped me to get my head around what was happening.

The leaps back and forth in time also were well done and helped fill in the story.

It was a shame they had to use Angelina Jolie throughout, rather than an aging mother of Alexander, which would have been more realistic.",1151625600,,1234,4.575342465753424
2310329,1,B0009PLLN6,"The first thing I said after watching Alexander was, `That couldn't have been more of a waste of time!'

For as far as I'm concerned, Alexander wasn't supposed to have a male lover, not even in the original Alexander movie, real life is a more far shot than India to Africa. I don't see the connection between Transylvanian acting and Transylvanian `overacting', I also don't see the so-called reason for Val to try and re-ensemble Fred Flintstone in such an angsty way. Nor do I see a good line to hold together, making Hannibal Lector vomit out the entire story of Alexander, turned into fake rather than what the real Alexander would ever try to do.

To start with a logical explanation, the writer will testify when Stone is sued by Historians that `I was drunk at the time I wrote it' to get off being beaten publicly by the real Alexander movie fans.

A seven-year-old Alexander favorer turned down and ran when he saw this movie, at the exact same time Collin Ferrell lost the `actor' title to Collin Firth. Angelina Jolie hit a new low, turning herself into `conqueror's mother' (now known as Brad Pitt's play-toy: LOWER) rather than `raider of the tombs' and also the place where Val Kilmer's `Batman' movie sprouted wings and left him there to face the coming embarrassment alone.

To say the least, Rosario Dawson's limpy character would've liked to know `where did' her husband go all those nights, yelling `Hephaestion?! Haphaestion?!' To put it bluntly, `He has a `man to man' thing going on'

The costume designer probably needs to get some credit for completely ruining the attires and to hopple down ceramic crosses, blindfolded, with a scissor in hand. Of course, the music director was in midst of cronic filapi when someone from the Lawyer's office was probably ranting on about the Sueage to the mixer who was having a hard time reading the notes. And oh! What an unrealistic set that was! With apple juice mixed with food coloring for whisky and paper-mache for royal fans. Cardboard painted yellow for walls, with the off-beat-unearthly-royal crust furniture? Going with the leafy exterior of plastic flowers and flupes for fountains? Absolutely greatgarbage!

Mouth taped shut, Olly directs with an intensity to battle! Fingers crossed in hope for grand day sale, with the cameramen all confused, running around with blah-blah black sheep following the dark cloud over their head of failed movie.

Testing the dialogues, was the editor, with nothing but a moody Pampers diaper commercial to add to his career (if it's not, it sure seemed like it). Not to mention the `fluffy-flufferson' scene change which left me with corneas. I'd say a great waste of time was just `waiting' for the next scene to start, with my vision not blurred somewhat...

The cast castified, the director mortified, the writer drugified, the crew crucified, this movie came together under big money, and low plot. To see the premiere of such a gollolop movie be so huge and grand, as implying the story will turn out magnificently, makes me want to bang my head against a wall. Repeatedly.

In the name of effects, they forget the story, in the name of big name actors, they forgot the story, in the name of director's eve, they forgot the story. How messed up, you say? That's right!

Saying that cheese and cats don't mix would be perfect to describe Olly and epics. Well, atleast the box office knows better now than to release another one of his 'Legend'O'Ala's.",1151020800,4,3464,4.8263069139966275

I was going to write a review, but instead, if you are considering watching this film, I'd suggest you go over to rottentomatoes and read the large collection of professional reviews.  They pretty much say it all--just a grand, big budget mess of a film.  The serious acting is comical, the plot is pointless, and Angelina, who are you kidding with that ridiculous accent? I think the best review would be by a psychoanalyst trying to psychoanalyze Oliver Stone through this movie. I think there's a lot of frustrated subconscious mucking about in this one. Of course, now that you've heard it's so bad you'll want to watch it just to see how bad it is. Use the fast forward a lot--you'll feel better if you do.

2310331,4,B0009PLLN6,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",1148774400,22,1487,4.6311787072243344
2310332,2,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's Alexander is written for the stage and not for film. In Stone's vision of ancient greece, Aristotle is a senseless bigot, with nothing of merit to say. Young Alexander is a whiny mommas boy. During the few battle scenes, the camera doesnt know what to do. Most of the film takes place in a handful of sets where the Scottish Macedonians and English Greeks gather to dialogue about nothing. The sets are well dressed, but Oliver Stone has no sense for the culture and sensibilities of ancient greece, babylon, or Persia. Instead they are all fairy-tale places where stiff-lipped shakespearean actors (occaisionally painted to look middle eastern), gather to recall bits of dialogue, as best they can, from Henry the Fifth.

  Alexander the man is all sound and fury goading his men to fight on for 'freedom' as they conquer their way across the middle east into India. The only reason that Alexander would say something so stupid is because the movie is not about Alexander. Stone uses the story of an arrogant young man's attempt to counquer asia as an allegory of america (or the West?) and the middle east. Unfortunately this allegory needs to be forced through pointless dialogue and he ends up telling neither alexander's story nor the allegory well.

What is worth seeing then? In all 30 minutes of the film. The CGI of Babylon is great. Oliver Stones vision of Afghanistan and India is mesmerizing. Val Kilmer does a fine performance as the King Phillip of Macedon and Angelina Jolie is the only characeter allowed a greek accent, which she does well 90% of the time.  Also the bosom of Alexander's wife is extraordinary.

But in the end, the movie forsakes historical realism for pseudo-Shakespearean theater, for which Stone is not qualified to write or direct.",1147824000,3,1784,4.871287128712871
2310333,4,B0009PLLN6,"I suggest watching the film with director Oliver Stone's commentary on the film that addresses many of the complaints about his movie, Alexander.

Although a lot of people declare the film as historically inaccurate, those arguments don't seem correct.  Many of the books on Alexander were written two or three generations after Alexander's death, and an educated person has to carefully distinguish probable fact from a legend.  Oliver Stone appears to have done a remarkably good job of weeding through history books to locate the most credible information.  The movie's acute narrative seems to ""cross the grain"" in the wrong direction for many people who decided to object to the movie.  Stone's vision for this movie were based on academic resources.

Why do people have so much trouble enjoying this movie?  That's easy to answer.  Western audiences obviously don't like movies that focus on love stories between men.  This is not to say ""sex"", since the movie is not about sex.  It is about male love.  A few people criticize the movie because its protagonist has a friend so close to him that people mis-understand their relation as homosexual in nature.  As Stone points out on the DVD commentary of his director's cut, history shows no evidence of any sexual involvement between those two people.  So, people don't know that they were sexually involved, even if some would prefer to believe it to simplify the movie plot.  They wince at the act of male physical relations that are not treated as sex and when they are not homosexual.  The reaction of criticizing the movie for these two characters obviously stems from personal bias deriving out of Western pop culture and pseudo-belief that men should not have loving relations, as though pop culture knows what manhood is about.  Since Stone uses Alexander to question these themes about recent Western society, people have seen fit to do lots of jokes about this movie.  If the reason to doubt this movie is for those jokes, then those people misunderstand the movie deliberately, and solely upon their personal convictions already biased.  How can anyone be angry at this movie's choices in its portrayals when the proper questions about the Greek imperialist aristocrats derives in-part out of their psychology, which included sexual acts that do not exclude people on a basis of their sex such as in current Western bias?  Not showing the meaning of that bi-sexuality, where these leaders thought of themselves as gods, they would not be restricted to a single form of sexuality.  This is portrayed in Alexander with a large degree of respect to historical truth.  Stone could've made a movie that blatantly disregards these facts, but lacking this integration, like other movies on Alexander the Great, disregard the function of sexuality and how it affected the historical figure's influence.

He was a smart man, he was a conqueror, he was as homosexual as any Greek aristocrat, HE CRIED AFTER BATTLES IN PLAIN VIEW, and, if you don't like it, screw you.  (What do you know?)

I also don't appreciate the argument that people should not be taught by a movie, since that is specifically why movies are good.  Don't think I don't relate to people who say they don't like to be lectured, but isn't that what makes people smarter?  Isn't that why people go to school, to listen to lectures?  What's wrong with history lessons told through a camera?  Alexander's life is the subject in question.  Should people turn off their intelligence because they go to the cinema to escape instead of to think?  Can't people do both at the same time?",1147824000,22,3603,4.927031509121061

2310335,1,B0009PLLN6,"I saw this movie on vacation with my cousin.  That idiot spent 20 euro on it before he even saw it!  By the end, we were both wishing he could return it.

This movie is so pointless that I can't even describe the plot.  First there are a few random scenes with a young Alexander and his mother.  Then time flashes forward and Alexander is the King of Macedonia.  He fights a war and becomes a bigger king.  The war scene sucked.  There was just a bunch of dust, and everyone was wearing so much armor you couldn't tell who was who.  Not even the baddies from the goodies.  Then you think that the goodies are losing and suddenly the baddies are running away and the goodies win.  Hmm.

The movie then flashes forward to when Alexander the Great is older and he's conquering China and all that.  There's a rebellion and he kills most of his army.  He gets married to a girl and rapes her on their wedding night.  He almost dies when he attacks a giant black elephant, but the men who hated him before now love him.  They take him back to Macedonia and he dies.  Fun.

This movie dragged on so long it was unbearable.  I guess it's only three hours, but it felt like four, at least.  The acting sucks, and most of the ""main characters"" have about fifty lines each.  Even Alexander doesn't do much talking.  Does anyone know if Alexander the Great was actually gay?  It seems like he is b/c he keeps kissing that weird guy whose name is unpronouncaable and starts with an H.  Alexander is supposed to be a hero, but in this movie he's just an ugly loser.  He is dishonorable, disgusting, rude, and just plain inlikeable.

This flick basically is an expensive B-movie.  The acting is bad; the whole affair is very campy. Worse, the movie does not really convey the story of Alexander.  Many of the scenes and facts are taken directly from historical accounts (which may or may not be true).  But the Alexander in this movie doesn't seem much like the blood-thirsty general who was tutored by Aristotle (Hopkins, please retire now).  This is Alexander the Imp, conquering the Near East just to avoid his mother (who, by the way, appears to be the same age as him).  Historians may disagree about many aspects of Alexander's character, but the one thing that is obvious from the historical record: this guy was absolutely ruthless and very intelligent.  None of that comes accross in this movie.  Instead, Alexander is some brooding, conflicted dude wearing a wig.

Normally, I wouldn't have minded the length of the movies.  I sat through Kingdom of Heaven and King Kong.  Time passed quickly but towards the third quarter of Alexander, my concentration started to give way.  I couldn't help but noticing Irish, English, Russian accents spoken as Macedonians.  The battles meant to be the highlight for movies of such proportions but it wasn't executed as successfully as in Kingdom of Heavens and even Troy!  Utlimately, it came to the direction of the movie.  I guess that the planning and execution of it wasn't tackled until the movie started.  Throughout the movie, Alexander tended to fight against his inner demons (with much manipulation by his mother, Olympia versus his father).  I tried to feel for Alexander, the flawed conqueror and yet, I couldn't.  The battles were many and emphasis was never made to let us relate between Alexander and his generals.  Oliver Stone the director painted them as racists and ignorant mercenaries who would fight one another the moment Alexander died.  The only bit that touched my heart would be that insignificant moment between Alexander and his favourite horse which was actually registered in history, the very horse that fought with him all the way to history.  The last quarter was the hardest bit to swallow with arty farty red against white background and pscyhedellic images to the point that it felt out of character with the rest of the movie.  There was much said about emphasis on Alexander's love for his male lover (Jared Leto) here that it 'killed' the movie.  However, the latest offering of Brokeback Mountain doesn't seem to have that problem.  The reality of the matter is Alexander is a commendable and valiant effort but pitching that against superior offering by Ridley Scott, it's simply a good but forgettable movie whilst Kingdom of Heaven seemed to be a well planned and executed balanced movie which would be seen as a standard for the Crusades theme in the forseeable future.

The film doesn't feel at ease with itself. It says too much, and yet leaves too much unsaid.""  I fully agree.  Ebert gave the film two stars; yet, as you can see, I have given the film four.  Please allow me to explain.

The first time a started to watch this film, I had no idea what it was about, I had very little knowledge of the 'Alexander' story, and I had heard the film was reviewed poorly.  To be totally honest, I made it about half way through and then shut it off.  I found it to be long, tedious, overly complex, and down right boring.  Names were being said and places were being mentioned, and I had no idea who was referring to whom or what.  Aaaahhhhhh!  Accordingly, if someone had asked my opinion, at that time, I would have probably given this film one star, at best.

Some months down the road, however, I began to explore the 'Alexander' legend.  In response, I had ordered a book from Amazon by Robin Lane Fox, titled 'Alexander the Great.' As I later came to find out, this was the exact book Oliver Stone used as the inspiration for his movie.  I read the book, enjoyed it, and then went back to view Stone's film.  Upon the second viewing, I enjoyed the film immensely.  Of course, with this second viewing, I came in with a great deal of background knowledge.  As a result, the names and places, etc. were familiar to me, which provided me with a much need frame of reference.  Knowing that Stone's film was inspired by Fox's book, I was able to understand Stone's direction, etc.  In short, if you are watching, or thinking about watching, this movie because you want to be entertained by another action packed gladiator movie, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!  However, if you are interested in Greek history, and the spread of Hellenism, I would recommend that you read a history book first, such as Fox's.  If you enjoy Fox's book, and would be interested in watching a cinematic 'version' of it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM.

All this to say, Ebert is right.  This movie is an unfinished group of cinematic sketches and notes.  In order to understand, and appreciate these 'sketches and notes,' one has to read Fox's book... then it will all make sense - well at least more sense.  I, however, realize that very few people will be willing to read a five hundred page book just to make sense out of a movie. Oh well... And there are, of course, some key battles and/or victories that Stone leaves out (or doesn't properly address) in his film, but, when making a movie, time is always a factor.",1140393600,18,2664,4.481327800829876
2310345,2,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's long in development bio-pic of Alexander the Great is, sadly, one big mess.  The first thing you'll notice is some outrageously over the top acting, not to mention the mis-casting of Colin Farrell in the title role with a blonde mane and unquestionable love for his long time buddy (Jared Leto).  Angelina Jolie sleep walks as Alexander's snake charming mother, a heavy Val Kilmer looks like he just walked off the set of Wonderland and had makeup over his eye applied, and the only bright spot of the entire casting is the great Anthony Hopkins providing a reflective voice over throughout the film, and it's the only way you'll know what's going on in this otherwise incoherent mess.  It's hard to believe that with the talent involved in Alexander that it turned out like this.  We know that he was a legendary conquerer and strategist, but by the time the credits roll, the only question you're left asking is what's the point?  It's disappointing that something Stone appeared to have so much heart in ended up like this (his commentary is definitely worth hearing on this DVD release as he discusses the film's bad press), but believe it or not, Alexander could be a lot worse.

2310346,2,B0009PLLN6,"Of all the people in this world, I should be one to give this movie 5 stars.  I would be thrilled to give it 5 stars.  I would love to be able to brag to people how wonderful & well done it was.  Unfortunately, I cannot ethically do any of the above.

First a little on me.  I have studied the life of Alexander of Macedon for the past 15 years.  I've read books and essays on his life, including the biography by Arrian. I wrote a term paper on his life while in college.  I own several documentaries on his life.  I have studied the background facts of Greek culture extensively.  As I mentioned, I should have loved this movie  & in fact I wanted to love it.

Now a little on the movie.  Somehow, it just didn't work.  Colin Farrell is a good cast for Alexander and most of the acting is decent.  The battle scenes are impressive and the soundtrack is pretty good (fittingly written by a Greek - Vangelis).  However, in the end it falls short of being worthwhile, and not even Sir Anthony Hopkins appearing as the elderly Ptolemy can change this fact.

The basic problem with the film is that it's.....well.....boring (and my it pains me to say that!).  That a movie on Alexander's life would take 3+ hours to pull off is not surprising.  Unfortunately, this is 3+ hours of rather dull cinema.  The movie will have a spectacular battle scene and then get bogged down by some rather inconsequential aspects of Alexander's life.  Sadly, it seems to go on & on & on with some of these footnote elements.

There are a few scenes here & there that are well done.  And, there are also some anecdotes of his life that happened kinda / sorta the way they appear in the film.  It's accurate that Alexander was bi-sexual too, but it's not necessary to hammer this fact over the head of the audience.

In the end, if you're fascinated by the life of Alexander, this film is maybe worth seeing - once.  If not, you will probably walk out of this film thinking that his life was dull and ho-hum.  That is just too bad.  If you want to see a well-done movie on the ancient Greeks, see TROY.  It was everything this film lacked.

If you are interested in the life of Alexander, but don't want to sit through a boring movie, I'd recommend IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER by Michael Wood (available on DVD from Amazon.com).  It's a far more worthwhile depiction of his life than this.",1140220800,4,2368,4.352402745995423
2310347,1,B0009PLLN6,"While I cannot imagine anyone truly capturing either Alexander the man, nor his life and its complexities, certainly the worst people one might think of are the Irish Colin Farrel and American director Oliver Stone. Without the ability to truly understand how a boy who stood 5'9"" tall, was absolutely gorgeous, inwardly destroyed by his devouring mother and bewildered yet powerful father, who led his first army as general before the age of 16, whose life-long companion was another man, Hephastion, and his only ""lover"" of record a Persian eunuch named Bagoas--without the ability to enter into the time, place, and mores of both, the story simply cannot be told in a couple of hours on a movie screen in a time and place where such details would bring out the therapists in force. Yet @ 2300 yrs. ago these circumstances came together to create the extraordinarily magnetic and indomitable force of nature now called ""Alexander the Great."" His two marriages were politically motivated (and to get an heir), his belief in his half-godhood absolute (his mother had taught him that Philip was not his father, but rather a god who came to her in man-form to beget him) and his determination to conquer the world driven by a constant need to test himself against all the odds that could be found. Homosexuality was the norm then, not the exception; actually bisexuality was most common, with Philip moving between boys, young men, and girls in constant succession as just one example. There was no judgement about this--but modern American audiences seem unable to understand that sexual ""norms"" change with time and place constantly, or that our Puritan values are not even remotely absolutes, even in the rest of the world right now.

Yet the supposedly maverick director, Oliver Stone, cannot bring himself to fully enter into this mentality, but rather emphasizes a political, formal, and brief relationship that consisted of marginal sex (Roxanne), barely enough to produce a son (she was pregnant when Alexander died), that Bagoas was Alexander's nightly lover, Hephastion his true spouse. Roxanne was never made queen. She was a secondary wife. His wife of state, Stateira, was murdered by Roxanne the moment Alexander died--just as Olympias had had Philip's wife and son killed the moment he died and Alexander's back was turned.

Alexander himself exuded such authority and command that he was able to lead men who'd been full-grown when he was a babe, but Colin Farrel's wide-eyed vacancy just cannot capture his essence, let alone the belief in his deeds. And without these essentials firmly in place, the rest is pointless. We know that Alexander conquered all of the known world, so seeing him do it in battle after battle isn't terribly fascinating to watch; watching Alexander himself taking exercise would have been more compelling.

Oddly, Olympias, played by Angelina Jolie, is not even given her famous red hair--apparently the budget didn't allow for hair dye. Presumably her strange accent is to communicate that she comes from another part of Greece: she was from Epiros, while Philip was an Argive, and they all three lived in MACEDON (which while called ""Macedonia"" in the film, is not to be confused with the current country Macedonia, which isn't even in the same place). She was indeed a Priestess of Dionysis, her snakes were sacred creatures--all of them non-poisonous house snakes, and in the film, clearly constrictors, yet she warns Alexander against them ""striking,"" a physical impossibility (this is the level of inaccuracy on display here). She tried to rule through Alexander, whom she'd dominated all her life. Jolie could have been wonderful, had she been allowed to play Olympias, rather than a sort of Dracula-figure of Stone's imagination. She was a deeply dangerous woman, in fact, whose murders were so numerous that she was condemned to death after her son died, yet so revered was Alexander that no one dared kill his mother. In the end she was given over by Kassandros to the relations of those she'd killed, who tore her apart (literally). What fun Jolie could have had with some of the most famous of Olympias' escapades, had she ever seen them written in the script. Roxanne and her unprotected son ended murdered, also by Kassandros, amidst the wars the shook Greece when Alexander died. The wars of succession did, in fact, tear Alexander's great accomplishment apart--the unification of the known world under one central leader disintegrated as his ""heirs"" fought over the pieces they were strong enough to hold. Only Ptolemy lasted, establishing Alexandria and contiuing his line through to the great Kleopatra.

Any movie that requires constant narration is in deep trouble--the ponderous narration of Hopkins as Ptolemy (who is now old, but was in fact only ten years older than Alexander, his half-brother and dear friend) once he's become Pharoah (in Alexandria, which then became the capital city of the Persian Empire) after the wars of succession following Alexander's demise at 33, is even more irritating than the off-color performances and wrongly presented ""facts."" Trying to piece together this patchwork quilt of disastrous episodes, Hopkins does his best, but doesn't have much of a chance. And after narrating this entire movie to his scribes, he dismisses the story as mere ""story"" and ""changes"" history to the unknowable. This especially makes one wonder why Stone went to all this trouble and expense, if he himself was going to end by undermining what he's told (however inaccurately).

Nor does poor Jared Leto get much of substance to do, having been tongue- and hog-tied into being a silent partner despite playing the most important person in Alexander's life; he mostly stands around looking supportive and adoringly at his spouse, but we don't see him as the powerful commander he was, and most importantly, the second self that Alexander considered him to be. We see that he's allowed to read the royal mail from Olympias, but it's never explained why this is significant, nor do we see the really important act which followed it. When another soldier called out to Alexander, ""Why can't we read your mail, too?"" Alexander took off his signet ring, pressed it against Hephastion's lips, and then smiled at the assembly, publicly declaring their one-ness to all. Later, when Bagoas, his Persian lover, won the dancing crown, the crowd cried out to Alexander to ""kiss the boy,"" which he did. Alexander was certainly unafraid of letting people know who mattered to him, so why Stone should be squeamish is truly mysterious. And so well was Hephastion's status known that it has always been understood that Alexander willed himself to death after his death--the deliberate lack of care for himself that brought on the fever that took his life, came right after Alexander had received the news from Zeus Ammon's oracle that Hephastion would not be made a demigod. This devestated him; his mourning had been intense for three months, and he'd given Hephastion a funeral and pyre more extravagant than those given to Kings. He was already feared to have lost his reason by this time, due to his army's reluctance to continue and his forced acceptance at having to go home, and the loss of his life-long love was too much. After having driven himself without mercy since he was a small boy, he collapsed. His final act was to allow his grieving army to file past his bed--it took hours and left him in a coma from which he never woke. He was alone with Bagoas and the Companions at the door when he slipped out of consciousness, though his well-documented ""failure to decay"" which was then attributed to his semi-godhood status is now recognized as deep coma, in which he lingered for several days in the hot desert while his soldiers fought. Finally he was taken away to be embalmed, without having lost any of his beauty. Several hundred years later, his preserved body was observed as ""looking like a sleeping man, still rich with beauty and life-force"" (I think by Curtius).

Many other famous events are rendered incorrectly: Kassandros (called Kassander here), played with nasty glee by the ever and ever-better Johathyn Rhys-Meyers, was Alexander's mortal enemy, and had been cut out from his ""companions,"" and left behind in Macedon long before Alexander died, yet he's seen leaning over Alexander at the momen of his death, as are others, when Ptolemy's own writing stated that he died with only Ptolemy and Bagoas in the room. As for Kassandros, he was, briefly, in Babylon when Alexander died, but as he was not allowed anywhere near the King (let alone in his bedchamber), it was rumoured that he had his younger brother, Iolus, Alexander's cup-bearer, poison Alexander just as he was starting to recover from his fever. Another serious inaccuaracy is about Darius, whom Alexander so easily conquered: Darius never took the field against Alexander--not in the way one usually thinks. The Persians were so firmly entrenched in power and Darius so amused at the notion of being conquered by a boy, he did nothing till it was too late, and when he did go to war it was in a golden chariot, in which he ran in terror from Alexander's approach on both ocassions they came near to one another. He was also lazy and cowardly--his army traveled with his entire household, wives, concubines, eunuchs--that he was no match for Alexander's light-horsed, light-marching speed. The two never even saw one another due to Darius' flight, leaving his mother and wife to their fates. Luckily for the women, Alexander was respectful, sequestered them, keeping them safe, and in fact became close to Darius' mother, Sisygambis, (who was the one to mistake Hephastion, the taller, more ""regal"" figure, and it was to her that Alexander said, ""You were right, Mother, he is Alexander, too."") When Alexander died, Sisygambis turned her face to the wall and starved herself to death out of grief, while her own son's death she met with contempt due to his cowardice. The scene where we see the Persian women surrounded by men from Alexander's army is outrageous: Persian women were so modest that they never saw or spoke to strange men, and Alexander never subjected them to such scrutiny--he was famous for his incredible respect for the women, even the Persian ones, under his care. It's believed that he had in mind to reunite Darius with his wife, as a peace offering and gesture of respect. If it had been Stone's idea to reveal the man to us, it would have been through such acts that we could have gotten to know him, not through battle scenes.

Alexander's beloved horse's name isn't even pronounced correctly! Boukephalos, not Bucephalos--the ""c"" is hard, not soft, and it seems to me that an ""historical"" film should have some notion of such details. And in Macedonian, he was called ""Oxhead""; Bukephalos is Greek, and Alexander mostly spoke his native tongue with his friends and his army.

Alexander was a man so wounded, so powerful, so beautiful, so intense in his need to excel, so driven, so loyal, so hungry for power but not for the sake of power, but for the sake of glory. Like Achilles, whom he quoted often, he had chosen between glory and length of days. That this movie shows none of that glory, none of the love he felt for those whose trust he had implicit, none of his sense of justice, is sad and wasteful. Stone claims to have read Mary Renault's Alexander historical novels, yet clearly didn't understand anything of them. If anyone wants to learn who Alexander really was, reading ""The Fire from Heaven,"" ""The Persian Boy"" and ""The Nature of Alexander,"" and to learn the details that followed his death in ""Funeral Games,"" would be a better place to start than this mess of a movie.",1139961600,35,11771,4.932425617750883

So many of the people out there have a problem with that part of the movie...I think it was one of the best parts of the movie! To love someone so much, to care about someone as much as they did, where is that wrong? How can so many people have a problem with that...just because they are two men?

Now as far as the acting goes...

Colin Farrell...I thought that he did an awsome job...maybe not the BEST, but an AWSOME job of showing the heart and thought of Alexander.

Angelina Jolie...also an amazing job. She brought the character Olympias to life.

Jared Leto...I disagree with EVERYONE who says that he has no talent in this movie...I think he was as true Hephaistion as any of us could have thought of. He did an AMAZING job in this movie!

Val Kilmer...I thought that he was as good of a Philip as he could be...I'm not sure that he was MEANT to play that role, but he did do a good job!

As far as a total overview goes...I completely disagree with the critics that said it wasn't good enough...and the homophobes that only disliked it because of the Hephaistion and Alexander scenes...which we already know how I feel about those!",1139184000,17,1406,4.409266409266409
2310350,2,B0009PLLN6,"There is a myth and legend that when Julius Caeser saw a status of Alexander the Great, he broke down and cried because Alexander had conquered the world and Caeser had accomplished nothing in his lifetime.  That was Caeser's turning point, and another great man was born.  Alexander would emerge from Macedonia at age 17, never to return to his homeland, to conquer 90% of the known world, crush and kill all his enemies, and die at the ripe old age of 33.

This movie, however, fails to deliver the most pleasing portrail of this war hero.  We see those who were supposed to be the great influences in his life, namely his mother and father.  Angelina Jolie, who is usually the lovable vamp, comes across in some odd Russian accent.  Her love for her son is obvious, but her marriage to Val Kilmer is anything but happy.  She is adament that her son will become a great man and a military leader.  His father is a drunken slob who doesn't seem to care much for him, as he is a reminder of his marriage to Angelina.  As he grows, his love of miltary grows, and he eventually leaves home to conquer the world.

So why is this movie bad?  It's bad because of the jumpy, choppy editing.  We are flashing back and forth too much from his childhood to adulthood.  Many were bent out of shape about the obvious love between him and Jared Leto, but guess what?  Homosexuality was celebrated among ancient Greek culture, and is today!  It was all told in flashback, and it became just plain annoying.

If you're looking for a history lesson, it's annoying because the story does not run smoothly.  And Colin Farrell?  It's a little ironic that the woman he married has a resemblence to the woman in his illicit sex tape.  He's an alright actor, but he's a rude, drunken slob and I can't get past it.  Alexander would be flipping over in his grave.",1138924800,2,1840,4.452095808383233

I guess that Alexanders sexuality might be bi/homosexual/insestuous with his mother or whatever but really, who cares? With all the magnificent things he did in his short life Oliver Stone seems to want to concentrate on his sexuality more than putting time into making a good movie. Jared Letos part as Colin Farrells boytoy was nauseating not because they were lovers but because his character was underdeveloped and basically consisted of he and Farrell making goo goo eyes at each other every time they were in each others site.

""Alexander"" is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past.  Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in ""Oliver"" that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of ""Where Is Love?"" before his part was over).  None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch.  Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.

Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue.  It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.

For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone.  Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of  ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""Nixon,"" and ""JFK"" (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of ""JFK"").  The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on.  The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is definitely impressive.

At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of ""Alexander"" is a mighty long haul indeed.",1138233600,7,2348,5.0859375
2310354,5,B0009PLLN6,"The usual criticism to ""Alexander"" is the strange accent of Angelina Jolie (Olympias), but these critics never realise that Alexander's mother is not Macedonian but Epirote, a ""barbarian"" for the Greeks, who even despised Macedonians as barbarians close to Thracians and considered Epirotes as hillbillies more related to the Illyrians than to the Greeks. And that's the reason for the accent of Val Kilmer (Phillip II) but not in the case of Alexander, educated by a Greek tutor, Aristotle, who is supposed to speak ""pure"" Greek, without the Macedonian or Epirote dialectal variant.

Good movie, first time I see ancient Greeks dressed as ancient Greeks (and ancient Persians dressed as ancient Persians), and dwell in real ancient Greek, Babylonian and Persian cities. Excellent work. The movie should be longer, four or five hours at least.

2310355,3,B0009PLLN6,"First off, you can't do this story justice as a documentary. It's too big, too complex and too many facts are unknown. But what Oliver Stone used to be good at doing was taking a page from history, embellishing it ""slightly"" and telling it as a lesson for the ages. ""JFK"" might not have been completely faithful to the facts, but it was great cinema with major impact. This is not. This comes across more as a digitally enhanced remake of the 1956 movie with Richard Burton or, at its best, ""Natural Born Killers"" writ large. Questions: what's up with the Anglo actors portraying Greeks? Why couldn't Stone break away from that historically bogus cliche? And the accents...Val Kilmer with a scottish brogue and Angelina Jolie sounding like Natasha from a ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon. Wrong, just wrong, man. As is the eyeliner (jeeeez) and long straight hair of Alex's main dude Heaphastion. I just can't picture this guy surviving very long on the battlefield. Another big problem is with the total lack of anything remotely resembling Alexander as a mythical near-immortal leader as portrayed by Colin Farrel, who looks more like a cross between George W. Bush and Jim Carrey in a flowing blonde wig. Rosario Dawson as Roxanne doesn't really mean anything to the movie except a nude scene, which at least (very temporarily) alleviates the flagging interest in the storyline. As far as the disjointed flashbacks and the crappy narration by a veeeery tired Anthony Hopkins, we'd be better off without them. And the battle scenes could have been reduced by at least half in running time. Perhaps one of these decades somebody might make a decent version of this story. Swing and a miss on this one, though.",1137542400,3,1708,4.852739726027397
2310356,1,B0009PLLN6,"In the pantheon of the greatest human beings who ever lived, in terms of influencing the history of the world, Jesus Christ ""ranks"" number one and Alexander the Great ranks number two, for similar albeit different reasons.  Both influenced history more than others, and died at essentially the same age, 33.  Jesus changed man's relationship to God and thereby ""conquered"" much of the world, while Alexander's territorial conquests spread democracy and the assimilation of disparate cultures.  Both were remarkable leaders who possessed super-human qualities, including wisdom and fearlessness.

In a sense, their lives were intertwined because the spread of Christianity as a world religion (owing to the Greek language), as well as the Roman Empire and the long centuries of Byzantium are all said to be the fruits of Alexander's achievements. As a general, Alexander (or Alexander III of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.) is considered to be among the greatest the world has ever known.  He was recognized as pharaoh (or god incarnate) of Egypt; and his general Ptolemy founded the fabled Egyptian dynasty that ended with the death of Cleopatra (who was named for Alexander's full sister), the last of the Ptolemies.  Alexander's wife, Roxane, is a story of love and alliances-and of their son, born posthumously.

It is sad, but totally predictable, that the epic tale of Alexander's life and deeds has been twisted by Oliver Stone, whose perversion of the topics he films is legendary.  Why any movie studio finances this hack remains a mystery.  One need know little or nothing about ""Alexander,"" the movie, to realize that Stone would turn the great Alexander into a farcical Gay hero, or bisexual at best. Yet, there is no historical evidence that such was the case.  At that time in history, bisexuality was present just as it is today; however, it was predictable before the first camera rolled that Stone would make such characteristics central to Alexander's character.

Also, it is clear that Stone miscast the leading actors in his film, and that it is disjointed and fails to depict any greatness at all.  While the story of Alexander's life and accomplishments and place in history is a tale that surpasses David Lean's brilliant and timeless ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" Stone is incapable of telling such a story or picking the actors to enrich the screen, much as the young Peter O'Toole played T.E. Lawrence so magnificently.  It is only too bad that Lean is not alive to do justice to such an epic; Stone is a rank amateur when compared to the greatness of Lean.

While due respect might be given to Stone's ability to raise the money in Hollywood (and abroad) for such a film-where history is distorted on a daily basis-""Alexander"" was doomed from the moment when Stone was chosen because of his lack of talent, political biases, and inability to properly cast the film.  He failed, whereas the true story of Alexander succeeded beyond one's wildest imagination. To read the history of Alexander's life is to realize that he surpassed the exploits of his revered Greek gods.  Yet, Stone lacks even a modicum of greatness as a moviemaker to depict one of the greatest figures and stories in history.

Stone's reputation is tainted, which is certainly true of his films.  Some day the real story of Alexander's greatness will be told, with a cast that does justice to the epic, including some unknown actor playing Alexander as O'Toole played Lawrence, instead of the relative pygmies who dance on Stone's one-dimensional canvas.  People were walking out on the movie in Los Angeles, and it would be a miracle if it earned even a fraction of its estimated $200 million production and marketing costs in the U.S.

The Toronto Star aptly called it ""not just a bad movie but a bad movie of truly epic proportions.""  That may have been an understatement.",1137542400,5,3852,4.959564541213064

Too, too many pep talks before battles that go on so long, you find you've tuned out. I'm surprised he didn't put his troops to sleep! Colin also has only ONE expression, exactly like Elijah Wood in all three Lord of The Rings movies: terror and panic, basically the expression of ""I just crapped my pants!""

Bad casting of supporting actors. Persia is now Iraq or Iran, but we see those folks every night on the news. They are dark in hair and skin; Alexander's Anglo supporting actors looked like Vikings.

Very bad battle scenes. No choreography, just wild shaking of cameras and irritatingly fast panning. In the elephant battle, you actually see an extra get hit in the face by an obviously rubber elephant trunk! That's either lazy filming or Stone had not idea how to do battle scenes.

It is impossible to have hair that blond and eyes that dark brown unless you're an Italian woman dress designer. I should think that casting Alexander would be almost impossible, but Farrell isn't the one. Angelina Jolie at times is a commanding figure as his mother Olympias, but she speaks with a strange accent and couldn't possibly be old enough to be his mother.

I believe it was within the first ten minutes or so that I started feeling like I wanted the movie to end soon.

Well... maybe that honor should go to Waterworld, but that's arguable.

In a movie like this, where the focus is on one of the sigle most influential, dynamic, forceful personalities in history, you'd think that some real character development would be an essential ingredient in the film.  Instead, we get 20 second blurbs of some less-than-powerful monents in his youth peppered with some powerful scenes that try to reach for high drama yet just seem out of place and disjointed.  Like that 5 minute stagger through the wall murals with his father... dear God, we miss 99% of what made this man who he is, and Stone sacrifices five minutes on THAT?  Stone also completely skips his maturation into a warrior/general.  I mean COMPLETELY.  We totally miss his charisma as a leader of men and his brilliance as a tactician and/or visionary.  One scene, he's a boy.  The next, he's already liberated a chunk of Persia (we don't get to see this... it's literally the next scene) and is leading the charge to take the Persian army in the only decent battle scene in the film.  He is turned back, but not to worry, the very next scene he's walking into Babylon while the narrator informs us he came back and won.  His entire eastward campaign (and thus the movie) just sort of happens in this same fashion... the narrator says stuff like ""and then Alexander took <fill in any country here>"" and we jump to a victory scene where he sits and drinks wine and the vanquished foe has people dance for him.  The battles we do see are poorly filmed with very little drama or energy, a complete lack of director's focus, and some of the least effective cinematography ever used in such scenes.

2310363,2,B0009PLLN6,"To make an epic feature, first you need a historical character.  Choose a king, or a tyrant, and be prepared to show him as both beloved of the people, and disliked for his mistakes, usually the mistakes that come from the Shakespearian tragic hero conceit of having too much pride (hubris) or being too driven on a certain goal that he neglects other important aspects of rulership.

Secondly, you need beautiful people to fill predominant roles.  Choose someone like Colin Farrell, since he's popular, and Angelina Jolie for a seductress.  Choose Jared Leto to be a pretty boy and Rosario Dawson for the historical character's wife.  Then fill all of the extras and back-up roles with ugly fat men and maybe the occassional ethnic woman or two.

About the dialog, there are three types: first... there's the dramatic whisper...which you put pauses in between each clause... and then inflex the voice down at the end; secondlythere'sthesomewhatloudbutfastpacedmediumdialog that ends with each word carefully accented; THIRDLY EVERYONE MUST YELL AT EACHOTHER IMPORTANTLY!  Important scenes should contain transitions between all three types.

No epic feature should ever be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes long.  Include long marches and sand-and-sandal imagery.  Have slow, whispery dialog speeches that last ten minutes.  Include epic battle scenes that contain about a thousand aerial shots of armies clashing cross-cut with close-ups of people screaming with the occassional sudden cut of two bodies running into each other and falling down.

And the most important thing you need to do to make a typical epic feature: at any point it seems the story might be able to end, make something happen just to make quite clear to the audience that the end is never, ever coming.

Those are the rules Oliver Stone adhered to in order to put some meat, so to speak, on his analysis of the conquerer Alexander the Great.  I can see what he wanted to do... too bad he left all the important stuff to a five minute battle about two and half hours into the film.  The rest of it was just kind of filler space,  with the only seemingly inherent interest being the homosexuality.  I think he put that in there just so that people'd have something to talk about before the climactic battle at the end.

2310364,3,B0009PLLN6,"I felt Oliver Stone missed the point of making this a true historical epic.. Oliver stone put to much focus on the characters and neglected the interesting significance of the history and culture that surrounded Alexander in that day. This was evident as we recieved a vague view of Babylon, greece, Alexanderia and India. There was hardly an impression that this story was taking place during the 3rd century BC. There wasn't so much of an extended street shot in Macedonia to provide the viewer a vicarious experience of being there. This failure to connect the viewer with the historical aspects of that period was  one of the major  downfalls of this movie.. Sure there were great special effects and fight scences but, ""Alexander"" failed to capture the emphasis on History and Culture To the level ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"" Achieved. Those movies were more visually compelling to the viewer by showing the the vast scale and detail of the cities and surroundings which gave the viewer an idea of being there..
I also Felt Collin Farrell looked to weak and small in stature to be a believable conquerer. Colin didn't embellish the characher which proved that he wasn't the right actor for this role. Collin that I think this role could have been played by an other actor that was randomly chosen. In spite Farrel's average acting job and sub par stage presence, Oliver Stones portrayal  of Alexander as a suicidal and sensitive madman was the major flaw which prevented the character from being likeable or understandible. Stone failed to show Alexander's intelligence for strategical battle skills. Instead, we are lead to believe that each victory was as a result of Alexanders suicidal tendencies in battle which simply is rediculous.. It's true that history showed Alexander to be very daring and brave however, his accomplishments as a conquerer were mainly driven by his vision and strategies to overcome his opposition..I didn't so much mind the homosexual scenes however, I felt they were over emphasized while other important points of Alexanders character traits as a conquerer were not emphasized enough.
By the way, Val Kilmer and Angelina did a good in their roles..",1136246400,3,2180,5.016574585635359
2310365,5,B0009PLLN6,"Far too many people viewed this movie with preconceived notions about what they thought Alexander was, and far more never actually studied ancient history at all. For those interested in ancient history (like myself), it was a nice film. At least Hollywood is begining to appreciate real life history enough to create modern representations of ancient events/legends. Too many people complained about the way Alex was portrayed in the film, but don't we all create our own images of what we would want heros and legends to be? This is simply Oliver Stone's manifestation of the character. No one can every really know how things were, or how Alex actually was despite historical accounts (victors always write history). For those who don't like the homosexual aspect of Alexander's character, don't be mad with history (how could you?). History is history, you're welcomed to hate it or love it-  what we want to believe will never make any difference to recorded history . Alexander was bisexual as were multiple other ancient kings, rulers, lords etc. Facts are facts and none of what we believe has any bearing on the astounding accomplishments of such a puzzling figure in human history.",1136160000,8,1191,5.015151515151516
2310366,3,B0009PLLN6,"Okay, first of all, this movie was okay, and that's being generous.  It reminded me of Troy and Gladiator and all those types of movies.  Its story was sort of weak and there was no real emotions in it, and you didn't really get invested in the characters.

BUT i watched the whole thing mainly because Colin Farell is so fine, AND that HOT boy-toy of his in the movie.  Not Jared Leto, but the Persian one.  See, thats the only thing that kept my interest, the homo-eroticism and the cute boys, like Colin, Jared, and the hot Persian.

I have a question for those who've watched the Directors cut or the DVD.  Do they include deleted scenes?  I was disapointed to find out that apparently there were love scenes between Alexander and the hot Persian, but Warner Bros.  made Oliver Stone cut them out.  Are they in the Directors cut or on the Special Features?  I SO want to watch that!!!

Anyway, i give it 3 stars because its cool that theres this main-stream blockbuster with an obviously gay lead character.  Sure, he has a wife, but he's obviously not really into her, and only wants her so he can have an heir.  I think its pretty clear in the film that Alexander is gay, or atleast more into guys that girls.  So for that and all the sexy men, i give it 3 stars.  peace!",1136160000,3,1277,4.324894514767933
2310367,1,B0009PLLN6,"This film was too long for its own good.  If you want to sit around for 3 hours and be bored this movie is great for you.  Or if you are having trouble getting to sleep, this is a perfect for late night restlessness.  I must say I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie, but only because I dozed off maybe a couple dozen times.  My kids walked out on mid-movie, they couldn't take the torture any longer.  Movies to me is like peace, I want to give it chance.  Unfortunately it was a waste of of my precious time.  This movie was about Alexander but I really don't feel like I have learned much but that he's gay, has a crazy mother, and his eyebrows are too dark for his hair color.

The movie flip flops back and forth from past and present in a very awkward, insignificant way.  I guess it was just the producers way of being artistic or something.  I don't understand why Angelina Jolie had to talk with an accent when everyone else spoke perfect English. And what the heck did they put on Collin's head? Is that a wig or a mullet?

If you want to learn about Alexander I think a History Channel special would have been 10 times more entertaining than this movie and probably a whole lot shorter and to the point as well. And whats the deal with the gay-type scenes? Was there a point to it? Or were the producers trying to get brownie points with the gay community with cheesey little innuendos of homosexuality? This film is definitely no Gladiator and the battle scenes are boring as heck.  There are no good parts in this movie and looking at the DVD cover, it pretty much explains how good this movie is.  There are no good reviews.  I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if Alexander was played by Ben Stein. Don't get this movie. It is horrible!",1135555200,3,1766,4.232835820895523
2310368,1,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander is a biopic of the legendary warrior who, by the age of 25, ruled most of the known world and died -- not with a bang but a whimper -- at 32.

Yet, in this interpretation, it is unclear exactly what made Alexander (played by Colin Farrell) a great leader. He may have conquered the world, but it was a world indifferent to conquest. His troops followed for the sake of Macedonia, as well as the legacy of his father, but they never believed in Alexander's vision. That comes as no wonder -- even his pre-battle pep talks lack any motivation.

Alexander's success began with the destruction of the Persian forces, and ended with his own defeat in India, but these two battle scenes are marred by extreme close-ups and butchered editing. Director Oliver Stone seems so desperate to create art, his usual flair degenerates into a psychedelic nightmare with the Indian sequence tinted shocking pink. Further, with the now prevalent cinematic armies enhanced by CGI, the scope of these scenes fails to impress and inadvertently slows the film's pace.

Despite much publicity, the film is not any more homo-erotic than Spartacus was 44 years ago. Though Alexander and his childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto) vow their eternal love for one another, they never consummate their feelings. More questionable is Alexander's Oedipal relationship with his conniving stage mother (Angelina Jolie), who urged him to ""take the world"". Perhaps he pushed relentlessly eastward in an effort to distance himself from her.

The pointless screenplay is filled with innumerable monologues of pensive thought and rationale, while the narration (by Anthony Hopkins) is not chronological, weaving forwards and backwards more than once.

Thus, Hollywood's Golden Boy Farrell seems lost in the muddled storyline; he also looks ridiculous with platinum-blond hair. Jolie's performance is made all the more campy by her character's obsession with snakes, and Leto is ineffective at anything more than being fey. A bored Val Kilmer also appears as Alexander's drunken father, whose sole purpose is to spew misguided rhetoric.

Curiously, the large cast represent enough different accents to fill the United Nations, but not one sounds Greek. And there are an unusual number of both unnervingly pretty men and scarred-eyed soldiers. Lastly, the new-age score by Vangelis is entirely inappropriate.

Alexander starts out on a promising note, but becomes much less interesting when it tries to define his greatness. While idolizing Achilles (played earlier this year by Brad Pitt in an equally dreary film), Alexander himself aspired to God-hood. Sadly, happiness is one thing he never found. And neither will the audience. Rating: 3 out of 10.",1135296000,9,2726,5.210045662100456

Both versions are worth it and that's why I bought both. The Director's Cut is tighter and some scenes were replaced to make more cinematic sense. Yes, it works better, but the original theatrical release has a few more scenes that you'll miss if you've seen them before.

The flaws this movie exhibits are a few, but like any Physics major would tell you, if you apply a counter force of the same magnitude, it'll balance itself out.

2310376,2,B0009PLLN6,"I thought this thing might be mildly entertaining to me given the number of people I've known who claimed to be Alexander reincarnated. The character has never interested me, I can't find much that's compelling behind that whole `see, want, trample, grab' greedy tot thing; still, one would think that knowing the main character personally, so to speak and with tongue tucked firmly in cheek, would be reason enough to sit still and watch a movie without falling asleep. And, I suppose, even megalomaniacs must have personalities. Unfortunately, apparently Oliver Stone couldn't find much of interest either, apart from pointing out Alexander's homosexual attachments and thus, rather than remembering that wasn't unusual for the time and place, drawing the unfortunate conclusion that the lad must also be a sissy crybaby unable to demand respect from his troops. It's all one big, illogical mess.

It's difficult to see how this Alexander would have made it across a meadow let alone the battlefields of an unconquered world. While I'm reasonably sure I would have detested Alexander as much as I detest Hitler and Stalin, I'm also sure that if he didn't have an interesting war story or two to tell, then who would? And despite being a girl, I don't mind watching a good fight. The battles here are the poorest depictions I've ever seen. I know they would have been chaotic but surely directors have the sense to not put lengthy passages of meaningless chaos on the screen. Similarly, Ptolemy should be a fascinating chap to chat with over tea, but if he droned on and on as he did in the opening I'd poison the tea. His or mine, no matter. It's an endless banquet of embarrassments, really. I love Colin Farrell but his golden-headed cherub of an Alexander belongs on a Carnival float. I love Angelina Jolie but casting her in a matronly role is absurd, and what was that accent - Ukrainian? Czarist Russian? Greek? Ah, yes, eastern Europe via Hollywood.

2310377,3,B0009PLLN6,"It's not hard to see why this movie did so poorly at the box office. If you view this movie in the context of the Hollywood HYPE surrounding it, you are going to be sadly disappointed. The hype of the movie was ""The greatest legend of all was real!"" ads trumpeted, and ""Fortune favors the bold!""  The public was led to expect a Hollywood blockbuster HERO for us to cheer for.

Instead of Alexander the GREAT, we get Alexander, the flawed commander, the vain, the self deluded. And worse, he's a sexually confused homosexual, suffering incestuous emotional attachment to his overbearing mother and alienated from his emotionally distant father. Certainly not a conventional hero. Worse, Oliver Stone's script leaves you with the impression that Alexander's legacy not a triumph, but a tragedy!

Without a doubt, if this movie missed the mark, it was because of OLIVER STONE's politically skewed script! We might forgive Stone if he made an historically accurate movie, but he didn't.

There are 2 big problems with Stone's skewed script. First, Stone's emphasis on an Alexander afflicted with a severe fraudian opedial complex. Secondly, his portrayal of Alexander motivations as vain glory seeking personal ambition.

According to Stone, Alexander is in love with his mother, hates his father...everyone is acquainted with that quaint Freudian theory. In fact, the interaction between Alexander his mother Olympias, and his father Phillip was probably not as sexually charged as cosmopolitan sophisticates like Stone might imagine. The historical Phillip had 6 wives, of which Alexander's mother was the 4th, not to mention numberous  illegitimate siblings and half-siblings. It's most likely that sexual tension was probably the least important motivator in polygamous families in ancient Greece. As in modern polygamous societies, all the arguments in the marriage are about status, not sex. Any disrespect of Alexander's mother called into question the legitimacy of her offspring to succession. Stone's psycho-sexual interpretation of Alexander's is a speculation that is not only overly done, but mostly likely unrealistic.

The second flaw in the script Stone's portrayal of Alexander as an aristocratic brat with no concern but to sacrifice his army to his ambition to conquor the world. Alexander's victories are not portrayed as a result of his military genius and personal leadership, but as bloody sacrifices of soldiers to his dreams of vain glory.

Stone's puts a lot of emphasis on the tensions between Alexander and his Generals and his soldiers, which, like Stone's interpretation of Alexander's opedial complex, is probably a figment of Stone's own 60s' era bias against military heroism.

Alexander's awesome victory of Gaugamela against overwhelming Persian superior numbers is summed up in the scene of a young soldier so gravely wounded that the kindest act Alexander can offer is to put him out of his misery. Victory over thousands is thus reduced to the tragedy of one man. Instead of cheering, the audience is encouraged to weeping, along with Alexander. Stone's treatment of battle of the Hydaspes is equally proposterous.

Again, we might excuse slanting Alexander's political and military accomplishments if this was the historically accurate. But it's not. In ancient Macedonia's gift-exchange culture, loyalty to a King was purchased with slaves and loot. A warrior people like the Macedonians wanted a warrior king who won battles, because winning battles meant loot. A Macedonan King retained his throne by giving people what they wanted---victory and loot, the expected rewards in a gift-exchange society.

If the historical Alexander had any fatal flaw it wasn't that he failed to live up to the expectations of his followers, but that he didn't know when to stop! But that's not quite how Stone portrayed the conflicts between Alexander, his generals and soldiers.

Stone even missed the mark even on Alexander's love life. The character of Alexander's alleged homosexual lover-confidant Hephaistion is so undeveloped that the relationship is barely recognizable in the movie, except to history buffs. The wedding night bedroom scene with a snarling Persian wife, Roxanne borders on cartoonish.

Stone has given us far more politically biased movies...such as such as ""Nixon"" or ""JFK"" or ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Buy the movie for the gorgious photography, the action scenes, the historically accurate costumes, sets and props--they are ALL wonderful!

Alexander conquered the Persian Empire not mainland Africa so how did he found an African wife and is it really mentioned in historical accounts that he had a wife of the African race?

  Please don't get me wrong on this but I hate to see someday,let's say Tom Cruise portraying the great Martin Luther King in a film.

2310382,4,B0009PLLN6,"Where to begin this review?  I almost feel like I have to defend my position on actually liking the film, which is hard for me to do because my liking of it is sensory and I am usually a more factual person.

What's wrong with Alexander?  Well, it's difficult to be historically accurate even while studying a practically mythological figure, but if you are making a Hollywood film it is next to impossible.  So Alexander the movie only follows the historical aspects of Alexander The Great by the finest of threads.  The dialogue is a little stiff at times also, attempting to modernize into a recognizable pattern the speeches and rituals of a civilization that existed before Christ.  There's a Colin Farrell ""buffalo shot"" that should have been edited out.  And the plot skips around quite a bit, in an unnecessary fashion.  It could have been bloodier, too.

What's right with Alexander?  For one thing, the stunning photography, breathtaking scenery, costume design, and realistic props and settings.  The battle scenes are spectacular, with arrows and pikes and vast armies.  There is one scene in particular, where Alexander goes up against a barbarian, filmed in slow motion as both horse and elephant rear up in facing off with each other, that is so captivating you will find yourself holding your breath.

Colin Farrell did a remarkably good job in portraying Alexander, and Val Kilmer was exceptionally, and startlingly, good as Alexander's father, Philip.  Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy and Christopher Plummer as Aristotle did fine performances, but their parts in the film were lesser than their known talents.  Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympias, surprised me.  Normally, I don't care for her acting, but she fit the role perfectly as a deadly beauty who fondles snakes and schemes for her son's greatness.  I've liked Rosario Dawson since her early appearance in 'Kids', and she doesn't disappoint in her role as Roxane, Alexander's barbarian wife.  I think that her part should have been greater in the film, with more played off of her love/hate relationship with Alexander, but this was a big story to put into one film anyway.  And Jared Leto...woof!  When did Jared Leto become hot?  When he put on eyeliner and a long-haired wig?  I'm not sure, but he plays his role as Hephaistion, Alexander's same-$ex lover, quite well.

Alexander, then, amounts to some very nice eye-candy to watch for its entertainment value.  It's not a documentary but an epically filmed interpretation of Alexander's battle years, when he conquered most of the civilized world (at that time) in the span of eight short years.  Imagine 2500 years from now a film being made about, say, Ronald Reagan.  Will it be accurate?  Doubtful, but it will most likely be made to please the people of that era.

So sit back, pop some popcorn, put the DVD on the bigscreen TV and turn the volume down.  Don't worry about what people say about the $exuality in the film, it is not overt or overplayed, it is simply portrayed as part of Alexander's life, as was common during the time frame of the epic.  Enjoy this film for the lush cinematography and save the documentary for the History Channel.  Its eye-candy, pure and simple.  Enjoy!",1132272000,7,3235,4.900552486187845

2310385,3,B0009PLLN6,"So, according to Oliver Stone, who's never met a piece of history he didn't want to distort, Alexander the Great was a girly man crybaby who let his own men insult and belittle him throughout his whole quest for greatness. The very fact that Stone sensationalized the homosexual malarkey of his Alexander cut the rug out from under this film's feet before it ever hit theatres. Alexander the Great is a name that has resounded throughout history for over two millennia - but the history of that story somehow wasn't good enough for Stone. I think even Freud would shudder at the thought of someone who is not a psychologist or even an historian trying to psychoanalyze a man who died over three hundred years before the birth of Christ. It's unfortunate because this could have been a powerful film.

Skipping back and forth across Alexander's life (Stone apparently thinks is a devilishly clever way to tell a story), we follow the great conqueror's story from his childhood to his death through the eyes of Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). Born to Philip of Macedon and his exotic first wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) -who claimed Alexander was the son of Zeus -Alexander (Colin Farrell) had a complicated childhood. Olympias groomed him to be the next king, worrying all the while that Philip would not recognize him as the legitimate heir. Interestingly, Olympias doesn't seem to age a day between Alexander's birth and his ascendancy to the throne at the age of nineteen. We're talking about Angelina Jolie here, so I couldn't get past the thought that this is an Oedipus complex just waiting to happen. Anyway, Alexander replaces his murdered father, sets off north to establish his control over the tribes there, and then just keeps heading east conquering everything that gets in his way. After his daring defeat of Persia's King Darius, he fights his way all the way into India, farther than anyone before him had ever gone. If he had known those Indian tribes had war elephants, I daresay Alexander might have just turned around at the border and headed back home early. Instead, his military exploits extend over seven years. We hear him talk about assimilating the conquered peoples, and he certainly likes to build Alexandrias all over the place, but this grand vision theme of Alexander's life doesn't get enough play in the movie to sufficiently explain his motives.

The movie does have some strengths. The battle scenes are very impressive (except the end of the final one, when Stone decides to get artistic with it), especially Alexander's ill-fated fight with the elephant-equipped Indian tribes. Blood and guts are spilled on an epic scale. Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing as Alexander's devious, snake-loving mother - but I have no idea where that accent of hers was supposed to have come from. Speaking of strange accents, Colin Farrell sometimes sounded to me like he should have been leading Braveheart's forces. He never became Alexander in my eyes - there just wasn't enough substance to his character. If the film had been nothing but battle scenes, Farrell would have been more convincing; it's the scenes taking place between battles that leads this film astray. Most of this time is spent watching Alexander exchange meaningful glances with pretty boys wearing more makeup than Jezebel. The rest of the time consists of all those loyal men who supposedly adore their brave king whining about the length of the campaign, criticizing Alexander's motives and strategy, and making snide remarks about his heritage. There's no way Alexander the Great let his men talk to him the way they do throughout this film. There's really not much leadership on display by here. Alexander's brave, certainly, but he's no Patton.

Basically, Oliver Stone does a great disservice to Alexander the Great, passing him off as a dandy with little strategic genius and even less control over men who supposedly loved and respected him enough to fight and die for him thousands of miles from home. Stone's characterization of Alexander is just plain weird - and that's the whole problem with this movie. Let's hope that the youth of today and tomorrow don't see this film and actually believe they're seeing an accurate picture of Alexander the Great because Stone's Alexander ain't all that great.",1131408000,5,4297,4.981894150417827
2310386,2,B0009PLLN6,"Normally I don't agree with the pointy-headed intellectuals who write newspaper movie reviews, but for once they were right -- this film is awful.

To begin with, the life of Alexander is one of those stories that is TOO BIG to fit into a movie of normal length. There are too many characters, too many battles, too much politics, too many drunken brawls. It really calls for the TV miniseries format.

But Oliver Stone made a tough job worse by using every trite gimmick in the B-movie director's arsenal -- flashbacks without warning, people reading letters, a silly narration by an old veteran (does this make the whole movie a flashback???), and so help me, a sequence where the colors are all changed!!!  Ed Wood could have done a better job.  To get my brain cells working again, I had to watch SPARTACUS three times.

I gave the movie 2 stars because the spears and armor are historically correct, and the Macedonians even wear authentic floppy sun hats.",1131235200,10,961,4.696428571428571

Alexander the man was not modernized and cleaned up for morals that did not exist when he lived.

The 1956 version with Richard Burton, though not great, is better than this.  Oliver Stone's version put too much emphasis on Alexander's supposed bi-sexuality and not enough on his genius in battle.  Was Alexander really bi-sexual?  Unless you knew him personally, you cannot know for sure.  A Ptolemaic reference is the main source for this belief, but that source was written long after Alexander was dead and... Ptolemy's descendants had reasons to downplay Alexander and exalt Ptolemy.  I don't question that it was fairly common for males in ancient Greece to be bisexual, but I don't think Alexander would last long if he was a fruitcake as portrayed in the movie.",1130371200,5,815,4.912408759124087

2310390,1,B0009PLLN6,"... and not this crap.

""Alexander"" is the worst film I've ever seen. I've been trying to think for days now of a film I like less than ""Alexander"" and I can't. Please note that I have seen ""Eight Crazy Nights,"" Demi Moore's ""Scarlet Letter,"" and much of the MST3K oeuvre (with the benefit of sarky robots, of course, and thank god).

Believe me when I say I wanted, for a very long time, to like this film. I looked forward to it from the first I heard of it, and I am generally extremely, VERY forgiving of epic swordfighting men-in-skirts dramas, as they are right up my alley. I am impressed by detail, accuracy, and weightiness, but I can happily accept some exciting escapism if that's what's offered. Swordsmen in leather skirts make me unusually charitable. But there are LIMITS.

Just so you know, I'm going to spoil like a mo-fo now. I'm not even sorry. And furthermore I consider it a service to all of you -- saving you however-many bucks and three hours of your life that would be far better spent caulking the sink or administering small paper cuts to your inner elbows.

I am amazed -- flabbergasted, even -- at people who try to blame this film's box-office flop on homophobia in the audience, when the film ITSELF is such rabid homophobia thinly disguised as tolerance and education as to be sickening.  Were we all watching the correct film? (or maybe the extended version?  With some vindication in it that I maybe missed? Amazon tends to conflate reviews for all versions in one place.)

I have never seen such an utter contempt for bisexuality played out with such meticulous care in my life. (Full disclosure: I'm a straight woman; take that as you will.) If I were to find out that this movie had been put together by Rick Santorum and Anita Bryant as a scary ""Requiem for a Dream""-type, morality-play depiction of how ""alternative sexuality"" is a tragic mental ailment that invariably leads one down a flaming path of destruction misery madness alienation and death, I would not be surprised.

Every outdated stereotype of the homosexual man is played out. And I'm sure there's more than what I list here: 1) too attached to domineering and overly sexual mother (gayness used to be considered a form of infantilism) 2) at odds with violent, disapproving and often abusive father, and having a weak inability to complete the Oedipal cycle -- replace dad (literal inability to kill him in this case) and hook up with mom or mom equivalent (Roxanne's a little spitfire, just like my Mommy! but sex with her is a joke) 4) constant whiny angst and excessive histrionics -- no certainty or spine of any kind, beyond ""womanish"" 4) all the PREENING and the outfits and the eyeliner and the bacchanals 5) chasing after boys, with pedophilia hinted at -- ""What a pretty army we have now!"" someone says, meaning Alexander's gotten rid of all the ""real-man"" Greek soldiers and replaced them with curly-haired, shiny Babylonian youths 6) oh yeah, the token extreme drag queen.

And 7) all intimacy he was supposed to have had with women was played for giggles. Now the man had three wives -- even the movie admits this -- and if he didn't like women and only needed an heir he could have made do with the first one (and if he were only interested in an heir chances are he wouldn't have chosen Roxanne to give him one -- her ethnicity and class were unsuitable). But the movie -- the director, the actors, everybody -- makes all heterosexual activity forced and ludicrous. Case the first being a stroll through a harem that looks like some virgin high-school freshman's interpretation of how brothel whores act when trying to entice a man. Like a room full of sequestered and sheltered women whose country has just been sent to a bloody defeat are immediately going to leap up and being shaking their butts in sinuous dance at the conquering soldiers? Not a scrap of, oh, I don't know, fear? Maybe a leetle resentment? (No, whoops, sorry, we all love Alexander, that's what the voice-over says so it must be true.)

""Sex"" with his wife is more like watching two cats up on their haunches having a slap-fight -- and the fight -- which takes place on his wedding night -- starts because the wife sees Alexander standing too close to boyfriend Hephaistion (Jared Leto) in her bridal chamber -- giving Alexander a ring! -- and is grossed out by it (and frankly, the audience is practically encouraged to agree with her.  So where's the ""gay-friendly"" in that???). ""You love him?"" she spits. Okay, so Hephaistion is hustled outa there, and Al is STRIPPING her and he's supposed to be looking at Rosario Dawson's naked self with burning lust -- at least, that's the gist of the words that are coming out of his mouth -- but it comes off more like he's an embarrassed teen who's been caught in the bathroom with a dirty magazine. It's not hot, it's not erotic. It's just... goofy.

[Not that the gay love is made any less ludicrous -- it mainly consists of long, arbitrary I-love-you-more-than-life soliloquies which would have embarrassed Romeo and Juliet (and they were 13!). And really long bear hugs. And eye makeup. There's a kiss 2 hours and 15 minutes into the picture, I think -- and not even with Hephaistion! So there. No naked boy love for you.]

And that drag queen boy -- that was contemptible -- not for the sake of historical accuracy (the Persian eunuch Bagoas with whom Alexander had a long-term relationship was a real person) -- but because as a character he was used for no reason other than to make Alexander look weak/bad/silly. He had no lines, he didn't influence the film's plot in any way, he doesn't even get a name until the ending credits. He is not a real person, he is a device. (It's worse when they actually put him in armor.) He is the cinematic equivalent of a guy holding up a big placard to cue a studio audience. ""APPLAUSE"" ""BOO"" ""LAUGHTER"" ""GAY"" He's a human laugh track. Oh my god, he's a friggin ""gay track.""

Anytime anyone questions Alexander's judgment or fitness to rule, anytime a problem crops up, the camera swings in for a long, significant pan over the face and body of this exaggeratedly feminine, flowy-haired, red-lipped human-TelePrompTer (whom I mistook several times for Rosario Dawson. I was not the only one who did this. Which is really disturbing when you figure in the size of her huge bosom and his total lack thereof). This is not to say he wasn't pretty. But he was so obviously just being USED as the shorthand for ""tragic flaw,"" so that by the time they get to India and he performs his rump-shaking dance in a loincloth with six other boys, it's not even interesting anymore and I just want to go home.

And for this blatant stereotype-and-exploitation-FEST to be put out there as ""tolerance"" and ""edginess"" -- for the AUDIENCE to be blamed for not liking it, to hold this effort up as some kind of martyr to forward-thinking -- it is to LAUGH.  Uproariously!

Look, Alexander had documented bisexual behavior -- just like every other Greek/Greek-influenced guy of a certain class and status in his time. It was a side issue, no big deal, something older men did with young men they mentored, and then when the kid no longer needed a mentor they stopped doing it (oversimplification, bear with me, this rant is overlong as it is) and you had your wife so you'd have your heirs (and your concubines) and so on. The societal ""epitome of beauty,"" the standard to strive to, if you will, was that of an attractive male youth (hence why you see all the female statues of the period looking mannish, with heavy shoulders, etc.  Often male models were used and breasts were put on as an afterthought). Alexander's tragic flaw, in a narrative sense, was ambition, and made him brutal and took him way farther from home than it was ever logical to go, and it did eventually kill him -- but this film takes that away from him and tells us that his flaw, his obsession, stemmed from his imbalanced nature, and the outward expression of that imbalance was his homosexuality. So basically we are back to calling gayness a mental illness.

You know, with the benefit of some time and distance, I can say I honestly admire them for wanting to be honest about Alexander's sexuality? But there's a way to battle cultural stereotypes, and burying them within a horrific film -- horrific on all levels -- is just not the way to do it. Whatever they were trying to do -- their end-product had a lot more in common with blaxploitation than ""liberation.""

Angelina Jolie (as mom Olympias), whom I strongly dislike, was the best thing about this film. The only bright spot. She brought life and air to the room and made me feel that my life was not in vain. I perked up every time I heard her odd little Russian accent. (I don't know what she was going for, but it wound up being Russian.) Some critics complained about the snakes, but I've never seen any depiction of the woman that didn't have huge amounts of snakes crawling around -- I'm willing to believe that was at least somewhat rooted in facts. They also complain about her not aging enough, but there are always rumors of sorcery about her -- I think it worked. (I could be grasping at straws.)

Val Kilmer (as dad Phillip) whom I have loved since I was 14: Meh.

Jared Leto (as Hephaistion) tried really hard. I don't blame him.

Rosario Dawson (as first wife Roxanne): Could have been played by anybody attractive.

I had thought Farrell was pretty good with accents, but apparently he's not very, because they solve the continuity problem in this film by having nearly everyone playing a Greek use an Irish accent. Including Val Kilmer and Christopher Plummer. Which was actually kind of interesting -- if not exactly successful -- as compared with that typical mid-Atlantic quasi-British thing they usually do (if the actors are capable or not) with ""epics.""  I do rather like the idea of using accents to denote nationality -- very ""Allo Allo."")

Colin Farrell was dreadfully miscast, which was my main fear all along and was resoundingly fulfilled. He chose to play the role perpetually wide-eyed, flare-nostriled and weepy or verge-of-weepy. Now, his Hollywood rep is for being an arrogant bastard -- why wouldn't he be able to convey some of that arrogance and confidence in this portrayal of someone who for years was the most powerful man in the known world? He should be able to pull off roguishness at best -- but even that is inappropriate. Alexander was not a little puckish man -- he was the beloved and revered general of the world's most powerful army, and that heroic, mythic quality was completely lost. He thought he was a GOD, thought he could scale walls and lay siege to a city by himself, and his men believed it too, to the point where when he was finally wounded it took them nearly too long to go to him and aid him -- they thought he would just heal -- close his own wounds, leap back up to the top of the wall and lead them again. But in this film, people follow him not because he is magnetic or leaderlike or for charisma or prowess, but because he screams louder than they, and because he is the prince/king and they have no choice.

Maybe the film isn't going for myth. But there wasn't any realism either. According to Stone's and Farrell's interpretation, Alexander is an angst-ridden crybaby who would probably lose a playground fight with Rudy Huxtable. (He does lose a playground wrestling match with the kid who will later become his lovah, in a scene where it's revealed that all of the other kids just let him win because he was the prince.) Only the voice-over carries the tale -- TELLING and not SHOWING -- elderly Ptolemy explains how Alexander was ruthless and brutal, how he made an example of Thebes by killing all the men and selling the women into slavery and razing the town to the ground. But we are SHOWN Alexander crying over his Mom's mean words, and every decision he has to make, and the mercy killing of a mortally wounded soldier, and Jared Leto's smudged eyeliner, and the fact that Daddy has a new wife and baby and Mommy wants him to be king but stepmom and new baby are in the way and -- you get the picture. You never believe for a second that this creep is capable of anything like the ruthless actions history attributes to him -- he would be too busy holding little funerals for dead birds he found in the forest.

It is so bad that at the deathbed scene of Hephaistion, when Alexander turns away to the open window and delivers his ""moving"" soliloquy, imploring him not to die, with much drama and facial tickery (while behind him, unbeknownst to him, Hephaistion writhes about in his final throes and totally dies) the entire screening audience burst into laughter. It was hilarious. It was like a scene between Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The man is thrashing about dying on the bed and Colin Farrell, with a beatific, impassioned expression, is declaiming into the sunlight about how ""we'll grow old,"" [audience chuckles] ""and you'll take a wife"" [audience cackles knowingly] ""and our sons will play together -- like we did, Hephaistion!"" [audience is on the floor] ""And when we're old I will follow you to the underworld and we will be together forever, like my ancestor Achilles and Patroclus!"" He turns around and Hephaistion is stiff and grey with his eyes bulging out. [audience passes out from hyperventilation.]

Look: There are great stories, and there are stories that are merely okay, but work well according to their own rules -- they're not big test-of-time dramas, but they are seamless and of a piece unto themselves, thus worthwhile. ""Alexander"" doesn't even work as schlock. This film is making me reassess ""Gladiator."" Hell, it's making me reassess ""Hercules: the Legendary Journeys.""

This movie does nothing but TELL, from beginning -- where Anthony Hopkins as General Ptolemy narrating to some scribe says ""Alexander was a wonderful guy"" in as many different ways as he can squeeze into 15 minutes (that scroll he was fingering must have been a thesaurus) -- to end, where he pretty much does the same before he lies to the scribe about how Alexander died. (I didn't know that was a matter of scholarly contention but apparently it is, although why I'm even taking that much of this film seriously I do not know.) There is too much bloody talking in this film, and not enough of it makes any sense.

These people have chosen to illustrate the life of Alexander the GREAT without dramatizing ANY of the real-life battles or events that made him ""the great""! They showed every battle he lost, and every time his men were pissed at him, and every time he caved in to his Mommy, but anything heroic or grand in scale was narrated by Anthony Hopkins in VO over a closeup of Colin Farrell's incongruously crying face. (I'm still trying to figure out why they think it makes sense that the Persians he had just conquered in a bloody mess loved him so much, but Anthony Hopkins insists that ""Alexander was loved by all."") They didn't even show him giving a rousing pre-battle pep talk. OH my god, Gaugamela -- the first time in the film that he's out speaking to the troops, and the VO is ASSURING me that every-fecking-body just loved the hell out of Alexander, and we're supposed to be about to find out why -- I'm sitting there waiting for ""St. Crispin's Day"" and what does Stone give me? He takes the camera AND THE SOUND away from the speech and takes the audience up into a high CGI shot of the landscape and a bird. A BIRD? Cawing? This is inspiration? No, this is covering for lousy screenwriters. Holy sledgehammer: Eagles are cliche, but I've never seen one used that badly. Even Brad Pitt's two-second ""Troy"" speech was better. Two seconds! ""What awaits you on that beach? Immortality! Take it! It's yours!!!"" As opposed to the ten-minute ""Flight of the Eagle.""

It's not even a pretty movie. ""Troy"" at the very least had awesome, flowing, creative cinematography (and the short skirts on the men looked hot. In ""Alexander"" the short skirts look like diapers). Faces are lingered on for no real reason (they do this most often to the Persian king Darius, who also doesn't have a single line of dialogue). Alexander's fight scenes are choppy and impossible to follow -- they have neither the redeeming balletic quality of the choreographed battle scenes in ""Lord of the Rings,"" nor the redeeming gutsy realism of a ""Saving Private Ryan."" They are as confusing and bloody as a real battle, I imagine, but you are not made to care one whit what happens to these people -- it's like playing Resident Evil. Just fodder. You can't even readily distinguish the uniforms. A cockamamie, ugly red lens-wash over scenes substitutes for real drama, and the music is a far too jaunty trumpet-based thing -- triumphant even when the Greeks are losing.

And what am I to think of the editing when here you have Farrell standing in a completely different position and a different part of the room between camera cuts?  What I think is that the director takes his audience for slow-minded and unobservant.

And what was up with ""Tax Bill"" and the like written in ""Greek-looking"" English text during the ""now-let's-govern!"" montage?  What are we, ten?  Is this a cartoon?

There is an 8-year flashback about 45 minutes from the end of this 3-hour film. It is the only flashback in the whole film. It is also a very long flashback, and as a directorial decision it makes no sense. It's also rather important as it deals with the DEATH BY MURDER OF KING BLOODY PHILLIP. (That would be Alexander's DAD) Oh nevermind. It's exhausting trying to find sense in this thing.

It's a cliche to wish for a ""negative stars"" option on Amazon, but that is very much where I am right now.

As for me, I'm going to get ahold of ""Reign: The Conqueror"" to wash the taste out of my mouth. SOMEBODY's got to get it right.  Fingers crossed.

The fact that a movie was made about his life is by itself incredible. I saw the old movie of Alexander the Great performed by Richard Burton. By no means this version  is outstanding. It is a pity that critiques did not see the hard work of putting so much history in such a small amount of film time.

This movie should have been made as  mini series,with more of Hephastion's appearence since indeed he did have a very special place in Alexander's life, as well as the Persian Bagoas,which remained with Alexander until the end.

I loved the movie, as well as the costumes, and I think that Colin Farell and  Jared Leto(although he did have a small part),did show so much emotion. The music by Vangelis, was so well coordinated with the action of the film. Well done.",1130198400,9,885,4.569620253164557

2310397,3,B0009PLLN6,"Although there is no reason why you should not see Oliver Stone's Alexander, there is much reason to put it on the backburner until you see the other films of this director and its lead star, Collin Farrell, first. Alexander has a tendency to slip between horrible acting and grandeur epic battle scenes, to create an overall big budget mainstream movie with some low budget production values that should not be there. Still though, we get lots of Greek philosophy, pre-Christian bisexuality and the psychological infant and early adult Oedipus complex. It is all about chasing ideas, shaping our destinies and where the future may take us. Alexander's father, Philip, (Val Kilmer) is a stone cold warrior with no love. His mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is a manipulative power-hungry vixen. His love for both his parents plus his dreams turns him into a stone cold manipulative power-hungry day dreaming warrior who tries to conquer any kingdom that he can think off... and succeeds... for most of it. The power plays are quite interesting, including scenes where the son Alexander disobeys his father and almost creates an international incident because of it. There are those who want to share in Alexander's dreams, and even warriors who want to share his bed, creating an interesting complex story with people trying to reflect each other's qualities. However in directing a film more about Alexander the person than Alexander the Great, we get into trouble a bit because the acting is sketchy, even at the best of times. Performances let it down more than a tad.

The battle scenes are quite bloody with lots of CGI. Again this is certainly not the worst historical battler that you can see but it doesn't really turn out to be such a good one either. Some very nice production design values seem to save it from direct to video hell though. Interesting movie, grand in many parts, but like we said there are more than a few low budget production values that creep in where they should not.",1129680000,6,2000,4.865102639296188
2310398,4,B0009PLLN6,"This is an excellent movie - not exactly Lord of the Rings or Gladiator quality - but still excellent in it's own right.  The rumors that Alexander is portrayed as a homosexual in this film are true.  However, the one sex scen is heterosexual, and I got more of a bisexual impression.  It seems he was just a passionate man in general.  He passionately loved his mother, Hephaistion, his wife - Roxane (Rosario Dawson), and his horse.  Jared Leto does a particularly good job of protracted wistful gazes at Alexander.  The film focuses more on the personal life of Alexander than ""the Great"" part of his title.  It portrays him as a human being who fears, hurts, loves, etc.

The plot opens with Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) telling the tale after the death of Alexander.  He begins with a short review of Alexander's childhood and education, and the start of his relationship with Hephaistion (Jared Leto).  The plot jumps quickly to the first major battle that Alexander was in charge of.  The battle scenes are realistic & detailed.  Throughout Alexander's journey to the East, he struggles with his strange relationship with his mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie); the battle between his dream to reach the ocean & his soldiers' desire to go home; and his guilt over the murder of his father, Philip (Val Kilmer).

Angelina Jolie does an excellent job of playing Alexander's mother, however, the script shows her as very one dimensional.  She is portrayed as a very cold-hearted woman whose only desire is to see her son ascend to the throne.  I suspect there was more to the real historical Olympias.

The soundtrack could have been better.  It sounds similar to some of James Horner's work.  But, overall, it's a captivating film.",1129593600,3,1732,4.853242320819112
2310399,2,B0009PLLN6,"I've seen this movie awhile ago and must say that I was greatly dissapointing in my opinion when I watched it. The movie in my opinion was just plainly bland and rushed; with nothing much to savor. The movie did depict Alexander's life, showing that he was not perfect and gave information about his life. Though, I think they should have showed more of the conquest part, with only two epic battles; one at the begging of the movie against the mighty Persians, and one towards the end the bloody battle in the forests of India. Both of the battles though were shown in great detail, and were fun to watch. The movie did depict the hardship of the soldiers during the campaign, and showed hoe Alexander turned from a great leader into a self centering delusional person.

 The movie moved slower than I liked; and was mainly created for a History buff that knows a lot about this stuff. I myself love history, but let me tell you there is so much this movie failed to capture in my opinion. Anyways, like I said in the title this is kind of like a documentary you would usually see on the History Channel. The movie plainly went no where no where with the constant flash backs, and point where you when it seem that the movie would just take a nose drive. In, my opinion making the Director's Cut version made no actual difference, and couldn't seem to save this film. The movie is still respectable and very complex and detailed.

 I never really did get..... Why the heck Angelina Jolee played as Olympias (Alexander's Mother),.... I know this probably doesn't matter but really she had to be using about 5-6 different accents, I know since I speak a few different languages. It is just odd for Angelia Jolee to actually be Colin Farell's (Alexander) mother. They should have gotten someone older and more mature to play Olympias. Yes, Angelina Jolee is very sexy, but really why is she playing the part of Olympias, just stick with Tomb Raider. Colin Farrel did do a good job playing Alexander. I'm not sure he was maybe the best choice for the part but he delivered. (note:The real Alexander had Green Eyes Not Blue... just a fact though). Val Kimer did not do a good job as Philp(Alexander's dad), I don't know what to say. He just failed at the part doing absolutely horrible, shifting in and out with accents and expressions.... not acting well at all It was pretty suiting to have Anothny Hopkins as Ptolemy,... no complaints there. The acting led to a bit of a drawback to the movie barely being sub par,... but the constant flash backs and slowness of the movie slow it down.

 Oliver Stone, focused to much on Alexander's personality, and actually made him look like he is some crazy ruler, instead of one of the greatest rulers of all time. If Oliver Stone would have just added more info on Alexander's conquest. The movie did though make me look at Alexander the Great, in a different way. This movie basically showed that Alexander was human just like all of us. Making mistakes and having his own problems. So in a way you could say that the movie is somewhat intelligent, but I still wanted more action. This movie could have been a masterpiece, but the movie tells you a lot of stuff that you probably never heard about Alexander before. I myself know that Ancient Greeks pictured love in a different way; but still the whole bisexual Alexander kind of turned me off and ruined the rest of the movie. Look, I know it's meant to be historically accurate but, still Oliver Stone just got way to involved in that aspect; when he as a director should of focused on the conquest that actually made Alexander, ""Alexander The Great""!!!

 The film was just too boring and drawn out in my opinion, with nothing that impressed me except some cool visuals, that depicted cities like Babolyn to the forests of India, to the Hindu Kush mountains of Afganistan. Besides that the movie is something you may want to rent. This movie is mainly meant for a mature auidence, or History buffs like me. Hey when you see the 2 star rating, don't be fooled I still like the movie a little bit, but it just didn't capture Alexanders image correctly in my opinion. By, the way all that the Director's Cut adds is more graphic sexual content along with a few new special features. Really the Director' Cut is nothing special in my opinion, just see the threatical version.

 Overall, I will have to give this movie a 2.5/5

 I suggest you rent the movie, not entirely buy... unless you like the movie. I suggest you buy ""Troy"" or ""Kingdom of Heaven"" instead of ""Alexander"" though. This movie is sadly sub par, when it had the potential to be a masterpiece.",1129248000,5,4764,4.591283863368669
2310400,5,B0009PLLN6,"I refused to see the movie, having studied Alexander as a graduate student. I thought--Angelina Jolie as Olympias??? Give me a break. Val Kilmer as Philip? No way. Then, curiosity got the best of me and I bought the Director's cut DVD.

There were historical problems with the movie--but don't we all expect that going in to a ""film"" we know is not purposing to be an ""historical docu-drama""-- If you are looking for the historical Alexander, read Arrian or Plutarch or Diodorus. It you want a glimpse into an interpretation of an historical enigma, albeit romanticized and multi-culturalized in a modern way, then this movie is worth seeing.

Through reading Plutarch, I had envisioned the moment the young boy tamed his magnificent horse and there it was--come to life. I was moved. I thought Alexander's drunkeness and at times unexplained determination were believeable. His battles are studied even today. Look up Alexander the Great and you will find copious copy revolving around him.

And Angelina Jolie made a surprisingly awesome meddlesome and passionate mother. It makes it more understandable that a mother young enough to be her son's oldest sister, is actually his mother--Greeks/Macedonians married much younger women.

What about Alexander's sexual preferences? Reading the ancient sources certainly reveals some questions--and probably he found pleasure with certain men and women. So why are people offended that this film tried to reveal how Alexander's love life MAY have unfolded.

And finally, the film is criticized for being too long and too slow. I love Lord of the Rings, but there were moments those films dragged on at times. A story doesn't always have to race by to reveal itself. If you like battles, Greek mythology, curious about Alexander the Great, like to see the ancient world come to life? Then this film is worth the time.

In ""Gladiator"" the homosexual themes are largely sublimated in costumes and melodrama. In ""Troy"" the homosexuality is more openly displayed but never rises past the point of visual symbolism most of which centers around Brad Pitt's sword play, braided hair, or nude body. ""Alexander"", by contrast displays its homosexual themes openly and unapologetically. The dude is gay. Many men were in the Ancient Greek world and it didn't have the powerful political and cultural reverberations that it does today in Victorian America.

While I was happy that this film ""owned"" it's homosexuality more that the other two, I found it very boring. The dialog was trite and tiresome, the themes (as with any Oliver Stone movies) were flagrantly demonstrated and incredibly boring, and the actor who played Alexander was unbearably dull. In ""Gladiator"" Russle Crowe commanded the screen. No matter how goofy that movie got at times, Maxiums had my attention because Crowe played him beautifully. While ""Troy"" was not as good as Gladiatory, Brad Pitt played Achilles with all of his strengths mainly in the form of boyish attractiveness and athleticism. But ""Alexander""--oh man--dull, dull, dull.

Alexander was one of the greatest military figures ever, so if someone had made this movie like Kingdom of Heaven or Gladiator, it could have been a great movie. Sadly it was turned into a historically incorrect, political piece that was slanted more towards todays issues with homosexuality than the historical issues of the movie. While the Battle of the Granicus was well represented, the Battle of the Hydaspes was one of the worst represented battles of movie history. The movie would make it seem like a terriable fight, while, in fact, it was a rout of the Indian army, who lost over 20,000 men, while the Greeks lost only 1,000. Also, Alexander was wounded at the Hydaspes in the movie, when he was actually wounded during a small battle with the Malli tribe in India, after the Battle of the Hydaspes. Other than those problems though, this movie concentrated on his personal life too much, it was more of a soap opera than a movie about a historical figure.",1128902400,5,1029,4.65934065934066
2310405,2,B0009PLLN6,"First of all, I wasn't expecting very much from this movie. I just thought it would be mildly entertaining, like Troy, or Charlie's Angels, or any one of the James Bond movies. Not life changing, but entertaining. Indeed, all I was looking for was a shallow action movie. Now, I have no idea how they managed to do it with a perfectly good action movie topic like Alexander the Great, but it was incredibley boring.

First of all, the dialogue is awful. And when I say awful, I mean AWFUL. Why is it awful, that's kind of hard to describe. People just randomly arguing with eachother every second for no reason in particular except to add to the drama. As well as this, everything sounds incredibly awkward. no matter what the context. It's strange that in any James Bond film, M can say to Bond that he needs to kill so and so or else the White House will get nuked and make it sound just fine when Alexander can't say ""I wanna conquer India"" without sounding like a socially awkward teenager. The acting sucks too, but even an Oscar winning actor would sound awful with this script.

Second of all, the plot is unbearably slow. Battle scenes seldom occur, and basically nothing happens. He gets married, there are flashbacks that show when his dad was killed, he argues with his troops, nothing all that exciting. Normally I wouldn't mind bad dialogue and acting in this sort of a film if there were good battles, but there aren't any. As opposed to dramatically conquering India or any other place, it just has the narrator say so instead of it actually being shown.

If you want a fun action movie, don't waste your time on this, there are plenty of other options.",1128902400,9,1668,4.534883720930233
2310406,3,B0009PLLN6,"Come on, folks, show some respect for eccentric overambition and reckless overreach.  (Sort of like Alexander himself.)  Yes, the movie is kind of, um, problematic; but it's a noble failure, a courageous train-wreck, and it has some fine things in it.  Give it credit for sheer nerve.

I don't know why everyone is complaining about Angelina Jolie's zany Russian accent: I thought it was a daring choice (and I could understand why she did it); her performance was big and smart, and pretty remarkable.  And plus, it was just such a darn corker, I couldn't help applauding.  (It made me nostalgic for Priscilla Smith's legendary turn as Medea at the La Mama theatre in New York.)  When people take chances this huge, yes, they risk falling on their face; but I'd rather see an artist take a chance and fail, than play it safe and be dull.  Granted, this is not a straight-up-the-middle ""good"" movie, but I'm glad somebody made a big-budget movie that wasn't.  I'd rather watch this sort of weirdness than ""Gladiator,"" even though ""Gladiator"" is more of what you'd call a good job.

There's good mixed in with bad here, and if you forget trying to make ""good sense"" of the whole thing, and just enjoy the strange details, it's sort of rewarding.  The one thing I wish is that the filmmakers had gotten it a bit more clear in their heads exactly WHY they were making this thing.  The story is so huge and convulsive, it's difficult to make much sense out of it as a ""story,"" and a lot of the leaden excuses Alex & Co. make about 'accepting other cultures' and 'liberating' people seemed unconvincing.  Was there some allegorical message I was supposed to be clued in on?  Or political sarcasm?  A veiled critique of Mr. Bush's misadventures in the Mideast?  We'll never know.

But it's almost better that way.  Bottom line: if you want to be ""entertained,"" you probably won't be.  If you want an edifying artistic or historical experience, nope, you're out of luck there, too.  What you WILL get is a kind of top-notch, expensive, high-quality daffiness.

Over the top violence, stop spearing the horse already.  Ridiculous accents by everyone involved including Jolie.  Oliver Stone needs to get a grip or an editor for his screenplays.  This one was terribly disjointed and very confusing.  The viewer doesn't even like Alexander or anyone else.  Nothing compelling in the film whatsoever.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

This was such a bad movie. I wanted to like it, I love the Alexander legends! But it was so sadly poor to be almost pathetic. Angelia Jolie was an utter wooden disaster in her role.  The movie just didn't hang together and the character relationships were lacking. It wasn't at all the rousing epic it was supposed to be.

Collin Farrell is cast as Alexander.  His acting is fine, if not exceptional.  But the material he has to work with is awful.  First of all, Angelina Jolie just isn't convincing as Alexander's mother.  Second of all, there is an overriding theme of Alexander and his male companion, Jarad Leto, having an intimate relationship.  This is only hinted at however and as far as romantic scenes are concerned, a lot more time is given to Alexander and Rosario Dawson, cast as his wife, Roxanne.

The film is full of pomp and wise old men, such as Anthony Hopkins, cast as Aristotle, saying wise things.  Naturally, there are a lot of long and boring battle scenes.  And, worst of all, the film is almost three full hours long.

2310411,3,B0009PLLN6,"I just recently was able to get my hands on Alexander, and I sat down and joyfully began watching the movie. But, I soon noticed that something was terribly wrong. Every person in the movie, dubbed as ""Persians"" had some kind of British accent, whether it was Irish or English, it doesn't matter. Alexander's mother (played by Jolie) had her own accent from somewhere in the vicinity of Russia. Although the misplaced accents marred much of the movie, I forced myself to push them aside, and to try to enjoy the movie. When the first battle was about to begin, I noticed that something else was very wrong. The musical score that was supposed to have been created for this movie did not follow the battle at all. In such a battle as it was, the music should have been behind the sound effects, but instead it just drowns them out. The battle was very chaotic and hard to follow, which made it very realistic for me. Now I know many people may be angry about how difficult it was to follow the battle, but I have to say that in real life, no battle is ever easy to follow.

Soon you'll realize that the movie is jumping back and forth. This, I think, was the movie's greatest flaw. It made the storyline more confusing and hard to follow than it already was. I love history movie, so I think that the political parts of this movie needed to be there, but if you are a standard movie goer the politics get very confusing and are unnecessary.

Putting aside all of these shortcomings of Alexander, at some point during the 3 hour movie you get a bit attached to Alexander. I started to hate him for what he did to his troops, making them push on against there will. Alexander gets routed in India, and you are just as disappointed as he is. After this a few more things happen that help lead to Alexander's end, but, I think that the end of the movie made the 3 hours worth the wait.

2310412,3,B0009PLLN6,"The critics of this film have one agenda - the obvious dislike for Alexader's sexuality.  How could Oliver Stone make a true film without including the Bisexual nature of Alexander The Great - you people need to read your history and remember that this was PRE-CHRISTIANITY and homosexuality was prevelant and normal in Greek Society in Alexander's time.  Infact it was common for men to lie with men and have wives for procreation.  This is the problem with our 'Limited View"" of sexuality and the fear behind it.  Infact the flaw I find in Stone's Direction of this aspect of the film is that he did not go all the way with Alexander's Sexuality.  A love scene with Hephaestion as steamy as Rosario's would have been Oscar worthy for pushing the envelope and 'us homosexuals' would have had some great eroticism.  Most of the negative reviews of this film center on Alexander's bisexuality - it must payne all you 'red blooded, God fearing, Christian Men"" to know that one of the greatest military conquerers of all time liked the 'boys'.  You biggots seriously need to just come out already - sleep with a male friend - you'll feel so much better.",1128470400,5,1150,4.691542288557214
2310413,2,B0009PLLN6,"The theatrical version of Alexander is not the total disaster it's been painted, more an interesting failure with moments that aspire to greatness nestled amid others that look too much like a Hallmark miniseries for comfort. Unfortunately, it lacks a particularly good script: indeed, where there's overlap between them, Robert Rossen's somewhat underfunded 1955 film dealt with key events much more dramatically and without recoursing to excessive narration to fill in the gaps. What it lacks even more is a real star as Alexander, a part that requires either great screen presence or a great actor. Sadly the blandly inoffensive Colin Farrell is neither. He tries hard (which is much more than can be said for Clive Owen in King Arthur) and he's almost convincing in the two action scenes, but he never sells you as an extraordinary man people will follow across the known world.

And then, of course, there's the supporting cast, Val Kilmer occasionally channelling Robert Newton's Long John Silver, Angelina Jolie coming across like Irene Papas on steroids (not to mention with added collagen) and Anthony Hopkins looking for another bit of scenery to chew on. (On a purely trivial note it's strange to note how much Rory McCann looks like either a young Sean Connery or a middle-aged Victor Argo depending on what angle he's photographed from.) Although there's a method to his madness, it's hard not to think Stone is taking the Mick with all the Celtic accents and at times its surprisingly difficult to decipher what is being said, more because of mumbling and slurred pronunciation than the regional dialect, to be fair.

There's intelligence at work here, as witnessed by the cave scene where the terrible price of greatness among the mythological heroes Alexander idolises is outlined, but often more in intent than execution. When it does work, it works well - the bloody battle of Guagamela seen intermittently from an eagle's eye view, the scenes in a gorgeously realized Babylon - but all too often there's too little of what made Alexander great. Indeed, there's too little of everything despite its running time. Relationships aren't convincingly sketched out and the big dramatic scenes are clumsily executed and emotionally uninvolving: his scenes with his mother or the fatal argument with Cleitus just show up the inadequacies of the cast and lack power or focus. Stone's tendency to idealize Alexander doesn't help, even if his script acknowledges the fact. For all his talk of being driven by a dream, it's never really communicated what that dream was beyond a desire for personal glory and a place among the immortals, nor does he deal with the fact that Alexander left no legacy but chaos. As a result, the last hour, when things start to go bad for Al, gets duller than it needs to be. Still, Vangelis' score is excellent

It's strange that so many American critics focused on the bisexuality: in truth, it's one of the LEAST gay sword-and-sandals epics, simply avoiding all the euphemisms to deal with it head-on. That said, I could have done without Farrell flittering his eyelids like a little girl ever time he's with Hephaistion.",1128470400,8,3162,4.996204933586338

2310415,4,B0009PLLN6,"OK, I admit it. I watched the DVD only because I was curious after reading the really awful reviews elsewhere. I had just watched the other one, with Richard Burton, made back in the 50's (I think) and everyone waxes lyrical about it. Ick. It was really inaccurate about a many, many things and it was just a so-so sword and sandal epic. It didn't mention Hephaistion, who was a huge part of Alexander's life, it didn't show any of the invation of India, and Richard Burton's huffing and snorting and super-Elizabethan way of speaking were just plain irritating, not to mention the silly looking wig that looked as if it might fall off.

In comparison, this new film fared pretty well, imho. I wish Stone *hadn't* cut back on the gay content (and no, I'm not gay) but having read Mary Renault's books, I think Alexander was either gay or bi. I wish, however, that Stone had left out Boagas, who really was just *there* like a piece of furniture and didn't move the story along. And unless the viewer had read The Persian Boy, s/he wouldn't have had a clue who Boagas was. But Hephaistion was important. He was a general, Alexander's beloved friend, and a hero. So what's wrong with having a gay or bi character who is courageous?? When Hephaistion died Alexander pretty much lost it.

Only three things really bugged me about the film: Angelina Jolie's collagen-filled lips which seemed to fill the screen whenever she was on, the unexplained and unnecessary appearance of the eunuch Boagas, and all the crying Alexander and Hephaistion did. And Jared Leto was way too pretty for the part of Hephaistion; he always looked as if Captain Jack Sparrow had done his eye makeup. I sometimes had trouble telling him from the actor who played the pretty eunuch. I adore sensitive men, but Oliver Stone apparently didn't realize that emotion showing just below the surface is more effective than when it spills over into weeping. Less is more, Oliver.

I absolutely love historical epics and have never cared how much or little they follow the written history we all know and have heard (I'm an archaeologist... I tend NOT to believe written histories all the time anyway ;))

But when I got this movie, I kept watching and watching and I just CAN'T seem to figure out what everyone hated about it...  I can understand some homophobes may have issues with this film as it does portray Alexander as bisexual, but in my opinion, that's their own problem and they should either get over it or stop whining...  But as for everyone else, I was expecting some awful acting or a ridiculous story or just nothing but sex and violence... or, well, ANYTHING... and for the life of me I just can't figure out why so many people hated it.

Sure, this isn't THE best movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly nowhere NEAR the worst.  With strong emotions, a dark and gritty plot, and very tragic story, I know I for one didn't finish the movie wanting my two hours back.

Although the time jumps and flashbacks are a bit distracting and confusing at first, and it is a bit, well, muddy (for lack of a better term) from fitting so much into two hours, it really IS a good movie, and I don't regret buying it or watching it.

So my advice with this movie... go in with an open mind, DON'T listen the critics all the time, and don't hate a movie just because everyone else does.  If you can do that, and you love this genre as much as I do, I think you'll really enjoy this movie :)",1128211200,4,1623,4.281045751633987

2310420,5,B0009PLLN6,"A prompt check on the online encyclopaedia website, Wikipedia, states that Alexander the Great (Megas Alexandros in Greek)was born in late July. That would make him a Leo.

As a fellow Leo, I could relate to his ambitions and his fiery passions. Not to mention his zest for life. In astrological terms, the Leo zodiac is governed by the sun, thus philosophically speaking, Alexander is driven by fire. No doubt there are also many references made during the course of the movie in regards to the looking towards the sky, thus the sun.

Already, it was stated in the movie by old Ptlomey (played with reverence by Anthony Hopkins) that Alexander ""the Great"" does not exist. The historians (particularly the Greek ones)idolised him. Made him more than a man. They made him a demi-god who will be passed into legends and myths like those of Herakles and Achilles.

For a more contemporary, but not really reliable, biographical point of view, Plutarch's works would be the one to go for. But, as for now, Oliver Stone's admirable film would do. What I do not get is that why Americans are not susceptible to such films? As Stone mentioned in his commentary, he suspected that the American audiences didn't like ""teaching"" movies, and he modified the Aristotle tutoring scene. At the same time, he also stated that the audiences could not count the years in B.C.

However, such facts are trivial. Stone's film did not really do justice over the towering achievements of Alexander. However, he did get some things right. For instance, Alexander's world view that all races and countries can be united under one system (be it language, governance, education, military, etc.) That point is admirable, let alone, an ancient conqueror could have dreamt up of such often lofty, ideal, but yet ultimately un-Platonic or even anti-Aristotle.",1128038400,,1829,4.947882736156352

Three hours I thought, well let's hope it's an exciting three hours! Because there have been historic films that were exciting, and the hours did just whiz by. Yet this film dragged...and dragged. Whoever directed this movie didn't get the whole point of Alexander. Alexander was one of the most exiciting men to ever live, or so it was in written texts. Now I don't know how he truly was, but written wise he did not sit around whining about how his drunken father and controlling mother hated him for at least one whole hour of the film. I wanted to see him away from home, I wanted to see him travel and I wanted him to fight his battles. That is the whole excitement of a historic film correct?
You hardly get this. The battles are mainly cut short so he can continue to look back and see how his mother and father scarred him for life basically and so he can continue to weep and supposedly be torn over his bisexuality. It was all right if once or twice they hinted at this, but they continued to push and push the gay card and it got annoying. Yes, we get it, he and his companion were close, I don't know how close exactly, and could have cared less. But I wish they would have given his wife a little more strength in the film, even if he was gay and liked his companion more, his wife was still very important you know. They gave his mother more strength which kind of makes Alexander seem like a mama's boy and weakens the character ever more. They made Alexander seem more like a lover than a warrior, and that cuts me off the film because my god, everyone makes him as a great warrior and this movie well softened him. A lot. I didn't see him as no warrior in this film.
What should they have done? Well in my opinion, more battle scenes, less mother scenes (she can really get on your nerves), more wife scenes, less flash back scenes, and more, definitely more scenes where Alexander shows his true self, the selfish and anger- ridden warrior that was known and how the others contended with it. They only showed the true Alexander once and awhile and it made no sense. You cannot change from angry warrior to a soft- ridden poet who only wants to be loved. And I think others agree we wanted to see the warrior instead, or at least a lot more than we did.

This movie is disappointing, one of the weakest historic films I have seen and also one of the most boring. The movie probably would have been better if they cut back a lot of the scenes unnecessary and made the film shorter and more to the point. They didn't though, so thus they lose major points to me. This will not be in my DVD collection.",1127606400,6,2748,4.254302103250478
2310423,4,B0009PLLN6,"When you attempt to appease and please the homophobes and the average movie goer you're going to ruin a good thing, if it was a good thing to begin with.

I would have chosen a different actor to play Alexander. Colin didn't have the 'presence' of what one would imagine Alexander to have had. With that said, Alexander might have been more like this portrayal than one might suppose. For the temperament of the historical Alexander probably had a more sensitive side than his warrior legend would imply. So I kind of went with this perspective of Alexander.

Perhaps 2005 America still isn't ready for more intimate scenes between two men, but Alexander surely was. And this film was suppose to be about Alexander the Great and not the masses who blush when two men entangle in the most natural acts known to humanity. So I think Oliver Stone is both brilliant and a coward. I really enjoyed the movie but it should have gone all the way. I don't get off on $*** films but I do appreciate authenticity and being truly human. I'm bored to death with the peek-a-boo let's pretend we're really not so down and dirty creatures who need to love and lust each other.

2310426,4,B0009PLLN6,"When I heard Oliver Stone was going to direct a movie about the life of Alexander the Great, I was not optimistic. I thought it would be full of Hollywood tripe. For those of you who either don't know or don't want to admit the facts, Alexander the Great was an incredibly tough homosexual man who conquored most of the known world during his time. He was an amazing man who overthrew wicked dicators much more bloodthirsty than he was, and he brought peace and prosperity to much of his lands for a time.

The fact he was a homosexual is VERY important...because his most elite army was also homosexual. The bonds and love and lust and life these men shared helped lead them to their victories. Oliver Stone did a superb job in portraying Alexander as 'bisexual', which is ok, because Alexander as King did have an obligation to marry and procreate. And I'm sure he loved his wife, but not in the same way he loved his life partner, best friend, and male lover, Hephaestion. Stone did a remarkable job in helping to bring this love into the light.

Apart from Alexander's sexuality, there is a wealth of characters and influences and causes and passions surrounding his life which do make a very compelling story. This is a wonderful movie, tasteful and extremely well done. Yes, it could have been better...and it might be boring to homophobes who can't get over historical fact.

And yes he toned down the ""gayness"" a little, although the 2 big scenses he left in.

It had a gutsy,bang up director, a hunky leading man, an academy award winning actress,a great big budget and all the magic available to filmakers today. It also had the story of one of the most fascinating men in history pre-written for it. So,how did it end up being a three hour dud?

The acting has a lot to do with it. Ferrell just doesn't have the power and charisma to pull off Alexander the Great. His ""stirring"" speeches to his troops aren't all that stirring. Mel Gibson (Braveheart) he ain't. I wouldn't follow this guy to the state line, let alone to the ends of the Earth. Stone replaces good acting with drawn out shots of Ferrell's face or soulfull dark eyes. It doesn't work. Ferrell may not deserve all the blame, he didn't have all that great a script to work with.

Angelina Jolie could have phoned this one in.

she is down right laughable as Alexander's mom, Olympias. Her acting is limited to squinting and hissing her lines. She really had no clue where to go with this part. There is no evidence of any real affection for her son. Her accent( what I would call ancient Vampira) is awful. Has the woman ever actually heard a Greek accent?

Jared Leto as Hepaistion is vapid at best. Lets leave it at that.

I was never able to really connect with any character. You simply do not give a darn what happens to these people. That may well be the films greatest weakness. The depth of the relationship with Hephaistion is never truly explored. The -were they or were they not- aside, an incredible bond of friendship existed between these two men. Historical sources tell us that after Hephaistion's death, Alexander locked himself away and mourned without food and water for many days. He began to decline, and never recovered. This film does not show that kind of passionate devotion. This was probably the single most important relationship in Alexander's life, and Stone's film glosses over it.

The film does have a few good points. The cinematography and costuming are wonderful. The battle scenes are big and gory, as warfare in that time most surely was. There is a good feel for time and place. Sadly,though, you simply do not ever get any sense of what made Alexander great.",1127001600,9,2242,4.6206030150753765
2310430,2,B0009PLLN6,"The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, ""A man's character is his destiny.""  The greatest problem with  Oliver Stone's movie Alexander is that he failed to motivate Alexander in a way that explains his greatness.

In the movie, Alexander is repulsed by his mother who killed his father, Philip of Macedon.  This causes him to become homosexual and to leave Greece on a conquoring rampage.

All Alexander had to do to fulfill his destiny, by this definition, is to leave his mother's side.  That does not explain what motivated him to lead the largest army in the ancient world half way to China.  It does not explain how he motived his men to fight for him for so long.  It does not touch on his genius for conquoring people in foreign lands.

In short, it does not explain anything that made him great.

The other flaw in Alexander is that the movie has too many flashbacks.  They see-saw back and forth confusingly, and the narrator does not clearly explain what each segment adds to the main story.

This minor technical irritation could be overcome if the basic psychological motivation for Alexander's greatness was correctly presented.  A confused mama's boy doesn't conquor the world without having something else to offer.",1127001600,7,1229,4.879227053140097

2310434,4,B0009PLLN6,"I really enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". I think it's a fine film. There are some very well filmed segments in this movie. Overall, it may not end up being seen as a filmatic masterpiece, but there are portions of this movie that are very good.

I particularly liked the scene of Aristotle teaching the young Macedonian boys geography. It's a well acted scene. Both the aged Aristotle and the child actors do a fine job. If you listen close, the lecture that Aristotle gives is politically-incorrect by today's standards. A lesser film would have shied away from this and either not shown such sentiments, or toned them down somewhat, but let's be honest, Aristotle was politically-incorrect by today's values and this film does a good job in portraying historical accuracy, not revisionist history.

I think Alexander's tirade about the Macedonian generals' show of contempt for a world ""far older than their's"" is kind of wishful thinking on Oliver Stone's part however. I'm sure the historical Alexander, (as a Greek speaking man), would have felt himself quite superior to Asiatic cultures and peoples.

The actual battle(s) over India are also incorrect in that in reality the Macedonians were not massacred by the Indians as shown in the film, but rather could have probably conquered all of India had they continued. The breakdown of morale in the commanding general staff is shown in the film as taking place before the Indian invasion when indeed this happened well within India at a later time. Alexander only ""lost"" when his generals refused to carry on eastward. If he was ever defeated, it was only by low internal morale amongst his own troops. For some reason that escapes historic accuracy, Oliver Stone makes the Indians in his film far stronger a foe than they were in history.

Other than these few historical flaws, the film is quite good by modern standards. The dance of Roxanne in Bactria is a quite erotic and passionately filmed sequence. The confused sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaistion is also quite convincing and well acted onscreen.

The musical score by Vangelis is haunting and beautiful, as are all of his scores.

At first, I had my doubts about Collin Farrell in the lead role, but he's convincing as Alexander. Also, children who play the young character in a film rarely seem like they'd grow up into the actors that play the same character as an adult. Case in point, the young 9-year-old boy Anakin Skywalker of ""Phantom Menace"" does not at all seem that he would grow into the Anakin that we see in Episodes II and III of the Star Wars Saga. In Alexander, the boy Alexander actually seems plausible that he'd grow into Collin Farrell as an adult.",1126828800,6,2703,4.8652173913043475

  First of all, I can not believe Oliver Stone directed this film.  Some of his other films had those choppy, quick frames and the hand-held moving camcorder effect I do not care for.

  The Director's Cut includes violent scenes, sexual scenes of man/woman, male and female nudity and scenes that imply bisexuality.  I have read their were several scenes of nudity and bisexuality in the theatrical version that will not be seen in this Director's Cut DVD version due to the fact Oliver Stone cut the scenes out.

 The story begins at 323 B.C. at the death of Alexander. The story forwards 40 years later as Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) tells us the story of Alexander starting back to 331 B.C. in Gaugamela, Persia.
 As an adult, Alexander and his war men battle and conquer the Persian Empire.
 This epic story explores his time with his mother, the death of his father leading to Alexander becoming King.
  We see Alexander and his love for two men, Hephaistion (Jared Leto) and Bagoas (Francisco Bosch) and his relationship with Roxane (Rosario Dawson).

2310437,5,B0009PLLN6,"People who claim this movie is a disappointment are probably expecting a superficial cartoon-like epic such as Troy or Gladiator. This movie on the other hand does not have a simple story.

It presents a new take on plausible events in the life of Alexander the great, conveying his dreams and ideas. The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie. The visuals of the movie are absolutely amazing. The Battle scenes with Darius are very well done and the battle in India conveys so much power. I would have liked to get a little bit more insight into the Persian Empire. To know better the allies Alexander made among them. But to go into this other dimension in an already 3-hour long film would be asking for too much. Hopefully some future DVD version will include these extra scenes :) In summary I found this movie the best I have seen among the movies based on Ancient Greece or Rome. A definitively must see for Oliver Stone fans and for history enthusiasts.

The additional footage between Alexander and Olympias, just after Philip's assassination, was a big boost to the film -- really adding a more conflicted dimension to their relationship, which seemed justified.  I would like also to have seen more of Darius, and his position... as it stands, one can't consider someone known as the Great King being so easily dethroned, and with such simplicity.  Of course, I guess I'm asking for two more hours of film.  However, if they were as good as the rest, I'd be happy to see it.  No sense to run on and on.

Granted this is not the best movie of all time nor is it the worst. All the actors did a fine job and Oliver Stone did his best to interpret the story.

Unfortunately, there were no video cameras or film camera back in ancient times, so we have to take the facts that we are given and interpret them as best we can. The movie does seem to focus on too many things to keep the common mans interest really peeked.

My minor in college was ancient history and while I am no expert by any means, I believe they did as well a job as Hollywood can do with the historical accuracies, yes there are a few things that are not as accurate as they can be; this is a movie produced my hollywood, not a biography from the history channel.

2310444,5,B0009PLLN6,"This movie is taking a lot of heavy hits because it isn't just like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"". Well, it wasn't intended to be a film of that type (despite spectacular battle sequences, the best I've ever seen). It is more in the style of ""My Dinner With Andre"", and I'm sure if I read the user reviews of that movie, I wouldn't find many that said ""Talk! Talk! Talk! Talk! Where are all the battle scenes?""

""Alexander"" is a meditative movie, dominated by monologue and dialogue, punctuated with scenes of tremendous natural beauty, sexual passion, extravagant opulence and decadence, and battle scenes of unparalleled intensity. I am convinced that the two battles in ""Alexander"" have such a compelling dream/nightmare character because of Oliver Stone's experiences in Vietnam. There is absolutely no similarity between these battles and the fairly orderly battle between the Romans and the Germans in ""Gladiator"". Many reviewers wrote that the battle scenes are very confusing. That's the whole point ! They are nightmares, because war is literally hell. I have addressed the bi-sexual issue in a previous review of ""Alexander"". But of course one will not find accurate history in this movie. The real Philip, Alexander's father, could speak as eloquently and in as learned a manner as any of the philosophers of his day, so the ancient Greek historian Plutarch wrote, although you'd never know that from Val Kilmer's portrayal of him. As for Alexander himself, the movie does not present him as he really was most of the time: very restrained and disciplined, even ascetic with regard to the pleasures of the flesh. Plutrch wrote: ""He had no desire to inherit a kingdom which offered him riches, luxuries and the pleasures of the senses: his choice was a life of struggle, of wars, and of unrelenting ambition...

At any rate Alexander, so it seems, thought it more worthy of a king to subdue his own passions than to conquer his enemies, and so he never came near these women (female relatives of Darius whom Alexander the Great had captured and then cared for and protected with great chivalry), nor did he associate with any other before marriage, with the exception only of Barsine... As for the other prisoners, when Alexander saw their handsome and stately appearance, he took no more notice of them than to say jokingly, 'These Persian women are a torment for our eyes' (because they incite the body to rebel against the discipline of the will).""

Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and snakes..... Here Oliver Stone took one detail of the real Olympias' life and magnified it to fill her entire life in the film. Plutarch wrote: ""At another time a serpent was seen stretched out at Olympias' side as she slept...It appears that from very ancient times all women of this region have been initiates of the Orphic religion and the orgiastic rites of Dionysus...extravagant and superstitious ceremonies. It was Olympias' habit to enter into these states of possession and surrender herself to the inspiration of the god with even wilder abandon than the others, and she would introduce into the festal procession numbers of large snakes, hand-tamed, which terrified the male spectators..."" That's it. That's all there was to it. It wasn't anything sexual or Freudian. It was just part of her occasional religious observances.

If Stone had made a film about, say, Winston Churchill, and he showed Churchill's wife constantly singing religious hymns and bowing her head in prayer and kneeling and reciting religious sermons and sprinkling holy water and incense everywhere and at all hours of the day and night, just because in real life she attended church services every Sunday, you can see how ridiculous it was for Stone to portray Olympias constantly covered with snakes even while relaxing in her own home !

The eagle symbol has come in for unjust critical bashing, because modern audiences have no idea what a mighty significance most ancient Greeks attached to ""bird signs"". (Not all Greeks; Euripides called it ""sheer folly"" to pay attention to them). The ancient Greek mind was enthralled by mighty birds of prey, and attached a mystical significance to them. In Homer's Iliad there is a famous scene where two warriors are on a dangerous mission. Suddenly an eagle appears above them, and they know then that Zeus had approved their mission. The Greek army at Troy actually contained men whose sole function was to interpret ""bird signs"" ! Of course it would be very odd and humorous if a young man or woman walked into a modern American Army recruitment office and announced that he or she wanted to specialize in computers, medical technology, and ""bird signs"". The modern mind cannot appreciate what this meant to the Greeks. So keep that in mind as you read all the mocking comments like ""What's up with that eagle ???"".

As I said, this is a thinking person's film, like ""My Dinner With Andre"", combined with certain other elements. It is not really an action flick. Lastly, accents.... You hear this strange criticism again and again and again. ""Why did they have Irish accents or English accents or Scottish accents ? They should have had Greek accents..."" This is a very foolish criticism. The Greeks and Macedonians of that day did not speak ""Greek-accented English"". They spoke Greek. Unless you want the actors in this film to speak in the Greek language (and Colin Farrell would still have an Irish accent if he did !!), with distracting subtitles popping up on the screen, just suspend disbelief about the accents, as you suspend disbelief that the Battle of Gaugamela only lasted 10 minutes and that Alexander conquered the known world in three hours.

The film, contrary to what some reviewers might imagine, is not remotely 'accurate', unless one believes that mosaic maps of the world in Hellenic/Hellenistic times were labelled in LATIN (yes, I kid you not!). The set decor is, perhaps, 'reasonably accurate', but I can't really extend any more plaudits to the film. Production values are murky; acting is overwrought and leaden--a notable feat, but accomplished to perfection here. For anyone not familiar with the course of Alexander's career, the plot will be nearly impenetrable, even with Anthony Hopkins' voiceover commentary.

The key battle at Gaugamela/Arbela is, to be polite, woefully inaccurate; Kleitos is apparently despatched in India, rather than near Marakanda; Bucephalus dies in battle with an elephant...etc, etc.

There were several places where it starts on a tangent and then just stops and goes back and nothing else is said about it.  In other places it goes ahead and takes the tangent and doesn't achieve anything by including the tangent.  This motion picture, needed to be extensively redone mainly to give it some continuity and also to take out alot  of the unnecessary gay sex things and other type parts of the story that should never have been presented in this type of film.

2310454,1,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander, Oliver Stone's contribution to the resurrected genre of sword-and-sandal epics, is a clear demonstration that you can make a movie that looks like it should be great and utterly fail.  This biopic of Alexander the Great flounders on almost every level and is probably most notable for making the overblown Troy seem good in comparison.

Any scrutiny as to why this movie fails must begin with Colin Farrell who plays the title character.  Farrell, in the right context, is a decent enough actor, but he's out of his element here.  He is supposed to play a great leader, but is not believable in his role.  When Russell Crowe inspires his troops in Gladiator, we believe he's a good general; when Farrell does it in this movie, the only thing I'm inspired to do is eject the DVD (but somehow I resisted and stuck with the film to the end).  It is impossible to accept that this is a man who could command any real loyalty.

Stone's direction is mediocre.  The battle sequences are not all that entertaining and his attempts to be ""artistic"" come off as merely pretentious.  With the sole exception of Val Kilmer, all the actors are either chewing the scenery (such as Angelina Jolie) or underdeveloped.  Unfortunately, Kilmer's decent performance is far from enough to carry this movie.

At least a film like XXX - State of the Union doesn't pretend to be great, so when it fails, we're not all that disappointed.  Not so, here.  There is undoubtedly a good movie that could be made out of the life of Alexander the Great.  It hasn't arrived yet.  If it were a film of normal length, it might be worth viewing just to see how bad it is, but at three hours, it's probably better to skip it and watch another, shorter bad movie instead.  You'll still have wasted your time, but at least you'll have wasted less of it.",1125792000,7,1825,4.58641975308642
2310455,1,B0009PLLN6,"Where do I begin?

First off, youll just begin to get into a scene, when it seems practically mid-sentence, something like ""20 years earlier"" pops up.

Further, it seems people growing up in the same country manage to have totally different accents.

Even further, if youll remember my first comment on the time jumping through the movie, it seems Angelina dosnt age. Ten years, seven years, still hot. And on that subject, shes a bit young and attractive to be his mom.

This far in the movie, you think to yourself ""at least it couldn't get any worse"", and thats when Collin's belt seems to break, as his toga comes off, revealing a very naked Alexander. Being the straight guy that I am, this was a little gross when you see a bit of his front as well.

And then he gets in bed...with a guy. Now up to this point, I thought he was married. to a girl. Apparenlty not.

after another hour and a half or so, I find this film dosnt seem to be moving along. Actually come to think of it, it started becoming boring about thirty minutes in.

I didn't beleive the bad reveiws on Troy and I was extremly happy when I saw it a classic reborn with a new twist and a new generation of actors that climb to rival the old generation of stars from the 50s and 60s. When I watched Alerxander my hopes were crushed. The actors did their best with the material they had but I beleive the story was too convoluted and kept jumping from future to past and present too much. The story line was hard to follow and instead of keeping the story linear it was just too confusing. The battle scenes while acted and performed well were just as hard to follow. In my humble opinion I would pass on this movie. If you like period peices from mytho9logy I would suggest Gladiator or Troy.",1125619200,4,979,4.240641711229946
2310457,2,B0009PLLN6,"You know that time of your life when you're at a pool. You're watching the kids, her kids, grand kids, your kids. Kids. And one of them, very dry and as yet unimmersed, goes up to Mom and says, ""Mom, how do I dive into the water?"" And she says 'honey, you have to get wet first. Go on. Jump in the pool.'

OK. Granted it's kind of a stretch but stay with me. Alexander's bisexualty. Oliver. Do it or don't. Pained stares, lots of mascara and 12-step hugs don't do it. It's almost 2006.

Stone does great work and like successful directors in a whimsical industry, success is sometimed marred by failure. Or worse, mediocrity. Wall Street, Platoon, 4th of July, Nixon, are juxtaposed against JFK and Heaven and Earth. And one thing's for certain. Alexander ain't great and it might be in the latter category. It seems there might have been some areas that could have been avoided.

You know I don't think the bisexualty issue is a big deal but you have to admit, it's a hot topic. It's kind of like gay marriages in the last election. It's bound to attract a stream of negativity. It's a lightening rod. I believe that from an accuracy point of view, it's really hard to say what a person's sexualty is now, much less 2000 years ago. Hell. We don't even know what Bubba's sexuality was. How are we supposed to know Alexander's?

And then there's that 'one foot in the water one foot out' approach. Come on Oliver. You're the Director. Make a decision.

The scenes tainted in red. The Val Kilmer trip to the blood cave. These are things right out of the 60's. It reminded me of Peter Fonda as Captain America in the cemetery scene. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.

And the dialogue. I couldn't understand 1/2 of it because of the background noise. And I just think these were vicious, pagan times when a whole lot of brain-picking and dialoguing and networking just didn't go on.

And the 'lets treat our enemies like our friends and return them to positions of power 'cause we're all equals under the same God . . . or multiple Gods.' Man that didn't happen after WWII and I'm pretty certain it didn't happen after the Macedonians sacked Persia and everything else in their path.

One last point. The speeches. If you think that Alexander gave speeches on Honor and Loyalty and a Tranquil Homelife and Glory and Equality to 100,000 men, you deserve this movie.

Jolie is great as Olympias although, didn't you think Alexander's mother should have been a little less hot and older? Colin Farrell, good actor, great hair. Not in the Heston, Burton, Douglas (Kirk. Please), Crowe mold.

Damn tedious. You want something good? Read Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire."" Great characters; great scenes; great descrptions; little dialogue. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1125619200,4,2758,4.633196721311475
2310458,3,B0009PLLN6,"I had such high hopes for this movie. Warner Brothers had assembled some of my favorite actors and actresses to star in this biographical epic, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, not to mention my growing fondness for Rosario Dawson, Colin Farrell and Jared Leto. Add to that the fact that Oliver Stone was the director really peaked my interest. You see, I'm a big fan of Oliver Stones' work in 'The Doors' film and I was hoping he would develop the storyline of 'Alexander' along the same mystical, shamanic stream as he did with Jim Morrison. He didn't.

What fascinates me the most about the larger-than-life figure of Alexander the Great was not his great victories in battle, nor his political genius as demonstrated in the consolidation of nations under Greek rule. The Alexander I had hoped to see explored by Oliver Stone was Alexander the 'Divine.' I wanted to witness his triumphful entry into Alexandria and Cairo to the cheering throngs proclaiming him the ""Sun God."" I longed to enter into the inner recesses of the great pyramid of Cheops with him for his nocturnal vigil in the 'Kings' Chamber' and explore the visions and revelations that unfolded on that historic night.

Incredibly none of this was included, his campaign in Egypt received only a brief mention by Anthony Hopkins as part of an intermitent narration of events provided by the director to fill in the blanks. That's some blank as far as I'm concerned! The only mystical aspects included was the occasional appearance of an eagle flying overhead, leading him forward to new lands and new people and it's visit to his Mother in the end announcing his death.

We all have our own subjective expectations, this one didn't meet mine. That said, I must admit that I'm probably rating this film - One Star - lower than it actually deserves. I think I'm judging it more by what I wanted to see included and wasn't, than commenting on what was actually in the film. Be that as it may, I guess that's the reviewers perogative.

The final and ultimate test for any movie is the 'repeatability factor.' Can I watch it over and over again? With 'Alexander' the answer is unfortunately NO.",1125532800,4,2191,4.788359788359788
2310459,3,B0009PLLN6,"Rented the Director's Cut version last night. I was seriously hesitant to watch this sucker at all, considering how it got lambasted by the critics and many, many others.

So the big question on your mind is ""Was it really that bad?""

Yes ...and no. Sorry. I'm not trying to cut hairs by saying ""define sex"", as Bill Clinton would. I'm just trying to say that there were definitely some excellent qualities in this film that made it watchable.

But there were also some serious downers that made it painful, too.

For me, I didn't have a problem with the acting nor the actors. I thought all of them (yes, even Jolie with her faux-whatever-accent) gave a fine performance. I love Val Kilmer as an actor, and I wasn't disappointed by his portrayal of Phillip, the father of Alexander.

Anthony Hopkins, as always, was fine as the aging Ptolemy who gives us his narrative take of Alexander throughout the film.

The battle scenes were well done, too. You may have heard about ""The Elephant Battle"", and how great it was. Well it is. This alone may well be worth the price of renting the film.

In true Oliver Stone fashion, we also get the colorful scenes of death and destruction, never holding back (ala Platoon, 1986).

Where the movie falters is in its execution and screenplay. The storyline jumps us back and forth and back and forth and back and forth in time, trying to make sense of why Alexander is the way he is. This was terribly irritating and, sometimes, confusing.

""Are we in 329 A.D. again?""

""No.""

""Oh.""

But the film is not as bad as the critics would have you believe. And the Greeks (the current Greeks) just need to shut up about the ""gay"" scenes and eat a few more olives. It was common for men to take other men as lovers. Twas no big deal. And it's not like this film showed two men pumping away at each other. There were only three hugs, two sets of tears, a few words of affection, and one simple kiss. Whoopty-Doo.

I do feel that the problem with the movie is that Stone tried to cover too much information in one short film (although 3 hours might not seem that short to some). But when you try to capture all of the essence of one man who changed the course of history in one, quick stroke, I think you're bound to fail. This thing should've been a miniseries, about 6-12 hours in length, in order to keep the story flow moving forward without the confusing and constant flashbacks.

So is it worth your time? I think so. It's not Stone's best film, but it's definitely entertaining.",1125532800,5,2513,4.458515283842795
2310460,5,B0009PLLN6,"I liked this movie so much when I saw it in the theatre I went back and saw it again a few days later. This is not just another war movie. By the time you see Alexander standing at the top of the Hindu Kush telling Ptolemy that every time he goes to a new country he peels away another layer of illusion, it is obvious that this movie is portraying Alexander's conquest as a creative and spiritual quest driven by deep personal needs. I liked the feeling of destiny, the exhilaration of vicariously enjoying the success of someone who is not afraid to go after what he wants, tempered by the awareness that everything has its limits and that ultimately ""all men reach and fail.""
Another thing I liked was how Alexander's mother Olympias puts her own strength and ambition into him. In her intense love for him, as well as her horrible manipulativeness the movie shows (whether Oliver Stone intended to or not) what can happen to the energies of a strong woman in a society where she has no outlet for her ambitions except through her son. I liked too how Alexander's relationship with Hephaistion provides him with a balancing factor to his obsessive need for achievement. Hephaistion reminds him that love is important too. He is very supportive of Alexander, but provides a balancing perspective. Theirs is as close to an equal relationship as a king at that time could have, a spiritual-sexual friendship of the kind approved in the movie by their teacher Aristotle. I like a lot of things about this movie but I'll only mention one more. I liked the way the symbolism of the eagle appears throughout the movie and underlines the major themes.
I give the Theatrical Release version five stars.
I give the new Director's Cut only four stars because of excessive flashbacks that interrupt the flow and shape of the story, and some things taken out that I think should have been left in.",1125446400,4,1887,4.635820895522388

Implying that his mother had a hand in the murder of his father, and that Alexander took his own life after the death of his friend and lover was ridiculously speculative and made no sense.  The insistence that he  felt a mission to be ""politically correct"" in his dealings with those he conquered was far from historically accurate.  He wanted to Hellenize the world, but that didn't mean that he thought that the Greeks were any less than the most civilized people on Earth.

When he continually referred to his actions in the ""known world"" one has to wonder why he would use this term . . unless he knew of the existence of some ""unknown world.""

I like Stone's movies as whole, but this one is a wee bit of a mess. After almost three hours, you still don't know what makes Alexander tick (except maybe that his mother poisoned his mind). Admittedly, the film bravely addresses Alexander's bi-sexuality (not a wise commercial move when you consider the target market for an action epic is teenage males), but this doesn't serve to add any dimension to Alexander's character. The film's episodic nature doesn't make for cohesive viewing, and the use of flash forwards and flash backs simply makes it worse - one minute Alexander is a boy of ten, the next minute he's rallying his troops for his  famous victory at Gaugamela. There's no sense of drama, which is a shame because there's some great opportunities for drama here - his relationship with his father, the conflict with his squabbling commanders, and his own obssession with conquering the world. Despiite the almost three hour running time, you always feel like you're missing important scenes. Nothing is dealt with in-depth. The two battles simply happen - there's no buildup and as far as the final battle is concerned, you're not even sure where the heck it happened. The battles themselves are a confusing mess, despite supers during Gaugamela telling you where you are in the fight. The CGI effects are terribly obvious - the entry into Babylon is like viewing a computer game. At times, you actually feel like you're watching a TV movie, with lots of overacting extras, bad special effects and a terrible soundtrack.

I don't know. Maybe the story of Alexander is impossible to film; Robert Rossen's 1955 go at it was no great shakes either. Even Steven Pressfield's novel (which is strikingly similar to this film) didn't shed much light on what drove Alexander to conquer the world.

This movies takes a different aproach when compared with say Troy which was an awesome movie by itself. Troy was more Flashy more Commercial more of what today's crowd wants to see, Brad Pitt came on like a Comic Super Hero. Alexander is not about protraying this Super Hero instead a more romantic more down to reality Character is protraid. His mother's influence and him as well as his fathers Phillip King of Macedon who set up the path for Alexander to conquere the world, firstly by redisigning the structure of the Macedonian Army with a Phalanx type of formation and secondly and most importantly by forcing the Greek states into a Union without which  Alexander could have never dream of performing his conquests. This is acurately

as far as i am concern, i have read many History Books on Alexander about his career and his life.

The greeks value, specially during this CLASSIC period honor and friendship and the binding love between friends, unfortunately today people well some people confused this with Homexuality, they just don't get it, they have not read Aristotle, Plato and Socrates to say the list, to learn about the state of mind of the greeks back then. Men were bounded  with values which today don't exist anymore and which are normaly confuded by a special crown with Homsexual behaviour, couldn't be farther from the truth.....

Alexander had little time for women, he was far beyond this, he was born for a purpose like Jesus and Mohamend, Hitler, these type of man has a different mindset that is all they are not Bixesual.

In todays mediocrasy it is of course used by Homosexuals to

change its historuical value. To say Alexander was gay is the same as to say, Julios Ceasar or Jesus were gay.........

At the battle of Guagamela 47,000 heavily armed Greeks met a large number of lightly armed Persians. The Greeks lost 500 killed. Yet the conclusion of this battle looks more like aftermath of the battle of Borodino in which tens of thousands were killed.

However the major irritation is not the historical howlers. At school there are two types of people. Those who are good at sport and those who like reading books. The ones who are good at sport develop a self confidence early on and are free of doubt in themselves and what to do. Those who read books are always full of self doubt and dither when faced by decisions. Alexander was a person who was raised for militiary command since being born and commanded large bodies of men from the age of 17. There is not the slightest suggestion that he ever suffered from self confidence or doubt in himself. His invasion of the Persian Empire was a meticulously thought out operation which involved the neutralisation of the Western part of the empire to destroy Persian sea power and to free the Greek cities in Ionia. Alexander then moved to conquer the centre of the Empire.

Stone's portrait of Alexander is one of the sort of kid at school who read books, who was eaten by self doubt and dithered. Not only is Alexander portrayed in that way so are his generals. Prior to the battle of Guagamela which was an easy win the movie portrays Alexander's generals as wanting to retreat or not to engage. The historical accounts suggest that after previous victories including Issus the Greeks knew that they would win and Alexander's generals were more confident than he was.

The ancients saw Alexander's life as a tragedy. He started his campaign with Greek virtues but he began to be seduced by barbarian customs. He wanted his soldiers to prostate themselves to him and he wanted to merge the Persian and Greek peoples. Stone has a different approach. He sees Alexander as a wounded soul because of his fathers rejection of him and his mother. The real Alexander was not a 20th century feel good type who suffered from identity issues. He was a person who was raised in what was at the time the most militarily developed part of the world and he set about using his country to conquer the world.

The battle scenes which were usually Stone's forte, were boring. The movie flipped back and forth several times in flashbacks. This did not help the already diffused narrative thread. Alexander's sexuality was addressed. I guess it was supposed to be better in the director's cut, but it was still not very well done. A pouting boyfriend hanging around in the background with no substantial role was not interesting. Alexander's wife had very little to do too.

The good parts are the exotic scenery and the supporting caste, except for Jolie. Plummer, Kilmer, and Hopkins were good. I just had a hard time sitting through it.",1124928000,4,936,4.632530120481928
2310475,2,B0009PLLN6,"Back in the 1980's I thought Oliver Stone was the greatest director we'd ever seen when he released, ""Platoon"". He's never been able to catch lightning in a bottle again, since.

""Alexander"" is the story of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) and his conquests and his relationship with his mother Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and his father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer).

The film is ostensibly being told in flashbacks via the great scholar Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to his students. It is an unnecessary gimmick. Hopkins does fine and the added time is arguably some of the best information that we receive in the film - BUT if the script had been better written, these scenes would not have been necessary.

Farrell is in way over his head as the lead in this film. He can't carry the film. He neither has the talent nor the emotional range for such an historic figure. Why does Farrell use his native Irish accent (and why does the young actor who plays him as a youth do the same?)? More on this later...

Jolie as Alexander's mother uses as bizarre Russian-esque accent that is terribly out of place with who Olympia actually was.

Stone seems to be confused as to what direction to take the film. He gives us enormous battles of grand scale, but he doesn't take the time to let us learn about the combatants (you get face shots, but from a distance you can't tell who's who). He attempts to give us detail about Alexander's thought process regarding current and future battles/conquests, but the dialog itself is so juvenile in content that it's more like a couple of kids arguing over who's going to play cowboy and who's going to play Indian.

We move through all of Alexander's important battles ad infinatum!! It is completely unnecessary for us to go through each and every battle in the way that Stone has us do. It is redundant and quite frankly very boring after a time. How many times can we hear that Alexander's troops are unhappy and disagree with his campaign and that they want to go home? Well, we hear it over and over. And we also get repeats of almost the same speech from Alexander...

Alexander doesn't take spoils of war in Babylon, India or any other areas of Asia. This we are told over and over. But we are never privy to the ""why"". There's more action than dialogue and even though this was intended to be a BIG TENT POLE film (aka: action film), the very subject matter warrants a closer, more intelligent look than this film provides.

Alexander was the not only Alexander the Great, but he is - to this very day - the greatest (and some would say most benevolent) conqueror to ever walk the Earth. Surely, such trite treatment is insulting to his greatness.

I'll give a few kudos to Stone for his major inclusion of Alexander's bisexuality (it wasn't a big thing back then), but what the heck is up with that androgenous male dancer with whom he takes up late in the film? Did he cast away Hephestaion (his lover since childhood)? Is he cheating on him? It is seemly there for shock value. It makes no sense plotwise. Since Jared Leto is cast as Hephastaion, it would seem that the best material regarding Alexander and his male lover are on the cutting room floor - Leto's role is so small that it is almost cameo material.

Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife is very miscast. She looks about as Persian as an Eskimo. That aside, we're never really sure if she is disgusted with Alexander's relationship with Hephastaion or if it is Alexander with whom she is initially disgusted - a better set of actors might have been able to answer this question.

Now, the accents....Jolie's Russian is totally bizarre, but let's move on. We know that it is traditional for American films to have foreign characters denoted by using English accents. If the foreign characters are villains then they typically (and insultingly) use German accents. If this is the case, then why in the world is Farrell using his native Irish for Alexander? Why not English? No one else uses the Irish accent. Here we have the accents of an immediate family: Philip (kilmer), Alexander's father: English accent; Olympia (Jolie), Alexander's mother: Russian accent; Alexander  (Farrell), Irish accent. Bizarre doesn't even begin to describe it. The poor kid who played Alexander as a young boy must have been nonplussed trying to figure out why he was delivering his dialog in an Irish accent.

The film is sadly not worth the three hours it takes to watch it. I would really enjoy seeing a film on Alexander using a tight script, good actors, and some tight direction. ""Alexander"" has none of these.",1124755200,9,4606,4.671604938271605

Unsure why there was a need to make his bisexuality and race-mixing ideals such a major part of the story. It's the 21'st century... Most of us have accepted, if not embraced, it as normal. It somehow gave me the impression that featuring these ""hot button"" themes were to make Alexander seem freakish. Or at least not mentally sound.

It's long and interesting and has great pictures of far away exotic places, and although I wouldn't want to read the Britanica cover to cover, I'd advise anyone to subject themselves to Oliver Stone's historical biography. This is a play-by-play review of the DVD. Preliminary thoughts include feeling as though I am boarding the Titanic as I sit down to watch this notoriously criticized film, and there is a nagging doubt that it is somewhat shameful for a director to approve a modified version of his product with ""Faster-paced Action"", like it was a new improved laundry detergent. ...

Colin Farrell (Alexander), looks like a bunny rabbit in shock, like that last living look of a soon to be road kill on a country highway. Alexander has conquered half of Asia and I keep thinking of other things I might be doing with my time, like cleaning my apartment or starting a stamp collection. As I write, Alexander and his buddies are discussing the dangers of homosexuality. Mind you, they're all in skirts. The battle marching scenes are stunning, the actual battles; so-so, with sweeping aerial scenes of thousands warring, intercut with ridiculous close-ups of swords piercing a foot, and facial reactions to injuries like being bopped on the head by The Three Stooges. The subtitles are absurd. ""MACEDONIAN LEFT"", means nothing to me. It's hard to tell who's winning the battle but the charging camels win best float in the parade, (I've yet to see the earth-shaking stampeding Indian elephants), ...Hell, Bush would have conquered Asia in half this time, ...There's a ""Gone With The Wind"" dead battlefield nod. Nice. ...I'm in Persia now. Alexander is falling in love  ... with everybody. Nothing like a little Greek debauchery. Better lock up the camels and snakes. ... Damn, I hit the wrong button on the remote and I'm back to the beginning. Babylonian Twilight Zone. Was I in Persia or India?, it all looks like an ancient Asian opium room, ... I'm through the first hour. Not bad. Not bad at all. It has a youthful and adventurous ""Jason and The Argonauts"" appeal, and a philosophical world domination theme, and epic cinematic proportions of ancient global vistas and artistic design. What the producer's of this DVD need to do now is offer a secret Alexander decoder ring in every package. ... After nearly three hours, it's over, and the verdict is, it's long and complicated, and the ill-chronological order doesn't help matters, but it's a great film.",1124582400,5,2821,4.877083333333333
2310483,2,B0009PLLN6,"First off, let me just say that I would never make a film on Alexander because I do not posses the quantity of mind to. I know I cannot reach that level of perfection so it's easy to criticise another's work. When you're making a film on Alexander you expect everything to be larger than life yet quite close to most people's perception of reality. Colin Farrell made a weak, very disappointing, disillusioning Alexander. I wanted to like this film but the very character that played the lead role failed to remotely bring justice to the king of kings.

I enjoyed the film at first and tried my best to ignore the over obsessive Angelina Jolie who played the role of Olympus. Let me just say the half impish Russian accent she sported did no good for outlining her character. The war scenes in the film aren't really anything like we haven't ever seen before. There is nothing the film tries to over emphasise on. I could take this film seriously for the 160 minutes of it's playing time. The person who played the Persian King was more fit for his role than any other person in this film. Babylon was shown with a lot of glory and quite rightfully so.

I hear from a lot of people that the story is twisted in it's own way. Alexander wasn't murdered they say. I do not believe it is correct to diss the film on this basis. The best scene in the film comes when Alexander's 40,000 army fights the 250,000. There is a shot of an eagle flying in the sky and the camera is focussed on the war below from the eagle's eye.

Watch this film if you saw Troy and must watch everything that is focussed on an ancient epic tale of a leader of men. Colin Farrell gave his 90% to this film but then his capacity fails him from personifying Alexander. A friend mentioned the actor of Van Helsing would have made a better Alexander. I agree.

P.S-

To ""Amanda Richards(who wrote a poem for her review of the same)

I don't know about anybody else but why in the hell would you cast Colin Ferrell who doesn't look like he could fight his way out of a paper bag? I would think less of a pretty boy and someone more rugged like Russell crow with some curly locks!

That doesn't mean this film lacks problems.  Some of the plotting was a bit long and boring and the acting was not always up to par; however, Colin Farrell was very good in the role of Alexander the Great and Angelina Jolie took mother-behind-the-scenes to new heights.

2310486,2,B0009PLLN6,"The Directors Cut...

I did something rather unfortunate I actually watched the directors cut of Alexander.  The truth of the matter is I didn't find the theatrical version of the movie nearly as bad as some the reviewers here at Amazon nor the critics who get paid to trash other people's hard work.

I gave/give Oliver Stone credit for trying to bring to the screen the life of someone who accomplished more in his 32/33 years of life than most people do if they live to be 80.  Here was a man who held together an army of well over a hundred thousand men, and this isn't counting their wives, mistresses, children, slaves, craftsmen, merchants, and traders.  Alexander's was a mobile city, a mobile kingdom led by the center, kept together by the center, and destroyed when the center died.  Here was a man who fought at the head of his army, not asking his men to do anything he himself would refuse to do.  He was wounded by every conceivable weapon of the day. All of this he did without losing a battle. This is a man who was a strategic genius whose exploits and concept of universality paved the way for Christianity, a universal language and a universal monetary code.  Generals today still study his military tactics and implement them in some form or fashion.  And these are people who because of Alexander's sexual proclivities wouldn't even allow him to enter the armed forces today.

In the theatrical release of this film Oliver tried to convey Alexander's strengths and weaknesses as a man and as a leader while at the same time illustrating his vast and ultimately unattainable dream of inclusion. (Yes he wanted to conquer but he also respected those he conquered; he allowed them to keep their own traditions and religion.  He even adapted some of their customs in order to show his good faith. ) Did Oliver Stone's reach exceed his grasp?  Sure it did. But considering the subject matter I dare say anyone taking on the daunting task of retelling one of the greatest stories ever told about one of the greatest lives ever lived would have had a difficult time pulling it off.

Where I fault Mr. Stone is his attempt to appease those narrow minded bigots who will never accept that Alexander not only had three wives but a eunuch lover Bagoas and a male lover of nearly nineteen years in his general Hephaestion.  With this new cut of the film one is hard pressed to understand the significance of Hephaestion in the grand scheme of things making Alexander's reaction to his death near the end impossible to understand.  The voice over of Ptolemy says that Alexander follows Hephaestion down to the house of death as he promised.  And yet in this new cut of the film you don't see that promise, therefore for the audience there is no contextual reference for Ptolemy's comment.

There are several such moments in this new cut of the film.  Things that seems to come out of nowhere and it is only when you watch the film with the commentary that you somewhat understand what Oliver was thinking when he pieced it together in this way.  And even then one is left scratching their heads in wonderment as to why he felt to need to cave into the studio and other outside forces that wanted a more sanitized version of the film.  It appeared from the film Alexander would and should have been more upset had Bagoas or Roxanne had died.

If you want to see this movie, I suggest you buy the theatrical version and not waste your time and energy trying to decipher this mess.

Theatrical Release.....

I did a review for the directors cut, so I thought it only fair that I do one for the theatrical release......

Oliver Stone gets a big round of applause from me on the theatrical release of this film.  He took on a huge project which had only been done once before with the 1950 release of Alexander the Great starring Richard Burton as Alexander. So there's a 54 year gap where Hollywood wouldn't or couldn't tackle the subject matter again for the big screen.

Unlike the more profitable Troy, Alexander doesn't shy away from what Oliver Stone calls Alexander's pan-sexuality. In that he had sexual relationships with women, men and eunuchs. This wasn't shown gratuitously or graphically, but simply as a part of who he was.  Trying as the whole film does to present us with a fuller picture of the man, and not just his deeds which are monumental. This unfortunately to some fans and critics alike seemed to have been a mistake, and some so called educated people couldn't get past that in their critiques of the film; which is unfortunate because it vividly illustrates that we're not as progressive as a society as we would like to think we are or in fact claim we are. It would seem in this instance we could learn a huge lesson from the ancient Greeks and their acceptance of the human body as well as sexuality; considering they didn't have a term for heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.  Labels weren't necessary achievement and integrity where what counted in the end.  We seem to have lost that somewhere along the way, by making one's sexual orientation speak more to character than actual deeds, motivations, and integrity.

To me more than anything in this film Oliver tried to make Alexander more human, which by extension makes him more accessible to the audience. By showing the audience the power struggle going on between his father Philip and his mother Olympias we're given insight into not only some of Alexander's personal drive; but what he rose above and in some cases what led to his downfall.

That being said there were some flaws in the film which is to be expected considering the vastness of the story and the scope of the life trying to be captured in what comparatively is a small medium with limitations considering the subject matter hence the 54 year gap between attempts being made to deliver this story to the screen.

The DVD contains some interesting documentaries as well as commentary by Oliver Stone himself and Robin Lane Fox who wrote the book Alexander the Great, and was the historical consultant on the film. The extras give great insight into the motivation behind certain aspects involved not only in developing this film from concept to actuality, but gives the audience insight into the process of making a film with huge potential and a great amount of pressure because of that potential.

No one can tell you what your tastes are going to dictate to you.  Not a review or even a slew of them can do that.  What I will say is this.  If you are in the least bit interested in the life of Alexander the Great then watching this film will feed into that interest and might inspire you to look further into his life on your own.  If for whatever reason any hint of homosexuality, bisexuality, or anything you consider an alternative lifestyle bother you, then I suggest that you run as far and as fast as you can from this film because it's going to bother you.  But if you have an open mind and would like to get a glimpse even a flawed one into the life of a man who by the age of 25 conquered the known world then buy the theatrical edition of this film.  It's by no means the greatest film ever made, but its ambition and audacity made it for worth watching for me....",1124409600,12,7239,4.59083850931677
2310487,1,B0009PLLN6,"For starters, Collin Farrell is a very poor choice as an Alexander. His dyed yellow hair was getting on my nerves and his acting was just about as annoying. Second, if you want to see a movie about Alexander The military leader this is not the movie for you. Oliver Stone is so fixed on alledged gayness of Alexander that he forgets everything else. I don't know if he has gay tendencies himself since he lovingly showcases Alexander's alledged ""love"" affair with his best friend, and his numerous gay encounters with persian boys wearing eyeliner. Alexander's closest circle of warriors look laughable-they are so effeminine that by no stretch of imagition can you picture them fighting in a war.

The thing i really liked about this movie was the acting. I thought there were plenty of parts acted with a ton of emotion and charisma by the leads of Farrel, Jolie, and Kilmer. But thats about all the pluses i have on this movie...

After watching this movie i never got the feeling of 'Wow, Alexander really was great.' Sure he conquered the large part of the known world but i never got the sense of his accomplishments. What he did and ruled was put on the back burner to focus on his troubled relationships.

And it seemed no one liked the poor guy. From his parents, to his wife, to his soldiers, to his enemies, no one liked him... except for Jared Leto of course.
And all this hate of Alexander ends in an anti-climatic death. Blah.

And there were two battle scenes in this 3 hour movie. Two!
And while both showed a grand scale of battle, there were plenty of mish mash parts in the fights with a lot of clips thrown together. An average battle scene of one minute would have 30 different fight clips each lasting about 2 seconds. Not enough focus in the fights.
Though there was a ridiculous focus on the elephant vs horse battle in which Alexander gets injured.

All in all i feel this movie deserves all of the negativity and failure that follows it around. I score it a very mediocre 2.5 stars for an epic with tons of potential but not enough vision.",1124323200,3,1535,4.353146853146853

At the end of the movie as Alexander dies, triumphant, reverent music is in the background, as if you just watched someone who inspired and loved die...For me it was a joke and I was just happy he was dead and thankful that the movie was almost over.  The supporting characters disliked Alexander, they hated his penchant for boys, they hated crossing Asia for him, even his wives disliked him.  I think that they missed out that Alexander, like other conquering figures in history, is a megalomaniac.  Colin was whiny and generally weak and not believable. His father was generally disappointed in him and his mother was psychotic. You have to suspect when a movie has a ""director's cut"" it has got to be bad.",1124236800,4,1097,4.692708333333333

It is very easy to tear the movie apart when you do not know the REAL story, Stone did well, Farrell did a great part too, some great historical facts were not included, but I think is impossible to say absolutely everything about Alexander, he was simply bigger than life.",1124236800,7,489,4.49438202247191
2310491,5,B0009PLLN6,"I watched ""Alexander"" with a very critical eye after reviewing the History Channel's ""The True Story of Alexander the Great.""  Except for Alexander's being ""critically wounded"" during the first Indian engagement, this is one of the most accurately portrayed ""historical"" movies I've seen in a very long time. Good for you, Mr. Stone, you've done a marvelous job!

The actors did a very well with this difficult subject matter and I say, so what if Colin Farrell lapsed into his Irish brogue upon occasion as some ""reviewer"" mentioned. Should the cast be expected to affect a Macadonian or Persian accent instead?  IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OVERALL ENJOYMENT.

At first I was a bit dismayed that it appeared some of the critical moments in Alexander's young life had been left out, then discovered they hadn't been left out at all.  Mr. Stone used ""flashback sequences"" to augment and clarify what was taking place in ""the present"" by giving us a glimps of the past.  Also, had the story been sequential, it would have become tedious and the audience would have lost interest quickly. Most of the ""action"" is up front...

Historically, ""Alexander"" meets 98% of my expectations.  It is brutal and gruesome, but what war was or is not? It does depict homosexuality, yet this was acceptable in Greek culture in this time frame, so get used to that.

If you enjoy historically ""larger than life"" figures, you'll enjoy ""Alexander"", with all his scars (physical as well as mental) and imperfections.",1124236800,7,1496,4.9282868525896415
2310492,4,B0009PLLN6,"great movie although could have been better, i'm a fan of alexander

and i think we should thank mr stone for bringing alexander the great to the big screen. this movie is historically accurate for the most part except for the scene where alexander is saved by cleitus the black at the battle of gaugamela/arbela in reality this took place three years prior to gaugamela at the battle of granicus, and also cassander was not present at gaugamela nor at the campaign in the east for alexander didn't trust him and felt that keeping him in macedonia would be the better choice. in the movie alexander is wounded at the battle of hydaspes well in actuality he was wounded later on while storming a city. the movie also follows greek propaganda by putting the persian army as 250000 warriors at gaugamela while in reality darius III would not have been able to field more than 100000 men due to logistics of the time, i think 90000 is far more likey.

overall this movie does a fine job at portraying the known world of the 4th century BC. the sets and costumes were impresive. the only thing i can complain of is the part where philip is assasinated by pausanias, why did oliver stone choose to put this so late into the movie. i didn't find the homoerotic scenes to be distracting at all, everyone knows that pederasty and bisexuality was common in ancient greece. we have to remember that alexander lived before judeo/christian values were introduced to the west.",1124236800,3,1462,4.640926640926641
2310493,4,B0009PLLN6,"I must agree with the review by 'Cubist,' because this movie just seems like a hastily put together term paper. I almost imagine how the Baz Luhrrman version might have been had Oliver Stone not finished this film first. The Gaugamela battle scene is very piece-meal and almost a complete bore, but Stone gets a reprieve for the battle scene against King Porus toward the end of the movie. The acting is not anything to write home about. Colin Farrell acted with what he had. I also think that the character of Alexander was written to come off as more weak and insecure than any reader of history would expect. The homosexuality of Alexander seemed to be thrown in your face a little too much. I have known that Alexander was bisexual since I was in the sixth grade, and now being an adult a few years out of college, this movie really surprised me with its homosexual overtones. But for some reason I am intrigued by this movie. Everytime I watch it,  I think that this movie is not all that good, but I have somehow rented it about three times. NO this movie is not an Oscar calibur film. NO this movie does not have a twist at the end. NO the acting is not profound and inspiring. However this movie is entertaining, and I think that is all that really matters.",1124236800,3,1265,4.405982905982906
2310494,5,B0009PLLN6,"I like Oliver Stone's films, and reviews of this film lead me to believe that this film would suck, although some claimed it's actually a good film and is underrated. From what I read on the ""Alexander"" IMDB boards, more people prefer the director's cut of the movie rather than the theatrical cut (and that's usually the case). Apparently, the DC is somewhat like the TC, except that it's eight minutes shorter, and switches scenes around to ""help the story flow better"". Hmm. So I thought to myself: ""I do like Oliver Stone's films (my favorite being JFK), and he really hasn't let me down yet"". IMDB's rating for Alexander is 5.5, but then again, I don't really trust IMDB's ratings, due to the fact that most users either vote a 1 or a 10, which explains how the Lord of the Rings trilogy is on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time list. I read RT, and they give Alexander a 14%, but then again, they allow anyone with a website to comment on movies. I also read that this is one film where you definitely WANT to ignore the critics on.

WELL, I finally decided to give this film a chance, and rented this film (the director's cut version) last night. This movie was much better than the reviews I've read and heard said it would be. The action was completely believable. The effects were phenomenal during the battle scenes. As for historical epics, this movie was not as good as Gladiator or Braveheart, of course, but I still enjoyed this film. Overall, probably the most underrated film of 2004.",1124236800,5,1501,4.498168498168498
2310495,5,B0009PLLN6,"I think brilliant and elusive encapsulates this films outstanding strengths and why it is such an interesting & rewarding watch, as well as it's weaknesses.

 In order to appreciate the whole Alexander epic as here, & it's a great piece of film all round, you have to absorb the whole and accept the careening out of control complications that such a story weaves in trying to capture so many things which defy definition - and the Alexander as here, is about the torment of defying as well as the need to do so, in it's insatiable hunger of reaching for the gods.

 This is the best cut of the film, it has the most footage, i liked the actual movie theatrical cut better than the so called Director's cut, but this is the one.

 Surely this is possibly Stone's Greatest film, and is one of the riches of recent modern day big hollywood mythical/semi-historical sword & cape epics - a genre which is very exciting in an inspired type of way when well done like 'Alexander the final cut' is an example of.",1124236800,,1005,4.46448087431694

I was practically asleep by the end of the movie. It skipped around far too much, if it weren't for the length of Colin Farrell's hair I would have had no idea what time period we were in. The acting was decent, except for the fact that almost every character save for Angelina Jolie had an IRISH accent. ""Alexander"" was based in Macedonia, not in Dublin! The look of the movie was fantastic, I would expect nothing less of the hugely talented Oliver Stone, but he failed to captivate me as he did so well with the Doors movie, in which he portrayed Jim Morrison fabulously and correctly.

2310497,5,B0009PLLN6,"Look...I'm one of those people who really HATES it when they make ""historical"" movies that deviate HORRIBLY from history. This movie tracks VERY close to history. I think modern Americans haven't received it well because Alexander ends up having intercourse with 1) a black woman; and 2) men. Well, guess what...Alexander was bisexual. And including that bit of history was not just titillation--it was historically important, as the lack of an heir to his throne was VERY important to history. Also, the distress over his lover's death was well-documented. The story of Alexander the Great is one that has enthralled every generation for 2300 years...up until this one. Our generation seems to prefer rap videos. Wake up. Alexander is history's greatest general. He did what no one dared--attack and unite most of the known world. Everything but the personal conversations in this movie REALLY happened...and all the personal conversations are necessary to flesh out the things we DON'T know (Alexander stands in for historians when he asks his mother if he arranged his father's assassination, for instance. Her answer is unconvincing to Alexander...and to historians, too). This story is important. Alexander united everything between Greece and China under one roof, if only for a moment. It's a HUGE bit of history. The fact that people don't know or care is pathetic. Some reviewers carped on Angelina Jolie's slavic accent. Her character was from Epirus, which is roughly analogous to modern day Albania. We don't know what their accents sounded like, but a Slavic accent was as good as any. The IDEA was likely to emphasize that Olympias was not seen as Greek or Macedonian, really, by Philip, etc. She was seen as alien. An outsider. Some reviewers were bothered that Alexander was so emotional, etc.  Well, all historical accounts say that he really WAS that way (as were many ancient leaders and peoples--Romans cried in public all the time).

2310498,2,B0009PLLN6,"So after the first half hour or so, I was wondering if this was made for Hollywood or for the History Channel. Then I realized that the History Channel would have made it more interesting.

Here's the problem: The major plot device of this film is Anthony Hopkins telling you what's happening. Sometimes they show you what he's talking about, sometime's they don't. I won't spoil any plot, but at one point he just mentions that ""Person X was murdered so person Y was no longer in exile."" We just watched a 15 minute scene of Angelina Jolie talking about snakes for no reason, and now you are telling me about a murder? I want to SEE the murder. Of course, some 2 hours later they show you, but how am I to know that?

Ok, so the timeline is hard to follow, but not as bad as other biopics can be (READ: Ali). The bizzarre thing about this movie is the sheer volume of homo-eroticism. There was a lot in the media about how this film suggested that Alexander was gay. Understatement of the year. I think every scene in this 3 hour long movie bonked me over the head with it. After the 38th longing glance to that guy with the long hair, I was pretty sure how he felt about other dudes. It felt like Monty Python: ""Get on with it!""

This movie is waaay too long, and disc one is essentially pointless. Disc two gets nice and raunchy with lots of blood and skin, and an absolutely classic execution scene that I rewound like 5 times. But I get the feeling that the people who made this movie never sat down and watched the whole thing. Because it does not hang together at all.

Plus, Alexander was chimeric, with one green eye and one brown/hazel eye. Color contacts have been invented. It would have been cool to see this done accurately.

If you have a lot of time to kill, go ahead and watch this with someone who has a good sense of humor. The fodder here is incredible. Disc two has some excitement and frontal (reversal?) nudity that might be exciting for some. I have a feeling though that his movie might become a sort of gay cult classic.

2310512,3,B0009PLLN6,"I must say I was very disappointed in this film. A number of years ago I was commissioned to sculpt a head of Alexander, and felt compelled to do an indept research about the man. I found him to be a man of great depth and courage. This movie fails to represent him as either (for the most part). The boy who portrayed him as a young Alexander who tamed the wild stallion was far more convincing to me than Colin Farrell, who by the way, is one of my favorite actors. I felt he was mis-cast in this role, didn't quite know what to do with it. He came across as weak, confused and not too wise. And where was his historical lover, Hephaistion? Jared Leto's role (on the DVD anyway)was limited to a few hugs and standing around in the background. I had expected to see a very dynamic relationship  between the two men.

While the costumes and sets were magnificent, and the score was hauntingly beautiful (how could it not be with Vangelis composing it?), the movie itself was disjointed...the flashbacks interrupted the flow of the storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie about a man whom history paints as one of the greatest men of all time. Of course, one must ask: Who was Alexander? For legends distort reality; but there is a tremendous amount of historical documentation about the man to give us a fairly accurate portrait of who he was and what he did. I had high hopes that this movie would be the one to really bring him to life. It utterly failed.

To make things worse, this DVD presents a chopped up version of what was shown in theaters. I had also hoped the bonus materials would be more impressive, The sound on the documentaries was so bad it was difficult to understand the dialogue. All in all, it was a major letdown.  But who knows...maybe sometime in the future someone will try again, and perhaps there will be a film worthy of the man being portrayed.",1124064000,,1886,4.410919540229885

2310515,4,B0009PLLN6,"I found it incredibly ironic that one reviewer claimed the bisexuality portrayed in the film was distracting.  That seems to speak to a culture steeped in anti-gay bigotry.  The heterosexual portrayals were not distracting?  The movie early on makes it clear the dominant theme is Alexander's drive to glory and to a one-world vision.  The wild bedroom scene, showing no shyness towards female nudity, is totally out of place, having no relevance to the movie's theme.  It is the ""heterosexuality"" of Alexander's that Stone takes great pains to showcase that is the real distraction here.  In terms of Alexander's homosexuality (too much evidence to even consider bisexuality for him, though bisexuality was the accepted cultural norm), and Greek homoeroticism, Stone downplayed that throughout the movie.  I appreciated the fine detail and accuracy of the costumes throughout the movie (in particular the Persian), with the exception of the Macedonian and Greek clothing and statuary.  Any casual review of their art would reveal far less drapery than Stone employed on his actors (and statues).  The scene in the gymnasium, a word which in the Greek means a place to be naked, had everyone wrapped well enough to be at a Mormon swim party.  The minimal and reluctant depictions of other than modern middle American sexuality and sensibilities appear to have evoked the greater part of the stinging criticisms.

The was a huge story (Alexander's life and achievements, and character), and any undertaking to film it would have been a major challenge to fit the story into a timeframe and storyline that works on screen.  Stone is to be commended highly for making that attempt.  Alexander's life was one characterized by a profound philosophical and spiritual bent, and it is evident Stone tried to capture that as much as the historical events and political and military drama.  In the end, I believe he did a good if not exceptional job.  Too much talk (verbal exposition), though using Ptolemy to narrate was, I thought, a clever device, since Ptolemy was a significant source for the few historians' accounts we have of Alexander. Many key events in Alexander's rise were omitted.  As mentioned earlier, Greek and Macedonian (who, by the way, were of the same Doric origin as the Greeks farther south) culture were misrepresented somewhat to accommodate modern tastes and squeamishness.  And, as unfortunately happens, historical accuracy gets sacrificed for cinematic effect (Alexander's introduction to Darius' harem, the death of Boukephalos, among others), but far less than in many other movies.

On the other side, the battle scenes, to me, were mesmerizing, almost as good as the scenes in ""Return of the King.""  Large in scale, accurately bloody without overdoing the gore, arousing action and camera angles.  Colin's portrayal of Alexander captures the complexity, the emotional, the visionary core of the man, far more human and historical than other admirable portrayals (Nathan Algren, Maximus, for example).  The diluted depictions and references to intermale love and sexuality are there, though one needs a familiarity with history and culture to catch it all.  The sets were beautifully created and presented (Babylon--by the way, NOT in Persia; Alexandria's harbor, among them).  All in all, Stone and his cast and crew made an honest and well-done effort to encapsulate Alexander's monumental life and humanity on film.",1123977600,4,3442,5.240875912408759
2310516,1,B0009PLLN6,"Ok it appears to me that a lot of you are having difficulty with the definitions of words.  Some use the following words to describe this movie:

Accurate: completely correct, being accurate.
Factual: containing facts
Believable: something or someone which can be believed
Good: having the right qualities, satisfactory

These are just a couple of words that do not apply to this movie in any way.  I will lend a hand and give you the words that are most befitting this movie:

Tripe: worthless speech or writing, nonsense
Drivel: nonsense
Fallacious: wrong
Awful: very bad, unpleasant

Just to remind reviewers that seem to have a problem.  5 stars are awarded for good things and 1 star is awarded for bad things.  It seems a lot of people misunderstand that.

This movie is so insulting to such a variety of people:

Viewers: If they expect viewers to accept that Alexander, the greatest military man of all time, in any way mirrored this debauchery on the screen then they should be charging $50 or $60 a crack because those people are morons and would probably be freed from their financial excess quite easily.

The Greek People:  This is their great war hero?  I think not.  This is an insult to the people that look on him as part of their national identity.

The Ancient Greek Soldiers:  None of them would have followed this big mama's boy to the latrine let alone the field of battle.

Anyone that was defeated by the Greeks:  You are insulting all of the men who died at the hand of Alexander's armies.  The leadership presented here couldn't defeat a pack of girl scouts

This movie was plain awful.  Alexander would have been better cast as a paraplegic Native American.  That would be more plausible then this lifeless portrayal.  Alexander's mom give me a break.  First off she is the same age as Alexander and never ages.  Also what is with the Russian accent?

2310517,4,B0009PLLN6,"Compared to most epics it was historically accurate although some liberties were taken (i.e the horse didn't die in that battle but from old age, etc).

However, the battle of Gaugemala, the snakes of his mother, the winning over of the horse tied to its shadow, his father missing an eye . . . wow, I could go on for pages but there's a lot that's on the money.

Focus was more on philosophical and academic teachings to the audience which I could see having a negative impact.  You need to watch this film closely to get it or you will get lost.  Trying to do something else, as I found, will make you miss important moments.

Accents were mostly Celtic/Irish and most Historians feel the Macedonians were Celts anyway.

Negative aspects?  Lots of stories going on and flashbacks hopping back and forth. Some people may not get or be turned off by the massive symbolism.

I can see American audiences having problems w/ the film as Alexander as portrayed as pan sexual and in touch with his feminine side.  American heroes are super masculine right now.

Additionally, his parents did a good job of messing him up emotionally, so, some people might see him as weak even though, at his height, he controlled more square miles than the Roman Empire at its height.

Would have liked to have seen the razing of Thebes but they took that out.  Not sure if they did the Gordian Knot routine.

Again, extremely accurate in History compared to most epic films . . . they even used Mary Renault's old books on Alexander for the digging up of ideas.

2310518,3,B0009PLLN6,"The film did have its maginficent CGI, the beautiful costumes and the top-of-the-line cast. More importantly, was from a perspective that tends to portray Persians (Iranians) in a manner that is false and negative. The film also gives a false image of Alexander. I would like to tell readers here about the true nature of Persia and what it was really about and how the filmmakers ignored this real Persia. I would also like to discuss the Nordicism of Alexander. I'm going to offer a brief history on Persia to clarify it's image and then identify the importance of my historical information to the film:

The film opens with a scene in Babylon, Persia and by showing a fan that bares a symbol, a religious point must be made that was completely abandoned by Oliver Stone. The music you hear in the background is actually Persian vocalization, which is a positive thing. Oliver Stone is correct when he refers to the symbol on the fan above the death-bed, when he mentions that it shows the ""link between man and God."" He never mentions that this is a Persian symbol of the Achaemenid Dynasty, a symbol of the sole God, Ahuramazda. Persians were the first monotheists in the world, aside from some ancient Egyptians who worshiped the sun. The Persian Prophet Zoroaster introduced monotheism after the Mazdean religion was revealed to him arguably around 4000 years ago. The religion influenced the future religions, that is, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The religion gave birth to the concept of heaven and hell and the Heavenly Kingdom. The followers of the Mazdean religion had a series of divine text called the Avesta, baring the divine hymns of Zoroaster's revelation called the Gaths. The Avesta was passed through a memorized oral tradition and was eventually written in several volumes in the Ancient Persian language called the Avestan language. The official language of the Achaemenid court was a derivative of Avestan. Avestan is almost identical to Sanskrit (which also originated in Iran).

Anyway, Alexander destroyed 3 of these volumes. He destroyed 3 volumes of a religion's text that simply tells its followers to think good thoughts, do good deeds, and say good words, to act and behave with the intention of good ambition and good thought. The religion also states that the Universe is created good by the Sole God and therefore mankind must behave within the boundaries of good so that the world may be moving positively toward the future. These are the basic guidelines of the religion including the caring of the world and every creation. This is why ancient Iranians (Persians) practiced what is just recently being recognized by the West as ""Green Peace."" Ancient Iranians, because of this religion, believed that since the Universe was created good, then anything that is good on the Earth (such as water, trees, animals) bares the light of God (which is symbolized by fire) and thus must be taken care of. Despite the fact that Alexander destroyed 3 of the volumes of the religious text, the other texts still exist and it is extremely fortunate that this religion is still being practiced all over the World, including in Iran itself. What is shocking and insulting is that Stone completely skips the fact that Alexander destroyed the 3 texts.

An important figure crucial to the image of Alexander and the image of the Persians is Cyrus the Great. Cyrus the Great after he peacefully entered Babylon, long, long before Darius III founded the Achaemenid Dynasty. It is well documented that Cyrus entered Babylon unforcefully with completely peaceful intentions. During Cyrus's time, Mazdeanism was not the dominant religion and idols were worshiped throughout Central Asia. However, Cyrus, upon entering Babylon and declaring himself ruler of Central Asia, also declared and inscripted the very first Declaration of Human Rights known to man! The declaration is known as the Cyrus Cylinder. In the declaration, he states that all religions will be tolerated, slavery will be banned, and women will have equal rights, and so forth. Thus, Cyrus respected the Babylonian Gods and rebuilt the temples, which the former Babylonian king had destroyed. Cyrus helped rebuild Babylon, literally with his own hands! Cyrus then demanded that all Jews must be set free and for this action of his, he is mentioned in the Bible and also in the Torah. The Jews indeed viewed Cyrus as one who was delivered by God to set them free. It was upon these bases of ethics upon which the Achaemenid Empire (infamous Persian Empire) was founded. Though the heirs to the Achaemenid thrown after Cyrus would sometimes, like present world leaders, allow politics to influence their decisions, letting greed, jealousy and obsession guide their paths rather than what Cyrus had declared as the founder of the Empire. And what does this have to do with the film? Alexander pays homage to the tomb of Cyrus the Great, but Oliver Stone skips this significant event! This ruins the image of Alexander and also the Persians. Also, It is a known fact that Alexander destroyed Persepolis, Persia's enormous capital city, while getting drunk with women. Stone skips this event and shows Alexander entering Babylon (present-day Iraq), implying that Babylon was the capital, while Babylon was merely a satrapy of the empire! Stone arrogantly mentions that Alexander had a vision of uniting the world so that one king could rule it. He also mentions that ""there is no other man in history like Alexander. Why arrogantly? Because Cyrus's ethical mission to free the Jews and to unite Central Asia was also a vision of uniting the world! Cyrus did not invision his Empire on the bases of jealousy nor on the bases of revenge, unlike Alexander. Alexander might have been strong, but his intentions were not based on ethics.

Next, the portrayal of the Greeks compared to the Persians at the battle of Guagamela is unfare and untrue. The film shows the Greek army at Guagamela as disciplined ranks, moving as an orderly troupe. On the other hand, the Persian army, according to Dr. Farrokh of Persian studies is portrayed as a huge ""amorphous mob."" The truth of the matter is that the Persian army was highly sophisticated. For instance, Persian war attire was designed according to rank: variations of purple, magenta, black, yellow, burgundies, and saffron were used to dye fabrics with detailed patterns according to the rank of the individual. A group of foot soldiers, for example, would wear the same costume. The Persians were absolutely not a mob and were in fact more organized than the great Greeks. The Persians used a decimal system, which was unknown to the Greeks then, to form and organize the army in groups of 10, 100s, 1000s, and 10,000s. Another significant and outstanding aspect of the Persian army was the use of musical instruments, large drums and horns, to guide the marching tactics of the army. Stone only shows the Greeks with instruments during the war! Persians would indeed prepare for war by training, while Stone has Alexander say in the film to the Persians ""You shall be given a proper Greek education and military training."" This line is absolutely insulting because it is a bold lie. First of all, Greece had a reputation of plagiarizing Central Asian and Egyptian sciences. For example, the Pythagorean theorem was not invented by Pythagoras but by an Egyptian (an incident which is described in the book History of the Persian Empire by A.T Olmstead)! An ancient Persian war exercise which is dated to the Achaemenid times, and is still practiced in Iran, consists of the soldiers practicing with their weapons and weights in organized circles and groups, moving to the beat of drums! Although today this is an art practiced as an exercise. I hope you're beginning to see that the Persians were far from barbarians. Fortunately, Herodotus admits this once finally entering Central Asia and so does Alexander in the film. In the film, Alexander also makes it clear to his men that Central Asia is far older and experienced than Greece. Also, the film shows Arab camel-riders in the front of the Persian army. This is completely untrue. Arabs were situated at the end and were only foot soldiers. They were famous for their brutality and thus were not favored by the Persian leaders.

To give yet another clarification of the strength and superiority of Persia, I'll mention that Persia did not continue to be Hellenized and it recovered its unique culture with the rise of the Parthian Empire, much after Alexander's Selucid rule. During the Sassanid Dynasty of Iran (after the Parthians) the Persian army was the strongest in the world. When Alexander invaded, Greeks were militarily superior with respect to armaments, tactics and military training, because of the gradual weakening of the Persian Empire. But when the Sassanid Dynasty rose, this imbalance was changed. According to Dr. Farrokh: ""The Iranian Savaran (elite Cavalry) successfully halted and defeated many of the later Greek-Hoplite inspired Roman armies. Many Romans attempted to imitate Alexander and failed against Persia. These include Marcus Lucinius Crassus at Carrhae, Marc Anthony at Tabriz (where he failed twice), Gordian III at Mesiche, Phillip the Arab near modern Syria, Valerian at Barbablissos, and Julian the Apostate in Mesopotamia."" These invading Europeans merely picked up some influences such as the astonishing war tactics of Persia, musical instruments, painting on glass, and other cultural things. Byzantium owes much of its ideas to the Sassanid Persians, a point made by Dr. Farrokh in his upcoming book, Sassanian Elite Cavalry.

A few points must be discussed about the film's portrayal of ancient Persian women. Rosario Dawson is a talented and beautiful actress, but she does not resemble a Persian at all. Rosario plays the Queen Roxanne who was from the Northern Iranian tribe called the Sarmatians, of whom descendants survive in the Caucasus and Russia as the Ossetians. Those parts of Russia, such as Tajikestan, Uzbekistan, still consider themselves as Iranians and speak Persian! They were once part of Iran as were Pakistan and Afghanistan! Anyway, Roxanna, in Persian is ""Rukhshwan"" which means, ""fair skinned and illuminant face."" Dawson is dark-skinned! Such blond hair and blue eyed tribes still exist throughout Iran and Afghanistan. A high percentage of Iranians have auburn hair and light colored eyes. Southern Iranians may be darker. Roman sources indicate that the Northern Iranians were indeed blond and fair. The early Aryan settlers were as well. And the idea of Persian Women wearing veils in the movie must be discussed. This is true, however, Persian Women wore veils as a symbol of high status only. They meant that the woman was of a high or royal status. The film takes place in pre-Islamic Persia of the 3rd century B.C when veils were NOT used to ban women from society! The veil worn by Roxanne in the wedding scene is false. This veil is like a Burka. Burkas came with the coming of Islam and this is PRE-ISLAMIC Persia. Women played important roles in leading and managing political and economical areas of the empire. Women live independently and were allowed to divorce their husbands as is documented. They had workers working under them in agricultural and political fields. Women were also trained to fight in the army, in Persia! As I mentioned earlier, Persians highly believed in the equality of men and women because of the ethics of Mazdeanism.

Lastly, I would like to discuss the Nordicism of Alexander. Alexander was a Macedonian. Macedonians had clearly non-Nordic physical features as is proven through the famous Pompeii Mosaic which is considered by scholars to be an accurate rendition of an original Hellenistic painting of the 3rd century BC. The Mosaic depicts a brown haired Alexander with tan skin. Much time has been devoted to the appearance of Alexander by scholars, of which apparently was taken no time to consider by the filmmakers. This is however the common Western tendency to Nordicize important figures, including Jesus Christ whom scientists have recently reconstructed the image of to reveal a dark-haired Aramaian. We must acknowledge that Jesus was not Nordic but Aramaic who would have resembled modern Fertile Crecent Arabs or Jews. Significantly, using blondness and Nordicism to characterize historical figures who had a position of power is a clever way of convincing our future generations that whichever group bares Nordic features is superior any other. From a philanthropic perspective, this may be considered racism at its worst. If not racism, it is, as the little evidence I have mentioned above indicates, a huge lie. This lie is influenced by many factors including politics. It is well proven through historical evidence which will take too much time to discuss here that Western and Interior Europeans owe much of what they have learned in regards to civilization, culture, and identity to the Ancient Greeks and the Greeks to Central Asians. According to Dr. Farrokh:

""with their adoption of Greco-Roman culture, west European scholars in particular, have essentially affected a 'Nordic makeover' of the ancient Greeks and Romans. As Western culture has adopted the mantle of ancient Greece, it has also adopted Alexander as its own son; to the point that Alexander and ancient Greece are viewed as identical with ancient Western Europe and Scandinavia."" The inhabitants of Greece and Western Europe were different in respects to appearance and even body language. Why don't we see the actors using a lot of hand gestures while speaking like the Greeks and Persians themselves? This is an example of the West's preoccupation with their own behavior and characteristics.

Well, the filmmakers failed to consider these extremely crucial points before daring this film. They could have had a much more touching film. The filmmakers however did not fail at all to go into depths about Alexander's to Alexander's trisexual (man, woman and eunuch) love life, which may have carried a message, but was much less important than accurately recreating history. But then sex and lies has been the foundation of Hollywood.",1123977600,5,14222,5.063993174061434
2310519,5,B0009PLLN6,"At first I figured all the negetive reviews were just plain ol' homophobia; no surprise. Eventually there were so many negetive reviews that I assumed it must just be a lousy movie with or without the homosexuality.  BUT I just saw it and enjoyed from beginning to end, and wonder if I should return to my initial conclusion. Homophobia, meaning a severe fear of homosexuality, may be the wrong word. I think a lot of people simply are not at home with homosexuality, can't relate to it, and feel uncomfortable with it. This is not as limited at opposing it or violently hating it. (Do you think homosexuals have the same reaction to heterosexual roles in movies?)

Anyway, I realize this is not the only issue, but this movie is pretty run of the mill good like so many similiar movies these days. Troy, Braveheart, Last Samarai...what is so different or great about those?",1123891200,5,874,4.6688311688311686
2310520,5,B0009PLLN6,"To start off, I can understand why people initially hated this movie. When I first watched it and it ended, the best reaction I could manage was ""Uhh...okay, that was...interesting."" That's my way of saying it was okay, but not that good. But there was something nagging in my mind that kept telling me to look at it again, to look deeper.

I didn't watch the movie again until it came out on DVD, and by that point, the director's cut was what I was presented with. The new version of the movie is restructured to make it flow more smoothly with some scenes added, some dropped. And indeed, it does seem easier to watch than when I saw it in theaters.

When I watched the movie, it recaptured something I realized when I was walking out of the movie theater the first night I had viewed it: it was brilliant. Absolutely, undeniably brilliant. To get to the heart of it in a single word, the movie was about love, in all of its ambiguous forms. Alexander's love for his father, his mother, Hephaistion, and most poignantly, his love of glory. Maybe that seems too romantic to those people who expected a war film bloated with brutality and death, but Alexander was too complicated a man to be reduced to the single role of 'warrior'.

An old Ptolemy, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, narrates the life of Alexander the Great, and one must realize that this narration is essential to understanding many of the complexities of that life. Played with enigmatic passion by Colin Farrell, Alexander is explored as a man of deep, inner conflicts. His seductive and manipulative mother, Queen Olympias, brought to life by the beautiful Angelina Jolie, pushes her son to heights of glory beyond fear or doubt. The tension is portrayed well by Farrell and Jolie, as is their closeness. The father, King Philip, is played by Val Kilmer and the actor plays the promiscuous, drunken, emotionally unstable character well, showing a very different kind of tension betweeen Alexander and his father. Farrell delivers a line that explains it well enough: ""My mother thought me divine, my father weak.""

That line was given to Hephaistion, played by Jared Leto. Leto, having to fill a very mysterious, yet important role, is magnetic in a way that many people fail to notice. To explain this, one must indefinitely mention the arena of Alexander's pan-sexuality. Alexander successfully conquered most of the known world, and yet people are worrying about who he slept with. Conclusion: a bit on the shallow side, but it is, of course, the prerogative of the viewer to swim on that side of the pool.

In the movie, Hephaistion is the long-haired man who is always close to Alexander, watching events with a piercing, blue-eyed gaze. Roger Ebert said that Hephaistion is in the background too much, considering how close he was to Alexander, but I think this works well. If you look closely at Hephaistion during different scenes, you realize that Alexander needs him and that the subtlety of this need actually enhances this premise. Three scenes that come to mind are Alexander and Hephaistion on the balcony (duh), the brawl with Cleitus, and the momentary conflict between Alexander and Kassander before Alexander's marraige to Roxane, the exotically beautiful girl played by Rosario Dawson. Not only do these scenes reinforce this idea, but its significance cannot be ignored when you take two other things into account. The Egyptian ring, given to Alexander by Hephaistion and worn on the ring finger of Alexander's left hand--hmmm... I wonder what that might signify, since MARRAIGE isn't a dead giveaway. Also, Hephaistion's death, which parallels the death of Alexander's dream and initiates the onset of an irreversible loneliness.

The love between them, a love that goes deeper than physical desire, keeps Alexander sane because without Hephaistion, Alexander's dreams (rather progressive for his time) lack a certain substance. Alexander confides in Hephaistion as a soulmate, sharing his hopes and dreams. This transcends the sexual aspect that so many people insisted the movie needed in order to validate their love. Again, your perception of this depends on which end of the pool you swim in.

Ultimately, the portrayal of different relationships, the stunning cinematography, the intense battle scenes, and Oliver Stone's extraordinary use of subtlety serve to propel this epic vision of a young man who achieved more before the age of 32 than most of us do in a lifetime. Yes, he was troubled. Yes, he was bisexual, pan-sexual even. Yes, the ideas this movie confronted were controversial and bold in the extreme. But as Virgil so adequately put, ""Fortune favors the bold."" Oliver Stone may not have satisfied the over-analytical minds of critics paid for opinions that focused on such trivial things as Colin Farrell's blonde hair, but his boldness has captured my imagination; maybe it can capture yours.

P.S. Watch the movie with Oliver Stone's commentary; it will give you a better look into the why's and how's of the film. You have to have an open mind to appreciate movies like these and Stone has a knack for creating stories that demand us to approach them in this way.",1123891200,11,5176,4.934557979334099
2310521,1,B0009PLLN6,"Except for the scenic counryside there is nothing of value in this film.

Jolie is humorous as she goes to and fro with her ""accent"". Sometimes its on; sometimes not. Farrell has three things to do and he must do them many times in this movie. Get angry. Look sad. Bellow and cry. He does this over and over and over. And thats the foundation of the story.",1123891200,13,356,4.235294117647059
2310522,4,B0009PLLN6,"I've just finished viewing the full-length DVD of Oliver Stone's Alexander. I chose this over the shorter ""Director's Cut"" because I wanted to see what the cinema audiences saw. My personal opinion was that if anyone could bring the longer-and-larger-than-life story of Alexander to the screen, this is basically it.

I'm astonished that it got such dreadful reviews, particularly in the U.S.  Yes, there are flaws (which I'll get to), but overall, I think the film is to be commended for what it's been able to capture, not for the areas in which it's failed.

The flaws, some (remarkably few) historical; others discretionary:

Historically, there is an inevitable compression of events. There were several attempted mutinies and attempts on Alexander's life which Stone has chosen to compress into just a couple of scenes. Especially the final battle in India, although beautifully filmed, was glaringly unrepresentative: Alexander's near-fatal (some would say eventually fatal) arrow wound was sustained as he vaulted over the city walls, not when he was out battling in a forest. The point being that this act of tremendous (foolhardy?) heroism galvanised the Macedonian troops, who rushed after Alexander and secured a great victory.  Also, Alexander's famous stallion Bucephalus did not die in that battle--although he did die at a ripe old age in India at a later date.

The entire film after the Indian battle scene seems greatly foreshortened: Hephaestion's death seems almost occur almost immediately after the return to Babylon, and Alexander's own occurs seemingly within a fortnight of Hephaestion's (in reality it was about 8 months afterwards, during which time he oversaw a very elaborate, almost godlike, funeral for his boon companion/lover)

All in all, though, I can see why Stone made the choices he did--he's certainly far less guilty of revisionism and editorialising than the screenwriters of many other historical films--both recent and earlier (including the lifeless 1955 version of Alexander The Great with Richard Burton, whose only recommendation for the role was that he was short).

OK.  To the film: Let's get this wierd homophobic thing out of the way.  Most Greeks of that period, including Alexander's father, Phillip, a randy old sod if ever there was one, indulged themselves to a greater or lesser extent with boys.  Where Alexander was different was that he and Hephaestion were very close in age and their emotional bond (who knows when the sexual thing petered out) was lifelong--basically, Hephaestion was Alexander's (soul)mate until they both died.  This is historical fact, not speculation, and Stone deserves credit for not sweeping this under the rug--at least not until the director's cut which, purportedly, reduced the scenes with Hephaestion considerably.

Colin Farrell is terrific as Alexander, ""pocks and all."" He shows the weaknesses, the emotional vulnerablility and insecurities, as well as Alexander's sometimes foolhardy heroic side.  What I miss is that there's a bit too much of Alexander the battling soldier (I know this sounds ironic when there are only two major battle sequences) and a bit too little of Alexander the meticulous planner and administrator.  I suppose scenes of Alexander in his tent issuing edicts and going over paperwork might have bored audiences.

Also, it was, I think, a mistake to flashback to Phillip's death in Macedonia near the end of the film.  A linear narration would have helped audiences follow the story, and Stone could still have used brief flashbacks at psycologically relevant points.

Two minor quibbles: Alexander is said to have been blond and green-eyed. I wish they'd had Farrell wear contact lenses instead of having his very expressive black Irish eyes staring out from under rather sporadically bleached eyebrows; his hair was also bleached in that typical Hollywood manner that assumes all blonds are Scandinavian-fair, instead of being the honey-blond of Greek blonds. Also the accents, commented on by several reviewers, were a distraction.  All of Alexander's fellow Macedonians, including Jared Leto's carefully modulated Hephaestion and Val Kilmer's excellent King Phillip, seemed to speak in more-or-less of an Irish brogue--presumably to match Farrell's own; Angelina Jolie, whose otherwise very effective if strangely ageless Olympias, spoke in a vaguely Russian accent which, I think, was not a wise choice.  Olympias was not from Macedonia, but she was hardly a Soviet war bride.  Who knows how Roxane actually spoke, but the vaguely gutteral accent used by Rosario Dawson is equally distracting.

The film is visually arresting, particularly the Babylonin sets. All in all, other than the somewhat truncated final half (why not make a longer film  la the 4-hour Cleopatra or Lawrence of Arabia? Especially for DVD release) I thought the film was psychologically sound and surprisingly good and well-acted.",1123891200,2,4930,5.349288486416559
2310523,2,B0009PLLN6,"Look, I hate to add to the pile of negative reviews, but I'm thought this was going to be an action, not a bisexual greek love story. Oliver Stone, I think focused a little on being historical accurately, and telling about Alexander's life, that he forgot the conquest part and the whole action thing!!! I really never got why Angelia Jolie, played as Alexander's mother either!!! I will admit the battle at the beggining against the mighty Persians was visually amazing, along with the battle in the forests of India, with stampeding elephants in a great bloody battle!!!

 The movie did indeed show that Alexander was a great military leader, but also had some problems, like becoming a power crazed self centered dicator, while being a bisexual lover, which I really don't want to see a movie about, but I guess it is historically accurate which I gave it credit though!!! Maybe if thaey showed some more action,and made a movie more like ""Troy"", which is a great movie I might add, which has everything Alexander lacks in!!! The actors, did a great job acting, but the story and plot is just off wack and plainly below par!!!

 The movie was just plainly weak, and bland and could have been way better than this, but I will respect it for being historicallly accurate!!! I don't respect it for lack of action, along with the many plot holes!! I also don't mean to put any body down either, by my statements, but I really wanted a action movie!!! The special features on the second disc are pretty much crap as well!!!

 Well, I guess it beats the text book, but I will probably never see it again!!! I suggest, that you might want to rent it before you buy it!!! Most people will rent it once and never want to see it again!!! Some people may enjoy it, it's your choice, but this is not for real action fans!!!

Overall, I will give this a 2/5..... an overall below average and plainly weak movie.

Pros:

-Angelia Jolie is in the movie

-Some nice battle scenes

-Historicaly accurate

Cons:

-I never got why Angelia Jolie played as Alexander's mother!!!

-A bisexual love story......... are you kidding me, that's sick!!

-Lack of action in general, and a plainly rushed movie!!!

-Plainly a bland story, with a lot of plot holes!!!

-Special features aren't that good either!!!

I will not suggest that you buy this movie, ...... I suggest you check out ""Troy"" instead which, was a pretty good movie that is way better than this!!!",1123891200,8,2439,4.606481481481482
2310524,3,B0009PLLN6,"Like most biographical films, this one focuses the first act on the child and the parents. Both characters, though well acted and fascinating seem to be only two dimensional: Philip is a short tempered drunk and Jolie's Olympias is a scheming and manipulative. The film then immediately jumps to Alexander's greatest achievement, the victory at Gaugamala. I can't say anything bad about this battle, though it lacks a lot of weight being so early in the movie. The true history of the massive campaign that leads to the victory is completely glossed over. It would have been nice to focus on the Persian campaign a bit longer in the film, since it was the victory that defined his life; it would have been nice to put it in better context. As is, the battle of Gaugamela is thouroughly visceral and brutal enough to satisfy long ailing epic fans.

But there is one major drawback in all of this: the score. For some reason Oliver Stone, with a massive budget at his disposal, had to go and employ a Greek composer for ""authenticity"". I find that strange since the music in the film is about as vanilla contemporary as any I've heard in a long time. It is also distracting, loud swelling trumpets and cheesy sounding overtures that belong in made for television fare. When I saw Troy, I thought that soundtrack was bad; this is far worse. I should note here that on this DVD version the soundtrack frequently drowns out the dialogue. I can't emphasize enough how irritating the soundtrack is. Watching certain scenes on a second viewing, I would frequently mute it and enjoy the scene in silence.

The film stops for a bit in the city of Bablyon, which is hard to mind considering what a beautiful set it was. Reading historic narratives, Babylon is described as the most beautiful city of its time and I was glad to see how well they captured it. At this point a lot of the movie is spent watching Alexander and his generals quarrel, which gets tiring after a while.

India is where the film really lost me. Here is where Oliver Stone really allowed his personality to dominate the film; he turns India into Viet Nam. India is portrayed as a quagmire: a demorilizing place where they fight guerillas and begin to doubt their mission. The film dawdles here for a while, allowing the various muntiny clichs to appear until we reach the second and final set-piece battle of the film.

The less said about the last fight the better. It is a dramatic and strangely beautiful fight that turns into a mess when Stone decides to saturate the film in an ultra-red hue that drowns out any clarity of what is going on. All I could see was movement and shapes. This struck me as pure egotistical excess on the director's part. This ruined what should have been the climax of the film.

I must say that in all, this was a much more historically accurate film than I was expecting. Far better than the abysmal and soulless Troy, the film still suffers greatly from egotistical directing decisions and doesn't know when to stop. Stone can't resist a good conspiracy either, making it appear that Alexander was poisoned (a rumor that cynics are in love with).",1123804800,3,3143,4.625448028673835
2310525,4,B0009PLLN6,"What can you say about Oliver Stone and his latest epic?  One word might suffice, genius.  Only Stone would attempt such an act.  And in my eyes, he succedes with well crafted brilliance and experience.  Now, with his Director's Cut which is 8 minutes shorter, Stone repositions Alexander's (Colin Farrell) conquests by parralleling his main triumphs with flashbacks of his love/hate affair between parents Phillip and Olympias played by Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie.  By doing so, Stone has managed to give reason to Alexander's motives.  With the Director's Cut, scenes are trimmed down, reshuffled, and some even simply disappear.  Even Ptolemy's (Anthony Hopkins) narration is cut down to the basics.  Stone now allows the viewer more of an opportunity to place the pieces together for themselves.  The only reason this review is four stars is because I wish the film carried a longer running time.  When I saw the theatrical release back in November I did in fact enjoy the film, but I didn't love it.  Being such a huge admirer of Stone I was somehow dissapointed with certain choices he had made and almost felt like I betrayed him somehow by not totally grasping his ideas.  But with the Director's Cut, my 100% faith in Stone has been restored.  Stone is a pure bred filmmaker with raw talent and always keeps his audience guessing what's to come.  ""Alexander"" is no different.  Stone continues to bring out the best with his casts.  Any and every actor who has worked with the man delivers his or her best performance.  Ignore what the critics say and give ""Alexander"" the respect it deserves.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the score by Vangelis is a haunting driving force.  ""Alexander"" is a worthy installment to the career of Oliver Stone.  Like the film says, ""Fortune favors the bold.""",1123804800,2,1811,4.894736842105263
2310526,1,B0009PLLN6,"I wish there was something less than one star in this grading scale.  if there were I'd have given it that! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  And I'm usually pretty generous to movies.

It's not the fault of the cast, which actually had a lot of potential.  It's purely the fault of the director's confused vision.  It is, in fact, hard to see how one could make a boring and disappointing movie about Alexander the Great.  His life was a great and ultimately tragic one on a monumental scale, but you'd never guess it from this movie.  Instead of a reasonably comprehensible story line, we are given vignettes that wander all over the place and backwards and forwards in time.  The few battle scenes are incomprehensible and only Guagamela makes any kind of sense.

I see many reviewers panning or praising because of the bisexual behavior of Alexander.  The facts are historical and certainly not surprising in Greek society.  However, what was depicted in the movie as homosexual behavior was ridiculously chaste, while the heterosexual behavior was ridiculously violent.  Neither were of any importance to the movie's overall effect.  A boring movie with either or both types of sex is still a boring movie.

The costumes and most of the sets are OK and some of the computer generated scenes (of Babylon, for example) are pretty good.

The most worthwhile frames of the entire movie are the computer-generated (and non-historical) clash between Buchepalous (Alexander's horse) and a war elephant.  But it's not worth watching the whole movie just for that scene.

Alas, this is definitely forgettable.  If you really want to get a feel for the life of Alexander, try viewing Michael Wood's ""In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great"".  It has more drama than did this sorry movie, as Wood actually follows the routes taken by Alexander on his amazing journey from Greece to India and gives us an amazing view of the terrible natural obstacles that the Macedonian army had to overcome and the variety of peoples they encountered.  It's easy to see why troops would follow that Alexander to the ends of the earth, Stone's Alexander would have been assassinated before he left Greece.",1123804800,12,2205,4.8449197860962565
2310527,2,B0009PLLN6,"I have no objection to Alexander being portrayed as gay. I have no problem with him being portrayed as flawed, and at times, desperate.

But I do expect Alexander to be portrayed as noble. And nobility is the key quality that Colin Farrell fails to bring to this role. Towards the end of the story, he seems so overwhelmed by suspicions and insecurities, that he behaves like an alcoholic, desperate for his next drink. Unusually, there are a number of Irish accents in this movie.

The film has some good points: the two major battles are done well. The first is particularly educational for those interested in battlefield tactics, with the occasional appearance of on-screen captions such as 'Macedonian Left'. The second is hard for animal lovers to watch, but of course horses did get speared and battle-elephants did get their trunks sliced off. (This sets a high standard for Vinn Diesel's future production of Ross Leckie's 'Hannibal'.)

Only three other comments: firstly, I found the going-back and coming-forward in time irritating. Secondly, I worry about a movie in which, according to the credits, Alexander's mum is the second-most important character in the story.  Thirdly, Vangelis' score is lacklustre.  Vangelis has produced some amazing scores -- e.g. 'Bounty' and 'Chariots of Fire' -- but while other composers of the same generation continue to produce brilliant work (e.g. Hans Zimmer on 'The Last Samurai') Mr Papathanassiou seems utterly stuck.

I just watched it and am at somewhat at a loss why everyone says it was so terrible. Actually, I quite enjoyed it. I thought Colin Farrell did a very credible job of acting as did, actually, the entire cast. I thought the battle scenes were pretty well done, if that's what you're interested in, the homosexuality wasn't glossed over though it was not made a big issue either (nor should it have been). This is a movie about a conflicted man who did some marvelous things and did some terrible things. He was (like most of us) a product of his environment and of his upbringing. I don't know...I liked the movie.  I have to suspect it may have suffered some backlash from ""Troy"". Now, that was DULL.I guess all I can say is try to approach this with an open mind and make your own decision on this. I feel too often that we take a critics opinion as the word of god when in reality it is just one persons opinion. I, personally, enjoy big spectacle movies and this one does the job handily. Also, I feel the story was handled well and the character development was not neglected. All the characters were multidimensional and, I thought, quite believable.  Initially, I thought to myself that there sure were a lot of different accents going on and then it occured to me that in the reality of Alexanders world that was probably also the case. I mean, they all came from different places, didn't they? So I let the accents pass. Again, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Give it a try. Maybe you will, too.",1123718400,5,1633,4.365131578947368

The acting was actually very good and the production quality was excellant. The issue as I saw it was that although it addressed the fact that Alexander was in a intimate relationship with his childhood male friend, it did not do more than hint at the issue. It was understandable that the issue makes many uneasy however I would say that if you are going to address the issue than be factual or say nothing at all. Many films being produced today make us uneasy with how they handle issues. That is what gives them an edge and enhances the viewing. The only issue that I felt did the film disjustice was the scene toward the end when they went to infer-red film in the battle. That was not pulled off successfully.

2310542,1,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone may have lost all of the talent he once appeared to have.  Some of his earlier movies, such as ""Wall Street"" and ""Platoon"", were great movies because they were so well made.  Alexander is very poorly made and is simply a very bad film.

The battle scenes are incredibly poor.  We often see the battle from a birds-eye view, but the warriors are displayed as tiny dots.  I couldn't even tell which side was which during those views.  The hand to hand fighting was also weak.  Overall, these battle scenes were much worse than those in other, recent films.  We often see Alexander, in full headress so everyone knows who he is, wandering around the battle field swinging his sword while the opposition forces are seemingly unaware of his presence.  It was very odd.  Then, we have these slow motion action scenes in which Colin Farrell's eye's are so wide open as to be comical.

Given the well regarded cast, I assumed that the acting would be good.  Instead, I have to assume that Oliver sand bagged almost the entire cast.  The performances we get are so poor that I feel the actors themselves cannot be entirely to blame.  The only praiseworthy perfomance was from Angelina Jolie, who plays the ""evil woman"" role better than any other actress in Hollywood.  She gave me the creeps every time she was on the screen (which was to purpose of her role).  Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, and Christopher Plummer are wasted in this film, although Anthony Hopkins manages to almost break-even with his role.  Poor Colin Farrell.  You can tell that tried really hard, but he appears to overact in almost every scene.  Viewing his often distorted expressions and wide open eyes, I wondered what the director was telling him to do.  He gives an absolutely horrible performance.  I've seen him in various other films, and he's not that bad of an actor.  I have to blame Oliver Stone for this mess.  Rosario Dawson suffers the same fate in this film as Farrell.  I hope her career can recover.

The story is very incomplete, and leaves the viewer wondering what the historical Alexander actually did.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the film was, either.

I wanted to believe that there would finally be a good movie about this worthy subject.  I had to believe that in the masterful hands of Oliver Stone the movie would be well crafted.

Each have failed and been worse than the one before it.

We have had Troy, several other forgettable ones that escape me now and here we have Alexander.

This film should ring the deathbell for ""Sword and Sandle"" movies for awhile.

I won't repeat what others have said here, but all I can add is that after watching this for 3 hours with friends.... when it was over we all looked at each other and commented...........

""That was painful to watch wasn't it"".

To which the reply was.... ""Oh I thought I was the only one that felt that way, if I knew you guys had the same feeling I would have suggested ejecting the DVD 2 hours ago !""

Definatley not a movie that draws you in.

When you see a great well done movie, you can almost forget for awhile you are watching a movie with actors playing a part and feel what you are seeing is real............ but with Alexander you FEEL like you are watching Colin Farrell play the part of a historic figure and in fact the whole film feels strained and forced like it just never got itself together.

It's obvious alot of work and effort went into this film and for this I feel sorry for alot of the folks in it, because for all that effort it still falls flat and will probably be remembered as a cinematic failure.

Unless you are an absolute fan of the historical figure Alexander, steer clear of this film.

In fact even if you are a big fan of Alexander the Great, you make wish to steer clear of this film as it tends to highlight his faults, failures and weakneses over his strengths and actually diminishes his historical significance to the point of making him appear irrelevent.

Usually in a historical film like this you get MORE interested in the focal character and afterwards want to go out and buy a book or find more information about them........ with Alexander,during the last 45 minutes of the film my wife and I were whispering to each other....... ""Die already""

Afterwards our friends admitted they were thinking the same thing to themselves.

One of my friends who is not very historically knowledgable asked me afterwards.... ""Hey Mike, why is he called Alexander the Great anyway ? Unless they skipped over it in this film, he really didn't accomplish much afterall did he except run his people ragged on some warped vision he had ?""

Not the effect I imagine the producers and director were going for.",1123718400,15,2620,4.5073995771670194
2310545,2,B0009PLLN6,"I've definately seen better movies than this. ""Troy"" may have played with history and some facts but at least it sort of had a plot, good direction, and kept you hooked throughout. This though, this is long. Scenes seem to be out of place and you'll get whiplash simply trying to keep up; they'll go from showing him as a young child to a teenager, then a grown man. They leave out parts of the story to be brought up later, which is rather distracting when those scenes last for what feels like forever, and you're jerked back into the present or back to the past.

The only thing appealing about this movie is perhaps the Hollywood glamour. Watching Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell is great, but when they both look the same age and you're supposed to accept Jolie as Alexander's mother? There's nothing really engaging about the plot or script. The dialogue is either weak or mumbled through, making the movie feel truly long and rather dull. I personally didn't have a problem with Alexander being portrayed as bisexual. What I did have a problem with is that as other reviewers have said, it wasn't handled well. It was at times over the top. The men he was attracted to were all made out to be femenine, which may have been the case, but there's no historical basis for this and it's a bit offensive to think that the only type of man that could have been appealing to Alexander ""the Great"" were femenine. Why did he feel attracted to men? Why wasn't there more of a focus on his children, or his military strategy. He just seemed ... confused. Overly emotional.

Well, as for special features ... there are the theatrical trailers, and there's a behind-the-scenes documentary featuring Oliver Stone and a look at the filming and setbacks that occured during the movie. Even it was poorly done. People's voices are muffled, it's hard to understand what's being said, it drags on, not much more is added to the film. I was hoping to hear why Stone chose to shoot the movie as he did. Why he chose to focus on Alexander's sexuality more so than his other attributes. If he gave an explanation, it was lost in all his muffled and jarbled speaking, and his cursing.

This film definately makes the other epic films of the past few years stand out more and shine like great works of art. It lacks good direction, should have been edited differently, and the actor's accents (among many other things) are just inconsistant and makes this look like it was rushed through production and all. It's an okay movie, I'm not sure if it's worth purchasing, but it's okay. There's a director's cut that's supposed to be better edited with scenes re-arranged (a sign that this original cut wasn't really well-thought out and perhaps rushed out to theaters before beign produced right).

I'd be wary to suggest anyone purcahse this. It's a weak movie that really doesn't engage the audience in the story. It doesn't setup or play out the characters that well and the scenes are oddly placed and arranged throughout the movie. Something else I found a bit distracting is that you have to get up in the middle of the movie just to change discs to see the entire film. Beware of what you're getting. If you're a fan of Colin Farrell, I'm sure you'll find this movie decent, but it's not his best work. Enough said, I suppose.",1123632000,13,3312,4.589527027027027
2310546,4,B0009PLLN6,"First off it should be pointed out that this movie is strictly for History and not for Hollywood.  In the film it accurately portrays the Greek lifestyle, and circumstances written in books about Alexander.  This movie recieved low ratings from critics however, because the story wasn't altered in any way to meet the needs of someone who doesn't care to first read alittle into the life of Alexander. One thing missing for me in the movie was his conquest of Egypt.  Yes, they showed Ptolemy(Anthony Hopkins) in a scene posed at the Library of Alexandria, but they didn't show how he over ran Egypt to bring the first European settlement, as a whole country, to Africa. This is very important, because of all the places he over ran, and conquered, Egypt became the greatest. By conquering Egypt he set up the biggest trade port for medical, philisophical and material purposes. Now, Egypt was already one of the greatest ports, seeing as all of the  greatest Greek thinkers from  Theles, Plato, Hippocrates, Pythagoras, Diodoros, and Herotodus all came and learned from the Egyptians, before Alexander, and applied Egyytian customs to their philosophies. Still, after the Greeks came to Egypt, and applied their worldly aspect with the ""Old and Grey"" Egypt , Alexandria was exploited and the greatest scholars of the world, from all over came to Egypt, in even more vast numbers, to learn from the papyrus texts, taken from Egyptian temples, and hyroglyphs at the Library of Alexandria. Many religions took, and applied Egyptian concepts to their own religion and culture.  Even the Old Testament was compiled at the library of Alexandria(200B.C).When you look at it this was a big point left out of the movie that should have been dealt with in greater detail.  Still, overall the movie was good, with very intense accuracy.  Evidence of this can be seen in phrases like, ""You go to conquer Persia, but you get can't get from one couch to the next.""  Alexander said this to Phillip when he was drunk at the party.  Also, the sacrafice made on the bull before his battle with the Darius III and the Persians. The Greeks honored their gods with sacrafices every battle.  When the sacraficed was made they showed the blood splash over Alexander's face.  I don't think that was in the theatrical version, but it was on the Director's cut DVD.  In the end this movie held back on no aspects of Greek culture EVEN THE ONES ALITTLE PAINFUL TO THE EYES.",1123632000,,2447,4.81145584725537

2310548,2,B0009PLLN6,"I disagree with the review below because this is pretty much the best I've seen Colin Farrel act.  He showed great emotion, strength and weakness when it was called for through the entire movie.  Val Kilmer showed up and did a pretty good job as the abusive father.  Hopkins was alright as a narrator.  Both Jared Leto and Rosario Dawson played what they could out of their small parts that were stretched thru the whole movie.

The worst out of all these were Angelina Jolie.  Stunning beauty but horrible acting job.  The grotesque Russian accent she uses is something out of an old James Bond/comic book movie.  You hardly notice anything but the accent!

The movie jumped all the over the place and a timeline was pretty much non-existent.  You will be confused.  The big story for this movie is all the on-screen homosexual activity.  I can understand that Oliver Stone wanted to be accurate but some of it was just too much.  If you can stomach watching this then you will be alright.  Otherwise I would pass and personally I want the 3-4 hours of my life back that I spent watching this.

I give this movie 2 stars strictly off the great job that Colin did and the CGI was superb (especially at Babylon).  What is great about Gladitor and Braveheart is that you can watch those movies over and over again.  This is not a classic and Alexander is not that Great.",1123632000,10,1368,4.518367346938776
2310549,4,B0009PLLN6,"I was almost expecting to be disappointed by this movie because of all the critic bashing of it I'd seen.  This is a good movie with many memorable scenes.  I believe the director's cut also flows better than I believe the original version did.  The DC version first establishes Alexander as the man he was - conqueror, leader, inspirer of men, strong willed.....and then, reverts back to him as a young man before his father was assasinated.  I must say, some of the bad reviews on I've seen here seem downright juvenille.  It's okay not to like a movie and say why but to resort to some of the things I've seen makes

me doubt the validity of the message itself.

  Anyway, Colin Ferrell did a good job........maybe a bit of overacting here and there.  And I can see where some critics say he came off as a 'crybaby'.....but that was maybe just one small scene.  All in all his acting is passionate and he projects the leadership and drive the real man must have had.  The battle of Galgamela.....awesome and worth the price of admission.  Other telling and memorable scenes were - Alexander showing all he could ride the horse Bucephalus....Phillip taking his son on a tour of the cave to recount the history of the titans and gods.  The wedding celebration where Alexander is insulted by a guest and then berated by his father.  The battle in India.......all great scenes and well done by Mr. Stone.  Some themes in the movie were a bit overdone I thought...sexuality here and there....and perhaps his mother like snakes a bit too much.....but this is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  All in all  a good movie which closely parallels his real life.  Powerful scenes that are well complimented by Vangelis' musical score.  Worth the time to watch and if you don't know anything about Alexander, you may be saying as my wife did as we watched the battle where Alexander drove Darius from the battlefield.....""

2310561,3,B0009PLLN6,"Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is one long, messy picture. Half of the scenes work, half don't, no two people would probably agree on which, and that's not  to say it's unwatchable. It's a $150 millon bloated epic, with passion and philosophy ""Troy"" and ""Gladiator"" never attended to. Stone quite clearly aimed for a modern ""Lawrence of Arabia."" He failed. But it's a worthy error.

Alexander The Great, the Macedonian/Greek conquerer, took kingship after the murder of his father Philip, claimed all of Persia at 25, ruled in the hanging gardens of Babylon, and stretched his empire 10,000 milles to India. He never lost a military battle. He was most likely poisoned by some of his closest advisors who had been denied their return home after seven years and 50 small wars. He died at 32.

The outline is important because, for one, Stone employs a narrator in Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to tell us these things, and he has to fill in the rest of the blanks and dramatize certain relationships, such as that between the adult Alexander (Colin Ferrell) and his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed her son was not borne of King Philip (Val Kilmer) but Zeus himself. Olympias is presented as a Lady MacBeth with a Russian accent and a inferiority complex; we get the sense, really, that she would have preferred to have been born a man and king herself. Philip is a drunk and a lout, but beloved by his army. Driven by vengeance and bloodlust and not destiny, there is a gulf between he and Alexander, between a professional and a prodigy.

In Alexander, Stone creates an arrogant, passionate, insecure man, given to fits and bawling, shows of affection and cruelty, greatness and shame. Stone admits Alexander's pansexualism - he ""loved"" boyhood friend Hephiaston (Jared Leto), Asian bride Roxanna (Rosario Dawson) and a eunuch - but does not push it. Most of all, Stone insists on Alexander's ambition to explore and push farther from home and the known world, for reasons he never quite reveals, although he is haunted by his mother's taunts, and his father's legacy.

Because ""Alexander"" genuinely means to say something about the commonality of man vs. our tendencies to side with like skin and dialect, it's a very talky, stagelike film - long speeches, a couple roundtable sequences. Stone gives us two battles - the second of which, in India, belongs in any conversation about great war scenes - elephants, natives emerging in the jungle, and a dramatic color shift. The first battle at Gaugamela, for Persia, is confusing, muddled game capture the flag, an ancient ""Blitz to Baghdad,"" if you will. Like our three-week campaign Iraq, this strategy eventually fuels a long-running argument between Alexander and his generals. Alexander alone dreams to trailblaze to the ""outer ocean."" The rest want their lives, their family, and to enjoy the spoils of their victories.

At times Ferrell seems overwhelmed by the role of Alexander; most actors would be, it asks for such a range of emotions. But he does give the conquerer a perspective, a bemused intelligence in quieter moments, a bawling rage in others. In the last hour of ""Alexander,"" the conquerer is quite clearly losing it and Ferrell charts the descent well. Ferrell is an performer, not a method actor, so when he goes for it, he does so with instinct. Recent epic heroes Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"") Orlando Bloom (""Kingdom of Heaven"") and Tom Cruise (""The Last Samurai"") have a lot more zen, even machismo, than Alexander.

That Ferrell overacts in scenes as son to Olympias and Philip is not entirely his fault. Jolie would rather be seen as impressive than talented; she's an action star so fixated on cool she may never return to the land of subtlety. Her performance is pitched to a junior-high acting class on cartoon accents. I half-expected her to slither or crawl at some point, she's so unhinged. And Kilmer - though simply doing the best he can - is wrong for Philip. His greatness is told, not shown. It does not help that his performance is broken into flashbacks so scattered we can forget what we already know of him.

The entire production is scattered, from Stone's fractured structure to the occasional incantation of the Greek gods - it's hard to say whether they matter to Alexander or not - to Dawson's rare and rather pointless appearances as Roxanna. ""Alexander"" could have been an hour longer and been incomplete; what's odd is that the DVD ""Director's Cut"" version is actually shorter. The movie may be Stone's rubicon - producers should never trust him with a movie of great scale again.",1123545600,8,4584,4.890604890604891
2310562,1,B0009PLLN6,"Please save your self from this theatrical tragedy. First of all this movie was boring and seemed like 6 hours instead of 3. I went to the movie with my friend and his family; half way through the movie his father had his head back, mouth open, and he was snoring loud. Unlike him I decide to give the movie a chance hoping that it would get better it never did. What was wrong with it? Where do I begin? 1. Horrible accents I heard German accents, Scottish accents, and Jolie had a Russian accent. 2. The fighting scenes were the worst I have ever seen period. The first one was blurry and I couldn't tell who won until Anthony Hopkins told us. The best thing about the second fight scene was the elephants, and the costumes. The fighting performance was nowhere near that of Gladiator, or Troy and that was really disappointing. I was waiting for brilliantly choreographed fight scenes; instead I got a huge blur and elephants. 3. The movie didn't show why Alexander was great. From what I saw he was more obsessed in is love life. This movie depicted him as a weak, love obsess puppet whose mother was pulling the all the strings; instead displaying his strategic genius that made him great in the first place.

2310563,1,B0009PLLN6,"Ok if you believed any of this tripe I have a suggestion for the re-make.  You cast Elton John as Alexander.  If you are going to make him gay then make him out of the closet Liberace gay.  Not the ham-handed attempt done in this film.  He won't actually fight in any battles but his song will inspire his men or his Muppets.  In a weird twist Miss Piggy will be one of the wives but they will both be after Kermit the Frog the young warrior.  Kermit will be straight and won't have anything to do with either of them.

The rest of the Muppet cast will serve as Alexander's army.  The cranky old guys will rip on this movie but will be forced to concede that the Muppet version of the movie is much better than this farce.

You will need someone to play Alexander's mom.  Let's see Elton John is old so lets cast Britney Spears in that role.  That ought to bring some bubble headed nonsense to mirror Angelina Jolie's role.  For Philip of Macedon that will be hard.  Val Kilmer actually put some effort into bringing that role to life.  Maybe Al Pacino would take part.  He would turn his utterly ridiculous role into an Oscar worthy performance.

For the elephant battle maybe Sesame Street would lend us Mr. Snuffleupagous and his family.  Of course he would not get hurt as would no one else.

I could keep going.  This movie would be laughable if it were not for the fact that people actually believe it and liked it.",1123545600,5,1421,4.3143939393939394
2310564,2,B0009PLLN6,"Watching this was sort of a strange experience. I didn't see it at the theaters because of all the bad reviews. I didn't expect it to be good, and yet I knew I had to see it anyway. What's strange is that in some ways it's hard to put a finger on why it fell so flat. There are some obvious things, like casting Colin Farrell, like all the Celtic accents and like Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, with a rather bizarre accent of her own. There's the awkward effort to make this relevant to our times. It's hard not to look at Darius and not see some sort of Middle Eastern terrorist type. And then when Alexander chooses to chase him through the Hindu Kush in a guerilla war it's too close a parallel to Bin Laden at Tora Bora to dismiss. I know this is true to the events, but it's a problem when a filmmaker seems to want to sell his project by appealing to our very contemporary political prejudices. But still, none of these are what was disappointing to me. It's okay to take issue with a film if it has some life, but this one didn't.

I couldn't even really get outraged by how bad it was. Troy had me aghast at how the filmmakers butchered The Iliad. King Arthur was laughable in its earnestness to totally rewrite Arthurian lore. I didn't like those films at all, but there was almost something enjoyable about how bad they were. That's not the case here. It's clear that Oliver Stone took himself very seriously here. He wanted to make a big, important film, and never admits throughout this that this is really kitsch entertainment. That's the failure. A bad film that sort of pokes you in the ribs playfully is one thing, but when you want people to seriously be moved by actors with inappropriate accents, bad hair dye jobs, grandiose and contradictory proclamations... Well then it's tricky ground. Stone didn't navigate it well at all this time around.",1123545600,,1872,4.473684210526316
2310565,4,B0009PLLN6,"Being an avid Alexander fan, I waited breathlessly for this movie to come out, and was disappointed by what I wanted to see, but wasn't there.  Now after viewing the release of the theatrical version for the third time I realize that the film is really a lot better than I'd previously allowed myself to believe.  One of the problems with the Alexander's legacy is that he is so many things to so many different people, and there is no one way to view this man. To put the story of his incredible personality and career together, plus please everyone who has any interest in him, negative and/or positive, you have a tough job ahead of you.  But I do think that Stone did manage to do a better than expected job.  True, those of us who love the unconquerable Macedonian King will never have enough, unless somehow time machines are invented and we can all make reservations to visit Alexander ourselves.  Barring that feat Stone takes us there in the only way he knows how, through his imagination.  After all this is an Oliver Stone film, he's the creative force behind it.  Yes, for fans of the Alexander-Hephastion story it was a little disappointing. I'm sure if other films on Alexander are produced they will bear a different view, based on their creator's vision. I would have liked a greater scope presented through supporting characters, Hephastion would have been one of the best to help the viewer understand just why this young man, Alexander of Macedon has so astounded and held the world enthralled for centuries.  But Stone didn't leave us out in the cold, the battle scenes are fantastic!  Esp. the scenes at Gaugamela! The scenes of a victorious Alexander and his army riding into Babylon are simply breathtaking, as are some of the scenes at Pella. We get to live that charge along with Alexander, Stone allows us to share for a moment in the greatness of Alexander's myth and drive.  I for one am grateful for anyone who can take on this historical giant, because Alexander was just that a giant in his own time.  Stone gives us a gift, and a beautifully filmed one at that, however you chose to view it in stepping up to the plate to add one more piece to the puzzle that was Alexander the Great.  For the three hours of this film we get to be with Alexander and share in his glory.  This is not a recreation of a history lesson.  Stone is in the business of creating and entertaining and for me he did just that.  For anyone who is in love with Alexander you should see this film, as it is one step closer toward understanding the legend of a genius. Whatever the film's faults, and yes, there were some, the jumping back and forth in the movie to different times in Alexander's life at times seemed out of context and could have been a bit more seamless, and there were some truly major events in his life that I felt should have been included to make the story clearer to viewers who aren't familiar with the story. But I won't complain too much. In the end each of us has an Alexander that is alive for us, and no one can ever make them all the same, but Stone does invite us in to visit his fantasy and I for one enjoyed the stay.",1123459200,7,3155,4.424870466321243

The plot is a mess. Stone can't decide who Alexander is. He's not terribly brilliant a commander - or is he? He can't seem to inspire his men - or can he? And when he does, is it on purpose? And when he fails, with a limpid speech, is that really him, or not? And what of his grand vision? Not much of that shown. And he can't persuade his men that it's a grand vision.

Not that I blame them. Colin Farrell looks ridiculous in his half-blond hair and nostrils flaring. It just distracts from the film and makes you think, couldn't they have spent more on makeup?

Only Val Kilmer is somewhat worth watching in his limited role as King Philip. The battle scenes are not as good as some reviews would have you expect, although the sight of charging elephants is somewhat awesome; and that crimson effected battle is just an eyesore.

It fails to capture Alexander's vision and triumph, and portrays him as a boyish simperer. Yuck.",1123459200,19,1082,4.3681592039801

Most annoying problems.

1. If you're going to have one set of people.. please have them all use the same sort of accent.  The many different accents was distracting and made the movie cartoonish.

2. If Alexander was bi-sexual, fine.  Let's not spend extra time on an already long and boring movie for loving gazes to his many love interests.  If you have to do it, at least make it interesting.

3. The battle scenes were horrible.  Blurry and muddled.  There was no battle plan for the filming and at no point during the movied did I actually care what was going on.  Just another battle.  blah blah.

4. The rousing (sarcastic) speech by the leader of whatever group it is, riding up and down the front battleline supposedly rousing the troops.. how many times is this going to be shown?  If you have to do it, it better be a good one.  This one roused me to go to the bathroom during it.

5. Long.  It's just too long and not interesting enough to keep you satisfied.  I actually came away from this movie not knowing that much about Alexander.  Anything I learned pretty much was what Anthony Hopkins told us.. and that was very boring as well.

There is a great deal of talking, speechifying and narration throughout. Not appropriate for an  action film about the conquest of the then known world. The best film makers ""show us"" rather than ""tell us"", as Ridley Scott did in Gladiator, a film which Oliver Stone could have learned something from. Anthony Hopkins narration brought to mind the snowman, voiced by Burl Ives, who narrated Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer! There were also too many flashbacks. A more linear telling of the story would have worked better. The battle scenes in this movie were also incomprehensible. I had no idea who won or what was going on. As for the actors, Colin Farrell really lacked the gravitas to play Alexander. Russell Crowe had me convinced he was a warrior in Gladiator. In this film, Colin Farrell did not. It was hard to see why anyone would follow him into battle. Rosario Dawson is an attractive actress, but in this film plays a woman from Bactria, which is in present day Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. She bears no physical resemblance to anyone from that region. And what was with Angelina Jolie's accent?

After several friends of mine saw the film and hated it, their reasons were vast and shared by many, here are a few examples of their complaints; too slow, too much focus on homosexuality (Alexander the Great was believed to have been bisexual which was common among Greeks, yet this film paints him as only being gay), there's no sense of a greater destiny for the character, horrible editing and time jumps, just to name a few.  But for the DVD release Warner Brothers announced that Oliver Stone had re-edited his would-be epic film and now it is about 30 minutes shorter, much faster paced with more action, and a more balanced view of his sexuality (basically giving more screentime to Rosario Dawson as his wife, Roxanne).  So like an idiot I took the bait, and rented ""Alexander: The Director's Cut"", now since I never saw the theatrical release I can't say how much faster paced this version was, but to me the pace was excruciatingly slow and still focused too heavily on homosexuality.  But that's enough gripes for now, let's move on to the outline for the story and then I'll gripe some more at the end, but I do have a few good things to say as well for the film, so please read on.

""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" follows the life and conquests of the man history has dubbed `Alexander the Great'.  Alexander was born of royal blood, his father was King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), a rough, womanizing, drunk of a man; and his mother was Olympia (Angelina Jolie) who many believed to be a mystic and whom herself believed to be a descendant of the gods.  With parents like these Alexander was destined to be somewhat messed up, yet he managed to overcome these two powerfully controlling forces and become one of the greatest leaders and military tacticians of all time.  After the death of King Philip, Alexander assumes the throne and sets off on a quest to conquer the known world.  From the deserts of Afghanistan and Persia to the lush forests of Asia, Alexander's ingenuity for military tactics enabled him to defeat almost any foe he encountered.

Now this story sounds intriguing, but Oliver Stone manages to butcher it with terrible editing and time jumps through Alexander's life.  In one moment Alexander is a teenager, the next we're 20 years into the future and he has already conquered several countries.  Also though no sexually explicit scenes between men were shown it was heavily implied, especially between Alexander and his best friend Hephastion (Jared Leto).  This strong overtone of homosexuality wouldn't have been so distracting if it wasn't in every single scene, plus the fact that Alexander is believed to have been bisexual meaning there should have been more focus on the women of Alexander's life.  And yet another problem was that you really don't care for Alexander, in epic films like this you should care for what is going to happen to the central character, whether he lives or dies, whether he will triumph or fail.  In this movie I found myself not caring at all, I would have been fine if Alexander would have died during the first battle, at least the movie would have been over sooner.  Truthfully, the most interesting characters in the film, and the ones I wanted to know more about were Alexander's parents, King Philip and Olympia.  That alone tells you how much of a failure this film is for Oliver Stone.

Many people gripe that the casting was all wrong, actually I felt the casting was great, Colin Farrell was very good as Alexander, he just didn't have much to work with, and Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie were outstanding as the controlling parents of history's greatest conqueror.  The casting was not what made this movie fail, as I have alluded to in my complaints of this movie, the biggest reason for ""Alexander"" failing at the box office and on DVD is none other than Oliver Stone himself.  Oliver Stone is known for making very complex and engaging movies, and for loving controversy which is probably why he infused so much homosexuality in this movie.  If Stone would have just gotten beyond his penchant for controversy and focused more on Alexander's conquests rather than his much debated love life, this film could have been the grand epic it aspired to be.

""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",1123459200,,4680,4.7422934648582
2310575,5,B0009PLLN6,"I was prepared to skewar this edition.  I liked the theatrical release (and I bought both versions on DVD), and I had heard that the director's cut was going to be butchered and/or dumbed down.

I should learn not to read reviews before something is out.

The flaws of the movie, from the historical point-of-view are still there.  Any movie I've seen have the same type of problems.  It would be difficult to show even a year of Alexander's reign in three hours much less an overview of his life (and this is what the movie is...an overview from Oliver Stone's perspective).

That much said, if this would have been the cut released to the theaters, the movie probably would not have been a flop in the US.  It is much more linear (still some flashbacks).  Colin's whining doesn't seem to be so dramatic in this cut, and Jolie's accent seems not so extreme.  The narration of Ptolomy also seems to make a bit more sense.

To be honest, if this cut would have been the theatrical release, the movie probably would have won the Oscar for Best Picture.

For the detractors, watch this version.  For those who enjoyed the original version, you'll enjoy this one, too.  For those who haven't seen the movie, watch this version and then watch the original version.

Highest rating for a movie that I can give.",1123459200,4,1304,4.564655172413793
2310576,5,B0009PLLN6,"I loved Alexander, but then I'm a classical Greek and Roman history nut. Three years ago, I decided to work my way through history from the Bronze Age to the present. I haven't been able to get past the Greeks and Romans. Every time I read something like Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides or Xenophon, I'm lead somewhere else that's equally worthy of my time.

Without question, Alexander the Great is one of the most fascinating figures in history. The only one I can think of to rival him is Julius Caesar, who, ironically, shared both his voracious appetite for power and his sexual ambiguity. I found Stone's biopic to be very true to the Alexander I read about in history. He was a man capable of both great compassion and great rage. He very much wore his heart on his sleeve, which is why he could murder a close friend over an insult and then wail with grief after the friend died. In many ways, Alexander was too big for this world. How could one country, one lover or one sexual orientation satisfy him?

I think mainstream movie goers weren't ready for Alexander. When they go to a sandal and sword epic, they want to see Mel Gibson, Russell Crow or Tom Cruise wade into a nice ordered battle with his sword swinging. They want to see the opposing army die easily and not leave a scratch, like they are supposed to. Then they want to see their hero come back home to the waiting arms of his female partner where they can have passionate but civilized sex. I'm afraid that's not the way it was. Battles were, and are, chaotic messes where the dust, noise and action made it difficult to tell what's going on. Bisexuality was commonplace in Ancient Greece, in fact it was state-sanctioned in Sparta. It makes me laugh when people criticize films for being too formulaic. Then a film like this comes along and everybody complains that it lacks cohesion. In other words, it doesn't follow the formula. The film seems disjointed and complicated because Alexander's life was disjointed and complicated.

Stone is clearly a fellow student of history and has a particular affinity for Alexander. This comes across in the wondrous battle sequences. Stone brought the Battle of Gaugamela to life and did it right! The infantry is in phalanx  formation, the dust is flying and one flank of the army has absolutely no idea what the other flank is doing. This is exactly the way it happened.

If I have any criticism for this film it is that Stone didn't give the whole story. Clearly, if the film is to have any value in the future then it will be among people like me who share his passion for history. I think he might have been better served to do a miniseries for cable where he could have taken his time and shown the razing of Thebes and some of the other important events that happened in Alexander's life. He probably wouldn't have gotten the budget he did but I don't think he needed all of the A-list stars he had. This story is good enough to tell itself.",1123459200,11,2960,4.525233644859813
2310577,3,B0009PLLN6,"Braveheart, Gladiator, Last Samurai, Troy ...I think the Rock did something but who cared?

Oliver Stone must have meant for this movie to be more of an educational history lesson than entertainment.  The scenes go back and forth in time 40 years, 10 years, 9 years... once or twice is enough!!  Your attention span is only 8 seconds, how could they think that is NOT annoying!?

The homosexuality turned my stomach but it was part of the history and at least the had the courtesy of not putting Alexander in bed with his ""bbuddy"" like they did with his wife. Hopefully Colin wouldn't want that on his resume in bold.
""2005 Alexander - exceptional performance; in bed with naked man scene""

You almost wanted to give this movie 2 stars but you have to give them credit for scenery and the acting of some of the other stars.  Angelina Jolie grabbed her role by the horns in this movie. Excellent acting and she fit right in.  The elephants in battlefield woods of India was some unique footage you just don't see.  It was wise not to have too many battles out in the field scenes.  They're important to the story but unless it's a main character fighting, it slows the story down and becomes just a time-filler.

So this tall bearded warrior with a thick Scottish accent comes out of the crowd, one of Alexander's soliders,  to speak his mind during one of Alexander's speeches.  ...uhh ok, did one of Mel Gibson's soldiers get lost and decide to go hang out in Asia for the belly dances?  ...or are they just trying to cheat some
Celtic appeal into the movie cause they know it works.  Now where'd they get THAT idea?

Ever since Braveheart all the movie actors in their prime want to get a piece of the ancient battlefield action.  Let's hope the next movie like this does better.",1123372800,3,1781,4.51875
2310578,1,B0009PLLN6,"Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's ALEXANDER, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time.  The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.

The emphasis, however, should be on the word ""attempt.""  ALEXANDER fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.

Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point.  He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirty-and above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age.  Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead you to believe he is in desperate need of a dose of salts.  It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.

Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible.  Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip.  Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage.  As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father.  The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.

During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual.  Unfortunately for those who come unhinged over such matters, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas.  That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like.  But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to ""indicate"" the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen.  The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.

For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degree-largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.

The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narration-something that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen.  But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.

In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation.  At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film.  Approximately two hours later the film presents this ""lost time"" in the form of a flashback-but by this point the purpose of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway.  Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel storylines and time lines.  One need look no further than JFK to see his skill.  It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.

When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world.  Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris.  It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.

As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality.  Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.

2310579,1,B0009PLLN6,"After watching this long boring film, I could not help thinking just why Oliver Stone made this film in this aful fashion.  Whenever exciting parts came up in the film, it only lasted for very short time, and all the boring parts in this movie lasted a whole lot longer.  Some parts of the movie was shown for very long time, and other parts were just shown very quickly.  This film needed to be evened out.  For example, Alexander's first whife dance scene was shown for quite a long time.  Then, I had to set through lot of the boring mumble jumble after that.  Then, the movie showed male dancers dancing, and I thought finally something exotic and fun thing to watch, but then this portion of the film only lasted for 5 seconds!  In the commentary section, Oliver Stone said that he did not wished to spend too much time showing this male dancing portion of the film, because he felt it was not about the dancing at all.  I could not believe that Oliver Stone said this.  This portion was one of the more exciting parts of the movie to watch, and if he would have made this portion longer, we might have seen some wonderful and exotic dance moves.  After watching this whole film, I could not help but felt disappointed, and not just because I felt I got short changed on the dance section, but short changed on all the exciting parts int this whole movie.

2310580,5,B0009PLLN6,"The director's cut of Alexander is far and away a better movie than the theatrical release.  Moving the first battle sequence (Gaugamela) up sooner in the narrative and dispersing the ""court intrigue"" more evenly throughout the rest of the film gives it more visceral impact and a better pace.  My only quibbles with the film are several omissions:

1.  The film doesn't spend any time on what made Alexander ""Great"" and why he's still studied today:  his genius for strategy and tactics in military operations.

2.  Some of his judgment blunders (ex. burning the palace at Persepolis during a drunken orgy) that sowed mistrust among his army, the conquered Persians and back in Macedon.

3.  Some references to his mythology (ex. cutting the Gordian knot) would have given more resonate to the god-like reverence he received from his army and people.

Like I said, quibbles that probably would have made the movie five hours long instead of nearly three.  Enjoy!",1123372800,4,963,4.95625
2310581,2,B0009PLLN6,"I was going to see this film in the theater. But When the critics and people that I know were unhappy with this film. I stayed away from it.

I now have seen the ""Special Edition Cut"". All I can say is that despite its gorgous production value, this film lacked a good screen play. The battle scenes were not that well executed in terms of music and sound, somtimes the music plays to loudly in these sequences that it took away the horror. I do not hold a Grudge against Vangelis he is a good composer but he should have let the battle sequence play themselves out (Think John Williams in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. He let those battle sequences play themselves out) and one more thing the second battle sequence (at Jhelum in present day Pakistan) was historically inaccurate (I know this is Hollywood but still) Alexander was not wounded there He was wounded at Multan (also in present day Pakistan)and Alexander's horse died of illness not in battle.

Acting wise Colin Ferrell's Alexander acts much more like a child then a young King. I don't blame Ferrell he is a good actor I blame the writers If that was the REAL Alexander Then God help us.

Jolie's Olympias acting wise is a bit spotty. Sometimes she good somtimes she acts like a vampire

Kilmer's Philips is more of a drunk than a king.

To make things worse for those who did not studied Alexander's history before watching this film are going to be very lost... and that is a pity.

I do appreciate Oliver Stone's effort He did make some great though controversial films. But this was just poorly executed.

2310582,2,B0009PLLN6,"Sorry but I was very disappointed in this film! The Story of Alexander is a great one and a good moral lesson to boot. The man went out and basically took over a huge chunk of the known old world. He was one hell of a soldier and General. But He also wound up as a monster and a tryant who had lost his soul in the loneliness and madness of being an absolute monarch. Who was probadly was poisoned by his nobles in Bagdad as they were terrified of him.
  Also his conquest helped fianance the Hellenistic Age which established Greek Culture as one of the Pillars of Western Civilisation. That would of been nice to mention in the film. Or the establishment of that lovely city in Egypt with the nice library.
  But instead we get this dogs breakfast with some very good special effects. That basically said that he was Gay and incidentally kicked The Persian Empires butt. I have no problem with the established historical fact that he was either gay or bisexual or whatever. But there is a whole lot more to the story than just this.
  Like why did he do this all this fighting? (Avenge the Persian Invasion of Greece  a century before) Why did they drink like fish back then? (All soldiers drink to a greater or lessor degree)Why did Alexander kill his oldest ,best General and his family? (Because of raging insecurity after his pages tried to kill him) Why did the Army refuse to go into India? (It would of been nice to have one of the enlisted tell us why. Like ""I wanna go home & I want to spend my loot!"")

This newest version of the life of Alexander The Great starring Colin Farrell was a big disappointment to me at the theatre. I would rather had watched Alexander's conquest of the Mediterranean rather than watch him cry over what appears to be his lover in this movie, and the lover crying over him. Even if Alexander was a homosexual, which was probably an accepted way of life for the greeks at that time, the movie didn't have to focus on that so much. I like battle scenes in movies like this.

Just plain god-awful. Why was this made? Why do all of the Greek and Macedonian men of 200-300BC have Irish accents. Why does Angelina Jolie speak with a Russian accent?

These and many other questions spring to mind when watching the film. It could be mistaken for a Colin Farrell ""vehicle film"" ala Vin Diesel in ..Riddick, but since the film actually makes him look like a complete idiot this couldn't possibly be the case. Woeful acting abounds throughout the movie on top of all this, along with some purely ridiculous homosexual tendencies from Alexander, not ridiculous in context mind you, ridiculous in execution.

As you may have guessed i hated this movie, i only finished it out of principle - to rise above it all...just like Alexander, to become a god among men. whatever....",1123286400,3,917,4.791139240506329

To call this movie the ""Battlefield Earth"" of historical epics would be an insult to ""Battlefield Earth"", because THAT movie was at least entertaining in its awfulness.

So, what's wrong with Alexander?  Gee, where do I begin?  How about the non-linear story line which in no way hightens the drama, and only serves to confuse the viewer.  How about the battle scenes?  There are two major ones.  The first one is so confusing that I had no idea that Alexander's army had won until Anthony Hopkins' narraration told me they did.  The second battle was in India and involved elephants.  While watching this sequence, I couldn't help but be reminded of ""Return of the King"", and I wished I was watching that movie instead.

Did Oliver Stone really make this travesty?  This is the same guy who directed ""Platoon"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July""?  I can't believe it.  I watched the director's cut.  If this is the ""new and improved version"", I can only imagine how bad the theatrical version must be.  Thankfully, I'll never know.

Be warned.  This movie clocks in at nearly 3 hours.  Not only is it bad, but it never seems to end.  Its confusing, dull, tedious, and boring; a complete waste of your time.

2310588,1,B0009PLLN6,"At a cost of over $ 150,000,000 to make, and overtaken at the box office by the ""SpongeBob"" movie, ""Alexander"" is the 21st century ""Heaven's Gate."" The participants in this epic disaster should hope that few people see this film, because like ""Heaven's Gate"" in 1981, this could be a career-breaker. Oliver Stone's direction, working with a weak and often preposterous script, is a major catastrophe. The only scene that works in the entire 3 hours of this film is when the young Alexander (Connor Paolo, the only cast member whose reputation as an actor remains untarnished) tames the wild horse Bucephalus.

As Alexander, Colin Farrell is hopeless. Instead of having a commanding presence, as one would assume Alexander had to have, he is feeble and gives us a ""smaller than life"" hero, a puppy dog in need of his lover Haphastion (Jared Leno in heavy eye makeup). He also not only has a thick Irish accent, but very poor diction. An actor getting major roles should be skilled enough to remove regional traces from his speaking voice, and be able to acquire a ""non-accent.""

Another vocal treasure is Angelina Jolie, who pouts and plays with her pet snake collection, and sounds exactly like Lotte Lenya in ""From Russia with Love."" If this film makes a dent in the Hollywood history books, it will be for this bizarre characterization of Olympias. What was Jolie thinking, and why did Stone allow it?

The quasi-historical epic of heroism and adventure is my favorite genre, and I wanted to enjoy this film, but was almost repulsed by it. If you want to see a towering failure, this is it. Filmed in Morocco, there are miles of rusty colored desert, and the landscape was much better served in the made for TV Bible films. The soundtrack by Vangelis is also unsuccessful, and in many scenes seems to be out-of-synch with the action on the screen.

2310589,1,B0009PLLN6,"I went to four different video rental stores to find the special edition DVD, and ended up renting the director's cut because non of them carried the special edition. After viewing this film, I would like to take time and express following thoughts.

1.  The director's cut DVD cover says this version will move faster and it's lot better then the regular version.  I have heard that whole eight minutes of the movie was cut in this version, so why put out the director's cut version at all?  I guess you will save a whole lot of time by not having to take out one disc and put in a second disk.  Yeah, it definately saved me a lot of time.  Oliver Stone should have left the sinking ship alone, and not make it worse by putting out the director's cut version.  I have friends who saw the regular version at the theater, and now I have no idea what parts they were talking about in certain areas, because those were cut from the director's cut version.  I would liked to just watch the regular version.

2.  I liked the cast that was selected for the movie.  Yes, it had flaws when it came to getting the accent correctly, but I thought the casts did best as they could for what the've got.  I liked Alexander's blond hair, but I wished it was more natural looking, and the casts make up could have been better.  The females looked very attratctive in the film, so I wondered why they did not make Alexander's male lovers equally as attractive.  They also could have worn more attractive customes, especially when shown Idian customes.

3.  I am not a gay person, so don't think I am writting this part because I'm some angry gay person who did not get to see a lot of nude scenes in this film.  This is thy film that lot of people (straight and gay alike) waited to come out for a very long time.  Although, I gave Oliver Stone a lot of respect for making this kind of film, but what people wanted was for him to be whole lot more bold (no, not like making this film a porn style), and put scenes in the film that were both exciting and make people feel little nutty to watch.  This could have been thy film that really push the boundries.  This could have been thy film that really have made the people think about a whole new territories that they could explore when making films.  Instead, I felt like Oliver Stones only threaded on the water, and didn't leap in it.  He was so careful to not to affend people who may not feel comfortable watching male love scenes, so he water downed and made it very boring to watch.  This movie was so watered down, I felt like I was watching some long documentary film on Alexander.  Also, I understand if the movie needed to containe some narration, but it went on through the whole film!  I became frustrated half way through the movie with all these narration after narration.  The movie would not have needed this much narration if what Anthony Hopkins spoke about during the movie was actually shown in the movie rather them having him talk about it.  I have heard that the movie sensors have told Oliver to cut some scenes from the movie before it was released to the public.  That was a big mistake in my book, because now this film looks like the editing room mess.

4.  I am an optimistic person.  I am hoping that someone will make this movie again with maybe even with the same people in this movie, and this time really push the limits and not tone it down because that just makes it very boring to watch.  With all the terrible movie that has been out this year, I for one had lot of hopes when I heard that Alexander was coming out.  What a huge disappoinatment.  I would not watch this film again, unless Oliver puts out a different version of this film with all the scenes that sensors had him take out.",1123286400,7,3760,4.324285714285714
2310590,1,B0009PLLN6,"Ever since Showgirls stumbled into movie theaters a decade or so ago. People been waiting impatiently to see if this theatrical low point could be or would be ever surpassed. Well the wait is over...Alexander is such a film. Many thought it couldn't be done but Oliver Stone has surpassed even Paul Verhoven for delivering the most bombastic, over the top, misguide, boring, campy, piece of celluloid since Plan 9 from Outer Space. What's even more amazing is that Mr Stone had $124,990,000 more than those two movie combine to achieve this. For all it's faults Showgirls was set in Vegas and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas where Alexander ravages three continents shamelessly.
Where Showgirls always had a tongue and cheek quality (hopefully that was Verhoeven intention) Alexander goes out it's way to be taken seriously (that IS Stone's intention). The more the movie attempts to be serious the more it hits new lows.

Colin Farrell's Alexander is a wonderful portrayal of a sexually confused California surfer with an Irish accent, (who is actually suppose to be  playing a Greek)  as  Keanu Reeves is to a FBI agent in Point Break. Angelina Jolie's ravishing looks cannot overcome her dreadful role as the Hellenic Mommy Dearest with an awful Transylvanian accent.  Val Kilmer gives us a rare insight on how Greece would be ruled by an older and more plumped Jim Morison rekindling his Irish roots. Anthony Hopkins, the winner of the ""most didn't want to be in this movie award"" stammers around looking bewildered and bored.  Jared Leto plays male model well but never gets a chance to strut his stuff due to the endless Alexander monologues. Rosario Dawson had only one reason to be in this film, should I say two (and you get to them).

One can spend hours if not days reviewing the many low lights of this film (which is only three hours in comparison) It's hard to get around a movie set in Greece where most the actors are speaking with an Irish brogue. The movie calls out for action and adventure only to be muddled with endless monologues,exposition.and winking (yes winking)  A story that cries out for a heroic lead, ends up with a weak,confused, uninteresting, wining, mens room attendant (sorry for insulting man's room attendants) Where's the greatness, the valor, it's not in this movie. Only the pain, the boredom, and the nagging headache. You have a strong constitution if you can stay awake through an entire screening. (best seen in pieces, if seen at all) Like Showgirls before it , it marks new lows in Hollywood's film history and leaves behind similar after affects. PS someone should actually watch the whole movie before it's released. Then maybe they won't release it and save us all from all the nasty hangover.",1123286400,7,2749,4.834042553191489
2310591,3,B0009PLLN6,"I did not see this in the theatres.  All the negative reviews and my lack of interest in Jolie or Farrell kept me from bothering.  I'd heard that the homosexuality was practically non-existent (which was a fact of his life) and that there was a major Oedipus thing going on with his mother.  The DVD Director's Cut does not shy away from the homosexuality and I didn't find an Oedipus complex lurking in the corners.

Where ""Troy"" completely changed mythology to make it more palatable to the general homophobic masses ""Alexander"" embraced it and didn't flich on anything.  The relationship Alexander had with Hephaistion was about love, not sex.  This was shown in the many cuts of looks, gestures and words said between the characters.  The fact that everyone accepted it during that time period, well that's something maybe we should think about in this day and age.  Alexander's relationship with his mother came across more as her constant need to control and manipulate.  For lack of a better label for her I would say she was a social climber with sharp teeth.

My favorite character and the person who I thought was the best in the film is Val Kilmer.  I loved his character and I loved him in it.  This is the best role I've seen Val in in ages.  He's been stuck in direct to DVD and cable TV movie land for far too long.  Hopefully some other director will see this film and go ""oh yeah Val Kilmer, he's great I think I'll cast him.""

Angelina Jolie, I'm not so much a fan of, I can take her or leave her.  In this role though she played a manipulative witch quite well.  I kept waiting for someone to kill her and hoping we'd get to see it.

Colin Farrell seems to be at his best when he plays characters who don't look like they can do much but end up changing the lives of the people around them.  Some of the moments in the film reminded me of his character in ""Home at the End of the World"". I saw naked bits of him in this movie and one bit I could've lived without seeing, you just don't need to see the swing you know.

Jared Leto plays a nice loyal pretty boy quite well.  He's much prettier on screen than he is in everyday life.  I felt bad for his character when Alexander got married to a girl and not him. Though he understood the need for Alexander to have an heir so didn't act as if it was a betrayal of their love.

Again, loved Val Kilmer.  He really rocked the screen.  He completely owned every scene he was in and playing a great general, well he should own the scenes.

This was about a million times better than ""Troy"".  ""Troy"" sucked on so many levels where this film does not.  Both had pretty boys mostly naked, sweaty, muscular and dirty but ""Alexander"" actually made sense and was historically accurate.  Watching ""Troy"" in the theatre I tried desperately not to bust out laughing during parts of it and ended up laughing during the credits.

Yes there are flaws in ""Alexander"".  It's long,but duh it's an epic.  Some of the CGI was cheesey and obvious.  During some of the battle scenes I almost looked for elves and hobbits.  The jumping back and forth in time thing was annoying and pointless, he should've just either made it linear or had less flashbacks.  Also this is nitpicky and an odd criticism but he opened on a scene with an iris out shot and I just thought it was weak it's one of the oldest editing shots in the book and there was no point to it.  The iris deterred from the shot to me rather than enhanced it.

Finally did I mention it was about a thousand times better than ""Troy""?  Hello Brad Pitt I just wanted to let you know that character was supposed to be your lover not your cousin/nephew.

So unlike ""Troy"" which I'd only watch again if there was a bet or drinking game attached to it, I would watch ""Alexander"" again, no bet or drinking game needed.",1123200000,6,3815,4.357446808510638

2310593,5,B0009PLLN6,"In viewing ""Alexander: The Director's Cut"" it is wise to follow the advice of historian Arthur Weigall in his prolog to the story of another dreamer, Cleopatra. ""We must not commit the anachronism of criticizing our surroundings from the standard of twenty centuries after Christ."" There for when you enter this world of twenty three centuries ago the morals of our time do not fit and must be left at the door.

  A challenging and visionary film by Oliver Stone, Alexander is a wonder to behold. This story of histories most enigmatic and controversial man is told in a non linear form with stunning visuals and great performances by it's well chosen cast.

  Here in Stone's re-edited Directors Cut the director has rearranged the film to succeed where if failed for some critics in its first run in the theater. For me the first version was wonderful but now it is more accessible to the mass audience.
  It was brave of Oliver Stone to approach the accents as different dialects of English since the Greeks of that time undoubtedly spoke in different accents depending upon where they came from. It is refreshing not to have everyone speaking in high tones of epic movie English.

  As Alexander Colin Farrell shows his great range as a young actor and incredible grasp of the complexities of a man who dreamed of a one world blended of many cultures and ideas. His conflicted relationships with his charismatic parents are played in counterpoint to his desire for conquest in the name of peace. Colin Farrell ascends heights of emotion of both the man and the pan sexual aspects of Alexander. Some viewers squirm at the relationship of Alexander and Hephaistion others say it was not explicit enough. Both these views of this one aspect of Alexander speak volumes about the viewer rather than what is on the screen. When I listened to Stone's commentary he makes it clear that it is not about sex but about love. And there in lies the difference between our world and the world of Alexander.

  Standing like a lioness is Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother, Olympias. She embodies all the savage and regal qualities of a Queen who must fight for her son's rights and at times even his life to perfection. She is thrilling to watch in her bravura performance.  I do not find her youth a hindrance at all, being that Olympias came to the throne at a young age and most likely bore Alexander in her mid teens.

  As Phillip, Val Kilmer is simply wonderful. Rough, savage and tragic, he gives a memorable performance that stands with his best.

  Rosario Dawson is a perfect Roxanne, exotic, regal and sensuous. She brings to her role an understanding of a woman that very little is known about.

  As Hephaistion, Jared Leto is perfect in his support and love of his boyhood friend. He embodies the beauty, wisdom and patience of Alexander's dearest friend.

  ""Alexander"" from its incredible opening credits that show the multicultural influences of the world of Persia and Greece to its set pieces of Babylon, Alexandria Egypt, and the two great battles that are shown is a stunning visual feast that takes the viewer into a world that we can only imagine in our dreams.  The production design by Jan Roelfs and the contributions by the art department and costume designer, Jenny Beavan are simply Herculean and gorgeous.

  The score by Vangellis is heartbreakingly beautiful and soars to the heights of true epic proportions just as it needed to.

  The extra's on this two disk DVD include an indepth documentary of the making of the film. It also includes an excelent and informitive comentary by Oliver Stone.

  ""Alexander"" has been greatly misunderstood as a film, just as the man has been misunderstood by many. If you possess the brave open heart of a dreamer, then go with Stone's vision of a lost world and time and share in the dream of Alexander.",1123200000,9,3866,4.7507507507507505

If you love motivational speeches there are about ten in this film. If you love pointless attempts at being contraversial. Then this may be the movie for you. But probably not. Please don't fall for the 'Directors Cut' ploy by the studio. A director who has fallen as far as Oliver Stone cant be trusted. And I doubt Spielberg could help this one. Maybe someday we can get a laugh track version of this film. That may get a little action from the discount isle. But again I have to say probably not.",1123200000,8,806,4.240259740259741
2310597,3,B0009PLLN6,"This Director's Cut DVD rates its three stars because Oliver Stone is incapable of being non-controversial, it's an epic view of an epic life, it's a full nine minutes shorter than the original (truly), and because so many wrong-headed reviews have appeared here and elsewhere that it qualifies as victim or  underdog, either of which earns some sympathy. Otherwise, ""Alexander"" might be starless, not for its askewed history or card-shuffle editing but for the wasted opportunity it represents.

Baz Lurhman, the Austrailan director, is planning his own take on Alexander with Leonardo DiCaprio. It can only be better. Last year's ""Troy,"" for that matter, was better, even though it turned the legendary anger of Achilles into petulance and his male lover into a cousin (Stone gets credit for not dodging that issue.)

Colin Farrell as Alexander and Angelina Jolie as his scheming mother are pretty but clearly miscast. Val Kilmer fares better as his rabid father but the script undermines him, as it does everyone. Robin Lane Fox, the definitive biographer of Alexander, was a consultant, but Stone must have stoned him. Two combat sequences, one featuring an eagle's overview and the other costumed elephants, are edited so ineptly it's hard to know what's happening, which doesn't much matter because Alexander never lost a battle. Anthony Hopkins' on and off-screen narration throughout helps somewhat.

For this two-disc DVD, Stone says he cut some of the ""gayness"" over which critics and homophobes have chortled. In fact, in his original there was nothing overt, just the suggestion that Alexander was bisexual, as was customary at the time. Even that little was too much for some; others complained it wasn't enough. Unless you show naked people fornicating, filmmakers are accused of avoiding human sexuality. Cameras used to pan away and scenes dissolve after the first kiss. Not any more; today the actors are just getting started.

Subtlety is usually a stranger to Stone, but the very idiosyncracies that favor this director go against him here. Farrell and his pals have lilting Irish accents, Jolie utters (there's no other word for her speech) an ersatz Balkan, Kilmer barks Americanese, and everyone else speaks brittle British. When Alexander enters Babylon, you half expect to encounter the Tower of Babel.

What could this bold and, yes, exciting director have been thinking to tackle a subject of such complexity and magnitude? Ancient history is far from the contemporary terrain he walks so well (""Wall Street,"" ""JFK,"" the Vietnam trilogy). Stone is never going to conquer his known world if he spears another spectacular dud like this one.",1123113600,6,2664,5.183720930232558
2310598,1,B0009PLLN6,"One but has to read Peter Green's epic biography ""Alexander of Macedon"" to realize that his was a story meant to be told on film.  Alas, Green's book is far more interesting than Oliver Stone's long and tedious ""Alexander"".  Colin Farrell is badly miscast as the Macedonian conqueror; he spends the entire film crying, whining and generally overacting to the point that this viewer actually dreaded his next scene.

In point of fact, just about everyone is miscast in ""Alexander"", particularly Angelina Jolie, who is obviously too young to be the central character's mother.  The one saving grace is Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, Philip.  Kilmer gives life to Philip's drunken antics; it is known that the Macedonians were very fond of drinking to excess-Alexander himself killed one of his top commanders, Cleitus, in another alcohol-fueled confrontation (shown all too graphically in the film).

Much of the chronology in the film is accurate (though Stone's flashbacks will confuse those with limited knowledge of Alexander's life).  Two major battles of Alexander's Asian campaign are portrayed:  Gaugamela (thought to be near Mosul in modern day Iraq), and The Hydaspes in what is now Pakistan.  Unfortunately neither the place nor the opposing commander (the Indian King Porus) in the latter battle are even mentioned in the film.  I felt the Granicus River, the place where Alexander first met the Persian King Darius III in battle after crossing into Asia, would have made a better subject than the gigantic Gaugamela.  Alexander was badly wounded there, but recovered.  Granicus was a nearly evenly matched affair, which could have gone either way.

More than 2,300 years after his death, Alexander's exploits have become legend. Many episodes in Alexander's life are well known in our day: the first encounter with his famed horse Bucephalus (perhaps the first equine in recorded history to be known by name), to the aforementioned murder of Cleitus, to his deathbed, where he refused to name a successor among his commanders.  Somehow the film deflates these occurrences; by trying to make Alexander almost godlike, Stone undercuts the import of them.

Even though the timeline is largely right, the film simply does not have ""life""; it is told in an almost comatose fashion.  Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" had similar elements, yet was never boring-even the calmer periods of the film were well-acted and held the viewer's interest.  ""Alexander"" plods along to the next battle, personal confrontation or intrigue without much fanfare.

Alexander the Great is acknowledged by just about anyone with a brain as the greatest military commander of all time-he never lost a battle in his short 32 years of life-but this film falls far short of doing his legacy justice.  The biggest flaw in the film is casting Colin Farrell in a role that is clearly beyond his abilities.  One star.",1123113600,10,2891,5.136752136752137
2310599,2,B0009PLLN6,"While I'm not joining the ranks of those who are jumping on Oliver Stone's ass as a has-been, ""Alexander"" is not a very good argument to the contrary.  The last really good movie I saw from Stone was probably ""U-Turn"", a great little sleeper if there ever was one.  ""Any Given Sunday"" had it's moments but tried way too hard to live up to the lifestyle insanity perpetrated by lesser gridiron flicks like ""The Program"" and ""Varsity Blues"".  ""Alexander"" is as tragically flawed as it's title character, a horrendous series of missteps that overlap so often that, for reviewing purposes, it's difficult to keep track of them all.

I hate to be a Colin-basher, but like many I also didn't feel Farrell was convincing as the greatest conqueror the world had ever seen.  Sure, he pulled off impetuous, daring, and (dare I say it?) even gay with aplomb, but I believe the problem lies in the script.  Even Anthony Hopkins came off as a little hokey, but given the dialogue what can you expect?  Perhaps the worst was Angelina Jolie, a vaguely incestuous background presence for Alexander throughout the movie.  I really can't emphasize how badly the dialogue helped to tank the movie.  It veers wildly from hackneyed ""Ye gods why hast thou forsaken me?"" platitudes to sheerly incomprehensible wannabe Homeric/Shakespearean ranting.  You can certainly tell what it is that they're trying to get across but you can't make yourself believe that even a people in a completely different world than ours would talk to each other in this manner.  However, the dialogue is only part of the problem, and I think if we compare ""Alexander"" to Stone's other historical dramas we can get a little closer to the root of the problem.

Regardless of the amount of conjecture involved in bringing the stories of both JFK and Richard Nixon to the screen, both of those movies worked for a reason:  an unflagging attention to detail.  The reason most Hollywood biopics feel formulaic (even the beloved ""Ray"" is largely guilty of this) is because the life of a man is complex and not always rational; some of the more jagged edges are often sanded down to make it less confusing for the average viewer.  However, in doing so you run the risk of making your movie seem less like watching someone's life play out on the screen and more like a typical Hollywood melodrama.  If ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" are guilty of all manner of sins under the sun they are certainly not guilty of being ""Hollywood"".  These films worked because Oliver Stone took his time to really get inside the heads of these men and tell their tales, regardless of how many scenes or how much screen time it took to do so.

But there's one big difference between those films and ""Alexander"": budget.  Yet the reason such an extravagant budget is required for this film but not the others is that neither JFK nor Nixon required huge action set pieces to tell their story.  For Alexander there is no other way.  From the age when most of us are having our first (legal) beer, Al was on the battlefield, carving his empire into the history books.  We also have another problem here:  the passage of time.  JFK and Nixon were both products of the 60s, and there is a wealth of detailed writing available on the intimacies of their psyches.  With Alexander we still have a great deal of chronicling of his exploits, but what we have mostly pertains to his military and political exploits, which leaves the mind of the man open to interpretation (ie. we know that up until the time of Philip's death Alexander was tutored by Aristotle - as famed a philosopher as ever Alexander would be a conqueror - but as to the substance of those teachings history is at a complete loss).  So it's just possible that Oliver Stone's strengths lay in other areas than psychoanalysis.  You can certainly tell a story without having any real insight into the human mind - pick up any mass market paperback for proof of that - and you can also film a pretty spiffy movie without being able to tell a story.  My guess is we're finding out that Stone's strengths reside somewhere between those two extremes, and if so, it's the choice of subject matter, scripts, etc. which will make or break his movies.  In the meantime let's not be too quick to make or break his legacy based on one or two misfires.",1123113600,2,4311,4.642951251646904
2310600,1,B0009PLLN6,"The first time i heard about Alexander the Great was through my world history teacher, who has such a passionate and personal affinity with him and what he did and stands for. I borrowed a book about Alexander and was very interested in the life of this extraordinary and legendary human being. Whether people agree or not, Alexander has changed the world in more ways than we can imagine, probably in more ways than any man that has changed the course of history (for his time). However, this movie doesn't show that. I first saw Alexander at the movie theatre, and most likely i will never borrow it or rent it even if somebody gave it to me for free! Here are the things that i found wrong with this movie:

1) Collin Farrel. Let's face it, just because he bleached his hair blonde and wears Roman armor doesn't mean that he makes a good Alexander. For one, the main problem is that he's not CONVINCING enough. How in the world are we supposed to believe that this man was a strong and powerful leader while for the most part in this movie we see him crying and hugging up on his soldiers? How are we supposed to believe that his soldiers will DIE for Alexander during battle when we aren't even convinced that he's actually a great leader? Do we actually care about Alexander during the battle itself? Collin as Alexander was just so bland and uninspiring, i thought the boy who played the young Alexander did much better acting.

2) The chronology of events: Okay, let's be a bit more realistic here, apparently Oliver Stone didn't intend to be very precise or historically accurate. But if you are going to make a movie about an actual person and actual events that not everybody is going to know about, i think it's best to be sure that the events correlate with one another and are clear and concise. It seemed kind of random that in the middle of the film they make a flashback of when Alexander's father died. Why couldn't they have done that in the beginning when it actually happened? I just felt as if in the last minute Oliver Stone thought ""oh wait, I forgot to add this scene..."" and just randomly put it in the film regardless of how confusing and awkward it would be for the audience.

3) The ""homosexuality"" issue: For one, yes, Alexander was gay. However, it just seemed pretty silly and ridiculous that in this movie ""homosexuality"" seems to be defined or represented by how much a man hugs another man. Not that i was expecting there to be sex scenes from Queer as Folk in ancient times, but c'mon, why not portray the man's homosexuality in more ways than him just hugging and crying over a man?

4) Messy action scenes: Okay, yes, none of us can even imagine how bloody war was back then in the ancient world. But extremely rough and bloody doesn't have to equate to messy and ridiculous fighting scenes. The battle scenes were just way too over the top and cluttered to be exciting let alone interesting. And in some scenes i thought it was either too cheesy, or just way too long and boring. It didn't leave you cheering on for Alexander or for his men, it just makes you wish that everybody would die already so we can move on.

5) The acting: HORRIBLE. I think the only great cast from this movie was Angelina Jolie. Sure, her accent was kind of strange and not very good, but that woman is sexy as hell, regardless she pulled off her role very well.

6) The dialogue: Very bland and uninspiring.

7) Too Much Detail: First of all, not too many people can explain the life of Alexander in one book let alone in one movie. I think one of the flaws of this movie that it tries to cram in too much history too quickly, where it comes to the point where we just don't really care about the main character. And i think that's what this movie SHOULD have done, but doesn't really do that.

So all in all, this whole movie was just a big mess. The timing was bad, the acting is bad, and the whole film itself is just very inconsistent and so uninspiring. I don't understand why this movie is rated R other than the reason that we see Rasio Darson expose herself while threatening to cut Alexander's head off. And even that scene seemed unnecessary and pointless, just an attempt to give the movie an R rating. The biggest flaw of all i believe though is Collin Farrel for making Alexander very dull, uninspiring, and uninteresting, and also for Oliver Stone's lack of actually making us CONNECT with this legendary, immortal like character.",1123113600,8,4461,4.465030674846626
2310601,5,B0009PLLN6,"Try to be objective and look at the reviews of people trashing the movie and then look at the ones recommending it (e.g.  Suzanne Cross), and see which one sounds more logical. I think people trash this movie a lot because they were expecting a blockbuster instead of an art film. People who claim this movie is a disappointment are probably expecting a superficial cartoon-like epic such as Troy. This movie on the other hand does not have a simple story. It presents a new take on very likely events in the life of Alexander the great, conveying his dreams and ideas. The style of Oliver Stone is recognizable in the visions and flashbacks, something that might put down Troy fans, but that certainly adds character to the movie. The visuals of the movie are absolutely amazing. The Battle scenes with Darius are very well done and the battle in India conveys so much power. I would have liked to get a little bit more insight into the Persian Empire (Having read ""The Histories"" by Herodotus),  but to go into this other dimension in an already 3-hour long film would be asking for too much.  In summary I found this movie the best I have seen among the movies based on Ancient Greece or Rome (hopefully one day they will make movies during the Persian, Byzantine or Arab empires). A definitively must see for Oliver Stone fans and for history enthusiasts.",1123113600,5,1359,4.630705394190872
2310602,4,B0009PLLN6,"After all the controversy about the homosexuality in this film, I was expecting to see something bordering on soft-core porn. In fact the gay scenes are so tame that they hardly warrant mention, except as additions to the plots. I see more blatant and vulgar hetero sex on 15 minutes of daytime television than I see homo sex in the whole three hours of Alexander. And in fact, most of the homosexuality in the film focused not on sex, but on love. The Homo scenes consisted mostly of loving words and hugging, (fully clothed). Perhaps that is what got all the homophobes stirred up; not that a geat man in history could boink other men, but that he loved them. Would they have found those touching moments so horrible if there was a woman involved? It is ridiculous and disturbing that people got more upset about these tame and tasteful hints of qay love than they did of the rape of his first wife which contained more nudity, and sexual violence than did any other scene in the movie.

  Oliver Stone is the last director I would have expected to release a ""Directors Cut"" which eliminated most of the ""offensive"" homosexuality and ""boring"" political history in order to appease the bigots and lowbrows who can't handle seeing history presented somewhat accurately.(Let them go watch something mindless about boobs and explosions) I only hope it wasn't him that made that decision, but the same Hollywood machine which made Achilles' lover into his cousin in the butchering of history called ""Troy"".

None of the freshness and bold attitude of JFK or the striking brilliance of Platoon or the grittiness of Salvador are here. There's nothing memorable as Wall Street or as cutting as Talk Radio. After twenty minutes one asks them self ""where's Oliver"" He is not in this movie. The movie is lost and uneven. It starts and stops in fits. Colin Farrell is woefully miscast. He doesn't carry the movie, which he needs to do. He doesn't have the weight of character but he does give it the old college try (well you know what I mean). The choice of using Irish accents make it seem unbelievable. If one closes their eyes (which is not hard to do) one would think it is set in a pub in Dublin. For all the money that was spent on this film, it captured none of it's potential (especially compared to aspirations from the Behind the Scenes conversations). Through there was a lot of work put into the film, it doesn't all add up in the end. The only saving grace of the Director's Cut  edition is Oliver Stone's commentary (which is always a treat and is more interesting then the movie) and this cut is better than the theatrical version, if it's any consolation if you paid to see it in November, my condolences.",1123027200,3,1307,4.445833333333334
2310604,4,B0009PLLN6,"Myths often find their origin in the truth.  The truth, however, as it is remembered sometimes bends and changes between translations, fading memories, and subjective reasoning.  Thus, the truth gives birth to a myth while myths generate their own life in the mouth of storytellers and scholars whose wisdom and knowledge goes unquestioned.  Oliver Stone tells his vision of the greatest human myth of all time - the life of Alexander the Great.

Alexander depicts the tale of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great, from childhood until his death at the age of 32.  It should be known that contemporary studies on Alexander the Great often focus on his persona and what made him so great.  Unfortunately, no unbiased material exists in regards to Alexander's character, which has forced historians to deduct information through the recorded events and the limited amount of existing writing concerning Alexander.  It has left him with portrayals such as an evil tyrant to a kind and valiant leader.  The interpretation of Alexander's persona is open to examination, but true image of his character will never be known.  Nonetheless, scholars continue to hypothesize and make calculated guesses as to what made him so great.  Oliver Stone offers his interpretation in Alexander.

A fragmented storyline opens with Alexander raising his hand with a ring of some significance while laying on his deathbed.  An old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) reveals this is Alexandria 40 years after Alexander's death while reciting his past to a scribe.  It is a rather idealistic prologue that talks about Alexander's feats and achievements by setting sight on Babylon and the land beyond.  There are several visual insertions of mosaics and wall paintings to support Ptolemy's reasoning, which smoothly transition to Alexander's youth.

The disjointed storyline moves back and forth between Alexander's early days and his conquest of the east.  The flashbacks help understand how Alexander became who he turned out to be.  This of course is a subjective interpretation, as so many other interpretations that exist.  The cinematic version by Stone might be different than most desire.  Nonetheless, it is of no-less value than other interpretations.

Alexander in Stone's interpretation seems to have been heavily influenced by his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who constantly told him that he was a son of the god Zeus.  It is also apparent that Alexander's father, King Philip (Val Kilmer), influenced him, but much more infrequent than his mother.  There is also a heavy dose of how his education and friendships steered him in the direction of greatness.  These are facets that are essential in any human beings existence, and Alexander was not above it.  This helps paint a more real image than the mythical and mysterious persona that exists around Alexander the Great.

When Alexander (Collin Ferrell) stands outnumbered by one to six in front of the Persian army he begins his conquest of the east, as they know it.  This becomes the beginning of a life-long test where Alexander finds himself to have to utilize all his wisdom and knowledge.  The value of an education and sources of influence emerge in the film, as Alexander questions what has been taught when he steps beyond the known world.  It is also evident that the many mosaics and wall paintings in the film are relevant to the story, as Stone frequently returns to them as teachers would use learning tools in a classroom.  Slowly the audience gets to see how this historical person was shaped in Stone's interpretation.

It is an epic journey that Alexander undertakes and he is about to learn about group dynamics and the desires of others for wealth and power.  In a sense, the notions presented by Stone are very applicable in the modern world where xenophobia, homophobia, and expansionism exist.  This might seem a little too obvious of a contemporary societal critique, but the question remains for the audience to answer while viewing the film.

Some film critics have noted that war sequences are repetitively bloody, but then again is war not bloody and repetitive in the sense of killing?  In addition, the battle scenes create a sense of meaninglessness; as in retrospect humanity knows of the fabled glory of war created by kings and leaders to gain the masses approval and willingness to fight until the death.  Through these scenes, the audience does experience some of Alexander's greatness in regards to warfare, but also see the bloody aftermath.

The film, unfortunately, suffers from some larger-than-life acting, which maybe tries to develop a sense that the Greek gods might have been conversing.  Perhaps it is a result of the big Greek forums and the learning of how to speak in public, or it might be an attempt to create an atmosphere of greatness.  Whatever the reason, it feels awkward and it cannot be neglected, as the story tries to deal with more psychological and social issues.  Despite what could be called intentionally overacting, Stone succeeds in capturing a stunning environment for almost all scenes through a terrific cinematography, which elevates the cinematic experience.

Stone like so many other storytellers before him has told his version of the truth and sometimes bent the truth to keep the audience's attention, or to create a reaction.  In either case, it seems like Stone has added more to the myths around the historical person that also was the first to be named the Great.  It leaves the audience with a film that the viewer wants to like, but it does not really achieve the greatness it intended to.",1123027200,4,5621,5.058631921824104

2310606,3,B0009PLLN6,"I thought Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" went off the tracks when we suddenly cut from Alexander (Collin Farrell) as a young man butting heads with his father, King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), to Alexander as King about to fight the army of the Persian ruler Darius at the Battle of Issus.  I thought this was because since Alexander has the known world to conquerer in the 2 hours and 55 minutes of the director's cut that Stone was simply moving on to the good stuff.  But instead of simply doing a cinematic tour of the highlights of the life of Alexander the Great, Stone develops parallel stories.  In the ""present"" we have Alexander conquering the world while trying to juggle his relationships with Roxanne (Rosario Dawson), the woman he chooses to marry, and his particular friend Hephaistion (Jared Leto), while in the past Alexander has to grow up with a dominating mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and a disinterested father.  Actually, his mother insists he is the son of Zeus and not Philip, which explains why the king has picked a new queen and ignores Alexander.

Stone's purpose clearly seems to be that he wants to explore ""why"" Alexander did what he did.  The problem is that the film suggests it has something to do with his relationship with his parents, but how their treatment of him resulted in a young man audacious and brilliant enough to conquer the world is not clear.  The pivotal scene in the film becomes when Alexander insists that he can ride the great horse Bucephalus.  The young Alexander succeeds, just as the older one would conquer the world, but the reason for both remains what it was before the film started.  Alexander succeeds because he is Alexander the Great.  The movie is not advancing our understanding of the man the way that it should.  His parents seem to be teaching him valuable lessons only by negation and if Olympias insists Alexander is not the son of Philip, then Philip is even more blind than he usually is if he does not see that Alexander is not like his mother either.  The success of ""Alexander"" rests entirely on its ability to explain his motivation, and only in too brief scenes involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer), does it get close to the start of something that makes sense to me in that regard.

""How"" Alexander conquered the world is left mostly to the voice over narration of Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), now the Egyptian Pharaoh, with the exception of film's two battle sequences, the Battle of Issus and the Battle of the Hydaspes River in India.  These two battles represent his greatest victory and greatest, or at least final, defeat.  From a tactical standpoint the latter is the more interesting battle (especially all of the feints and psychological tactics Alexander employed before hand), but Stone only seeks to explain the former.  However, this is problematic because the battle was being fought on a desert plain devoid of physical detail, which makes it hard to appreciate what is going on the way we have in movies detailing battles like Waterloo or Gettysburg.  Of course, if the emphasis in the film is on ""why"" then the ""how"" becomes less important, which is why it is dealt with the way it is in this 2004 film.

The production design of the film handles the ""where"" and ""when"" of Alexander's life quite well, especially in the depiction of Babylon and some of the gorgeous costumes.  I have no problem with the casting, but I think all of the key principles tend to get too emotional too often, which also works against developing an acceptable ""why"" to Alexander's life.  We do get a sense of Alexander being ahead of his time in terms of how he treats those he has conquered (anticipation the Roman willingness to bring new peoples into their Empire), but by the time we get to the last acts of the film the quest of ""why"" he did what he did is complicated by trying to also cover why things fell apart, and we have as sketchy an idea of that in the end as we do the other.  There is a suggestion that Alexander overreached his bounds when he crossed into the Indian subcontinent and the film's most noteworthy cinematic moment creates his literal fall.  But then we are left with the simplistic notion that things fell apart because Alexander died, which means ""Alexander"" the film has not brought us any further understanding of the man than we had before we sat down to watch it.",1123027200,3,4390,4.696219035202086
2310607,1,B0009PLLN6,"I have read so many reviews from people who did not like this Alexander movie because of the homosexual scenes, I would like to stop and tell them to get over yourself!  How many of the same people who complained about this film because it contained some sexual scenes between two males, have complained about sex scenes between heterosexuals?  Some people even complained that there were scenes where Alexander and a male buddy gave eachother certain suggestive stares.  Well, how many movies that you have seen recently that contained the same things I stated above, but between heterosexuals?  How many nude scenes have you seen in films laterly which contained heterosexuals?  If you are going to complained about this film because of two males being sexually active or giving eachother certain looks, then also write a bunch of negative reviews about other films that contained heterosexuals doing the same thing.  Yes, this is not a good film, and yes it could have been better.  But, it had nothing to do with whether or not they were any gay scenes in them.  It just had to do with bad scripts, bad make up, fake looking hairdos, and a director who needed to be more brave and enhance certain parts of the movie and not just rush through it.  By the way, I am not gay, but am sick of people saying bad things about this film because of some gay undertone.  If you're not going to complaine about two heterosexuals kissing, holding hands, fondling each other and having sex, then don't complaine about them when you see gays do those things in the movies.",1123027200,7,1562,4.688644688644689
2310608,2,B0009PLLN6,"For those who did enjoy Oliver Stone's Alexander (I, for the record was not one of them), be warned that this is probably one of the few times in the history of Director's Cuts that the film is cut down from the Theatrical cut.  Due to what Oliver Stone perceived as America's disinterest in this movie based on the bisexual themes involved, the Director's Cut is devoid of many, if not all, references to this.  If you are a fan of the movie, make sure you know this prior to purchasing.  Personally, I think it's a bit shady of them to release a Director's Cut when the moniker is usually used for movies that had scenes cut from the theatrical version restored.

Also, in reference to the two DVD editions.  This edition is on one disc.  For the theatrical cut, I suppose because it's less than 10 minutes longer, is on two discs for the movie itself.

About the movie, though.  I guess this movie has been deeply polarizing for audience members.  I'm not sure if its because of the bisexual themes or if its because it just wasn't a good movie.  I notice people defending the film talk about the subtle nuances that Oliver Stone employed in his story.  I noticed these as well, and I applaud some of his use not only of symbolism but also imagery for a concrete reason.  However, subtle nuances and symbolism alone does not a good movie make.  Nor does it make a good epic necessarily.

When I saw this movie in the theatre, I noticed a few people leave pretty much as soon as any bisexual themes were hinted at.  The bisexual themes did not bother me in the least.  I want to get that out of the way so that I'm not immediately discounted.  I was completely aware (as I assumed most people were) that it is generally known that Alexander had feelings for his friend Hephastos.  In every single history class from junior high to College had made that pretty clear, either overtly or subtly.  If you are going to make a movie about this situation, however, you have to do it carefully.  Not only because of the apparent tumultous culture we live in today, but also because it can come across as silly.

In Alexander, this is exactly what happened.  Instead of seriously examining these issues, which would have made a very interesting to watch character in Alexander, Oliver Stone made a melodrama.  He turned Alexander into an angsty teen who bats his eyes while looking at Hephastos longingly behind locks of silly hair.  There's no emotion there besides soap opera melodrama.  Honestly, if you replaced the fact that Alexander was fawning over a female instead of Hephastos, I would still have this reaction.  It was executed very poorly.  And not only that, but seemed to be tacked on as if to make a comment and nothing more.

But its not only this that warrants my bad review.  The silliness did not stop with the love triangle.  First off, casting a woman a year older than Colin Farrel to play his mother is just odd.  Not only that, but to give her such a horribly done slavish/Transylvanian accent just undermined any sort of seriousness.  Then there's everyone else's accents that seem to change as the movie progresses.  For an epic movie, the battles are very important and the battles here were filmed so haphazardly and chaotically that yes it probably was a good representation of war, but as a movie it just doesn't work.  How can you root for the good side when you can't tell who is winning because everyone looks the same?  The movie began on a rocky start (Val Kilmer as the father figure was just as ham-handed as anything else) and only went down hill from there.  I'll admit, the first maybe half of the movie was vaguely intersting if melodramatic.  But when Alexander reaches India, things just spiraled into boredom.  My group was checking their watches, wishing for it to be over.

My gripe, then, is a more moderate one.  I don't care what the film is about.  But it was not done well.  It was boring, and for an epic film that is the one thing it shouldn't be.  For a movie to hold your attention for 3 hours or more it has to be exciting.  Alexander failed in this, as it also did in exploring his relationship with Hephastos and his wife.  It seemed hacked on as if for the only reason than a political one to say, hey look Alexander had feelings for his male friend.  In the end, a boring and melodramatic movie.",1123027200,4,4348,4.495530012771392
2310609,2,B0009PLLN6,"The only version of this movie I have seen is the Director's cut on DVD.

What a ham-handed mess.  Stone gets big-dollar backing to produce a film about the most successful military commander/ruler in history.  He can hunt and peck through 33 years of intrigue, strategy, and history and assemble, write, and tell any story he wants.  Wow what an opportunity.  How are you gonna handle this Oliver?  Not very well.

Maybe the scope of Alexander's life and achievements is simply too overwhelming, and I could see where in the right hands, this project might have come off better if it was a multi part epic - Young Alexander to the conquest of Babylon, then another film following his endless campaigning in Asia to his early demise.  But even so, others have done a better job of making a completely fictional fantasy world more meaningful than Stone's take on this slice of real history.

Stone opts for a teetering, drawn-out, fictionalized character study with no bite, no warmth, and no identifiable center.  He blows off all the military stuff (and a lot of it is very significant) except for two battles, and manages to make those two completely unfollowable.  He drags us through conversations, using 18 lines of dialogue when 2 would've sufficed.  OK, Alexander is motivated by his identification with the Greek Myths.  We get it, but 5 minutes later we are still droning on with Christopher Plummer, and later we cover the same territory with Kilmer, again.  Heck, even Batman Begins did better with this type of scene, presenting it as a montage with a sense of time and evolution, rather than an afternoon of endless whiney interrogation, with a repeat.  The same tack is taken with his conversations with his mother - 30 seconds of hackneyed dialogue repeatedly crammed into 5 minutes.  Stone may have ""toned down"" the homosexuality for this release, but it's hardly apparent.  We even get a shadowy shot of Farrell's corn-hole, taint, and junk; I guess because it's so ""important"" to the story.  Val Kilmer delivers his lines like a disappointed mill worker instead of a king, and walks around in the background to sledgehammer in the point that Alexander sometimes thinks about his father.  Oh!, and flashbacks, lots and lots of flashbacks (apparently even more than the original).  And just for fun, let's give Alexander, old AND young, Irish accents, and have Jolie imitate Christianne Amanpour.  Even the technical aspects are fairly dull.  Some tame, drowsy, uninspired location shooting, and some CGI action that clouds the battles, rather than bringing them to life.  We even get a hackneyed red tint in one scene that highlights Stone's complete lack of creativity.

At some point I just started laughing at it.  It's a $150,000,000.00 bad Mexican Soap Opera, with an occasional Ron Burgundy-ish ""..by Zeus' Beard!"" thrown in.  But it's just too long and numbing to succeed as repeat viewable campy fun.

With all of its flaws, it does teach one of history's most important lessons:  Don't ever let Oliver Stone do a movie about you.",1123027200,3,3055,4.9140625
2310610,4,B0009PLLN6,"Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned ALEXANDER and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD.  Now the film can be viewed in the relatively inexpensive milieu of the home and perhaps more folks will give another  (or, as in my case, a first) look at what the grumbling is all about.

ALEXANDER is a big film about a big person who did big things.  How a story so altered by time, history, myth, and folklore could be translated to the screen strains the imagination - but not Oliver Stone's - a man who loves big events and big issues.  And I think he succeeds in drawing us into the atmosphere of the 'civilized world' of Alexander's time.  Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) relates the history of a man who wished to tie the known world together into one empire and would have us believe that dream was altruistic as well as destined.  Through a series of flash forwards and flashbacks the birth to death of Alexander is pieced together: each time a great moment or crisis occurs in Alexander's life, the story backtracks to explain the etiological influences of that particular step in Alexander's march around the globe.

The settings of Alexander's youth in Macedonia are breathtakingly beautiful in the cave painting details of the various gods and heroes and heroines that so deeply influenced the life of Alexander - Medea, Oedipus, Herakles, Zeus, etc.  If the entire film had been able to maintain this mystic quality of ambience, this would have been a powerful work.  But once the scenes begin to disperse to Persia, India, Greece, etc the film becomes Hollywoodized and harkens back to the Cecil B. DeMille view of ancient history, garnished with expensive sets and costumes and endless dancing maidens and overwrought battle sequences.

Where this film (at least this version) is best is when it approaches the passion of Alexander for Hephaistion. Few writers or film makers have dared to enter the arena of homosexual love of heroes of history and this is where Stone takes the chance - and then unfortunately heavily edits the romance from this 'director's cut'.  A missed opportunity to examine an important aspect of neglected history is sad.

As for the cast, Colin Farrell does his best with the script he has in making us believe in Alexander, and he is able to connect the chemistry with Jared Leto's Hephaistion well. Angelina Jolie is aptly smarmy as the snake-loving Olympias, Val Kilmer's Philip, grotesquely hidden behind scars of makeup, is suitably evil, but given the tritely written roles of Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and Roxane (Rosario Dawson) the rest of the cast is forgettable.

But now that the film is available in two forms for less money than a pair of theater tickets perhaps more people will watch, plug in to Oliver Stone's concept, and the air will clear.  I, for one, think it is a film worth watching! Grady harp, August 05",1123027200,2,3049,4.825335892514396
2310611,1,B0009PLLN6,"I am so sick and tired of people who slambed this movie, because they said it contained some gay scenes.

I am not gay, but I for one will not complaine about any sexual scens, or two guys giving eachother certain looks, because for one thing they were not that many of those scenes in the film.  I am so sick and tired of people being so hypocritical of homosexuals, that it really makes me very upset.  I couldn't count just how many times that I have seen heteros kissing eachother while waiting to place an order at restaurants (which sickens me), kissing and having sex in many films (if not all of them in modern age), woman's bare breasts being shown in films, or full frontal nude scenes (mainly femals are shown) in films, sexual innuendos in films, and suggestive glances in films.  Some of the items listed above can be seen and heard on t.v. also.  How many people who wrote negatively about gay scenes ever written negative reviews about movies which involves heterosexual sex scenses, even if they are just minor scenes in the film?  If you are even uncomforable about two gay people holding hands, then are you also against two heteros holding hands with eachother?  Don't be so hypocritic!

The film itself could have been much better.  But, I applaud Oliver Stone for making this kind of film. I think in some ways he was very brave to do so.  I just wished that the film was more like Dances with Wolves.  Dances with Wolves was a long movie, but because it contained beautiful sceneries, great acting and well written scripts, this film actually moved very quickly.  In Alexander, I think the actors and actresses did what they could with this scripts that they were given. I also think the makeup and hairdos could have been better and more natural looking.  I could not help but also wished that it contained less of the battle scenes-it just dragged on.

Secondly, to the reviewers commenting on Ms. Jolie's performance in this film...you have her dead wrong. She did an oscar-worthy job. Her accent is Turkish, because Alexander's mother had a Turkish accent. In fact, she is the only actor in the film with a credible accent at all.

The overall problem here is that Oliver Stone went a bit too subtle on this movie, and Americans simply didn't get it. It's not a linear film...it jumps around. This isn't a weakness....it's SUPPOSED to jump around. The battle scenes are great, though Alexander had much more film-worthy adventures that simply are not even mentioned. But then, this movie is not intended to show Alexander's generalship....it's a movie intended to show human nature as seen through the eyes of Alexander, and through an understanding of his parents.

But honestly, I really think the amount of man-love, and glances exchanged between men,  scared off alot of Americans as well.

I really enjoyed this movie and while certain aspects of it played around with historical fact to make things more interesting for the blas American audiences, over all I thought this film to be a wonderful escape for 3 hours.  The cinematography was executed with exquisite crafting and the acting was believable and well done.

The people who are complaining about the accents, would you have preferred that this movie be totally done in Greek? Or Arabic? Or Hindi?  Would most of the people who found this movie boring and badly acted in English, actually of sat through a movie with subtitles?!  I don't think so.

It is a movie, a form of entertainment.  It is not a documentary, it is not meant to portray things exactly as they were, but to tell a story.  If you want the hard cold facts, go to the library.  Even then you will find people fighting over what is really the truth.

One last thing... the many people who have reviewed this movie and said that it had strong, if not extreme, homosexual acts... I have to ask what movie you saw; because it certainly was not this 2-Disc set.

2310616,3,B0009PLLN6,"""Newly inspired, faster paced, more action packed!"" shouts the DVD cover of Oliver Stone's ""Alexander: Director's Cut."" That new inspiration came the hard way: from the lashing ""Alexander"" took from legions of critics and from the $150 million film's humiliation at U.S. boxoffices.

Director Stone took the opportunity to re-edit key scenes, lengthening here and shortening there. A pair of flashbacks from Alexander the Great's youth now appear later in the film, shaking up the third act and making the epic less linear. But not  necessarily better.

A ""beautiful and so tender scene"" between the king and his male lover hits the floor as Stone tones down the bisexual content. ""I can't tell you how many 'real guys' are turned off to this s--t,"" Stone explains.

""Alexander II"" loses only eight minutes from the original three-hour running time, though, and the elements that inspired all that hooting and cackling remain: Colin Farrell's goofy blond locks, Alexander's Irish brogue, the odd casting of Angelina Jolie as his mother, Jolie's Natasha-the-cartoon-spy accent, and so on.

Those drawn to the DVD by the promise of an improved and intensified film won't have an experience differing all that much from the one in theaters. Expecting little -- and equipped with pause buttons -- many first-time viewers will wonder what the fuss was over this offbeat and mostly entertaining biopic -- probably best approached as an overgrown sword-and-sandal movie, a guilty pleasure.

Warner released ""Alexander"" in two double-disc sets: Stone's new cut and the original theatrical. The two versions are not available in one package, unfortunately, and fans springing for both sets will be disappointed to find nearly identical extras. Images are widescreen (about 2.40:1) with brilliant colors and steely sharpness when it is called for. The 5.1 audio deploys the battle scenes with efficiency (sorry, no DTS).

Stone works solo on the director's cut commentary. He points out the new changes and offers brief explanations for making them. The goal, basically, was ""to keep it moving."" Much of Stone's talk is repeated on the theatrical DVD's commentary, which edits in observations from historical adviser Robin Lane Fox. Stone does a good job, but the commentary with Fox is stronger and you learn a lot about the real Alexander.

Disc 2 features an hour-and-a-half documentary directed in ragged but effective style by Stone's son Sean. His total access resulted in an unusually candid portrait of a production working through a swarm of problems in lands such as Morocco, Thailand and India. Vangelis pretends to be scoring the film in a brief extra. The movie's frenzied teaser and trailer are included, both faster paced and action packed.",1122940800,2,2745,5.208616780045351

If in fact someone was to write a story of my life, what I did good for my Country or for my Family is the important parts. That is what I would want people reviewing my private life ""is my business"".

Alexander was a great Military genius.  Mr. Stone how would you feel if someone made a movie about what you did in private, instead of the great movies you have made.  How would you feel if you won an Acadamy Award on your private life and not how well you put together a movie or movie's.

Well, today I am going to give you that review.  Beings I have no Idea what your personal life is like, I am going to stay with what I do know, In the movie ""Alexander - the Directors Cut"" in my oppinion recieves a negative 5 stars.  In fact it can not even be measured.  I am sorry if this hurts your feelings, but the movie spent to much time on a persons personal life, rather than on his live endeavors as a great man.

People expecting an action movie should stay away; this is a historical biopic that displays its subject warts and all.  People who are snide about the homosexuality need to grow-up.  The film details Alexander's astonishing rise to power, the confusion of battle and leadership, and his ultimate deteriation as he begins to buy his own press, so to speak.  With a little patience for drama instead of action and an open mind, Alexander is a rich, multi-layered biopic by a troubled leader's legacy.",1122940800,9,610,5.07

The movie was so boring that after watching it I was still bored. The feeling lasted about a day and I am not exaggerating. Not only it was boring, the story line is very unrealistic eventhough this is based on history. Even with makeup, can you imagine Colin Farrell's mom is Angelina Jolie? This movie does  not highlight the greatness of Alexander the great but instead brings out every painstaking irrelevant detail that no one cares about.

Don't waste your money and time on this. I should have asked for a refund.",1122854400,4,671,4.537190082644628
2310621,1,B0009PLLN6,"As we already know, ""Alexander"" tanked at the U.S. domestic box office.  Sometimes that does not matter.  A film can be good, and not make money.  This film is bad.  Oliver Stone, who is usually very good with detail, has delivered a disjointed, overlong mixture of fact and fiction.  I have read many books about Alexander the Great.  Much of this film is fiction, bad fiction.  Major plot points, which led to the spread of Western Civilization, as we know it today, are fabrications.  Who killed Alexander's father, and why?  Whom did Alexander love and share his life with?  How and why did Alexander die?  I would say that those are very important facts.  Stone chose to fictionalize them.  One of Alexander's most important relationships was his lifelong love of Hephaistion from childhood to death.  When Alexander captured King Darius' throne tent, Darius' mother prostrated herself at the feet of Hephaistion, thinking him to be Alexander, because he seemed the more kingly figure.  When told of her mistake, she apologized.  Alexander kindly said ""Do not worry mother, he is Alexander too.""  Stone chose to turn their love into a one hug friendship.  In reality, their love for each other was so strong, that when Hephaistion died, Alexander had him deified.  Alexander was grief stricken over Hephaistion's death.  He died eight months later.  I cannot understand why Stone felt that it was okay to show the start of a sex scene between  Alexander and his eunuch Bagoas, but chose to make the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion, the love of his life, incidental.  The critics were right about Colin's bad brassy blond dye job with dark eyebrows, which was distracting.  Having Angelina Jolie, who is only one year older than Colin play his mother was as idiotic as how her character was portrayed.  The dialog is terrible.  The continuity, especially during the battle scenes, is lacking.  Sometimes using flashbacks can add to a film.  As used in ""Alexander,"" which already lacked continuity, the flashbacks make the flow of the storytelling even more incoherent.  The actors try to do their best with an unplayable script, bad direction, and miscasting.  After watching this film, one does not really know much about who Alexander the Great, the man, really was, and why he was able to accomplish what no other man before him could.  I cannot think of one good thing to say about this film.  Alexander the Great was a unique man, who had an exciting life, and helped shape the modern world.  It would seem impossible to make a bad film with such good subject matter.  Unfortunately, Oliver Stone succeeded in doing just that.",1122681600,9,2650,4.920814479638009
2310622,3,B0009PLLN6,"After I saw this movie I started to reflect on how historic characters are perceived nowadays. Alexander did not write his biography. So whoever is going to write about him, would have to use some imagination to fill the pages of the story. Throughout history people drew many faces of Alexander's personality, and each personality is definitely influenced by the human thought of its period. To me, this movie is not about Alexander, it's rather about us. Alexander the person for sure has much more complex and rich character than the one portrayed in the movie. Oliver stone used modern ""Pop culture"" pigments to paint Alexander. The hero of the movie is no different from the hero/winner of ""survivor""!

I have to admit somehow I enjoyed the movie!",1122681600,7,752,4.875
2310623,1,B0009PLLN6,"Okay, first and foremost I'm tollerant of both homosexuality and bi-sexuals, and in fact I knew going into the movie that Alexander the Great was known to have male lovers. But I obviously thought that it will be mentioned or possibly hinted at like in Sparticus. I thought it would be a movie about a world conquerer who happened to be gay, but it was almost the exact opposite. The battles were cluttered and down-played but the sexuality was the main theme of the movie. A lot of people will try to tell you that people who didn't like this movie are homophobes, but I point out that the reason people didn't like Pearl Harbor is for the exact same reason, down-play the history and increase the sexuality... It shouldn't be like that, that's a pitfall of all Hollywood historical movies. But make no mistake that was not all of the problem, Jolie was so psychotic it made me uncomfortable sitting in the theater. And as for the accents, man I think they just hearded every extra in the backlot and didn't tell them what movie they were in. If you can't stick with one regional accent, then just eliminate it. Some sounded like characters from Macbeth and some even sounded like Boris and Natasha from Bullwinkle. Insult to injury it's like 3 hours long...

You tell me Stone).  Anyway, I knew at once that I would NOT be catching this flick, therefore, Matthew Edmundson you are absolutely correct, except you paid money to see this terrible film.",1122508800,6,673,4.545454545454546

2310626,1,B0009PLLN6,"Have you ever been to a party, and one of the guests tells a really long-winded story or joke that doesn't go anywhere and makes no sense, and you keep waiting and waiting for the punch line, but there never is one, and you wish you could have those few minutes of your life back? Well, Alexander is the filmic equivalent of such an event. (Sorry for the run-on sentence!)

I am something of a history buff myself, so when I heard Oliver Stone was making a movie about Alexander the Great, I was thrilled. I've studied Alexander in both high school and University courses, and I felt that his life was so interesting, so full of intrigue that someone HAD to make a new movie about it. How, I thought, could anyone POSSIBLY screw up a movie like this? Oh, how naive I was...

The whole homosexuality bit was pathetic. Oliver Stone doesn't have the first clue about history, nor the subject matter. Keep one thing in mind: Alexander is widely considered to be the greatest military genius of ALL TIME. That means many historians believe that he was greater than Napoleon, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, Pyrrhus, Scipio Africanus, etc. That's quite an achievement, to put it lightly. There is an old story, somewhat apocryphal, where a 26 year old Julius Caesar walks by a statue of Alexander the Great and begins to weep, because at that age Alexander had already conquered most of the known world, and Caesar had done nothing. So Oliver Stone decides to focus on his relationship with males rather than showing us WHY Alexander is the greatest military commander of all time. We never get any idea of why a man like Julius Caesar would weep before a statue of a foreigner.

The fact is that we are using contemporary concepts in an ancient setting where they would have been alien to the population. There  was no concept of homosexuality as we see it today. No ""coming out of the closet"" or any of that. In fact, a lot of military leaders, politicians, philosophers, etc., had relationships with men. Julius Caesar is well known for his debauchery (he was known to be ""every woman's husband and every man's wife""). Socrates also had male lovers. Oliver Stone thinks he's actually being controversial by showing the relationship with Hephaestion. Big deal. I don't think he realizes how completely clueless he is!

Probably the greatest tragedy of this movie is Val Kilmer. One of the greatest actors of our generation, he is given nothing to work with.  The poor guy even gained 50 pounds for his role. I always felt that a movie about Philip II would be interesting, but since the average person doesn't know who he is, I can keep dreaming. I should have known this movie would be awful when Angelina Jolie was cast as Alexander's MOTHER, when she's ONE YEAR OLDER THAN COLIN FARRELL! What's next, Martin Landau as Alexander's infant son?

Against all my better judgment I bought a ticket for this movie, and what can I say, I was duped. They got me hook, line and sinker. This movie is a total waste. Thanks to Stone, I doubt another Alexander movie will ever be attempted. The only thing Oliver Stone got out of it was that he's now the laughing stock of the community, and rightfully so. Well actually, that's not true. He also accomplished the mighty feat of making the Richard Burton version look about a hundred times better.",1122508800,13,3325,4.644557823129252
2310627,5,B0009PLLN6,"I wanted to let people know that they should pick up the original cut of the film, not the Director's Cut. Instead of adding scenes, in the Director's Cut they took out scenes. The studio told Oliver Stone to take more of the gay and hertosexual undertones out of the film so Colin Farrell will be more like Brad Pitt in TROY. This was Warner Bros. decision not Oliver Stones, so if you want the real director's cut get the original cut of the film with everything that Oilver Stone wanted in his film. You actually get more for the same amount of money, all the features are the same as the Director's Cut DVD but if you get the original cut you get a longer film.

2310629,4,B0009PLLN6,"To say the truth, I don't understand why most people think so poorly of this movie.

I liked it, pediod.

Although I'm not a big fan of Colin Farell, (he has a face of an alcoholic in some magazine photos)I still think that he fits well for the role of Alexander, and plays the role fairly well. Now, Angelina Jolie is a whole different matter. I don't think she is of an appropriate age to be even considered his mother, she's more of an older sister to him. Another thing is that they don't change her appeareance around much in the movie. Meaning, that from the time Alexander was little, to the time he's an adult her face changes only slightly (they add a few bags under her eyes here and there). I don't think she's fit for the role at all.

In terms of action and all, it was pretty good in its own way. Each movie has its own distinguished characteristics, and maybe some parts were gloomy, but it was good.

The only other thing I don't like is all the drinking and also the girl who becomes Alexander's wife (she isn't pretty, not at all).

I liked the camera work, the background, and the settings. The constant change in their environment, like the mountains, and forests, and desert.

All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining. Think of it this way, if you have seen ""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Alexander"" is much better, and far less confusing. For instance you don't have these leaps in battles from nightime to daytime all of a sudden. Also you don't have weird, ugly women shaving off their hair for no reason (I have basically slept through a part of that movie, and I *never* do that).

Anyway, I think that if you have not seen this movie in the theaters, you should at least rent it at Blockbuster and try it at home.

2310630,3,B0009PLLN6,"Years ago a commentator wrote about Oliver Stone's *JFK* (1991) that it's the best bad movie ever made.  Well, I do believe the title has transferred to Stone's *Alexander* (2004).  This epic deserves a nod for valiant effort.  And stylistically it does shine.  But *Alexander* is too long, attempts too much, and so is weakened by its effort to be great--just as the lust for greatness weakened to death the historical Emperor Alexander even in his youthful years.

Nontheless I would  recommend you buy the *Alexander* DVD if you're a fan of director Stone and/or of the leading actors--Colin Farrel, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer.  Their talent is on ample display here.  But after the first viewing you'll probably watch just the parts of *Alexander* that you like, by using the scene selection feature of the DVD's menu page as I do.

I'm a Jolie fan, so I want to offer here a comment on her performance as Olympias (375-316 BC), wife of King Philip II of Macedonia and mother of Alexander the Great.  It's a role unique to her career--before this, Ms Jolie never played a historical personage.  She's positively captivating, the way she brings forth from the mists of time this sinister but beautiful queen who was like a razor-edged steel sword sheathed inside an exotic scabbard of precious materials and fine craftmanship.

Some reviewers say her performance is ""OTT"" (over the top).  Not at all.  Ms Jolie is commanding as Olympias, but never over-acts.  Some reviewers dismiss the accent she puts on.  Well, the accent was director Stone's call.  He wanted to impress his audience that Olympias was a foreigner to Macedonia.  Often her accent is said to be ""Romanian"", which it isn't.  (I know a few Romanians; none speaks English the way Ms Jolie does in *Alexander*.)  Actually her accent is quite similiar to the one she used in *Love is All There Is* (1994), when she played Gina, an Italian girl.  I'd say it's more Hungarian than Italian.  (Probably why it's called a Romanian accent is that it reminds people of the way Bela Lugosi spoke in his role as Dracula.  OK: the historical Dracula was a prince of what is called Romania today; and to get technical, Mr. Lugosi was born in Romania; but he was Hungarian by family and his accented English is typical of Hungarians.)  For *Alexander* Ms Jolie takes Gina's (Italo-Hungarian?) accent, mellows it down (she's a grown woman now, not an excited teenager), and puts more of a trill on the R's.

The historical Olympias was a princess from the borderlands of ancient northwestern Greece, a kingdom called Epirus. A district of modern NW Greece still bears that name.  The original kingdom included part of Albania.  Except for the dynasty into which Olympias was born, the people of Epirus were barbarians by the standards of Greek civilization.  In the film, Olympias is mocked as such by Philip and other Macedonian aristocrats because she came from a royal house that ruled barbarians.

According to *The Encyclopedia Brittanica*, Olympias ""had a passionate and imperious nature, and she played important roles in the power struggles"".  Ms Jolie brings that nature to the screen most effectively.  About the things we see Olympias getting up to, though, there seems to be some historical inaccuracies.

For example, in the film she and Alexander are shown to be present in Macedonia when Philip is assassinated (336 BC).  Supposedly mother and son were direct witnesses to the regicide.  The movie tells us Olympias was suspected--even by Alexander--of being behind the murder. But according to the *Brittanica*, Olympias withdrew with Alexander to Epirus when the polygamous Philip married a high-born Macedonian woman.  (It was by this woman that the Macedonian king had a son, Philip III, who is shown in the film as a baby at the time of Philip II's death.)  Olympias and Alexander returned from Epirus to Macedonia only after the assassination.  The *Brittanica* confirms that suspicion indeed fell upon Olympias--and upon Alexander along with her.  But no less an authority than the philosopher Aristotle, himself Alexander's tutor and a Macedonian, dismissed this suspicion as unfounded.  Philip was killed by a nobleman, Pausanias, for reasons that had nothing to do with Olympias and Alexander.

Still, Olympias was hardly pure-white as the driven snow.  After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, she had Philip III, his wife, and over a hundred of their supporters assassinated.  This she did to clear the way for her grandson (also named Alexander) to assume the throne.  Olympias the assassin of a teen prince and princess, and a hundred others!  THAT should have been in the movie!  Eventually she herself was murdered by the relatives of those she had killed.

I was moved by Ms Jolie's role as a mother ""who loves too much.""  Olympias, the snake-adoring sorceress who insists the son she loves too much was fathered by a god, not by the Macedonian king Philip, meshes seamlessly with the real Jolie image--the lovely yet dangerously eccentric actress of high Hollywood lineage whose son is hers not by biology but by love alone.  Another point of note is that her performance of a mature woman, old enough to have a grownup son, is a compelling foretaste of Jolie roles to come.",1122422400,,5259,4.929465301478953
2310631,5,B0009PLLN6,"This film is captivating and intense in all ways. It speaks to me on a variety of levels. Pre-Christian decadence is not the vogue material for modern critics. My personal theory as to the poor reviews - THIS FILM IS TOO INTELLIGENT AND PASSIONATE FOR THE MASSES AND CRITICS FEARED A LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR BACKLASH. Take that for what it is but this film helps confirm the best and worst about the human race's story. It is amazing to witness the young idealism turn to disillusion and the heat of love and war in such a colorful way. The first war front and the wedding night scenes take several reviews to appreciate. All of the cast give and the director takes nothing from this awesome movie. I saw it four times in the theater - always improving with each view.

I know I provided a macrogeneral opinion - give this movie a chance. Enjoy it. It is ahead of it's time.",1122163200,17,876,4.440993788819876
2310632,2,B0009PLLN6,"The director thought he could fool intelligent people who know their historical facts by spending a lot of money on lavish sets, costume and cast. The movie starts out OK, but it then starts exploring Alexander's sexual affairs with a Persian enuch and how his love life affected his dicisions. People much rather expected to see more suspense, strong line exchanges between the actors, and less of Alexander's relationship with that enuch. I don't think his affair was even relevant to history. People who see historical epics are usually intelligent and knowledgable people or either deep thinkers who expect more from a historical epic. The costumes and sets were great, but the director didn't even bother to get his facts straight anout the little details like the Persian wedding (which is much more elaborate) the Greek and Persian war techniques which were much more sophisticated, and the conversations between the enemies. He didn't even get the costumes right despite their beauty. Persian war attire was very different. Instead you get to see ""the sexual life"" of Alexander which has no relevance to what he accomplished nor was it a relavant historical point. I could go on and on but I think you get my picture. So two stars for set, costumes and cast. Three lacking stars for the lacking history!

2310633,3,B0009PLLN6,"I saw ""Alexander"" in a theatre and can not imagine viewing it on a small screen at home. The sets, the cinematography, the scope of the film, and all the rest require a large screen. Additionally, Colin is a fine actor but was miscast in this film. An actor with stunning presence was needed and Brad Pitt probably would have been a better choice had he not just appeared in ""Troy."" If not Mr. Pitt, then an unknown actor might have been a better choice. Oliver Stone obviously spent a number of years in pre-production for this motion picture and certainly his heart was in it all the way. It was obvious that what he was able to do in recreating ancient great cities and palaces is cinema at its best.

Why did Mr. Stone let us down with such weakly written love scenes between Alexander and Hephaestion? This, after all, is the 21st century, and is it not now time for us to start seeing accurate portrayals of historic figures? For me to learn that the ""Director's Cut"" has the male ""love"" scene, as weak as it was, deleted is an absolute joke. Is this edition for the Bible Belt set or for viewers whose IQ matches their age? Will this set be rated ""G?"" Let the buyer beware on this one.

I did want to own a copy of the non-edited down version but after I heard about the Bible Belt Special Director's Cut, being produced (or hacked out) I will save my money. if Mr. Stone is setting his sights on the uneducated masses, it is a true disappointment. He is a brilliant film producer and I am wondering what his reason is for this version.

One final note is that the soundtrack to ""Alexander"" is one of the finest ever written. It is unmatched in its majesty - a joy to listen to over and over.  The score gives you the feeling of the intent of the film possibly more successfully than the film itself.  It certainly is a winner from Mr. Vangellis.

2310634,1,B0009PLLN6,"This was the worst darn movie I ever saw! Well not quite, but ""Alexander"" DEFINITELY does not live up to expectations, and falls at ""Troy's"" feet like an old beggar woman in the dust! Alexander was too boring to be this long! I can stand 3 hours with no problem for a fantastic movie like The Lord of the Rings, but I actually started to writhe in my cinema seat and become hysterical, waiting for this film to finish!

I think this film dealt with Alexander's sexuality rather cowardly! We all know that ancient Greeks had bisexual and homosexual preferences, and this film kicked up a load of hype about how it was going to accurately portray this, but in the end it chickened out, prefering to show Alexander and his male lover Hephaistion as more like brotherly soul mates! However, there was t! ts galore when it came to the women in his life, including an extremely inappropriate scene in which Alexander and his wife (Rosario Dawson) engage in a violent fight, during which her top is ripped off and her breasts are fully exposed (yet they continue to fight)! The indignity of it shames me! Of course she is not the 1st woman to engage in topless fight scenes. Once upon a time there was a mistress of martial arts named Oyuki in Babycart in Peril, who had similar habits. I shall say no more!

Good points? Well it's hard to think of any - when the film ended perhaps? lol! Well there was Angelina Jolie, who was as beautiful as ever, though perhaps she should have been playing Aphrodite rather than an old queen! Rosario Dawson was very beautiful too, though after being blinded by her exposed bosoms it was difficult to see her clearly!

And one very strange observation I made whilst watching this film was that Colin Farrell seemed unable to disguise or suppress his Irish accent, though he tried, and therefore all the other actors in his scenes put on weird and unconvincing Irish accents so that Farrell wouldn't stand out! Did ancient Greek sound like Irish?

All in all, a bad film. If you like battle epics, choose Troy, Lord of the Rings, or even Kingdom of Heaven (which wasn't much better than this, but is an improvement). Personally I am unable to watch movies any more as my eyesight has still not returned to me after being flashed by Rosario Dawson's knockers!",1121990400,9,2287,4.570731707317073
2310635,1,B0009PLLN6,"After viewing this movie, one thing is for certain, the Greeks, according to Oliver Stone, were Irish, at least the ones who worshiped Dionysius.  Angelina Jolie gives a much better performance and much more convincing one, considering she does not age a single day from the birth of Alexander to his death at age 30ish.  At least her accent is decidedly from the Mediterranean.  Even Anthony Hopkins, who is such a great actor, can't seem to nail it down, his prim and proper English is just too out of place, but Colin Ferrell and the majority of the other actors have such a thick Irish accent that it detracts from what could have been a decent movie, and I mean thicker than Irish soda bread soaked in a pint of Guinness.  The movie itself is not bad, and the acting, apart from the blatant disregard for dialect, is decent, it's no where near as stiff or bad as Kevin Costner in Robin Hood, but the, damn near Gaelic, accent that Colin Ferrel and the other actors use in the movie far out-shadows, Costner's lack of a English accent in Robin Hood.  It just detracts from the movie so much it actually makes it hard to watch.  The action sequences are top notch; the cinematography is very well done, it's just those accents, they're everywhere.  I am afraid that Oliver Stone did not have any speaking roles for the Persians as they probably spoke fluent Mandarin, though they looked the part.  This movie in short is a rental at best and a one time watch at that.",1121904000,3,1470,4.5
2310636,3,B0009PLLN6,"ALEXANDER DIRECTOR'S CUT (Warner) is Oliver Stone's ""re-configuration"" (his words) of his sweeping bio-epic of the world's greatest warrior-conqueror and, apparently, bisexual.

The original $140 million (not counting advertising) theatrical release was reviled by critics and shunned by audiences, earning a paltry $30 some million in the U.S.

After a decades long fascination with Alexander the Great, Stone was shocked and humiliated at the public reaction and immediately started re-imagining his film for the digital edition.  Stone cut nearly 20 minutes from the theatrical release and added about ten minutes of unseen footage.  Hundreds of additional edits dramatically reshaped dozens of sequences.  In addition, he removed a significant and controversial homo-erotic love scene between Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his male lover. What was originally mocked as ""Alexander the Gay"" is now less so.

Compared to the theatrical release, Stone's ""Director's Cut"" is a misnomer.  After all, the first release was also his cut.  However, this DVD is a different film; better because it is more accessible.  The action has been beefed up and the once confusing narrative is easier to follow.  And the already magnificent score by Vangelis seems somehow more effective on this new cut.

Stone is a bold, inventive, visionary director who takes chances with controversial material.  However, his attempt to get under the skin (no pun intended) and create a psychological and emotional portrait of this extraordinary historical figure who conquered the known world by the age of 33 over two millennia ago has not been fully realized.

But make no mistake, in the midst of awesome images of breathtaking scope, savage violence, and revealing intimacy there are also unexpected moments of insight into a puzzling, complex and paradoxical character.  I'm referring to both Alexander and Stone himself.

Stone's dense commentary on this cut is way above the norm, with tons of historical information as well as personal observations.  But the secret thing that drove Alexander -- and why the director's obsession with him -- are still a mystery.  The second disc's feature length documentary on the film's production by Sean Stone (Oliver's son) are nicely done, refreshingly raw and unpretentious.

Who knows, maybe this is only a work-in-progress that will eventuall undergo more changes and, like a great artist painting over a flawed canvas, Stone will eventually reveal the masterpiece that lurks beneath the surface of what is probably the most expensive vanity production of all time.",1121817600,13,2589,5.413965087281795

2310638,3,B0009PLLN6,"While I usually don't write reviews, I felt that this movie needed a review which neither built it up or struck it down, but instead pointed out both the good and the bad to those who are intrested.

Personally I found Alexander to be an enjoyable movie. Contrary to what most people and critics say, I believe that Collin Farrel along with the whole cast of this movie managed to pull off their roles and create characters which were believable and worked to support the movie through its 3 hours.  In addition, Oliver Stone has created a pretty close to historically correct movie filled with visual eye-candy from the walls of Babylon to the jungles of India.

However, this movie does have its flaws and the first and foremost one would be its length. There was no need for it to be 3 hours, in fact thinking it over, right off the bat I could name at least 3 or 4 scenes which could be cut to shorten the length of the film.  Also, as any other greek hollywood production, Alexander has fallen to the bane of accents, where each actor has a different idea of how people in the ancient world would sound.

Overall I would recomend seeing it, just to form your own opinion. But if you do, be prepared for a LONG ride, because that is what it is.",1121817600,2,1248,4.362068965517241
2310639,1,B0009PLLN6,"I am a huge military history buff and couldn't wait for this movie to come out. I rushed to see the first showing opening day. I almost walked out three times and kept saying to myself it must get better, IT MUST GET BETTER. If Alexander in real life was anything like he was in this movie,he wouldn't have been able to conquer a small group of sheep on a hill, much less Persia. Where is the  military leadership in this movie? The battle scenes make you want to stand up scream and cry they are so BAD. Don't be fooled by other reviews - THE BATTLE SCENES STINK! I collect war movies,epics,dramas and was even a extra in two war movies when I was younger. In the India battle about 1/2 way through a  red filter appears, that was the last straw for me. There is NO connection with Alexander and his army in the movie, no inspiration, no comradery. When I saw a review saying battles scenes are great I could not stop laughing and wondered what rock that person has been hiding under. Olive Stone was out of his league making this movie, he does  not understand war and leadership. Alexander the Great is considered the GREATEST Commander of all time, you would never know watching this movie. Stick to books and documentaries to learn about the great man.

All the other stuff Oliver Stone threw into movie was like salt in a open wound.

Save your money you will be able to buy a very cheap used copy of this movie, if you must see it.

I can't tell you what my other  friends said about movie as we where walking out and on way home. LOL, actually come to think of it, maybe it is worth seeing this movie with a bunch of friends. You will laugh later at how bad it is and at the things people will say after watching it.",1121817600,5,1724,4.237804878048781
2310640,4,B0009PLLN6,"And I'm very glad it is. It wasn't as good as it could have been, given the budget, cast, and director. But it wasn't as bad as others have made it out to be.

I find great irony in the fact that Oliver Stone, long known for playing it fast and loose with history/reality, has been catching the guff for FINALLY getting one pretty historically accurate. If I have any disagreement with Stone's style, it would have been in maybe being a bit TOO accurate. Some of this could have been cut out and we never would have missed it. While I applaud the bravery in showing Alexander's bisexuality, as someone else has pointed out--we didn't need to see every single male lover he had. However, I also applaud the fact that the scenes were very tastefully done. The scene where Alexander invites the Persian male lover was far more sensual and erotic that the scene with Roxana, where they're slapping the crap out of each other.

I agreed with one reviewer that Colin Farrell was never quite the leader. But at the same time, he did have that silver tongue. He was not as unidimensional as some have suggested. Farrell explored Alexander's charismatic side as well as his sadistic side. The character was well rounded thanks to a great actor.

I wish there had been more of Val Kilmer, but I don't think Phillip really shaped Alexander as much as his mother, played flawlessly by Angelina. Although where she got that accent...well, she still gave a very intense performance.

The only complaint I had with this movie is that terrible score. Incredible battle scenes with the most wimpy music I've ever heard in my life. It's really true that the musical score can make or break a film. And this movie would have been tons better with a different score.

All in all, Alexander got a bad rap and an undeserved bad review. To compare it with Troy is not fair or correct. What few flaws this movie had do not justify ignoring it. I, for one, have been salivating over the release of Alexander. I can't wait until I have it in hand.",1121731200,4,2021,4.526027397260274
2310641,2,B0009PLLN6,"Ok i was never a big fan of Oliver stone. I went to see the film pretty much for Angelina Jolie.  Now first of all, pretty much all the actors speak with an irish accent!!?? Colin Farell did a good job by influencing all the other actors. Except angelina Jolie who speaks with some unknown unnecessary accent..

I read some reviews about whether or not alexander was gay and some complained about the gay scenes. Now maybe we haven't seen the same movie BUT WHAT GAY SCENES?? there is nothing in this movie that is unpolitical correct and no gay scenes. Yes Alexander winks at Jare Leto once in while and what's the big deal?? if people are offended by it, well don't go to the movies anymore!!!

and then what happened to Oliver Stone who was known to do controversal movies.???? why did he lose his edge that made him famous??. And really what's the fuss?? Maybe in Europe they had the movie uncut but here in northern america land of the good preachers,  we had a bland version of this movie.

2310642,2,B0009PLLN6,"This movie is painful - for me, at least. I was elated the first time I saw it, simply because - Wow, it was Alexander! On the big screen... And the visuals *are* pretty - Alexandria, Pella (what we see of it), Babylon, Bagoas, the Hindu-Kush, ""India,"" Alexander's horse... The accents didn't bother me, and I also had no problem with any of the acting. I believed Colin's blindly passionate Alexander and Angelina's utterly ruthless Olympias and all the rest that so many people seem to have found fault with. It could be my tendency to never blame actors unless they are consistently bad with no improvement in any of their films... or it could be that the actor's really did do the best they could with the material they were given to work with. I blame directors and writers far more than I ever blame actors. The writers I blame for not coming up with better scripts and directors I blame for not getting the performances they should have. In both cases, the fault for this one lies solely with Oliver Stone. He dropped the ball with ""Alexander,"" no doubt about it. (By the time I was watching the Indian battle for the second time, I was quite sure of that fact. Just thinking of that scene makes me hope he has a good shrink... cause, much as it pains me to say it, I think only a really, really crazy - and not even in a remotely good way - director could have thought doing the scene in bad acid-trip colors was a good idea.)

The film lacked focus. I can understand how it is difficult to make a coherent two to three hour film about the life of a legendary conqueror who could not have possibly done any more in his 33 years. But Stone seemed so torn between the different aspects he was trying to convey - the king, the soldier, the man, the boy, the friend to point out a few - that his overall image was completely fragmented. I think what Oliver was trying to go for was a sense of a man who did great things rather than a man who was great; he was going for Alexander's human side while showing us, the audience, that there's a legit reason he's the immortal Magnus Alexandros to history. He had problems and dysfunctional relationships with both his parents. He had oedipal issues with his mother. His life was almost constantly in danger from all sides from the day he was born. He had very few friends he could truly trust and those he did have were constantly in danger of loosing their lives due to palace intrigue and jealous rivals. He lived fast, died young and left a good looking corpse. That should have made for a much better movie! But it didn't 'cause Oliver doesn't know how to focus and stick with a plan. Even with the DVDs he didn't know how to do that 'cause he did the Director's Cut to see if he could ""fix"" it by deleting some stuff for the more squeamish audiences and changing things around chronologically for the historically challenged. Time will tell if that worked or not, but personally, I doubt it.

Also, personal peeve of mine... I couldn't stand the fact that Oliver seemed so much to want to imply Alexander's sexual leanings, but because of the way he went about it, half the audience was disgusted by the degree to which he did and the other half by the degree to which he didn't pull that off successfully, and in the end, he pleased very few people. When in doubt, tell the truth or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot, and that's a lesson Oliver is having to learn the hard way. I nearly puked at that unnecessary, not to mention rife with historic inaccuracies (I don't know what that little gold ""belt"" thing or the tattoos were supposed to be about), scene between Alexander and Roxane. Love scenes are fine, but *that* was gratuitous! It almost seemed an apology to a certain portion of the audience for the Alexander/Hephaestion hug scenes and the making eyes at pretty Bagoas scenes... which was a real disappointment. I say, either go for it or don't. We should be able to come far enough out of the celluloid closet by now to leave that kind of ambiguity behind. I understand why that's apparently not so, but personally, I would have liked to see the same kind of vague relationship between Alexander and Roxane as Oliver gives us between Alexander and his lovers.

So overall, the movie was painful for me to watch because of the lack of focus and definition. I think Oliver Stone could have done much better if only he had the guts to do it. But he didn't... He should have taken his own ""subtitle"" to heart. ""Fortune favors the bold""... or, to put it in more modern terms, ""No guts, no glory.""",1121558400,6,4569,4.430439952437574
2310643,5,B0009PLLN6,"<h5>If you have an IQ under 100 chances are you WILL NOT get this movie but the direction is amazing as well as the cast are all in top form especially Colin and Angelina who is the quintessential original ice princess who cares more about her vanity than her family.

 People make themselves look so stupid when they say there is too much homosexuality in it, fact is there was practically none and the truth remains that Hephaistion was Alexanders very breath yet in the movie all you see are subtle moments about their feelings and nothing too overt, except when Hephaistion dies and Alexander feels he has nothing left to live for, Colin does an amazingly heartbreaking job of portraying the isolation and pain Alexander must have felt so many centuries ago.

For the most part the movie is historically accurate but there are a few wrong things here and there but it in no way takes away from the majesty and splendor of this movie.

If you have an open mind and know the story of the REAL Alexander you will find this film enthralling.

Several moronic critics have claimed it's confusing but its one of the few films of historical siginificance that follows a real linear time table to the conclusion and if you have brainpower you understand whats going on not to mention the cinematography is purely evocative, Naturally if you have trouble with being polysyllabic you will find this film to be a challenge and should do yourself and the memory of this brilliant film a favor and NOT see the film to only denegrate it out of ignorance or narrow-mindedness!",1121558400,4,1565,4.655797101449275
2310644,1,B0009PLLN6,"There are just so many flaws in this movie; so where to start? What I remember most about this movie might be its least important aspect: the accents are all over the place. Example: Angelina Jolie's character who plays Alexander mother is supposed to be Asian according to the movie, but has an overwhelming Russian accent. This amused me at first, but by the end of the movie, I was just annoyed. Oh, another problem with Alexander's mommie dearest was that she is surely not old enough to be the mother of a 20 or 30 year old. One last problem with her was that she made out with her son (?) and then slaps him or spits on him or something to that effect.

To be honest, I can't remember much about this movie, which is ironic considering I felt that I spent a lifetime in the theatre. What I do remember, though, was that I couldn't figure out whether this one character was a man or a woman until he/she took off his/her shirt. Turns out he was a man who makes out with Alexander and makes his wife VERY jealous. The whole ""Alexander is gay"" aspect was very confusing and badly done, in my opinion. It disturbed the plot...

Oh, wait, now that I think of it, there is no plot to disturb. That's all I have to say about the plot, since I didn't understand it nor do I remember it after all this time. Oh, other than the script is bad and this movie is WAY WAY WAY too long. [<- huge understatements]

That's all I remember about the content. The only other thing I can remember right now is that there were many other problems with the movie regarding continuity and storyline.",1121472000,2,1581,4.298657718120805

Colin Farrell to me should have gotten the Oscar for Best Actor, and he did a magnificant job. Before you see the picture read a book about Alexander and you will enjoy the movie better.

2310647,2,B0009PLLN6,"I began reading these reviews and was quite happy most of the reviewers felt that the problem with Alexander had more to do with storytelling and such than Angelina Jolie's role (I am one of her biggest, biggest fans).  One thing I was even happier to see was that one reviewer thought it was amazing...amazing it seems, for all the wrong reasons.  Yes, Alexander the Great had a penchant for other men...big deal.  That's not what the movie was about.  That was just something to grab people's interests.  I think people, during production no doubt, realized that the story itself wasn't good enough that they added extra scenes showing off Alexander's gayness.  It's almost as saying, ""This is Alexander the Great.  Why do we call him 'The Great,' you ask? Why, it's because he was gay!""  That's not why he was great.  He was great because of all the amazing things he did, all the new civilizations he discovered (or just found because after all, civilizations know they're there, its just everyone else who doesn't), all the places he had trekked for some reason or another.

The biggest reason I went to go see this movie was (as if there were any doubt) Angelina Jolie.  I admire her so much as an actress and as a person, I have committed myself to see every movie she's ever done and to own them as well.  She was absolutely amazing (and this isn't the biased attitude talking) all except for her accent.  I don't know what was going on with that.  No one else really had an accent so why she did, I'll never know.  I will chalk it up as someone thinking it'd be a fun idea and Angelina just giving it her best shot.  She did a really good accent...I just didn't think it was right for her character... in fact, I don't even know who's character that would be right for.

Another favorite of mine is Val Kilmer.  He played a wonderful Alexander's father, which I'm sure is not easy to do, with that piece of special effect covering up his eye which ""threw off his equilibrium"" as he joked on set in an Rolling Stone (I believe) article.  Alexander's father is someone everyone is supposed to hate.  And I certainly hated Val as he drunkenily pushed himself onto Angelina's character and denounced Alexander in a--big surprise--drunken rage.  I thought Val Kilmer did an absolutely great job.

The third and final real reason I saw Alexander was because of it's lead actor, Colin Ferral.  Honestly, who can resist that man?  He wasn't all that great to be honest.  But, I am convinced it is not his fault.  He did the best he could do with what he was given.

All in all, Alexander isn't that bad of a movie, it just falls victim to something that's very common in Hollywood nowadays: bad writing.

I will definitely be buying this DVD opening day.",1120780800,5,2755,4.533468559837728

(Alexander the psychotic would have been a good title), the single biggest problem with this movie is that it never really takes off!

The entire movie seems like a prologue narrated by Anthony Hopkins. I sat after the punishing 3 hours of the movie and until the very last moments I was waiting for a complelling moment of story telling. It never materialized.

So in true hollywood fashion, they are claiming that the ""Director's Cut"" will put a great shine on this great turd. Somehow, it is most doubtful.

2310649,4,B0009PLLN6,"I like heroes who can bend the flow of the history and bring the unilluminated people into a new world order. Naturally, I expected a grand spectacle movie to be unfolded to describe a conqueror's history, or worse a reverse history from the viewpoint of the conquered.

However, Colin Farrel was not a conqueror, but a man of homosexuality and a man of stricken pursuer for the undead. First, I thought he was chasing the king, Darius III, fled from the battle scene. However, he did not stop at the corps of Darius III; he saw something intangible and chased it all the way into the land of India. Defeated by a pack of unseen wildlife and unexpectedly humid and rainy climates, he was dragged back by his own men into his own civilized world.

The movie seems to be focusing on the phantom resided in his mind, not a conqueror's history that could be always rewritten as the winner-sided stories. This resulted in the unexpected success of the superficial and unadorned appeal against the misery of war, because Alexander was the misery itself obsessed by the phantom. The unfathomable mysteries could be explained by this phantom entity, which would hold the key to the simple questions such as why he married with a local woman of no political values.

The idol image of Alexander the great was established at the history class in school days, but totally shattered with the attack of phantom phalanx! A solution for the reality of the great hero is worth watching at any rate.",1120262400,10,1482,4.6923076923076925
2310650,5,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander is a truly great movie.  It deals with the greatest military hero of all time, who, like most of the Ancient Greek heroes, loved men.  In the end, Alexander dies of a double broken heart.  He died due to an end to conquest and the death of his male life-partner.  It is this central same-sex love aspect of Alexander that caused the silly homophobic American reviewers to gag, as their fathers gagged when Sidney Poitier came to dinner and kissed a white woman.  One day their silly reactions will seem as incomprehensible as the racist reactions of their fathers.  Alexander is a great movie about a great man, who was as powerful sexually as he was on the battlefield.  As they used to say about another great military leader: Julius Caesar, ""He was every woman's man and every man's woman.""  I can't see Alexander or Julius Caesar or Jesus Christ (for that matter) worrying about Tella Tubbies or Sponge Bob Square Pants being covert promoters of a gay lifestyle.  Let's stop being children and grow up.  Alexander made his vision of a world of cooperative cultures a reality, and broke the conventions of his time.  He also broke the conventions of our time, by loving where his heart led him.  We used to think the truth would set us free.  We, now, willingly enslave ourselves in blind faith to what can be proven as untrue.  I prefer to search for the truth.  The truth is that Alexander was a great man, who loved Hyphistion from his youth to his death.  The truth is that being gay doesn't make a man less than other men, but may even make him more.  It is that truth which is so offensive to those who insist on believing that your sexual desire determines your worth as a human being.  Alexander, the man and the movie, prove this view to be wrong.  The liars hate being called liars.

2310653,4,B0009PLLN6,"I saw this movie at first release, and found myself over the next few weeks appalled at the critical panning going on, primarily by reviewers who found it easy to snigger at an accurate portrayal of ancient Greece.  What was even odder, many the critics that panned ALEXANDER approved of TROY - a movie in which not one significant human emotion is shared by any character, and in which Homer's story is outrageously altered to suit Hollywood values.  I'm still shaking my head at some of the criticisms this flawed but fascinating movie has called forth!

I finally decided that the critical pans surrounding the movie were not so much for the flaws of the film - and there ARE flaws - as because your average viewer can't make an easy connection with either Alexander, his legend, or his pagan world. It's simply too titanic, and requires too much knowledge and energy, to involve most viewers.  Who can relate to a man who may have thought he was a god?  I also found myself wondering, given the viciousness of many reviews, if it was simply ""payback time"" for Oliver Stone.

The biggest problem any director faces with Alexander is one of context - how to make us connect with the greatest conqueror in the world, a bisexual ancient Greek, whose whole conceptions of honor and glory are, in our diminished age, food for chortles and embarrassment. And, of course, trying to make a major film about a bisexual character helped kill the film stone dead in the USA and Europe.  Interestingly, its box office farther east - from Persia to VietNam - helped remake most of its investment within months of the opening.  There's a fascinating thought!  The very people whom Alexander conquered seemed to have been more tolerant about his sexuality as well as his conquests.  What amazed me was not where the movie ALEXANDER failed, but where it succeeds.

It's over-the-top, crammed with riches cinematographically, full of intrigue, passion, anger, loss, disillusionment, and the simply alien nature, to most of us, of the values of a nearly-invisible pre-Christian past. There are so many scenes that just leap out and grab you - Philip of Macedon (oddly played by Val Kilmer, but with a certain brute pathos) taking the young boy Alexander through a cave filled with the blood and tragedy of the old Greek legends like Medea and the disasters of Troy - the battle at Gaugemela where the King of Kings stoically watches his Persian army fall apart - the moment where the boy Alexander rides Bucephalus for the first time - the entry into Babylon (talk about CGI wonders!) and the look on Colin Farrell's face where he has found ""the sweet fruition of an earthly crown"" - then the disintegration of the years-long army traveling ever further west, into more and more alien country (just like Stone tries to take US into alien time and country), the ambitions of the generals, their hostility to granting vanquished Persians rights in what they - but not Alexander - foresee as simply a Macedonian plunder fest, the slow desintegration of Alexander himself . . . the story is waaaaay too big, and way too long, but historically I think it covers every possible aspect of the development and death of this extraordinary man. At the final battle scene, where in India the foe is using war-elephants, monsters to the Greek soldiers, and Alexander's troops flee from these monsters, only to have Alexander and Bucephalus, in a kind of horrified courage, charge straight at the beasts with tragic consequences . . . is incredible visual filmmaking at its best. The death of Alexander after a despairing and angry drinking bout, delicately treads all the ambiguities about the man and his early death. Stone follows the line of many scholars who suggest that it was Alexander's disillusionment with the man he had become a significant emotional element in a career the world itself viewed as miraculously successful.

I also disagree with those who down Colin Farrell.  I thought Farrell did a fine job as Alexander, and it's important to remember, Stone directed him to play to the ambiguities of his character, to take no simple solutions for granted.

Stone gave a remarkable interview last winter in which he sketched his concept of the ""parallel stories"" - Alexander's past intruding into Alexander's present - and frankly declared that he felt he'd been too obscure for most audiences and would re-cut the film for video release to emphasize a more chronological approach to Alexander's incredible career.  He also felt he'd asked Farrell to play Alexander perhaps with more emotion than, in hindsight, he should.  Both comments made it clear that this film will be a ""Director's Cut,"" different in many ways from the theatre version, and I look forward to it highly.  I think some of the tactical problems of the film script will be resolved in the DVD, which should make it even more interesting.

In short, this is a film that it's easy to criticize without knowing anything about Alexander or his world, but I salute Stone for trying to tackle some of the greatest ambiguities and tensions of the story.  Historically, it's probably the most accurate film I've ever seen (unlike GLADIATOR, which had most of us loving the movie but chortling at the multiple errors of history it represented).  From the historically-accurate ancient clothing and warfare, to over-the-top (and historical!) visions of Alexander's mother and her bedrooms full of snakes, the film is classic Stone - extreme, exciting, occasionally tottering into ludicrousness, but (for anyone interested in ancient history) an amazing three-dimensional, flawed, fascinating spectacle. Its passion is so much greater than that of a film like TROY, just as its weaknesses are more evident. Stone's reach exceeds his grasp, but you'll have a fascinating time watching him try.

If people have different thoughts of the movie just because they did not understand the meaning of it, and they just go by the controversial topic which was his sexuality... that's one thing, a big thing actually but is not the main thing in the movie., because jet there I think that it has nothing to do with what the movie is talking about or what the writter want to let us know, see and feel from this Film...

2310656,2,B0009PLLN6,"The life and triumphs of Alexander the Great, the spiritual son of Achilles are superbly expressed in the screen through the storytelling of the one million carats actor Anthony Hopkins.

The stage is simply overwhelming, This epic saga needed somehow this vital component. The battle sequences in the desert against Dario troops are first class and so the last fight in India where the frozen image must have been recognized by Akira Kurosawa wherever he is. The splendid images in red after Alexander being wounded was another hit to remark. The most disgusting failure of the fil is the obsessive tendence of the scripters to remind the sexual inclinations of Alexander and not about his trascencence as conqueror and epic spirit man; that would suppose for instance to denigrate about the genius of Michelangelo due his sexual inclinations, leaving outside the gretaness of his legacy.

Two additional details affect seriously the movie as a whole. In the first half there is an excessive use of close-ups. In my modest opinion the close up is like rubato in music: just what you need to emphasize dramatic nucleus or remark the dramatis personae. The second is the presence of Rosario Dawson. To my mind she doesn't represent the Asiatic stereotype ; in the other hand she didn't live the role: too cold and inexpressive.

The rest of the cast was really interesting. The highlights performances are for Angelina Jolie who gives a perfect portrait of Olympia; she exploited her erotic face but also revealed the absolute domain of the body language: the expressive eyes delineated her speech. Jared Leto made a wonderful portrait and finally Val Killmer as Filipo was memorable too.

Edition, photography and artistic direction are outstanding. And please realize the awful homage to Kurosawa' s Kagemusha when Bucefalo falls seriously wounded.",1119139200,,1849,5.112582781456954

Its big problem was that it ran out of time to tell the last part of the story and thus seemed uneven and boring. With this one, Oliver Stone managed to make that 1950s movie look good and not so boring. The battles are all wrong, even the choice of which to leave out, and only Anthony Hopkins gave me hope at times that it would not be so bad. I was embarassed for my sons and everyone (not many people) at the theater found it dissapointing, to say the least. I do not say don't watch it. Do so; you won't believe me if you do not.

2310659,3,B0009PLLN6,"Alexander is an historical drama so disconnected from actual history that by film's end I had the sensation of floating in the mossy dankness of Oliver Stone's bong water. Director Stone presents a highly inventive look at the life of America's first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.

Colin Farrell portrays Hamilton as a man haunted by visions of buggy crashes and spooky Native American rituals. Farrell competently captures the dichotomy of Hamilton, a man brilliant enough to write The Federalist Papers yet sophomoric enough to engage in drinking games with Samuel Adams (the two men are credited with inventing ""quarters,"" though they originally played it with the ha'penny).

Angelina Jolie sizzles as Maria Reynolds, the married woman whose affair with Hamilton triggered his eventual downfall. Interestingly, the tattoo on the small of her back, visible during lovemaking scenes, might have come across as an anachronistic distraction, but Maria explains it away as a youthful indiscretion during the Whisky Rebellion of 1794.

Val Kilmer is in typically campy form as Hamilton's friend-turned-rival Aaron Burr. After winning the famous duel, Burr stands over the prostrate Hamilton and taunts, ""Not a bad duel, Hamilton. You came in second place.""

Anthony Hopkins gives a phoned-in performance as the wizened Benjamin Franklin (actually, the acting is flat enough to have spewed from the fax machine). Stone must have told Hopkins to play Franklin as a Colonial-era Yoda, how else to explain Sir Anthony's goofy syntax as he drones, ""Strong is Jefferson. Mind what you have learned. My kite this is.""

Ultimately, Alexander is a missed opportunity, a chance to show the gestation of American monetary policy aborted by a director obsessed with his own kaleidoscopic view of reality.",1118620800,7,1807,5.348591549295775

2310662,2,B0009PLLN6,"come on now guys..we all saw the movie last year and we all say 2 different things ""IT SUX"" or ""ITS SO GOOD"" but to be honest its a blend of SUX and TOTAL DISASTER...u know the best thing the movie offered was the narration by Anthony Hopkins

So lets get down to the movie:Collin Farrel who is suppose to portray the most famous military leader of antiquity, did a poor job at portraying such a man. Not to mention how much homosexual interaction was between Alexander and Hephaestion. It isn't that it bothers me but when its going on throughout most of the time it feels like i paid to watch a movie where 2 men keep hugging. Now the battle scenes had to be explained by Anthony Hopkins who also played Ptolemy. It got irritating that he's talking even while they're fighting, so you're sidetracked by what's being said and what's even going on. In summary,the war scenes were not as epic as one may have thought while seeing previews of this movie.

Angelina Jolie as Olympias(Alexander's mother). Now one thing the writers got right: Olympias is supposed to be a manipulative woman and selfish, though she claims it was for Alexander's good. Its'a huge set back that they have Jolie playing this character because the make up on her looked ridiculous it only made her look like she hadn't slept and didn't make her look like she was a mature,older woman. Olympias i imagine would look like a woman of power with a more provocative look that quite frankly dind't suit Jolie. Her accent was terrible and not the accent u might hear out of a Macedonian woman,more like an accent of a Russian woman (no offense to the Russians).

Philip II: Philip is Alexander's father and also was king of Macedonia before his son took the throne. Val Kilmer is not convincing and his short time on the screen was spent with viewers seeing him as a womanizer and a drunkard but also a man who had much hate for his wife Olympias. They made him look so old that even Kilmer couldn't see through all that make up. Kilmer played a rather weak Philip when history shows a more strong military genius.

I'm not going to say more on the other characters because it's plain to see here that the movie wasn't quite an epic as much as it was a disaster. It didn't show Alexander's greatness or his strength or his genius, though Oliver Stone caught Alexander's homosexual tendencies rather well, the movie was a blend of bad make up, bad dialogue, okay sets, and the acting was to puke for. Battle scenes i was hoping would be more ""epic"" in nature but Hollywood has never done a good job at filming such action. Even if you see the 1956 release of ""Alexander the Great"" with Richard Burton, it is still the same although with less sexual language or interaction.",1118448000,,2740,4.518145161290323

I'm a fan of Colin, Jolie & Hopkins so I decided that Alexander, although bashed by every critic, would still be worth my time.  I'm sad to say I was wrong.  I feel that Oliver should have focused of the greater aspects of Alexanders life, like his rise to power, instead of throwing us into the middle of his reign and spending way too much time letting us know he would rather sleep with his friend (played way too femininely by Jared Leto) than his wife.  I felt the acting was lacking, all except Colin.  I felt he did very well.  I feel bad that he was bashed so much for this performance for I felt he was the only part of the movie that remained memerable.  I thought he deserved an oscar nod, although I would have chosen Johny Depp over Colin to walk away with the golden man.  The battle scenes were also very dissapointing.  First of all, you have a three hour movie about the most powerful warrior in the world and there are only about twenty minutes tops worth of battle time...thats just bad judgment on Oliver's part.  The battle scenes themselves were lacking.  The first against the Medes & Persians was a complete mess...the battle scenes in Troy were far superior as was the battle scene in the beginning of Gladiator.  The last scene with the Elephants was the most anticipated scene of the movie for me and it left me bitter.  It could have been sooooo much better.  I read that the battle scene was distroyed going through an x-ray and they were only able to salvage some of the battle, but still, it wouldn't have saved the movie from impending doom.  I don't feel I could watch it again.  The sex scene was steamy, in a funny, laugh out loud kinda way...

BUT, for those of you who know something about ancient Greece and Alexander, this movie was wonderful. What fun to see the taming of Bucephalus! And to see Aristotle teaching the boys that the world was a island, and that it was possible to see it all. Having seen that scene, I believed that Ferrell's Alexander was distraught when he found out that the Hindu Kush wasn't the end of the world, and he'd never conquer it all.

I loved the casting of Angelina Jolie; Olympias was a barbarian who made the Greeks uncomfortable with her snakes and potions, and this Olympias made me shudder too. Her relationship with Philip was well portrayed, especially since she convinced Alexander that he was the son of Zeus, who visited his mother in the guise of a snake.

I am sorry to hear that some dialogue between Alexander and Hephestion was cut out. The actors actually had a chance to ACT. Rather than rolling in the sheets or ignoring the relationship between the two men - as the sanitized version of ""Troy"" did for Achilles and Patroclos - I knew that there were true feelings betwwen those men, as there had been in recorded history. I comment Stone for allowing us that on screen.

I can only imagine what a viewer who did not know the history would make of this mess. It is practically incoherent. There are senseless flashbacks. Huge swathes of Alexander's life go unmentioned. Some of his most amazing achievements are covered in voice-over.  It's a travesty.

What should have been a vast, epic adventure turned out to be a movie about a guy and his mom.

Oh, and there's an invasion of Asia.

But while invading Asia, this guy works through his mom issues. Mom, who looks old enough to be the guy's sister, is constantly entangled with snakes and has a KGB accent. No wonder the guy invaded Asia to get away from her.

The Macedonians speak like Irish or Scots -- one supposes to emphasize their cultural backwardness. Nice touch, that. Unless you're Irish or Scottish.

The battle scenes are incomphrehensible nonsense. We haven't a clue what's going on, and labels like ""Macedonian left"" don't exactly clear things up. In one instance, Alexander (one of the world's greatest generals, remember) draws up his close-ordered infantry phalanx to face elephants for the first time. Where do you think he does this? Why, in the middle of a dense jungle, where else?  Why not pack your men together against the trees with about 50ft of clear sight in front of them. Then hope for the best.

2310670,5,B0009PLLN6,"So many viewers and critics seem to be judging Alexander the film because of human flaws in the man Alexander, not because the movie has any flaws - it was perfect. Alexander was so intensely  absorbing, a truly great story to watch, that none of the negative or flaws seen by critics and so many negative-minded moviegoers was visible. I don't watch films to criticize them. All of you are flawed, admit it. But Alexander and the film are truly great! Look for the positive in this film and you will learn to be happy in spite of yourself, i.e. your own failures - failure teaches many lessons. Ptolemy made a point of Alexander's Towering Failure over other men's successes. You could even have a good many laughs if you didn't take yourselves so seriously. Alexander is not some 9-5 endless treadmill job, boring life, but Alexander was an adventurer, ever-seeking new worlds to conquer and to change for the better.
  The Theatrical and Director's Cut are in my collection. There are scenes in both versions that are cut out of both. Theatrical shows more of Alexander's relationship to Hephaistion, while the Director's gives more on his hot & steamy first night with his new tribal hill wife Roxanna. The order of scenes is switched around from one version to the other. I wish that the studio would put all of the cut scenes into one colossal DVD of this fine historical yet very well acted film. (And so my wish was granted after writing this review when Oliver made the Theatrical and Director's Cut, with deleted scenes added, into his Alexander Revisited - The Final Cut: totally superb, and of course is also in my collection of all three versions)
  Remember this: it is not fiction. It is truly a great and true-life Greek tragedy of the highest order that still affects our modern life because of the spread of pure classical ancient Greek culture that underlies modern societies, with Greek, that I studied in college, as a root language in both the East & the West. (I was privileged to stay in Athens, Greece for 5 weeks and to stand beneath the Acropolis mount of temples above the Agora.)
""Alexander"" also gives a picture of the difficulties and beauties of family life and interpersonal relationships, religion and politics, and lessons of history, i.e. from Aristotle, that still exists today. You can enjoy many precious moments in Alexander. It is intense and hits you down deep in your heart. The emotions portrayed are multitudinous and paint a colorful rainbow of personalities, motives, ambitions, and desire.
  What have you explored and gone where no man has gone before? What is your ultimate goal in life?!! Alexander's was to see beyond death's door, finally adventuring beyond the veil of the flesh. Alexander is not a shallow film for the mindless movie-goer. Hurrah for Oliver Stone, the magnificent!

8064773,4,B0009PLLN6,"This is a big time Hollywood history movie like they used to make. There are some really terrific scenes, especially the battle of Gaugamela which gives us a birdseye view of how massive this fight was. Alexander was outnumbered by the huge Persian army, but his military skills are on full display here. That scene alone is worth watching the movie.

Unfortunately there are parts of the movie that slow the pacing way down. Alexander conquered about 90 percent of the known world by the age of 32, but this movie develops a soap opera feel and leaves his military adventures behind. And that was a mistake. More examples of his actual military accomplishments would have been more interesting than his weird relationship with his mother.

The soundtrack by Vangelis works well, especially the battle music. It's unique and should hold up with time.

There are many reviewers who are clearly uncomfortable that Alexander was probably bisexual. It is a fact that his lifelong friend Hephaestion was his closest adviser, and when he died, Alexanders life collapsed. True, there are no cell phone pictures of Alexander and Hephaestion having sex, but let's be honest. Same sex relationships among the Greeks at that time was well known and not that big of a deal. The thought of Alexander being bisexual should not distract from the reality that he was one of the greatest military leaders of all time.

Putting aside the awful blond wig and a silly accent, Colin Farrell does a commendable job in the lead. Alexander was not just a conqueror and lover, but someone who valued culture and history. Farrell is believable in the role.
