1658805,4,B00005T336,"Tough Tape 2 is just what it says ... tough, at least for intermediate exercisers like myself!
Although other reviewers have noted that this tape is choppy, I really didn't notice that ... I was too busy focusing on the workout itself.  It is a tad bit fast paced for me, and I did end up hitting the pause button on a few occasions, but I believe that time and repetition with ""cure"" that.  I do recommend having all of the necessary equipment near by!
This is a well-rounded tape that sculpts all major muscle groups, as well as some you might not have even known you had.  Wonderful for sculpting your body for swimsuit weather!  (Used in conjunction with cardio tapes).
To do this workout, you will need a Fanny Lifter (can be purchased at 1-800-THE-FIRM), 3 to 15 pound dumbells (heavier for advanced), and I believe you need a dowel as well (can substitute a broom or mop handle if you wish).
Not recommended for someone who is brand new to exercise.",984700800,2,956,4.477011494252873

7953315,4,B00005T336,"This is one of the old Firm tapes made from clips of older Firm workouts. This is the workout that introduced me to the ""Firm"" and it is tough! That being said if you stick with this workout you will see results in 10 workouts or less as stated on the box. The older Firm tapes are pretty good. If you are very overweight or outta shape YOU MAY NOT WANT TO START HERE.",1306281600,,368,3.9864864864864864
7953316,5,B00005T336,"I have been using this workout exclusively for the past 3 weeks and it has been kicking my butt.  I have the DVD version which also includes the 'Total Abs' workout as well, so if you're looking for an all-in-one package, get the DVD.  As another has said - start out slow and have the remote control handy to pause the workout when you need to - it's tough.

The only retractors I have for this workout is a couple of the instructors sound like psychotic b* and some of the music is a bit cheesy (I was actually thinking of just cranking some heavier music once I get the workout memorized - problem solved.

This workout will shape the following (main emphasis):

Butt
Quadriceps (front of leg)
Hamstrings (back of leg)
Lats (mid back)
Shoulders (front, mid, and posterior)
Biceps

This workout will hit the following (less emphasis):

Lumbar
Adductors (inner thigh)
Abductors (outer thigh)

If you work at an office job and sit in a chair all day, your hips will tend to get 'compacted' over time - not good.  This workout may help to some extent for compacted hips, because there are MANY exercises in this video which relieve the stress and tightness from such a condition.

For 45 minutes, it packs in a great balance of cardio, resistance, and stretching.

Get the DVD, start slow (without weights) then challenge yourself continually with increasing weight.  You will not be dissappointed.",1273536000,,1397,4.703703703703703
7953317,4,B00005T336,"Full-body muscle toning, with limited cardio. You WILL get your heartrate up, but I thought the whole selling point of The Firm was that mix of muscle shaping & cardio. Also not much for the abs. The benefit of this video is that it's only 45 minutes, a quickie compared to most FIRM videos, plus the leg toning is the best of pretty much any exercise video series on the market. Worth having in your workout library.",1189728000,3,417,4.428571428571429
7953318,4,B00005T336,"This is another ""Firm Parts"" video, compiled from Firm Strength, Firm Cardio, Maximum Body Shaping, Fat Blaster and Better Body and Buns. It runs about 45 minutes and is very thorough in hitting all the muscle groups, although there are no abs. But it is short enough that you can tack on a brief ab session following as I often do. You will need a tall box and assorted dumbells for this routine.

You start with a fun warmup from Better Body & Buns then moving into the stretch from the same video. A dowel is used for this segment but a body bar or broom or mop handle will do. Then you start out with 2 sets of squats and pushups from Firm Cardio. The next section is from Maximum Body Shaping, dips with kicks using a dowel and optional dumbell for counterbalance and squats with military presses. There are 2 sets each, the squats and military presses are short sets so one could ""heavy up"" if they choose to. Next is an upper body set from Better Body and Buns with plyo jumps. You will do plyos first, then move into military presses, french presses and bicep curls, then you will finish this segment with more plyo jumps. Then from Firm Strength you will do a set of lunges and dips, first lunging on the right leg and dipping with the left leg working the right leg, then you will do a set of squats before lunges and dips on the left leg, lunging with the left leg and dipping with the right. Next is more upper body work from Maximum Body Shaping, one arm rows on the left side, you will do 16 reps then you will do biceps curls with the same arm, these are ""cheat reps"" where you assist on the positive and resist on the negative.

We are about halfway through the workout, now it's time for leg presses from Firm Cardio, you will work the left leg first, you will do one set of 15 reps and then do a set of french presses allowing you to catch your breath, then you will do one more set of leg presses again on the left leg. I like how they do this as I often need to get some air after leg presses.  Next are tall box climbs from Maximum Body Shaping which can be tough after just completing all those leg presses. Following those you will do a set of one arm rows on the right side, then the bicep curls with the ""cheat"" on the right arm. After this you will do more leg presses from Firm Cardio, this time you will work the right leg, you will do one set of 15 reps, then you will do a set of bicep curls, then do your final set of leg presses. Next is a tough shoulder segment from Firm Strength. You start with side deltoid raises seated, then you will stand and do front deltoid raises, I usually stay seated though. Then you will pick up heavier weights, and do overhead presses once again seated. This segment can be really tough but you will feel good once you finish it, I know I do.

We are on the home stretch now, time for more one arm rows and rear leg extensions, preceded by some brief hamstring work which is all from Better Body and Buns. You will do the right side first then immediately go into the other side. Following this you will do a set of plie squats, with some tempo variations and glute pinches to make a just a little more intense. More shoulder work follows from Firm Strength, side deltoid raises then you will work the rear deltoids in a standing position. A set of tough tricep dips completes this segment. They perform these using a 2 x 4 and feet up on the tall box which seems to be tough, but I just use my tall box with hands on it and feet on the floor as I do not have 2 x 4's laying around, and it works just fine. Finally you will do some pushups and spinal erector work from Fat Blaster, this is the only segment taken from that video. Then it's time to stretch out, the cooldown/stretch from Better Body and Buns is used.

This is one of my favorite Firm videos, and I have quite a variety from the classics to the present era Firms. I give it 4 stars only because there are no abs, otherwise it's great. It is short and hits almost everything. Some might not like the constant change of instructors but this does not bother me at all. I also think the routine flows nicely. Recommended.",1110067200,2,4147,4.19172932330827
7953319,5,B00005T336,"TT2 was one of my very first FIRM workouts.  This tape, along with good nutrition, has really helped my body to become toned and slim.  I now have an extensive collection of workout videos, yet I reach for this one time and time again.  I use it on days  when I am pressed for time yet want to feel as if I had a good, effective, total body workout (minus abs).  The varying segments taught by different instructors, including Traci Long, flow together well.  I prefer the older FIRM videos such as this one rather than the more recent.  They are fun and exciting to do!  I would not recommend this tape to a beginner unless perhaps you try it with no or very light weights.  It begins with a warm up, followed by strength, then a cool down.  Throughout the strength training, your heart rate will be kept up, increasing your metabolic rate.  At first you may need to pause the tape a few times to catch your breath, especially if you are new to working out. You will need lighter and heavier dumbells, a tall step, and a dowel (I use a mop). I usually follow this workout with a segment off the FIRM's 5 day Abs.",1086048000,6,1113,4.277511961722488
7953320,4,B00005T336,"Another of Firm's compilation tapes, this one has 45 minutes of toning toning toning.  Unlike other Firm workouts, there are no cardio sections, which I missed, since I use them to recover from the tough strength work.  That said, my heartrate was definitely in the target zone through about 30 minutes of this tape.
For intensity, this one is an intermediate/advanced tape, on par with Firm Strength or Firm Cardio, I think just below Total Body or Body Sculpting Basics.  The compilation flows nicely, and all your major muscles get a great workout, except for the abs.  I find myself adding a set from 5-Day Abs at the end and 10 minutes from some other cardio tape somewhere in the middle to round things out.",1052352000,2,713,4.68
7953321,4,B00005T336,"This tape was a good toning tape with a little cardio thrown in.  I didn't realize until after I purchased it that it was a complilation video; all of it were parts of other videos put together, which was a little disappointing.  But the workout itself was challenging and fun.  A great tape to have if you are only going to have a few FIRM tapes.",1027382400,2,347,4.2272727272727275
7953322,4,B00005T336,"This tape was my first Firm exercise video and I doubt it will be my last.  I have a variety of exercise videos and got this tape to add more toning and cardio work during a single session.  This tape won't let you down.  I usually wear a heart rate monitor and my heart continues to stay in the high end, around 80%.  That's exactly what I was looking for in a tape for those days when I want to combine both.  It runs about 45 minutes long of actual exercise and is a collage of other previous tapes.  The editing was well done and whiie it works the total body it kicks butt on your legs.
Every leg exercise possible is in this video tape which makes it extremely hard.  Unless you are a hard core leg exerciser it will make a difference in your legs and glutes.  The thing I like about this tape is that whenever you feel like you are building up in a certain area and it's getting too easy just increase your weight.  Trust me... it will take quite sometime. I know because I use my heart rate as an indicator.
I had all this equipment at home because I use videos as my primary source of exercise.  You will need at least 2 sets of weights, 3 is better (light, moderate and heavy).  Specific weights are not given because everyone is different.  The standard for most women is 3,5 and 8 or 10 pounds but only you will know.  A dowel which is another term for any sort of stick that's about just below your breast bone and height and can be used for balance.  I picked up mine at the hard ware store for a few bucks but you could also cut off a mop or broom stick and that would do the trick just as well.  A 2x4 board or something to elevate your heels when doing some of the squat and tricep exercises.  Again don't get caught up with specifics, if you have a small phone book that would work too, just be creative.  Then there is the box!  It's 14"" high and something I don't use.  I have a rather high bed and use my step stool as my box.  It's only 12"" and I can only thank my lucky stars because I would have thrown this tape away had it been higher.  On days when I want to use this tape but my heart rate is running high I will use my step with one or two risers instead.  That works just fine.  In other words all you need is something to step up and step down on.  You can always adjust intensity with your hand weights.  I use a mat to do the pushups and lower back exercises even though I am on carpet.  It gives me a smooth surface and I don't have to worry about fibers getting in my face as I come down for a pushup.
I only rotate this tape in once a week and it's made a big difference in my physique and this is from someone that thought her legs were top notch.  My only complaint is that there could be more bicep work but that's a miniscule complaint.
If you want good overall toning while keeping a good fat burning cardio pace then this tape is for you.",1023321600,24,2880,4.024647887323944
