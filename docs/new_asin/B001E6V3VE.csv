8720536,5,B001E6V3VE,"An excellent documentary about the 5-year effort to produce the iconic ""The Dinner Party"" art installation.  It also provides insight into Judy Chicago's views on the feminist movement in the 1970's.  Highly recommended as there is nothing like it available.",1453248000,,258,5.425
