8413950,5,B000069HZB,One of Ulli Lommels best and weirdest movies. The transfer from the film print looks great!! A must for strange cinema fans.,1517702400,,124,4.681818181818182
8413951,1,B000069HZB,"""Revenge of the Stolen Stars"" is, according to the DVD box, ""a sexy and witty twist on the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' formula,"" and ""a tongue-in-cheek tribute to pulp adventures of yesteryear."" Of course the box also claims that the movie ""sparkles like a jewel"" and is ""a visually lustrous escapade."" You can judge for yourself the veracity of these claims, but they made me wonder if I had seen the same movie. The film is certainly derivative (which director Ulli Lommel discusses at some length in the extras,) but my copy came without sparkle, apparently.

The film was made in 1984 and all the stereotypes from that era's adventure movies are front and center. The film is heavily and very annoyingly narrated throughout and opens with a corpulent man under a parasol in a hot tub bloviating about the great adventure to come. It is a fitting opening to a truly awful epic. The film quickly traipses to the mystical Asian island of ""Sunanow"" where plantation owner Duncan McBride (Klaus Kinski) is having an argumentative game of chess with an untrustworthy business associate. The dialogue introduces the concept of the six-star rubies, the McBride plantation, and the family curse. Then Kinski and associate shoot and kill each other. Despite his being on the DVD cover, Kinski is dead in the first five minutes of the film although he does come back as a ghost a couple more times, for maybe five minutes total onscreen time. In his interview, Lommel discusses the day they shot Kinski's footage in Mexico, and details at length how difficult he was to work with, which obviously had some bearing on this.

With Duncan dead, the staff put his ashes in a small tureen guarded by the two most ludicrous mummies you have ever seen in a small anteroom off his bedroom. The McBride estate and ruby mine pass to his nerdy nephew Gene McBride (Barry Hickey,) who travels to Sunanow to take command. Gene meets the plantation hangers-on, secretary and obvious love interest Kelly Scanlon (Suzanna Love,) comic book bad guy Max Stern (Ulli Lommel,) and a variety of other oddballs. The staff plans to control meek Gene, and his first day there doesn't go so well. After a very traumatic shower sequence, Alfred the creepy butler offers Gene the evening menu: ""For dinner this evening we have fried rat, roast bat, and poached water buffalo tongue."" Gene retreats to bed in Uncle Duncan's room where he is ensconced in mosquito netting and almost strangled to death by a vine of what appeared to be Eurasian milfoil. I could be wrong, I'm not a botanist. That the leaves of the bogus strangling vine were the most interesting thing onscreen should tell you all you need to know.

Add to the unpleasant night a visit from wacky Uncle Duncan's ghost and Gene wants to leave. Kelly dissuades him and they see about getting the curse lifted by conferring with a local tribal leader. They must reunite the three six-star rubies and return them to the tribe or pretty much everybody's doomed. This sends Gene and Kelly on some side trips, the first of which is to Bangkok, where love blooms for the couple. (Of course.) For a complicated reason they need to go to the Singapore Bar, which is, as it turns out, a ""gentleman's club."" This results in no end of hilarity as Kelly dresses like a male hayseed and laughter ensues, or at least it was supposed to. Following Kelly are another plot-distracting couple, Alex (Andy Lyon) and Lupe (Kitty O'Shea....really? A character named ""Lupe"" being played by an actress named ""Kitty O'Shea?"") These two serve no particular purpose that I could tell other than to pad the running time and eventually force the ridiculously contrived conclusion. The Singapore Bar scene is perhaps the most odious in the film, but after some recreation and a jealous lover's spat, they do get the first of the three rubies.

The next stop on the tour of places I never want to see again takes them to an Asian warlord's home. He wears the ruby in his turban. To further the plot along, what does Lommel do? He turns Gene into a monkey and Kelly into a piglet. Hilarity ensues (or not) as a goat and boa constrictor join the cast. In the process there's a Three Stooges caliber fight, with Gene grabbing the turban unnoticed (right...) after he changes back into a man. Sadly, Kelly remains a pig. He uses a magic wish he was granted to change her back into a woman, but she still squeals like a pig. Although the squealing is no more insipid than the rest of her dialogue, Kelly quickly remembers how to speak, just in time for them to return to the estate and find Alfred beheaded by a ceiling fan. The film reaches resolution with a supernatural battle of good and evil, and Gene and Kelly running off to San Francisco. After pausing there for a minute they head to Colorado Springs and Acapulco, all the while being chased by Alex and Lupe. Ultimately, they agree to be partners in an emerald smuggling ring in Brazil, and as they fly into the sunset (literally) the credits roll.

The DVD extras include a retrospective interview with writer-director Ulli Lommel which made me have a bit more sympathy for him than I did watching this monstrosity. Lommel was forced into doing this film as part of a three picture deal, and he recalls many of the tribulations in bringing it to the screen. According to Lommel, Kinski was a drunken nightmare to work with and let his ego run wild in the day they filmed his part. They were also extorted while in Mexico and then moved filming to the Philippines. Additional filming was done in Malibu, San Francisco, and Colorado Springs. From what I gathered from the interview Lommel picked the locations because they were places he wanted to go. I couldn't otherwise imagine wasting the money for the location work on such a putrid movie.

This is truly one of the worst films in the 1980's adventure genre, and there is blame to spread everywhere. The script is ridiculous, the dialogue is stilted, the romance is wholly implausible, the acting is awful, and worst of all it's just plain boring. Do not be fooled with Klaus Kinski's preeminence on the box or billing; he has very little screen time, and when he is onscreen you will likely just be embarrassed for him. On a humorous note, please enjoy the misspelling of Kinski's name (i.e. Kinksi) on the back of the DVD box.

I can think of absolutely no reason to watch this movie.",1301184000,3,6391,4.6705150976909415
8413952,4,B000069HZB,"Revenge of the Stolen Stars is a wonderful, adventurous, sexy film - and very similar to'The Phantom' in it's plot. Klaus Kinski is magnificent as always, however he should have had more scenes. After briefly seeing him, the story continues with his suggestive, spooky presence without actually showing him. An awesome story nevertheless! And a terrific find for all of us Klaus Kinski fans out there!
