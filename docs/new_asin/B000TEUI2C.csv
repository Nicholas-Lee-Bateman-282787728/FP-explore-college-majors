8208729,4,B000TEUI2C,"The maker's description of the film gives the wrong impression. The house rented out for a party is only a small part of the plot. It's mostly about journalists struggling against the restricitons set on them by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's dark - but very good. Though really a minor part of the film, the party scene gives one a glimpse into the life of real young Iranians. The images of veiled women and gun-toting bearded men so prominent in Western media are here completely contradicted by scenes of young women in revealing party clothes and young men break-dancing to western music.",1219795200,3,597,4.75
