5135511,5,B0087IT86Y,"Alfred Hitchcock and Agatha Christie must be spinning in their graves that they didn't think of the idea for ""Bernie"" first. But ""Bernie"" is a true story, even featuring some of the townspeople of Carthage, Texas, who knew Bernie Tiede and his victim Marjorie Nugent. An assistant funeral director in Carthage, Bernie (Jack Black) is an infinitely kind, infinitely generous man who's the friend of everyone in town. But everyone in town is dumbfounded when Bernie manages to win the good opinion of Marjorie (Shirley MacLaine), a sour, bossy, but very wealthy harridan who doesn't have a good opinion of anyone except Marjorie.

Bernie quits his undertaker's job and becomes personal assistant to Marjorie, who disinherits her unloved and unlovable children in favor of Bernie. One day Marjorie stops showing up in town. Bernie tells the townspeople that Marjorie is ill and in a nursing home. No one cares about Marjorie, so no one checks up on her. Bernie continues to live his same frugal lifestyle, though the surprise gifts he's always loved to give people get bigger and more expensive. Ten months go by. Then the police show up at Marjorie's house and open the freezer in her garage...

Director Richard Linklater co-wrote the screenplay with Skip Hollandsworth, who wrote the Texas Monthly article on which the story is based. The film works brilliantly, not only as a true-crime story but as one of the most insightful depictions of small-town life ever put on screen. Some people might not cotton to the film's dry-as-the-Dust-Bowl sense of humor, but everyone will love Jack Black as Bernie, giving by far the best performance of his career. It's a performance that richly deserves an Oscar nomination, but it probably won't get one because the film wasn't a hit and was released too early in the year.

Black dominates the movie, but MacLaine skillfully underscores Marjorie's nastiness merely by the way she chews her re-fried beans, like a spiteful cow. Matthew McConaughey gives a live-wire performance as the prosecutor who brings Bernie to justice; it's a performance he's given before, but nobody does it better. Among the actors and non-actors in supporting roles, one of the funniest is Kay McConaughey, Matthew's mom.",1343520000,12,2238,5.059620596205962
5135512,5,B0087IT86Y,"What a great movie! This works on all levels -- plot, dialogue, characters, acting, directing.

From the beginning, when Jack Black drives and performs a gospel song along with the radio, the movie amuses, enthralls, horrifies, and entertains you.

Shirley McLaine shows she still has the chops after six decades in the industry. Even the maddening way she chews refried frijoles 25 times defines her character like no line of dialogue could ever do.

Matthew McConnaughey is spot-on perfect as the small town good old boy prosecutor. The way he asks, ""What kind of wine do you eat with fish?"" in front of the ""cousin county"" jurors is far more guilt inducing than any mere evidence would ever be.

Even the townsfolk, as themselves, paint a picture of East Texas like nobody's business. This film deserves to rank alongside ""This is Spinal Tap,"" and ""Best in Show.""

Five stars and two thumbs up!",1342915200,5,897,4.836601307189542
5135513,5,B0087IT86Y,"Bernie is the new masterpiece by Richard Linklater. The fact that he could turn such a difficult premise to such a successful black comedy/drama is remarkable. This may be one of the greatest works on small-town America in this decade. Though Bernie may not have the breadth of a work like Fargo, it does magic in how it tells its story.

Really, the most fascinating thing about Bernie is the way the story is told. Rather than give us a linear story, Bernie story is mostly retold by the residents of Carthage, TX who were witnessed to the gruesome events that occurred in this innocent town. This style can backfire gloriously if these characters are too animated, but Linklater strikes the right tone. With a Texan accent and some Southern innocence, these characters all suit the benefits the main story line. He seamlessly alternates between the world of the main characters and residents. This is very competent screenwriting as Linklater only uses his main characters when they are necessary, and allows the residents of Carthage to do the main storytelling. This is a welcome retreat from heavy-set narration of many Hollywood movies, especially some master filmmakers like Woody Allen.

The movie is amazing because it centers on a murder that is hard to condemn like a CSI episode and the intent not dissimilar to Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. What makes the crime difficult to assess is that most of what the audience knows from Bernie is from the residents of Carthage, TX. We do not know Bernie as well as they do, and have to assume that their judgments are sound and not simplistic or based on a faade generated by Bernie himself. The film has been the subject of controversy by the way it portrays the murder, but if it were completely accurate to the conditions of the crime, the audience would not have such ambiguous feelings about the crime committed. In that case, Bernie would become another lunatic who murdered an innocent. What Linklater does is much more than that.",1341446400,52,1997,4.83625730994152
5135514,5,B0087IT86Y,"Before Bernie,I have never been a fan of the over the top performances of Jack Black.  I would not have gone to see the movie had it not been a true story from my part of the country.  I highly suggest you do a little research before you see it.  Jack Black should win an Academy Award for his performance. Can't wait to get my dvd and watch it again!  Don't miss Bernie!",1341187200,16,371,4.041095890410959
5135515,5,B0087IT86Y,"A man in a small Texas town befriends an unfriendly woman whom he kills. The town is behind him, as he is so well-liked and was quite generous with her money. This movie features interviews with people who actually knew the participants, and these interviews are combined with excellent storytelling. Jack Black is terrific in his portrayal of a really nice and well-regarded man who did something no one expected of him. His victim was not well-liked by anyone, making her a very unsympathetic figure. This is a funny movie with interesting characters that will keep you laughing and entertained.",1340841600,4,597,4.98
5135516,5,B0087IT86Y,"A murder took place in a small town in Texas. Of course, the person who is popular and charming, Bernie would never come to the townspeople's minds as a crazed murderer. The investigation begins as well as the drama, and all the pieces to the puzzle point to Bernie. The suspect who would be the least suspicious to the town, and totally unexpected. Gruesome story, intense suspense, good mystery. Acting Performance Superb. Highly Recommended for all mystery and thriller lovers!",1340841600,5,480,5.0125
5135517,5,B0087IT86Y,"Definitely not what I had expected--but at the same time, Bernie fit the profile for a sociopath killer. In a lot of ways people (especially those from rural Texas, like myself), can identify with this movie; everything to the last detail is legit. The actors, with their real southern accents (that sometimes can sound TERRIBLY fake in a movie from an actor trying to portray a southern drawl), the overbearing presence of Christianity, the black and white morality...even down to the Big Red bottle sitting on DA Buck's table during the court trial. And even if you didn't grow up in Texas or the South, Bernie's sweet/borderline psychotic (perhaps justifiable) behavior will leave most people pondering: Is he really evil? Or did he only succumb to a moment of passionate rage towards an evil woman? And even then, one can only wonder about the gray areas of human compassion...how far do we extend our understanding towards someone we think we know? Must we always keep perspective as objective as possible??

Excellent film...I'm telling everyone I know about it!",1339891200,9,1068,5.0

This movie is very entertaining and keeps your undivided attention for the whole running time of the film. Jack Black deserves an award for his acting in this film!! I love the gospel music played and sung throughout the film. I am a gospel music performer myself and knew every song!! Even though it was about a murder, it was a feel good movie!

5135519,5,B0087IT86Y,"This is a great movie!  We (people who know Bernie and or lived in Carthage) thought that there was no way that a movie could be made about a murder and be funny....But with the cast and the bizarre ""this can't be true"" storyline, it blew me away.  I am going to see it in Carthage on Sunday with my mom and her sister, my aunt, who is in the movie.  If you are a Jack Black fan...then this is a ""must see"".",1338508800,59,407,3.8795180722891565
5135520,4,B0087IT86Y,"Let me state upfront that I knew literally next to nothing about the movie's plot when I went to see it recently at my indie-movie theatre here in Cincinnati. I had heard good things about it, and that was good enough for me to check it out. Well, I was in for quite a surprise.

""Bernie"" (95 min.) brings the story of Bernie Tiede (played by Jack Black) as a funeral director (excuse me, ""assistant"" funeral director) in Carthage, TX. Bernie is the most likeable guy you'll ever meet. He is involved in the community like no-one else before, and the small town just things the world of him. At one of the funerals, Bernie meets widow Marjorie Nugent (played by Shirley McLaine), and they strike a friendship. Marjorie is viewed by everyone as a b*tch, but the two of them get along just great. Things take a turn for the worse as Marjorie becomes more and more possesive of Bernie, and it all builds up to a confrontation between the two, and Bernie shoots her. I won't tell more of the plot, so that you can experience for yourself what happens after that. Several comments: I didn't realize until the credits rolled that (i) this is based on true mid-90s events in Carthage, and (ii) the movie intersects with interviews from people from Carthage, which it turned out are not actors but the actual folks from Chartage who witnessed the whole thing.

I must mention the excellent work from Jack Black as Bernie (has he ever been better than in this movie?), but even more so the eye-popping performance by Shirley McLaine as Marjorie, which really blew me away. Matthew McConaughey certainly deserves an honorable mention in his role as the local District Attorney, MILES away from his usual stuff. In all, I cannot emphasize enough how pleasantly surprised I was by this movie, it just flashed by in no time, and kept my interest throughout. ""Bernie"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1338422400,123,1876,4.664652567975831

5135565,5,B0087IT86Y,"(Rounded up from 4-1/2 stars, Minor Spoilers) I may be a little partisan since I'm from Texas, but I very much enjoyed this little film, based on a true east-Texas story about an assistant funeral director (Jack Black) befriending an elderly widow...well, as much as one can enjoy a film about a true-life crime.  Pre-production, Black (""School of Rock,"" ""King Kong"" remake, etc.), our ""Bernie"" here, had quite a daunting and challenging task ahead of him in ""Bernie.""  His character was expected to sing well, play slightly effeminate, use an east Texas accent, and be subtly conniving, all while maintaining a comforting and lovable persona.  And, perhaps surprising some, Black passes the test with flying colors!  Where was his Oscar nomination, darn it?  I mean, who knew Black could sing convincingly well (doing his own singing) and play against type like a champ?  Another one of the film's many strengths is the townspeople's down-to-earth, snappy, knee-slapping dialogue as they narrate their respective sides of the story, sprinkled throughout the film, especially actor Sonny Davis (who you may remember as the demanding customer on ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" who wanted a refund on his ""under-cooked"" breakfast), funny all the way through to the end of the credits (don't walk away or stop it too early when the credits start to roll).  Oh yes, there's also the ever-capable Shirley MacLaine (Best Actress winner for 1983's Terms of Endearment) and a game Matthew McConaughey as the local sheriff.  It's such a shame this little film was lost in the Hollywood shuffle because it's quite a find, indeed.  [As an aside, my hometown, Temple, Texas, is mentioned in the movie, but the producers/research people made a little mistake; it is correct as Scott and White Hospital/Nursing Home, not ""Scott White"" as the Bernie character says in the movie.

5135596,5,B0087IT86Y,"Review of ""Bernie""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Bernie is one of my favorite movies, and the best advice I can give is this: Dont watch the preview. The preview gives away the entire storymajor spoilers! All you need to know is its about a very charismatic mortician who moves to a small Texas town and bonds with a widow after conducting her husbands funeral. If you start to read anything more about the plot, stop reading! The movie is so fantastic, but you can only see it for the first time once. Dont spoil it.

The acting in Bernie is incredible. I don't know what kind of anti-aging pill Shirley MacLaine is taking, but I want it! She looks fantastic, and her energy level is just as high as it was in her twenties. Matthew McConaughey gives a hilarious performance, and even people who normally cant stand him will think he does an excellent job (just ask my mom!). And Jack Black, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for his turn in the title role, is phenomenal. The Academy Awards snubbed him, big time. He pours himself into the role, making Bernie human, charming, troubled, sweet, and endearing.

Richard Linklater co-wrote and directed the film, and he guides the story with a very gentle hand. The main plot is spliced in with mock interviews, but Linklater doesnt make it feel like a documentary. He balances the very fine line between humor and drama, and unfolds the story to the audience in a truly perfect way.

Do me and yourself a favor; buy Bernie. Its a movie youll want to watch over and over and over.",1498435200,,1532,4.5
