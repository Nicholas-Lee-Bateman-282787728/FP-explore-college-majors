7922481,3,B00004TGFW,"This follows the Michael Palin presentation formula. I think as he has gotten a bit ruder in his old age.  Still he looks for the little boy bits on a couch.

The presentation is split into three parts as he follows Hemmingway's trail across the world. We get plenty of small details as Palin tries to do Hemmingway type stuff.

In the in there is a Hemingway overload. If you do not know his writing before the presentation you will not get it here.

Still you get to tour Hemingway's old haunts:
Chicago
Malan
Pamplona
Key West
Uganda
Etc.

I would say this presentation is best taken in small doses.",1401926400,,602,4.4363636363636365
7922482,3,B00004TGFW,"Having viewed most, if not all, of Michael Palin's adventures, this one is a trip down a well-traveled memory lane.  Mr. Palin's fresh and unbiased approach to showing us today's Cuba is a welcome relief from the usual tripe fed us by our media.  He presented a Cuba trying to forget the old and irrelevant Hemingway's Cuba; one copying with the challenges presented by the US economic blockade and forging a better future for its people---and along the way showing some interesting tidbits. Mil gracias Senor Palin.

7922483,4,B00004TGFW,"The following review is based on watching the DVD version of Michael Palin's ""Hemingway Adventure"", subtitled ""On the trail of an American legend"". This version consists of a single DVD disc with four programs totaling approx. 3 hours 15 minutes. There is no extra material, but English subtitles can be turned on or off, although I found the on/off setting to be counter-intuitive.

This ""Hemingway Adventure"" is a set of TV programs originally made for the BBC in 1999. Michael Palin visits many of the places where Ernest Hemingway lived and traveled, displaying a keen interest in Hemingway, mostly as a person rather than Hemingway's authorship.

Program 1:
Spain - running with bulls, bullfighting
Africa - hunting

Program 2:
Chicago - Hemingway's youth, guns, hunting, fishing, Indians
Italy - WW I
Paris - books, sports, injuries

Program 3:
Key West - Hemingway look-alikes, boxing
Africa again - plane crashes
Italy again - duck hunting

Program 4:
Cuba - drinking, fishing
Montana & Idaho - dude ranches, hunting, Hemingway's death

I don't understand this ordering of the programs, as it would make more sense if programs 1 and 2 were reversed. Then the programs would follow Hemingway's life fairly closely instead of appearing to be in almost random order.

As usual with Michael Palin's travelogues, the strong points are the very interesting places he visits and the very interesting people he manages to talk to. And the beautiful photography of the nature and cities and people and wildlife are very good.

I've also read the book that is associated with this TV program, and was disappointed to discover that many of the interesting things featured in the book are not even mentioned in the TV program. Of course, a book that runs 6 hours as an audio book obviously contains a lot more than a 3-hour TV program. (The book is highly recommended, both the printed version with beautiful photographs by Basil Pao and the audio version read by Michael Palin himself.)

This is a very good travelogue, the only negative aspect being that Michael Palin occasionally acts a bit too silly. Highly recommended.

7922484,3,B00004TGFW,"I have enjoyed Michael Palin's work for many years, from the time he was a member of Monty Python to his wonderful travel programs.
With this new program, ""Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure,"" despite many interesting moments I think he has produced one of the most unfocused television programs I have seen.  I think it would have been more coherent if Mr. Palin had begun his program at the start of Hemingway's life, namely Oak Park, Illinois, and gone on in chronological order instead of starting in Spain and visiting places haphazardly.
I found Mr. Palin's hunting expedition in part two to be ridiculous and bizarre.  To his credit, hunting certainly does not seem to be in Mr. Palin's nature.  The segment in which he went shooting will always remain with me as an example of the inane quality of hunting.  It seemed that Mr. Palin was obliged to shoot at anything that moved, be it a rabbit or a pheasant.  Was this supposed to prove that Mr. Palin could hit something? It seems to me that Palin is trying to live up to some ideal, image of Hemingway and has some difficulty rationalizing the less ideal parts of his life.  Good old Papa, and that sort of thing.
I was disappointed enough in this series, having seen only half, to forgo the rest.  ....",970531200,,1263,4.611607142857143
7922485,5,B00004TGFW,"Michael Palin to me makes travel so enjoyable.  This two part series is one I highly recommend for everyone to see. This was a new challenge for  Michael and he does an excellent job. The videos are a look into the life  of Ernest ""Papa"" Heminway and the places he lived.  What makes it  fun is how Michael tries to emmulate Heminway by trying some of his hobbies  which are hunting and fishing.  Of course, I can't forget Michael's great  sense of humor which is what I love most.  I feel like I have traveled with  Michael to all these places which include Spain, France, Italy,and Key  West.  I loved the feature on my hometown of Chicago.  Again, even if you  have never read Hemingway like myself you will enjoy this two part series.",965260800,,738,4.41044776119403
