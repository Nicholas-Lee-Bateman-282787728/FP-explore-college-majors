8452024,3,B0050WM5FG,"1953's The Mississippi Gambler is a rather splendid romantic drama that sees Tyrone Power's expert fencer take up life as a riverboat gambler with a unique gimmick - he plays an honest game. Teaming up with John McIntire's grifter and blessed with a sharp eye for other players' tells and card sharps' tricks, he soon incurs the enmity of spoiled rich boy John Baer and, by proxy, his sister Piper Laurie, with whom he naturally falls in love. His growing success and friendship with their noble and chivalrous father Paul Kavanagh only aggravates the feud, while his tendency to inadvertently be the cause of the destruction of everything she loves constantly keeps Laurie at arm's length while Julie Adams falls hopelessly in unrequited love with him on the sidelines. If it never adds up to much more than glossy romantic melodrama, it's still thoroughly enjoyable stuff, allowing Universal to get more use out of the riverboat they built for the box-office flop James Whale version of Show Boat that led to the studio changing hands back in the 30s (that riverboat would also appear in a couple of Anthony Mann-James Stewart Westerns and still turn up in the 70s TV show Alias Smith and Jones - along with the odd bit of stock footage from the film - when it was a rotting hulk on the studio backlot). It's only slowed down by a tiresome voodoo ballet - no-one looks good dancing with a chicken - but veteran screenwriter Seton I. Miller and director Rudolph Mate keep things moving along more than entertainingly enough elsewhere while the sharp eyed can spot legendary fencing master Fred Cavens and Anita Ekberg in blink-and-you'll-miss-them bit parts.

It's just a shame that Universal's Spanish DVD is such a poor print: it looks like a standards conversion from an NTSC videotape, soft in the daytime scenes and too dark in the night time ones with unremoveable Spanish subtitles translating the odd background river song in places.",1361404800,5,1942,4.867069486404834

8452026,5,B0050WM5FG,"The Mississippi Gambler is directed by Rudolph Mat and written by Seton I. Miller. It stars Tyrone Power, Piper Laurie, Julie Adams, John Mcintire, Paul Cavanagh, John Baer and Ron Randell. A Technicolor production out of Universal Pictures, the cinematography is by Irving Glassberg and music scored by Frank Skinner.

Mark Fallon (Power) is an ace and honest card player who earns his crust gambling on the river boats. Along with Kansas John Polly (McIntire), he aims to bring honest gambling to the card playing masses. When during one high stakes game he beats and embarrasses Laurent Dureau (Baer), it takes him to New Orleans where into his life comes danger, wealth, beautiful women, friendships and tragedy.

Sometimes horses and beautiful women are upset by whistles.

A forgotten film in the output of matine idol Tyrone Power, The Mississippi Gambler is a different kind of adventure to the type he was ultimately known for. Perhaps this is why it's still relatively obscure? That it isn't a swashbuckling tale of derring-do and testosterone fuelled bravado? As fun as his swordsman pictures are, and they are, it's a shame that the films such as this and Nightmare Alley, that contain some of his best performances, neither get the praise or exposure they deserve.

Mississippi Gambler finds Power getting his teeth into a role that can in many ways be seen as the ultimate male. Mark Fallon lives and breathes honesty and integrity, he is not only an ace card player, he's an expert swordsman, a gentleman, an excellent dancer, and of course, handsome into the bargain. What makes the film so intriguing and ever watchable, is that Fallon does everything correct as he lives his life, but pain, misery and tragedy surrounds him. The majority of people who come into contact with him invariably suffer in one form or another, marking Fallon out as a homme fatale type through no fault of his own, with the film being structured in such a way you just have to wait for the finale to see if your hopes will be fulfilled?

Entering into this one expecting a high velocity adventure will only lead to disappointment. There is action, quite a bit in fact, as we are treated to some fencing, old fashioned fist fights and a duel, while fans of card playing get a couple of high stakes battle of wills to gorge upon. But all these moments are just insertions into a character driven whole, a whole based on romance, passion and yearnings for the unobtainable. The lead characters are nicely drawn by Mat (D.O.A.) and Miller (The Adventures of Robin Hood/Here Comes Mr. Jordan), where the psychological make up and traits of the important individuals is there to absorb, ensuring the story is never dull, that it has a belief in what it will deliver come the end. The only real misstep is with Adams' character, Ann Conant, it's a thankless role and really needed some more flesh on her bones. But boy does Adams look stunning!

As a production the film also scores incredibly high. Bill Thomas' period costumes are feasts for the eyes, beautifully realised by Glassberg's (Bend of the River) Technicolor photography, and the back drop set decoration (Russell Gausman/Julia Heron) is fit to have graced a bigger budgeted epic in the same decade. Prolific music man Frank Skinner (Arabian Nights) scores it thematically reflective, while Gwen Verdon deserves a mention for her choreography, notably for the excitingly macabre Haitian Devil Song. On the acting front it's ineviatbly Power's show, but he is well supported by McIntire (crafty sidekick), Laurie (pulse raising lady axis) and Baer (snivelling spoiled fop). However, best of the support bunch is Cavanagh (Magnificent Obsession), he gives Edmond Dureau a regal quality, a bastion of moral codes, a hark back to when men were correct in manners and parental skills. The relationship between Fallon and Edmond is one of the film's true highlights, and that's because of Power and Cavanagh's performances.

A wonderful movie that's just crying out for a wide home format release, if you get the chance to catch it then grasp it with both hands. 8/10",1322870400,17,4112,4.916426512968299
8452027,4,B0050WM5FG,"On a riverboat trip down the Mississippi river, an honest gambler (Tyrone Power) runs afoul of a no good, spoiled scoundrel (John Baer) from a respected New Orleans family and his haughty Southern belle sister (Piper Laurie) with whom Power falls in love. His love and hate relationship with these two will bring tragedy to all of them. This entertaining piece of diversion directed by Rudolph Mate (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE) makes for a perfect lazy Sunday afternoon matinee (which is how I saw it). Movies like this don't hold up under much scrutiny but then again, they were never intended to. The handsome Power makes for a dashing riverboat gambler and Laurie looks ravishing in her Bill Thomas period costumes. Still, it's one of those films where the good girl (Julie Adams) has ten times the worth of the bratty one (Laurie) and one is frustrated when Power can't see it as Adams nobly and patiently stands by his side and waits. The lively score is by Frank Skinner (ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS). With Gwen Verdon (in black-face yet doing a voodoo dance with a chicken that would have PETA up in arms if made today), Anita Ekberg, John McIntire, Dennis Weaver, Ron Randell, William Reynolds, Guy Williams and Hugh Beaumont.

The Universal DVD from Spain utilizes a transfer that's on the soft side but still eminently watchable.",1306540800,7,1327,4.8201754385964914
