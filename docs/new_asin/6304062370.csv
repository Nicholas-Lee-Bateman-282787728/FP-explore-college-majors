8173162,4,6304062370,I would personally have to recommend this movie for any fan of mafia movies. The reason for this is because it has some decent acting with an unusal storyline when it concerns your average mafia tough guy on the run from the mob. I don't want to get into too many details as I'd hate to spoil the movie for you if you are planning to watch this. This is a straight to video release and in my own opinion I think if there was some more spice added to the film...Crosscut might've made it to the cinema.,1214784000,,501,4.122448979591836
