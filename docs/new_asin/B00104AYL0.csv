3045307,3,B00104AYL0,"""The Man Who Cheated Himself"" is a minor film noir that exemplifies the changing social mores as the United States enters the Eisenhower era. Police Lieutenant Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb) is an experienced detective with a hardened workaday attitude and a wealthy mistress, Lois Frazer. Lois (Jane Wyatt) is seeking a divorce from husband Howard (Harlan Warde). Convinced that Howard is out to kill her, Lois turns to Ed in a fit of panic. When Howard tries to rob his wife's home before leaving town, Lois shoots him, and Ed is left to cover up the crime. Ed is also in charge of the investigation into Howard's death, and his partner is none other than his younger brother Andy (John Dall), recently married, recently promoted, and eager to solve his first case.

""The Man Who Cheated Himself"" is true to its self-righteous title. It shames Ed Cullen for his bachelor lifestyle and scandalous taste in women. But these are two-dimensional characters in a pedestrian script. Jane Wyatt's performance is wooden.  Andy's earnestness is cloying. Lee J. Cobb is perfectly cast as the man who walks both sides of the law, but it's unfortunate that he's not given much to work with. This film is most valuable as an example of the sharp turn that even the pulpiest fiction took into the 1950s. Filmed in 1950, it showcases the post-war ideals of the nuclear family and middle class stability and conformity, in sharp contrast to the film noir of the 1940s.

The femme fatale, Lois, is not clever. She's stupid, hysterical, and always in need of a man. Not for money; she's rich. She's emotionally needy. If this were high noir, Ed and brother Andy might have been the same character. Now they are split into two: Andy's the good guy, the future of an optimistic nation -young, hardworking, honest, married, monogamous. Ed has avoided the settled life and has therefore become ensnared by a wicked woman who ruins his morals. It is no longer fashionable to consider that a good man might fall for a bad woman, so Ed and Andy must be two different people. Andy, the good guy, would never be enticed by Lois, the sort of woman who wears a satin evening gown around the house. But Ed, with his string of girlfriends and reluctance to conform, is ensnared.

There's not much to it. ""The Man Who Cheated Himself"" had no depth when it was made. But there are plenty of ideas to be mined if you compare it to the film noir of the 1940s. The American feminine and masculine ideals changed radically between 1950 and 1955, and that is preserved for posterity. 1950 is very early in the decade to see women so trivialized and married life so idealized. Though, in truth, there is a saccharine superficiality to Andy. It's interesting that the male protagonists of the 1950s were dressed more plainly and were much less angsty than in the 1940s, yet that did not always translate into greater masculinity. John Dall was a gay man who was often cast in roles that called for a lack of conventional masculinity. And here he is the post-war ideal. Hmmm.

The DVD (Alpha Home Entertainment 2008): This is a poor transfer of a poor print. It is often slightly fuzzy, out of focus. There are some scratches, and the picture is jumpy. Sound is crackly, not clean, but it is clear enough that it is only occasionally distracting. So it's watchable, but a better print would be appreciated. There are no subtitles or bonus features.

-Lee J. Cobb

-Jane Wyatt (is her acting always this bad?  And no, I don't by the ""she was trying to tell you about how fake she is"".
-The execution of the plot was a little boring
-The little brother (I really don't like his voice)

goes to the electric chair. Cobb's brother is made a detective and is also on the case and finds something funny going on between Cobb

Overall, I kinda liked the movie even after the hard for me to believe beginning.  :D

I began watching this and was feeling like I'd seen it before, but I hadn't. A few minutes in, I realized China Moon had done something similar to this. Mmm Ed Harris.

Lee J. Cobb is excellent as always. That man can do no wrong, I tell ya.
John Dall has an unfortunate face in that his expression always makes him look smug and smarmy. For me, every role I've seen him in is the same as his character in Rope, but that's my fault not his and I'm sorry to John Dall.
Jane Wyatt overacting and hard to take. However, she went on to become perfect as Margaret ""Oh, Buuuuud, could you come here a minute?""",1378771200,2,892,4.2976190476190474

3045360,3,B00104AYL0,"This movie was a bit of a surprise in a late night showing.  The foundation doesn't make much sense, but once you get past it, the story moves along and kept me awake.  In the opening sequence, a couple is in the process of breaking up in the home of the wife.  Long before she became America's favorite mother in TV's ""Father Knows Best"" or Spock's mother in ""Star Trek"", lovely Jane Wyatt played Lois a rich self obsessed woman who apparently collected husbands as quickly as she discarded them.  It's hard to read between the lines sometimes in this period of censorship.  Even the hint of amoral behavior was frowned upon.

Anyway, Lois tosses her soon to be ex out.  He returns later through a back door and she shoots and kills him, thinking he was coming after her.  And get this; she does it in front of her newest boyfriend, Ed (Lee J. Cobb) who is a veteran on the police force!  What does Ed do? He and She attempt to cover it up.  Ed is then assigned to the case along with his new partner who has just been promoted and just happens to be his kid brother Andy (John Dall, ""Rope"").  Ed has a hard time concealing the truth as Andy is pretty good at this detective business.

Although I kept asking myself why she would even get any jail time under the circumstances, the acting and the direction is strong enough to overcome the feeble premise.",1317340800,5,1356,4.3585657370517925

Cobb, and snarly beeee-otch Jane Wyatt combine to great effect in this beautifully shot film noir about the power that a fine piece of tart has over a small-minded man. Filmed in San Francisco to great effect. Our story: big and little brothers Cullen are police detectives in San Francisco. Big Bro (Cobb) has a dame habit, and how. His current paramour (Wyatt) has a ne'er do well hubby who is planning to off her for the money. One night honey and hubby meet and much to my surprise wifey does the shooting. Big bro sets little bro on the case and through twists and turns little bro clings tight to the case and it all ends badly but not for the poor widow! Oooo did I give it away?

John Dall is a terribly underrated actor. I love this film and his role in it. The three leads are all excellent, the story is genuinely engaging, with the brothers pitted against one another giving the whole thing a sad, tense edge. The city of SF looks fabulous and I wish you could still drive around it like that. And park everywhere you needed to. And have a nice studio apartment with glass ceilings.

In a Hitchcokian way, step by step, Cobb watches in horror how his brother ties the loose ends together, more and more pointing the guilt towards him.
As usually in film noirs of the time, improbable coincidences are necessary to render validity to the plot, but the screenwriters cleverly put all the necessary elements to show how the rookie cop uncovers the truth.
Wyatt is pretty but her acting is unconvincing until, perhaps, the very end, while Dall's character is a little too much of a boy scout to stomach, but Cobb is right on the mark.",1249948800,12,771,4.984496124031008

Stars: 3.5

Pros:
-Lee J. Cobb
-Plot is intersting enough
-Script has ok writing

Cons:
-Jane Wyatt (is her acting always this bad?  And no, I don't by the ""she was trying to tell you about how fake she is"".
-The execution of the plot was a little boring
-The little brother (I really don't like his voice)

I began watching this and was feeling like I'd seen it before, but I hadn't. A few minutes in, I realized China Moon had done something similar to this. Mmm Ed Harris.

Lee J. Cobb is excellent as always. That man can do no wrong, I tell ya.
John Dall has an unfortunate face in that his expression always makes him look smug and smarmy. For me, every role I've seen him in is the same as his character in Rope, but that's my fault not his and I'm sorry to John Dall.
Jane Wyatt overacting and hard to take. However, she went on to become perfect as Margaret ""Oh, Buuuuud, could you come here a minute?""",1378771200,2,892,4.2976190476190474

In the opening sequence, a couple is in the process of breaking up in the home of the wife.  Long before she became America's favorite mother in TV's ""Father Knows Best"" or Spock's mother in ""Star Trek"", lovely Jane Wyatt played Lois a rich self obsessed woman who apparently collected husbands as quickly as she discarded them.  It's hard to read between the lines sometimes in this period of censorship.  Even the hint of amoral behavior was frowned upon.

Anyway, Lois tosses her soon to be ex out.  He returns later through a back door and she shoots and kills him, thinking he was coming after her.  And get this; she does it in front of her newest boyfriend, Ed (Lee J. Cobb) who is a veteran on the police force!  What does Ed do? He and She attempt to cover it up.  Ed is then assigned to the case along with his new partner who has just been promoted and just happens to be his kid brother Andy (John Dall, ""Rope"").  Ed has a hard time concealing the truth as Andy is pretty good at this detective business.

Although I kept asking myself why she would even get any jail time under the circumstances, the acting and the direction is strong enough to overcome the feeble premise.",1317340800,5,1356,4.3585657370517925

Cobb, and snarly beeee-otch Jane Wyatt combine to great effect in this beautifully shot film noir about the power that a fine piece of tart has over a small-minded man. Filmed in San Francisco to great effect. Our story: big and little brothers Cullen are police detectives in San Francisco. Big Bro (Cobb) has a dame habit, and how. His current paramour (Wyatt) has a ne'er do well hubby who is planning to off her for the money. One night honey and hubby meet and much to my surprise wifey does the shooting. Big bro sets little bro on the case and through twists and turns little bro clings tight to the case and it all ends badly but not for the poor widow! Oooo did I give it away?

John Dall is a terribly underrated actor. I love this film and his role in it. The three leads are all excellent, the story is genuinely engaging, with the brothers pitted against one another giving the whole thing a sad, tense edge. The city of SF looks fabulous and I wish you could still drive around it like that. And park everywhere you needed to. And have a nice studio apartment with glass ceilings. I bet they removed those after the earthquake(s). I digress.

In a Hitchcokian way, step by step, Cobb watches in horror how his brother ties the loose ends together, more and more pointing the guilt towards him.
As usually in film noirs of the time, improbable coincidences are necessary to render validity to the plot, but the screenwriters cleverly put all the necessary elements to show how the rookie cop uncovers the truth.
Wyatt is pretty but her acting is unconvincing until, perhaps, the very end, while Dall's character is a little too much of a boy scout to stomach, but Cobb is right on the mark.",1249948800,12,771,4.984496124031008

A man opens a package and loads a revolver, then goes outside and returns. His wife enters the room and talks about their divorce. She finds a paper on the floor, then calls a police lieutenant. His brother is also a detective. Lt. Ed Cullen calls the woman, she is afraid of her husband. When she sees her husband she shoots at him three times! Lt. Cullen sees this happen! Will Ed help her cover it up? The husband set up an alibi at the airport, Ed will take advantage of it. But a couple see him there. The body is found, the police doctor estimates the time of death. That couple answers questions, but they are not helpful.

The detectives go to the victims home to notify his wife. She seems shocked, then faints. The police investigation continues. Det. Andy Cullen puts off his honeymoon. A man shoots a liquor store owner in a robbery. Its the same gun that killed Frazer, based on the ballistic evidence. Ed meets the widow. Later a pawned gun is tested, it matches the murder weapon. It was found by the marina in a fishing boat. This couple have a son who is unemployed. The police look for him, there is a chase on the rooftops, he is caught and questioned. They find money hidden in his brass bed with marks on it. Det. Cullen asks what happened to Frazers money?

Lt. Cullen visits Mrs. Frazer, he is seen by Det. Cullen. What about that story of salmon fishing? The newspaper tells of a jumper off the Golden Gate Bridge. Det. Andy Cullen calls police headquarters to get information. Andy borrows a car to test a witness color perception. Later he accuses Ed of the murder! What can Ed do now? Andys wife calls Eds place, there is no answer. The police arrive, Andy tells what happened. The police send out an alarm, all roads are blocked. Ed knows where to hide until dark. Andy finds Eds car and looks around the old fortress by the Golden Gate Bridge. When they leave at night they are caught. Mrs. Frazer has a lawyer, she passes by Ed. And so it ends.

The ending echoes that of The Third Man, the plot reminds me of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The idea of an experienced police detective getting involved this way seems implausible to me, but it makes a good story. The movies shows views of San Francisco. Does that old fortress (the Presidio) still exist? The lesson here is to not get emotionally involved with wealthy upper class people who just want to use you.",1488499200,,2431,4.419642857142857
