The external box has a quality a little low, but it's fine for me because it's not a commercial movie, so. The best part in the product is the part inside the box. I really loved it! Amazing seller, I'm very grateful, thank you : )",1523836800,,336,4.106060606060606

8065918,4,B0009S2KK6,"silly, campy, a fun, care free movie. Don't take it seriously.",1461369600,,62,4.7272727272727275
8065919,5,B0009S2KK6,This is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen and enjoyed. It had a bit of everything mixed into it and came out perfect. I am amazed at the diversity of Miike and how there is not a typical Miike movie as people say. There is only his vision put on film at the time he makes it. This is not one of his shock type movies but just a good story . This was a excellent movie.,1330214400,,382,3.7875
8065920,4,B0009S2KK6,"for those whos familiar with teen fight movies like crow zero will like this movie. its more or less the same as crows, but more of a comedic version. i found myself laughing hard frequently, but be warned there is a teen sex scene, so wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone under 18.",1322697600,,284,4.377358490566038
8065921,5,B0009S2KK6,"A teenage street-fighter, Kazuyoshi Tamai builds a reputation as the toughest guy in town. He crosses paths with a fellow street-fighter named Takeshi. They challenge each other, but because of a series of unforeseen circumstances, Tamai must withdraw from the bout. Years later they have each achieved a certain level of success -- Tamai as a boxer and Takeshi as a professional wrestler. The two finally get around to settling their old dispute.
  I am biased when it comes to Director, Takashi Miike. He has done like 80+ films in 15yrs! He has a raw and gritty style all his own, and will just direct film one after the other, no matter what it is. This film is awesome! I think everyone should become a fan of Miike, and view THIS FILM in particular.",1215216000,4,755,4.626865671641791
