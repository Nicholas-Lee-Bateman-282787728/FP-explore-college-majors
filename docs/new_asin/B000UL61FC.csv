8579258,4,B000UL61FC,"This film can be a tough watch for some in that it is a bleak portrayal of Japanese life of the underclass/poor of 1970's Japan. The protagonist is a recently divorced young mother who starts the movie off as a singer in an early punk/new wave band. This footage was shot in the original Shinjuku-Loft and features members of The Stalin as extras. You get to see Michiro Endo (singer of The Stalin) getting in fights and acting like a crazy. The film quickly changes as the young mother leaves the seedy club life, after having arranged to steal the band's money, and goes to pick up her toddler son from day-care.

In a move that is part ""Lost Weekend"", the mother sends her son off with his father for the weekend. The rest of the movie is what transpires over the weekend. She hangs out at bars getting drunk and picking fights, she steals for money, she has crazy friends that give her guns to play with, etc. One of the most disturbing scenes is after a quick rape scene she is laying on top of a heap of trash and playing with her gun as she bleeds from her vagina. There is some tension if you are not sure if she will commit suicide or not.

In a good circular movie, she ends the wild weekend by meeting her ex-husband to pick up her husband from him. She is now all cleaned up and ready to start another week.

The film was shot in black and white and has some interesting music in it. The overall story paints a picture of a bleak, nihilistic existence during the 1970's. The polite, clean, stereotypes of Japanese are challenged as we take a visual tour of the underbelly of Japanese society at the time. This film won some awards including Cannes Film Festival. Any fan of Japanese New Wave cinema should see this at least once. Fans of Riot Grrrl or groups like Bikini Kill and Pussy Riot should find this interesting in that we have a tough female lead that is not afraid to take on the world on her own terms. This might be especially tough when considering that the protagonist is a female from the Asian culture.
