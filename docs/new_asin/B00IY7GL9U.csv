6305170,1,B00IY7GL9U,"Silly me. I ordered this DVD based solely on the ridiculous title and confusing premise. I did no further research. That'll teach me. I had heard of David DeCoteau, and knew he was a director of howlingly bad movies, but I didn't know that he strongly preferred extended shots of multiple shirtless young men as his primary focus. It's also clear that he prefers the visual impact of boxer briefs and abs. I'm just observing, not judging. What I will judge is the quality of this movie, and it is poor. Really, really relentlessly poor.

The film ""stars"" Eric Roberts who narrates this mess, and scream queen Linnea Quigley as ""The Stewardess"". Opening with an eleven minute scene of a shirtless guy wandering around the Pacific Northwest (I will give DeCoteau one thing: the location scenery and photography are beautiful) while there's narration explaining some of the backstory. From the outset the degree of padding in this film is notably gargantuan: if you distilled the plot down to its essence you might get a ten minute short; the pacing is likewise ponderously slow. When Bigfoot (Nils Allen Stewart) is seen he looks more like a painted coconut in an orange fright wig than anything conceivably found in nature. In this version Bigfoot enjoys peeping on beefcake, though the continuity and geometry of many scenes is confusing at best. This whole Bigfoot voyeur dynamic is disturbing for all the wrong reasons, though not nearly as disturbing as the multiple rifle-mirror-posing scenes. The Bigfoot shower of death scene was predictable yet didn't pay off like it should have, while the five shirtless guys hunting birds in the forest with rifles just went on and on.

Now you may have noticed I haven't even mentioned D. B. Cooper yet. That's because it accounts for minimal screen time (maybe because Cooper, played by Terence Rotolo, keeps his shirt on at all times) and when he is onscreen it makes very little sense. In short, Cooper hijacks the Northwest 727 (played here by an astonishing number of stock footage aircraft, none of which are either a Northwest aircraft or a 727). There's some Ed Wood day vs. night confusion, some terrible CGI, a lot of guns jamming, and a conspiratorial rendezvous in the woods leading to Cooper and Bigfoot having a fistfight. The conclusion of the fight is somewhat ambiguous; Cooper somehow turns into a Bigfoot. I think. I don't know. I don't care. The scene does feature the best line of the film when Bernie (Cooper's accomplice) asks Cooper ""Can I at least have the money?"", though I won't tell you how that plotpoint is resolved on the off chance you might still want to see this Sasquatch catastrophe. Extras include a commentary track with DeCoteau and Quigley (who is seeing the film for the first time) and trailers. The commentary is much more interesting than the film itself, although the discussion of manscaping gave me the willies.

I have seen a lot of Bigfoot movies and I may have seen a worse one at some point in the distant past (though I can't imagine what it would be), but I've never seen a more pointless one with more shirtless men executing unnecessary wardrobe changes on such a frequent basis. I didn't know what I was getting into with ""Bigfoot vs. D. B. Cooper"", but you have no excuse as you have been warned!",1439424000,6,3297,4.780701754385965

6305173,1,B00IY7GL9U,"Despite the bad reviews (mine included -- read on), this movie is marginally better than this director's other bigfoot film, 1313: Bigfoot Island. Only just.

I did not know who the director was when I pre-ordered this movie; I'm a huge fan of cheesy bigfoot movies so end up getting pretty much all of them. I would have skipped this one, however, if I would have known (having very recently suffered through 1313: Bigfoot Island). There are a few good things about this movie: the lead actor is actually pretty good (although not nearly strong enough an actor to carry the rest of the really horrible cast), the scenery is very nice, and um... and I guess that's about it, really!

Like all of director DeCoteau's previous efforts, this one is his usual soft-core boy porn style of hunky young men doing everything shirtless. Yeah, whatever, that's okay. But the pointless, agonizingly-long scenes of each of the six male leads taking turns stripping down to their underwear in front of a mirror and flexing, exercising and posing with silly cheap prop rifles (obviously bought in the toy department of some cheap discount store) were interminable! There's also a whole lot of walking and running through the woods while a guy in a really bad bigfoot costume peeks around trees. This was obviously the same terrible cheap Party City bigfoot costume used in the other movie and it doesn't look any better or realistic here -- still a guy in a badly-fitted fuzzy suit and rubber mask.

So for some reason bigfoot is apparently infatuated with the boys, as he watches and stalks them, peering into windows to watch them undress, shower, etc. Although it is never explained how bigfoot can see the boys in their second floor rooms when he's leering through ground floor windows. Another mystery, I guess! One by one bigfoot bloodlessly kills each of the guys after watching them masturbate in the shower, do pushups in their underwear, or chasing them like little girls around the house. One of the near-naked lads get felt up pretty good by bigfoot before being bitch slapped to death. The monster apparently has some questions about his own identity....

Where does the DB Cooper part come in? Its sort of squeezed in in tiny little bits throughout the movie, and there is a bit of an ah-ha moment near the end when a plot point is revealed. But then DB kills bigfoot and changes into bigfoot, himself! Huh? WTF? Yeah, I don't get it.

So, pretty much this one is a stinker, although not quite as pungent as 1313: Bigfoot Island. Still, I would avoid it at all costs -- for the bigfoot completest only! Bad.",1407542400,3,2607,4.720879120879121

This is one of those times where I wish Mystery Science Theater 3 Thousand was still on the air. This would be perfect for it. If you could watch an MST3K movie, without the bots, and enjoy it, you will love this. The first 10 min is just the guy walking shirtless with Sasquatch grunting and checking him out. That is it. No dialogue, ok so Eric Roberts voice over technically counts. The men in their underwear scenes are classic. Someone should make a drinking game out of this movie. Sasquatch is always lurking in a ""I want these guys for more than violence"" sort of way. The only thing missing is some really good/bad catch phrases. This movie was incredibly bad and if you love bad movies, you will love this. If you think I am talking Armaggedon bad, then you aren't thinking bad enough and should re-evaluate your definition of bad. Did I mention the word bad enough for you? Then, watch it.

6305177,1,B00IY7GL9U,"I have 100+ bigfoot movies (docs, horror, kids, etc.) and this may be the worst I have ever seen. To echo the first reviewer, this is yet another movie that is mostly aimed at the gay market with long shots of the males (no women are shown in the movie) without their shirts on talking about shooting turkeys for Thanksgiving set in 1971. The closest this movie gets to 1971 is about 2013 and WA state is never this sunny around November.

One shirtless guy wanders up to a house thinking it would be abandoned (yet the million dollar home is completely furnished) and more shirtless guys come out to the porch and offer him a beer. 2 of the guys go for an aimless run, you see for consecutive shots of guys stripping to their underwear and practice pointing their guns at the mirror. Along the way, bigfoot (minimal effort was put into this crappy costume starts killing these ""actors"" inside the house (bigfoot is just suddenly inside.) The killings are mostly bloodless.

When DB finally lands, he fights & kills bigfoot and somehow he turns into bigfoot (I guess like when a werewolf bites you.) Eric Roberts (I thought he was sober these days, doing this makes one question his sobriety) does the voiceover. Linnea Quigley is heard as the flight attendant (I guess this didn't pay much as she was recently one a website asking for money to fix her leaking roof.)

I hope my spoiler alert stopped anyone from buying this horridly acted, pathetic plot, piss poor special effects waste of time. Normally I add ""for completionists only"" but am even struggling to offer that encouragement for this release.",1402790400,11,1606,4.667844522968198
6305178,1,B00IY7GL9U,"This is gay erotica disguised as a movie. It's nothing but really long segments of half naked gay guys running in the woods, taking off their shorts and posing in mirrors, taking showers, all while Bigfoot watches them from behind trees and in the home.

Throw in some narration by Eric Roberts, Linnea Quigley briefly talking, and a few interspersed bits of a guy acting as DB Cooper and that's the whole movie. No joke. All I can think of is what a waste that great DVD cover painting is to be stuck on this piece of garbage.

8646326,1,B00IY7GL9U,"As a Bigfoot and D.B. Cooper aficionado, I saw this movie on eBay; it was cheap, so I bought it without reading any reviews or doing an research ahead of time. I mean, come on, the idea of Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper--in theory--sounds fantastic and fun. Even though I didn't expect a five star film, I guess the hopeful part of my mind expected a lackluster movie with decent and thoughtful effort and something I may watch every couple of years for a pop culture lark that incorporates two of my lifelong interests--the Bigfoot and D.B. Cooper legends. In addition, Bigfoot and D.B. Cooper appear in the majority of my fiction and comedy novels--in my Ripper the Clown novels, D.B. Cooper is the President of the United States--and even while presenting comedy, I treat the legends with dignity and respect with research and factual information backing up the fiction. So, I guess, in relation to what I do, I was expecting similar treatment, but oh how I was wrong!

After watching this film, only the premise--D.B. Cooper meets Bigfoot--is decent, and anything after the general name of the film spirals into the abyss of wasted time and emotional agony There is so much wrong with this tear-worthy and indescribably rotten movie. It's a travesty with zero entertainment value.

Here are my observations...

--This movie was released in 2014; it's based in 1972, yet, everything looks like ... well, like it was made in 2014. The producers obviously made little to attempt at making the film appear as if it were taking place in the 1970s. The mansion/lodge has modern furnishings and decor; the shots of the airport are modern; the tattoos were obviously contemporaneous; the clothes were not 70s style. Now, I must say, that the inside of D.B. Cooper's briefcase did look vintage, and the phone at the lodge appeared old as well--but the phone was not a 70s variety of dial phone and more like a late 80s/early 90s touchtone wall phone. The idea that they would attempt a film based in 1972 and make little effort to make it look period is pretty shameful. With all the liberties they took with the D.B. Cooper case, they should've just discarded the actual time-frame and based the story in modern times to avoid any attempts at making the 1970s era look genuine.

--If you enjoy movies where the all-male cast is completely shirtless the entire time, then this may be a movie for you (and I'm not counting Linnea Quigley as the unseen voice of the stewardess during the Cooper skyjacking; I'm presuming Quigley wasTina Mucklow). These guys do everything shirtless The guys drink beer shirtless. They turkey hunt shirtless.  They all hang at the lodge shirtless. And the lodge must be haunted or possessed because, for reasons unknown, the majority of the hunters decided to do the same thing: change their shorts in front of a mirror and pose with and without their rifles. (they never changed shirts because they never wore shirts!) What an ingenious plot! I was waiting for someone to forget the attempts at presenting a 1970s time-frame and whip out a cell phone for a few selfies. And apparently, in November 1972, it was warm enough to walk around shirtless inside and outside and to o go hunting no less with no shirts and in shorts; this notwithstanding the fact that, on the night of the D.B. Cooper skyjacking, the weather was pretty bad ... which leads me to...

--If one is making a film about the D.B. Cooper skyjacking--or Bigfoot or any historical figure--you would expect one to properly research the subject matter and, as I stated earlier, in relation to my own work--treat the subject matter with respect and dignity. Unfortunately, at best, the filmmakers probably glossed over the Wikipedia page for D.B. Cooper, learned a few basic facts and got rolling on this abomination.

--The beginning of the movie shows Cooper preparing for the skyjacking; he is tying his tie. Some simple research would and could have provided information to the filmmakers that Cooper wore a clip-on tie that he left on the airliner before his escape. The clip-on tie has been in the possession of the FBI since 1972. This is elementary. In addition, the DVD cover artwork shows Cooper in the woods and wearing his tie, and this was an early indicator that the producers made zero attempt at keeping basic information factual. At the end of the film, when Cooper lands in the woods, he is still wearing that tie that his real-life counterpart un-clipped and left aboard the 727.

--In real life, the ransom money Cooper received consisted of 10,000 $20 bills, yet in the film, the money is shown in a tiny bag approximately half the size of your standard child book bag. Laughable. In the film, they state that Cooper requested four parachutes, yet during in the scene where Cooper takes the parachutes and the tiny money bag, only one parachute is shown--along with the aforementioned little bag that is supposed to contain 10,000 $20 bills. Now, in reality,  the money bag weighed approximately 20 pounds, but in the movie, it's carried around like nothing.

--The flight crew did not refer to the skyjacker as Cooper nor did they know his name/alias during the skyjacking. Yet, in the film, they refer to him by name. In addition, many aspects of the intercom conversation between flight crew and Cooper didn't take place--including the silly line where Cooper tells the crew he needs to count the money.

--Cooper jumped from the 727 in the evening hours; it was dark and rainy outside; yet, in the film, Cooper lands during the day, and it's sunny outside ... not a raindrop in sight ... and again, it was warm enough for the hunters to be out turkey hunting in shorts and no shirts.

--Many scenes are repeated and shown ad nauseam throughout this film including the airport and terminal scenes when discussing the Cooper skyjacking as well as the Bigfoot strike scenes... which leads me to...

--In other movies and documentaries, I've seen some bad Bigfoot costumes over the years, but wow, just wow, this one is the absolute worst. And Bigfoot is red. And he's a crazed killer who can manifest inside the lodge and then outside the lodge and then back inside the lodge in seconds; he must also have the ability to transport himself around the area like some sci-fi monster. Bigfoot looks like a red version of the Gremlin from the ""Nightmare at 20,000 feet"" episode of The Twilight Zone starring William Shatner. I'm doubting so, but perhaps, just perhaps, this was an intentional nod to the Twilight Zone episode about a paranormal incident on an airliner in a painfully wretched film about a skyjacker who jumps from an airliner. Eh, probably not. That would be too meaningful. In addition to the Bigfoot costume looking like the Twilight Zone-Shatner Gremlin, Bigfoot's red hair looks like stiff and shiny astro-turf.

--Side note: apparently, Bigfoot has an affinity for one of the hunters because, in a long and drawn out scene that I fast forwarded through, Bigfoot admires his abs and underpants before swiping him to death.

--(Another) side note: When Bigfoot kills the shirtless guys, none--repeat none--attempt to fight back or provide any opposition to the carnage.

--(3rd) side note: when he's angry, Bigfoot sounds like a cougar or mountain lion.

--(4th) side note: when D.B. Cooper parachutes from the 727 and lands in the wilderness, by pure dumb luck, Cooper's accomplice (one of the shirtless hunters) is also in the woods wherein he coincidentally and almost immediately finds Cooper upon landing--in the dense, thick wood no less.

--Instead of wasting probably 1/2 of the film's length with guys posing in the mirror and changing shorts--scenes that I fast forwarded through--the filmmakers (and I use this term very loosely) needed to spend more time on the confrontation between D.B. Cooper and Bigfoot. After all, as the Bigfoot vs. D.B. Cooper film title infers, a fight scene was these two legendary figures was going to take place ... well, I wasn't asking for any lengthy and classic They Live Roddy Piper-Keith David style of battle, but whoa ... the final fight scene lasted probably 45 seconds, and it ended when Bigfoot bit D.B Cooper in the leg and Cooper simply kicked Bigfoot in the head. The legendary monster--that just remorsefully slaughtered a group of shirtless hunters (with no blood mind you and with zero opposition)--was taken down with a simple kick to the face. And yes, the dialogue indicated that Cooper ""killed"" Bigfoot with that little kick.

--But Bigfoot's silly death did not signal the end of this film, and there is more asinine ridiculousness afoot; after killing Bigfoot, Cooper turns into Bigfoot--a transformation that we never completely see probably because they lacked a second red Gremlin suit or they had no idea how to get Cooper's black suit onto said costume. But here's the deal: someone must've been drunk or high--or drunker or higher when they first started writing the script--because at this point in the plot, the movie turns into a werewolf movie where, apparently, whoever is bitten by Bigfoot turns into a Bigfoot creature ... and then the Eric Roberts narration tells us that no one ever found Cooper but they are still hunting for Bigfoot or something to that effect as a lame way to end this atrocity. But wait ... when Bigfoot killed all the dead shirtless hunters, they failed to turn into Bigfoots ... or Bigfeet ... whatever ... you get what I'm saying. The non-bloody slaughter we saw featured no shirtless hunters turning into Bigfoot--and in fact, one of the naked dead bodies remained propped up in the lodge shower for his other shirtless buddies to systematically discover and run away from ... he was no Bigfoot! Maybe Bigfoot never bit the hunters, but eh, there is no logic here or anywhere in this deplorable attempt at film making, so why should anyone expect this twisted element of the film to make any sense.

--Oh, in case, at this point, you may have thought otherwise: the acting was pathetic and deplorable and the dialogue really cheesy, pathetic and forced.

--This is probably elementary, but the title is very misleading and the 45 second fight scene at the end doesn't really justify the Bigfoot vs. D.B. Cooper name. Reworking the title and incorporating ""Shirtless Guys"" in there somewhere would probably help deter people like me from purchasing this DVD and thereby being angry and unhappy with said purchase and writing a scathing review.

On a personal note, I don't know how much money it cost to make this film, but if I had identical funds, I could've cranked out a decent feature on the same topic that would've handled the legendary subject matter decently and respectfully and the presentation would have been entertaining and engaging without any shirtless men running around.

Lesson learned: the next time I decide to make an impulse buy, I need to read reviews first.",1472774400,,10903,4.8562970936490855
8646327,1,B00IY7GL9U,"I discuss the plot. Impossible to spoil.

This film combines the real life story of D.B. Cooper (Terence J. Rotolo) who in 1971 hijacked a plane and parachuted out over the Pacific NW and the not so real life man in a red guerilla suit pretending to be Bigfoot. The first 10 minutes of the film consists of one buff guy walking without a shirt on while being snarled at by Bigfoot. The second ten minutes are two guys jogging without shirts on, being snarled at by Bigfoot. The next 20 minutes has several shirtless guys. dressing, undressing, talking a shower, posing in front of the mirror with some pup tent poses. The shirtless guys continued through the whole film including a semi-erotic encounter with BF. Oh yes, they work DB Cooper in there somehow.

Eric Roberts narrates and Linnea Quigley gives us a stewardess voice. It is clear the whole aspect of male erotica is to spoof the basic horror film genre of using perfectly built women who jog, shower, and pose to the delight of male audiences. Yes, it was overkill to drive home the point, although Ms. Quigley made her living showing her wares in such films. Thank you for ""Night of the Demons.""

Once you realize what they are doing, it isn't that bad, it just doesn't get any better. It might be funny to a group of ladies.",1458259200,,1288,4.51931330472103
