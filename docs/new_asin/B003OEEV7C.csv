They also love to dance with it, and mimic the ferret rolling over.

There are 3 parts to the video, and each can be played at different stages of learning, or they can watch all three. We took them one at a time. Now they watch all three parts.",1391731200,,520,3.8055555555555554
8606790,5,B003OEEV7C,"Om is sooo much fun! My kids already know the songs by heart and just want to play each activity non-stop. With three kids in the house someone is asking to watch it everyday! I don't mind because my kids are asked to move rather than sit and watch.  What a great concept and the fact that the session stops after 15-20 minutes is just perfect.  They recommend on the box to repeat the same session a few times over before switching to the next session, I love this idea mostly for my youngest child as he truly is thrilled that he can sing along and do the moves.  But for my older kids, they just want to watch all three sessions and start all over again.  Truly interactive and progressive!  -A satisfied mom",1275436800,2,711,4.276119402985074
