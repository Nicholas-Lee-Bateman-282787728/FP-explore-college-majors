8496125,1,B002WCDQIM,"BE WARNED: This DVD will not play on my standard Sony DVD player even though Amazon describes it as ""Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.)"" The reason is that it is in PAL format. So dig through the fine print in your DVD player manual to make sure that it will play PAL format before you buy this DVD. My Region 1 Sony will play NTSC only, so it will not play it.",1300924800,,367,3.972972972972973
