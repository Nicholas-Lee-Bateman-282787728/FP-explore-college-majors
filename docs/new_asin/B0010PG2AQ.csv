8238172,3,B0010PG2AQ,"To start with, the product review listed above is wrong.  Captain Scarface is about as big a bad guy as you can get.  Lief Ericson is the hero and love interest for Virginia Grey.  It is filmed on a very low budget  and very slanted as anti-communist, which isn't surprising considering it's time period.  The plot involves the bad guys, who have an atom bomb; how they got that isn't explained,  but  characters talk about having recently been in Russia so, presumably from there.  The bomb is to be exploded in the Panama Canal and Lief has to save the day.  Ending is really abrupt; like the producers ran out of money and just tacked on an ending.  I wouldn't seek this out unless you are a fan of one of the 3 stars; my copy is in Mill Creek 50 movie set which made it a real bargain.  Worth the 80 minutes to watch it; not anything really special is my vote.",1305331200,,864,4.2392638036809815

The film begins with a view of the sea from shore. A steamship explodes, as if its cargo was dangerous. One man escapes on a life preserver from the sip Banos, but he is shot by a machine gun. Next there is a scene in port where the Banos is loaded with cargo. They will carry passengers as well. The captain speaks about the voyafe. Clegg has checked the ship. ""I want it now."" Sam drops into a hotel for a drink, he was shot out of a job at a plantation and wants to get back to the states pronto. Others will leave on the Banos. Clegg shows up to see Mr. Kroll. Elsa Yeager meets her father and Kroll. Sam is wanted throughout the country. The atmosphere is moody and suspenseful; something is going on. Clegg gets his money after Kroll can't double-cross him! Sam Wilton now has a plan to leave on the Banos.

The conversation between ""Kroll"" and Captain Tregdor warns of some plot. Kate Dilts recognizes a change in their cabin. ""Kroll"" warns Elsa. The Panama Canal reduces their sailing by 7,400 miles. Its value makes it the most guarded. Elsa finds her father missing from his cabin. Down in the hold Dr. Yeager learns of a plot to destroy the Panama Canal! Captain Tregdor threatens Elsa's life unless Dr. Yeager cooperates. We learn about Yeager's past in Sverdlosk! The ship has an all-volunteer crew. Captain Tregdor becomes suspicious of ""Kroll"". There will be no help for Kate Dilts. Fred complains to the Captain, Sam Wilton escapes. Who went into the sea? Will Wilton force the Captain to bring him to Dr. Yeager? There is a fight in the hold. Sam knows how to throw a machete.

Sam, Elsa, and Crofton enter the radio room. Crofton taps out a message, a destroyer get the message. The Navy captures the ship and the terrorists, the passengers are released for a happy ending. You can see the smiles on the actors' faces when this story ends.
This drama is still entertaining. Its cold-war plot seems amusing now (when you think about it). It shows what people watched for entertainment then.",1267574400,,2036,4.5422343324250685
