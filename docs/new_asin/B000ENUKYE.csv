8111701,4,B000ENUKYE,"Desert Punk is a ridiculous anime. That's what makes it great. There is not much of a point, other than making you laugh. There's no point explaining the story since the story doesn't matter. The animation, voice acting, dialogue, and comedy are all very well done. Despite being very low brow, this anime is entertaining, and a bit addicting. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. If you want to laugh a lot Desert Punk is for you.",1353888000,,437,4.407407407407407
