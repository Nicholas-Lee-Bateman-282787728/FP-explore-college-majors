8334285,5,B001PQN7X0,"I found this guitar theory dvd to be very informative and comprehensive. As an advanced guitar player and recording artist, it certainly met my needs; and it is an excellent music theory refresher.",1381276800,,197,5.0
8334286,3,B001PQN7X0,"I am a music major. My instruments are jazz guitar,piano, and voice. I've been studying music for years and I am currently at the university. I purchased this a few years ago when I was at the beginning stages of jazz improvisation. This DVD is helpful, but I wish it was longer and provided more insights about music theory and jazz guitar. Every one has a personal opinion, but personally, there are other DVD's and books that are better. A really good book is Jody Fishers Jazz Guitar. It is detailed and provides a practice CD.

If you are a beginner or an experience player who just wants to learn basic theory without having to attend a class or read a book, this DVD will do the job just fine.",1324684800,4,700,4.384615384615385

8334288,2,B001PQN7X0,"I didn't like this DVD. I am an intermediate guitar player who never learned any theory. After deciding to learn some I purchased this and it was everything I expected. It is a bunch of diagrams and shots of a guy's hand playing notes on a guitar neck. The information is valid and you can learn chord theory from this but it is really boring to watch and there is hardly any qualifying information. I found a couple of guys on youtube that did much better jobs of teaching this material - and it was free. Also, the lessons revolve around reading sheet music - who reads sheet music anymore? I need TAB!",1264982400,10,604,4.353982300884955
