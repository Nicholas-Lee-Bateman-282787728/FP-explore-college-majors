8527912,3,B008H1Q3C8,"The cover and title make this look like a new release horror movie.  I was definitely fooled.  But it's actually a 2003 flick by noted German schlockmeister Olaf Ittenbach that was originally titled Garden of Love.  (Ok, the title change makes sense).  Born Undead opens with the gory massacre of a dozen people who appear to be hippies in a large house.  Only a young girl manages to survive--but after waking from a two year coma she has no memories of the traumatic event or her former life and is adopted by her Scottish cousins.  Years later as a student at university she sees troubling visions of her dead father on television screens and thinks she might be going crazy.  Finally finding out the truth about her past, she travels back to her childhood home to see if it brings back any memories.  What she finds is something far more horrible--and gory.  This isn't a good movie by any accepted definition of the term but between the gooey gore effects, stilted line readings, bizarre plot twists, and the occasional equally bizarre visual effects Born Undead is actually pretty fun.  Sandwiched among all of the unintentional laughs there are even a couple of intentional ones--a gory television infomercial in which the sharpness of knives is demonstrated and a throwaway gag involving police brutality in the lobby of the police station.  It's even possible that Olaf Ittenbach is a funny guy and that all the laughs in Born Undead are completely intentional and that the movie is meant to be a silly gore comedy along the lines of Peter Jackson's early work.  All I can say for sure is that Born Undead is pretty gory and that it made me laugh.  A lot.  The Blu-ray comes with English and German language soundtracks but there are no English subtitles.  The English language soundtrack offers a strange assortment of accents but it looks like the movie might have been shot in English anyway--in some cases with actors who don't speak the language particularly well.  The picture quality is quite good considering the movie's age and low budget--it's very likely an Olaf Ittenbach film has never looked this good before.",1362873600,,2132,4.8
