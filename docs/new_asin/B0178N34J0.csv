As my son and I were watching I couldn't help but think, ""This actress has to know someone to be the star of this video."" Of course that was confirmed in the closing credits. The use of clip art was worst part.",1465430400,,275,4.111111111111111
8738333,1,B0178N34J0,"worst DVD EVER. not worth the money or time. My daughter was completely bored out of her mind. As a teacher, there are much better products out there.",1461110400,,150,4.392857142857143

8738335,5,B0178N34J0,"I wish I could give this 10 stars. Entertaining, fun, and paced just right for kindergartners to memorize their sight words. Their reading will improve dramatically with the repeated playing of this video. Parents and teachers may find it useful to create 3x5 flashcards to accompany this presentation. If your five year old needs help, get this DVD.",1456272000,,350,5.051724137931035
