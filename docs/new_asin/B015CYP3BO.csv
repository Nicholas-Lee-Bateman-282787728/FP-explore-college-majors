8733213,4,B015CYP3BO,"I have Curtis' other DVD and I like them because they're energetic.  Plus, the boxing moves are new to me.  It's all very doable and you can stay in your chair for most of this DVD; there is just one standing section, but I think even that can be adapted to seated.  He's cheerful and realistic.  The only small drawback is the lighting is a bit strange:  The video is lit from the back, through a big window in a rec center and it's not flattering for the participants.  You can see just fine, though.",1471046400,4,502,4.231578947368421
