3529769,5,B001DF67XU,"I was amazed at this well rounded documentary of an English crime boss. In this film we meet Dominick Noonan (a member of a powerful crime family in Manchester, England) and learn the story of his life through his own words, judicious editing and clever interviewing.  At first, Noonan seems like the type of guy you'd like to have a few pints with as he tells these amazing tales in an engaging manner.  But you then remember his stories are facts, not tales, and sometimes involve grisly violence.

This film does an amazing job of picturing Dominick as an amiable fellow one moment and in the next, flashes of the brutal man underneath.  I have no idea how the BBC journalist, Donal MacIntyre, got the amount of access he did to this lifestyle without consequences.

My only complaint is that the dvd extras were deleted scenes and I would have preferred to see a commentary of this extraordinary film.",1253923200,,905,4.666666666666667
3529770,4,B001DF67XU,"Though I'm not much for documentaries, a friend recommended this flick so I gave it a shot and enjoyed it immensely. A very human face is painted on an otherwise historically vicious neighborhood gangster such that you almost feel sorry for him .. but not quite. If you're the type of person who likes the concept of people who live in a neighborhood looking out for the neighborhood, you'll enjoy this documentary.",1246406400,2,415,4.777777777777778
3529771,5,B001DF67XU,"There's a real disconnect here between the violent lives led by the gangsters in this documentary and their seemingly benign personalities as depicted in the film. It's difficult to believe that the head gangster is as vicious as he is portrayed. Also, why would he allow a film crew in to see all that he does? There are seeming confessions to certain types of lawless bahaviour, so this was reckless of the gangsters involved. Still, you'll get a real look at the tawdry side of British criminal life. The characters all seem to be nearly subhuman in their criminality. A great piece of work.",1238112000,5,594,4.721153846153846
3529772,5,B001DF67XU,"Despite being an American, I'm very interested in England and am a bit of an Anglophile so I generally gravitate towards the country's films. A Very British Gangster was an exceptional documentary that revealed the full complexity of a man whose life seems to have already been decided. We discover at the end of it that he is going back to jail but his attitude and everything about his character suggest that his final destination is a foregone conclusion. The police follow him everywhere and it's quite likely that the filmmaker was not the only individual who recorded many of these conversations. What we find most is that Dominic Noonan is, in many ways, a normal man with a variety of relationships and concerns that must be negotiated. Most of his criminality is merely hinted at here, but it seems very unlikely that--even if he is re-released--he will conjure up the will to change his life. This is an endearing and well-crafted portrait of a doomed man.",1230249600,10,966,4.790419161676646

8293282,4,B001DF67XU,"A Very British Gangster is one of the most underrated and beautifully-shot crime documentaries available. What distinguishes this documentary from most others is how it's directed. Far from the typical gritty hand-held guerrilla style of documentary work, this film is filled with brilliant cinematography and effective crane shots. The British rock soundtrack is an excellent backdrop to footage of the seedier sides of Manchester.

Dominic is no Tony Soprano; despite the flashy suits and manicured appearance, his home life seems to be fairly working class. Where Noonan loses credibility is with his entourage, which is almost exclusively made up of teenagers. It calls into question not how dangerous Dominic is, but if he's as powerful as others make him out to be.

It's still impossible to deny his family's reputation, as the film reveals Manchester's major reaction to the death of one the infamous Noonans. His constant court appearances serve as a testament to his alleged criminal activity, and some of the things that this gangster confesses are shockingly honest and revealing. So while it's hard to say exactly where Dominic Noonan ranked on the totem pole of British gangsters, it's safe to say that this was a well-shot documentary.",1355443200,,1250,5.245

8293285,1,B001DF67XU,"I was puzzled when I watched this.  At first, I thought that the DvD may have had the wrong program on it.  THis was more of a pulp documentary than a movie. IT was NOT more terrifying than SCAR FACE.  It was hard to stay awake through it, as well.  I even doubt the honesty and I suspect a lot of exaggeration was written into the lines of the subjects portrayed in this ""movie""... sorry, I wasn't happy with this purchase.  Maybe it is just me?  I don't know.  Scotty/Sioux City",1291075200,,480,4.208791208791209
8293286,1,B001DF67XU,"It is very British To be Gangster? or to mangle the English Language? I mean you guys Basically Invented it?
Is it British to be Proud to be Gay? What is so Cool about this particular Gangster? And who cares what good does he do for the community? How can he be A Catholic If he is a Criminal of the lowest Denominator? that he may be bold and crass and so many other things but that he is nothing but a street goon who needs to be behind bars.
Hanging out with Small Kids who smoke all young boys? The best thing about this is the Lesson CRIME DOES NOT PAY.",1288310400,,558,3.9910714285714284
8293287,2,B001DF67XU,"Noonan is not British.  He is Irish and he is anti-British.  True, he is probably quite a hard-nut.  But I don't know what this documentary was trying to say.  But he is certainly not a 'very British' gangster at all.  Quite the opposite, in fact.

And by the way, that bloke who thinks he will one day become an 'actor' is very funny, indeed.  Good luck to you, mate.  Perhaps you could become a comedian instead?",1280448000,,414,4.355263157894737
8293288,1,B001DF67XU,"The premise of this documentary could honestly be turned into a comedic masterpiece. The homosexual british gangster who arrogantly preaches his illegal activities to the world, going around and solving petty issues with his ""hard"" crew of neighborhood teenagers. Why would he ever agree to make this movie? He's a retard, that's why. The real gangsters don't need to open their mouths in order to attain the respect of those around them. This moron constantly runs his mouth so that he can prove to his community that he's a ""gangster"" not to be reckoned with. Within the first 10 minutes you realize he's not really much of a gangster. He's British.

Watch it. You're in for a good laugh.",1275177600,2,690,4.798319327731092
