8666141,4,B00LIFADHG,I like it but not as much as the Blood Moon! It's more talk like in seminars and the Blood Moon DVD is more clear w/ backgrounds like the movies. Not all who watch the Disc 4 are into seminars or conferences but some are young and wants movie type of explanations.,1423612800,5,264,4.096153846153846
