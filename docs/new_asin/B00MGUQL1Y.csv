8672156,5,B00MGUQL1Y,"I received a review copy of this disc, which captures a moving May 2014 concert conducted by Daniel Barenboim on the 50th anniversary of his first performance with the Berlin Philharmonic.

The concert begins with a salute to Shakespeare (happy 450th birthday, Will) in the form of two musical works inspired by his Falstaff character: Nicolai's overture to The Merry Wives of Windsor and Elgar's symphonic study. I enjoyed the first but wasn't familiar with the second, and I can't say I'll be coming back to it often. It seems a rather aimless and unmemorable work for its nearly 40 minutes. However, if you like Elgar, then you'll want to have it -- and it's doubtful another performance will ever surface on Blu-ray, since it's here only due to Barenboim's championing of it.

Consider those pieces appetizers for the final work on the program, Tchaikovsky's monumental Symphony No. 5. I initially found the first movement underwhelming, having become accustomed to Gergiev's more hard-driving approach (on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Symphonies-Nos-4-6-Blu-ray/dp/B005HK8KXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: Symphonies Nos. 4-6 [Blu-ray</a>], which unfortunately has poor picture quality and some of the most irritating camerawork I've encountered on a concert Blu-ray disc). But then come the exquisite second and third movements, wherein Barenboim and the orchestra do an incredible job of conveying Tchaikovsky's intense sensitivity. In the final movement, with the musicians unable to resist exchanging looks of pleasure, Barenboim shapes a majestic and cathartic conclusion that might very well leave you in tears. Bravo! (But don't just take it from me. Those with sharp eyes will see renowned opera tenor Rolando Villazon in the rapturous audience exclaiming his own bravo at the conclusion.)

Up until now, Barenboim has not been one of my favorite conductors. I'll need to start reconsidering that. I've been very impressed by his autumnal performances, such as this one and his Brahms 1st (on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berliner-Philharmoniker-Wagner-Elgar-Brahms-Blu-ray/dp/B0040Y7EV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berliner Philharmoniker: Wagner, Elgar, Brahms [Blu-ray</a>]). Another reviewer notes that he strongly prefers a regular-DVD performance of the Tchaikovsky 5th with Abbado conducting the same orchestra (on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berliner-Philharmoniker-in-Japan/dp/B0047VLHEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berliner Philharmoniker in Japan</a>). I haven't seen it, but Abbado was an extraordinary conductor, and I consider many of his performances as close to definitive as you can get. However, I wouldn't want to be without Barenboim's own noteworthy take on the symphony in the superior Blu-ray format.

Speaking of the technical side of things, the camerawork on this disc is quite good -- there's a bit more roaming around the hall than usual, but it doesn't detract from the performance. The sound is very good, although it lacks a bit of transparency (if you have a surround-sound setup, you'll want to be sure to switch from the PCM Stereo default to the DTS HD 5.1 audio setting). The picture quality is of a corresponding level -- slightly coarser than I expected for a 2014 disc, but still excellent.

By the way, this disc includes a 5-minute backstage interview with Barenboim as a bonus feature. It's in German, but English subtitles are provided. Informally captured during the intermission, the interview includes his thoughts on his long relationship with the orchestra, the enduring modernity of the Philharmonie Berlin hall, and the Elgar and Tchaikovsky works. At one point, he makes a profound statement: ""If you have no contact with music whatsoever, you miss out on a great human wealth,"" he says. ""Everyone is more or less gifted; some people play, others listen. But I am deeply convinced: If you have no contact with music, you miss a very important dimension of human experience.""

Aren't we lucky to live in an age where -- via the vehicle of a Blu-ray disc -- we can, mere months after the event, tap into this ""human wealth"" by experiencing a great performance by what is arguably the best orchestra in the world?",1414886400,5,4333,5.794348508634223
8672157,4,B00MGUQL1Y,"This is a well recorded concert presented with knowledgeable camera work that gives a good mixture of general and detailed coverage leading to viewer involvement. The sound is well balanced giving a cohesive and well defined sound stage and presented in DTS 5.1 as well as stereo.

The concert celebrates a number of anniversaries as well as the usual founding of the orchestra in 1882. The other dates include the 50th anniversaries of Barenboims conducting debut with the orchestra, the opening of the current concert hall and the 25th anniversary of the ending of the Berlin Wall. All of these subjects are covered during an interview given by Barenboim during the concert interval and included here as a 10 minute bonus feature.

The concert opens with a genial but meticulous performance of Nicolais overture to the Merry Widow. The Shakespearean connection is continued with a performance of Elgars Falstaff which was intended to be a highly detailed musical analysis and portrayal of that character. That includes his earlier period of riotous comradeship with the young prince Hall then his later rejection when the prince became king and also his ridiculing by the Merry Wives of Windsor.

Barenboim has long been associated with this piece, even though it was new to the orchestra. Barenboims commitment to the piece will soon be reinforced by his publication of a book on the subject.  His depth of knowledge is abundantly clear throughout this performance which will arguably become recognised as an interpretation and performance of reference quality and considerable perception both in terms of individual detail and overall concept. The orchestra and Barenboim deserve to be fully congratulated upon their joint achievement here and admirers of Elgar will find much to savour throughout the piece as recorded.

Barenboim is not so readily associated with Tchaikovsky although here the orchestra has been linked to many fine recordings of the fifth symphony, not least those by Karajan and Abbado (in a thrilling performance finely captured by Japanese engineers in the Suntory Hall, Tokyo).

On this occasion Barenboim directs a weighty and meaningful version of the piece, very similar to his approach to the Elgar. The relatively steady pace adopted right from the start sets the tone of the interpretation which in imposing rather than thrilling in a more obvious dramatic manner. This is less of a problem in the central movements but the outer movements simply lack the sort of combustible fire that can so often be experienced elsewhere. Even ignoring the obvious Russian conductors there are numerous examples of non-Russians that take a more compulsive view. Apart from Karajan and Abbado as previously mentioned, it is easy to recall the performances by others such as Szell, Solti, Tilson Thomas and Jansons all of whom generate an altogether higher level of adrenalin without sacrificing care to detail.

To be fair, the audience were highly enthusiastic and others interested in purchasing this disc may well share their enthusiasm. For myself, I immediately played the 1994 DVD of Abbados Japanese performance final movement to compare and confirm impressions.  The sheer quality of the genuine 16:9 widescreen visuals and genuine DTS 5.1 of the earlier recording is striking and remains fully capable of technical comparison. The performance itself, given by many of the current orchestra in their relative youth, was of an altogether different league of electricity  one of Abbados finest live recordings.

This new disc must therefore be mainly recognised for its outstanding Falstaff and the genial overture by Nicolai. For many collectors, the Falstaff alone may well be worth purchasing the disc, such is its perception and quality. Those mainly attracted by the Tchaikovsky can find more engaging and exciting performances elsewhere, not least the one by Abbado with the same forces and on the same label.",1412035200,4,3940,5.23968253968254
