4990425,1,B006HGXGP2,"I first came across this film when I saw it listed in the ""Recommendations"" section on my Amazon page (probably due to my Amazon searches of Paris, and Paris-related purchases!). I spent 10 weeks in Paris in the fall of 2009, and during those 2 1/2 wonderful months, I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with this city!

Rather than some tropical locale (which I'm sure I'd love as well), Paris IS paradise to me! The Eiffel Tower, the Seine, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, the Montparnasse, the museums, the restaurants, the neighborhood patisseries, boulangeries & bistros, the Paris Metro, I LOVE it ALL!!

So although I do not consider myself a Francophile for the entire nation of France, I'm now, most DEFINITELY a ""Paris-phile""!

I truly  LOVE  Paris, and long to go back soon. I even dream of one day getting a ""pied 'a' terre"" in the city (which I can use when I'm there, AND rent out for income when I'm not) which I can not only customize to my preferences (decor, furniture, etc.) but also to have a permanent place where I can store certain things (like clothing) that I don't want to have to keep hauling back & forth across the ocean in my luggage (especially with all the baggage fees these days!). I would LOVE to have a ""place of my own"" in Paris, and living there semi-permanently (for example, a few, or even several months out of each year -- similar to how those ""snowbirds"" living in colder/northern areas go to places like Florida for the winter) because I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY adore Paris!

Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris-France-The-City-Of-Magic-A-Dream-Vacation-Tour/dp/B00B67UTNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris France, The City Of Magic: A Dream Vacation Tour</a>&nbsp;is an UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE movie about an otherwise WONDERFUL city. I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE wasting time on this film (though I guess, its not exactly ""wasting"" since I finished various mindless chores [like sorting laundry, dusting, folding clothes, etc.] with the movie in the background) because it was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!

First of all, this film was totally boring - I couldn't even sit through it for more than 5 minutes without getting up to sort laundry, dust, and fold clothes while ""watching"". Yes, that's how incredibly bad it was -- even doing dull chores were more preferable than just sitting & watching this with full concentration.

With its brownish-tint photos (that were likely intended to harken back to a simpler time) and dry monotonous-toned narration, this film, in many ways, reminded me of the boring black & white filmstrips that those of us in the ""older"" generations (born in the early to mid 1980s or prior) used to have to watch in school (especially in grade school) that frequently put many students (if not entire classes!) to sleep from the moment the lights went out in the classroom & the filmstrip began until the lights went back on in the classroom!

Furthermore, not only is this film totally boring, but also, because the film-maker wasted so much time, effort & energy concentrating on the ABSOLUTELY WRONG things (like trying to create some sort of nostalgic ""good old days"" ambiance with blurry sepia photos, & cheesy elevator music that in some/many ways, sounds like it came out of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oregon-Trail/dp/B0038HUV2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oregon Trail</a>&nbsp;computer game we played as kids in elementary school!) he neglected MANY of the BEST things (in my opinion!) about Paris! For example, unless I missed it (as mentioned above, I was NOT watching this movie with full concentration -- instead, it was just playing in the background while I did chores) from what I can tell, the film-maker ignored the fascinating variety of cultural enclaves/ethnic neighborhoods in Paris. Not only does Paris have a GREAT ""Chinatown"", but it also has a ""Little India"" enclave in ""La Chappelle"", and neighborhoods with themes of several other ethnicities (including, if I recall correctly, an Italian enclave [at Place d'Italie], a Jewish neighborhood [around the Avenue des Rosiers], a Vietnamese neighborhood, and many more!).

There are not many places in the world, where ALL IN THE SAME DAY, one can wake up to a hot cafe au lait & fresh-baked croissants (or crusty baguettes) from the neighborhood boulangerie, spend the morning visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe & the Champs de Elysees, and have a nice lunch of Pho at a restaurant in the Vietnamese enclave, before walking through the Indian neighborhood window-shopping and snacking on samosas & laddoos, in the afternoon, then heading to Chinatown and browsing through the Oriental markets there, finishing off with dinner in a Chinese restaurant, and finally ending the night with a scenic ""Bateau Mouche"" boat ride along the Seine river to see the night light scenery of Paris! The film maker also missed all the ""off-the-beaten-path"" GEMS of this city (like the many FABULOUS restaurants, patisseries/boulangeries [pastry shops & bakeries], cafes/bistros, as well as the WONDERFUL farmer's markets, parks & open-air markets) because he spent so much time focusing on the typical ""tourist spots"" of Paris (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, etc.)

Not only that, but at least a few of the claims that are made in this film, are misleading, if not outright FALSE!

For example, the film-maker recommends that people learn at least a few words of French, before traveling to Paris, claiming that it is difficult to get around the city without knowing French. Of course, it is always beneficial to know a 2nd language (or better yet, even a 3rd or 4th language!) and it is ALWAYS better to know at least a few basic words (hello, goodbye, please, thank you, ""Do you speak English?"", etc.) of the language in ANY foreign country you visit. However it is NOT difficult to get around in Paris if you speak little or even no French -- and I should know, because I spent 10 weeks there and other than ""bonjour"", ""au revoir"", ""s'il vous plait"", ""merci beaucoup"" and a few other words, I don't know any French (I took a few years of Spanish in high school, as well as about a year or so of Japanese). But yet with the exception of the REALLY ""off-the-beaten-path"" areas (and even there, a simple ""Parlez-vous Anglais?"", usually produced at least one person in the vicinity who spoke passable, even if somewhat broken English) of Paris, I was able to get along relatively fine -- specially in the more ""touristy"" areas of Paris, like the La Motte Picquet Grenelle area near the Eiffel Tower (where my first apartment was located) many people seem to speak English in addition to French & whatever other languages. So getting around was NO problem. So while, regardless, it is a good idea to learn at least a little French before visiting Paris, to claim that it is difficult to get around without knowing the language is MISLEADING!

Also, the film-maker states that the Metro system can be difficult to navigate, but that is FALSE!

As long as someone can read a map, using the Metro (or ANY mass transit system in Paris [Metro, bus, tram, RER, etc.] for that matter!) is NOT that difficult! As a matter of fact during the 10 weeks I spent in Paris, I found the Metro to be THE MOST CONVENIENT & MOST EFFICIENT form of travel that I have ever seen -- so much so that I wished I could just pick up the entire system and transplant it into my hometown! With hundreds of metro stations -- none (to my knowledge) more than a 10 to 15 minute walk from any location in Paris, and trains running constantly throughout the day & evening for 7 days a week (generally from 5 or 6 AM until 12 MIDNIGHT, or 1 AM on weekends) on a generally efficient schedule with Metro trains at least every 10 minutes, and during peak/busy hours as often as every 2 or 3 minutes, for the most part, NOBODY is more than 10-15 minutes away from a Metro NOR has to wait more than 10 minutes for a Metro train to ANYWHERE in the city! I ABSOLUTELY  LOVE  the Paris Metro!

Not only that but I also constantly wished (and still continue to wish -- even MORE SO now that I'm back in America) that Paris's public transportation system could be IDENTICALLY REPLICATED in EVERY area of the United States.  I'm unable to drive, and being able to get around (or the lack thereof!) with the minimal to non-existent public transportation where I live is a SHEER NIGHTMARE! In Paris it was INCREDIBLY LIBERATING to be able to just walk out my front door, almost ANY time of the day or night, hop on a Metro and go virtually ANYWHERE, even on the spur of the moment -- UNLIKE in this area. The Paris Metro is AWESOME and contrary to what the film claims, it is NOT at all difficult to use. In fact, the EXCELLENT public transit system is one of the many reasons that I  LOVE  Paris so much! It is also the MAIN reason I wish I could live in Paris, at least semi-permanently!

Paris is an ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, BEAUTIFUL & EXCITING city -- and nobody should let a truly GOD-AWFUL film like this influence their decision whether or not to go to Paris (if they were considering traveling there) because it would be a HUGE mistake!

4990428,1,B006HGXGP2,"I was hoping for a video that would communicate the beauty and richness of Paris to my students. Instead, I found this. I'm sure that the fuzzy focus and the sepia tones are intended to evoke a certain ambiance, but they fail miserably. Add to that the fact that the filmmaker(s) couldn't even bother to spell several of the names of places correctly (it's MONTMARTRE, not Montmarte!)... NOT something I'd recommend. Honestly, I made it through about 8 minutes of this drivel before shutting it off. Old photos of Charles de Gaulle Airport that look as if they were taken by spies attempting some sort of covert action and unconcerned with the clarity of their pictures. All in all, a dud.

4990434,3,B006HGXGP2,"'Paris France, The City of Magic', offered by WorldWide Multi-Media, gives a vintage picture postcard treatment to modern day Paris.  A decision was made to shoot all the video in soft-focus and saturated color or sepia tones.  Having visited Paris several times, I believe this was done to enable the viewer to gloss over any smog-begrimed buildings or to avoid giving a too literal view of the city.  This works, up to a point but it also left me wondering if I needed new glasses...

The program opens with some zippy 'cabaret accordion' music and continues with a variety of pleasant pieces that obviate the need for too explicit a presentation of information on each of the selected sites.  Most of the major attractions are covered but don't look to get 'off the beaten path' through this video.  A British English narrator gives a useful amount of basic information about each attraction in a pleasant manner but there are no stunning insights or surprises on offer.  Parks, Monuments, Cemetaries, the Louvre and Monte Martre are given fairly thorough looks that encourage the eye to linger over facades and the occaisional interior.  This is not a tour by the 'Energizer Rabbit' or Rick Steves as far as speed goes; neither does this video offer the depth of insight and information found in the Rick Steves video products.  One is left with the golden glow of somewhat incomplete memory, just like souvenir photos and happy memories.  This is one to look at from time to time once you get home.",1353542400,5,1503,4.790697674418604

8498503,5,B006HGXGP2,"As a RELAXATION film = 5-STARS. As a PARIS GUIDE = 3.5 STARS. But I did enjoy it -- especially the French Cafe music!

This is an artsy 54-minute medley of footage, stills and music. It might be years old, or just made to look that way, with its sepia tinted footage. Film is often shown with music only, no narration, and sometimes they fast forward: cars zoom around Place de la Concorde; people walk at a rapid clip making them look like Weebles.

Narration, by a Brit named John Symes who has a most calming tone of voice, is abbreviated; he speaks only about half of the time. But he does manage to inform visitors about sightseeing highlights, including history and culture, and some practical tips, in spite of the trimmed narration.

He begins with your arrival at CDG and suggests you take the RoissyBus. (I took it once. I found it to be inexpensive and convenient, since I was staying at a Best Western a few of blocks away from the Paris Opera Garnier.) He also mentions the train and taxis; but taxis can be expensive. One great tip is to google the bus map and print it out, since they're hard to come by. Another is to wear comfortable shoes and walk everywhere.

""Must See"" places: Eiffel Tower, Louvre (plan to spend a whole day), Carousel under the Louvre to buy Louvre tickets and shop for French souvenirs, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Sacre Coeur (I like his tip on watching the sunset from here and visiting Montmartre in the evening), Pompidou Center, Moulin Rouge, Invalides, Palais de Luxembourg, Pantheon (I agree -- a must see! though a bit out of the way), Tuileries Gardens, Grand Palais (the Nazis used it for their tanks during WW2 -- I didn't know this), Forum des Halles for shopping (but he really prefers Carousel), walk along the Seine, go to the theatre (but beware -- it will be in French!). They show Bourse, but don't identify it. They show the inside of Opera Garnier, but don't tell you what you're looking at.

When he bemoans the fact that one can't get a cup of real English tea, he says it ""tongue in cheek,"" I think, and isn't really crying over the fact that English tea isn't served with milk in France, if at all. He recommends orange juice, instead. He points out that Parisians are beautiful to look at (true!), and he says about Paris: it's one of those places it would be a shame not to visit. I so agree!",1449100800,,2374,4.4734411085450345
