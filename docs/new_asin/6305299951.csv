1006162,4,6305299951,"Of the 160 ""Avengers"" episodes telecast since its inception (recorded on 1/61) to the last of the Tara King entries (5/69), numbers 41-128 are now available from A&E on tape and DVD. This means we have almost all of the Cathy Gale's and all of the Diana Rigg's, which is saying a lot! The latest entry in this series is <Avengers '63, Sets 3 and 4> that give us those telecasts starting with ""Intercrime"" (1/63) and ending with ""Brief for Murder""(5/63).
  In reviewing the other sets, I stated that we must judge these older offerings on their own merits without comparing them unfairly with what was to come when Rigg took over. Here we must even forget the more fanciful Honor Blackman episodes that began after the ones included in these sets; for indeed many of these are pretty cut and dry detective plots without much imaginative development or even witty dialogue. (An exception is a female character's claiming  that in her act she does ""interesting things with stuffed snakes""!)
  The best one of all is the last, which is really the opening of the third Avengers season. Here we have Steed apparently involved in treason and then in a murder, the latter being that of Cathy Gale. Since we simply KNOW that the whole thing has to be a put up, the suspense is minimal. However the acting is the smoothest of all the episodes in these sets, special thanks given to John Laurie and Harold Scott, who play two lawyer brothers determined to make legal history in a way that followers of the O.J. murder trial will find very up to date.
  Some of the telecasts find Julie Stevens as Venus Smith in place of Honor Blackman; and I for one found myself fast forwarding through the two obligatory songs she was given in each of her appearances. As always, the chemistry between Steed and Gale is never that between Steed and Peel. Gale seems to display more annoyance than admiration for him; and frankly I do find his character a little too cocky,  enough to make me agree with her.
  It is always fun to spot actors who will appear in future episodes or as stars in their own right in the years after these shows were recorded. We have a very young Paul Eddington (""The Good Neighbors,"" ""Yes, Minister""), Philip Latham (the Rigg episode ""Room Without a View"" and the series ""The Pallisers"")--to name only two.
  Still, there is enough enjoyment in these old telecasts, which (by the way) seem to have a better picture and sound quality than early issues of later shows; but still with occasional blurring and jumping, much of which I suspect is in the original tapes, and now and then fuzzy sound, due mostly to the accents.",988502400,16,2625,4.609442060085837

1006201,5,6305299951,"I was introduced to ""The Avengers"" via A&E television as a Navy fleet band musician in the late 1980s, and haven't turned back since. Up until 7 years ago my favorite was Dame Diana's Emma Peel. But I believe this post-modern generation would best respond to Honor Blackman's Cathy Gale, and the Cathy-Steed relationship. While Tara and Steed were lovers, and Steed and Emma had the ""Did they or didn't they?"" relationship, I refer to Cathy-Steed's relationship as the ""7-year hitch"": no fluff, no silliness, no pretense; a REAL man-woman, in-your-face ADULT relationship. And the 1962-63 episodes contain ADULT, anti-terrorist, secret-agent situations. Add to this Patrick Macnee's Steed is hard-hitting, barely respectable, arrogant - and gorgeous! - plus Honor Blackman's no-nonsense, ""take-no-mess,"" ""hands-off-while-I-wear-my-leather,"" and the dynamic is knockout, TV-PG (i.e., language, innuendo, etc.), hard-hitting entertainment. If you're expecting the goofiness of the Emma-Tara series, yes: you'll be disappointed. But if you can get over the ABC camera and video quality issues, and adapt a pre-21st-century sit-and-watch-TV attitude, you'll be truly able to WATCH, LISTEN and ENJOY pre ""Goldfinger"" Honor Blackman blazing the trail for every female gun-slinging, man-throwing TV woman since. Ladies of ""Leverage,"" ""Law & Order,"" ""X-Files""...give ""Honor"" the honor she is truly due! - and enjoy the historic journey.",1373587200,4,1428,5.7725118483412325

1006231,4,6305299951,"As ""The Avengers"" progressed through 1963, the series had turned from pairing John Steed with a rotating set of partners to (usually) being paired with Honor Blackman (""Cathy Gale."")  The episodes with Honor Blackman make these sets well worth watching for their stylish drama and repartee. Episodes with other costars aren't bad, it's just that Blackman is such a strong stage presence she melds well with Patrick Macnee making any episode she's in very entertaining.
Audio and video quality are limited due to the times, but don't let that stop you. Blackman in my opinion was the best Steed partner of them all and that's saying a lot because Diana Rigg was wonderful in the series as well after Blackman left.",1347667200,,713,4.892561983471074

1006261,5,6305299951,"While all of the episode on this DVD are terrific, A Funny Thing Happened on The Way to The Station stands above all.  If you like trains, this story is for you. Virtually the whole episode takes place on a train or on train platforms, with compartments, dining car, and even the engineer's car.  Full of witty dialogue, such as Steed's ""pop goes the diesel"" when the villain explains to him his intention of blowing up the prime ministers car; and strangeness, a groom who hums ""here comes the bride"" before gunning people down.

Speaking of Steed, I can't verify this but Patrick Macnee must have been on holiday during filming of the second half of this story, because he disappears about 20 minutes in and isn't seen again until the very end.  It's explained in the plot that he was captured and held hostage by the villains. Steed's role is taken over by railway loving eccentric Crewe, played by John Laurie, who acts as Emma's sidekick in helping bring down the enemy.  A terrific actor, John Laurie will definitely remind the viewer of Christopher Lloyd's professor character in Back To The Future, in character as well as in looks.

Also, a very subtle reference to how The Avengers was at the time being written with an American Audience in mind.  Steed discovers a clue, a slip of paper bearing the numbers ""4-7-67"". Emma thinks a minute and blurts out, ""July 4, 1967?, Independence Day!"", before the revelation of the actual meaning of those numbers.  It's unlikely that a simple reference to an American holiday, especially Independence Day, would have slipped in the series in the grainy, black & white videotape days.

We also get a hint of Steed & Peel's political leanings.  The prime minister in question, by all accounts, is labor party Harold Wilson, who was prime minister of Britain at the time.  Steed and Mrs. Peel during the tag scene quip to each other that they didn't vote for him, and quietly sneak out the back. Tories til the end. Gotta love it. As if we didn't already know.",1214611200,6,2006,4.670454545454546

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211846400,,629,5.463917525773196
1006263,5,6305299951,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement!

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this is ""Set No. 3,"" color-coded GREEN), is just one of FOUR sets which take in all the 1967 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

1967 was Diana Rigg's last season as Steed's partner. Her career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier, '63 and '64) partners until many years later.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.

Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from a killer nanny to a mind-transfer device!

Here, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes.

Volume 5:

""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station"" -- British agents are killed as they try to get to the bottom of suspicious activities on a mysterious train car. Steed and Mrs. Peel must act quickly to resolve the issue because the Prime Minister is about to take a train ride. A great episode.

""Something Nasty in the Nursery"" -- A child's ball becomes a deadly  instrument of espionage. The balls are treated with a chemical that makes people revert to their early youths -- and they're used on British officials, all of whom have lots of top secret stories to tell! Surreptitious and furtive activities seem to be centered at a local school for nannies. It's here that Steed discovers that he's a less-than-adequate baby-sitter, which gets pointed out to him by Mrs. Peel. There are some really malicious nannies at this place!

""The Joker"" -- A maniac enemy of Steed and Mrs. Peel has escaped prison and is out for vengeance! Mrs. Peel writes an astute article for a bridge players' magazine and an old, renowned bridge player, a certain ""Sir Cavalier,"" is so impressed that he invites her to his isolated manor house for the weekend. Once there, she finds Sir Cavalier gone and then faces more than one lunatic who is set on killing her. An attempt on Steed's life is narrowly averted but he's barred in getting to Mrs. Peel's aid due to a heavy fog. This is about the darkest and creepiest Avengers episode I've ever viewed.

Volume 6:

""Who's Who???"" -- Minds get traded in this unusual ""sci-fi"" episode. A shrewd but evil professor invents a ""mind transfer machine,"" and a male and female swarthy duo of spies lure in Steed and Mrs. Peel. Once the mind transfers have taken place and the spies are using the bodies of the two Avengers, they attempt to obtain all the secret information that Steed's and Mrs. Peel's smiling faces will gain them access to. But Steed and Mrs. Peel are not about to allow these two second-rate thugs to misuse their excellent bodies.

""Return of the Cybernauts"" -- Remember those nasty, destructive Cybernauts back from the early Avengers black-and-white days? Well, the darned pesky things are back! Since the original evil inventor was killed, thanks to Steed and Mrs. Peel, the two are stumped now as to who could be behind producing the high-tech, dangerous robots again. In the meantime, important scientists are going missing and some are even turning up dead! And who stars as the evil inventor this time? It's the BROTHER of the original inventor and he wants ecstatic revenge against Steed and Mrs. Peel. This ""mechanical Frankenstein"" show is even further enhanced as the great Peter Cushing is cast in the role of the evil brother! You won't want to miss this superb ""sequel"" episode.

""Death's Door"" -- An important international diplomatic conference is suddenly disrupted when the British diplomats experience prophetic nightmares that they're going to die... and then they DO die! Steed and Mrs. Peel are also nearly killed as a result of the evil goings-on in ""Nightmare Alley"".

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.

I've reviewed all the '65, '66, and '67 sets so you can check the appropriate sites for details of each episode. In the meantime, this particular set garners my highest recommendation!",1211846400,5,5940,4.859545004945598
1006264,5,6305299951,"I bought this set on the basis of ""Who's Who???"", a classic laugh-out-loud color episode, with a fantastic opening sequence (check out Steed and Emma's discovery of the evil spies' first victim, ""Rose"" Hooper), marvelous byplay between Macnee and Rigg, and a to-die-for performance by the incomparable Freddie Jones, who almost outclasses Macnee as John Steed, if you can believe that! The plot is absurd, the action non-stop, and the dialogue some of the wittiest of the series. And, even better, there are several more classics on this set, including the extremely bizarre ""Something Nasty in the Nursery"", complete with machine gun toting nannies! I don't think The Avengers ever got any more surreal (or better) than they are on this group of episodes.",1206316800,2,756,5.104838709677419
1006265,5,6305299951,"Third set for 1967, this series is fully established with dapper John Steed, and sexy but very capable Mrs. Peel.  The trademark wit and tongue-through-cheek continues with these episodes:

1) ""A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Station"" - ""Steed goes off the rails - and Emma finds her station in life"" has out super sleuths trying to foil an assassination of the Queen.

2) ""Something Nasty in the Nursery"" - ""Steed Acquires a Nanny - and Emma shops for toys""  Emma and Steed must stop nasty nannies with deadly toys in a plot to take over Britain

3) ""The Joker"" - ""Steed trumps an ace - and Emma plays a lone hand"" has Emma lured to a remote house where an escape lunatic plans to murder her.  He does not count on Steed riding to her rescue

4) ""Who's Who???"" - ""Steed goes out of his mind - and Emma is beside herself"" a quirky episode that has a master criminal switching the minds of Steed and Mrs. Peel with two ""common"" agents, showing you cannot judge a book or an agent by their cover!

5) Return of the Cybernauts - ""Steed pulls some strings - Emma becomes a puppet"" is the sequel to The Cybernauts.  In this episode, beloved veteran horror actor Peter Cushing plays the brother to the mad scientist (Michael Gough) and is seeking his revenge on Emma and Steed.  He has perfected the Cybernaut process to where a person wearing a watch becomes a human cybernaut.

6) ""Death's Door"" - ""Steed relives a nightmare - and Emma sees Daylight"" has dream-influencing drugs used to disrupt an important conference.  Important conference members suddenly start having clairvoyant experiences of impending doom stopping them from attending the meetings.
