8207830,2,B000T4SX38,"This documentary covers the Eastern front from autumn 1941 to autumn 1942.  Its highlight is the interview with Professor John Erickson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Stalingrad-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304365416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Berlin-Stalin-s-War-with-Germany-Volume-II-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304365408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Berlin (Stalin's War with Germany Volume II) (Cassell Military Paperbacks)</a>) rather than the footage and its narration.

The documentary starts with the onset of the Rasputitsa (""time without roads"" literally) in mid-October 1941 and covers the winter related problems (poor clothing, freezing oil, fuel and firing mechanisms) of the Wehrmacht until their final assault 15 km in front of Moscow on 1 December 41 followed by the Soviet counteroffensive which pushed them back 100 km west of Moscow by the end of the year.  It then covers Operation ""Blau"" (the drives to the Don and the Volga and in the Caucasus) until the end of November, when, as Erickson puts it, the Germans were about 400 yards from winning Stalingrad.  It does not cover the defeat of 6th Army and parts of 4th Panzer Army.

As a side note, Erickson clearly condemns the Wehrmacht in general and von Manstein in particular for the atrocities committed in the East.

The documentary is quite deficient, most notably from a muddled timeline, especially before operation Blau.  The interview with Erickson is not properly synchronized with the footage and its narration, often with a one year discrepancy.  For example, when the footage deals with the Moscow counter offensive in December 1941, Erickson discusses the `not one step back' order by Stalin: that order, specifically number 227, ""ni shagu nazad', was issued on 28 July 1942, in context of Blau, not of Moscow.  The documentary stipulates that 1.5 million died in the defense of Moscow alone but that figure seems high, at least when compared to figures from other sources.  Table A of Glantz's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Titans-Clashed-How-the-Red-Army-Stopped-Hitler-Modern-War-Studies/dp/0700608990/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler (Modern War Studies)</a>&nbsp;indicates 926,002 killed or missing Red Army personnel during 4th quarter 1941 on all fronts, not just Moscow, and Table B indicates 514,338 killed or wounded during the Moscow defense (30 Sept-5 Nov) and 139,586 killed or wounded during the Moscow counteroffensive (5 Dec-7 Jan).  During Blau, the battle of Rostov is described but that at Kharkov is not.

There are better documentaries available, for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Russia-The-Eastern-Front-3-DVD-Set/dp/B003XQRZ56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Russia: The Eastern Front! 3 DVD Set!</a>",1328140800,,3103,6.847715736040609
8207831,3,B000T4SX38,"I enjoyed the dvd to some degree, but to get the most updated info on what went on, I recommend documentaries that were made after the fall of the Soviet Union - post 1990. You get never before released files from the BBC Laurence Rees series ""Stalin: Behind Closed Doors"" and ""War of the Century - Hitler and Stalin"". As an American, I find the BBC is more inclined to give you a more objective look at what really happened and with less propaganda than some American influenced productions. The ""World at War"" (a British production)series is very good, but was made in 1972 and doesn't have the post 1990 Russian info that wasn't available prior to the current ""open door"" Soviet policy. Many of the Stalin atrocities were never admitted to previously.",1278460800,,754,4.676691729323308
8207832,3,B000T4SX38,The DVD was informative. Yet it did not provide the type of information I required. A better DVD is the World at War series.,1210550400,6,124,4.208333333333333
8207833,2,B000T4SX38,This DVD is a good but superficial review of the Battle of Stalingrad.  The film of the weather conditions and the fighting is gripping but I have seen it elsewhere.  If you are interested in this battle or anything related to WWII my advice is that you not buy this DVD.  Instead pool your giftcards and buy the masterpiece World At War collection.,1201046400,12,349,4.507936507936508
