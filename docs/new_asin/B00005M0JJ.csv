1623594,5,B00005M0JJ,"i was terrified that the cartoon could never be as good as the book but i must admit i was pleasantly surprised. some of the subtle nuances of the written word are lost but you also gain sight gags and facial expressions. also, you get to compare the artists' vision of characters and places with your own; the same with the voices.
the setting was well done. it was pretty much what i'd imagined: twisty, turny and in complete denial of the laws of physics. cheers.
as far as characters go, they really did a great job. death had me the most worried. how do you do the voice of a guy who TALKS LIKE THIS? but they did it and they did it well. imp y ceylon was a good composite of the more popular brit-rock stars with a pretty decent singing voice and the decision to make cliff sound like an old jazz man was brilliant. the animation was a bit simple (or so it seemed at first) but it really worked. there were some pretty creative shots and angles used that made the most of a simplistic style. i was also concerned that the music would be generic tv sitcom rock but i found myself wishing for a soundtrack. the songs eren't parodies, per se, but they were strongly reminiscent of music you know. each concert is a different sound: the stones, the beatles, jimi hendrix; it's all in there. but the one shining moment is hearing Buddy announce ""we're more popular than cheeses."" probably the finest animated moment ever.
if you pass up a chance to see this you're making a big big mistake.",999043200,6,1491,4.366906474820144
1623595,4,B00005M0JJ,"Soul Music is one of my favourite Discworld books ever (it's a comedy fantasy series that takes place on a flat planet) and I must say that this animated version was pretty decent.  The story of Soul Music, basically, is that Death, while trying to ""FORGET"", runs off, leaving his grand-daughter Susan (don't ask) to do his job--whether she wants to or not!  Meanwhile, a young bard named Imp goes to the city and joins up with a dwarf named Glod and a troll named Lias to start a music band.  He finds a strange guitar in a mysterious wandering shop.  It seems to play of itself...
Imp is destined to die on stage during the band's first gig, but Susan--as Death--doesn't WANT him to die! (He's a cute teenage boy, she's a teenage girl...) Before _she_ can save him, though, something _else_ does...
...and _rock and roll_ breaks loose in a _medieval_ society! This causes about as much chaos as you might expect, and the rock-fan wizards among other things, are just about the FUNNIEST thing you could think of.  This story--the original book, especially--pokes fun at just about _every_ rock or pop cliche of the genre you can think of.  Examples include a song called ""Pathway to Paradise"", the Dean with his leather robe that says ""BORN TO RUNE"" and a _new_ twist on the idea of a rock star ""redecorating his hotel room.""  The musical jokes are HILARIOUS, but you will only get them if you know about rock history!  Those of you whose knowledge only goes as far back as Britney Spears and 98 Degrees--you won't get it.  (Me, I wasn't born in the '50s or '60s, but I have good _taste_, see. ;))
However, ""Soul Music"" also has its serious side: The story with Death, Susan, and Mort and Ysabell is very tragic and parts of it will have you sniffling.  The frailty of human life and the inability to change your fate are big themes here, and they give the comedy a solid emotional underpinning; they save it from being mere fluff.  And Imp the bard is now living fast; will he die young?  Wait and see...
Did I mention that he renames himself ""Buddy""?  Um, not the best omen...
Now, for the animated version:  It wasn't perfect; I really did not like the way they did the wizards, a lot of the best jokes from the book weren't included--but to balance that, you get to actually HEAR ""Music With Rocks In"" _songs_...something the book could only TELL you about, in words.  They are really catchy and sound just like real, legitimate songs off the radio (BETTER than many, actually...) and...yes, there IS a soundtrack album!  Hard to find, but worth it. :)  (My favourites are the _extremely_ catchy ""Cover Girl"", the early-Beatles-esque ""She Won't Change Her Mind"" and the rather dark ""The Messenger"", among others.)
In short, if you like fantasy, if you like to laugh, and if you like rock and roll, buy this DVD!  You'll be glad you did.",997747200,14,2841,4.559055118110236
1623596,4,B00005M0JJ,"Finally this gem of animated antics in the strange world of Discworld comes is avaliable in the US. This DVD is ecxcellent! A must-have for fans of Terry Pratchetts' works... The story is excellent, the animations are very nice, and extremely true to the Discworld universe, and the music is exquisite! (Wich they'd release a soundtrack ;)  The only thing I found disapointing in this release is the option of watching the entire series in one go, instead of having to watch the end-credits after each episode, and then manually choose the next one... But that's only nit-picking. Conclusion: Get this DVD right now! You will not regret it...",997056000,5,642,4.889908256880734
1623597,4,B00005M0JJ,"While this is not a PERFECT rendition of ""Soul Music""--one of my very favourite Discworld books, ever--it's still pretty fun.  First, to get it out of the way--the bad news.  Some of the best running gags, such as the rock-fan wizards and the punk/garage band that kept changing its name, are shortened down considerably for time purposes.  I didn't like the way they drew the wizards.  And well, this really couldn't be helped, but things that were supposed to be just _feelings_ in the book, were translated into rather cheesy special effects. (Like the ""energy"" coming out of Imp's guitar and coursing through his body, for example.) But I guess that's the only way you CAN let the audience know what's going on, in a visual medium.  It seemed more realistic/less cheesy in print, though.  I should also mention that since this is probably my VERY favourite Discworld novel, I was judging it a little more closely than I might have otherwise.  Other people might react differently.
Now, the GOOD!  This cartoon miniseries does stay pretty dang close to the actual plot of the book--using original dialogue whenever it can, even.  It includes the types of details and scenes that MOST movies-based-off-of-books would have clipped out.  Susan and Imp the bard are especially well-drawn, I thought, and DEATH is, of course, just the way he should be.  Also, the Music With Rocks In songs are _catchy_!
Overall, this video is an enjoyable time.  It'll make people who _aren't_ familiar with Discworld yet want to learn more--and those of us who are already fans of those hilariously funny fantasy books should enjoy the chance to _see_ one of them on the screen.",995932800,17,1661,4.871886120996441
1623598,5,B00005M0JJ,"Greetings fellow Diskworld fans and first timers, if you only own one DVD this needs to be the one. My wife and I are very big Pratchett Fans and this DVD goes well with our collection of Diskworld items. Having read the book 'Soul music' cover to cover many times I was hoping the animated version would stay close to home, and for the most part it does this very well. There are just a few little things that did not make it to the DVD but all in all this DVD is Great! I will be watching it years from now! It stays VERY close to the book, and it leaves you praying for the next installment of animated features. I was very happy to hear the voice of Death was the same for 'Wyrd Sisters'. This disk also contains a great interview with Terry Pratchett himself.",995846400,11,764,4.168918918918919
1623599,4,B00005M0JJ,"As a Terry Pratchett fan, I eagerly awaited the arrival of ""Soul Music"" and I wasn't disappointed! The story was true to the book, and very entertaining. Mainly it's a story of Death's attempts to forget,and his granddaughter's attempt to fill his shoes. While Susan is filling in for death, she meets a boy whose death is averted by music. She than tries to figure out the how and why, and what to do next. Sounds confusing, but my husband, who doesn't follow the discworld, could keep up with it. I only have two complaints that keep it from  receiving a perfect score. One, they used the same animators that did ""Wyrd Sisters"" so the animation seemed almost from the 1970's (someone compared it to the animation for Fat Albert!)and dated, and two, it was not a seamless story. The DVD version was broken into episodes . I found it distracting to get into the story and to have that episode end, and then have to go to the menu to choose the next one. The extras;howerver, were fabulous. They include an interview with Terry Pratchett, a copy of the pilot (which seemed to be based on the beginning of Reaper Man), a story board break down of one of the scenes, and more. If you like Terry Pratchett, or even writers such as Douglas Adams, this is a fabulous disc!! (pardon the pun, I couldn't help myself!)",995673600,20,1309,4.5
1623600,5,B00005M0JJ,"I must say, with all the negative reviews that this animation was getting, I was almost afraid to watch it. But my insistance on seeing Death animated persuaded me to buy it anyways, and I'm glad for it. So I will address some of the main negative commentary. First, the quality of animation. Perhaps I've become desensitized to bad animation (thanks to some low-budget Japanese anime) but in my experience, Soul Music's animation is not at all bad. If anyone could stomach Scooby-Doo or Johnny Quest, then this is nothing. The adaptation itself (while I would rather have seen Reaper Man or Mort animated) was exquisite and followed the novel almost exactly. Sometimes the cuts or execution of a particular scene in the novel didn't translate exactly, but for the most part seeing it in action actually clarified aspects of the book. I was particularly impressed by how well things such as Death's house and time travel were handled. And finally, the voice acting was very well done. Christopher Lee as Death was a piece of casting that could not have been done better, not to mention the design overall was done well! Susan, although her character design fluctuated a lot, was also very good. The musical aspect of the story -- going through all the 'stages' of rock music since it started -- was handled surprisingly well also.

The only gripe I had was the fact that the Death of Rats didn't have a rat skull. Nor did he, er, SQUEAK properly. He looked more like a Death of Lizards. And Quoth didn't really look much like  a raven, and talked more like a parrot. But otherwise, everything was spot-on.",1108512000,49,1605,4.708185053380783
1623601,5,B00005M0JJ,"This is the coolest animation rendition of any story I've read! The voice acting leaves nothing to be desired (yes, Death will blow you away), the plot flows more smoothly than the book (in fact it's more understandable than the book). The animation, while not exactly disney-standard, does the job of telling the story perfectly well. Just don't buy it from marketsales, I bought it there and waited some 30 days for it to arrive (and they only found out it's on backorder after I emailed them), but in the end it's well worth the wait!",1078272000,2,537,4.604166666666667
1623602,2,B00005M0JJ,"I consider myself a fanatic Discworld fan, and was really looking forward to the seeing this (and the Wyrd Sisters animation). Boy, what a disappointment. The animation is way down there with Pokemon. And overly exaggagerated british dialects aren't all that funny either. To bungle this when the books are so good is a [...] crime.
Save your money and pray to the gods that: 1) The guys who made this never gets to make another one. 2) When the movie comes, the real movie, it is made a lot better than this.",1062115200,6,509,4.483870967741935
1623603,4,B00005M0JJ,"This is the animated version of the discworld book 'soul music'.  It will make more sense if you've read the book (not that discworld ever makes sense, it's just internally consistant, and consistantly inconsistant).  But if you've read the book you'll spot the things they had to leave out for space: like all the blues brothers jokes (no 'we're on a mission for Glod')
The animations not bad and the sound track is pretty good too.  But if you're hoping that the animated Susan resembles the girl with the great figure on the cover of the Harper Priam published version of the book, you'll be disappointed.  On the other hand, I now get the joke about Buddy looking Elvish.
It was fun to watch but having read the book several times it seemed a little short for all the things they had to leave out.",1052438400,8,801,4.503448275862069
1623604,4,B00005M0JJ,"The story has remained faithful with the book--even letting Death wail on the guitar!  The animation is no Disney cartoon series nor is it as smooth as ""The Flight of Dragons"" but the truth of the matter is that a devoted reader could forego these minor details because it IS a good story that will make you laugh that you will, as I paraphrase the author: Be a prime candidate for the rubber room with the white jacket with the optional canvass sleeves.  I have to agree with the writer when he says that his job is to write the books and it is our jobs to fill in the soundtrack and the special effects all in our heads.  Surely, there will definitely be a better way of presenting Discworld.  It is just a great relief just to finally see a really good book in moving pictures (and I hope that pun makes it into a third animation).",1050883200,2,834,4.2594936708860756
1623605,4,B00005M0JJ,"If you've read the book and you're a Pratchett fan then I believe you will enjoy this. It keeps the spirt of his books, characters and dialog. I believe it's close to three hours total and truthfully I would have liked it to have been even longer. I was a bit sad when it was completed.
Cons? Well, the dvd itself. All episodes are broken down which wouldn't be so bad if you just had the option to continue on. You don't though. You have to go back to the menu, episode listing, select the episode, fast forward through the opening...It gets a bit tiredsome when you just want to watch several straight through.
The animation is rather bad. I've REALLY tried to think of it as ""stylized"" so as to forgive much of it but I failed.
That being said. Would I buy it again knowing the above in advance? Yes, yes I would. I anxiously await to see if other titles will be featured as well.",1041033600,4,883,4.261904761904762
1623606,5,B00005M0JJ,"The creators of the two Pratchett cartoons have done a splendid job of transferring Pratchett's works to the screen.
Not only have they preserved the character of the original, but by adding original music, voice characterisation, and a lot of visual references to the Rock scene, they have, in some respects, enhanced it. For an example of what I mean, just watch and listen to Lias/Cliff the troll.
Read the book first, though.",1037923200,,429,4.890410958904109
1623607,3,B00005M0JJ,"...because the voice acting is mostly great, some of the art design -- like that of Cliff's character -- is superb, and the music nicely skewers the whole broad sweep of early rock in what's simultaneously a swift kick and a respectful nod.
But the animation is awful. Awful. Mind-numbingly bad. And it's a real shame, because the ART is pretty good.
In other words, you have these very nicely painted -- if occasionally quirky -- renditions of classic Discworld characters, mostly very well-realized, that unfortunately happen to stutter and jerk and lurch and blink their way through the quirky and nicely-painted backgrounds. Honestly, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons with more fluid animation.
If you can get past that, though, perhaps through the useful expedient of being blind or choosing to play the series while sitting beneath a strobe light, the episodes are a genuine pleasure -- and remarkably close to the source material.
(Note: I say ""episodes"" throughout because, in a somewhat unusual design decision, each of the various episodes of the series is stored on the DVD independently; you'll probably tire of the CGI opening sequence by the third or fourth episode, no matter HOW much you love Great Atuan.)",1034726400,4,1225,5.069306930693069
1623608,4,B00005M0JJ,"If there was any Discworld novel that desperately needed to be translated to screen, it was ""Soul Music.""  Terry Pratchett is a great writer, but it is nearly impossible to convey the experience of a rock concert (or rather, a Music With Rocks In concert) using words alone.  You need to hear and see it for yourself in order to get the full effect.
Now, at last, you can.  When Buddy, Cliff and Glod explode onto the music scene, you can feel it happening.  The loud music, the screaming fans, and the hip swinging ""elvish"" rock star - it's all there, larger than life and adds so much to the story.  I had read the original book a number of times (I've read all the discworld books a number of times - I'm that sad), but I truly felt like I was experiencing the story anew.  Keith Hopwood and the folks at Pluto music did a FANTASTIC job with the music - creating songs that remind you of great artists like the Beatles and Hendrix without completely imitating them.  (""Good Lovin'"" - an homage to the Blues Brothers, had me grinning and tapping my feet).  You won't be able to get enough of the musical numbers - and it's a darn shame that they don't play their music for long enough.
Animation-wise, ""Soul Music"" is nothing special, but that's a small quibble.  If you've seen the other Discworld film, ""Wyrd Sisters,"" you'll know what to expect.  This film is more concerned with story and character than the visual ""wow"" factor.  However, the artists still manage to do a great job.  Bird's-eye views of the city, long, empty trails leading off into the distance, and crowded concert halls all manage to convey a great sense of scope and space.  The animation isn't Disney or even Dreamworks quality, but you won't find yourself caring.
Now we come to the voice work.  I'm sorry there's no way to sugar-coat this.  It's a mixed bag.  The voices range from perfect to merely good to ear-numbingly bad.  The main characters are voiced pretty well.  I liked listening to Buddy and Cliff, and Susan was nice to listen to as well.  Christopher Lee, once again, does a FANTASTIC job as Death.  And the wizards' voices, frankly, are AWFUL.  They sound like young men making their voices squeaky to sound like old men.  And, unfortunately, you'll be hearing them a lot.  Especially the Dean.  Ugh.  Keep some cotton swabs handy in case your ears start bleeding.  Ridcully's voice is very well done, though - deep and booming, just as he's portrayed in the books.
Don't let the spotty voice work stop you from nabbing this video (even if I had to dock the movie 1 star because of it).  Christopher Lee and the excellent rock concert scenes made this a must-buy, especially if you're a Pratchett fan.",1032825600,10,2696,4.5625
1623609,4,B00005M0JJ,"""Soul Music"" features plenty of Discworld's most popular character: Death, the efficient-but-not-nasty Grim Reaper of Discworld. Full of jokes about ""Music With Rocks In"" and in-jokes about Discworld, this is a delight for kids and adults alike.
Ysobell and Mort Sto Helit die in a tragic carriage accident, leaving their teenage daughter Susan (Debra Gillett ) at a stodgy girls' academy in Anhk-Morpork. But unknown to Susan, they were also the adopted daughter and son-in-law of Death himself (Christopher Lee). Death is depressed by the loss of Ysobell and Mort, and at the advice of a slightly befuddled wise man, he takes leave of his duties in an effort to forget. His manservant Albert, a talking raven, and the Death Of Rats recruit the unwitting Susan to fill Death's place until he can be found. While Death gets drunk and joins the Klatchian Foreign Legion, Susan struggles to deal with the dead.
Elsewhere on the Disc, a young aspiring bard named Imp Y Celyn (Andy Hockley) leaves his dreary home for Anhk-Morpork, intending to become the greatest musician in the world. After gaining two bandmates (a dwarf named Glod and a troll named Lias Bluestone), earning the displeasure of the Music Guild, and losing his harp, Imp Y Celyn finds a magical guitar that produces amazing music -- by taking over all the musicians on the stage. The music (""Music With Rocks In"") soon takes the Disc by storm. At the same time, Susan finds that Imp Y Celyn is supposed to die very shortly -- but something in the magic guitar doesn't want him to die. And, it turns out, neither does she...
The other Discworld production, ""Wyrd Sisters,"" was extremely entertaining, but ""Soul Music"" surpasses it by having deeper issues in it, as well as the funny ones. Why do humans die? Is it better to die after a human life than an immortal, inhuman one? Interspersed are many old favorites such as the wizard-turned-ape Librarion, Colon and Nobby, Death of Rats, Albert, Binky the horse, Ridcully and his wizards at the Unseen University (Ridcully is the only one who hates Music With Rocks In), and many others. For rock aficionados, there are jokes about Elvis, the Sex Pistols, the Beatles, Buddy Holly, and many, many others.
Christopher Lee mixes the sublime and the funny as Death: he's alternately menacing (the time-travel scene where he menaces Mort), melancholy (the scene where he tries to explain to Susan why he couldn't save her parents), and outrageously funny, like the scenes where he is drunk, driving a motorcycle (""Oh bugger!""), or arguing with a wise man about the infinite (""What did it look like?"" ""It's blue."" ""It's black."" ""It's BLUE."" ""It's BLACK!"" ""From the outside, it's blue!""). Debra Gillet does a pretty good job with the difficult role of Susan, who initially seems very cold and unsympathetic, but gradually is revealed to be an ordinary girl with extraordinary abilities. Andy Hockley plays Buddy/Imp Y Celyn as a pleasant young man in the throes of an obsession, developing an unnatural link to his soul-sapping guitar. His two bandmates Lias and Glod are good foils for Imp Y Celyn, with Lias as the voice of straightforward reason and Glod the more cynical, twisted mind, but both of them good at heart. And any parents will sympathize with the frustrated Ridcully, who has to deal with a University full of music-crazed wizards, who are acting like unusually immature teenagers.
The animation is also slightly better than in ""Wyrd Sisters."" While it still has something of a crude quality, it remains more consistent from one to the next. One thing that may annoy viewers (and the DVD's biggest flaw) is that each part takes the viewer back to the menu rather than proceeding to the next part. Additionally, ""recap"" snippets and opening credits are present before every part, rather than just the first.
However, technical issues aside, this is a hilarious and touching story about life, death, Death, fate, magic, music, and Music With Rocks In. A must-see.",1028851200,12,3984,4.91246290801187

What makes this series unique is the fact that it is a comidic fantasy series that is not directed toward children.  Making anything from this series into a cartoon takes it closer to the realm of children's fiction.  However, a well done cartoon could still draw an adult audience.  The problem with this cartoon is that it is not well done.  The librarian looks as if it were animated by someone who still hasn't ever even had an orangutan described to him, and the wizards defy the discriptions given in the books.  Nobody has a colored upper lip, and Susan, who should be skinny to the point of being nearly skeletal herself, is slightly overweight.  Althought the soundtrack is a nice touch, you may find yourself embarrased to watch this movie with people not well-read in the series itself.  Even the discworld games are better.

7944468,3,B00005M0JJ,"Terry Pratchett's books are among the best-loved in the world - if you don't believe the sales figures, spend ten minutes with a True Believer. That causes real problems for anyone trying to adapt his books to the screen. For one thing, the fans' expectations of the movie format are as high as the book set them. For another, each reader already has a mental model of the beloved text's characters and settings, and woe to any movie-maker who transgresses against the conflicting imaginations of all the readers.

That said, I really liked the live-action versions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogfather/dp/B0010X741Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogfather</a>&nbsp;and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Color-of-Magic/dp/B002436WFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Color of Magic</a>. Unfortunately, they set the bar even higher for any video version of Pratchett's work. So, although ""Soul Music"" might otherwise have been a watchable enough low-budget animation, it just doesn't meet the standards already set by the book and by other movie adaptations. Even worse, it's broken up into half-hour segments that appear to represent the original made-for-telly format.

Recommended for the Pratchett completist or viewers with little or no Pratchett experience. Those of us in the middle ground of familiarity and fondness might not get the enjoyment from this that we had hoped for.

This is a reasonable adaptation.  The voice acting is decent, if occasionally jarring, simply because what I heard was not really what I imagined while reading the book.  The music is a sort of rockabilly, which I feel is quite appropriate.

After that, it's got... problems.

Adapting prose into film is always going to be a problem.  You can't show absolutely everything if you want to squeeze it into a reasonable time frame, so things have to be cut, and then the story's got to be changed so it makes sense with the cuts.

Then there's the stuff that can't be translated to film in the first place--at least, not easily--without having a narrator.  I've read complaints about the ""Soul Music"" and ""Wyrd Sisters"" cartoons that, while they may be very faithful to the source material, which they are, nearly all of the humor is lost, which it is.  I suspect that this is because most of the humor in Terry Pratchett comes from the prose, not the dialogue.  This makes me wonder how accessible they are to viewers who have not read Terry Pratchett; as much as I love ""Going Postal"" and ""Hogfather"", I can't help but feel that people who go in without already knowing the story will very quickly find themselves completely lost.  In either case, the lack of a narrator in ""Soul Music"" and ""Wyrd Sisters"" was a mistake.

Now let's talk about the animation.  From what I can tell, general consensus is that it's pretty bad, but I don't think it is.  It's not... I wouldn't call it bad.  I wouldn't call it ugly.  It's... off.  In fact, it's so off that I can't help but be reminded of the notorious cutscenes from the Zelda games on the Philips CD-i.

Let me explain.  First, it's standard practice in animation for the background to be a little darker than anything that's about to move.  In the case of ""Soul Music"", however, the contrast is so stark that the characters don't even seem to be in the scene; they sort of float there in the foreground.  Whoever worked on this also seems to belong to the school of thought that, in a cartoon, there must always be something moving.  The result is a lot of body language that really has nothing to do with what's being said, and a Death who... well, let's just say he's not as deadpan as he really should be.  It's hard to take an anthropomorphic personification seriously, even when he's voiced by Christopher Lee, when his skull moves as if it had eyebrows.  His skeleton is far more expressive than the dwarf Glod, who has a bizarre proto baseball cap and sneers at everything.

Overall, I can't really say I recommend this, unless you're already familiar with the story, and then I wouldn't buy the DVD.  Hop over to Amazon Instant and buy the first couple of episodes, then see what you think.",1357689600,,2902,4.543352601156069
7944470,5,B00005M0JJ,"My DVD arrived quickly and in good condition. It met my expectations and I would buy from this seller again. In terms of the DVD itself, I would have liked the character profiles to be more in depth but overall it's all still good.",1342915200,,231,4.2727272727272725
7944471,3,B00005M0JJ,"An animated serialization for Britain's Channel 4 of one of Terry Pratchett's numerous wonderfully witty ""Disc World"" novels. Those who've seen later telemovies with live actors and digital graphics might find this one hard to watch. It's animated, and it's broken into episodes, with titles and credits every time, unlike the later works which are not broken up.

Nonetheless it does the book justice. Everyone's favourite character, Death, is voiced by the legendary Christopher Lee. If anyone can talk in upper case, he can. But he's not happy, having just overseen the demise of his adopted family, and he takes time off to forget. Hard stuff for someone who even remembers things that are yet to happen, but while he's off, his grand-daughter is stuck with ""The Duty"".

Keep your wits about you or you'll miss a rock music allusion - for example, the band's troll roadie is named ""Asphalt"" - what else? It's a matter of playing spot the artist, from the fifties through the eras of the Beatles and psychedelia. And Death is just made for a Meat Loaf album cover...

If you came into Discworld via the later live movies, you might feel a little let down, but Pratchett lovers will possibly find it's worth bearing with the style of a short-episode serial to see if their picture of the novel matches what's on screen. You can decide how much you want to risk and get either a new edition or a used one. They're not that expensive, after all.",1289347200,,1445,4.703557312252965
