5053183,4,B0072YI2YI,I bought this to use in my church's children's area and it works very well.  The kids like the songs and so do the adults.,1421452800,,122,3.88
5053184,4,B0072YI2YI,"Overall, this is a great DVD. Our daughter started watching it around 18 months and still enjoys it now at 2 years old. It did have to grow on her (and my wife and I) a bit, but that's typical. Most of the music here is really great with many truly enjoyable songs for kids and adults alike.

Note that you get 11 songs but due to there being 3 special occasion songs as well and 1 remix, you essentially get only 7 distinct ""general"" songs (2 of these are apparently supposed to be special occasion songs as well but they work as general songs). As to the 3 special songs here: the Christmas one is very good, Happy Birthday is solid, and the Thanksgiving one is a major ear worm (you have been warned). I would have preferred 10 or 11 good general songs.",1421366400,,756,4.213793103448276

5053189,5,B0072YI2YI,"Yancy is an awesome artist.  As a children's pastor to young children, I love using this with our toddlers & preschoolers.  The music is SO easy to for the kids to learn and to sing. They LOVE the music.  Also, getting it on Amazon is much cheaper than on the artist website.  So if you need multiple copies, this is way to go!",1396569600,,327,4.142857142857143
5053190,5,B0072YI2YI,"We enjoyed Yancy for our VBS this year with Standard Publishing, so I looked into using her more at home and with our children's ministry at church.  My 3 year old really enjoys this DVD.  He picks up on songs quickly and enjoys watching them over and over.  Just a heads up though - this is the DVD for Home and Families NOT the DVD for church/Performance.  There is a different DVD that provides the performance tracks/mp4s to use in a presentation that is not sold on Amazon.",1379030400,2,478,4.3977272727272725

8509108,5,B0072YI2YI,"What a great DVD! I have a group of kids from 3-11. They ALL love this DVD. Older kids may grumble at the childlike graphics, but they quickly change their tune. The songs are catchy and the lyrics are on the screen but still very easy to pick up for my nonreaders. Highly recommend!",1514592000,,283,4.2592592592592595
