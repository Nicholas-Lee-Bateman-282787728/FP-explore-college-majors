8607402,5,B0020ZSYOM,"Perhaps the best psychological legal thrillers in the world. From the scripts, to the acting, to the direction, each episode is a thrilling masterpiece. Even though I see them with subtitles, I'm glued to the TV and delighted to be there!",1360540800,,238,4.829268292682927
8607403,1,B0020ZSYOM,"Swedish television and theaters utterly drown in this kind of junk. Endless cop shows and movies, based on endless series of cop novels, they were bad to begin with and they just get worse. The makers of these things look down on american movies but keep stealing from them in the most inept ways. They are bad in every single department.
