of his own.",1285200000,,175,3.72972972972973
8370503,5,B00005Y77U,"The Incredible Hulk aired on UPN Kids from September 1996 until September of 1999.  The show was well animated and humerous, another marvelous animated series from Marvel, no pun intended.  The only thing that confuses me is why Fox Kids video released it when it never aired on Fox Kids?  It aired on UPN Kids.",1010448000,,311,4.618181818181818
