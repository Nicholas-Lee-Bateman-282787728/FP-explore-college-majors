6261681,4,B00IEXX2MS,"I'm still thinking about this movie and how I feel about it.  I live in an area where hooping is very popular (on the east coast), so I have some personal experience with hooping.  The interaction between Christabel and Anah was of primary interest to me in this film.  The honesty and vulnerability from Anah was something that I really appreciated.  The differences in perspectives and goals from two equally talented individuals that came from such diverse backgrounds is something I am still thinking about.  Having parents with PhD's and being graduate educated vs. not finishing high school can change your perspective and goals so significantly.  Cristabel - your drive, charisma, followthrough, and ability to engage other people is inspiring. Anah - your creativity, talent, and honesty is also inspiring and I relate to what it is like to not have the same level of support as some others. Turning your vision into a financial success is not the most important thing, though I respect the skills and drive of people who can do so.  Anah, thank you for putting your vision out into the world - it was valuable and it touched me personally - even if it didn't play out exactly the way you would have hoped.  This story really resonated with me.  The film was worth it just for that.  So, thank you, again, for everyone who was willing to be so honest.

As much as I love hooping and enjoyed witnessing the different dance styles of everyone featured, in the end what I took away from this movie is not so much hooping information, but the diversity of how different people relate to the same object so differently.  It was an engaging experience to see the diversity of people engaging with the same hula hoops, in the same communities, but living it out so differently.  It was fun.  Now I just need to get some fuzzy leg warmers!  Fuzzy. Leg. Warmers.  That's all I'm saying!  The 'blooper reel' at the end during the credits was also very funny and made me smile.  Rubber spikes!  Yea!

I would have liked to understand the timeline of this film more clearly.  Time elapses, but I'm not sure how much.

If you have any interest in hooping at all, you should definitely watch this film.  It also highlights how life is NOT an equal opportunity employer, and difficult backgrounds can create very real obstacles even to really great people.  I hope the students in the after school program hung in there and finished high school!",1398384000,6,2438,4.682352941176471

8641701,5,B00IEXX2MS,"Loved ""The Hooping Life"" for not only a cool look into the fascinating subculture of hooping, but also for its satisfying emotional experience.
There is so much more here than a cute trend.  Tisha's after school and inner city work, Karis' gender and boundary defying performances, Baxter's honesty about depression, Sass' heartbreaking and redemptive story in dealing with rape, Christabel's ability to popularize this subculture, and Anah's raw, beautiful, painful and in-the-moment artistry, choreography and vision as the appropriately acknowledged mother of hooping culture.

Bravo, Amy Goldstein for a great film!

8641702,1,B00IEXX2MS,I expected more from this movie. Instead of learning in depth about the origin of modern hoopdance (It would of been faster and more insightful for me to google it) we are treated with 2 girls talking crap about each other like this was Unity of the Hoopers. The Shaquille O'Neal scene was oversold to try and attract non hoopers and really seems out of place. I doubt Shaq knows what hoopDANCE is. He's just telling you the same fitness information we've heard regurgitated a thousand times. Waste of time.,1422403200,,507,4.644444444444445
8641703,5,B00IEXX2MS,"As a hooping newcomer myself,  this film completely sucked me in. Its refreshing to see such a wide variety of people taking an interest in something as simple and unusual as spinning a plastic hoop. The Hooping Life was a real look at how a seemingly silly hobby can bring people from all over the world together. More importantly, I think the movie was a great look at how sometimes, no matter how hard we try things won't always go our way, but like the hoop, the world keeps spinning. I didn't expect to get emotional about a hula-hooping movie, but the honesty and vulnerability that everyone in The Hooping Life showed was extremely moving for me.
As another reviewer mentioned, I would have liked to better understand the timeline, as I was a little confused as to when a lot of the events were happening. Even with timeline confusion, though, I still highly recommend this movie for anyone even remotely interested in hooping or for anyone confused as to why in the world adults are still playing with a plastic toy.
This one will definitely get five stars from me if for no other reason than I felt the need to go outside and hoop the second I finished watching.",1410480000,,1171,4.549763033175355
8641704,5,B00IEXX2MS,"We are truly lucky that Amy Goldstein captured the origins of modern hoopdance in this spectacular film! As hooping continues to grow and rise in popularity all over the globe, I am grateful for this glowing record of its beginnings and the people who worked so hard to make it happen. A must-have for any hooper.",1409443200,,313,4.607142857142857
8641705,5,B00IEXX2MS,"For those of you (and I would include myself) not terribly interested in the hula hoops, you don't know what you're missing!!! The Hooping Life introduces us not just to a circle of plastic, but to a subculture, dance style(s), music, basically a whole movement that's going on all around us even if we don't know it's there. But I dare you not to notice hoops pretty much EVERYWHERE after you've seen this totally engaging film. Beautifully produced and edited, very much worth your time and money!",1409011200,,499,4.747126436781609
8641706,5,B00IEXX2MS,I keep watching it over and over.  I'm in love with hooping!,1406160000,,60,4.0
8641707,3,B00IEXX2MS,This movie only skims the surface of what I consider the hooping life. After all of the hype and the long wait I was a bit disappointed.,1402963200,,136,4.074074074074074
