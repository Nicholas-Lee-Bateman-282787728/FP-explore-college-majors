8675806,5,B00N2GP3JM,"The story is universal, the script fresh and intelligent, the direction brisk and fluent, and the acting first rate, starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart: friends off the stage and ideally matched in front of camera. She is at the height of her very considerable powers, and he is extraordinarily secure for so early in his movie career. This is less well known than ""Shop Around the Corner"", another of their films together, but a worthy partner. Ray Milland co-stars and gives a more understated performance than usual, which is all to the good. I should also add that the sound and picture quality are excellent. Highly recommended.",1525046400,,643,4.962962962962963

8675809,4,B00N2GP3JM,....but I'm not sure why anyone would purchase it at this price when you can get it plus 4 more wonderful James Stewart movies in the Screen Legend Collection for $2 less.,1385078400,10,171,4.375
