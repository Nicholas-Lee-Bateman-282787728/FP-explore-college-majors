I think she did a great job with the acting, the movie itself was alright, good amount of gore, lol!  Make sure theres no little ones around, with the good amount of cursing.  I'd recommend people to see it.",1199664000,3,303,4.016666666666667
3047243,4,B00105304M,"Though this flick is far from a masterpiece, and it has more nudity than most movies, it is fun, and somehow manages to make a girl running around mazes for an hour good. The first 85 minutes are whatever, fine, mediocre, you know. Then, the big twist comes and although *very minor spoilers* you kind of saw it, it still is shocking, and what happens in reaction is really ""WHOA""! My jaw had dropped to the floor. Be sure to get soem funny movie to watch afterwaqrds, because although it is a good FUN horror movie, it still is a little depressing and (although the two are COMPLETELY different, the enidng has a bit of a ""May"" feel)(2002, Angela Bettis & Anna Faris.) 3.5 stars.",1196899200,9,680,4.448
3047304,1,B00105304M,"I finally thought that the Amazon movie reviews had been truthful about a horror movie -- turns out so many of the 1-star reviews are because their movie playback didn't work, which has nothing to do with the movie and shouldn't be included in the reviews.

That being said -- this is just another painful, pathetic addition to a genre that is already overloaded with such things. The best thing about it is that it's NOT found footage.

Plot points below, so consider this something of a spoiler warning:

-Have the people who conceived this thing ever been to Paris? Or France at all? Or outside of LA? Have they ever actually BEEN in the catacombs, or any catacombs? I imagine not.
-The main character is a sniveling little victim who is thoroughly unlikeable and spends most of the movie screaming ""please"" and ""f***""
-The main character's sister and 'french' friends are so stereotyped and badly written, they don't even resemble actual human people in any way""
-oh no, goat mask, forbidden french naughty bits, and devil worship! What a creative premise!
-The twist -- the only twist here is me trying to wring my own neck so that this painful viewing experience can finally be over.",1495238400,2,1189,4.734299516908212

3047307,2,B00105304M,"I did not like this movie for reasons many other reviewers have noted: poor acting, simplistic plot, too much of the victim running through dark tunnels screaming her head off.

The ending was satisfying in a way though.",1493856000,,367,4.575757575757576
3047308,1,B00105304M,"Wow, what a terrible movie. extremely boring with a plot that pretty much went nowhere. The acting is way below par, especially from Alecia Moore, AKA Pink, who I am hoping just sticks to singing. I wasn't too sure if the plot was supposed to be a horror flick or if the Director just wanted to see how often throughout the movie he could get the lead actress to scream and say the words, ""leave me alone!"" I am sorry but if it was at all possible, I would rate this movie a negative 3 stars. Having said that, there is a ray of light to be had here.

3047366,4,B00105304M,"The maze-like city beneath the city of Paris is, of course, the perfect setting for a horror movie.  Populated by the corpses of six or seven million skeletal remains of Parisians past, the hundreds of miles of winding passages cast in perpetual preternatural darkness have claimed the lives of many who never found their way back to the light.  The mystery of the place, reinforced by the authorities attempts to keep people out, makes it an irresistible attraction to rebellious young people and others with a penchant for the darker side.  This film never manages to capture the truly claustrophobic and disorienting nature of the catacombs or to inspire any real sense of fright in the viewer, but it is still well worth watching if you're a horror fan  thanks in large part to a very effective ending.

We don't know a lot about Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon) when she arrives in Paris.  Shes there because her sister Carolyn (played by Pink aka Alecia Moore) invited her, she takes pills to help her deal with anxiety, and thats about it.  Carolyn is her complete opposite, a total extrovert who lives a rather bohemian lifestyle apparently centered around having fun.  The historic attractions of Paris apparently have little meaning for her, as she almost immediately drags her weary sister to a secret underground party located in  well, Im sure you can figure that one out on your own.  Naturally, Victoria eventually ends up lost and alone, desperately searching for a way out while being pursued by someone or something with bad intentions.

These catacombs never really come to life.  The passages seem too wide, there is an almost complete lack of crawlspaces requiring one to skitter along atop or through piles of human remains, and there is never a sense of the walls and ceilings closing in.  Im highly claustrophobic, and this film never made me the least bit uncomfortable.  Without the buildup of any sense of dread, the scenes that are supposed to be frightening don't really deliver, either.  So why am I giving it four stars?  The ending really saves this film from being average and somewhat forgettable.  I would argue that it is not predictable (I did guess right about one thing, but the ending as a whole was not something I saw coming), and that it is quite effective  and, at least for me, quite satisfying.  If you only watch one movie set in the catacombs beneath Paris, watch As Above, So Below  but give Catacombs a chance, as well.",1473984000,,2464,4.793838862559242

Oops, I spoiled it, but hey I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR SO YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS RUBBISH. It was completely predictable, the filming sucked, and the acting sucked even more.

Do. Not. Watch. This. Even the plot is ridiculous.

I just don't understand the sisters' relationship, there was no connection at all. which just made it unbelievable that if your relationship is that bad why would you go to a country just to visit? Plus obviously you see your sister is popping pills for apparently some issues (which was never even mentioned in the movie) why would you think it be a great idea to prank her in miles and miles of catacombs thinking she is being followed by a killer, i mean how demented, selfish, crude, and a s***ty family member are you?!?! It makes no sense in thinking if she has those pills why would you think it be good for her to go through that and honestly you and your stupid friends deserve getting killed...just saying..
I so wished the killer was real that story of a child being grown up as the antichrist and pretty much an animal is such a good idea and it just got wasted away in my opinion. All the movie was about running around screaming in the dark like a fool. I would have been happy with the killer and bloody gore instead of running around with her wondering whats going on and where the exit is to only come out you just got played....i snapped too and thought it was a waste...",1423526400,,1411,4.30827067669173

3047447,5,B00105304M,"Catacombs is about an American woman who visits her sister in Paris France where apparently several buried bodies are hidden underground in the city of romance.  Now whether this is true or not I haven't a single clue.  I've never heard such a thing until tonight but it *does* say in the beginning that the story's based on actual events.  I don't know- I might have to question that one.  If anyone knows whether there really are thousands of dead buried bodies underground in Paris feel free to drop me a comment below.

Anyway it turns out when the American woman meets up with her sister, the sister is a really sleazy party girl.  The complete opposite of her shy anti-social American sister.  The American sister doesn't exactly follow in her sisters footsteps and wants nothing to do with the party life whatsoever even though she's dragged into it against her wishes, so on one occasion when both sisters are in the catacombs partying with friends, the American sister insists on leaving and being the party pooper.  However... the supposed catacombs under Paris is basically a gigantic confusing maze (which actually looks relatively straightforward in the movie, perhaps due to the movie being somewhat short so they didn't have time to reveal all the secret areas).

The Paris party girl knows the catacombs very well and understands her sister won't be able to find her way through the maze on her own, so she follows... only for the Paris chick to suddenly get attacked by a masked man and a sharp weapon and die on the floor in bloody fashion, leaving the American girl frightened and concerned for her own safety.  She only has a flashlight but also possesses a VERY desperate desire to escape so she runs, runs and runs some more.  A good chunk of the movie is her running down dark hallways whenever the chase is on (luckily the hallways aren't dark enough to not be able to see anything, which is a surprising benefit).

Now there's an incredibly big twist here that would be unfair for me to spoil since it would totally ruin the movie for all my loyal faithful readers out there!  Some things are better left unsaid.  Let's just say, something's not quite right with this whole scenario.

Anyway while the girl is running down the dark confusing hallways alone, she soon meets up with a French guy.  Unintentional humor ensues as the English speaking girl and the French language-speaking only guy try to communicate with each other but fail to do so.  Basically from this point forward -without spoiling what exactly is happening- the masked killer is suspiciously absent for a while.  Longer than he should be *wink wink*.  Anyway after a while the girl resumes to running for her life looking for ANY way out of here with her trusty flashlight.

The actual suspense is surprisingly abundant once you get through the first 25 minutes of useless party segments.  These party segments were so generic I never would have guessed the quality of the storytelling much less the horror would actually improve drastically but it does.  Run for your life!",1401408000,,3069,4.761814744801512

The acting was abysmal, the plot & story-line Non-existent, and the scares missing.  To sit and watch this for 2 hours was like wasting a part of my life; I felt I was the idiot for sitting through this crap.
Another brain-deficient reviewer stated this would be a ""cult classic"" in 10 years, NOT in 1000 years would this be considered anything but a waste of film (or digital media). The only thing one can say for certain is that in 10 years viewers will look back and say what trash was produced in that era and what stupid people must have been around to watch this.
This movie had absolutely NOTHING going for it, it was another flick typically made for sucker bait and churned out to fill a contract.
I would be ashamed to have my name anywhere on the credits associated with this....imagine putting this on your resume as being a director or producer or actor in this garbage and submitting it for serious consideration - the only interesting aspect would be that one was actually able to market this to viewers.

Started watching 'Catacombs' on amazon prime yesterday afternoon. The story deals with a group that holds wild parties in the catacombs below Paris. They have loud music set up, bars, a stage, all sorts of things that would seem to be impossible given the location.  Since it's illegal to do this they constantly change the location of the parties so that the police can not find them. They say in the film that there are many hundreds of miles of catacombs below the city. This is probably an extreme exaggeration for the sake of the story.  The description of the plot at the IMDB intrigued me ""On her first trip to Paris, a young woman hits a party in the Catacombs, the 200-mile labyrinth of limestone tunnels under the city that's lined with the remains of 7 million people. Separated from her friends, she becomes convinced that someone or something is chasing her.""  Sounds interesting right? So I put on the film.  Right off viewing it was hard, it's one of those movies that seems to think people have such a short attention span they have to flash from one scene quickly to another or we will lose interest.  It wasn't done constantly; there were periods of normal scenes where we have time to adjust to what we are looking at. I held out for about a half hour or so to see what was ahead, hoping they might stop the irritating quick changes.  The final straw for me was when one character started telling some back story about a satanic like group.  They showed images of important Christian religious figures being defiled. Like the the head on a statue of the Virgin Mary being smashed up and more.  This to me was upsetting so I simply turned off the movie.  I've noticed that Christianity has become an easy target in many films and other media now a days. It's become a target while other religion's symbols have not, perhaps for fear of retribution by them. Can you imagine a movie showing the destruction of the Koran for instance and the up roar that would create ?  Too bad these sort of scenes seem to be used for shock value.

3047520,3,B00105304M,"A chilling, and at times claustrophobic adventure, the subterranean horror thriller Catacombs (2007) is set in Paris, where far below the surface, an extensive system of underground tunnels and chambers is supposedly home to a crazed cannibalistic killer.  While the film is generally well shot and effectively creepy at times, much of film's effectiveness is lost due to the poorly written characters who behave illogically, in an attempt to heighten the drama.  While Catacombs does deliver some solid thrills, the annoying characters, and suspect story, contributes to a film that leaves you with a bad aftertaste.  Spoilers follow.

Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon) comes to Paris at the invitation of her sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore, aka Pink), and is introduced to her friends, who take great delight in scaring her for fun.  The sisters and the rest of the group attend a secret rave party, being held illegally in the underground tunnel system.  The group slips away to take a dip in a subterranean pool, but Victoria decides to head back to the party.  Wandering through the tunnels, Victoria has just been joined by Carolyn, when they are attacked.  Carolyn is apparently killed, and Victoria is being chased through a maze of tunnels, by someone wearing a goat's head mask.

Victoria manages to escape, and rejoins the rave party, when the sudden appearance of the police, causes a mass exit, during which Victoria is knocked out.  She wakes up alone, and attempts to find a way out, but discovers that she is trapped behind locked gates.  She encounters Henri (Emil Hostina), who is also trapped inside, and using his map, they attempt to make their way to the surface, but later come to a parting of the ways.

Amazingly, Victoria's skimpy party dress doesn't get torn to shreds during her ordeal.  The situation is extremely farfetched, but given it's a horror film, it's not that difficult to go along for the ride, and ignore things like the practical considerations of setting up a bar, and lighting and sound system in a cave, which then magically disappears.  Once Victoria is alone, things do settle down and become more tense, although she proves to be very loud and annoying, and when in danger, always seems to do things that draws attention to herself.

Shannyn Sossamon carries the film well enough, and appears to be taking the term ""scream queen"" to heart.  Although noisy, Victoria actually does some intelligent things, and several times is on the verge of getting to safety.  Along the way she acquires an axe, and they become inseparable.  When Victoria falls into a pool of water, she somehow manages to swim to safety, while still clutching the heavy tool.  And she can also run like a jackrabbit, not injure herself, and maintain her balance, while still carrying the pickaxe.  This is no easy task, but for Victoria, the pickaxe seems light as a feather.

The twisty ending provides a definitive finish, to a story filled with mostly unlikeable characters.  Put through hell, you can certainly empathize with Victoria, but only so far, which makes the film something of a disappointment.  The conclusion leads you to believe that there is no masked killer in the tunnels, but had writers and co-directors David Elliot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G-I-Joe-The-Rise-of-Cobra/dp/B002NXSRVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G.I.

3047543,4,B00105304M,"This is an atmospheric movie, with a credible, followable story and lots of exciting moments!  A girl gets a letter from her sister, saying simply: ""You need to come to Paris.""  When she gets there, the sisters do NOT visit the Louvre, or fancy Parisian restaurants, or even window-shop at the more fasionable and expensive dress shops.  For some reason, (explained at the very end of the movie), the sister in Paris wants her American-living sister to visit the underground catacombs of Paris -- where a ""party"" of sorts is being held.  The sisters DO go shopping -- but not for high-fashion clothes!  (No matter how poor a person is, WHY anyone wants to go to the ""lower depths"" of society -- the ""grunge"", ""punk"" or just totally-rebellious scene, is something I'll never figure out.  But, as the French say, ""chacun a son gout"", (Everyone to their own taste.)

Well, our heroine has quite an adventure.  Events transpire that she gets LOST in the underground catacombs of Paris -- where a few million people are, (in reality, actually) buried, row upon row, upon row, upon row!  She meets up with a 'phantom beast', and a guy who MAY, (or may not), want to help her.  The passages where she runs THROUGH the maze-passages of the catacombs get to be a bit longish and wearying -- but that makes the movie all the more scary and real.  The viewer, too, eventually just wants to get OUT of those passages, and back to the safety of the above-ground party, and then go HOME.  Will our heroine finally get out of the catacombs?  Or will she remain, wandering there forever, (and eventually in the darkness, as flashlight batteries eventually do die....)?

W A R N I N G...S P O I L E R....A L E R T.............The ending of the film is a realistic shocker....and is one of the best lessons in anger-management I have ever seen portrayed on the screen. To say more would TOTALLY give away the ending...perhaps I have said too much already.  However, it reveals nothing of the plot to say this is an intense, engrossing little thriller, that will keep any horror-affictionado on the edge of her or his seat!  There is a laudable very small amount of bloodshed, and a laudable small amount of 4-letter words. (But there is some of each, so if you don't like these things AT ALL, stay away.)  The emphasis here is on plot, storyline, and characters.  The way all good horror-stories used to be.  The viewer's imagination is also put to some use...and this makes things even more delightfully(?) scary. Personally, I have divided scary movies into two types: ""horror"" movies, (of which CATACOMBS is a fine example), which rely on plot, dialogue and character for suspense, and ""horriBLE"" movies, which rely on gore, shock-type 4-letter words and special effects, often with a story and dialogue that are totally simplistic.  CATACOMBS at least has little gore and very few 4-letter words.  It has a plot and a moral.  It has good dialogue and credible acting.  It is the classic horror movie genre, updated a bit for today's audience.  Good show!",1256515200,,3040,4.692452830188679

As they, along with some friends, descend into the French catacombs, bad things end up happening, culminating with Victoria seeking a way to escape the maze-like underground catacombs.  While it does have a good dose of atmosphere and makes good on some historical facts, Catacombs as a whole just ends up being too boring for its own good.  By the time we get passed the halfway point of the film, we don't care if Victoria or anyone else escapes or not.  What does save the film from the scrap heap however is a dynamite twist ending, which may leave you feeling a little cheated, but in actuality helps make Catacombs better than it should be.

3047546,1,B00105304M,"Catacombs (Tomm Coker and David Elliott, 2007)

Catacombs, as far as I could ever tell, was made expressly to give mediocre pop singer Pink some sort of entree into the film world. And if you look at it as nothing more than this, it succeeds, on the level that, well, Pink is on film, though she's an even worse actress than she is a singer. In every other way, however, the film is as absolute a failure as is possible, and its only real saving grace is that it's not the worst movie I've seen today (that honor would go to Dark Fields, which, despite us only being four days into the year, I am 90% certain will be one of the five worst movies I see in 2009).

The pop tart and Shannyn Sossamon (Wristcutters: A Love Story) star as sisters. Pink is Carolyn, the wild one, currently enrolled in graduate school at the Sorbonne. Sossamon is Victoria, the staid undergraduate student with mental problems. Carolyn invites Victoria to France for a vacation, and as the movie opens, Victoria is arriving in Paris. Carolyn has plans to take Victoria to a rave in the catacombs; things get weird when Victoria, already away from her usual meds and having taken a dose of absinthe (and really, why is it that absinthe supposedly has these incredible qualities?), gets separated from Carolyn and her friends, and becomes convinced that a serial killer who lives in the catacombs, whom the group had been telling her about, is chasing her.

The main problem with the movie is its pace; one wonders (or should) how the movie is going to continue on when everything you read about on the back of the box has already happened within the first twenty minutes, and you've still got seventy to go. Excellent question, and the answer is, ""the movie will bore you to tears as, essentially, nothing happens for sixty of those seventy minutes."" Then come the final ten, and while I admit to cheering a bit when Victoria reaches the obvious conclusion during the climactic scene, but honestly, did no one see that coming?

As well, Coker and Elliott are another directorial team who have mistaken the idea that ""overly dark"" and ""atmospheric"" are identical, and thus about half the movie is very difficult to see. Brilliant. The acting is, at its best, competent (Sossamon is normally half-decent, but her role here mostly involves standing and screaming, running and screaming, and falling down and screaming). The big plot twist is painfully obvious from, oh, a minute and a half into the movie (or, if you're really not paying attention, you may not figure it out till half an hour or so), and while I admit that it's a good plot twist (in the sense that I was mutely cheering for Sossamon's character for actually making a halfway intelligent choice during the climax), the predictability of it did rather dull the fun. And, of course, as to be expected from any movie containing a mediocre pop singer, the soundtrack is horrific.

Put me in mind of Sheitan, for some reason, except that Sheitan was good, and did eventually come up with a plot. (half)",1233964800,3,3037,4.6585820895522385

In some senses, the movie has an entertaining quality to it.  But the typical mistakes of B-horror will drive you crazy if you can't help but pick your horror movies apart.  We all want to be frightened by horror, but we need that scare to be believable in order to buy into it.  This movie is only believable in the sense that the characters, like people we all know, are very, very dumb.

This movie is very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>.  There are no special effects to speak of.  There's a lot of screaming, running, darkness and flashing lights to distract you.  Yet not a lot happens.  It's not really scary per se.  The film does build up some angst with those techniques, but only if you are easily startled or have weak nerves.  If you liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, you may really enjoy this.  If you thought that was silly, just move on.

If you've read the synopsis you know that the film takes place in the underground catacombs of Paris.  They really do exist, although not in the way they are depicted in the movie.  The set is well put together considering the budget.  And they are in Paris after all!  Yet despite the beautiful location, the film is visually mediocre with no special cinematography to speak of.  A shot of the Eiffel Tower fully lit is the best you'll get.

The script makes a little bit of sense when you get to the end.  Yet the way the plot is resolved leaves the character's actions making no sense. Still, I would say most people will find the *twist* at the end to be predictable, though there are many possible endings based upon the way the first half is set up.

The consistency of the locale is never really maintained.  Even though they are in Paris, we see writing on the wall in English.  Not to mention people give speeches in English, the French talk to each other in English, and then the main character ... meets a guy who speaks only French.  What?  If they were going to translate everything into English, that would have been one thing.  But the inconsistency, while not a deal breaker, is a sign of a mediocre script.

I like Shannyn Sossamon as Victoria.  I think she has some talent, though I don't think she is at her best here.  It's hard to think of that as a positive but it might be all things considered.

Plenty of the acting is mediocre to bad, but most of the movie is so focused on the Victoria character that it isn't as big of a liability.  Even at 50%, she carries this movie.  When you have terrible lines to deliver, it doesn't make acting any easier.  The supporting cast is generally just OK.  I don't think that Pink is as bad as people say, but she's not exactly great either. The lines are especially weak in the final sequence where everything gets explained.

When you do reach the conclusion, there are many questions left unanswered.  Granted the cast is disposed of quite easily.  But it's never clear how our heroine, who is lost for most of the movie, finally gets out of the catacombs.

Conclusion

If you are looking for mindless horror for a Friday night, this might do the trick. This is no masterpiece, but it's better than many B-horror movies.  However, it's still a B-horror movie.  There is very little in terms of unintended humor.  The saving grace is that is over quick.

If you are picky about the details in your horror movies, don't expect too much from this one.  This is more of a thriller than a pure horror movie, but at times it tries to be both. Rent this before buying the DVD.

This might be a three star movie for those who seek mindless diversion.  For me it just misses the cut.  And while it wasn't the worst I've seen, I would not seek it out for another viewing.

3047550,4,B00105304M,"Being that it's Friday the 13th I figure I have to watch a scary movie before the nights up. I decided to go with Catacombs and was quite happy with the outcome. I wouldn't say this film was too scary but the atmosphere was excellent. It was probably the best use of atmosphere I've seen since The Decsent, leaving you feeling very chilled and claustrophobic at times.

The story starts with Victoria (played by the stunningly cute Shannyn Sossamon) as she arrives in Paris after being invited by her troublesome sister Carolyn (played by singer Pink). Carolyn is on a mission to break Victoria out of her shell and starts by dragging her to a party. However this party is a bit different from the norm being that it takes place in the catacombs under the bright lights of the Paris streets where 7 million bodies lie. As the rave starts going Carolyn and company choose to take a dip in some dingy body of water in the catacombs. As they press for Victoria to come in she gets pissed and decides to walk back to the rave on her own. This really isn't the best idea. It's pretty much like walking through a maze with little hope of finding an exit. The story begins to heat up here and has you leaning on the edge of your seat for the rest of the way.

This one is well worth checking out. It's certainly not the scariest film out there but does have a few tense moments. What's nice about it is it's creative and a little different from the run of the mill horror of today. Atmosphere is really what earned this one an extra star or two since it gives you a very uneasy feeling at time.",1213315200,,1587,4.304347826086956
3047551,3,B00105304M,"Catacombs begins with a drug and alcohol filled blur of a hedonistic rave.  Below and amongst the ravers is a dark, dingy set of tunnels and dirt-covered floors, the source of the movie's title: the Catacombs.  It turns out that the Catacombs are a series of tunnels below Paris in which the remains of millions have been turned into abstract art and stacked to the ceilings.  It appears that some are not content with current body count.

Victoria (Sossamon) receives a post card from her sister Caroline (Pink) one day, inviting her to France.  Days later she boards a plane to Paris, and her life will never be the same.  I can't go further without mentioning the fact that Sossamon is gorgeous as always and truly shows her range in this emotion-filled thriller.

Upon arrival, there is almost immediately an awkward scene in which the sisters go shopping in Paris.  It had the feel of a bad 70s movie for a while - something the director surely chose - and it just didn't work.  I immediately wanted Pink to be the first person murdered.

Anyway, the sisters make their way to a party hosted by Huge, a hulking black guy, and Jean Michele, a suave party leader obsessed with death.  Searching for a little cool down from the rave, the group and a few others make their way to an underground sitting room of sorts.  It is here that Victoria, who doesn't drink, gets her first taste of absinthe.  She seems to enjoy it quite a bit because she has at least two huge mugs.  During this scene is when Jean Michele tells the story of a goat-head-wearing killer who has been roaming the catacombs for years.  Moments later, cops raid the rave in a spastic, epilepsy-inducing sequence that triggers Vicki's agoraphobia, and causes her to hit her head, knocking herself unconcious.

She awakes to a pitch-black, abandoned, post-rave catacomb, and to make matters worse, the police have barricaded the way out.

The rest of the movie plays upon the basic fears of most people.  To some extent, claustrophobia and nyctophobia (fear of the dark) get us all.  Full of contrast scares (i.e. dark to light, quiet to loud), and the scary possibility of the legend being true, Vicki must struggle with her fears, the dangers lurking in the dark, and discovery of who she should really fear.",1211155200,2,2278,4.678391959798995

3047583,3,B00105304M,"Since I am flying off to the City of Lights a week from today I thought watching a horror movie set beneath the streets of Paris in the city's famous catacombs seemed like an appropriate choice for last night's late night fare.  However, this 2007 films from the writer-director tag team of Tomm Coker and David Elliot is not actually filmed in the catacombs of Paris, it is merely set there.  Too bad, because I figure that there is no way on earth (or beneath it) that my wife is going to want to spend any of her first trip to Paris looking at thousands and thousands of skulls and bones.

""Catacombs"" begins with an ominous voice over from Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon), who explains: ""My sister sent me a postcard.  All it said was, 'Come to Paris.  It will be good for you.'  Forty-eight hours after I arrived, she and everyone I'd met were dead.""  Such foreshadowing hardly constitutes spoilers in this genre, so Victoria meets up with her sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore, a.k.a. Pink) and her group of wacky bohemian friends.  After a day of shopping Carolyn and her friends drag Victoria to a secret rave that takes place in the catacombs that night.  There they meet up with Jean-Michel (Mihai Stanescu), who tells Victoria the story of a deranged killer raised by a satanic cult who feeds on those poor souls who get lost in the catacombs.  This, as all devotees of the horror genre know, is the sort of convenient exposition that are a staple of such films, taken as a joke or urban legend, but, of course, necessary background information for what is about to take place.  It does not take long for Victoria to become separated from her sister and lost in the catacombs, so the merriment can begin.

The problem is that things slow down after the initial attack.  There is, I suppose, some effort to take advantage of the setting as a labyrinth in which our heroine is lost, but nothing that follows is particularly interesting.  At least if this were happening in the real catacombs of Paris that would be interesting, but the sets are just sets (in Romania no less).  Since Victoria is separate from everybody she met and we are focusing on what is happening to her, which sort of limits the opportunities for blood and gore, which helps contribute to the lethargy of the middle part of the film (during which time you keep trying to wrap your mind around the idea that Sossamon and Pink are sisters).  But you should keep watching because the best part of this film is the ending, which may be entirely relatively.  After watching hundreds of horror films that have laughable or less than laudable endings, I liked the way this one comes round full-circle to Victoria's ominous words at the start.

Later Victoria gets seperated from everyone as she gets lost in the 200-mile maze of tunnels and must find a way out before a homicidal maniac who lives in the maze comes and gets her.

An enjoyable little slasher thriller from the producers of ""Saw"" known as Twisted Pictures definitely relies on psychological chills and clausophobia. There is some gore shown but not too much even there's a grisly flashback on the killer's history, the acting is ok and so is the twists but this is an enjoyable and sometimes suprising psychological thriller with some decent scares and fun.

3047590,5,B00105304M,"One Missed Call's release has inspired my interest in the Shannyn Post ""Rules of Attraction"" Renaissance. What I see as a phenomenon where indie directors with a decent amount of money can pay Shannyn's agent to appear in a low budget movie. Suddenly it becomes ""if you could have Shannyn star in your movie, what would you have her do?""

Catacombs is a french horror/suspense movie starring Shannyn Sossamon and Pink. Pink's character Carolyn invites Shannyn Sossamon's character Victoria, her sister, to come to Paris. Apparently Victoria has been having some issues, though they're not fully explained, one of them appears to be with drugs, and the trip is to sort of ""get away from everything"". They spend the day shopping and site seeing when finally Carolyn takes Victoria to a party/rave. The party is held underground in Paris' catacombs, one of the largest mass graves in the world. You meet the guy who hosts the party, and during one scene you hear of the legend of this child born of incest that was raised on nothing but raw meat, and made to wear a goat skin mask (aka the Antichrist) that supposedly lives down in the catacombs. When the police raid the catacombs, Shannyn's character hits her head while fleeing only to wake up alone in the maze of skulls and bones.

Why I like this movie:

Shannyn's character in the movie is very similar to that of Lauren from Rules of Attraction, so people who became fans of her from ROA will be sure to appreciate this movie. Actually, she's so similar that I've been coming to think of this movie as ROA2: Catacombs.

The movie, although seemingly a straight to video horror/suspense flick, is actually very stylized and ""vibey"", especially with the music. Everything from the shopping scene that is like an overwhelming ecstatic blur in Victoria's mind (also reminds me heavily of Victor's Trip to Europe scene from ROA), to the scene where they're driving to the party and the chill french hip hop is playing, to all the music that is played at the party that is heavily reverbed through the catacomb walls.

This movie does a good job of portraying what it's like to have a bad trip at a party. The flashing lights and the faces that echo in your mind as you try to make your way to the bar where all you need is a cup of water. Maybe I found these scenes so intense because I was high while watching the movie both times, dunno.

I would like to be more sensical in describing how great this movie is, but it comes out in bits and pieces. I will just say that of all Shannyn's new movies that I've watched since ROA, this is the best one. It's her second best movie. It really surprised me. I would have never watched something like this but my interest in her made me download and watch it only to see her and I was surprised at what a great flick it was. I even went ahead and preordered the US DVD which comes out February 19th. For anyone who liked Shan in ROA or who likes suspense, I recommend downloading this (I got it off mininova). I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS MOVIE!",1202515200,7,3036,4.510909090909091
3047591,3,B00105304M,"""Catacombs"" (produced by Lions Gate Films / Twisted Pictures) stars Shannyn Sossamon as Victoria, slightly nervous American girl who has just arrived in Paris. Victoria visits her fun-loving sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore aka Pink) who with her friends in Paris drags timid Victoria down to the illegal party (like a rock concert) secretly thrown in Paris catacombs.

This is where the remains of seven-million people sleep in the maze of tunnels and graves, a creepy subterranean network that spans nearly 200 miles in length. For Victoria, however, things get serious when she gets lost there and runs into something very strange. Victoria must find out a way to get out of this place, but what can she do alone in the dark?

The story of ""Catacombs"" fairly looks like the 2004 horror film ""Creep"" (starring Franka Potente) or the 2005 thriller ""The Descent"" (far scarier than the other two). The difference is the nice choice of the location. The realistic production designs (the ""Paris catacombs"" were actually constructed in the soundstage in Romania) are fantastic, but sadly director Tomm Coker and David Elliot fail to use the claustrophobic atmosphere to the full.

For Victoria screams a lot and runs around in the maze, but the film itself is hardly scary. The pretty simple story, which has a potential of becoming a more gripping thriller, suddenly stops going further until the very ending which you will either love or hate.

I don't know why, but Shannyn Sossamon keeps appearing in horror films - ""The Order"" ""Devour"" and ... ""One Missed Call."" I don't think her acting here is bad though it is not great either. My impression may have something to do with the character she plays because you may (and I did) find the character of Victoria a bit annoying. Yes, fear brings out the worst in people, but does that have to be shown in this way? Alecia Moore fares better as her sister, who plays a key role in the film, but the time allotted to her character is not very long.

Frankly I was disappointed with ""Catacombs"" because I expected more from the film; something original and new. In fact the film has one, but you have to wait for that very long. The film, which as far as I know was not shown in theaters in USA, is not a terrible disaster, but could be much better if shorter and tighter.",1200614400,22,2312,4.6987654320987655

-Have the people who conceived this thing ever been to Paris? Or France at all? Or outside of LA? Have they ever actually BEEN in the catacombs, or any catacombs? I imagine not.
-The main character is a sniveling little victim who is thoroughly unlikeable and spends most of the movie screaming ""please"" and ""f***""
-The main character's sister and 'french' friends are so stereotyped and badly written, they don't even resemble actual human people in any way""

3281863,4,B00105304M,"The maze-like city beneath the city of Paris is, of course, the perfect setting for a horror movie.  Populated by the corpses of six or seven million skeletal remains of Parisians past, the hundreds of miles of winding passages cast in perpetual preternatural darkness have claimed the lives of many who never found their way back to the light.  The mystery of the place, reinforced by the authorities attempts to keep people out, makes it an irresistible attraction to rebellious young people and others with a penchant for the darker side.  This film never manages to capture the truly claustrophobic and disorienting nature of the catacombs or to inspire any real sense of fright in the viewer, but it is still well worth watching if you're a horror fan  thanks in large part to a very effective ending.

We don't know a lot about Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon) when she arrives in Paris.  Shes there because her sister Carolyn (played by Pink aka Alecia Moore) invited her, she takes pills to help her deal with anxiety, and thats about it.  Carolyn is her complete opposite, a total extrovert who lives a rather bohemian lifestyle apparently centered around having fun.  The historic attractions of Paris apparently have little meaning for her, as she almost immediately drags her weary sister to a secret underground party located in  well, Im sure you can figure that one out on your own.  Naturally, Victoria eventually ends up lost and alone, desperately searching for a way out while being pursued by someone or something with bad intentions.

These catacombs never really come to life.  The passages seem too wide, there is an almost complete lack of crawlspaces requiring one to skitter along atop or through piles of human remains, and there is never a sense of the walls and ceilings closing in.  Im highly claustrophobic, and this film never made me the least bit uncomfortable.  Without the buildup of any sense of dread, the scenes that are supposed to be frightening don't really deliver, either.  So why am I giving it four stars?  The ending really saves this film from being average and somewhat forgettable.  I would argue that it is not predictable (I did guess right about one thing, but the ending as a whole was not something I saw coming), and that it is quite effective  and, at least for me, quite satisfying.  If you only watch one movie set in the catacombs beneath Paris, watch As Above, So Below  but give Catacombs a chance, as well.",1473984000,,2464,4.793838862559242

3281944,5,B00105304M,"Catacombs is about an American woman who visits her sister in Paris France where apparently several buried bodies are hidden underground in the city of romance.  Now whether this is true or not I haven't a single clue.  I've never heard such a thing until tonight but it *does* say in the beginning that the story's based on actual events.  I don't know- I might have to question that one.  If anyone knows whether there really are thousands of dead buried bodies underground in Paris feel free to drop me a comment below.

Anyway it turns out when the American woman meets up with her sister, the sister is a really sleazy party girl.  The complete opposite of her shy anti-social American sister.  The American sister doesn't exactly follow in her sisters footsteps and wants nothing to do with the party life whatsoever even though she's dragged into it against her wishes, so on one occasion when both sisters are in the catacombs partying with friends, the American sister insists on leaving and being the party pooper.  However... the supposed catacombs under Paris is basically a gigantic confusing maze (which actually looks relatively straightforward in the movie, perhaps due to the movie being somewhat short so they didn't have time to reveal all the secret areas).

The Paris party girl knows the catacombs very well and understands her sister won't be able to find her way through the maze on her own, so she follows... only for the Paris chick to suddenly get attacked by a masked man and a sharp weapon and die on the floor in bloody fashion, leaving the American girl frightened and concerned for her own safety.  She only has a flashlight but also possesses a VERY desperate desire to escape so she runs, runs and runs some more.  A good chunk of the movie is her running down dark hallways whenever the chase is on (luckily the hallways aren't dark enough to not be able to see anything, which is a surprising benefit).

Now there's an incredibly big twist here that would be unfair for me to spoil since it would totally ruin the movie for all my loyal faithful readers out there!  Some things are better left unsaid.  Let's just say, something's not quite right with this whole scenario.

Anyway while the girl is running down the dark confusing hallways alone, she soon meets up with a French guy.  Unintentional humor ensues as the English speaking girl and the French language-speaking only guy try to communicate with each other but fail to do so.  Basically from this point forward -without spoiling what exactly is happening- the masked killer is suspiciously absent for a while.  Longer than he should be *wink wink*.  Anyway after a while the girl resumes to running for her life looking for ANY way out of here with her trusty flashlight.

The actual suspense is surprisingly abundant once you get through the first 25 minutes of useless party segments.  These party segments were so generic I never would have guessed the quality of the storytelling much less the horror would actually improve drastically but it does.

Started watching 'Catacombs' on amazon prime yesterday afternoon. The story deals with a group that holds wild parties in the catacombs below Paris. They have loud music set up, bars, a stage, all sorts of things that would seem to be impossible given the location.  Since it's illegal to do this they constantly change the location of the parties so that the police can not find them. They say in the film that there are many hundreds of miles of catacombs below the city. This is probably an extreme exaggeration for the sake of the story.  The description of the plot at the IMDB intrigued me ""On her first trip to Paris, a young woman hits a party in the Catacombs, the 200-mile labyrinth of limestone tunnels under the city that's lined with the remains of 7 million people. Separated from her friends, she becomes convinced that someone or something is chasing her.""  Sounds interesting right? So I put on the film.  Right off viewing it was hard, it's one of those movies that seems to think people have such a short attention span they have to flash from one scene quickly to another or we will lose interest.  It wasn't done constantly; there were periods of normal scenes where we have time to adjust to what we are looking at. I held out for about a half hour or so to see what was ahead, hoping they might stop the irritating quick changes.  The final straw for me was when one character started telling some back story about a satanic like group.  They showed images of important Christian religious figures being defiled. Like the the head on a statue of the Virgin Mary being smashed up and more.  This to me was upsetting so I simply turned off the movie.  I've noticed that Christianity has become an easy target in many films and other media now a days. It's become a target while other religion's symbols have not, perhaps for fear of retribution by them. Can you imagine a movie showing the destruction of the Koran for instance and the up roar that would create ?  Too bad these sort of scenes seem to be used for shock value.  Anyway, I don't recommend the film for the reasons stated.",1362614400,3,2212,4.544080604534005

3282017,3,B00105304M,"A chilling, and at times claustrophobic adventure, the subterranean horror thriller Catacombs (2007) is set in Paris, where far below the surface, an extensive system of underground tunnels and chambers is supposedly home to a crazed cannibalistic killer.  While the film is generally well shot and effectively creepy at times, much of film's effectiveness is lost due to the poorly written characters who behave illogically, in an attempt to heighten the drama.  While Catacombs does deliver some solid thrills, the annoying characters, and suspect story, contributes to a film that leaves you with a bad aftertaste.  Spoilers follow.

Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon) comes to Paris at the invitation of her sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore, aka Pink), and is introduced to her friends, who take great delight in scaring her for fun.  The sisters and the rest of the group attend a secret rave party, being held illegally in the underground tunnel system.  The group slips away to take a dip in a subterranean pool, but Victoria decides to head back to the party.  Wandering through the tunnels, Victoria has just been joined by Carolyn, when they are attacked.  Carolyn is apparently killed, and Victoria is being chased through a maze of tunnels, by someone wearing a goat's head mask.

Victoria manages to escape, and rejoins the rave party, when the sudden appearance of the police, causes a mass exit, during which Victoria is knocked out.  She wakes up alone, and attempts to find a way out, but discovers that she is trapped behind locked gates.  She encounters Henri (Emil Hostina), who is also trapped inside, and using his map, they attempt to make their way to the surface, but later come to a parting of the ways.

Amazingly, Victoria's skimpy party dress doesn't get torn to shreds during her ordeal.  The situation is extremely farfetched, but given it's a horror film, it's not that difficult to go along for the ride, and ignore things like the practical considerations of setting up a bar, and lighting and sound system in a cave, which then magically disappears.  Once Victoria is alone, things do settle down and become more tense, although she proves to be very loud and annoying, and when in danger, always seems to do things that draws attention to herself.

Shannyn Sossamon carries the film well enough, and appears to be taking the term ""scream queen"" to heart.  Although noisy, Victoria actually does some intelligent things, and several times is on the verge of getting to safety.  Along the way she acquires an axe, and they become inseparable.  When Victoria falls into a pool of water, she somehow manages to swim to safety, while still clutching the heavy tool.  And she can also run like a jackrabbit, not injure herself, and maintain her balance, while still carrying the pickaxe.  This is no easy task, but for Victoria, the pickaxe seems light as a feather.

The twisty ending provides a definitive finish, to a story filled with mostly unlikeable characters.  Put through hell, you can certainly empathize with Victoria, but only so far, which makes the film something of a disappointment.  The conclusion leads you to believe that there is no masked killer in the tunnels, but had writers and co-directors David Elliot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G-I-Joe-The-Rise-of-Cobra/dp/B002NXSRVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G.I.

3282040,4,B00105304M,"This is an atmospheric movie, with a credible, followable story and lots of exciting moments!  A girl gets a letter from her sister, saying simply: ""You need to come to Paris.""  When she gets there, the sisters do NOT visit the Louvre, or fancy Parisian restaurants, or even window-shop at the more fasionable and expensive dress shops.  For some reason, (explained at the very end of the movie), the sister in Paris wants her American-living sister to visit the underground catacombs of Paris -- where a ""party"" of sorts is being held.  The sisters DO go shopping -- but not for high-fashion clothes!  (No matter how poor a person is, WHY anyone wants to go to the ""lower depths"" of society -- the ""grunge"", ""punk"" or just totally-rebellious scene, is something I'll never figure out.  But, as the French say, ""chacun a son gout"", (Everyone to their own taste.)

Well, our heroine has quite an adventure.  Events transpire that she gets LOST in the underground catacombs of Paris -- where a few million people are, (in reality, actually) buried, row upon row, upon row, upon row!  She meets up with a 'phantom beast', and a guy who MAY, (or may not), want to help her.  The passages where she runs THROUGH the maze-passages of the catacombs get to be a bit longish and wearying -- but that makes the movie all the more scary and real.  The viewer, too, eventually just wants to get OUT of those passages, and back to the safety of the above-ground party, and then go HOME.  Will our heroine finally get out of the catacombs?  Or will she remain, wandering there forever, (and eventually in the darkness, as flashlight batteries eventually do die....)?

W A R N I N G...S P O I L E R....A L E R T.............The ending of the film is a realistic shocker....and is one of the best lessons in anger-management I have ever seen portrayed on the screen. To say more would TOTALLY give away the ending...perhaps I have said too much already.  However, it reveals nothing of the plot to say this is an intense, engrossing little thriller, that will keep any horror-affictionado on the edge of her or his seat!  There is a laudable very small amount of bloodshed, and a laudable small amount of 4-letter words. (But there is some of each, so if you don't like these things AT ALL, stay away.)  The emphasis here is on plot, storyline, and characters.  The way all good horror-stories used to be.  The viewer's imagination is also put to some use...and this makes things even more delightfully(?) scary. Personally, I have divided scary movies into two types: ""horror"" movies, (of which CATACOMBS is a fine example), which rely on plot, dialogue and character for suspense, and ""horriBLE"" movies, which rely on gore, shock-type 4-letter words and special effects, often with a story and dialogue that are totally simplistic.  CATACOMBS at least has little gore and very few 4-letter words.  It has a plot and a moral.  It has good dialogue and credible acting.  It is the classic horror movie genre, updated a bit for today's audience.  Good show!",1256515200,,3040,4.692452830188679

As they, along with some friends, descend into the French catacombs, bad things end up happening, culminating with Victoria seeking a way to escape the maze-like underground catacombs.  While it does have a good dose of atmosphere and makes good on some historical facts, Catacombs as a whole just ends up being too boring for its own good.  By the time we get passed the halfway point of the film, we don't care if Victoria or anyone else escapes or not.  What does save the film from the scrap heap however is a dynamite twist ending, which may leave you feeling a little cheated, but in actuality helps make Catacombs better than it should be.

3282043,1,B00105304M,"Catacombs (Tomm Coker and David Elliott, 2007)

Catacombs, as far as I could ever tell, was made expressly to give mediocre pop singer Pink some sort of entree into the film world. And if you look at it as nothing more than this, it succeeds, on the level that, well, Pink is on film, though she's an even worse actress than she is a singer. In every other way, however, the film is as absolute a failure as is possible, and its only real saving grace is that it's not the worst movie I've seen today (that honor would go to Dark Fields, which, despite us only being four days into the year, I am 90% certain will be one of the five worst movies I see in 2009).

The pop tart and Shannyn Sossamon (Wristcutters: A Love Story) star as sisters. Pink is Carolyn, the wild one, currently enrolled in graduate school at the Sorbonne. Sossamon is Victoria, the staid undergraduate student with mental problems. Carolyn invites Victoria to France for a vacation, and as the movie opens, Victoria is arriving in Paris. Carolyn has plans to take Victoria to a rave in the catacombs; things get weird when Victoria, already away from her usual meds and having taken a dose of absinthe (and really, why is it that absinthe supposedly has these incredible qualities?), gets separated from Carolyn and her friends, and becomes convinced that a serial killer who lives in the catacombs, whom the group had been telling her about, is chasing her.

The main problem with the movie is its pace; one wonders (or should) how the movie is going to continue on when everything you read about on the back of the box has already happened within the first twenty minutes, and you've still got seventy to go. Excellent question, and the answer is, ""the movie will bore you to tears as, essentially, nothing happens for sixty of those seventy minutes."" Then come the final ten, and while I admit to cheering a bit when Victoria reaches the obvious conclusion during the climactic scene, but honestly, did no one see that coming?

As well, Coker and Elliott are another directorial team who have mistaken the idea that ""overly dark"" and ""atmospheric"" are identical, and thus about half the movie is very difficult to see. Brilliant. The acting is, at its best, competent (Sossamon is normally half-decent, but her role here mostly involves standing and screaming, running and screaming, and falling down and screaming). The big plot twist is painfully obvious from, oh, a minute and a half into the movie (or, if you're really not paying attention, you may not figure it out till half an hour or so), and while I admit that it's a good plot twist (in the sense that I was mutely cheering for Sossamon's character for actually making a halfway intelligent choice during the climax), the predictability of it did rather dull the fun. And, of course, as to be expected from any movie containing a mediocre pop singer, the soundtrack is horrific.

Put me in mind of Sheitan, for some reason, except that Sheitan was good, and did eventually come up with a plot. (half)",1233964800,3,3037,4.6585820895522385

In some senses, the movie has an entertaining quality to it.  But the typical mistakes of B-horror will drive you crazy if you can't help but pick your horror movies apart.  We all want to be frightened by horror, but we need that scare to be believable in order to buy into it.  This movie is only believable in the sense that the characters, like people we all know, are very, very dumb.

This movie is very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>.  There are no special effects to speak of.  There's a lot of screaming, running, darkness and flashing lights to distract you.  Yet not a lot happens.  It's not really scary per se.

If you thought that was silly, just move on.

If you've read the synopsis you know that the film takes place in the underground catacombs of Paris.  They really do exist, although not in the way they are depicted in the movie.  The set is well put together considering the budget.  And they are in Paris after all!  Yet despite the beautiful location, the film is visually mediocre with no special cinematography to speak of.  A shot of the Eiffel Tower fully lit is the best you'll get.

The script makes a little bit of sense when you get to the end.  Yet the way the plot is resolved leaves the character's actions making no sense. Still, I would say most people will find the *twist* at the end to be predictable, though there are many possible endings based upon the way the first half is set up.

The consistency of the locale is never really maintained.  Even though they are in Paris, we see writing on the wall in English.  Not to mention people give speeches in English, the French talk to each other in English, and then the main character ... meets a guy who speaks only French.  What?  If they were going to translate everything into English, that would have been one thing.  But the inconsistency, while not a deal breaker, is a sign of a mediocre script.

I like Shannyn Sossamon as Victoria.  I think she has some talent, though I don't think she is at her best here.  It's hard to think of that as a positive but it might be all things considered.

Plenty of the acting is mediocre to bad, but most of the movie is so focused on the Victoria character that it isn't as big of a liability.  Even at 50%, she carries this movie.  When you have terrible lines to deliver, it doesn't make acting any easier.  The supporting cast is generally just OK.  I don't think that Pink is as bad as people say, but she's not exactly great either. The lines are especially weak in the final sequence where everything gets explained.

When you do reach the conclusion, there are many questions left unanswered.  Granted the cast is disposed of quite easily.  But it's never clear how our heroine, who is lost for most of the movie, finally gets out of the catacombs.

Conclusion

If you are looking for mindless horror for a Friday night, this might do the trick. This is no masterpiece, but it's better than many B-horror movies.  However, it's still a B-horror movie.  There is very little in terms of unintended humor.  The saving grace is that is over quick.

If you are picky about the details in your horror movies, don't expect too much from this one.  This is more of a thriller than a pure horror movie, but at times it tries to be both. Rent this before buying the DVD.

This might be a three star movie for those who seek mindless diversion.  For me it just misses the cut.  And while it wasn't the worst I've seen, I would not seek it out for another viewing.

The story starts with Victoria (played by the stunningly cute Shannyn Sossamon) as she arrives in Paris after being invited by her troublesome sister Carolyn (played by singer Pink). Carolyn is on a mission to break Victoria out of her shell and starts by dragging her to a party. However this party is a bit different from the norm being that it takes place in the catacombs under the bright lights of the Paris streets where 7 million bodies lie. As the rave starts going Carolyn and company choose to take a dip in some dingy body of water in the catacombs. As they press for Victoria to come in she gets pissed and decides to walk back to the rave on her own. This really isn't the best idea. It's pretty much like walking through a maze with little hope of finding an exit. The story begins to heat up here and has you leaning on the edge of your seat for the rest of the way.

This one is well worth checking out. It's certainly not the scariest film out there but does have a few tense moments. What's nice about it is it's creative and a little different from the run of the mill horror of today. Atmosphere is really what earned this one an extra star or two since it gives you a very uneasy feeling at time.",1213315200,,1587,4.304347826086956
3282048,3,B00105304M,"Catacombs begins with a drug and alcohol filled blur of a hedonistic rave.  Below and amongst the ravers is a dark, dingy set of tunnels and dirt-covered floors, the source of the movie's title: the Catacombs.  It turns out that the Catacombs are a series of tunnels below Paris in which the remains of millions have been turned into abstract art and stacked to the ceilings.  It appears that some are not content with current body count.

Victoria (Sossamon) receives a post card from her sister Caroline (Pink) one day, inviting her to France.  Days later she boards a plane to Paris, and her life will never be the same.  I can't go further without mentioning the fact that Sossamon is gorgeous as always and truly shows her range in this emotion-filled thriller.

Upon arrival, there is almost immediately an awkward scene in which the sisters go shopping in Paris.  It had the feel of a bad 70s movie for a while - something the director surely chose - and it just didn't work.  I immediately wanted Pink to be the first person murdered.

Anyway, the sisters make their way to a party hosted by Huge, a hulking black guy, and Jean Michele, a suave party leader obsessed with death.  Searching for a little cool down from the rave, the group and a few others make their way to an underground sitting room of sorts.  It is here that Victoria, who doesn't drink, gets her first taste of absinthe.  She seems to enjoy it quite a bit because she has at least two huge mugs.  During this scene is when Jean Michele tells the story of a goat-head-wearing killer who has been roaming the catacombs for years.  Moments later, cops raid the rave in a spastic, epilepsy-inducing sequence that triggers Vicki's agoraphobia, and causes her to hit her head, knocking herself unconcious.

She awakes to a pitch-black, abandoned, post-rave catacomb, and to make matters worse, the police have barricaded the way out.

The rest of the movie plays upon the basic fears of most people.  To some extent, claustrophobia and nyctophobia (fear of the dark) get us all.  Full of contrast scares (i.e. dark to light, quiet to loud), and the scary possibility of the legend being true, Vicki must struggle with her fears, the dangers lurking in the dark, and discovery of who she should really fear.",1211155200,2,2278,4.678391959798995
3282079,5,B00105304M,"I did not expect this movie to deliver as much as it did. After a slightly slow start, this movie held me by the throat the whole way. One caveat: only watch this movie at night with all the lights turned off.",1204934400,9,209,4.0
3282080,3,B00105304M,"Since I am flying off to the City of Lights a week from today I thought watching a horror movie set beneath the streets of Paris in the city's famous catacombs seemed like an appropriate choice for last night's late night fare.  However, this 2007 films from the writer-director tag team of Tomm Coker and David Elliot is not actually filmed in the catacombs of Paris, it is merely set there.  Too bad, because I figure that there is no way on earth (or beneath it) that my wife is going to want to spend any of her first trip to Paris looking at thousands and thousands of skulls and bones.

""Catacombs"" begins with an ominous voice over from Victoria (Shannyn Sossamon), who explains: ""My sister sent me a postcard.  All it said was, 'Come to Paris.  It will be good for you.'  Forty-eight hours after I arrived, she and everyone I'd met were dead.""  Such foreshadowing hardly constitutes spoilers in this genre, so Victoria meets up with her sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore, a.k.a. Pink) and her group of wacky bohemian friends.  After a day of shopping Carolyn and her friends drag Victoria to a secret rave that takes place in the catacombs that night.  There they meet up with Jean-Michel (Mihai Stanescu), who tells Victoria the story of a deranged killer raised by a satanic cult who feeds on those poor souls who get lost in the catacombs.  This, as all devotees of the horror genre know, is the sort of convenient exposition that are a staple of such films, taken as a joke or urban legend, but, of course, necessary background information for what is about to take place.  It does not take long for Victoria to become separated from her sister and lost in the catacombs, so the merriment can begin.

The problem is that things slow down after the initial attack.  There is, I suppose, some effort to take advantage of the setting as a labyrinth in which our heroine is lost, but nothing that follows is particularly interesting.  At least if this were happening in the real catacombs of Paris that would be interesting, but the sets are just sets (in Romania no less).  Since Victoria is separate from everybody she met and we are focusing on what is happening to her, which sort of limits the opportunities for blood and gore, which helps contribute to the lethargy of the middle part of the film (during which time you keep trying to wrap your mind around the idea that Sossamon and Pink are sisters).  But you should keep watching because the best part of this film is the ending, which may be entirely relatively.  After watching hundreds of horror films that have laughable or less than laudable endings, I liked the way this one comes round full-circle to Victoria's ominous words at the start.  Too bad the ride along the circumference is not worth the trip.",1204329600,2,2773,4.6130346232179225
3282081,3,B00105304M,"This movie explores the catacombs under Paris where millions are buried. A young American girl visits her sister in Paris where they go to a party in the catacombs. Some gore and violence but it plays on our fear of the dark and someone lurking in it. It draws suspense using lighting from only a flashlight and the visiting girl being lost when she's separated from her sister. It has a good twist at the end, but the director rehashes the scenes at the end to dumb down this simple plot. This was probably meant to clarify the story but was unnecessary and will irritate most movie goers.

Overall, it's a fun movie and both my husband and daughter enjoyed it.",1203897600,2,662,4.471074380165289

I've heard a lot of ppl say P!nk sucked at acting. Personally I did find one line that sounded like she didn't know what she was saying, but other than that she was acting like herself. She says F*ck a lot and doesn't care if she's a bitch, thats P!nk and that's why we all love her ;) If you own her concert dvd's u'll understand.
Victoria (co-star her sister) is annoying as hell. I'll give that actress one thing, she did do her part very well.
The plot and set was also something new. It's ""Saw"" meets ""The Descent""
So yah its not an award winning movie, it's one of those ones u pull out of ur collection to freak ur friends out because they've never seen it.

Later Victoria gets seperated from everyone as she gets lost in the 200-mile maze of tunnels and must find a way out before a homicidal maniac who lives in the maze comes and gets her.

An enjoyable little slasher thriller from the producers of ""Saw"" known as Twisted Pictures definitely relies on psychological chills and clausophobia. There is some gore shown but not too much even there's a grisly flashback on the killer's history, the acting is ok and so is the twists but this is an enjoyable and sometimes suprising psychological thriller with some decent scares and fun.

3282087,5,B00105304M,"One Missed Call's release has inspired my interest in the Shannyn Post ""Rules of Attraction"" Renaissance. What I see as a phenomenon where indie directors with a decent amount of money can pay Shannyn's agent to appear in a low budget movie. Suddenly it becomes ""if you could have Shannyn star in your movie, what would you have her do?""

Catacombs is a french horror/suspense movie starring Shannyn Sossamon and Pink. Pink's character Carolyn invites Shannyn Sossamon's character Victoria, her sister, to come to Paris. Apparently Victoria has been having some issues, though they're not fully explained, one of them appears to be with drugs, and the trip is to sort of ""get away from everything"". They spend the day shopping and site seeing when finally Carolyn takes Victoria to a party/rave. The party is held underground in Paris' catacombs, one of the largest mass graves in the world. You meet the guy who hosts the party, and during one scene you hear of the legend of this child born of incest that was raised on nothing but raw meat, and made to wear a goat skin mask (aka the Antichrist) that supposedly lives down in the catacombs. When the police raid the catacombs, Shannyn's character hits her head while fleeing only to wake up alone in the maze of skulls and bones.

Why I like this movie:

Shannyn's character in the movie is very similar to that of Lauren from Rules of Attraction, so people who became fans of her from ROA will be sure to appreciate this movie. Actually, she's so similar that I've been coming to think of this movie as ROA2: Catacombs.

The movie, although seemingly a straight to video horror/suspense flick, is actually very stylized and ""vibey"", especially with the music. Everything from the shopping scene that is like an overwhelming ecstatic blur in Victoria's mind (also reminds me heavily of Victor's Trip to Europe scene from ROA), to the scene where they're driving to the party and the chill french hip hop is playing, to all the music that is played at the party that is heavily reverbed through the catacomb walls.

This movie does a good job of portraying what it's like to have a bad trip at a party. The flashing lights and the faces that echo in your mind as you try to make your way to the bar where all you need is a cup of water. Maybe I found these scenes so intense because I was high while watching the movie both times, dunno.

I would like to be more sensical in describing how great this movie is, but it comes out in bits and pieces. I will just say that of all Shannyn's new movies that I've watched since ROA, this is the best one. It's her second best movie. It really surprised me. I would have never watched something like this but my interest in her made me download and watch it only to see her and I was surprised at what a great flick it was. I even went ahead and preordered the US DVD which comes out February 19th. For anyone who liked Shan in ROA or who likes suspense, I recommend downloading this (I got it off mininova). I CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS MOVIE!",1202515200,7,3036,4.510909090909091
3282088,3,B00105304M,"""Catacombs"" (produced by Lions Gate Films / Twisted Pictures) stars Shannyn Sossamon as Victoria, slightly nervous American girl who has just arrived in Paris. Victoria visits her fun-loving sister Carolyn (Alecia Moore aka Pink) who with her friends in Paris drags timid Victoria down to the illegal party (like a rock concert) secretly thrown in Paris catacombs.

This is where the remains of seven-million people sleep in the maze of tunnels and graves, a creepy subterranean network that spans nearly 200 miles in length. For Victoria, however, things get serious when she gets lost there and runs into something very strange. Victoria must find out a way to get out of this place, but what can she do alone in the dark?

The story of ""Catacombs"" fairly looks like the 2004 horror film ""Creep"" (starring Franka Potente) or the 2005 thriller ""The Descent"" (far scarier than the other two). The difference is the nice choice of the location. The realistic production designs (the ""Paris catacombs"" were actually constructed in the soundstage in Romania) are fantastic, but sadly director Tomm Coker and David Elliot fail to use the claustrophobic atmosphere to the full.

For Victoria screams a lot and runs around in the maze, but the film itself is hardly scary. The pretty simple story, which has a potential of becoming a more gripping thriller, suddenly stops going further until the very ending which you will either love or hate.

I don't know why, but Shannyn Sossamon keeps appearing in horror films - ""The Order"" ""Devour"" and ... ""One Missed Call."" I don't think her acting here is bad though it is not great either. My impression may have something to do with the character she plays because you may (and I did) find the character of Victoria a bit annoying. Yes, fear brings out the worst in people, but does that have to be shown in this way? Alecia Moore fares better as her sister, who plays a key role in the film, but the time allotted to her character is not very long.

Frankly I was disappointed with ""Catacombs"" because I expected more from the film; something original and new. In fact the film has one, but you have to wait for that very long. The film, which as far as I know was not shown in theaters in USA, is not a terrible disaster, but could be much better if shorter and tighter.",1200614400,22,2312,4.6987654320987655
