____

The dramatic impact of this 'golden age' television production is evident from the first moment Paul Newman appears on camera as Henry Wiggen, an all-star major league pitcher for the N.Y. Marathons.

His buddy and roommate on the road is Bruce Pearson (Albert Salmi), a third string catcher who will never experience the thrill of a cheering crowd.  A simple, good-natured country boy, Bruce is alternately teased by his teammates and chewed out by Dutch, the team manager.  Bruce shares a tragic secret with Wiggen, and it affects both of their lives profoundly.  As a result, their relationship takes on a new dimension, with Wiggen feeling a special responsibility toward his teammate.  This is a powerful human story, with characters you'll never forget.

The version of ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" to watch - again and again - is the version starring Michael Moriarty and Robert DeNiro.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it.",1039219200,,245,4.4222222222222225
