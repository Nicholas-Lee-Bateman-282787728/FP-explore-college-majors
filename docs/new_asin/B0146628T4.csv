7385017,5,B0146628T4,Great murder mystery with a little Saw-enque aspects. I love it. I highly recommend it,1449446400,,86,4.8
7385018,4,B0146628T4,"Im not sure if this is the dub or not, but for the love of god DO NOT BUY THE DUB its like a sad excuse for an abridged series. If you want a fantastic dub, save your money and play the Englisu version of the game.

7385019,5,B0146628T4,I played this game it is very good. if you never played it you must. And I loved the Anime a lot. I think It is one of the better Anime out there right now. every body has there like and dislike. But I give this one A+ in my hobby of Anime.,1447372800,,240,3.547169811320755
7385020,5,B0146628T4,I love the Show as well as the game looking on the Anime after watching the video games on YouTube I can see why many people are not a big fan of this. It doesn't have all the original cast all except one and all the cool stuff that was from the game they never added in the Anime like the bath seen. They had made the Anime and the plot of the story shorter it's not like the video game to where you get to watch all the characters throughout the whole thing and then when the murder happens let them find clues they just made that part really short plus the added in a couple of new things that weren't in the anime. And the other half is it's really A great job the story still follows the same plot all 16 students or 15 are locked up in the school trying to survive to get out and while solve the school  Mistry  And murder cases the one  at the classmates have caused. I love all the characters and they still keep to the point it's a very good anime for those who like the series of danganropa I hope if they make another series of this of the anime Following the second game make it a little better than the first. it's still great thing to watch even if it's  50% good and 50% bad  lost in there. some good parts in it as well well I hope this helps everyone out if they're interested in watching this it's really good you can watch most of it on YouTube if you want to. me I give it five stars,1447113600,,1403,3.9609929078014185
7385021,4,B0146628T4,"Hopes Peak Academy is where Super High School Level geniuses attend, but they hold a lottery every year to invite a normal student to attend.
Makoto Naegi is a completely normal kid with super high school luck, as he has won the Hopes Peak Lottery. Sadly, it turns out to have been super BAD luck, since upon arriving to the school, he blacks out, waking to find he is trapped in the school with his new classmates and a maniacal living teddy bear named Monokuma who informs them the only way to leave is to kill someone. Let the games begin!

I had lots of fun with this series. It is a pretty unbelievable premise, but I trusted the show to give some sort of explanation by the end and my trust was not betrayed. The characters don't get a whole lot of development, since this is very much a plot driven show. The murder mysteries and the mystery of the school were lots of fun and the story flowed along fairly well. Monokuma was hands down my favorite character.

I have never played or heard of the game that this was based before watching the show. I had read somewhat mixed reviews about it, one from someone who had played the game stating that it was confusing and left lots of stuff out.

The only thing that confused me was the ending, which after some lengthly wiki reading, turns out to have been very close to the game. Actually, it seems to me that the show followed the game very closely. The game is called DanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (dangan' means bullet and ronpa' means refutation in Japanese). The game is the first in a series and it seems that other games flesh out the original story quite bit. I hope another one of the games get adapted :)

One thing I thought was kind of fun about this show is that it is really, really, really obvious that it is based on a visual novel. It does things like introduce each character with their own character sheet, frequently give you data in a game like format (like the way you find clues), and for the trials Naegi gets Truth Bullets and you can totally tell he is the player character. I liked how the show embraced its roots, but it might bug other people.",1447027200,6,2129,4.3686868686868685
7385022,5,B0146628T4,"Upupupupu! The bear puns will stop now, I promise. This is a rare thing, I believe, to find a shorter anime (12-13 episodes) that is able to draw you in so well to the story and the characters in its limited run time. Yes, I am slightly peeved that, if given more episodes (maybe even a Baccano! number of 16), this could truly be a magnificent anime, emotional attachment to the characters and their deaths the only thing missing from the show. But, for what it is, it is despairing show of colorful characters and thrilling circumstances as we try to solve the mystery behind Hope's Peak Academy! Let me lay it on the line for ya.

Art Style: These character designs are truly unique, and the animation itself flows well because the characters are flatly colored. The school backdrops packs each scene with atmosphere, almost ""King of Thorns""-esque, and some pink blood is thrown around for flair. The execution scenes are what really stand out, but, of course, they are almost exactly like the game. This takes away the emotional impact of the characters' deaths because their fear does not really translate through the heavy stylistic animation.

Music: Very gamey, typically 16-bit (like I know what I'm talking about, her-de-derp). The opening is peculiar, being a fully English rap, but really only the Classroom Trial music is worth noting as fast paced and exciting, especially the version at the end of episode 12 (don't look unless you want to spoil EVERYTHING, though).

Characters: All-in-all, a somewhat-unique and entertaining cast of characters. Also, hats off to one of the more awesome loli character designs I've ever seen with Celes. As for actual CHARACTER, there are some amusing scenes for certain ones, but I felt like I've seen them all somewhere before. ESPECIALLY Naegi, but what have we come to expect from our main protagonists nowadays? Who stands out, then? Monokuma, of course! He's the evil Cheshire Cat (but a bear) of the game, doing whatever he darn well pleases, and he gets quite an assortment of funny lines and reactions, yet you still love to hate him. That is, until the mastermind shows up at the end and steals the entire show from Monokuma, setting up their story and character as one of the greater villains that you want to see expounded upon when you see what they've done. I want a second season just to see their presence in the rest of the world, and hopefully get a couple more crazy scenes with them in it.

Story: Everyone compares this to Hunger Games, and it kinda is, but I saw a little more Maze Runner in it. But this show is way better than Maze Runner, and leagues better than the 3rd Hunger Games movie. Don't even get me started. If you haven't, DO NOT spoil this plot or the mysteries. They are a ton of fun and really do pick your brain, so pay attention! New rules added, new places to explore; things never get old. There is a lot to choke down before the entire show blows past you in a rush!

Cast Your Votes!: Now, many people compare it to the game, and why shouldn't it be? Unfortunately, I have no PS Vita, so I cannot play the game. Therefore, I speak to the anime fans over the gamers, and say that this show is completely worth your time. Is it worth a buy? I can hardly say, but I know that I might get around to doing so eventually. I will tell you one thing, though; the english dub is pretty darn-well fantastic. Not only for the careful expertise in which the voices were chosen (some people say a line awkwardly every now and then), but for the cleverness of a few extra jokes added to the script. This was a fun show, and I desperately wanted to see these characters survive and make it out of the school in one piece as friends. Despairingly, this will not happen, so don't get too attached to your favorite characters (thankfully, mine didn't show up until the 12th episode) and prepare yourself for some shocking twists! Get the ball rollin', and take my word as you see fit. Hopefully we'll see season 2 on the horizon!",1445385600,16,4006,4.566063977746871
7385023,2,B0146628T4,"If you truly wish to enjoy Danganronpa then DON'T watch the anime, play the game! The game is a million times way better than the anime. Trust me you will regret it if you watch this first.",1444867200,4,189,4.135135135135135
7385027,4,B0146628T4,"While I generally hate the sort of people who rant about this kind of thing, this anime feels like a perfect example of, ""doesn't quite live up to the original source material"", ""the book is better than the movie/TV show"", etc... Originating on the PSP in Japan back in 2010 and after being brought over west to the PS Vita along with its sequel by NIS America, the first Danganronpa is a great high school murder-mystery/whodunnit with a lot of twists and turns. While the anime hits all the main plot-points from the first game, the speed at which conclusions are arrived at comes and goes a tad too hastily, blowing right past a lot of the clues, quirky personalities, and true motivations scattered throughout.

Best way I can explain it: anime brings you along for a very quick ride through the major points of the story (like a CliffsNotes version of a book), whereas in the game YOU are the one actively making sense of things and figuring out in-depth each murder/mystery piece-by-piece.

If you have an interest in this series and the proper resources (Vita, PC, or PS4), do yourself a favor and play the game first, then watch the show afterwards. I can't imagine that the game would be too enjoyable if you've seen the show first and know all of the victims/murderers in advance. If you don't have the time (~20ish hours) or consoles to play though, and just want to sit back and enjoy a fun murder-mystery anime, by all means have at it. The anime has some great animation while the game is mostly static character portraits with the occasional video, and it's a solid show/story any way you look at it. ...just, don't expect some of the jumps in logic or trials to make a whole lot of sense... The anime doesn't do a good job of bringing you along for the clue-finding/investigation part of each case.

It's also worth noting that there is currently no anime of the second storyline/direct sequel to Danganronpa. So, if you even think you might want to see this story all the way through, know that you are going to inevitably have to jump into the games at some point. The series is currently comprised of (in chronological order): Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Vita/PC/PS4/Anime), Danganronpa - Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls (Vita, PC, PS4), Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (Vita/PC/PS4), Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School (Anime), and the yet to be released Danganronpa V3.

Lastly, I will say I enjoyed the english voice-acting and script/localization choices in the game over the anime much more overall. Not a huge deal, but some of the terms and names came across awkwardly in the anime (Genocider Syo vs. Genocide Jack), and characters (Monokuma, Toko, Junko, and a couple others) didn't live-up to their INCREDIBLE video game counterparts. In particular, the acting performances in the last trial via the game blew me the hell away (one of my favorite video-gaming moments), but sadly, the emotional impact doesn't carry over into the show. 13 episodes is just too short to get a feel and groove for a cast as large and unique as this, and every aspect feels rushed through. But, as with any review out there, this is all my personal opinion and your mileage may vary!

Don't mean to sound like I'm bashing this anime as I really did enjoy watching it, but I do see it as a fun quick supplement/refresher for people who have already played the first game. I wholeheartedly recommend getting into the series if you haven't already, just don't start here if you have the option. Now, go and enjoy the crazy f'd-up world of Danganronpa! It's a dang fun ride, keep the hope and don't give in to despair!!",1479513600,,3648,4.7115987460815045
7385028,2,B0146628T4,"I went into this anime with the expectation that it wouldn't be great. After all, the producers had to condense what is essentially a 25-hour video game into roughly a quarter of that. Even still, I wasn't prepared for how disappointing the final product ended up being. Two major components of what make the game good, the murder investigations and building relationships with the other characters, are conspicuous by their absence in the anime. The only reasons for the two-star rating are the exceptional visual design and amazing soundtrack that was picked up from the game.

I might have been able to look past this if the entirety of the game's English voice cast reprised their roles here. The only major character to do so is Bryce Papenbrook, who plays lead Makoto Naegi, but he sounds different in the anime versus the game, and not for the better. I've long been a fan of the collective works of Greg Ayers (Monokuma); Monica Rial (Sayaka Maizono); and Caitlin Glass (Kyoko Kirigiri) but they, and most of the other characters for that matter, are HORRIBLY miscast in the anime. The Japanese voice actors are the same for both, so if you must own this anime, that's the way to watch it.

Even then, your money would be better spent on the game. It's available on the PC through Steam for both Windows and Mac OS. It doesn't require a powerhouse system to run, and even at its full retail price of $30, it's less expensive than the anime. It's even cheaper if you happen to catch it during one of the platform's big semi-annual sales. If you'd rather play it on a console, the Vita games are compatible with the PlayStation TV, which several retailers have put on clearance for $50 or less. And in January 2017, NIS America is releasing the first two Danganronpa games in one package for the PlayStation 4. With all this in mind, there is zero compelling reason to purchase the anime unless you must own anything and everything related to the franchise.",1479427200,,1963,4.670520231213873
7385029,2,B0146628T4,It was predictable. Okay-ish,1476921600,,28,6.25
7385030,4,B0146628T4,"There isn't too much left to say here that other customers haven't already mentioned, but I will reaffirm, this is a great show! This anime is about a group of 'lucky' high school students who are accepted into the exclusive Hopes Peak High School. Upon arriving at the school, the main male lead student passes out and wakes up in his dorm room not really knowing how he got there. He makes his way to the gym where the other students are already waiting. The students are greeted by their adorable principal and told they aren't really here to attend school but rather play a hunger games style, last man standing, game for their lives.

Basically the students are told they will have to kill one another to make it out of Hopes Peak. However the catch is that you cant get caught for the murders. After each murder there is a trial and if the real murdered is found guilty than only that student faces punishment, however if the students guess incorrectly than they are all punished and the real murderer goes free. Each episode keeps you guessing as to 'who done it' and what type of punishment they will face. Its fun to follow the series along and try to guess the killer. The episodes are very fast paced though so sometimes it can be a stretch to figure out these cases based on the evidence.

I didn't really like that the series had very little background on the situation revolving around the school and the ending is a cliffhanger so you don't really find out what happens if the students make it out of the game. I didn't read the manga or play the video game so the show is the only thing I can base my critique on. Other than that, the dub was watchable, the series isn't too gory, it has a unique art style that I really enjoyed and it was just an all around fun watch. If you like quirky mystery type animes than this is a must own.",1474848000,2,1849,4.341040462427745

7385032,4,B0146628T4,"I had this sitting in my watch list for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger and get it. I was not disappointed, only disappointed I hadn't gotten it sooner. Great charters, intriguing storyline, and beautiful animation. If you're a fan of Future Diary this you'll definitely wanna give this a try. You'll find some similarities in the overall plot and character personas. This show definitely stands on its own though. Semi satisfying ending, definitely left it open for future seasons and a fair amount of unanswerd questions for those of us who don't read the manga. Normally this is something I despise but the series was very compeling and kept me engagded so i didn't mind as much. My only real complaint is the length. I would have loved to have seen a little more background on the characters and more exploration/interaction around the school. Maybe more like 16 episodes. Unfortunately it seems most animes are following this 11-13 episode format which works great for some series and not for others. To my knowledge the continuation of the series is airing now. It is supposed to close up the loose ends which if it's true this could go down as one of my all time favorite animes (assuming it gets dubbed in english, if anone has any knowledge on if the dub will happen feel free to comment). For right now I give it a solid 4.5/5.",1469923200,,1353,4.641666666666667

7385036,4,B0146628T4,"A fun series based upon a popular video game. The animation is simple and the art style bare, but the low budget does nothing to take away from the twisted and yet fun series about a group of high school kids forced to live together in a doomed school with their only chance at escape, apparently to KILL each other until only one is left. As dark as it sounds, the series is light hearted and reminds me of Detective Conan, that is, if every episode some one died and his life depended on him solving the mystery. Won't spoil the end other than to say its... one of those anime endings... but then you are used to that right!?",1462233600,,627,4.233333333333333

7385042,5,B0146628T4,"If you're already looking at this you probably already know what you're getting into with the series, so I'll just write a review of the limited edition. This is a very nice boxed set, I don't think it says in the product description, but you get 2 Blu-ray discs and 2 DVD discs in two cases. The limited edition has no extras other than the beautiful outer box. You can see the pictures attached to this review to get an idea of what you get when you buy this set.

As for the extras found on the Blu-ray/DVD:
-Episode 1 Commentary: Some of the cast that worked on the Funimation dub give commentary. I found it extremely boring to sit through that I stopped 3 minutes in. Nothing special considering the only returning VA from the original dub was Bryce Papenbrook (and even so he doesn't sound as good as he did in the game), which is a damn shame because the game's dub was actually really good, save for Sayaka.
-Textless OP and ED, U.S Trailer and Funimation Trailers: Pretty much self explanatory, can also be found on the standard Blu-ray release.

So as you can see, pretty bare-bones when it comes to extras. So you're really only paying more money for the (beautiful) outer box and for two cases as opposed to one with 4 discs crammed inside.",1454025600,23,1253,4.443478260869565

8729835,5,B0146628T4,"Danganronpa is easily one of the most underrated and overlooked works of art from the Japanese video game developers Spike Chunsoft. Or to narrow it down a little further, from Kazuma Kodaka.

This anime Blu-Ray depicts the events from the original Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc and what may sound confusing or weird could not be more of a false lead. This series has some of the most emotional, heartfelt characters I've ever come to love, be it from America or Japan or anywhere. The cute adorable art style will first invest your interest and then after playing the 1st Danganropa video game on PS4 will you become emotionally and wholeheartedly invested in each of these amazingly realistic characters. Not only are they all unique and special in their own ways, but the series is so consistent with how these characters react, show emotion, and never once will you feel that they are acting outside of their character arc. Its kinda hard to explain, but trust me, if you will give this a chance and overlook the strange sounding name and buy this and the game Danganronpa 1.2 Reload (PS4) or (PS Vita), you will truly be thanking me once you are done. This Blu Ray does the series justice, however the game is where this shines the most. After spending time with these quirky colorful characters, and going about their daily school lives, you will be devastated when you come to realize that the games setting (and films) will see you solving one of their murders and then debating with one another over which classmate did it? And then, to throw you in even further depths of despair, you will then not only name the accused in a class trial, but thereby sentencing them to a cruel and tragic execution or punishment. This series delves deep into what each character feels, desires, regrets, mourns, gets embarrassed by, every human emotion known to man is expressed by each of these characters in this series and never before have I ever felt like i knew someone who was fictional better than here. You will be able to identify with your favorite character on every emotional level and know their innermost desires and their greatest fears. This film is great and it is going to show the same set of events that the game does, however, the game gives you MUCH more control and goes much further in detail about the events of the killing game that takes place at Hope's Peak Academy. And what starts here will spawn several follow ups that retain just as much charm, wit and emotional shenanigans that has come to be known as Danganronpa. Also, on another note, this series easily has one of the best consistent scores I have heard in many years. Each addition adds its own new beat and the sounds & games just get better and better after this one. So, please do yourself a favor and become invested in this amazing world of Danganronpa!!!",1524960000,,2847,4.671314741035856

8729837,3,B0146628T4,"Like almost every anime that is based off a visual novel, I would recommend playing the first game yourself instead of sitting down to watch this. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not horrible, but it does not do the source material any justice as they tried to push a 30 hours worth of a plot into 13 episodes. Much of the plot is either changed or skimmed over and could leave a new viewer turned off by it and/or confused due to this fatal flaw. The characterization was pretty off as well, the cast of characters don't exactly retain their character development or arcs. What is kept is little to none when it comes to their personalities, they almost seem like cardboard cutouts of their visual novel counterparts. I don't see anything wrong with watching it so along as you know the entirety of the source material because more than anything, this just serves as a summary of the game's plot. Some if not a lot of the dub voices are pretty good, though so that is a plus. Same goes with the original Japanese dub,

I don't mean to be so harsh about this anime, but I feel that it should have lasted longer than it actually did. In other words, instead of 13 episodes, there should have been 25-30. Somewhere around there. Because the 13 episode length seems to make it hard to squeeze such a gigantic plot into that specific amount of episodes.

anywho-- Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, the game this anime is based off of is available on Steam, PS4, and PS Vita. There is also a English patched ROM of the PSP version available fora PSP emulator.",1506211200,,1558,4.501766784452297
