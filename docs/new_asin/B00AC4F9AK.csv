8549913,5,B00AC4F9AK,"I haven't purchased any of the videos, yet, but I have been watching Teepa Snow on youtube for several months. She is wonderful! I'm not sure there is much more I can learn from purchasing the videos, but I am going to, in just a moment, just to find out. And maybe, someday, I can share them with someone else, who needs to learn how to deal with this horrible disease, but maybe can't afford the videos. I would highly recommend them to anyone!",1465084800,,446,4.321428571428571

8549916,4,B00AC4F9AK,"I really like Teepa Snow. I have all of the videos she has made to date. What I like'd most is her stating that this is a fatal disease. It's amazing how many people just don't realize this today...even professionals. There is no cure, yet!!! Also, I liked how she stated that this is all about ""letting go"", not ""giving up"" on the person in the end stage of the disease. I guess I would have liked a deeper explanation of the tombstones that are left as this insidious disease ravages the brain. This really helped me to understand why there is 'no going back' once the disease progresses. Also, I work in the Hospice industry, and the very final stage before death can wreck havoc on family members and caregivers. To really explain the very final hours, although emotionally difficult, would be so helpful for those who have to go through it with the person they are caring for. That being said, I recommend Teepa Snow and her videos constantly to professionals & those on the front-line battling this awful disease.",1424044800,2,1019,4.604395604395604

8549920,5,B00AC4F9AK,"She is our country's finest resource on GOOD dementia care.  Her teaching ability is unmatched, due to so many things.  First, the knowledge she has is enormous and insightful and accurate. Second, the way she can engage an audience is unsurpassed. She makes learning fun! And perhaps most important is the fact that Teepa truly, honestly CARES about people. She genuinely wants dementia patients to be treated with dignity, respect and grace. And she herself does exactly that. She works with patients and caregivers alike with such loving skill.  The world is a better place because of Teepa Snow.",1390262400,3,599,5.03030303030303
8549921,5,B00AC4F9AK,"Some background:  I've been a caregiver since 2005 when my wife, then 54, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  I've purchased three of the Teepa Snow DVDs and plan to purchase more.  In the past two days, I've seen all three and couldn't recommend them more highly for education programs for those who are caregivers as a profession as welln as those who, like me, are the caregiver of a loved one.  Of the three dvds I bought, this was the one that was the most difficult to watch but it was also the one I needed to see the most.  As hard as it was to watch at times, Teepa's presentations are so good, so professional that tears often turned to smiles.  My wife is in a memory-support Assisted Living Facility, the youngest resident there.  Teepa does an outstanding job giving examples that sounded exactly like some of the other residents I've seen there.  After watching this video, I know that I am much better prepared and ready for what will likely be the most difficult days of my life.",1362441600,8,992,4.5027932960893855
