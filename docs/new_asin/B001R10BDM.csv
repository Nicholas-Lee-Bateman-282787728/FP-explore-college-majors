3772051,5,B001R10BDM,"This is one of the best anime series that I have seen in a long time. I had accidentally stumbled upon this on television, and after seeing practically every episode, I went to my local DVD store and purchased this box set. This show does an impressive job of portraying some of the trials and tribulations of being in a band, from the squabbles between band members, the late-night food runs, playing show after show in front of small crowds in hole-in-wall venues, working many late night shifts just to make any money, making it big, breaking up, and the reunion.

The character development in this series was done extremely well. Watching Koyuki struggle in the beginning with learning to play the guitar only to blossom into a young star was beautifully portrayed and made you pull for him throughout the entire series. The band's leader, Ryusuke, is a quiet guy and his back story with his guitar (a Gibson Les Paul named Prudence) was woven into the story phenomenally. Yoshiyuki, the band's bassist, is who actually made me personally interested in playing the bass. Watching him play ""Last Dinosaur"" by The Pillows in one of the later episodes gave me goosebumps. Tsunemi is Beck's singer with a loud stage presence and a huge appetite for ramen. Last we have Yuji, the drummer and Yukio's close school friend.

Another plus to this series are the musical and pop culture references that are peppered throughout - both obviously and subtly. Koyuki's t-shirt says  ""Ramonne"" (subtitled ""Johnny""), a dream sequence with dead rock stars (Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Bob Marley, Sid Vicious and Freddie Mercury), mock covers of popular albums, real albums seen on the floor in various scenes, characters who were named after multiple musicians (Such as George Graham, the ""king of funk"" - possibly named after George Clinton and Larry Graham), and so on.

This series is recommended for everyone. Musicians will appreciate the portrayal of being in a band with its ups and downs, fans of pop culture will have a blast finding all of the various references, and even those who don't care about music will enjoy this down-to-earth story with a complete resolution at the end.",1291420800,,2190,4.894878706199461
3772052,4,B001R10BDM,"This version of the Beck anime is from the S.A.V.E. line of box sets, which means it is bare bones. You'll get all the episodes of the series, but you'll miss out on special features and extras. If this isn't a concern for you, you'll be getting a really good deal on a good series.

The series itself is about a young boy who finds himself drawn into a crazy chain of events that leads him to joining a band. For anyone who loves music and loves anime that are more realistic (think the slice-of-life genre), this anime is easy to recommend. You won't find over the top battles here. What you will find is likable characters, realistic drama, and even some good music.

Picture quality on the DVD is good, and you'll get the option of the original Japanese with subtitles or the English Dubbing. I prefer the original Japanese myself, but the dub work is quite well done (even the songs), and I don't think you'll miss much by viewing them that way.

One small note: On the American release of this series, you will find that Beck plays a different song during one of the final episodes' crucial moments. In the original series, the song done is a Beatles' cover. Unfortunately, this song did not make it to the American version (even the japanese language track on the DVD has it missing) and it is replaced with another song. This isn't a huge deal, but if (like me) you had seen the show before you might be dissapointed by the replacement.",1291075200,2,1444,4.462121212121212
3772053,5,B001R10BDM,"I ordered this DVD set after hearing great things about the show from some fellow anime fans. I was really excited to be able to get the entire series for such a bargain price. I wasn't disappointed one bit. There are not a lot of frills to this release, but I wasn't expecting a ton of extras. All 26 episodes of the show are here, on four discs. The packaging is pretty decent, with each DVD having its own spot in the case. I would have paid much more for this anime if I had to, but I am thankful that I didn't. This series is one I am glad to have in my collection and will re-watch many times I am sure. It's worth it.",1285372800,,624,3.9603174603174605
3772054,5,B001R10BDM,This isn't a review but a question. What's the difference between this DVD and the old one? I bought the old one and I'm just wondering if this one has new extra features. Please reply to this review. The show is good by the way.,1247011200,2,229,4.111111111111111

3772070,5,B001R10BDM,"This series... this... story. Amazing. This is my life, many years ago. Really... it is... was, I guess... my life. I was the same age too. Fourteen. The bands I played with, we never quite made it, to being famous I mean. But, a couple got close... very close. Some of the players did make it too... eventually. The passion, the struggles, the dreams, and moments on stage, minutes long yet special enough to last a lifetime. It is all too familiar. All too real. And it's still happening... somewhere, out there. Right now.

For those engrossed in the dream, music is everything... just like it was for us back then. Just like in this story. The local scene. The legends, who were players around town, and their bands. Playing. Rehearsing. Jamming. Practicing. Performing. It is all we thought about... all we ever really did. Morning, day, and night. Like the song says, 24/7. :)

This is an amazing story, with amazing music. It truly captures the heart of what being a part of the dream that is forming a rock band and creating original music, and the lifestyle that goes with it, is all about.",1467417600,,1099,4.6020408163265305

3772075,5,B001R10BDM,"My #1 favorite Anime! It's better in English (included). The essence of being one who truly rocks is refined when the language barriers are graciously removed by the dubbing team. (IMH [American] O).

So this is the story of a 14 yr old boy who is introverted breaking out of his shell with the help of fateful human encounters, which become lasting connections, throughout the journey of expressing himself using music. It's the story of what true music means! This anime truly rocks!

Sometimes you buy an anime cause you saw it on tv and it thrilled you and good times deserve a token of nastalgia. This anime could be that, but more importantly, it can change your life as surely as Koyuki's in this story! You may not see life or the world or music in the same way again.  On top of everything else, the animation is beautiful! It demonstartes the directors understanding of subtle human expression and psychology! And this isn't just a sequence of events and interactions, the animation takes time for the art! Something that people hardly take the time for these days.",1438560000,,1075,4.707446808510638
3772076,5,B001R10BDM,"One of my favorite genres in film, television, and even books is the coming of age story; the main reason I fell in love with Mongolian Chop Squad is how elegantly it handles this classic story. Most anime you watch has some angsty teenager develop some crazy power that they use to fight some bad guy on a regular basis, and maybe they have some wacky sidekicks team up with them every now and then. But this show has nothing to do with the supernatural; it's a grounded story of a young man who comes to befriend some aspiring rock and rollers, even becoming one himself. This is a story in which a down on his luck kid finds friends and fame as a musician; it may be a cartoon but when you get down to it, this story feels unmistakably real.

Our main protagonist is one Yukio Tanaka, known to his friends as ""Koyuki."" He's 14 at the start of the series, and he deals with the issues many of us dealt with at that age; bullies, academic pressure, not quite fitting in, etc. However, his life changes for the better when he meets Ryusuke Minami, an aspiring rock musician who has returned to Japan after spending most of his childhood in New York City. Koyuki also develops a crush on Ryusuke's younger sister Maho; the two share a chemistry and rapport that feels genuine, something you can't say for too many anime couples. Koyuki comes to discover he is a talented singer and guitarist, so Ryusuke recruits him for his fledgling rock band ""Beck"". (In case you're wondering, they change the name to Mongolian Chop Squad when they come to the States because of a well known recording artist of the same name.)

The show focuses largely on music (they are in a band) and I must say, much of it is pretty damn awesome. From the opening track to the closing song and everything in between, the many songs performed in the show suck you in and keep you entertained. I was pleasantly surprised that many of the dub voice actors are quite pleasant to hear sing; the first thing I heard Greg Ayres in was Deadman Wonderland, and I had no idea he could pull off some of these vocals. The soul of this show lies in its music, and it most definitely doesn't disappoint.

But while the music is good, I think most people can agree with me that an anime's true strength lies in its story and characters, and I'm happy to report that Mongolian Chop Squad delivers on both fronts. Koyuki is sympathetic and easy to relate to, especially for those of us that weren't at the top of the social hierarchy in high school; he's an anxious yet determined young man who does his best not to sweat the small stuff, and his friends are there to back him up when he can't handle something alone. The band members also have a unique charm in each of their personalities, and I couldn't help but smile at how genuine their friendships seem; they laugh together, they argue, they back each other up in a fight, it just feels real. You want to keep watching because you hope this all turns out okay for them in the end; becoming a popular band is pretty hard work (especially if you're not in America), but you root for these guys because you feel like they truly deserve it.

In terms of visuals, everything looks great, if simple. Remember that this a realistic portrayal of a band trying their hardest to make it big; there are no Super Saiyans or Soul Reapers running around in this one.

I got to say it; this show is not to be missed. If you want to watch an anime that does a great job of depicting the teenage outcast turned hero, look no further. Koyuki's story is one that I feel doesn't receive much attention in the wider anime audience, but it should. It really should.",1435190400,3,3656,4.402366863905326
3772077,5,B001R10BDM,"If you're a fan of anime and a lover of rock and roll music of all kinds this may very well be the pot of gold you are looking for! Beck :Mongolian Chop Squad is a near perfect mash-up of good story telling, fantastic anime and best of all the music! The story revolves around a typical small fry with big dreams but no place to start. He eventually runs into some characters who are trying to start a rock band. The young kid decides he's going to learn music, but finds it has many struggles. Typical school troubles, bullies, and a somewhat shady rock and roll underground and girls are only a few of the problems they face together as they struggle to stand out and keep the band they eventually form from falling apart in a highly competitive market of music.

The anime genre is so over saturated with the action packed and heavily fan service driven titles that serious down to Earth works like Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad can easily be overlooked. This isn't one of those anime shows I choose to praise because it's kind of unknown and unpopular, instead I think very highly of Beck because it's well put together. Based on the manga written by Harold Sakuishi, with this 26 episode series directed by Osamu Kobayashi, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad is an introspective, slice of life drama/comedy that follows people whom found their way in life through music. This is an anime that was put together by those whom have been around music and love it for what it is and can be.

Beck shines brightly in a few areas; the first is definitely in the characters and with some of their development. Koyuki is your typical flawed teen, and the writing works unbelievably well with his development. The viewer will no doubt become attached to him as he grows; you will want him to succeed in everything he does, such as in his music, making new friends, and even in possible romances. The viewer may also grow disgusted at times with his annoying weaknesses as well. He's very different from the typical male characters in anime for the most part which is actually a very good thing. Some of the other characters are developed better than others, and for the most part there's someone for just about everyone.

The story is also very well developed examining multiple themes with bullying and friendship being among the main issues, but music itself is the main story here. This anime was indeed assembled by music fans, as they pay homage to a plethora of acts and people such as The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and many others. The music scene is also heavily delved into. Koyuki and Ryusuke put together a band called Beck, and through them the viewer is taken through a tour of the underground music scene. I love how its so well portrayed, as the band spends countless hours not only putting together songs, but trying to jell as a unit to perform at local bars with the goal being to make it big. The story vibed with me on many levels as a former song writer myself, especially watching Koyuki attempt to write songs in his room and blistering his fingers doing it. I can't imagine a fan of music not feeling this anime. The behind the scene cutthroat part of the business is also examined, and I have heard similar stories like these from many people.

Beck is very solid, and I mean it outshines plenty of anime titles concerning its production values. Most of the music is done by the former Japanese rock group The Beat Crusaders, and I think these guys were very good at their craft. There are several songs being played throughout the anime with even some good background music at times. The music was indeed the focus here to deliver a truly genuine experience, and there is a focus on guitar riffs, bass, drums, and vocals. As a fan of rock I can say that I was never bored with the tunes. The animation is very good for the most part and there is a nice cohesion with the camera work. The characters fingers and hand movements flow nicely, and the camera uses several crafty zoom-ins; the jam sessions and performances are just so cool to watch.

The character designs are heavily manga influenced, and this visual style was quite original at that point in time. There is a big influence in pop culture, and the characters portray it well with their variety in clothes, hairstyles, and even mannerisms. The dialog is pretty well laden with profanities, and even though it may feel forced to some viewers, I have to say it fits like a custom made glove. These characters are city dwelling teens and this is exactly how they should be acting. None of this could have possibly worked though if not for the top notch voice acting consisting of the usual Funimation suspects; Justin Cook, Greg Ayres, Brina Palencia, and Eric Vale. Greg does a great job with displaying the puny geek in regards to Koyuki, but as usual, as great a voice actor he is, I find his squeakiness quite annoying. I'll also come out and say that the English dub is far superior, because I think it's far more energetic and captures the personalities of these misfits very well. The only issues I have in this area is mainly with the frequent use of stills concerning the animation. I understand that the budget for this anime must have been huge, but a handful of scenes did look pretty weird though.

Despite my praise for the writing and the story, Beck does have its flaws such as small story elements either not being wrapped up well or satisfying enough. The romance cliche concerning the male keeping his feelings in check should have been jettisoned, because this is used way too much in anime. Some characters such as the bass player Taira and the drummer Saku could have used more development. The viewer will understand how they think, but bass players, drummers, etc. would've definitely appreciated some depth in regards to those often overlooked instruments. In addition, although wrapped up for the most part the ending felt pretty rushed.

Sadly, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad is not an anime for everyone. It's pretty slow-paced, not the least bit action packed, and fan service isn't over the top ridiculous. Although the anime does take itself serious at times, it never ventures off into the dark realm creating some type of genre clash. It's light-hearted, dabbles very well with drama and comedy, and it's actually very uplifting. It's one of the better coming of age stories in anime that can probably help someone find that missing ""thing"" in their life. If you enjoy strong character development, rock music, and just an overall good story, then you may not go wrong with this.

Pros: Very strong characterization, animation, and music

Cons: Small story elements",1407024000,,6334,4.693969396939694
3772098,4,B001R10BDM,"The anime itself is great! This is up amongst my favorite series. Not my first time seeing it.... let's just say that I decided it was worth buying. Everything up until episode 23 was fine. Then I ran into a problem I didn't foresee. In episode 23/24, there's a cover of the Beatles song, ""I've Got a Feeling."" The US release had to change it, I guess due to copyright law. It's one of the most important scenes in the show. A climactic moment. They replaced ""I've got a feeling"" with some song they made up that was total junk. It ruined the scene I was most looking forward to.

My advice: If you buy it, when you get to the end of Ep 23, search Youtube for the original scene ""BECK - I've Got a Feeling."" That's how it was supposed to be. That's the only way it should be.",1405641600,8,775,4.132450331125828

3772116,5,B001R10BDM,"____ Mongolian Chop Squad was discontinued by Funimation a couple of years back. They promised it would be back but little was heard regarding it. A few months ago I emailed them and they assured me it would be available this summer, and apparently its true. Now that they've cleared up some legal issues they are re-releasing it without the BECK section of the title. How much of the series has been changed to facilitate this is still unknown, likely an episode name change and a title card change at least, but if you've been waiting to own this series this is the best way to pick it up. Old DVD sets with the Beck title run anywhere from $60-$200 on online sites such as e-bay, and despite the true name missing you still get this great series to own and enjoy at your leisure.

The animation in this series is limited for cost purposes, the show is arguably slow paced and has a slow burn arc over the season and yet all these things help add to the series tone, this is one of the best slice of life anime out there, possibly the best. This show catches the essence of adolescence, what its like to have too much time on your hand and the need to fill that time with aspirations for greater things. What is nice is that the show moves from that into exploring a very realistic portrayal of the underground club/music scene and what it is like for a band just starting out. The English Dub is actually quite well done, despite the lip flaps not matching during the majority of songs. The music is great too considering it was just written for the show, you can tell they employed real talent to help them create songs that would sound genuine while echoing familiar bands from whom MCS draws their style, as most start ups do whether purposefully or not.

If you haven't seen this series and it seems interesting Funimation has all the episodes up for free on Youtube, if you have seen this show you are more likely than not one of the many who love it (I can't see why the small percentage who dislike it would visit this product page). So for $20 the changes will likely be tolerable, as unfortunate as they are.

My only qualm about the series itself is a personal one. The ending felt rushed, around episode 23/24 everything puts you on a high, while the manga continues on with the bands adventures in America the anime just ends at episode 26 with a slide show alluding to some of these events. It's not a big deal but it leaves one anticipating a second season, though I'm happy this was a 26 episode series as they tend to be some of the strongest out there (Cowboy Bebop comes to mind). It also seems odd that there is little conclusion to the love story established throughout the series, they had the perfect opportunity at the end of the final episode and seemed to leave it hanging only because the manga did, but the manga continued on.

This is a five star series without a doubt. At least fans are being given the chance to own it again and hopefully new fans will continue to find it.",1333670400,9,3007,4.383512544802867
3772117,4,B001R10BDM,"I had an idea of what to expect when I bought this. I luckily had a cheap DVD player that I found the hack codes/keystroke to make multiregion so I could watch Region1 dvds.

I read waaay back in 2007 about BECK:Mongolian Chop Squad in NEO magazine. A British anime/manga/asian culture magazine which I still collect to this day. The reviews and articles stand up to age very well, since anime gets released a few years after they first appeared in Japan. When things eventually come to the UK I think, "" wow this sounds familiar "" and I look up my old magazine collection that featured it ( I have binders of them now ).

BECK, I recall works better in Japanese Dub. But there were a few episodes I watched in English dub for some comparison. The English dub had to rewrite some of the script and the dialogue is different from the subs. They did a good job, and the singing voice in the Eng dub for the English themed songs is actually better than the Japanese EngRish original.

At times the anime features American characters or english speaking characters, and the Japanese dub relates the main character's loss at not being able to understand them because English is taught so badly in Japan.  The English dub had to rework things here but the audience will have to suspend some disbelief and remember the main character is Japanese and doesn't understand English.

The series touches on childhood, coming of age, friendship, betrayal, love. All the things to make us remember our own teenage years and how we relate or not relate at all. I got a bit sentimental watching the series even though of course I never dated a Japanese American/ganguro Japanese girl or been to that many rock gigs, or even played in a band.

The music, is really cool. Very underground, very grunge. At times very jazzy. It pokes fun at some of the thrash the music industry manufactures and force feeds us in the form of pop groups and solo acts, and in Japan on a more ridiculous scale : idols. By the end of the series you are really rooting for BECK to succeed and show those wannabees what music and festivals should truly mean to an audience.",1298764800,,2132,4.524675324675325
3772118,4,B001R10BDM,I bought this box set before Christmas. Within purchase I was informed the item would not arrive before Christmas. The Next day amazon informed me it would arrive Christmas eve as it did. I heard much dislike to the save cover and I too didn't like it much. But it was no problem Beck came with a reversible dvd cover. Let me tell you the other side of the cover look beautiful. Now lets move onto the dvd. I originally saw this series on tv and it made me want to buy it when I found it at such a low price and luckily for me I jumped on the sale and Bought it for $12.99. It is great and being uncut it is nice to see the differences like the fact the F word is said over 5 times in the first episode I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this it is a great buy. I give it 4/5 stars because of the save cover and the fact it is all put into one clear dvd box and isn't a 'box set'. Otherwise it is great.,1294012800,,911,3.851063829787234

8337006,5,B001R10BDM,"Definitely in my top five. I don't normally watch slice of life stuff, but this show instantly blew me out of my seat. That being said, eventually I couldn't watch it the way I had been because the show got taken down. Of course my immediate go to was this site, and this came up. Best purchase I've made this year so far. I was a little skeptical about it because of a few reviews I've seen on here, but I assure anyone reading this to see if this is legit, it's absolutely worth it. Sure there is a difference to the original on one of the episodes at the end in the English dub (instead of covering the Beatles like in the Japanese version, they do a cover of a Dying Breed song from earlier in the series). Personally, I couldn't care. It still sounds really good. All that aside, it came in perfect condition. Also, it came a hell of a lot sooner than expected.
