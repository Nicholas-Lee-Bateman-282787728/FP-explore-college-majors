8618608,5,B00FU3KGO2,"I am already giving this "" prequel""  5 Stars because I loved "" High School Reunion"" . Sound stupid , right ?? I think that maybe the more people that write a 5 Star review for this DVD -- maybe it will be available someday . Can't find anywhere !! Its like one big teeze !! I really want to see Kelly Brook( yes- she is in this so its got to be good ) . I know I could pprobablywatch on youtube but there is no fun in that . I want the real thing !!! So if anyone knows where I could find this DVD -- let me know . Thanks",1499644800,,521,3.6106194690265485
