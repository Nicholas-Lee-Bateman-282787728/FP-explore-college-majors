8483215,5,B005QBBG1K,"an incredible film with action plot twists and drama and captures the turmoil of war with some comic relief,would have paid twice the price, Roddy was better known for ""how green was my valley"" but in my opinion was far better in this one",1524009600,,238,4.431818181818182
8483216,5,B005QBBG1K,"Saw it once on youtube. Haven't been able to find it to rent or buy since. It was a lovely story.  Warm, funny, and a lot of heart  I would love to see it again and have my granddaughter's to see it.",1468108800,,199,3.7142857142857144
8483217,5,B005QBBG1K,"What a wonderful movie!! It reminds me history, unfortunately, keeps repeating itself. Maybe we can learn from watching films like this. The acting was wonderful. I had a terrible time finding a copy of this film.",1454371200,,213,4.944444444444445
8483218,5,B005QBBG1K,"Wanted the one with Peter O'Toole but couldn't find it.  That version came out as a TV movie in the 80's.  Love Monty Woolley though, so should be a treat.",1404604800,,155,4.133333333333334
8483219,5,B005QBBG1K,"Very pleased, bought previous from a different supplier and it was a very poor copy.  This one is exactly what my father was looking for.  Will use again.",1402876800,,154,4.464285714285714
8483220,4,B005QBBG1K,"Monty Wooley was far from the book protagonist, but this is not a criticism. Book was of course more intense, the journey far more difficult but all in all a fair version, if not a great one.",1399852800,,191,4.1891891891891895
8483221,5,B005QBBG1K,"Delivery was a bit slow but worth the wait. Monty Wooley was a brilliant character actor. This is the story of a gruff English gentleman tourist who risks his life to smuggle Jewish children out of Nazi-occupied France. He eventually runs into a German General portrayed by famed director Otto Preminger (""Night of the Hunter"") who makes an unexpected request.",1391472000,,360,5.016666666666667
8483222,5,B005QBBG1K,I love this movie. It's a wonderful story of an older gentlemen trying to get children out of Europe and back to England at the start of World War II. Thankyou for finally making this available.,1388880000,,194,4.416666666666667
8483223,5,B005QBBG1K,"The Pied Piper (1942) with Monty Woolley, Roddy McDowell, Anne Baxter, and Otto Preminger is an exceptional WWII movie that the whole family can enjoy.  It tells the story of an elderly man that takes a fishing trip to try and  relive some of the good times with his son that has been killed.  While in a small village in France, the Germans invade.  He is asked to take two children back to England for safety.  As they make their way by any means of transportation they can, the two becomes several children.  One of my all time favorites.  I enjoyed it so much on TV that I bought mine overseas to get this on DVD-R from a British library.  To my knowledge no studio has purchased the rights and put it out on commercial DVD to date.  I hope they do because it is a great movie and I think one of Monty Wooley's best.

8483224,4,B005QBBG1K,"The film itself is excellent.  However, I was not aware when I ordered it that it's a DVR rather than a commercially processed DVD.  The packaging is Spartan, and there are no extras on the disc.  However, the picture quality, while not professionally remastered to be a crisp image with excellent contrasts, is certainly much better than many from sources such as this.  If you want this film for your collection, this is the only option at the moment, and you could do a lot worse.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1383350400,2,522,4.630434782608695
