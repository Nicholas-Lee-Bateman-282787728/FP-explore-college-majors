A great show!  If you liked the original, you should enjoy this. Was a big hit with the neighborhood kids.  Adults like it too.",1467676800,,192,4.757575757575758
8739730,5,B017M7USM8,"An Australian verson of the old Gerry Anderson series, this series delivers, new versions of the craft, the cast, but still some old favorate voice talent. Then there is the base itself, shades of the live action picture a few years back, but each launch bay has incredible detail, and simply fantastic equipment. I recommend this series to all. Be aware, this series comes on a Region 2 disc. It will only play on a multi-region DVD player . They are available through Amazon and not that expensive either.( mine ran under $100.)",1463443200,3,530,4.709677419354839
