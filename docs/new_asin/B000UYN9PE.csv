2927158,5,B000UYN9PE,Product arrived on time in stated condition at a good price.  Use these people.  What more is there to say?,1230076800,,107,4.3
2927159,2,B000UYN9PE,"I'll disagree with J. Fuzz.  I say this is a badly acted B-rated movie.  It is something I would have expected to see on T.V. 20 years ago.  Don't waste your time with this one.  The special effects are ok, but that is it.  The sad part is that this could have been such a good movie had it been done correctly.  By the way, hate to ruin anything, but the aliens look human of course.  It could have been pulled off with better acting.",1228694400,8,435,4.047058823529412
2927160,1,B000UYN9PE,"This was worst made film made by filmmakers who had the benefit of seeing other films and reading Sci-Fi material. If this film had been made 40 years ago, it would be worthy of praise. In the light of what we know about making Sci-fi movies and actors and filmmakers and people with money and time who have been to the movies , it was a waste of time making it and of those who watched it. This is not good Sci-fi. Everything was bad, the way people talked , died ,ran, hurryed along, drove, acted. The screenwriter was deaf and blind to how people talk and act. The special effects and CGI showed they had time and money.",1216166400,4,623,4.243697478991597
2927161,5,B000UYN9PE,This was a great SiFI movie. I would recommend it to all lovers of great SiFi movies.,1205107200,10,85,4.0588235294117645
2927162,4,B000UYN9PE,"This is a pretty good, low-budget Sci-Fi movie.  It wasn't your typical ""battle the creature,"" or ""fight the evil virus"" Sci-Fi movie.  It was a movie with a compelling premise - what would happen if the Earth had to surrender millions of people in order to save the entire planet?  It tells it from the point of view of several camps: a father who's daughter is selected, a resistance group, and the aliens themselves.  The acting is good, the visual effects are first rate, and the director keeps the pace and tension moving at a brisk rate.  While clearly a low-budget movie, the film had heart.  I recommend it.",1199750400,27,615,4.5963302752293576

8215654,4,B000UYN9PE,This was a cute sci fi movie. It was nothing to write home about bu tit was entertaining. Brad Johnson was great in it.,1353801600,,119,4.0
8215655,1,B000UYN9PE,Wooden acting and a predictable plot make this a complete yawner. The basic premise that aliens for some reason must harvest humans has been done before and done better.,1334102400,,169,4.862068965517241
8215656,2,B000UYN9PE,"A group of idealists teamed up with soldiers and a father who loved his daughter to blow up your infernal device.""

Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie.

I dunno, I hope for more from my science fiction than this; the special effects are not good, contrary to some of the other reviewers; the plot weak, the science ridiculous, and even the insight into the human condition--what so much science fiction is really about--totally missing.  So, really, the only reason to watch it is if you are totally bored, for some of the action sequences.  But you can do better, much better.",1328400000,2,586,4.715686274509804
8215657,1,B000UYN9PE,"Aliens need the blood of 8 million humans in order for their species to survive a virus. Rather than just take donated blood, they must take and kill the whole person. Apparently blood from recently dead people doesn't work either. The race is advance enough to create wormholes, but not a virus vaccine. The acting is mediocre at best. It is a shame to see Carl Weathers, of Rocky fame, fall this far from grace. A small group of vigilantes decide to take on the US government and the alien race. They saved a lot of money by making the aliens look human. No nudity, bad language, or sexy stuff. The special effects in this movie haven't advanced since the early Star Trek days.",1280188800,3,679,4.483870967741935
8215658,2,B000UYN9PE,"Okay, there's this race, the Kulku.  Oh, they had a ship crash on Earth in the 1940s (remember Roswell NM?).  But this time, their race is suffering a fatal plague.  They must have been the ones abducting humans and performing all those probing experiments, because they knew that the cure to their plague was the bloody essence of 8 million humans.  Now, because they have this big space cannon thingy, all the governments of Earth decide to capitulate, and pick their assigned quota of citizens to send to be ""harvested.""  The US contribution is some 800,000 people, and we chose the democratic approach... a lottery enforced by the military.  But Dr. Chase's daughter is chosen, and he vows to rescue her.  And, who knows, maybe he will save humanity at the same time!

Oh... did I give anything away?  And...

- the Kulku sure look like human beings (except they never seem to smile).
- the chief Kulku blood harvester looks like one of those diabolic mad scientists, with a Germanesque accent.
- Dr. Chase went to a great university, because he must have taken ""fly an alien spaceship and land it on Earth without anyone needing to show him how to do it and land on the exact spot his friends are standing"" 101.  I missed this course in the catalog!
- this technologically advanced race of Kulku harvest the blood essence and, to deliver it to the sled that propels it through a wormhole back to their home planet, spray it through... shower nozzles (you will recognize them).  That, I am certain, is a critical step in the process!

I could go on, but it gives me a headache.  Very forgettable movie... I hope.",1267315200,3,1616,4.604895104895105
8215659,1,B000UYN9PE,"Alien Siege brings to the screen the unlikely scenario that a race of all too human-looking aliens will arrive in search of human blood to prevent their extinction.
Sometime in the not-so-distant future the Kulku aliens arrive in need of 8 million humans' blood to cure a deadly disease that is killing off their race. The United States has to provide 800,000 people, however, with 300,000 to go a scientist's daughter is among the chosen to be handed over to be turned into ""blood supplies."" The father, subsequently, embarks on a lame adventure to rescue his ""baby girl.""
The movie starts off interestingly enough and then it's downhill from then on. Don't look for the movie to pick up; it doesn't. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all way below average.
In a nutshell, Alien Siege is definitely not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment if intoxicated and/or in a silly mood.",1247788800,,987,4.777777777777778
8215660,3,B000UYN9PE,I saw this movie on SciFi.  It caught my eye and I ended up watching it through to the end.  It wasn't a truly horrible film but there were things that could have been done better.,1242432000,,180,3.9722222222222223
