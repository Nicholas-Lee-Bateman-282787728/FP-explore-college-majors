8749867,1,B01AZLJW6G,"This is not a professional-grade presentation. I was especially disappointed with the audio and video quality: It seems as if someone used a low-quality camcorder and passed it off as professional. It's VHS-quality, if not worse, on a DVD. Billy Crone's self-presentation is also disappointing. I couldn't even get through the first lesson without turning it off. His mannerisms were awkward, and he was insulting toward his opponents. It's all bad form, especially for a ""professional"" presentation.

If you really want to suffer through this, just download the material for free from Crone's church website. (Yes, you can get it legally for free! There's a good reason for that!)",1483315200,,681,5.247706422018348
