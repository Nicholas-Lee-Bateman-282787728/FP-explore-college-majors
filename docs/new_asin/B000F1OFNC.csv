8116383,4,B000F1OFNC,I haven't seen this segment w/Spider-Man and a vampire in years. Granted some of these individual discs from the 1994-1998 series - some are better than others. If I could afford it I would buy this especially after seeing Mutant Agenda. Ah - nostalgia.,1516147200,,253,4.7727272727272725
