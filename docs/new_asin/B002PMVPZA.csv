8377119,3,B002PMVPZA,"""Legend of the Hairy Beast"" follows two expeditions of Bigfoot researchers moving into Native reservations on the U.S. West Coast. One of the research teams turn out to include Bobo and Cliff Barackman, immortalized by a later TV show, ""Finding Bigfoot"".

Since ""Monsterquest"" is supposed to be scientific, Bobo and Cliff strike a serious pose, to the point of Bobo being called ""James Fay"", LOL.

This particular episode focuses on Native eye-witnesses, and points out that Bigfoot sightings were common long before the White settler arrived in North America. ""The hairy man"" was an integrated part of the Native worldview, and old rock art shows Bigfoot-like creatures together with recognized animals.

As usual, ""MonsterQuest"" is incredibly boring, but in contrast to most other episodes, one of the research groups almost come up with something - unsurprisingly, it's the BFRO team headed by Barackman and Jim Fay. Unfortunately, their glimpses of the Hairy Man go unrecorded by the camera...

But, as I said before, it's pretty obvious that *something* really strange is going on at the West Coast - and it sure aint the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker!",1353801600,,1151,5.205405405405405
