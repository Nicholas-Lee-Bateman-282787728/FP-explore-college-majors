Over the past few years, Mill Creek has also taken to reshuffling its public domain film lineup into new themes. In this case, it appears that Mill Creek simply changed the cover art from its 2012 release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-s-Leading-Men/dp/B008L0YN72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood's Leading Men</a>, which is available at an even lower price than this version. The movies are the same, so you might prefer that earlier version if it's still cheaper by the time you read this.",1412640000,27,650,6.314606741573034

5978553,1,B00FDZ7W08,"I bought this based on the good reviews. Ugh. These are truly bad movies. These are like the old movies you watched on a Saturday afternoon before there was cable and more than 3 channels. Chances are, you didn't watch them back then either because your next door neighbor would come over and ask you to go outside and play.

I was working on a hobby and wanted some noise. I thought I'd play one of these DVDs in the multi disk set. Two movies I fast forwarded, that's how bad they were. Two others I let run but they were so badly acted by just their dialogue, I never had to look up.

A movie on David & Goliath is now playing and the horrible spooky music made me want to 1) ask for a refund and 2) warn you NOT to buy this.

Only buy this if you think it'll increase your chances of having your neighbor pop in to ask you to go outside and play.",1471392000,10,850,4.017751479289941

5978566,3,B00FDZ7W08,"I have several of Mill Creeks boxed sets and they seem to have gone cheap on this one. Their other sets had the DVDs in individual card-stock envelopes and they used double-sided DVDs. This set has neither.
I can live without the individual envelopes, but placing five films on one-side of a DVD really requires a low resolution. I don't expect Blu-ray clarity on these old films but the previous Mill Creek sets only placed two movies per side on the double-sided discs. I have only checked six or seven of the films and the poorest quality so far, The Night America Trembled is almost un-watchable because of the low resolution. Some of the other titles are acceptable for what they are.
For the money, 20-films for $5 is a bargain. If the discs are too bad, they can always be repurposed as drink coasters on the coffee table or as mini-Frisbees for your pets to chase.",1447372800,19,872,4.560509554140127

THIS GIFT IS THE BOMB!  get the popcorn.  PASS CHRISTMAS I JUST SENT IT TO SOME PEOPLE WHO I KNOW ARE ON THE SAME MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL FOOTING WITH ME AND THEY LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  THEY ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR AGEING PARENTS AND GRAND-PARENTS TO COME AND STAY WITH THEM FOR 6 MONTHS EVERY YEAR.

The rest have very poor sound quality and very poor picture quality, and many are from the 1970's...and the color was really horrible and grainy.
