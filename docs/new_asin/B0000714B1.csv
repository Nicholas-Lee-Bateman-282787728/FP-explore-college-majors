7973480,1,B0000714B1,I ordered this and another DVD  for my grandmother for Christmas as she was in declining health and I wanted something peaceful for her. what I received was some sort of soft core porn! Some person or thing at the sorting center probably thought this was funny. Nice job guys. Way to rack up that karma. Shame one you for what you did.,1358035200,,335,4.317460317460317
7973481,5,B0000714B1,"This gorgeous cinematic and musical presentation of part of our national park heritage is a must see for everyone who appreciates natural wonders. It obviously has the influence of an artist's eye, but just as obviously stems from a deep experience of those wonders. Similar high quality dvds I can't get enough of: ""Timeless, A National Parks Odyssey,"" with music by Patick O'Hearn; ""Earth Scapes,"" a beautiful award winning dvd with cinematography by David Fortney; the stunning dvd ""Star Gaze, Hubble's View of the Universe;"" and ""Real Sanctuary,"" a relaxing and captivating undersea experience with music by Hilary Stagg.",1071619200,4,625,5.3232323232323235
