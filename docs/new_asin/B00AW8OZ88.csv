5510630,4,B00AW8OZ88,"This review does contain spoilers!

I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this film to review.  Day of the Falcon is a ""well-oiled machine"" that moves along fairly fast given the 130 minute run time.  Within this movie, you can expect to see some romance, action, betrayal, and violence.  This movie pretty much gives you all the drama you crave and can handle.

Day of the Falcon takes place in the early 20th Century in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, which are divided by feuding tribes and where there is basically no loyalty.  It starts out with a meeting between two tribe leaders, Emir Nesib (Antonio Banderas) and Sultan Amar (Mark Strong) making peace after a battle between the two, which Nesib won.  Nesib has Sultan hand over his two sons, Auda and Saleh, to make sure he will not battle against him again and they both promised the area of that land would not be claimed by either tribe.

The film then progresses in time and an American named, Thurkettle, shows up on an airplane.  Thurkettle works for Texan Oil and he meets with Nesib to tell him there could be a lot of oil on the unclaimed land and this could make him rich.  Nesib thinks about it and let's them drill and, sure enough, they find oil on the land.  After finding oil, they make an oil field in that area and Nesib gets rich.  Sultan objects to this because Nesib is basically breaking the truce they made at the beginning of the film.  As Nesib is getting rich, he starts to improve his tribe, or kingdom, by making schools, a library, and even bringing electricity to the area.  Prince Auda, who was raised by Nesib and not his real father, was forced to marry Nesib's daughter, Princess Leyla (Freida Pinto).

Within the battle scenes, or when the action begins to pick up over an hour into the film, you will see many dead camels and dead people as well.  These battle scenes are pretty well done and keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time.  There is, however, a bit of a disappointment with the final battle scene because it wasn't as ""grand"" as one would expect.  I was expecting a longer battle scene, but this one seemed to be a little too short and quick.  In my opinion, it could have been better as this was, for me, the climax of the whole movie.

Overall, Day of the Falcon was an enjoyable movie.  Like I stated before, it seemed to move along pretty fast given the runtime, in fact, that last battle scene may have been a bit too fast, but given the battle scenes throughout, it is one small aspect one can look over.  There was even a bit of comedy in this movie as well where Nesib makes improvements to his kingdom, although I don't believe this movie was intended to be a comedy.  If you appreciate a movie with drama, romance, and violence, then this movie is for you and must be watched.  I would recommend this movie for anybody's movie collection.  Overall, this movie isn't perfect, but I still give it a 4/5 star rating.

Day of the Falcon will be available to purchase in stores on DVD and Blu-ray March 26th, 2013!

Overall rating:  4/5 stars",1363910400,18,3074,4.42170818505338
5510631,4,B00AW8OZ88,"DAY OF THE FALCON is an old-fashioned action/adventure epic that evokes memories of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.

Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the film is set in the Middle East during the early part of the twentieth century when oil is discovered in a ""no man's land"" that divides two warring tribes.  The forward-thinking ruler of one tribe (Antonio Banderas) embraces the finding, realizing that the accompanying wealth can help his people, while the other sultan (Mark Strong) despises any influence from the outside, modern world, claiming that such amenities are against the Koran.  War is re-ignited, and the principal player in the conflict turns out to be the studious son of Strong (Tahar Rahim), who is now also the son-in-law of Banderas, having married his daughter, played by Freida Pinto.

DAY OF THE FALCON is a handsome, well-directed picture, filled with exciting action sequences and beautifully photographed desert vistas.  The story is certainly involving, and the actors are more than equal to their roles.  It is a movie well worth seeing.

Question: If this picture is so good, why did it not get any sort of meaningful release in the United States where it virtually went direct-to-video?

Possibly for two reasons:

First, the producers, in an effort not to offend anybody, took a middle-of-the-road approach to the material.  Are we, as an audience, supposed to be cheering for Bandaras, who wants to bring his people into the modern world, or should our sympathies lie with the more traditional Strong?  Even when Rahim starts leading his father's military, we are not sure as to where his true loyalties lie.

Secondly, although I understand the producer's reasons for wanting to cast Arab actors, I think that, in order to attract a worldwide audience, this is a movie that required internationally known stars.

Don't misunderstand.  The actors in the picture are all very good, but with the exception of Bandaras, none of them are really that well-known, and none of them generate an on-screen excitement that a high budget film like this requires in order to pull in audiences.

True, when they made LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif were also unknown quantities, but the producers of that classic surrounded them with a sensational cast of supporting players that included Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle, Jose Ferrer and Arthur Kennedy.

DAY OF THE FALCON could have used some of that star quality.

The DVD from Image Entertainment includes three excellent ""making of"" featurettes, one of which describes how the cast and crew fared shooting in Tunisia while a government coup was in progress.

5510632,4,B00AW8OZ88,"Imagine my surprise when this past weekend, out of the blue, this movie appeared (on  a single screen) in the theatre here in Cincinnati, almost a year and a half after it was first released in Europe. I figured this would not be playing very long, and went ahead and saw it.

""Day of the Falcon"" (2011 release from France/Qatar; 130 min.) is also known as ""Black Gold"" in certain markets. The epic desert-and-oil story is set in the 1930s in a fictional Middle East area where two tribes are dealing differently with the unexpected windfalls of crude oil discoveries. As the movie opens, we see how, in order to preserve peace, the Amar tribe leader sends off his two young sons to live with the rival Nesib tribe leader, with an additional agreed ""no-man's land"" area called the Yellow Belt between the two tribes. Skip 15 years forward and we now see the sons are grown men, and a Texas oil company strikes it big in the Yellow Belt and approaches the two rivaling tribes. The Nesib tribe decides to work with Big Oil while the Amar tribe rejects it out of ideological/religious considerations. Will the two tribes fight it out? Will the two sons eventually return to their original tribe? To tell you much more of this plot-heavy movie would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, the main reason I was interested in seeing the movie is because of its director Jean-Jacques Annaud, veteran of a number of great movies (none more so than ""Quest of Fire"" from the 1980s). Second, this movie is a French-Qatar co-production, with most of the financing from the Doha Film Institute. Why is this releveant? A number of elements in the movie feel more ""Arabian"" than French (such as: complete modesty in showing women and when filming love scenes). Third, the feel of this movie is one of 'big production' all the way, with elaborate staging throughout, including a number of the desert fighting scenes which are quite impressive. The producers also enlisted a big name, James Horner, for the soundtrack (which is quite lovely). Last but, alas, not least: while the movie oozes ambition from start to finish, it falls short in character development and I rarely felt emotionally invested while watching this. Given Annaud's footprint, this came as a surprise and disappointment to me. Incidentaly, the screening where I saw this movie here in Cincinnati this past weekend was very poorly attended (only one other person besides myself) so I am quite sure this will not stick around long. Bottom line: while this is not a bad movie per se, ultimately the movie's grand ambitions are not realized and the end result is simply uneven.",1362355200,25,2718,4.778723404255319
5510633,4,B00AW8OZ88,"This is the story of how the Arab tribes became united by war, to become Saudi Arabia. Antonio Banderas stars as Emir Nesib who bartered a deal with the United States for the oil. He was able to buy off most of the other tribes except for one, who believed the infidels of the west should leave their land.

While the movie is fictional, it reflects the conflict that goes on within the world of Islam today. Antonio Banderas, with his Spanish accent was as convincing as an Arab as Sean Connery with his Scottish accent was as convincing as a Russian submarine captain.  In other words, he pulls it off.

The characters are western stereotypes of Arab culture. They are played well, if you are into the stereotype.

Antonio Banderas is lovely as a desert sheik who dreams of bringing prosperity to his resource poor nation at the turn of the 20th century. The creativity and luxury of this film make it impossible to resist. It is long, but it is well worth the endeavor of watching. The cast and brilliant script make this movie more reminiscent of a Warner Brothers/Hal Wallis production than anything more modern. (Yes, I realize that the Warners, now, wouldn't be likely producers of a pro Saudi film, but if you doubt the international respect that the Warners had for all people of the World then watch Boggart in ""Sahara""). It's a film of great vision and scope. If you saw it in black and white you'd assume it was a Warmers or MGM production with Hal Wallis producing and O. Selznick borrowed from MGM to direct with the Epstein brothers responsible for making the book into a script. If you don't know anything about Saudi Arabia, this movie is a good introduction.

The story line is portrays two, Islamic, Arab leader, who clash over their interpretation the Koran.  Both want what is best for their people, however one tenaciously, inflexibly adheres to rigid ultra conservative interpretation  while the other seeks a more liberal interpretation that will allow drilling for oil so as to bring wealth and a better quality of life for his people.  It is a sensitively sculpted movie that thoughfully exposes the conflicts of  old  vs modern;  literal vs interpretive,  women's value & rights;  young vs old, father vs son;  father;  nomadic existence vs a city based society; and a great number of other yin & yang coupled  topics that provoke thoughtful reflection of the morals & messages this movie conveys and it's relevance and applicability to the  Arab & Islamic world today.

5510658,3,B00AW8OZ88,"There's undoubtedly a good film to be made out of the scramble for oil in the Arabian desert in the 1930s, and how medieval desert kingdoms were suddenly rushed into the 20th century (this subject was in part dealt in Tintin's Land of Black Gold) but this is not quite it. We have two warring sultans, played by Antonio Banderas and Mark Strong. As the movie starts, they have decided to make peace, creating a neutral zone in their frontier, but not before Banderas takes Strong's two sons as hostages. The truce holds up for several years (allowing Strong's children to became adults), until an American geologist arrives in a small airplane claiming the buffer zone has a lot of oil beneath it. So the war begins again

This tries to be an adventure film in the classic tradition. It starts excitingly, but it grows more boring with time. Filming it in English and with non Arabian actors as leads doesn't help the movie in credibility. The decent budget and nice cinematography helps in recreating Arabia in the early 20th century (it was filmed mostly in Tunisia). This was directed by French filmmaker Jean Jacques Annaud (Quest for Fire, The Bear, Seven Years in Tibet). Based on a 1957 novel by Hans Ruesch, a Swiss writer, who also wrote the Eskimo adventure Top of the World (upon which a film starring Anthony Quinn was made in 1960).

Surviving the trek through the impossibly hostile desert, defeating armored cars and airplanes and their machine guns, discovering offshore fresh water springs along the Arabian coast just before dying of thirst, and other ""deus ex machina"" situations really test your ability to suspend belief.  However, you do get introduced to some multi-faceted characters and their complicated relationships with each other.  I especially liked how Antonio Banderas acted out his role.  At the risk of oversimplifying this film, I'd have to classify it as a complex modern old-time Hollywood western set in the Middle East.  Watch it, you'll like it.",1400112000,,723,5.4774774774774775

To my surprise...there was a lot of cultural content and a very compelling story line.  The acting was solid.  It takes place in a very interesting time period...when foreigners were coming into the Middle East to drill for oil.

The movie does a very good job of illustrating the cultural issues and, for once, is on the side of the tribes.

I like the plot of the movie, and I believe it's very close to the reality of oil discovery in UAE and Saudi Arabia, and how that dramatically changed that region ever since.

Finally, I also find it accurate when it comes to quoting Qura'an and Islamic teachings. I believe they did a really good job studying both the culture and the religion.",1398470400,,580,4.621359223300971

But subtly it also reveals the brutal side of the desert: poverty, disease and never ending tribal warfare.

5510748,2,B00AW8OZ88,"Story could have been interesting, but it just never clicked for me. It had some solid actors/actresses, great cinematography, but I never got pulled into the story on any level. Some actors and actresses fill the screen and make a film worth watching (Bogie, Bacall, Page, Eastwood). Some films have a story or theme that hits the right buttons (good wins over evil, underdog finally gets a break and takes it, etc.). Some action is just so decent, esp. if woven into enough story to make it appropriate, that the action pulls a movie through (Bourne Identity-films, etc.). Some follow the tv serial model - a few very likable (or hate-worthy) characters, several ongoing plots that thread through each episode (danger, love interest, a little friendly bickering, like Star Trek, Cheers, and others, also some films  hey, speaking of Banderas, why not ""The 13th Warrior""?).

I can never quite put my finger on it, or at least figure out how to say it right, but some films get close, could have made it. Something is missing. Maybe too many big actors who need their 20 minutes of focus, though it does not help the overall script (Syriana, but then contrast that to Ocean's Eleven, also probably Ocean's Twelve, which did it with aplomb....). No single character pulled it out, the story did not evoke enough emotion (good guy wins, bad guy loses, history is explained and the real truths are somewhat better uncovered, etc.).",1388275200,,1428,4.848360655737705

Having no special effects was in itself a special effect. True acting by all. It is a relief not to see a movie about the Middle East that was filmed in Arizona or Nevada.

5510750,4,B00AW8OZ88,"I am came across this film strictly by accident and I am so glad I did.  I am an American born, female, Christian Arab.  I was intrigued by this mainly because Antonio Banderas was acting as an Arab.  I had no idea what the storyline was.  I was strictly interested in seeing how he would handle this role.  He and Mark Strong did a fabulous job capturing the heart of the Arabian male mind and the heart.  While there is some character development that needed more work (ex. Ali and the resentment toward his father Amar), it was really an epic achievement.  The majesty and grandeur of the filming, the authenticity of the lifestyle, the costumes, music, everything was top notch.  Why did I never even HEAR about this movie???

The first time I watched this movie, I sobbed, almost uncontrollably, with a deep pain inside of me because I know what the Arabic mind is like.  We are a very proud and very stubborn people and, unfortunately, it often (too often) takes talking with a sword to get your point across or defend your stance - even if you're wrong, you can never admit it.  Oftentimes, it is petty things that spiral out of control and become the ""mountains out of molehills"", and this film captured that mindset perfectly.  Actually, it showed it in a more civil light, but the main gist was captured, and except for the pointless death of Ali, I am in love with it and just bought it for myself.

I would rate this a 4.7, but since we can only choose even stars, I had to go with a 4 - it's Ali's death that did that (he was too cute, witty, and handsome to die!) :-D.",1387670400,6,1582,4.3583617747440275

Don't do that because you will be missing out on a fantastic movie. I thought this was going to be a Romeo and Juliet type story. It wasn't, not by a long shot. It is the first movie that I have seen that actually showed Muslims/Arabs in a positive light (Rambo 3 doesn't count) while acknowledging the Qu'ran and offering characters of reasonable depth.

The quality of acting, which is multi-cultural, is outstanding, the desert quite beautiful, the Arabic dress wonderful, the staging - all of it.  This was my introduction to Tahar Rahim,and along with Antonio Banderas, Freida Pinto, Marco Salussolia (aka Mark Strong), Riz Ahmed, Akim Gazi, Liya Kebede, and of course Eriq Ebouaney and Lotfi Dziri, the cast was perfectly selected.  I am very glad as well that Producer Tarak Ben Ammar selected French Director Jean-Jacques Annaud as the approach is very respectful of the culture, a quality that might have been lost had an American director been selected.  This aspect was emphasized in the ""Making of"" documentary special feature that accompanies the film. And the general tenor is a little more low key than American movies whose violence and impact tends to be over the top. We don't need to be slammed in the face to enjoy a good film.  The overall view of the culture and words of wisdom:  ""Anything that can be bought has no real value"" - a lesson for our culture as well.",1368144000,,1102,4.773684210526316
5510791,3,B00AW8OZ88,"While most of us are quite aware of the fact that the main source of oil these days comes from the Middle East most of us have no idea how it came to be discovered there or what brought about a change that allowed the oil to flow to the rest of the world. Many of the answers to these questions can be found in the new DVD release DAY OF THE FALCON.

The film opens with two warring leaders coming to terms with their boundaries. Sultan Amar (Mark Strong) is the more traditional of the two, following the guidelines of his religion as much as possible. Emir Nesib (Antonio Banderas) is a more forward thinking ruler wishing more for his people. The two agree to keep the Yellow Belt, the land between their two countries, as neutral territories. To seal the deal Amar's sons will go with Nesib and be raised as his own to insure the peace.

Fifteen years pass and the peace holds until the day a Texas oil company official approaches Nesib. He tells him there is oil in the Yellow Belt. Nesib has always thought of himself as a ruler who has nothing and no way to provide for his people in a desert covered land. He sees this as an opportunity to grow incredible wealth and in return advance his people by building schools, hospitals and more. The only problem is that in mining these oil fields he has broken the peace agreement and the possibility of war opens once again.

When one of the two princes held as hostage for the peace is killed, his brother Prince Auda (Tahar Rahim) sets out to set things straight. What follows is his adventure in both worlds as he tries to find a compromise that will settle old scores, revenge the deaths in his family and create a world that will have both peace and prosperity.

The beginning of the film sets the stage for what follows so if you find it a bit tedious give it some time. Once Auda heads out to fulfill his destiny things begin to pick up and the action flows with the story rather than the story around it. The role of Nesib seems like a beneficent father figure for his people but of course too much power seems to lead to corruption and poor decision making.  The clash of cultures attempts to explain how things have turned out and in some ways does so, in others not so much.

The end result is an entertaining and informative film. In looking deeper you may find that the story has been tweaked a bit here and there to make it more film worth, but the gist of the story remains. While not quite LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the film is worth watching.",1365897600,5,2504,4.317021276595745

Not one I would watch again or suggest to a friend to watch.",1365811200,,375,3.883116883116883
5510793,4,B00AW8OZ88,"This is the story of how the Arab tribes became united by war, to become Saudi Arabia. Antonio Banderas stars as Emir Nesib who bartered a deal with the United States for the oil. He was able to buy off most of the other tribes except for one, who believed the infidels of the west should leave their land.

While the movie is fictional, it reflects the conflict that goes on within the world of Islam today. Antonio Banderas, with his Spanish accent was as convincing as an Arab as Sean Connery with his Scottish accent was as convincing as a Russian submarine captain. In other words, he pulls it off.

The characters are western stereotypes of Arab culture. They are played well, if you are into the stereotype.

What was with the harem outfit on Frieda Pinto?

8558192,4,B00AW8OZ88,"This is an entertaining overly-long fictional account of the origin of the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia in the early twentieth century and the impact it made on two tribes. The film includes a typical often redone love story between the male and female of the two warring tribes. In the tale, two large tribes, there were many smaller ones, bordered one another and engaged in war between them. When one clearly lost, an agreement was made that the wining tribe would take the two legitimate sons of the loser and hold them as hostage, and the land between the two tribes would be no-man's land. Later, oil is found on the no-man's land and the victorious tribe decides to allow Texans to get the oil in violation of the agreement between the tribes. The head of the losing tribe was not interested in money, but the maintenance of tradition. This resulted in many deaths and many battles between the two tribes.",1522022400,2,916,4.625766871165644
8558193,5,B00AW8OZ88,"This was a very enjoyable movie - on many different levels.  No ""Bad"" language - it was totally unnecessary due to the skillful script which was
almost equal to the the action and scenery expanse that developed the whole plot. If you listen carefully you can learn in a broad scale sense how Islam and the Western oil interests exploited and made the Mid East (region)  the type and nature of culture that exist in their part of the world. The movie had a generous amount of emphasis on family and personal integrity values not found in very many films coming out of Hollywood these days.
To sum things up - it's rare to find a movie worthy of a 5*** rating on a many points as this one - not the least of which was the excellent set of actors and how whole masterpiece came together.

8558198,1,B00AW8OZ88,"In the Day of the Falcon, Auda is a young very humble Saudi man who leads his people to unify and seek harmony with the West.  As an epic film I would give Day of the Falcon a strong A.  However, the reality of Saudi Arabia is very different than the film portrays.  Osama Bin Laden is more like the real face of Saudi Arabia.  Most of the hijackers at 911 were from Saudi Arabia and there is strong evidence that the King of Saudi Arabia financed 911.  There are no Christian churches allowed in Saudi Arabia, yet they have financed almost a 1000 mosques in Europe and another 1000 mosques in America.  Many of these mosques have Imims that are teaching Sharia Law to overthrow our Constitution, thus treason.  The movie shows Auda freeing the slaves.  But in reality Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries left in the world that still practices slavery.  Auda kept on stating that the Quran teaches peace, not war.  But this is totally false.  There are over 100 verses in the Quran that demand that Moslems conquer non Moslems, and the Saudis went out and conquered over 50 Christian Countries of people that never meant them any harm.  They committed genocide and killed all the men and then took the wives home and raped them and turned them into sex slaves.  In the movie, when King Amar said the Texans only wanted to talk about money, this was a great fallacy.  If they had said that they were Southern Baptists and Jesus is the way, truth and the life, King Amar would have had them beheaded.  And another fallacy is when King Amar said that nothing of value can come from money.  What about paying for a wedding?  Or paying a doctor to deliver a baby?  Or paying for the necessities of life, like food, clothing and shelter?  He said that anything of value is obtained from blood and love.  Okay, let's go out and kill some infidels and steal their goods!  Is this supposed to be wisdom and spiritual?  In faith and 1380 years of practice, Islam is a death cult, which began in Saudi Arabia.",1489622400,2,2003,4.4301369863013695
