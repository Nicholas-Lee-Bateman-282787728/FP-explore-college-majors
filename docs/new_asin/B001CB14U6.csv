The lessons are easy-to-follow, informative and the tips contained in them are invaluable. She has truly taken the difficulty and confusion out of dog training and has produced an excellent training resource within this video!",1215993600,5,371,5.0
8286344,5,B001CB14U6,"I watched the CD with my children who happen to be begging for a puppy.  Although the CD is for training dogs, it is a great eye opener for kids who want a dog. What a great way to show kids that puppies and dogs are a big responsibility.  My kids loved watching all the training routines.  Loved it!  When we do get our puppy we will watching this many many times.  Great training information....from beginning to the end.",1377043200,2,423,4.30379746835443

8286347,5,B001CB14U6,"Our old dog, Hannah was pretty good mannered until we brought home a new 2 1/2 year old dog from a rescue center. This addition to our family only annoyed Hannah and created many dog fights.  It was time to retrain and put both of these dogs on the same page.  Our dogs needed a refresher course and so did we.  The Teach That Dog video helped our family review some basics and work with our dogs.  The video is simple to follow, basic and just what we needed. We used it as a refresher, but I would definitely recommend it as well to the family that has never done any dog training and wanted to learn the basics so they have a well behaved dog.  I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase this video as a guideline for some basic training.",1321228800,4,753,4.165517241379311
8286348,1,B001CB14U6,"This has to be the worst dog training video ever produced. Not only does this woman resort to stupidity to annoy us, (pretending to pull her hair out, some random guy walking on camera to pick the dog up to move & it lots more)the cd may be 101 minutes long but most of that is on ridiculous crap. There is less than 15 minutes devoted to training a dog, but NOT on HOW to train one. While her dog who is named... Yes Super Dooper seems well trained he is used to show us what they'll do AFTER they are trained and not how to be effective at training. In fact the first one who wants it can have my copy. I'll send it to you and trust you to send me the postage once you receive it. Don't waste your money on this idiotic bull.",1305504000,2,727,3.9523809523809526
8286349,5,B001CB14U6,"A must have for all dog owners!  It was a easy to watch, informative and funny video with tons of useful information on training your dog and yourself.",1302825600,,151,4.392857142857143
8286350,5,B001CB14U6,"I got this video just yesterday, I watched it and worked with my 10 wk old mastiff puppy using the video's pointers on the sit command and getting my pup's attention.  It worked great.  The instructor is very relaxed and upbeat.  The pointers given are easily understood and can be put into practice immediately. My 10 yo is watching with me and is picking up on the training tips as well.

There is some breed information on a couple of breeds in the video too. Looking forward to getting through the whole video with our pup and having a well behaved dog.",1297728000,,557,4.431372549019608
8286351,5,B001CB14U6,"My husband and I allowed our nine year old son to choose a Boykin Spaniel from a litter that our friends had (they raise Boykins). We have an English Springer Spaniel who is 13 and pretty much sleeps all day and our son wanted a dog to play fetch with....Our puppy is 10 weeks old and a handful (as are all puppies). Gunner, was the pick of the litter-best looking, very confident, smart...but with that also comes some strong willed behavior. This is where Pat comes in.  We will have the privilege of taking private lessons with Pat (as she lives 10 minutes away from us!!) but in the meantime we want to get a jump start on training our puppy so I orderd the DVD. I received the DVD within a week-in perfect condition. I watched the DVD and was thrilled with my purchase.  Pat gives detailed and careful instructions on how to teach your dog to sit, stay, walk on a leash....all the things a responsible dog owner would want. Since we all learn in different ways, the instructions are visual AND written . It's obvious that Pat loves dogs and enjoys helping people achieve that speical bond between man and dog.  This DVD is an excellent tool for those who want to have a well mannered and happy dog.
Thanks Pat!",1266624000,4,1215,4.415178571428571
8286352,5,B001CB14U6,"Pat is such a wonderful trainer.  She is extremely patient and great with animals.  Although I am not able to travel to her classes, the Super Dooper Dog Training Video is perfect for my family and Trooper (rat terrier mix).  We are able to learn all of the necessary ways to approach our dog to have effective and positive communication without actually being at a dog training class.  Also, the video is quite cute and humorous, and engages the viewer, making it easy to be proactive with our pet.  Thanks for such a great DVD.",1216339200,6,529,4.526315789473684
8286353,5,B001CB14U6,"Our family has two amazing dogs, but they weren't alway ""perfect"" dogs! One is a Chessi named Brandi and the other a springer spaniel/australian shepherd mix named Bella.

Brandi is a purebred who has always been an easy going dog who listens well, but it took a lot of time & patience when it came to teaching her manners.  Just a few short years later, she picked up some unwanted
behaviors from a puppy we took care of for a few months!  I was at a loss for words... what happened to my perfect dog?

This past November, our family grew with the addition of our newest member, Bella.  After our second checkup with our vet, he suspected that our new puppy may have some Pit Bull mixed in. That was a big concern for my husband, so the vet recommended putting her through the Canine Good Citizen program to ease our concerns and that's when we met Pat.

Attending Pat's classes was incredible!  Pat helped me ""fix"" the commands I was using.and I could not believe how fast Bella picked up on these commands!  Because of my busy schedule, I purchased this dvd to help with Bella's training and I can't say enough about how helpful it is!!! With the Super Dooper Tips that appear throughout the lessons, I've built confidence in my commands & have become the leader of the pack.  We now fully enjoy the love, loyalty, and companionship we have with our dogs. There are no problems from either one of them. We just get to have fun with the dogs all the time.

This DVD is so easy to follow and fun! It is unique in that it goes beyond teaching basic manners such as sit, down, and stay - it walks you through the hows and whys of the most common problems that dog owners encounter - with clear demonstrations and explanations that everyone in the family can understand. Her techniques produces results within the first couple of sessions!!! I highly recommend ""Teach That Dog"" to everyone!!!",1216080000,8,1890,4.48396501457726
