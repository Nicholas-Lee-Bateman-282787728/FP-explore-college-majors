If you can get by the 80's opening, you are in for a poorly acted hard to follow film. Korda is an engineer working on an automobile that runs off an energy cell. It will revolutionize how we travel. Needless to say everyone wants it for one reason or another and all the women want his sorry moody butt. There is also a gang of youths displaced by the factory which destroys cars. Hence the original title ""Killing Cars.""

The film isn't worth viewing, even for crime, drama, Senta Berger fans.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, full frontal nudity.",1360713600,,659,4.672413793103448

For a cheesey 1970's movie it's OK.  AND HAVING TO WRITE 20 F..N WORDS ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS WAY TOOOOOO LONG",1315440000,,173,4.242424242424242
