8294547,4,B001DQPXT8,This is a good production video.  I have many videos from Sharilyn Miller.  She is a great teacher.  Quality video.  Somewhat basic ring designs.  Good for the beginner to intermediate wire wrapper.,1398211200,,198,5.0625
8294548,5,B001DQPXT8,Excellent DVD with very cool designs.  I love all of Sharilyn Millers books/dvd's and recommend them for anybody interested in making wire jewelry (good for all skill levels).,1316649600,,175,5.25
8294549,5,B001DQPXT8,"I ordered this video not necessarily just because of the 7 other rave reviews, (that helped) but rather because I saw a portion of the DVD on Sharilyn Miller's website [...].  I was pretty confident that the DVD was just as informative and as clear as the clip on her website, and it is.  I am very, very pleased with this DVD because it guides you through the process of making 5 types of rings with ease as if you are in the actual workshop with her.  The DVD is comprised of 15 chapters covering:

*Tools and Materials
*Reaming Beads and Pearls
*Big Twist Rings
*Tibetan Rings
*Wrap Around Bead Rings
*A Bead on a Wire Ring
*Overhand Knot Rings

There are additional resources that include the websites of suppliers of tools, wire, and recommended reading (only 1 of the 5 books was a Sharilyn Miller book).  Let me just add that I mentioned that only 1 of the recommended books is hers because I detest so called instructional DVD's that are a platform for selling all of the instructor's wares, which I don't believe to be very ""honest"" instruction. The student should be made aware of various options for material needs and other recommendations to help improve the student's abilities.

I was concerned about the quality of the DVD before I made this purchase, but I have to say that this DVD is very professionally produced; the lighting was perfect, the sound quality was great, and the only things that are ever shown in the DVD are Sharilyn Miller's hands and the materials and tools she's working with. Included in the DVD is the method she uses to artificially age rings, as well as how to resize rings, and even how to finish or polish rings. She instructs at a pace that is very easy for students to follow.  She's detailed enough with each step that you really shouldn't have any questions after viewing the entire DVD.  I finished the DVD feeling thoroughly satisfied and inspired enough to not only construct these beautiful rings, but to add my own creative touches.

I don't think anyone with a desire to learn to make rings, as an absolute beginner, would feel overwhelmed in the slightest. She's very encouraging throughout the DVD as well as very thorough.  I would like to note that I do believe that this DVD is an excellent investment for the experienced artisan as well.  She is an absolute terrific instructor and I don't think that this purchase is one you'll regret.  I look forward to purchasing more of her DVD's as well as her books.  I hope that the reader will find this helpful, because I really feel that it's more than appropriate to sing her praises.",1314921600,,2589,4.6
8294550,5,B001DQPXT8,This video was awesome and inspiring!  I probably made 20 rings after I watched it and they're all awesome.  I didn't even know I had it in me :-)  Thanks Sharilyn!,1221091200,,164,4.225806451612903
8294551,5,B001DQPXT8,This is another fabulous DVD by Sharilyn.  She gives you everything you need to make gorgeous rings that everyone will envy.,1218499200,,124,4.904761904761905
8294552,5,B001DQPXT8,"About six months ago I bought a copy of Sharilyn Miller's Rings of Beauty.  If you're a jewelry artisan or you hope to be one, do yourself a favor and buy this video.  It is unbelievably good!  I have been able to produce well over 300 rings.  My family, friends and customers think I'm some kind of jewelry wizard.  Trust me, I'm not.  But you'll be amazed at the rings you're able to make after watching this DVD.  Miller is a great jewelry talent and she's also a superb instructor.  I sincerely hope that she produces a sequel to this video because I'll be her first customer.",1218499200,2,580,4.355140186915888
8294553,5,B001DQPXT8,"Like all of Sharilyn's DVD's this one has a very useful introduction covering the tools you will need and how to go about using them. The DVD is broken down into chapters in which she demonstrates the steps and techniques very clearly. Since there is a description of what each chapter covers, you are able to go back easily to review something if you feel you need to.

Another plus is that the camera is behind her so you view her hands as she works and can look down at your own and make sure that you are doing what she is. This makes it very easy to follow her. If there is something that might be a little tricky, she makes sure that there is a close up.

I was particularly impressed with her demonstration of how to make sure the rings fit correctly.

Thanks, Sharilyn, for another great DVD.",1218499200,3,800,4.28476821192053
8294554,5,B001DQPXT8,"With this DVD I was able to make all the rings you see on the title page and it was so much fun! The excellent teaching style of Sharilyn Miller is simple to follow and if you are a visual learner like I am, you won't have any problems creating all the designs she teaches here. The most challenging was the nautilus ring, which is made with one continuous piece of wire. These rings are quick and simple to make as gifts for friends, family and yourself. Your friends will all want you to make them one (or more).",1218499200,3,514,4.202020202020202

8294556,5,B001DQPXT8,"This video is great for showing you different types of wire rings.  It shows how to get a good fit and well as design and structural integrity.  You will love designing your own rings, just by doing variations on what Sharilyn shows on the video!!",1218412800,,247,4.466666666666667
