8130946,5,B000GEDO44,"Great young SRK movie. Not quite as good as Anjaam, but better than Karan-Arjun, at least in my opinion. Great story of three brothers, with excellent acting by Jackie Shroff, Anil Kappor and Shah Rukh with all the melodrama you expect of a film with evil men worshiping Durga.  I really enjoyed it, but it won't be for everyone.",1521417600,,329,4.576271186440678
