5360353,5,B009P7K1CG,The English version is very unique and well crafted.  Jiri has done great work in the past and this movie is nothing short of magical. The movie kept my attention from beginning to end and the voice-overs fit the characters perfectly. My girlfriends two daughters really enjoyed it. Two thumbs up.,1362009600,6,297,4.823529411764706
5360354,4,B009P7K1CG,"This film is actually a recycling of a 2009  Czech Republic film.  I saw it when abroad and while it is a distinctive and visually appealing stop-motion film, some of the characters are quite scary/disturbing, especially the cigar toting vile bust/statue known as ""Head.""  Head leads the evil ""side"" of the attic against the peace loving ""side"" of the attic.  A rag-tag group from the peace loving side must overcome the evil Head and rescue a kidnaped antique doll.  The voice casting is great, lots of big names and the stop-motion filming is artistic, however, the dark edge of the film may steer this towards the tweens and up (maybe 8-10 and up?).  If you're not sure, you might want to preview it before the kids get a chance to see it.  Other than the caution for the scary factor, definitely worth viewing artsy imaginative work.",1351641600,18,837,4.691780821917808

5360356,2,B009P7K1CG,"I'm  writing this review as I watch it.

20 minutes in:  Animation is wonderful, but I am thoroughly bored out of my mind.  Stopped the film to read reviews.  Decided I will continue.  Started this review.
30 minutes in:  1 interesting and mildly dark thing has happened.  At this point, I'm rooting for the cat.
45 minutes in:  Very creative use of materials to achieve special effects.  Still bored by the story.  I can see why people say this is too disturbing for little kids.  Older kids would have no problems with it, but I can't see this appealing to older children until they become teenagers in high school --- or maybe college students -- who have serious interest in art and film making.  The cat is still my favorite character.
1 hour in:  I feel like the plaster headed bust character is cheating on the animation.  It makes sense, but still...  Otherwise, I'm very impressed from a technical achievement point, yet I've seen enough.  I don't care about any of the characters; I want the good guys to fail as that could make it interesting.  On the other hand, the villains are dull too.  There's only 18 minutes left, so I'll stick it out.  Not enough cat in the last 15 minutes.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS

End credits: Ugh, Buttercup clones; and it was pointless.  I did enjoy the disco celebration, even if it was short-lived.  The impromptu black hole was just bizarre, and not in a good way as a story-telling device.  The cat just completely disappears from the story; of course the one character I liked gets hosed.

I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but I was sorely disappointed.  People say this is dark, but only marginally.  It's spectacularly made, but dull.  It's great eye candy, but a bland kidnapping story.",1430438400,,1747,4.636065573770492
5360357,5,B009P7K1CG,Great kids movie,1422835200,,16,4.666666666666667

5360359,5,B009P7K1CG,Hard story to follow.  Condition: good.,1417737600,,39,5.5
5360360,3,B009P7K1CG,No complaints but a bit disappointed at the story line. I love animated films including claymations but this one fell short of expectations. More appropriate for very young children.,1408838400,,182,5.310344827586207
5360361,4,B009P7K1CG,"Wow, What can I say.  This was a very cool movie.  I liked it because it's off the beaten bath and very entertaining.  the effort was well played and the quality shows in the end product. I will watch this many times over.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.  It sneaks up on you...",1404259200,,295,4.017241379310345
5360362,1,B009P7K1CG,The mix of animations was interesting. The plot was not. Even my children were disappointed. Do not waste your time.,1396656000,,116,4.85
5360363,5,B009P7K1CG,"This movie has the old style of stop animation. It's like a grittier version of a Wes Anderson stop animation film. There's some innovative techniques used in the film. It's a hipster delight of retro inspired imagery. Since it comes from a different country, many of the things in the film may seem creepy, strange or really weird to a mainstream USA audience. My 1.5 year old son loves this movie. But I think fans of indie art, fine art, lo-fi, stop motion animation, retro inspired art, anti mainstream creativity, foreign film will love this movie. If you're looking for another toy story or Pixar film or American commercial cgi you will be disappointed.",1394755200,,660,4.798245614035087
5360364,3,B009P7K1CG,"This never really clicked for me.

I think I kept expecting something better, and it never arrived.

Or may I was comparing it with /A Town Called Panic/. It is, trust me, no /A Town Called Panic/. Not even close.

Then again, since it is rated PG, I may be a lot older than the target audience, and the target audience may love it.",1389571200,,332,4.15625
5360365,3,B009P7K1CG,"A little bit of a change up for us... definitely not for a young family. I didn't hate it, an older soul may appreciate it.",1379203200,,123,3.96
5360366,3,B009P7K1CG,"A rare and enchanting experience, not unlike Toy Story but darker and grittier. For a more mature audience as well since the themes are more complex and visually intense.",1378166400,2,170,4.896551724137931
5360367,4,B009P7K1CG,"This was a little like watching Gumby. Yes, it was Claymation and the toys looked a little creepy to me, but my 6 year old daughter somehow enjoyed it so I have to give it at least a 4-star. She's actually watched it at least 3 x now since I've bought it for Christmas.  The story does at least have a good moral value to it so that makes up for the creepy appearance of some of the characters.  It has a very old European feel to it, lol.  The main character is an old porcelain doll which creeps me out to begin with, but don't judge me on that. I've probably seen Chucky too many times.",1376697600,2,589,4.017094017094017
5360368,1,B009P7K1CG,"Very dark movie with lots of violence and stalking evil. I love kids movies, but this just isn't one. Sorry I bought it.",1376006400,,120,4.260869565217392
5360369,5,B009P7K1CG,We purchased this Toys in the Attic movie for our two granddaughters and they absolutely love this movie.  They would recoomend that others purchase this movie.,1375747200,2,160,5.153846153846154
5360370,4,B009P7K1CG,goo for the kids collection I started. hope the grandkids enjoy it as of yet they haven't watched it. hopeful,1374105600,,109,4.5
5360371,2,B009P7K1CG,Apparently it was a bit to cerebral for me.  I found the movie confusing and just plain odd.  I should be interesting to share it with unsuspecting family members.,1373414400,,163,4.586206896551724
5360372,1,B009P7K1CG,"Rented this after stellar reviews.  Regretted it after slogging through about 30 mins hoping it would get better.  The stop motion gimmick appears to be on the level that a group of schoolchildren might be capable of, but that can be charming at times. Painfully slow.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer who said it is definitely not for young children.",1373155200,,357,4.725806451612903
5360373,5,B009P7K1CG,"This is a great family movie. It's very different and a little weird at times, but it is obviously from the point of view of a child and how a child sees the world and how they use their imaginations when playing with their toys. I very much enjoyed this movie and so did my 4, 6, 7, and 8yo. My kids are really into how movies are made and different forms of ""animation"" and they have fun with every aspect of this movie. It has some live action; clay people, a wooden puppet, and dolls, all done with stop animation; and some hand-drawn ""filler"" that my kids had fun pointing out. Its a cute story about good vs. bad and how to overcome obstacles. I loved how they made bed sheets and plastic sheeting into water (my kids were wowed by that) and floating pillows were clouds. After we watched the movie, my kids grabbed some stuff around the house and started to imitate what they watched, so it fueled their creativity :)

All in all, I have no idea why so many people keep saying this isn't for small children, its exactly how children play and use their imaginations!!!!",1372291200,,1075,4.348258706467662
5360374,5,B009P7K1CG,"I really liked this movie. It may not be for everyone, but my family and I thought it was great. We will watch it again.",1370995200,,120,3.84
5360375,5,B009P7K1CG,This movie is a definite children's movie.  It would bore an adult to death.  Would recommend not to purchase if you have no children.  Seller mailed fast with no issues. 5 STARS!,1370563200,,179,4.53125
5360376,2,B009P7K1CG,"I thought this would be an interesting movie for my 5 yrs old granddaughter. Boy, was I mistaken. I wouldn't advise for small children to watch.",1370044800,,144,4.576923076923077
5360377,3,B009P7K1CG,"But ""Different"" certainly does not make it great. At one point, early in the movie I said to my grand daughter ""This is weird, and weird enough that I HAVE to keep watching,"" We both liked it, but neither of us loved it. We give it a grade of C+

BTW...I was sure we ordered the HD download version, but on our smart TV it was 4;3 letterbox, not widescreen, and did not appear to be in HD. That was dissapointing",1368316800,,412,4.08641975308642

5360379,4,B009P7K1CG,"For those who don't like CGI instead of stop-motion, this an outstanding feature, though it may well be the last movie of its kind. Excellently done, a bit strange/offbeat, but engaging.",1367107200,,186,5.032258064516129
5360380,5,B009P7K1CG,these toys looked after each other with great care!  thats what made me enjoy all the adventures of each toy!  great show!,1366934400,4,122,4.5
5360381,1,B009P7K1CG,Horrible movie.  Felt like torcher having to sit through this movie.  I can't imagine anyone liking this movie.  Just watch the preview - I should have known if the preview sucks the movie has no chance of being any better.  I want my $3.99 back.,1366416000,3,246,4.4
5360382,5,B009P7K1CG,Great movie. There was so much work put into this movie and you can really tell. I have bought some for gifts.,1364515200,3,110,4.045454545454546
5360383,4,B009P7K1CG,"This movie takes you to a strange and dark world of forgotten toys living in the attic of a house using the classic, rough form of stop-motion animation.  The story in itself starts out slow and whimsical as you enter the lives of the toys, but things get more and more strange as the story goes on.  These toys carry on with their lives until a dark character, looming in a dank and dreary part of the attic, begins to meddle in their lives.  With this bizarre, imaginative world and mixture of wonderful, old-school art, I definitely recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the work that went into this movie.  This movie, however, has very dark undertones and can be scary to some young viewers.  But, my two-year-old daughter seemed to enjoy the movie.  This is definitely one of those to gather the family together and grab some sweets for movie night.",1364515200,5,861,4.594771241830065
5360384,5,B009P7K1CG,"I mean really, I stand in awe.

I didn't know, at first, that this was by Jiri (pronounced kind of like ""Year-zhee"") Barta. That would have sold me right then, since Czech&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/animators/dp/6305779635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">animators</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barta/dp/B000GTJS9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barta</a>&nbsp;in particular display senses of the macabre, joyous, heroic, delicate, and mysterious all at once. (Since so many of them worked, or tried to, during the Soviet oppression, that seems rather natural.)

This, like any brilliant work of art, works at many levels. Physically the puppets and objects combine Svankamjer's sensibilities with Joseph Cornell's supply closet. In image creation, Barta melds live action with flip-books (or something close), stop animation, overdrawing, and I don't know what-all in computer animation and postproduction. The stop-animated puppets, however, embody unique personalities in their materials, structure, and articulation, even before you hear them speak,

Skipping ahead, I have to applaud the English language rendering. Taken in itself, it expresses the characters and helps bring them to life, even though English was never considered when the movie's original Czech version came out. But, the English is dubbed so it syncs to Czech mouth movements (mostly). This involved heroics on the parts of the scriptwriters, voice actors, and sound masters to create some cadence that a lip-reader might believe.

Backing up to the original, though, this represents a rather daring fable of personal freedom against the militarists, something Barta lived through before the Velvet Revolution. The plaster talking head had some reality in the Stalin era, and the spies and operatives remained real until the Stasi got their pink slips.

Behind and in front of everything else, though, this stands out as a major artwork, masterfully crafted and carrying more meaning than any one reading can disclose. I've admired Barta's art before. This, however, impresses me in more different ways than I can hope to name.
