POT O' GOLD (1941) - James Stewart, Paulette Goddard, Horace Heidt, Charles Winninger, Mary Gordon, Frank Melton (uncredited: Art Carney, Bud Jamison, Nestor Paiva)
In a picture loosely adapted from a popular radio program, James Stewart, master of many cinematic genres (including comedy), struggles with the only one he was never comfortable in: the musical. Jimmy performs ""When Johnny Toots His Horn"" while co-star Paulette Goddard is backed by Horace Heidt's band on ""Pete the Piper"" and ""Broadway Caballero."" Stewart also fakes playing the harmonica, but actually took up the instrument as a result of some off-screen tutelage here from Jerry Adler (Larry's brother).

MADE FOR EACH OTHER (1939) - Carole Lombard, Jimmy Stewart, Charles Coburn, Lucile Watson, Eddie Quillan (uncredited: Ward Bond, Raymond Bailey)
