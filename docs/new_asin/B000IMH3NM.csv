8403830,1,B000IMH3NM,this material is out of date. the videos are old and are pointless there is no direction to the video.,1389052800,,102,4.15
8403831,5,B000IMH3NM,"While other reviewers have complained about this item being produced on DVD recordable media, I appreciate that this title is available at all.  I understand the market is limited for this item and it could not be made available on factory produced media as the cost would be prohibitive.  The quality is fine, there are nice usable menus, and if you can open your mind enough to get beyond the ""DVD recordable means bootleg"" meme you can have a good time watching substance use and abuse portrayed in a wonderfully dated and hilarious manner...",1381881600,,545,4.787234042553192
8403832,1,B000IMH3NM,"I understand this is supposed to be a place to review the product, but this product is a little different.
This is not a commercial DVD. Yumheart (the seller, really a guy named Peter) has gathered these videos and burns them onto DVDs.  At first I was annoyed that he didn't mention this in his description (I'm an avid DVD collector and never buy burned/bootleg/former rental movies), but then I figured if I enjoy the videos why should it matter if its not a commercially made dvd?
I wish I had noticed this when making the purchase...Yumheart is labled the producer. Yumheart is the only one to review the product (not anymore) and you guessed it, Yumheart is the only person selling it.
He shipped the DVD's in a broken case (the peices that hold the DVD in the center and the case dosen't close all the way).  The second DVD was very scratched on the bottom toward the end of the disc stopping playback (since the disc was in its ""seat"" when I opened it I have to assume the scratching was done before shipping).  Also on the second disc right channel audio completely drops out after the fourth video and I assume all the way to the end of the disc.
He didn't respond to a week and a half of e-mails until the day I left negative feedback...that got his attention.  He then said if I wanted a replacement I would have to remove the negative feedback.  I really do like the videos and wanted a working copy so I removed the feedback.  Later that week I recieved a replacment that had the exact same problem (audio drops out).
I really don't appriciate the fact that this guy forced me to remove negative feedback (which I still feel he totally deserves) so he could ship me another defective item...knowing that I couldn't leave more feedback since Amzaon has the genius policy if you delete feedback you can't leave new comments in its place.  This is my work around.
I don't know if this is the same with all the sets or if I just happened to get two fluke sets.  This time he didn't respond to e-mails so I filed a claim with Amazon.
The videos are great; I don't dispute that.  I would give it a five if I'd got a working set...but I can't in good consciousness let this guy jerk around other people without giving them a heads up seeing as he is the ""manufacturer"" and only seller of the disc.",1187308800,10,2304,4.377049180327869
