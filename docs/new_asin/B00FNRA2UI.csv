8617334,5,B00FNRA2UI,"Excellent crisp copy of this slightly unusual B western.  Nice to see these old Buck Jones westerns being brought out on DVD. Cost is a little high considering this is on DVD-R.  But if you are a collector of B westerns, this is a must have. Ward Bond is a co-star as one of the bad guys.",1412380800,2,288,4.035087719298246
