8292093,4,B001D72RM8,"I don't know who that is on the cover, but it looks nothing like the girl who plays Red Riding Hood. Anyway, this is probably the weakest of the three as the wolf is bad and as a result not as funny. While this is essential viewing to understand the story, the third film Red Riding Hood and the Monsters is the funniest. Once the wolf turns good, the movies really go off the rails (in a good way). These are great movies to make you feel like a kid again. The quality is so much better than former releases. Do yourself a favor and buy the 3-pack. And yes kids, you do have to read sub-titles if you don't speak Spanish. I know no one likes to read anymore but too bad.",1333324800,,671,4.052631578947368
8292094,5,B001D72RM8,i remember this movie when i was a child and am now able to share with my students another version of little red riding hood in spanish... this film also contains english subtitles which does not do it justice because the film in it's original language is the best.,1243123200,,265,4.428571428571429
