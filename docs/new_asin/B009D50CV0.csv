8540086,5,B009D50CV0,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid and two songs dogged me for half a century, ""Small Fry,"" and ""Pocket Full of Dream."" It's great to finally own a terrific print of the movie. Crosby, MacMurray, and Elizabeth Patterson are all terrific, but a 12 year old Donald O'Connor steals the movie.",1475452800,,294,4.363636363636363
8540087,5,B009D50CV0,"Delightful, charming, wonderful -- an intimate boutique musical starring the great Bing Crosby, with Fred MacMurray not only singing but doing one number in drag, as a not-so-little old lady, plus child star Donald O'Connor in his film debut (a slightly older O'Connor appears later in Warners' ""On Your Toes""). They're all pretty darn enchanting in this tale of the middle-class Beebes of California and their slapdash pursuits of happiness, with Elizabeth Patterson, ""Mrs. Trumble"" of ""I Love Lucy"" in the TV '50s, already looking elderly in 1938 as the widow Beebe, mother to the troubled sons played by the three stars. The pleasant songs include ""Pocketful of Dreams"" (which, critics have mentioned, should really have been the title of the picture) and the topper, the pop classic, ""Small Fry,"" written by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser.  This modest and unpretentious film vivant represents a gathering of giants in the talent department, yet floats through the air with the greatest of ease. We can thank Crosby, the man who invented ""chill"" decades before its time, and maverick producer-director Wesley Ruggles, for that. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel like you could float through air, too.  Out of circulation for years, ""Sinners"" is the definition and epitome of a rediscovered classic, the kind of movie that might be shown in heaven on Saturday nights, in part because that's where its charismatic stars live now. God bless them all.",1471651200,2,1464,5.095833333333333
