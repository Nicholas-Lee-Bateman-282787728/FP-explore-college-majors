5993187,3,B00FI7SW3W,THE VIDEO IS GREAT AND IT WORKS BUT ON JEANETTES WEBSITE IT ISONLY 19.95 even with shipping its cheaper than this!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU DON't HAVE TOOO!,1392508800,2,163,4.466666666666667
5993188,2,B00FI7SW3W,"I got this DVD thinking it would be great from the previews I saw, But when I watched the whole thing not so much. It's too fast in my opinion but it might be for someone else.",1390262400,,176,3.7837837837837838
5993189,5,B00FI7SW3W,OMG I love this workout. It is a tough workout and I forced myself to finish the whole dvd. I wanted to give up so many times but afterwards I felt great! doing it again today for sure!,1389225600,11,185,3.8947368421052633
5993190,5,B00FI7SW3W,"Don't be fooled by the cutsy picture on the cover. this video gives a serious calorie burn and is very effective. I really like the countdown clock because it allows you to keep pushing because you know the end for the chapter is near. It is one of the best at home workouts I have ever done! Total body, total cardio, super sweat fest!",1389139200,10,336,4.265625
5993191,5,B00FI7SW3W,"This workout it exactly what I need. It targets all of the ""trouble"" areas that women often complains about. I like that each segment is timed (5-7 mins each) which kinda motivates you to complete each rep, round. I don't really have any complaints; it's definitely a challenging workout....even Kelly Rowland took breaks and did the modified version at times! Get it, you won't regret it!",1387756800,14,389,4.909090909090909
5993192,4,B00FI7SW3W,I actually like this dvd.... I wish there was an option to mute the trainers and turn the music up. Doing it everyday and hearing more talking than music can be lil less motivational. But overall I love it.,1387324800,6,206,4.3076923076923075
5993193,4,B00FI7SW3W,I am getting back into exercising regularly. This has been helpful with transitioning back to a regular exercise regimen. I like that  the workouts show how much time you have for each segment.,1385510400,8,193,4.848484848484849
5993194,4,B00FI7SW3W,"This work-out is hard if you are a beginner but if you keep at it...is will get easier. I;m on my third day. I haven't made it through the entire DVD, I alternate my work-out bychapters.",1384214400,5,186,4.194444444444445
5993195,5,B00FI7SW3W,I can see a diffence in mii my && mii health I love dis work out but it can be hard for you if you are not fit,1383436800,2,110,2.9642857142857144
5993196,5,B00FI7SW3W,Great Workout video it gets the job done!!!,1433548800,,43,4.5
5993197,5,B00FI7SW3W,LOVE THIS WORKOUT,1430438400,,17,5.0
5993198,5,B00FI7SW3W,This is such a good workout! I'm a beginner cause I don't work out too often and this was easy to follow along and she keeps you motivated to finish.,1428192000,2,149,4.0
5993199,5,B00FI7SW3W,"Great workout! Challenging with really fun moves. Background of the room looks like it is from the late 1990's, but the enthusiasm of Jeanette and Kelly are enough to distract from it. Chapters work well so that you can individualize your workout plan and not be committed to do the entire thing if you are short on time.",1427328000,,321,4.551724137931035
5993200,5,B00FI7SW3W,This is a great workout. I would love to have been offered standing modifications for the planking which is done quite a bit. Modifications are offered through out the entire workout but not enough options for ppl w limited range of motion or knee issues.  Each 5 minute segment works you to the max. The ab segment is a killer. I could have done without all the happy chatter between jj and kr. I like how they both encourage you to hang in there and don't give up. Not a fan of the yoga piece during the cool down either. The workout itself is challenging and  will leave you dripping. This will definitely stay in the top of my rotation,1424995200,2,639,4.316666666666666
5993201,5,B00FI7SW3W,I am still doing the dvd but I am seeing a lot of changes in my body and muscle tolerance.,1424995200,,90,3.55
5993202,3,B00FI7SW3W,not what i expected but I do love this trainer other videos,1424217600,,59,4.0
5993203,5,B00FI7SW3W,"I'm having fun with this dvd. It does get you up and moving. Jeanette is a beast. The work out is a real work. Its not too fast, so you can pick up the moves. Some stuff may be hard for someone who has never done the moves before but once you get it down your love it.",1424044800,,268,3.6379310344827585
5993204,5,B00FI7SW3W,"OMG! This is the best workout tape I have ever purchased.  This will be the last tape that I will ever need.  Do not think that you will be able to go through the entire thing in the beginning.  You have to work yourself up to it.  While you are doing that you are toning and losing and before you know it, you are finally in shape to complete the tape.  Disclaimer: I have not gotten to the end of the tape yet.  I am still working on it.  If you ever wanted a personal trainer but could not afford one, then this tape is for you.",1422230400,,531,3.9065420560747666
5993205,4,B00FI7SW3W,Workout is on point!! But Kelly is annoying. Just have to tune her out.,1417910400,,71,4.142857142857143
5993206,5,B00FI7SW3W,Can't Wait For More From The Duo!,1413936000,,33,3.857142857142857
5993207,5,B00FI7SW3W,Best workout video ever! Jeanette does NOT play around. It's a hard core workout but definitely worth it!!,1412294400,,106,4.944444444444445
5993208,5,B00FI7SW3W,Hard but good.  I like that it is broken down into 5 minutes segments so you can do as much (or as little) as you like.  It's tough but works a lot of body parts and is challenging even with modifications.  The yoga/stretch ends it nicely.,1407369600,,239,4.1521739130434785
5993209,5,B00FI7SW3W,Awesome workout,1407110400,,15,7.0
5993210,5,B00FI7SW3W,Great. Had to get used to working out,1406937600,,37,3.75
5993211,5,B00FI7SW3W,Love this dvd! I am currently 250lbs and was afraid that I would not be able to keep up. But Jeannette provides a modified version that still works you out really good! I won't lie sometimes the moves can be challenging but that is what I need... to keep pushing myself and not be lazy so I would recommend this to someone who is out of shape or in shape. I have been doing the dvd for a little over a month and I have lost 7lbs so far. I have only had time to do it about twice a week and i am beginning to see my body take on a new shape. I am more toned and my curves are becoming more defined and less jiggly. I am excited! Just seeing how my body is beginning to take shape has motivated me to keep going! I just picked up her cardio dance dvd for when i want to have a little more fun with my workout. I'll be sure to post a review after i try that one also.,1406764800,3,864,3.7790055248618786
5993212,5,B00FI7SW3W,Great work out ! It is a bit intense but she does warn you. This DVD is very flexible. The chapters are broken up into 5 minute increments which allows you to gradually build your endurance. Definitely a great buy.,1404086400,4,214,4.375
5993213,5,B00FI7SW3W,"I did this one today for the first time, and am so glad i did!  I was a little hesitant to purchase. I'm a personal trainer and I like a challenging workout--I love, love, love Cathe Friedrich and always suggest her DVDs to my clients. However, looking to mix things up a bit, I found Jeanette's Bikini Boot Camp and loved the cardio on there, so decided to try this one. While it is not completely cardio (the long and lean segment left me a little...well, I was not a fan, but it's okay, that's just 7 minutes in an otherwise excellent workout), it does make you sweat.",1402444800,2,571,4.287037037037037
5993214,5,B00FI7SW3W,I have quite a large library of workout DVDs because I'm easily bored. This one ranks as one of the most challenging. I was gasping for breath at minute three of the second chapter. I only wish the DVD allowed you to choose chapters to create a custom workout.,1400889600,2,260,4.326530612244898
5993215,5,B00FI7SW3W,I love this DVD you can work your way up by doing lil mini sections before you do the whole entire DVD.  Or if you only have 30 mins you can pick 3-5 section a have a mega workout love it I use it 2-3 times a week,1398470400,3,213,3.4375
8615866,5,B00FI7SW3W,"Jeanettes workouts are some of my absolute favorites.  I save hers for my weekends when I have a little bit more time to dedicate because they're a bit longer.  This is a complete body work out; hits everything  arms, legs, abs and cardio.  Ive been doing this one for the past year (about once every week or two) and it still kicks my butt.  I love it! (also love her Bikini Bootcamp 2)",1527897600,,387,4.2465753424657535
8615867,3,B00FI7SW3W,"This is the 5th JJ video I have and was excited to get it. But I have to say, I won't be doing it much. I'll do every 3-4 months, when I've forgotten the workout.

Kelly Rowland is a dark beauty, but you wouldn't know it from the cover of this video or the picture on the DVD. Why did the producers feel the need to lighten Kelly's skin? Hummmm.

This workout so beyond advanced. It is so difficult and almost impossible to do all the way through that even JJ and Kelly can't do it. They edit the video every section, so they could have easily taken a break and came back. I'm not sure this workout is even healthy for people to do all the way through. I workout 6 days a week (intense workouts and indoor rock climbing).

Way too many plank sessions as well.

I ended up cutting the video in half and stopped at the BACK session, then picked up the rest the next day.

I didn't enjoy this workout. There is no joy in doing this workout; not even a feeling of accomplishment because it is just too much.

I gave it a 3 because I LOVE JJ and didn't have the heart to give her a 2. But I would not recommend this workout to a beginner or advanced.",1506038400,2,1145,4.04424778761062
8615868,4,B00FI7SW3W,Good workout when you don't feel like leaving your home.  I like how the chapters are separated but it would be nice if you could customize the chapters before beginning instead of playing all at once or having to stop and skip to a desired chapter.,1502755200,,249,4.413043478260869
8615869,5,B00FI7SW3W,"Whew! Is the first thought that comes to mind. I did this workout first the first time the other day. It is a killer workout, I wasn't able to finish it. I workout at an intermediate level. Jeanette doesn't play. She is a great trainer and very motivating. I think it wouldn't be a good dvd for beginners. But for intermediate and advanced person it's great. I highly recommend this dvd. Can't wait to do the workout again and be able to finish it. Very heart pumping and you will be super sweaty.",1498867200,,497,4.354838709677419
8615870,5,B00FI7SW3W,Havent used it yet but I am sure the tape is good since it is celebrity workout trainer.,1479686400,,88,3.9444444444444446
8615871,5,B00FI7SW3W,"This video is so much fun and a total butt kicker!
Jeanette and Kelly are funny, energetic and engaging. You feel like you are going to an afternoon workout class with your girlfriends, but this routine is no walk in the park. It is a SERIOUS calorie burner and tones, tightens and stretches your body.
I am very proud of myself every time I make it through the entire video from start to finish - I am a fit person and let me tell you - it is hard! The great energy of Jeanette and Kelly make you stick with it and the short sub-sessions help the time pass quickly. Highly recommended!
Also the sub sessions make it easy to pick and choose areas of the body you want to focus on if your exercise regime is divided between upper body days, lower body days, etc.",1471132800,2,761,4.219178082191781
8615872,4,B00FI7SW3W,"I've had this DVD for a while now. When I first purchased it I was just getting back into working out so I watched it and tried the warm up and was already out of breath. So I told myself I would put it up until I was in better shape. Well I feel that I'm in better shape because I've been exercing five times a week consistently for about six weeks, so I tried it yesterday. This time I could get through the warm up and the first half of the first section. I didn't give up but I had to take like a two minute drink and hydrate. Then I got back to it. I did up though, I did 41 of the 69 minutes. I had somewhere to be plus I didn't want to overwork myself. I plan to do the last 28 minutes and the warm up today. Definitely makes you sweat. I wish should would come out with a shorter just as effective DVD- maybe 45 minutes tops. Overall loved it! Its tough but you can make yourself get through it even if you have to breaks like I did.",1466294400,2,941,3.830769230769231
8615873,4,B00FI7SW3W,I really like this workout.  A variety of exercises and chapters to select.  Jeanette and Kelly are very positive and motivating.  The only thing is that my wrists can't take so many plank moves.  That is just a personal complaint.  I modify as needed and alternate this dvd with Jeanette's others.,1437350400,,298,4.764705882352941
8615874,5,B00FI7SW3W,This is an excellent work out dvd!,1433894400,,34,4.0
8615875,3,B00FI7SW3W,"Although I love the fact that women of color created this workout video, it's not user-friendly for everyone.  I have bad knees and a bad lower back so I have to modify a lot of the exercises or skip them all together.  I would love to get sex abs and sculpt my body, but this DVD is not it for me.",1433548800,4,298,3.8688524590163933
