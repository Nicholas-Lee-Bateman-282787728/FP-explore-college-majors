8467908,5,B005E7SEU2,"I can't say enough good things about this video. It is perfect for babies and toddlers because they are short music videos that keep the baby entertained, rather than 30-minute episodes or movies, which are too long for a baby or toddler. My daughter loves these. Wish they were easier to get a hold of so I could give them to everybody.",1396310400,,337,4.451612903225806
