8149347,1,B000J6H1DE,"I ordered this and several other DVD's for my Massage business.  Today I was very excited to finally complete my order with learning Table Thai. Well, much to my surprise, inside the correct DVD covering, was an MP3-CD of Mindsight, The Science of Personal Transformation!!!!! WHAT??? Oh, no! Tried to find a number to call for help, but there is none. Now what? No way to call Amazon and let them know someone in the packaging end of this has really goofed! Still do not have my training, and hope that I do not have to go to the trouble of returning this. I will update if Amazon replaces this order with correct DVD.",1308009600,,619,4.4298245614035086
8149348,1,B000J6H1DE,This dvd Thai massage: introduction for mat and table did not show how to give a thai massage on the table.  What it did was explain how to do the thai massage on a mat.  Saying that you can transfer this to a table is inaccurate and a demonstration and instruction on the table should have been included to make the title correct.  Would not recommend.,1304812800,,353,4.318181818181818

8149353,5,B000J6H1DE,"This DVD is awesome. I think it's appropriate for anyone interested in Thai Massage. It teaches you a full length Northern-style session that takes over an hour and can be done on the mat or the table.

I was able to understand everything even though I was only minimally exposed to Thai massage before. It's beautifully produced and includes authentic footage the author shot in Thailand along with sections on Thai herbs, HandsFree Thai that really completes the teaching experience.

I wished those sections could've been a bit longer but since the DVD is already over 90 minutes, I'm happy he focused on presenting the Thai massage techniques so fully. This is a great tool for massage therapists who want to incorporate authentic Thai massage into their practice.",1163548800,14,768,4.9921875
