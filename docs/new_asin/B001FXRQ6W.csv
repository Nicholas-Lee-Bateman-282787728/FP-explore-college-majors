3589600,1,B001FXRQ6W,"Yes, Red Hook is slowly being gentrified, with condos on the rise and rumors of mega-stores always in the air.  Its story is worth your time, but this film is not worth your time.  It's a poorly made student film at best, without a specific thesis, made by a film-maker who doesn't seem to understand the relationship the area has with the rest of Brooklyn or the history of the neighborhood.  All he seems to know is what a few random talking heads have to say about it, or rather, what they have to say about themselves as they relate to Red Hook.  It appears as if it started out as a documentary about the film-maker's friend, a Cornell architecture student who is attempting an urban Alexander Supertramp-like existence in Red Hook for a summer project about usable space among soon-to-be-displaced homeless folk.  After 2 more interviews it expanded - but only slightly.
The neighborhood has long been split in 2 - those in the homes and those in the projects - but the film-maker only speaks with 2 or 3 eccentric white people who have called the area home in order to get the history of the neighborhood, but this only tells (barely) half the story of Red Hook.  Other than some brief interviews with people on the street (half of them teenage graffiti artists), no public officials, neighborhood committee members or even an attempt at a statement from IKEA, are given a voice to other viewpoints.  Instead, the history of the neighborhood goes back only as far as the 3 white peoples' own interests relate, and most come off as anthropologists studying primitive tribes when referring to the projects.  There are plenty of people who can tell you about the rich history of Red Hook - how it was cut off from the rest of Carroll Gardens by the BQE; the mariners quarters that used to reside there, the gangs and drug trafficking - but either the film completely lacks focus or the film-maker was too lazy to seek it out.  Running at a lengthy 46 minutes, I'm thinking probably both. Alas, in the end, all we get is a view through a hole in the fence.",1304640000,3,2059,4.558265582655826

8303038,5,B001FXRQ6W,"This is a documentary about a hole in a fence. Many themes emerge. The best thing about it, is there no very specific theme or agenda. Every now and then you see a sight or a space and there is something interesting about it. What would you find if you took the time to explore it and find out the stories surrounding it? What if you interacted with the space and the people in it or someone else from outside the natural environment or storyline did that and told you about it? That's what this documentary does.",1437264000,,513,4.298969072164948
8303039,3,B001FXRQ6W,"A so-so documentary.  The person filming the documentary puts up a shelter in an abandoned area of Red Hook, NY.  Graffitee covered walls mark the area with a standing pool of water in the middle called, ""The Yard"".  Most of the film centers around interviews with people in the area.  The conversation is about IKEA and the plans to develop the area.  There are plenty of pictures in the area, but nothing exciting really happens.  If you are looking for adventure, this probably isn't the documentary for you.  This is more of a what's happening in a place undergoing change to a commercially re-built location.  Good for one view if you are really bored.",1419206400,,657,4.701754385964913
8303040,1,B001FXRQ6W,We really did not understand what the purpose was to this film. Was it about neighborhoods and what happens when big business comes in? Was it about the plight of the homeless? Was it about architecture and creativity? There were so many themes put forth - we kept waiting for it to all come together and it never did. It was not very compelling to watch.,1414368000,,355,4.393939393939394

8303043,4,B001FXRQ6W,"A hole in a fence grants us a captivating view into Red Hook. It is a snapshot of this Brooklyn neighborhood at a time when so much is changing in its make-up. The film maker chose wonderfully eclectic characters and obviously has a real knack for making them feel comfortable in front of a camera. Their responses are candid and bring depth to the film. I also greatly appreciate that the film does not attempt to overreach and feed the audience a pre-chewed meal, instead it does what worth while pieces of art often do: it asks important questions.",1356739200,,551,4.575757575757576
8303044,5,B001FXRQ6W,"An engaging documentary about the Red Hook neighborhood in Brooklyn that thoughtfully pulls in themes of class, race, change, and gentrification in a very worthwhile look at one of New York's more complex but lesser known neighborhoods. Well-crafted and original, with implications for urban living that reach far beyond the streets of Brooklyn.",1322265600,,345,5.528301886792453
