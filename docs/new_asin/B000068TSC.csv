1726546,5,B000068TSC,I finally got to see this Film recently&couldn't stop feeling the depth&Realness of the film.this Film is straight up in your face&doesn't hide from what went down back in the day.it touches on so many levels. Films like this truly Kept it real&also are a front runner to much of what we see&hear today.,1063497600,5,303,4.62962962962963
1726547,1,B000068TSC,"There is something wrong with this DVD at chapter 5 where Sonny takes a hit of weed from 2 pimps at first I thought the echos I was hearing was part of the scene but as soon as the scene continued into the high school scene with his confrontation with the hawks the echoing continued.  It ends as soon as chapter 6 starts up with the 1st gang battle between the lords and the hawks.  I decided to check the old tape I had of TEO Sonny Carson and the guess what, the echos were not present anywhere in the movie.  That means somwhere between the master print and the DVD master somebody forgot to check for audio sync in the transfer.  To top it all off all throughout the movie there is video noise on moving edges; I though only amateur/hobbyist of VCD/SVCD/DVD did this.  This is a great movie about the tough times that young black Sonny Carson faced in Brooklyn and rose up from.  But the production that went into this DVD practically destroys any enjoyable experience one can get from this movie.  So my suggestion is to wait for a re-release (not likely) or buy the tape; then you yourself can make a better DVD version of the movie than the guy jonfilms@aol.com did.  (jonfilms@aol.com is in the credits for digitizing this movies and I think he is responsible for the error in transfer from master to DVD print).  Great movie gone to waste because of carelessnes in the video transposing process.",1041984000,18,1405,4.45703125

1726607,2,B000068TSC,"This movie is flat-out horrible.  It was just too all-over-the-place; the character's transition from boy to man, and his  experiences along the way, were drastically interrupted by one extreme storyline to the next.  Not to mention, the ending was horrible.  I'm really suprised at all the other positive comments with higher ratings.",1385078400,,335,5.384615384615385
1726618,5,B000068TSC,"Great film, classic 70's NYC.... Many lessons to be acknowledged and learned. Michael Campus who also directed The Mack helmed this film with compassion, understanding and urgency.",1371686400,,180,5.703703703703703

1726621,5,B000068TSC,My mother showed me this movie when I was 14 years old and it has become one of my favorites!!! Very touching and relatable! I have it on VHS but had to get the DVD and am so glad I did!!,1360022400,,187,3.5853658536585367
1726622,4,B000068TSC,This movie was a classic and I had tried to see it for years I finally got the chance.. It was very interesting urban and gritty and very eye opening. The setting and main character was very good as well. This is what you called back in the day a Sign of the  Times. The message is in the main character Sonny Carson and what a message it turned out to be. I understand it made a big impression on some of our Rap Stars today. This is not Cooley High so don't expect it to be.,1332115200,,476,3.9072164948453607
1726623,5,B000068TSC,"Had heard about this film for some time but not seen it yet.  It's based on an actual person, but deals with a few social issues of the time, in a 70's kind of way, while still remaining somewhat light-hearted.  (As an aside, fans of Ghostface's Ironman album will finally get a chance to see the action that goes with the sound clips they've come to know.)",1328486400,4,357,4.313432835820896
1726624,3,B000068TSC,"Found this movie from listening to Tony Starks aka (Ghostface Killah: MEMBER of Wu-Tang)

This is a pretty good flick. Showing up and commings of young ""guns"" growin up and out! I love the TRUE DIALOGE that is used. I hate watching tv, movies where they don't speak the REAL way someone would in different situations, races, parts of the world.

(I mean really.... Nobody in the ""HOOD"" is saying ""Hi, Mother"" rather than ""Hay Ma"") Note really that important.. but you catch my drift.

anyway.. Good flick",1313452800,2,504,4.704545454545454
1726625,5,B000068TSC,"I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, THROUGH THE YEARS IT ALWAYS STAYED IN MY MIND, I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT SOMEONE SAVED A COPY OF IT JUST FOR ME.

1726626,5,B000068TSC,If you bought this you should know what you are getting. It is a classic both in content and story line. It is not the best movie in the world but a must see if you want to understand the mind of the inner city youth.,1296172800,,217,3.739130434782609
1726627,5,B000068TSC,Many I am sure do not know but he was the father of one of the members of X-Clan they made incredible music (With a Key sissssssies lol) Anyway This movie is a classic and probable one of the most sampled movies by rap artist ever!,1285027200,,231,4.043478260869565
1726658,5,B000068TSC,"My husband and I have listened to Ghostface Killah's Ironman cd and we would always say ""man that sound like a good movie."" Finally,I decided to do an extensive search to find out what movie he got that excert from. When I found it I was ecstatic. I ordered it as an early xmas present for my husband. The movie was good,teaches about the perils of gang and hood life back in the 70's. It was really just great to finally see the movie that both Ghostface and Mobb Deep used excerts from in music and tie them together",1232841600,,518,4.242424242424242
1726659,2,B000068TSC,"I read mostly all of the reviews for this movie before I purchased it. The story line was good but has some terrible acting in it. The movie jumped around to fast and did not blend or mesh well from scene to scene.

The actors words and mouths did not sync together. I hate watching movies like this! I tend to watch their mouth instead of the actual movie itself.",1231804800,,364,4.2
1726660,4,B000068TSC,"great movie. I just wish it would've had some more story to it, cause it was good.",1228348800,,82,3.8823529411764706

1726662,2,B000068TSC,"I liked the story line of the movie alot, but I just couldn't get over how the actors act.  At some parts it just dragged on.  And I hated the ending.  It left you hanging. Ok, his girl is on drugs and she gets to the hospital never tells you who calls the hospital or what.  and it just ends.  Does she get better do they get back together.  Yes we all know that he is going to start following the right path but come on now.  I need more.  And the pastor.  He looks like he was on drugs.  WHO KILLED LIL BOY!!!!!!!!! MAN I DONT KNOW YOU TELL ME. lol.  I don't know It just didn't do anything for me.  I liked warriors alot better.  I just felt liek they could have done something more w/ the story line. Also if you read the back of the DVD cover its like it tells you the story.  I was just disappointed at the end.",1197244800,2,818,3.878787878787879
1726663,2,B000068TSC,"I found this movie to be a typical low-budget independent movie.  The movie displayed the despair of living in urban America. This movie was the fore-father of movies/cable shows like The Wire, etc.",1178928000,,198,5.0
1726664,5,B000068TSC,"I made a great purchase, delivery was on time. And the DVD was an excellent copy. looks brand new and even better in my DVD collection. I recomend everyone to purchase from this site. youll make a great choice.",1173657600,2,210,4.410256410256411
1726665,5,B000068TSC,I tell you what I found this movie because I always wondered just where did all the samples from Ghostface Killah's 1st album came from. What I found was this movie and what I learned about the Education of Sonny Carson it was a school of hard knocks. I really enjoed this movie my friends did to. Its was interesting to see how the gangs were almost revered as like heros. During the parade they were just walking and chanting banners and all with a huge following. It's a real movie. It shows the brief celebrity status they received when living that lifestyle and when reality catches up the harsh realization that the glory days are over. This is a blaxplotation film but its not a me against the man type of thing its life that so many to this day still seem to struggle with. This is a welcomed edition to the collection and I highly recommended.,1163030400,,852,4.39873417721519
1726666,5,B000068TSC,"This movie was probably the first of its type.  Many ""life as a gang member"" films came to follow it (especially in the 1980s and 1990s), but none really did so like this one... Most the ones that followed had a tendency to be too ""Hollywood Melodramatic""-ish (at times cartoonish, and at other times somewhat preachy.)  Without spoiling the ending, though Sonny Carson makes an important decision at the end of the film, the ending is anything but happy... in fact it is often critisized for its apparent ""inconclusion"", but I disagree... It is what makes the film so great.  Almost like a documentary (""120 Blocks from Tiffany's"") the film simply tells the story and leaves the big question to be asked and answered by the viewer. Sonny has ""graduated"" from his training by society and the system... the ""happy"" days of his violent education are over... but what next ?  What is in his future ?  Isn't everyone promised the American dream???  Sonny walks the straight path, but the odds still seem stacked against him.  It would seem to me that if the film has been understood the viewer should leave it not demanding to know what happened to SONNY himself, but rather wondering about the plight of all the other SONNYs in the world... what society did to create the situation and what society or the communities are failing to do to resolve it ?  Then we must debate whether Sonny's future is really in his own hands and if he does have a fair chance to make a life for himself.  This, I assume was might have been the director's intention.

Though fans of 70s urban action type films will love the music and on-scene locations (and notice a few actors... for example the cop from the MAC and the gang leader from THE WARRIORS) beware, this is not just another 70's urban action thriller... it is an urban coming of Age Story, starting from Sonny's graduation from Jr. HS to his ""education"" (via the streets, the system) and ultimately jail, and his sad graduation into a lonely and questionable adulthood.  Memorable and unique !",1130630400,14,2033,4.650837988826815
1726667,5,B000068TSC,"I love this movie. I bill myself as a hip hop/blackploitation film historian, but forgot about this classic. Only thru reading someone's top 10 movie's for forgotten Movies did I see this title and then ordered this movie. I loved this movie so much that I gave the vhs to a former gang member from Los Angeles (He loved it, and he is passing that around) and I ordered the dvd. I love the director and the real Sonny Carson doing commentary. They tell a grim tell of what the whole filming experience was like. They give you stories of Joe Dancer and the rest that only the directors commentary would provide. Anybody from Chicago over 40,Los Angeles over 40, New York will understand this experience. This is one of my new favorite movies to watch. I love the whole movie from beggining to end. I am 43 years old and see how hip hop, rap, gangsta behavior orginated from this classic. Movies have away of influencing the times. The Education of Sonny Carson has a way of influencing culture. (jocisoo7@aol.com for email me, I would love to have emails from new friends and we can share all of our street movie loves. peace and cheap hair grease. ( I grew up in Robert Taylor Holmes on the south side of chicago and migrated to Long Beach california to exscape gangs and wind up in the heart of west coast gang explosion of the 70's and 80's.",1106006400,24,1343,4.441295546558704
