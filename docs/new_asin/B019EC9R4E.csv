7570500,5,B019EC9R4E,"Do we dismiss a great painting or a piece of music we love because we think it has nothing new to say? Of course not. Because we change, and in each new interaction brings our senses delight. So it is with Forsaken, which brings nothing new to the western dance that has gone on since Liberty Valance and especially Shane. This is the story of John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) coming back from the Civil War ten years too late, bringing nothing except a reputation as a gunfighter and his tortured memories. His dying mother calling his name, his father (Donald Sutherland) the town's reverend, bible black and white, a walking judgment day, and his sweetheart from his youth (Demi Moore) eight years married, with a child and husband. And most importantly, his little brother William dead in a river accident for which John Henry blames himself every day of this life. Nothing new here, except the idea of seeing both the Sutherlands work together is so fine a prospect that it could not be denied. Forsaken is so lovingly made, each frame considered, each line of dialogue heartfelt, the smallest role worried over. It is especially nice to see Donald Sutherland in something substantial, if only to cleanse the palette after The Hunger Games, and he does not wast the opportunity. What is unique about the telling of the story is the pacing. John Henry has put down his guns, like so many before him, but in this case it is more than a gesture of world-weariness, it is an attempt to connect with his father, the Reverend. John Henry undertakes to clear a field in memory of a wish of his dead mother, while the other farmers are methodically intimidated in selling out to a ruthless man assembling sod-buster land by force and intimidation to flip to the coming railroad (Brian Cox, excellent). John Henry pulls stumps and digs holes while his neighbors are beaten and shot, even when he himself is beaten badly in town he does not defend himself. Yet the inevitable looms. Even the bad guys know that judgment is inevitable. There is a very strong scene in the country church where John Henry talks to God. It is more of a one-sided conversation than a prayer. He does not ask for forgiveness, but clarity. Reverend Clayton never lets up on his admonishment to John Henry to not take up his gun against the sinners, that they are for God's judgment, yet finally his love and fear for his son seeps through. In the end, perhaps John Henry has served God's purpose, if not that of his father. Yet his reward is withheld. An existential western. Not new, but a treasured gift. Beautifully shot in Saskatchetoon, Canada. Note: if you enjoyed this, a nice companion piece (if even more brutal) is Mads Mikkelsen's 'The Salvation'. An excellent Danish western.

7570516,5,B019EC9R4E,I grew up in the 1950's when Saturday afternoons matinees at the local theater showed two westerns.  This movie reminded my of those days. 15 minutes into it you can guess what is going happen but its well worth the wait. I loved this movie. The acting was good and the Sutherland's were excellent. The Blu ray version is crisp and clear. If you love the old westerns buy this move - you will not be sorry.,1519257600,,406,4.2727272727272725

7570520,4,B019EC9R4E,"There's nothing in ""Forsaken"" that veteran moviegoers haven't seen before... and that's a good thing. Some 60 years ago, films like ""Forsaken"" filled the bottom half of double features, and it's pretty easy to imagine Randolph Scott or Robert Ryan taking on Kiefer Sutherland's role of the weary gunfighter looking to find peace in his hometown. But Westerns aren't all that popular today, and traditional Westers are even less common. So a movie like ""Forsaken"" which follows a mostly familiar path but does it very well, is some welcome comfort food for viewers.

The main drawing card of ""Forsaken"" is a rare pairing of father and son Donald and Kiefer Sutherland, playing an estranged father and son. Kiefer is John Henry Clayton, an outlaw and gunfighter returning to his Wyoming hometown after many years following the death of his mother. John Henry wants to reform, but his preacher father Samuel (Donald) is still bitter about his sons lifestyle. And John Henry picked a particularly bad time to come home, since the local land baron McCurdy (Brian Cox), aided by a number of hired gunmen, is strong arming the local farmers into selling out to him. McCurdy is understandably leery of John Henrys presence and has his own top gunslinger, Dave Turner (Michael Wincott) on hand to deal with John Henry if he has to.

Based on this description alone, most viewers can pretty much guess how Forsaken is going to turn out. The bad guys turn up the pressure on John Henry, hoping he will do something that allows them to gun him down, while Samuel doubts the sincerity of his sons long delayed repentance. What makes the movie work, however, is the excellence of the acting that overcomes some of the predictable elements in the story. Kiefer and Donald have excellent chemistry together, so much so that viewers realize its a shame theyve worked together so seldom. Watching Kiefer exercise restraint in situations in which the audience knows hes sorely tempted to dish out some Jack Bauer-styled justice is a delight.

The real find in Forsaken, however, isn't either Sutherland or the always reliable Brian Cox in a tailor-made role. Its the too seldom seen Michael Wincott, who plays a gunslinger who knows quite well what John Henry is going through and has a great deal of respect for him as a man and a healthy respect for his ability with a gun, a talent that Dave Turner would rather not see put to use. Unlike Turner, the rest of McCreadys goons are a bunch of sadistic hotheads just itching for a slapdown and completely unaware of how dangerous John Henry is. Wincott gives Turner a courtly sense of style, turning him into a likable antagonist, and its clear hes the only person in the movie who really understands John Henry.

Fans of Western action will get their fill in Forsaken, because when the shooting does start, director Jon Cassar (who helmed a number of episodes of 24) manages to stage the action scenes with some flair, so that they don't play out in a predictable manner. And, of course, Kiefer Sutherland has few rivals in intense realism in action sequences. Fans of Western scenery will also get their fill as well, as Cassar takes full advantage of the Canadian scenery that does a more than adequate job of filling in for Wyoming.

Forsaken does manage to tweak its familiar formula in a couple of ways, including the addition of Demi Moore as John Henrys love interest he left behind. She turns out not to be a pining spinster, but a married woman whose husband has some rather mixed feelings about John Henry returning, a dynamic that the villainous McCurdy is able to use to his advantage. Its these little variations on the typical formula, combined with the solid acting, that give Forsaken that little extra edge that keeps it from just being routine.

Forsaken isn't a groundbreaking Western, but its solid, enjoyable viewing that shoots straight with the audience and provides equal measures of excitement and drama. It also offers the rare sight of both Sutherlands in the same movie in substantial roles. Viewers should not forsake this film if they are looking for a solid evenings entertainment.",1514764800,2,4143,4.828169014084507

7570531,5,B019EC9R4E,"An overlooked gem in the Western genre although admittedly film dealing with a familiar theme of a man coming back to his home town and reluctantly talking on the forces of evil. Kiefer Sutherland never better, even though I was a devoted 24 fan of his. The later scene between him and his fictional/real life father, Donald Sutherland, in which they air their grievances and true feelings is very poignant. Demi Moore, often the subject of ridicule or dismissiveness, puts in a very strong performance as the woman Kiefer Sutherland's character left behind. She gets a rare opportunity to showcase her acting talents. I was a bit disappointed by the ending but otherwise very pleased with this wonderful film",1503878400,,709,4.966386554621849

7570554,4,B019EC9R4E,"Well done western movie.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it isn't a revolutionary plot or movie, but it doesn't have to be to entertain.  The plot if about John Henry (Younger Sutherland), a veteran of the civil war and gunslinger who comes home to his father's house (Older Sutherland) to try an change his ways.  Off course trouble in the town draws him back into his old habits, as is expected in these types of stories.  But the acting in this movie makes it memorable despite the formulaic plot.  The two Sutherlands do a great job, and work very well together.  Donald especially shows why he is one of those legendary actors.  Brian Cox shows up as the villain, and nails it as he always does.  Demi Moore has a solid role as John Henry's ex-flame, and Michael Wincott gives a very good performance as the villain's conflicted lead gunman.  His role is limited but adds a lot of depth the the film. Like many westerns this is a slow-build movie than simmers until a final explosion of violence.  About the only noticeable shortcoming I find was that the climax felt a bit short given the build-up.  But still a good western and fine display of acting from the main cast.",1494979200,,1183,4.533018867924528

7570557,5,B019EC9R4E,"This was a movie I happened upon and I'm now wondering why it didn't get more promotion.  The story is a cliche...the gunslinger who's given up killing and returned home only to be drawn into against a fight between farmers and dirty-dealing businessmen (in this case a saloon owner buying up land before the expected railroad comes through) and all the characters are cliches as well...the sweetheart he left behind, the embittered father wondering where he went wrong, the gun-crazed henchmen, the hired gun whom we know will end up in the climactic gunfight, but...  It's the way these characters and the situation are portrayed that takes it above the usual plotline.

One could see Eastwood and son Scott in the roles Kiefer Sutherland and his father portray but here it's played with a low-keyed intensity. Sutherland's John Henry is a remorseful man, filled with grief because of the killings he has committed after the war ended. Discovering his ability to use a gun, he explains, ""The war left me but I didn't leave the war."" In one scene he actually breaks down and cries over his crimes.  When the last time anyone saw a gunslinger cry? After accidentally killing a child in a gunfight, he's hung up his guns and only wants to come home.

Of course it doesn't turn out that way and we can see the end coming a mile off but the inevitable face-off in the street turns out not as the audience expects, though the ending is.

The dialogue in this movie is another surprise.  Similar to that in True Grit, the actors declaim rather than speaking, as if they were delivering lines from Shakespeare, with three and four-letter words and perfect diction, making one wonder if those in the Old West actually did speak that way.

Shining in a cast of mostly unknowns is Michael Wincott as ""Gentleman Dave,"" John Henry's opposite number in the enemy camp.  Impeccably attired, with flawless diction delivered in a deep Southern accent, his voice alone should earn him villain roles.  Between his voice and Sutherland's whispery dialogue, one gets chills.  Donald Sutherland, looking almost like John Brown with that full white hair and beard, is perfect as the preacher father, and Kiefer Sutherland delivers a fine performance as the weary, I-only-want-to-be-left-alone John Henry.

It's a good movie, and an entertaining one. Violent, to be sure, but after all, it is the Old West. There are also some glimpses of beautiful scenery from Alberta where this was filmed.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1494547200,,2573,4.84703196347032

This film respects and elevates the Western genre. The Sutherlands are typically superb (Kiefer taking his brooding ""24"" persona into a Western, Donald appropriately patriarchal, both in his beliefs and disappointments (and, ultimately, his love)). It would be all but impossible to steal the show from this powerful father and son pairing, but Michael Wincott comes close as Dave Turner, the gunslinger whose seemingly unavoidable intersection with (Kiefer) Sutherland's John Henry Clayton is the film's intriguing subtext. His gravitas as a complex ""gentleman assassin,"" possessed of sense of honor and perfect diction, commands attention whenever he graces a scene. While he alone is worth the watch, the entire ensemble delivers a rewarding and captivating homage to the American Western.""",1493510400,,932,5.524475524475524

7570651,1,B019EC9R4E,"This could have been a good movie, but the writing and Kiefer Sutherland's acting did it in.  Kiefer seemed as if he was reading his lones for the first time off a script deliberately doing it in a monotone.  Micheal Wincott and Donald Sutherland are good in their roles but alas could not save this dreadful film.",1484697600,,314,4.491228070175438
7570652,4,B019EC9R4E,"The strength of Forsaken relies heavily on the fact it stars Kiefer Sutherland and his father Donald Sutherland.  How many of us have always wanted to see this amazing father and son combo appear together in a movie?  I know I have.  Now we have it!  I remember an interview with Kiefer on Jay Leno one time where he mentioned he hardly ever sees his father since they both work long hours.  They both work hard too.  Plus the scripts the two star in never seem to match up.  They're both covering different territory.

Anyway Forsaken is a western.  Yup, Kiefer stars in a western this time.  When the movie begins we see Kiefer coming home riding a horse.  Donald storms out of the house angry and says ""Your mother is dead"".  Wow, welcome home son!  The impression here is that Donald and Kiefer are going to be enemies.  At least that's what I thought.  Instead Donald is simply angry that Kiefer -who has his own rebellious side and apparently is an incredibly skilled gunslinger- disappeared for 10 years while his mom worried sick about him.  She died upset (in Donald's arms apparently) that Kiefer never came home.  Yup, I can see why Donald would be upset.

Gradually Donald and Kiefer begin to open up and talk as Kiefer takes a particular interest working in the fields, cutting down trees and making a huge garden since apparently this is what Kiefer's mother always wanted (even though Donald disagrees).  Meanwhile Demi Moore comes around on a horse one day as Kiefer's working out there.  She had a thing for Kiefer, but since he disappeared for 10 years she went and married another man in town.  How skanky Demi!  Just kidding, 10 years is a long time.  I gotta say both Kiefer and Demi feel awkward playing in a western.  It's an enjoyable movie don't get me wrong, but looking back these two were awkward choices for the role based on their contributions to other films, so watching Demi and Kiefer get caught up on what's going on with their lives and what's happening in town was a bit weird to say the least.

Anyway there's a gang of thugs in town.  They take exception to Kiefer's return.  A businessman (Brian Cox) demands that Demi Moore and her husband leave town immediately or else.  Yup, or else they get shot and killed.  Hey this is a western- I didn't expect the ""or else"" to be a pat on the back!  He even offers them money to leave.  How generous!  Of course this is where Kiefer steps in.  At first the thugs kick the heck out of Kiefer after making him clean up a mess of spilled liquor one of the men deliberately made on the floor.  Kiefer even cleans the guy's boots (but if you look closely he's actually smearing the mess on the man's boots and making it worse due to handling the rag the wrong way!)

The movie is really light and quiet for the most part.  Light on the storytelling, and quiet in the way the characters go about their business and communicate with each other.  However the parts that are violent are *really* bloody so be prepared for that.  Watching Kiefer get kicked around by those thugs is quite the surprise.  I'm still in Jack Bauer mode I guess!  I expect Kiefer to respond with aggression, win the fight and save another day!  He doesn't though (at least not at first).  It's when the thugs decide to push Donald around, that's when Kiefer says enough is enough.

Boy, the sad moment when Kiefer's sitting with Donald in church, and Kiefer mentions he killed two men and accidentally killed a little boy when a bullet went the wrong way inside a store window (which explains the opening scene).  Kiefer breaks down and it's a REALLY touching moment.  Perhaps this movie should have included a few more moments like these to make it better.  Still a quality movie but the characters are a little undeveloped.  Again they're usually quiet but when Kiefer or Donald in particular speak to each other about their feelings, they have your attention then.  So the movie's solid enough.  It just could have been so much more.

At least watching Kiefer walk into the bar and go ballistic on the thugs is a thing of amazement.  They so deserved it.  What kind of horrible people go around the countryside and kill people in their homes?  Someone had to stand up to this!  Great job Kiefer.  Oh and the movie actually feels like a western which is nice.  No Hollywood special effects or anything like that.

The characters are all really good, even if some of them feel out of place like Demi Moore.  Brian Cox being a strict businessman is a perfect role for him, and Michael Wincott's mysterious character who seemingly fights on the bad side and almost has a showdown with Kiefer but recognizes the wrong ways of the thugs is also enjoyable.  Even though the movie takes place 10 years after the Civil War, it doesn't mention anything related to the war.  Not that I really expected it too.  I assume this movie is fictional but can't say for sure.  Who knows, maybe it's  loosely based on real events.

7570827,5,B019EC9R4E,"Released in 2015 and directed by Jon Cassar, ""Forsaken"" is a Western starring Kiefer Sutherland as a repentant prodigal son who returns to his hometown in the Northwest after going off to fight the Civil War and afterward morphing into a notorious gunfighter. His mother's now passed away and his father, the town preacher (Donald Sutherland), has a hard time embracing him. Demi Moore plays his youthful flame, now married (the husband played by Jonny Rees). Brian Cox is on hand as the land-grabbing villain with his hired guns (Aaron Poole and Dylan Smith). Michael Wincott stands out as the southern Gentleman Dave, an honorable gunfighter.

This is a nigh excellent realistic Western even though parts are too by-the-numbers and it clearly borrows from past Westerns, like the towering ""Shane"" and ""Unforgiven."" But it's different enough to stand on its own and holds some agreeable surprises up its sleeve.

I like the subplot about the Civil War causing John Henry (Kiefer) to become disillusioned, falling into the gunfighting lifestyle. Kiefer is unexpectedly good as the protagonist, easily carrying the movie with the help of his father; the church sequence is particularly effective. I also appreciate the message with the romantic subplot, which is the antithesis of the eye-rolling events in ""Pale Rider,"" a film that borrowed even heavier from ""Shane"" and could be called a total rip-off (or homage). I thought I had the ending figured out, but I was wrong, which is good.

The movie runs 90 minutes and was shot in CL Ranch, Springbank, Alberta, Canada.

GRADE: Borderline A-/B+

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY *** SPOILER ALERT ***

Someone criticized ""Forsaken"" on the grounds that it was a ""low-budget Pale Rider,"" But there are significant differences between the two movies:

John Henry (Kiefer) in ""Forsaken"" is a human being rather than a mysterious supernatural figure like the Preacher (Eastwood) in ""Pale Rider.""

John Henry served during the Civil War, clearly suffering PTSS and swearing off killing whereas the Preacher appears as a sort of angel of vengeance with zero qualms about killing those who deserve it.

John Henry humbles himself, allowing himself to get his axx kicked, whereas the Preacher is superhuman, always kicking axx from the get-go.

As a human being, John Henry repents in tears in the church facility, hugged by his father, whereas the Preacher needs to do no such thing.

John Henry loved the woman (Mary Alice) enough to not mess with her in any way and thus risk destroying her family whereas the Preacher has sex with the woman even though her kindly husband, Hull, is his friend and he's supposed to be an agent of righteousness (!), which is a gaping plot hole.

John Henry doesn't want to take on Gentleman Dave, if he doesn't have to, likely because they're birds of a feather and he recognizes Dave's code of honor, unlike the other scumbag thugs hired by McMurdy. He also mercifully allows the young hirelings the chance to leave the gunfight. By contrast, the Preacher basically kills everyone linked to the villain without mercy.

""Forsaken"" is real-life dramatic Western whereas ""Pale Rider"" is a mythical Western with supernatural elements.",1478995200,,3197,5.066666666666666

The whole picture as far as set, music, color, and acting is above par for what has been a forgotten genre. It brings memory of the Unforgiven  to mind not that it is as good as that.  It stands alone as solid Western.  I liked the relationship of John Henry and Gentleman Jack. It was a mature relationship that was subtle and truthful. As for the final gunfight, it stands out as realistic and the final part is humorous. This not a time waster and deserves a look if you like Westerns",1478908800,,586,4.15929203539823

I agree with everyone - those who thought this was a very good, if clichd, western; and those who thought it could have been much better. They're both right.

The overall theme is as well worn as a cowboy's chaps: a helpless town oppressed and intimidated by a sinister land grabber and his greasy gunman; and a reformed, but tormented former gunslinger who is their only hope, but resists his old life and the way of the gun. Sound familiar?

This movie was made on the cheap. It could have used more depth and development, and the ending comes on quick, but it has a moving soundtrack, respectable cinematography, hits a strong sentimental note, and gives homage to westerns of the past.

If you like westerns, this is not Lonesome Dove, but it's well worth a watch. I had low expectations going in, but was pleasantly surprised.

7570955,5,B019EC9R4E,"Subtle for such a spectacular movie and maybe that's what makes it so memorable. The failure to advertise this movie was a real mistake and I suspect cost them all a great deal of money in the long run because of their short sighted ness. It was not in theaters long at all!  Kiefer Sutherland was flawless and inspiring in his portrayal of the son who's preacher father (Donald Sutherland) never communicated the love he had for him, just judgment, until he was the one who finally understood what a preacher should have understood long before. I was delighted to see Demi More in this film. Her acting has been a real work in progress since her General Hospital days and being out of the spotlight has given her a chance to mature into a really serious actress to contend with. As long as she continues to play and act her age and put more into her acting than her men, I see some really good opportunities ahead for her. A 20 y.o. with a grey wig just isn't the same, though she did look quite well taken care of for her age.  Demi Moore was right on the money as a quietly strong wife with a good man  she married after waiting futilely  for John Henry to return from war. Given the life span, and the natural pull to have a family, at that time two years was pretty generous... but as in matters of the heart there are no rules and it was obvious she still had feelings for him that motivated her husband to behave stupidly, not communicating his plans for their life and ordering her around to try and establish dominance. Not many equal partnerships in marriage and he made a decision without consulting her or any others that triggered the series of events that were probably common for the time. While the father/son relationship, better late than never, was uncomfortable from the beginning it was a shame their connection didn't really happen until the end. It took so long for the father to grow up, that the film missed a real golden opportunity to take advantage of the casting. Brian Cox was wonderful in the strong type of part he does to perfection. He plays a land grabber knowing the railroad will pay dearly for the flat farm land.  He hired men with guns and not much else. The funniest part was hired swaggering, insecure, dirty boy with an obviously outsized ego who was most insulted that John Henry hadn't heard of him. After all, he had "" killed FOUR people !""  This boy's huge ego and stupidity was a factor in waking up the town's sheep with disgust if nothing else. The most interesting relationship was  between John Henry and a hired gunslinger (for the bad guy). It was quite reminiscent of Val Kilmer's memorable portrayal of  Doc Holiday in Tombstone and Johnny Ringo. A sort of ethical, civil,  respectful and honorable relationship between  killers. For the one, it was clearly just a temporary security job. As it was clear they knew each other, that would be interesting to follow up. I can't say enough about Kiefer Sutherland's performance. It was spot on and compelling as he inhabited the very skin and mind of  the character. Bringing John to life in a thoughtful way.  He and I are probably the only two people on the planet who haven't seen 24, his acting is always so thoughtful that maybe I've just been saving it for a treat. Like his father, he doesn't seem to enjoy lighter fare, but I've always loved his little foray into the pool of fun with Dennis Hopper where he played an FBI agent transporting a famous and elusive old ""Most Wanted"" hippie radical (SDS or Weathermen).  It was called The Trip or 1969 or something like that.  I still recall it vividly and watch it when I find it. (should buy it). But it's the only non-serious role I recall him playing and one of the few Dennis Hopper films I liked. This film is definitely a film that brought out the best in every actor.  They are generous to each other in this production which makes the cohesion and timing perfect. Not one dull or slow moment. The script was so good that there was no need to cover it up with unnecessary blood and guts or painfully slow and ""artistic"" hours of blood and guts.  Luckily it's rented for 72 hours so I can watch it again many times. I really would like to see a film following the low key life of this former gunman. I'd like to see how a secretly former gunman has a life, family, vocation after leaving the ""wild West"".",1475971200,,4367,4.460476787954831

The story has epic and mythic qualities so that like a familiar story viewers can take pleasure seeing how the film-maker and the actors recreate it. Forsaken is a great watch for a broader audience. It isn't as brutal or as explicit as other westerns, such as, Pale Rider and High Plains Drifter where the violence is confronting and the main protagonist is more ambivalent than in this film. The line between good and evil is clearly drawn in this film with one exception.

It's also the first (and only at the time of this review) movie they've been in together.  Fans of either of these actors probably will want to check this one out for that reason alone, but for an overall story or entertaining movie, Forsaken offers nothing.  Remember when you were in primary school and had to write stories then, the next day they'd get passed around and you had to read other kids stories, and there would always be one or two kids who couldn't think up an original idea themselves and just rewrote the plot of whatever movie they'd seen recently.  Well that's what the writers of Forsaken have done.  They've obviously gone to the DVD store, rented some Westerns, maybe a few modern day ex con gets out of jail and wants to live right films too and just rehashed the plots.  An ageing cowboy returns home to his parent's farm/ranch to discover one of his parents is dead and the other not liking his chosen path in life is real crabby to him but reluctantly lets him stay.  The cowboy doesn't want to be the man he used to be and has sworn his killing days are a thing of the past. The parent doesn't believe them but wants to and starts to as the film goes on.  Of course there are some bad guy thugs being bossed around  by a rich guy who wants the land of those afraid to stand up to him.  They aren't smart enough to just leave the cowboy alone but decide to torment him and make it personal by attacking those he cares about.

You know how this one is going to play out when it begins if the writers don't add anything original themselves.  They don't. Even the reason why he has given up carrying a gun is the used most often one.  Maybe even if they had come up with an original way for a guy who doesn't carry guns to save the town or kill the bad guys where he could have gone, ""see dad I told you I'd never pick up a gun again, and I kept my word"", you could have had that, but the script writers were even too lazy to do that.

The only thing unique the movie sort of has done is completely cast an older cast of actors (other than the odd child extra).  The norm of young actors isn't used here.  Kiefer, Demi Moore and the other actors you've probably never seen before are all old enough they probably don't have a lot of roles offered to them.  Wether this is realistic for how long people lived until back in those days is probably another story.  I wouldn't be surprised if  the grave at the end of the film wasn't there due to dying of old age for the era.",1474156800,,2629,4.192842942345925
7571180,5,B019EC9R4E,"Five MALEVOLENT Stars. ""Forsaken"" (2015) at first glance has the usual classic Western plot where the rich man in the town of Fowler is buying off the individual land owners amid threats of violence if they refused, but there are deep intertwined layers to the back stories of many characters. Kiefer Suthertland stars as John Henry Clayton, a former Civil War soldier who is trying to get past a decade-long reputation for violence and he carries two secrets. His father is the town preacher, played by Donald Sutherland and father and son share some outstanding scenes together in this excellent Western. Also starring Michael Wincott in a great turn as ""Gentleman Dave"", Brian Cox, Aaron Poole, and Demi Moore in her own superb role. Directed by Jon Cassar. Highly Recommended. Five VENGEFUL Stars.

He is trying to get along with his dad who is a minister. A gunslinger and a minister in the same home? Ouch. However, he finds out that his home town is in trouble from crooked corporations out to run people off their land in order to build a new railroad through there.

7571222,4,B019EC9R4E,"This movie is a good throw-back to the old time westerns of the past.  Gunfighter running from his past, and returns home to visit his father. However, there are some bad guys in town who are trying to force people off their farms.  And, the gunfighter needs to determine whether he is going to get involved or look the other way.

What complicates the movie is that the gunfighter's father is a religious preacher who preaches against violence and criticizes his son for his past life.  The gunfighter is Kiefer Sutherland.  His father is, his father, Donald Sutherland.

As in other movies that I have seen starring him, Kiefer's acting is uneven.  Even worse is the acting of Demi Moore.  Donald Sutherland is excellent as always.

At the climax of the movie, the obligatory gun fight scene, however, Kiefer is excellent, as in his acting in 24, he performs the role of a man involved in a violent situation very well.  In fact, to me, this is one of the best gun fights that I have ever seen, and I have watched a number of times.  For this scene alone, I recommend watching the rest of the movie, because it leads up to the scene and you need to understand background and context.",1473379200,,1185,4.516431924882629

7571264,4,B019EC9R4E,"John Henry Clayton, a gunman, returns home to the town of Fowler, Wyoming, hoping to hang up his guns and put his killing days behind him.  He finds his mother in the family graveyard, an old flame married to another man, and an uncertain welcome from his embittered preacher father. He also finds a town under siege from a ruthless developer, anxious to own it all before the railroad arrives.

If this sounds like familiar territory, it is.  What makes ""Forsaken"" stand out is the combined talents of Kiefer Sutherland and his father Donald, and a plot that doesn't quite play out to expectations.  The Sutherlands are terrific together, working out a lifetime of anger and disappointed expectations across the dinner table, in a field, in a church, and in the streets of Fowler.  Demi Moore plays the old flame, caught between the past and an uncertain future.  Brian Cox is the ruthless developer, turning his gunmen loose on the towns people.  Michael Wincott has a notably subtle and interesting role as a hired gun who knows John Henry from another lifetime.

The movie was shot in Alberta Province, Canada, and the scenery is stunning.  The sets are authentic, the dialogue is measured and austere, and the plot offers little shelter for the squeamish.  Well recommended as a surprisingly solid movie that got overlooked in its theatrical release.",1472342400,11,1355,4.9035087719298245

7571268,5,B019EC9R4E,"I really liked this Western for its tight scripting, great acting and directing.  All in all, a good story that resolves conflict in a family situation to getting the bad guys and bringing about justice.  You feel satisfied at the end of the story, yet sad that Keifer Sutherland's character doesn't get to just settle down like he wanted to and stay home to live out a life of peace with his Dad with whom he's reconciled.  But the protagonist is a hero, and he does come back often on the quiet to see his Dad before he dies, whereupon the he doesn't come home again.

But I must say it is one of the old western classics that's made with depth.  You cry, you laugh, the emotions I felt ran the gamut....  it was so nice to watch a modern movie with all the attributes of a good ole western again.  The lagniappe was having Donald and Kiefer Sutherland, real life father and son, playing father and son in the movie with Demi Moore in the female role.  All of the actors in this movie did a bang-up job.  The morals that old movies seemed to adhere to are also in this one.  Just refreshing.  As Kiefer Sutherland said in the 'extras' .... the old western was always the black hat against the white hat and today life seems to not be so black and white... that is very true... although we seemingly have gone too far away from the 'black and white' mentality...... just my personal take.",1470873600,,937,4.278409090909091

7571582,4,B019EC9R4E,"Kiefer Sutherland and the director John Cassar discussed making an ""old-fashioned Western"" while they were working on the TV series ""24,"" and ""Forsaken"" is the very enjoyable result.  Western fans will recognize allusions and parallels to ""Shane,"" to some of Eastwood's religiously-inflected Westerns, and even to things like ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" in which the railroad figures as a malign force that threatens the livings of small farmers.  But it's not just an empty recapitulation of a once-vibrant form.  John Henry Clayton is indeed a gunslinger trying to get away from his violent past, but the screenplay here gives him a compelling backstory, that includes the Civil War and its bloodiest battles (Shiloh, for one), and a penchant for violence thereafter that he is not shocked out of until his violence leads to a tragic accident.  That sends him back home after ten years, to find his mother dead, his beloved Mary Alice (Demi Moore) married to another, and his father, William (Donald Sutherland), a preacher, unwilling to believe anything good about him.  We also get some even earlier backstory about his family that plays into the mutual tension between father and son.  All of this is beautifully and naturally woven into a narrative of a ""present"" in which the local saloon owner James McCurdy (Brian Cox) has hired some gunslingers to ""persuade"" local farmers to sell their land to him, so that he can reap a huge profit when the railroad comes through and wants to buy that land.  The issue is -- how will John Henry react to the violence of the gunslingers, some of which is directed at him and his father.  His father, of course, won't countenance his son making a violent response to the beatings and murders that McCurdy's men feel free to inflict.  Interestingly, McCurdy's lieutenant is ""Gentleman"" Dave Turner, also a Civil War veteran who knows of John Henry and whose reputation John Henry, in turn, is aware of.  The interplay between the two gunslingers is interesting, especially since Dave is unable to control some of the other gunslingers that McCurdy has hired.  Suffice it to say only -- in the interest of avoiding spoilers -- that he's not called ""Gentleman"" for nothing.  Be assured, though, that there comes a time when John Henry goes into the barn, retrieves his gun-belt from under the straw, and straps it on . . .

The film is beautifully shot (in Canada, standing in for the frontier), and written with a formality that gives it pungency without seeming quite as arch as the writing of ""True Grit.""  The Sutherlands work very well together, Cox fills out the standard bad guy portrait, Michael Wincott is an unusual Gentleman Dave (a touch of Doc Holliday, maybe), and Demi Moore is a very credible and appealing Mary Alice, playing to her age convincingly.  The other gunslingers are the standard scum of the earth that we love to hate, and the whole thing drives to a very satisfying conclusion.",1466553600,,2952,4.852589641434263

Made all the more ridiculous by the fact that mean ole Kiefer is apparently about 4'2"" tall next to his dad and would have to look up at Tom Cruise's knees-ooooohhhhh scary lil gunslinger.
HOLY CRAP Jack Schaefer's estate still must have copyright on ""Shane,"" right? This is the most shameless, derivative, paint-by-numbers ripoff of that classic novella and film imaginable.
Remember Demi Moore?  Ha, you'l wish you hadn't when she pops up here.  At least Sutherland senior USED to be an actor.  She and Junior are classic examples of has-been ""stars"" who couldn't act their way out of a burlap bag in a sasparilly shop.

Nothing new happens until end, which redeems (no pun intended) it all to ""average"" level.

This film really tests that old line about ""I'd watch _____ (Robert DeNiro, Gene Hackman ... now Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce) make compost/sing show tunes/drink a Big Gulp ... "" This movie pushes that sentiment to breaking, tosses a couple dozen more sentiments in for seasoning, and ends up trying the patience mightily.

Basic, basic, basic Western that includes the limited and limiting talents of Demi Moore and the glorious scowling rasping honorable bad gunman  hence, three stars, average, ""It's okay"" as Amazon says.

And Hollywood still has no idea how people who go to church actually talk. At one point Donald Sutherland's pastor recites three random verses in a row as if they were the tail end of a sermon. That's now how it's done  and a supposedly all hardcore preacher would not do that, let alone one on the late-19th century American prairie.

Demi Moore as the long lost love was perfect.  She definitely needs to be in more movies.  (She's still hot) Michael Wincott is one of my most favorite bad guys. I just wish there were more scenes with him.  Finally, Brian Cox always has that ""I'm the man"" persona.  Great choice for that part.

Lots of conflict in this story, which keeps every interaction tense.  Physical, emotional, personal struggles galore mesh with the coming of evil men.  Pretty soon this one poor soul is FORCED to do what he never wanted to do again: KILL.

You will understand why he has no desire to kill, and it makes you feel the man's turmoil as he brings it to the bad guys.  I loved the thoughtful, steady pacing of the film.  Realistic--and often broken--relationships.  Simple lives in trouble.  A hero must rise.

Not to mention the extremely odd casting choices. Paring Kiefer Sutherland with his father Donald Sutherland might seem like a cool idea, you'd think they'd play well on screen. Except that they have COMPLETELY different acting styles which makes every interaction of theirs painful. Again, this is mostly the script's fault as it could have been written in a way that bought out both of their strengths on screen.

Kiefer Sutherland does a fine job as the son who went to war and never came home until years had past.  His scene with his reverend father in the church had me in tears - both times I watched it.  Donald has never been better.  And Demi Moore did a fantastic job!  Never more beautiful to me, even without the makeup.  (I'm sure there was some, but still...)  She was so believable in the role that she almost put the others to shame.  Brian Cox overacted marvelously.  And, as another reviewer pointed out, Michael Wincott practically stole the movie as Gentleman Dave.  Even his over voiced epilogue at the end of the film was beautifully done.  Best acting he's done, in my opinion (and he's done some brilliant acting).
Great acting, great direction (when the acting is so universally good, it's the sign of a great director), great production, an excellent western.

that it became a habit, he turned into a feared gunfighter not returning home, however, there was one gunfight
that was set to haunt him for the rest of his days leading to him hanging-up his guns, hopefully for good.
Ten years has past since seeing his hometown last, returning home he would find many changes, his mother
had passed on, his lover 'Mary-Alice' (Demi Moore) who had waited four years for his return was now married
and has a six-year old son.
When parting the town all those years ago things were fraught between him and his 'preacher' father 'William'
(Donald Sutherland) trying to rebuild a relationship his aim.
The town isn't the sleepy place he remembers, these are troubled times for the small-land-owners, the bar-owner
'James McCurdy' (Brian Cox) with the help of his henchmen led by the ruthless 'Frank Tillman' (Aaron Poole)
is by any means possible buying up the homesteads.
'McCurdy' has additional insurance having also hired renowned gunman 'Gentleman Dave Turner' (Michael Wincott)
the towns sheriff long since departed from the scene, the homesteaders need help.
However, 'John Henry' is determined it won't be him, despite provocation from 'McCurdy's' henchmen he turns the
other cheek time after time to honour his fathers wishes, however the henchmen will step-over the line forcing
'John Henry' to again wear his gun.....will there be a showdown between him and hired gunman 'Gentleman Dave' ?
For me, this is good old-style Western action, thoroughly enjoyed it.

As such, this is a taut gritty good ole Western that is not long and drawn out like some of the classics. At just under 90 minutes long, it's short and sweet, while still being subtle and heartbreaking, emotionally charged, and biting you in it's grips at just the right moments.

I agree with other reviewers in saying that the chemistry between father and son is incredible. These two are amazing actors, and after watching them in this movie, you wonder why they didn't perform in more Westerns. Maybe this is a wake up call. Here's hoping they come out with another.

I also want to mention how beautiful this movie is. The pacing is perfect. The scenery is gorgeous. Sepia tones and deep greens mix with dark evening scenes and quiet mornings. A thrill to watch. My 80 year old father loved it. And so did I.",1459814400,,1217,4.352422907488987

7572218,4,B019EC9R4E,"Just watched the new western FORSAKEN -- an admirably spare and unpretentious story with a solid, traditional-western feel. Strong cast (led by Kiefer and Donald Sutherland as estranged son and father), decent writing, well-produced. There were few plot surprises (though there is a nice twist involving a gentleman hired gun), and there is violence -- but it's not gratuitous or excessively graphic, just enough to make the point. When too many period movies (like THE REVENANT, DJANGO UNCHAINED, BONE TOMAHAWK and HATEFUL EIGHT) revel in bloody graphic brutality far exceeding what's needed to tell a story, director Jon Cassar's refreshing restraint is appreciated! The biggest flaws would be 1-dimensional villains and a lack of humor, but it's less grim than many recent westerns. Western fans won't be sorry to spend 90 minutes watching this one.",1459728000,,852,5.318518518518519

To see the struggles of their relationship come to understanding they did absolutely well together. I love the fact that this is a wonderful western movie too, something you don't see much of now a days. I wish you could see more of them on the big screen but it seems if the the movie isn't about super hero comics, scripted reality, or without the lower moral standards of today it isn't worth it to most.

The movies kind of takes a bit of all the old stand by westerns in roll them into one movie. The movie is about a gunfighter that is tired of killing so he goes home. He hasn't been back in years. he left to go fight the war and didn't come back afterwards leaving his parents and the woman (Demi Moore)  he loved behind. When he gets home he finds his mother has died and his old girlfriend married someone else. His father is a minister and as you can imagine didn't approve of his life choices. Then they are the typical bad guy that run the town and are trying to run the people off their ranches. The movie is nothing ground breaking as far as westerns but it very well done for a low budget film. If you like westerns you won't be disappointed.,1459296000,,845,4.177914110429448

It's a standard ""western"" story structure, but that's part of what we go to see in works like this. Flaws include a somewhat redundant musical score (although the music is good and quite atmospheric, certain themes are overused), and villains that are too predicatably stereotypical and a bit hyperbolic (some more interesting character development would have been wecome here).

One great thing to see was the wide panoramic shots that were so common in old westerns but are rare today where directors seem to use only close up camera work.
This film borrows very heavily from movies like Unforgiven ..... but again, because Forsaken pays such a homage and tribute to older style westerns, I was happy to see it and buy it on DVD

7572473,3,B019EC9R4E,"It seems like good western movies are getting rare these days as there are fewer and fewer big budget productions of them these days, which is a shame as I like the genre of movies, especially when there is a decent story.  Although I wouldnt say that Forsaken in the category as Unforgiven which is my favorite western of the last couple of decades, Forsaken is a decent watch.  There is good father/son chemistry between the Sutherlands and really believable raw emotion from the two.  The story itself isn't terribly original as it sticks to a well-traveled formula that has been explored many times before in westerns of the past and is very predictable in its conclusion.  It also is a bit slow moving at times and takes a bit too long to build up to the climatic confrontation and unfortunately a rather quick conclusion to the gun battle.  Is this a ground breaking movie in the genre? No, but it is a decent entertaining western movie to watch in what is unfortunately a genre that is becoming less popular for Hollywood to make or at least make well (with the exception of maybe Django) in the last few years.

The acting is solid and watching the Sutherland father-son dynamic play out is as fun as it is compelling. The action is tight and by the climax, you're thirsty for some six gun satisfaction, which it delivers. What's more it comes in at an old-school length of 90 minutes.

7572780,5,B019EC9R4E,"I happened on this movie while trolling for something to watch on pay-per-view.  What a lucky and enthralling find.  This film respects and elevates the Western genre.  The Sutherlands are typically superb (Kiefer taking his brooding ""24"" persona into a Western, Donald appropriately patriarchal, both in his beliefs and disappointments (and, ultimately, his love)).  It would be all but impossible to steal the show from this powerful father and son pairing, but Michael Wincott comes close as Dave Turner, the gunslinger whose seemingly unavoidable intersection with (Kiefer) Sutherland's John Henry Clayton is the film's intriguing subtext. His gravitas as a complex ""gentleman assassin,"" possessed of sense of honor and perfect diction, commands attention whenever he graces a scene.  While he alone is worth the watch, the entire ensemble delivers a rewarding and captivating homage to the American Western.",1456617600,92,912,5.579710144927536

7572785,4,B019EC9R4E,"John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) returns to his western home sometime after the Civil War. He discovers Donald Sutherland (Rev. Clayton) is still alive and doing films while his mother has died. Rev. Clayton does everything he can to make his son feel unwanted, but to no avail, he stays. We then discover some bad guys are forcing the ranchers to sell their land. We don't know why, but this is a theme of half the western films out there, normally involving either the railroad or goldmine. John Henry has an old girlfriend (Demi Moore) that has moved on without him. If you have ever seen a western before you got a pretty good idea what happens...even the lines got to be predictable.

In spite of this being identical to so many westerns and Donald Sutherland pontificates in too many scenes, the film was done well for fans of the genre. Keifer gives us one fine emotional scene in the church and I liked the original title ""Redemption"" a bit better.

7572850,2,B019EC9R4E,"Well acted but mostly tedious western about a gunslinger named John Henry Clayton (Keifer Sutherland) who returns home after putting down his guns and forsaking violence, trying to reconcile with his stern preacher father (Donald Sutherland) who strongly disapproves of the life his son led after the war.  Meanwhile, a local land baron (Brion Cox) is using violence and even murder to buy up properties in the area since the railroad is coming to town.  There is no sheriff (whether he  was killed or fled the movie never makes clear) and the townspeople can't fight off the land baron's hired guns--do you think John Henry's vow to give up violence is going to make it all the way to the end credits?

It's nice to see Keifer and Donald Sutherland on screen together and they are both pretty good, as is the rest of the cast.  But Forsaken's drama never really clicks--not the father/son stuff, not the land grab story--so the movie is mostly just dull as we wait for the moment when John Henry finally says enough and picks up his gun again for his inevitable conflict with the bad guys.  The shootout when it finally comes is satisfying enough but too little too late to save the film.

Forsaken might please undiscriminating western fans looking for a fix but recent entries Janie Got A Gun, The Salvation and Sweetwater were all far more entertaining.  But on the bright side, Forsaken is 66 minutes shorter than The Revenant and a full 77 minutes shorter than the short version of The Hateful Eight, so if nothing else Forsaken is at least relatively quick and painless.",1456272000,,1577,4.709090909090909

Donald Sutherland is good, as always.  Brian Cox has one great scene which puts his character's ruthlessness on display. However, if there is one fault in the movie it is the relative shortage of scenes with Kiefer Sutherland and Michael Wincott together.  The scene where Kiefer Sutherland's recuperating character is visited by Michael Wincott elevates the entire narrative.
