8654534,5,B00JXQQ7MW,"This is a very lovely dvd. I've been working with it daily for about 6 weeks now. The instruction is clear. It is filmed from several angles and at different speeds so you can really see what is going on. The way the sections are divided in the dvd menu make it convenient to navigate and get back to exactly the spot you want to practice with without any fussing.

The form itself is delightfully graceful. Because it is presented in short, simple sections, it is easy to learn and feel the chi get activated. The instructor also gives alternate ways of extending and combining the different movements and foot positions so you can vary your daily practice quite a bit once you learn the different parts. Having the possibility for this diversity has made daily practice particularly enjoyable as I get to tailor it to what my body is wanting each day.

I look forward to my practice time and I've definitely been feeling the health benefits of this as well. It has strengthened my hips and legs, helped me feel more grounded, and increased the vitality I feel in my body.",1469404800,6,1073,4.55440414507772
