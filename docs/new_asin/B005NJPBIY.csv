Gregor Macintosh truly remains a savagely underrated guitar virtuoso with his gut-wrenching, soul-stirring leads being played to perfection. While the remaining guitar, drums and bass are all played exactly as they should be, the glaring problem lies with vocalist Nick Holmes. Once the British example of what James Hetfield SHOULD HAVE ended up sounding like, he now just sounds as a singer too ensconced in the cast of post-Depesche Mode framework his vocal chords have been trapped in for around fifteen years. For most singers, their range seems to drop with age but with Holmes his voice has gotten strangely higher and all the angst, aggression, low-end fire and bile have all but disappeared from his once mighty throat. Also, this is not the first live performance I've seen where Holmes just does not seem to be into his job, for whatever reason. No charisma as a frontman who does not play an instrument and just stands there, only one step removed from simply being a disinterested observer.

Holmes vocal performance aside, the other main gripe is the overall lack of many more extra songs, with only a few more played at the end only pushing it to less than 90 minutes overall. Although from what I've seen of live performances in the last five years, this is unfortunately not just a PL fault, as many veteran bands just fail to give you the once standard of around two hours headlining.

All that said, you still get the 'Draconian Times' LP live in it's entirety as well as two promo vids for recent songs, some backstage/on tour home vids, fan interviews and a brief interview with the band.",1416009600,,1846,4.708978328173375

8480547,5,B005NJPBIY,"If you're a big fan of Paradise Lost and if your favorite CD from them is Draconian Times then you should have this. The concert was amazingly well shot and the audio is superb. On a decent sound system it will sound huge. They play all the songs from Draconian Times in order and then a few others from various albums afterward. Overall, I was really looking forward to buying this and watching it, and I was not disappointed at all. The bonus disc contains some cool stuff like interviews with the band and various fans about the Draconian Times album, a couple of music videos, and some other treats as well. The packaging is great and has a booklet inside too. Get this if you're thinking about it, you won't be disappointed.",1345420800,2,729,4.488721804511278
