8622982,1,B00GGZEMXE,This is a Review DVD by musical editors of different magazines.  I was looking for early days concert footage.  (1970-1979).  The review was good but it is a DVD that you view once (maybe twice) and one will never see it again.  I was looking for concert footage.,1479081600,,263,4.416666666666667
