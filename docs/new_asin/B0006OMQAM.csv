2190593,4,B0006OMQAM,"This was a great movie to see the progression of the end of the Plains Indians way of life and the changes they had to make in order to survive.
I would like to see this movie come to DVD.
I think this was Raquel Welches best acting job.",1193616000,13,237,3.857142857142857
2190598,5,B0006OMQAM,"Being a collector of old westerns I had been looking for this for a while. While the picture quality is very good it does take a bit of work to get it to switch over to English at times. Everything considered I'm very happy to have obtained a copy. thank you !

2190602,1,B0006OMQAM,it did look like that move would have been the best but it was so mess up you could not know what the story would be made of,1353283200,,124,3.4642857142857144
2190603,4,B0006OMQAM,"It is wonderful to see a great positive story about one of America's native citizens.  So little attention
is given to the people that inhabited this land long before anyone else have. I appreciated this film, and
would like to see more like it in the future.",1349913600,2,259,4.51063829787234
2190604,5,B0006OMQAM,As this was an older item I felt it was very nicely done.  It was mailed expiditiously and came through unscathed.,1334448000,2,114,4.428571428571429
2190605,4,B0006OMQAM,"I enjoyed the fact that most of the actors were native americans. For those that were supplied with wigs, the wigs were a bit hokey. I also am in search of the full uncut version. Please post if you know of a copy that may be obtained.",1266796800,2,235,4.0212765957446805
2190606,5,B0006OMQAM,A thoroughly entertaining film with great atmosphere. I am searching for the FULL UNCUT version showing Walks Far watching The Lone Ranger at the end of the film. There is also 5 minutes of dialogue with her grandson when he visits her. This makes the film around 127 minutes long. They always miss out this part when they show it on TV. It's such a shame because that last scene enhances the substance of the film and leaves you with a sense of awe. Has anyone got a copy for sale ?,1243296000,7,483,4.260869565217392
2190607,5,B0006OMQAM,This is definitely one of Raquels best performances and to see realisically how the American Indians had to survive. I would like very much for this movie come in a DVD version.,1218067200,10,177,4.5625
8042095,3,B0006OMQAM,"It tries to show them in a different light, not some abstract savage and uncivilized people but to bring humanity to them.  For that it deserves credit and it's not a bad movie (if that was the only standard).  The question is, How accurate is the day to day life as depicted within?  Really, I don't know but if I had to guess, I'd say this is more fiction than reality, or at least a healthy dose of fiction.  Also, where actual history crosses paths with this movie, it's not quite accurate.  The Legend of Walks Far Woman -- which stars Raquel Welch -- was based on a book of the same name by Colin Stuart.  I haven't read the book as of this writing.  Lastly, even though I watched the movie, it wasn't this particular DVD so I can't confirm this is a good copy.",1508976000,,767,4.212328767123288
