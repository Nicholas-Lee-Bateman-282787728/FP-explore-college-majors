8517531,5,B007IHH3JY,"The Seduction of Mimi and Love & Anarchy were released as single DVDs in the past with poor visual quality. I owned those DVDs and never realized how bad a job those transfers were done until I bought this set. The picture is pristine for both movies at long last and that goes for All Screwed Up as well (which was not out on DVD prior to this set).

These movies are real classics. The Seduction of Mimi was even remade in Hollywood with Richard Pryor as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Which-Way-Is-Up/dp/B00472RCX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Which Way Is Up?</a>. The Seduction of Mimi and Love & Anarchy also start the collaboration between Wertmuller and her leading man Giancarlo Giannini. The two went on to make five films together and these are the first two (the others are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swept-Away/dp/B000E3L7M8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swept Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Beauties/dp/B000H1GOK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Beauties</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Full-of-Rain/dp/B003ODIUZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Full of Rain</a>.

I cannot recommend these movies more especially if you discovered the ones I mentioned above. Love and Anarchy is a period piece set during the height of Mussolini's regime prior to the start of the war. This has much more drama than comedy while All Screwed Up and The Seduction of Mimi are contemporary Italian comedies.

This set is more of a companion release to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lina-Wertmuller-Collection-Summer-Night-The-Nymph-Swept-Away-Seven-Beauties-Ferdinando-and-Carolina/dp/B0009KA8JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lina Wertmuller Collection (Summer Night / The Nymph / Swept Away / Seven Beauties / Ferdinando and Carolina)</a>.",1372896000,6,1989,7.6017316017316015
