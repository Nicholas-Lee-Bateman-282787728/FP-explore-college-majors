3915758,5,B002E9HML0,"My 6 year old son got this movie as a birthday present. I am starting to memorize it, he loves it so much and watches it constantly. The story and characters are great, and we absolutely LOVE the song ""Go GO Thomas!"" We have a great time dancing to it when it comes on. I find myself singing it at work!

A GREAT movie for the Thomas fan!",1254268800,,338,3.9705882352941178
3915759,5,B002E9HML0,"""Hero of The Rails"" is great Thomas fun and if you have a chance to catch it at a real theater, by all means do.  It's quite an experience!  (All the little kids bouncing around... popcorn flying... energy level sky-high...)

But for the home, what you should know is that like in ""Thomas and the Great Discovery""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thomas-Friends-The-Great-Discovery/dp/B001BEK856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thomas & Friends: The Great Discovery</a>, Thomas makes a discovery in this film, but this time it's not a place but a person that he finds!  The venerable Hiro, Master of the Rails.  Hiro, is an absolute delight, by the way.  He's an engine from Japan that came to Sodor before any other engines.  Unfortunately, because he was first, and because he came from so far away, when he broke down they put him on a sideline where he was soon forgotten. And this is where Thomas finds him.

What makes Hiro delightful is that he finds the good in everyone: imperious Gordon, vain James, it doesn't matter.  This trait, of course, brings him friends.  And soon, all of our favorite steamies are trying to locate parts for him in an effort to make him whole-and-useful-- because they are afraid that he'll be scraped if they fail.

Missing in this one is a certain devious diesel, so the crews' opposition is provided by egotistical Spencer, who annoys everyone with his boasting and shenanigans.  He turns out to be a pretty effective foil, having his way right up to the end, when Thomas emerges victorious and Spencer is not only humbled, but comes to regret his previous behavior.

So as it turns out, ""Hero of The Rails"" is a story of friendship and trust, and redemption.

Talking Points:::
Moms like me will delight in the positive messages that are in this Thomas movie.  Thomas is hardly cheeky at all, and in fact, is patient, a good-sport, and even manages to 'turn the other cheek' when Spencer insults him.

Though it's strange to see the human characters move, it is really great to see more than the Steamies' eyes move.  And though the animation is not Lucasfilms quality, the production features some great shots, like having a train roll over you, and seeing from Thomas' prospective what it looks like to go barreling down the tracks.

The Music is awful, and that's all I'll say about that.  The voices, however, for the Steamies are good, although there could be more distinction between them.

There are a few new characters.  Victor at the Works.  His fumbling assistant, Kevin, who isn't an engine, and Hiro, of course.

All in all, this is a must-have flick at this point, because Thomas, Percy, Toby and the rest of the Crew are more alive than ever.

3915760,5,B002E9HML0,"The fourth Thomas movie down the line (after ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"", ""Calling All Engines"", and ""The Great Discovery""), ""Hero of the Rails"" makes the biggest change in Thomas's history so far; the entire film is done in CGI animation produced by Nitrogen Studios in Canada. All of the characters are now individually voiced, although Micheal Brandon returns to narrate through the film.

In the story, Spencer, a big silver engine from the mainland, is visiting Sodor to help build a private summer house. Thomas, after being teased about his size, foolishly tries to compete with Spencer, but ends up crashing onto an abandoned old line. There he finds Hiro, an old abandoned engine who once worked on Sodor long ago. Wanting to prevent him from being scrapped, Thomas promises to help return him to his former glory, along with the help of Victor and Kevin (a steam engine and a crane, respectively), who work at Sodor's famous ""Steamworks"". Along the way, he has to avoid the suspicious eyes of Spencer, and keep Hiro's secret from Sir Topham Hatt.
Not spoiling the end of the story, it's vaguely similar to ""Magic Railroad"", but it was fantastically executed overall. Hiro's character is very believable and likable, and Victor and Kevin make a wonderful pair on-screen. The story's moral is laid in through the narration, but isn't thrown right into the viewer's face, unlike most children's films, which is a refreshing change.

The film's main focus, however, is the new animation. While the original model series was wonderful, the new CGI is a breath of fresh air. The moving faces give a whole new life to the characters, and each locomotive looks as realistic as they can be. The backgrounds, scenery, and buildings are far more detailed than something I would have expected from a film for children. There are plenty of new camera angles, too, that could never have been achieved with the models, such as shots from under the engine, or swooping shots of two engines racing side by side, or panoramic shots of morning skies across massive mountains.

The voice acting is fantastic as well. Thomas's new voice fits his personality to the tee. Hiro has a gentle Japanese accent, which suits him very well. Michael Brandon does an even better job at narrating than ever, and he really helps to bring the story to life. I would advice the scriptwriters to work more on the actual lines though; the format used in the film gets repetitive over time (for example, ""Thomas's wheels whirred and wobbled"" ""Thomas's boiler was bubbling"" or ""his pistons were pounding) and the ""phrases"" the engines use come and go (""Fizzling fireboxes!"" ""Blistering boilers!"" ""Rattle my rods!"" ""Cinders and ashes!"").

Overall, however, I feel that ""Hero of the Rails"" is one of Thomas's best films yet, and I can't wait to see Thomas in his new animated format in the near future. HiT Entertainment and Nitrogen Studios put a lot of work and effort into this new film, and it shows. Old and new fans alike are sure to enjoy Thomas in his newest adventure.",1253923200,76,3049,4.846449136276392

3915764,4,B002E9HML0,"I agree totally with the other 2 reviews I read.. one of the reviews said:

""There were no grating characters or voices"".. I couldn't agree more.. they should have just had one great voice do all the engines b/c there was no variety?

Also I was not sure about the full animation either.. but stellar!!

Hiro and the story is great, and yes they hit on teamwork, but so does every episode!!

I so want to give it 5 stars but can't.. it just didn't blow my mind.. but it was great and you kids will adore it :)",1252540800,,509,4.111111111111111
3915765,4,B002E9HML0,"I ordered this DVD for my 3-year-old son the day it came out, and just sat through two viewings back to back! Obviously, my son loved it! He wants to play the games again (the special features), but it's bath and bed time, so it will have to wait until tomorrow. What did I think as a parent? The movie is pretty good, actually. I wasn't so sure how I would like the full-animation style, being used to the limited motion of the traditional motorized models, but the filmmakers pulled it off really well. The scenery was beautiful, the engines were nicely rendered, the voicework was nice (each individual engine has its own voice here). Overall, the movie was very pleasing. There were no grating characters or voices. There was a good message about teamwork and honesty and helpfulness (typical Thomas fare). I'm sure glad we bought the DVD, as my son will enjoy many, many viewings, but this movie failed to attain the charm, the appeal and the impact of the last Thomas feature film, The Great Discovery. Between the two, definitely get The Great Discovery first.",1252540800,4,1067,4.680851063829787
3915766,5,B002E9HML0,"My 4 year old grandson and I watched this yesterday on PBS.
What a wonderful time we had !
Hiro is such a great engine. He is kind and speaks softly, he is wise and patient and never boasts.
Unlike the show-off engine Spencer, Hiro keeps his dignity and makes many friends.
I loved how Hiro had such a kind face and spirit. He was the Hero of the line in the old days after being shipped to the Island of Sodor from Japan and had gone into disrepair. He is fixed up by Sir Topham Hat and then is restored to all his glory.
All our new friend wants is to go back to his island where his home is.
His new friends will miss him and Hiro will miss them, but we know that we have all made a good friend in Hiro.
I can't wait to buy this DVD.
I'm even going to use Hiro's kind face as the background on my computer :)",1252540800,,811,3.8622754491017965

3915771,4,B002E9HML0,Hero of the Rails was good. The plot was good and this is the first Thomas movie to have CGI. The new characters are good. Hiro is a great character and has a great backstory in the scene where Thomas finds him. Victor is a good character and is like a father figure of the engines and is pretty good. Kevin is very funny. The song Go Go Thomas was catchy and good. I also like how the movie made Spencer the main antagonist. The voices for the characters are pretty good.  The US voices are James and Henry and awful. Overall this movie was good. I think it was a very good movie.,1505606400,,581,4.0964912280701755

As we're going to join him and  his parents for a ride on Thomas the Train this afternoon (June 2014), I looked for a streaming video thru my Prime Amazon account to learn what I might be in store for. I gotta say this video is delightful.  It's a positive, engaging, and graphically pleasurable tale of Thomas and his friends and how they join hands to help an older, disregarded train they found pushed aside and wasting away from neglect.  Through this story is the on going conflict with a huge, intimidating (bully?) train that Thomas endures (I won't give away the ending) through encouragement and the positive support of his friends.  It's a happy, inspiring video that I'd recommend to any parent or grandparent with a young child.  My grandson plays his Thomas dvd's over and over and over!

3916060,3,B002E9HML0,"My son loves all the Thomas shows, toys, books... everything!  However, I find it as boring and stale as anything I've ever seen.  Other kids shows, like Sesame Street, have a lot more adult appeal AND contain more educational content.  The latter is the reason for the reduced number of stars.  Besides the trains have numbers on them (which are rarely referenced), there is no effort made to teach numbers, math, spelling, etc.  It's just trains getting in trouble and having attitudes with one another, then regretting it.  The stories aren't even unique.  Nearly every Thomas movie has a race, a train struggling to pull heavy cars, and a cave-in and/or bridge out.  This will all be wrapped around the introduction of a new character, which my son will then want to play with.

Thomas is good when you want to be a bad parent and let the TV be the babysitter.  That's it.  But it really, truly excels in this role.",1386460800,,919,4.611111111111111

3916077,5,B002E9HML0,"When this special was first announced, people (or at least nostalgic fans of the classic series) were very very very worried if the show would automatically be terrible just because the show entered the CGI animation. To me, I didn't judge it until the actual special came out and watched a lot of it. After finishing it, I was actually impressed with it. I mean the balance of characters was great, because unlike the previous ones, there weren't too much characters, which gave time to focus some parts to new characters. Plus having two new characters be international ones (Hiro from Japan and Victor from Cuba), which shows that the world around them has diverse characters. :)

While some parts of the story had excessive rhyming (like ""is this Thomas and Friends or Dr. Seuss?""), at least as long as the story was easy to follow and entertaining to kids, it's good enough for me!

Also, the newer episodes are still read like a story, with one person doing all the voices.  However, this movie is nothing like that.  The animation looks like anything else that you can see on children's television (ie. Chuggington on Disney) and the voices are done by different people instead of one person.

3916133,4,B002E9HML0,"Hero of the Rails is a surprisingly effective movie that demonstrates the potential the Thomas series still has.

Breaking from the usual plot formula of the show, Thomas finds an old engine left for scrap, and tries to repair him in secret. Meanwhile visiting engine Spencer is feeling sore from his competition with the Sodor engines, trying to sabotage them in any way possible.

For a show that was admired for its trainset-come-to-life imagery, changing Thomas to a CGI show seems like a controversial move. However, Hero of the Rails shows the new medium being used to its full potential - wonderful scenery, dynamic ""camera"" work like tracking shots, and a new sense of scale in Thomas' world. In fact, one new setting is the Steamworks - a giant workshop modeled on several installations from the glory days of steam.

There are new characters, too, and while often Thomas introduces new characters with little purpose other than merchandising potential, these seem like natural extensions of the Sodor world: Victor, the even-tempered workshop engine; Kevin, the Steamworks' accident-prone mobile crane, and Hiro, the abandoned engine whom Thomas and friends hope to restore.

The movie's not without its flaws. For instance there's little regard for actual railway practice, which the older shows almost always adhered to. Finally there are times when the narrator keeps talking even though it's perfectly clear through the characters and on-screen action what's happening. It's not really adding anything other than repetitive rhyming and alliteration.

Still, Hero of the Rails is a refreshing chapter in Thomas' history, and deserves a look.",1289260800,4,1654,5.273764258555133

3916140,5,B002E9HML0,"I bought Hero of the Rails for my 2-year old.  He is an absolute Thomas fanatic!

This movie does not dissappoint.  Initially, I was not a fan of the CGI.  After watching what seemed like endless hours of Thomas minatures and voiced-over character dolls in the older shows, it seemed that was the only proper way to watch Thomas.  The CGI would simply cause ""confusion and delay"".

Was I wrong!  CGI breathes new life into this series.  The characters have lost that ""homey"" feel of the minatures, but this is more than made up for by the quality of the graphics.  The scenes flow very well, and I must admit, they hold your attention better than ""The Great Discovery"".

The storyline is very believable: a broken-down and forgotten engine is made new again.  This seems to be a recurring theme in many Thomas episodes: Something old is made new.  Or, something old is worth keeping around, e.g., steam engines in the age of diesel.

The characters are great!  Some of the voices are bit overboard, such as Gordon's ""High & Mighty"", and Henry's whine.  Spencer's voice is perfect, as are Hiro's and Emily's.  Personally, I don't care for Thomas's voice.  It seems a bit too youngish, but considering who this DVD is aimed at, it works for kids.  As was mentioned in an earlier post, Victor and Kevin are a match made in Heaven: the seasoned veteran and the new kid in the shop.  Perfect!

Without getting too specific and spoiling the movie for all, I will just say this movie is great for kids and adults.  I have even snuck it into the DVD player when no one was around...

Buy it.  You won't regret it!",1272153600,13,1605,4.515679442508711

I like the story and found that it does not have many negative or offensive words like some of the other Thomas stories (we play the movie in Spanish at my house because is our first language).",1268265600,,341,4.451612903225806

3916143,4,B002E9HML0,"If you don't like the CGI versions, skip this.  However, my 2-y/o loves every incarnation of Thomas the Tank engine he's ever laid eyes on, CGI or no, so no regrets re: this purchase.  I myself prefer the pre-CGI episodes narrated by George Carlin, but I didn't buy this for me, ha!  Though it ain't Pixar, the movie's CGI quality is above-average compared to CGI used in many kids' TV shows.  The colors are nice.  This movie still has the familiar narration of Michael Brandon; however, the characters are voiced by other individuals, which in my opinion, is a very welcome change.  Mr. Brandon is not very consistent in how he voices the characters on the show, which annoys me.  Also, it's nice to hear the female characters speak with a feminine voice for a change!

In addition to Hiro, there are two other new characters who work at the Sodor Steamworks, Victor and Kevin.  Kevin doesn't really add much to the storyline, but Victor is a nice addition to the franchise.  It's not the strongest of stories, but in my opinion there isn't anything disagreeable or offensive for my toddler, so I would say it's a worthwhile purchase if your little one is a die-hard fan.",1263427200,2,1173,4.6231884057971016

I hope the creators of Thomas stick with some of their older model shot series as well as creating more cartoon quality series.

3916148,1,B002E9HML0,"Adding CG effects to make the characters faces move kills the general idea of the magic that this series is supposed to bring.  The new voices for the characters are awful, and the narrator gets on my nerves quickly.  Whoever took over the Thomas series needs to make it the way it was in the beginning.  Having Ringo Starr narrate, not hiring voice actors for the engines, and adding more action and thrills to the show.  They should not be afraid to show some dark situations in Thomas.  The original British Thomas children books had some dark situations in it and it sold extraordinarily well.  The series has turned into a disgrace.",1262217600,12,637,4.642857142857143

3916150,4,B002E9HML0,"This new Thomas and Friends movies uses more animation than the old TV series, typical of recent Thomas stories available on video. I'm not in favor of the animated facial expressions and speech, nor the fully animated Topham Hat. However the story in this particular full length movie was much better than previous Thomas movies or episodes. My 3 year old was not overwhelmed or confused by it, and we all really liked the new character, a Japanese engine called Hiro. The story was well-written, and except for the open ended fairy tale ending - it reaches a reasonable conclusion. The movie also used one of the better voice narrators, though not for all the character voices.

I recommend it and hope you can get a good deal on it.",1262131200,6,735,4.653846153846154

3916152,5,B002E9HML0,"I confess that I wasn't sure what I thought about the CG animation at first. The older versions with those exquisitely detailed models, are very inventive, and charming. And they really require kids to use their imaginations to fill in what the models could not.

But Hero of the Rails is the best of the Thomas films.  It is beautiful. They took lots of time with detail on the engines. You get a sense of speed and movement on tracks, and ways the engines move around them with each other, like you couldn't before. Terrific panoramas of the engines racing.

Someone mentioned something about the language of the script being repetitive; it is, but in a Dr. Seuss sort of way--with plenty of alliteration, words with similar sounds and senses that build on each other, and bounce off each other.  I think that's actually one of the movie's strengths as far as being a kid's movie. The pacing of the speech too is especially good too. Everything is clearly pronounced--great diction.

And, thank goodness, they ALSO paid a lot of attention to the character faces: the CG animation gives you a great sense of all the personalities through many subtle movements in the characters' expressions.

One of the very best things about this film is the story. There's tons of adventure, but there's also a lot of heart. And the plot is not petty or cute;  Without being heavy handed or preachy, Thomas is concerned about something, and someone, that really matters.",1259452800,,1457,4.757936507936508
3916153,5,B002E9HML0,My daughter loves Thomas the Tank Engine but sometimes the videos make me want to eat nails.  That stupid song gets caught in my head and the stories just seem so short and underdeveloped.  This movie is very different.  The music is more modern (read: no annoying children's choir)and the character voices are much more natural.  The longer story was developed well and did not seem to end abruptly.  I actually enjoyed watching this Thomas video with my daughter.,1259280000,26,465,4.8354430379746836

3916155,4,B002E9HML0,"My 5-year-old son fell in love with Hiro after watching this full-length film. Hiro technically comes from Japan and his voice is performed by an English-speaking Japanese actor. He was ""master of the rails"" in his home country, represented in flashback with iconic Japanese woodblock-like images. After years of work in Sodor, Hiro is abandoned when he starts to break down, and Thomas finds him in the forest and helps to get him rebuilt. Spencer starts out as the bad guy but learns generosity and modesty for a decent lesson at the end.

The film has computer-generated illustration instead of the static figures of earlier Thomas episodes. Each of the trains has its own voice and moving facial expressions, with a narrator to provide plot points.",1258156800,3,752,4.968253968253968

The new CGI format is wonderful, and I prefer it to the traditional style (this may be my preference because we started with this format in the first place).

The story has a lot more substance than I expected--there's actually a story and some character development! (Keeping in mind it is still a Thomas kid's movie.)  Spencer has been my 2 year old's VERY favorite Thomas train, for some reason, and stories with Spencer are hard to find so we were excited when this video came out. Although he isn't the ""nice"" engine in the story, the kids still love it and like to see that Spencer redeemed himself in the end.
