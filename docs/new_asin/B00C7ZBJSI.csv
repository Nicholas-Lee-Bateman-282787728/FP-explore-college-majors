8578527,5,B00C7ZBJSI,"Gladys Bensimon has made an extraordinary film about a group of former Cuban political prisoners from the Cuban Revolution. Narrated by Andy Garcia this is a story that Must be told- and it is told beautifully!  Now men, they meet weekly in Union City NJ. We get a most revealing look at the hopes they had in Fidel and the Revolution, which proved so false. Witness this testimony for yourself in this excellent film!  Experience the human resilience, community and brotherhood!!!",1369612800,2,481,4.925925925925926
