5274360,4,B0096RC4X4,"The 25th box set makes this I guess the silver anniversary of MST (at least as far as box sets are concerned), so for this release we have 2 Joel and 2 Mike episodes, featuring the great riffing of the MST3K crew and some cool extras to add to the experience of each film.

Episode 110, ""Robot Holocaust"": We have a ""Mad Max"" ripoff here (cept without the budget, charm or insanity of Mel Gibson), where robots have enslaved humans and our only savior is a man named Neo (clearly where the name of ""The Matrix"" hero came from) who comes from the atomic wastelands of the outer world to lead a revolution on the city of New Terra and destroy ""The Dark One"" and his hold on the remaining humans. This quest takes Neo, the daughter of a scientist, a bumbling C3PO knock-off robot (who is just beyond irritating, like Jar Jar Binks, and just as depressing), a lion cloth mute guy, an amazon woman and others through the wilderness (Central Park in parts) as they make their way to ""The Power Station"", where ""The Dark One"" resides.

Oh and there's also a henchwoman named Valaria, who gives bad acting a whole new meaning, speaking her lines with a heavy french or german or whatever accent, she provides a lot of fodder for the MST3K crew as does the bad sets (which a lot look like basements in an actual power station), the bad effects (sock puppet worms in a tunnel, the bad robot costumes), everything about this screams bad and Joel and the Bots do quite well here even for a Season 1 episode. It's worth watching especially since there are things from this they refer to in later episodes (""Get to the power station"", ""They weren't prepared for the Robot Holocaust""). Side Note: Angelika Jager as Valaria can't act for nothing, but boy is she eye candy in this movie.

Episode 508, ""Operation Kid Brother (""Operation Double 007""): Whatever you call it, this James Bond spoof did have some cast members from the earlier Bond movies and even starred Sean Connery's brother Neil as the hero, and this is the usual mess of action sequences, fights, spy gadgetry, pretty women (lots of pretty women I might add) and a somewhat confusing plot. Produced and filmed in Italy, this did have some nice locations, but not much of note, thankfully Joel, Servo and Crow do very well with this one as they usually did with spy flicks like this. I personally liked ""Secret Agent Super Dragon"" better than this one, but this is certainly great for a Joel episode. Side note: Again a lot of the women in here are very nice to look at, which does make this film easier to view than most.

Episode 615, ""Kitten With A Whip"": This oddity stars Ann Margret as a young woman who is prone to violence and one night ends up in the home of a politician (John Forsythe), well needless to say this turns bad once he finds her cause her and her gang terrorize him, which makes him fearful he'll be ousted from his office. This is probably one of the few that was competently made at least enough so that Mike and the bots got some good lines out, but it's kind of a ""just there"" episode. It's nothing memorable, but nothing terrible, it just isn't one that's high on my list to watch over and over again.

Episode 801, ""Revenge of the Creature"": Right after the huge success of ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"", we have this rushed out sequel where a couple of guys are in the Amazon and use dynamite charges to knock ""The Creature"" out and bring him to the U.S. so Americans can see him and they can make tons of money off of his exhibit. Of course he escapes and seeks his revenge by tipping over a car, terrorizing some people at a restaurant and of course he captures a woman to either make her his bride or just advance the plot (I'm going with the latter). This stars John Agar (""The Mole People"") and was also the first known role for a little known actor named Clint Eastwood as a scientist, which received a couple of good lines from the crew. This was the first episode on the Sci-Fi channel and also the debut of Bill Corbett as the voice of Crow. I enjoyed this episode as the Sci-Fi era kinda gets a bad rap (I never cared for the story arc, Sci-Fi execs wanted the show to have), but this was a great one in my opinion.

Extras include

-Introductions by Joel on ""Robot Holocaust"" and ""Operation Kid Brother""

-Introductions by Mike on ""Kitten With A Whip"" and ""Revenge of the Creature""

-Life After MST3K: Josh Weinstein (""Robot Holocaust"" disc), Bill Corbett (""Revenge of the Creature"")

-Jack Arnold At Universal: We get a short documentary on Jack Arnold who directed ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" and other films and this was a very well done piece as it has a lot of interesting stuff on him.

This is another good box set from Shout Factory, with the only downer being ""Kitten With A Whip"" (though it's still better than most sitcoms out there). So I recommend this set to any MST fan.",1356134400,,4884,4.4519015659955254
5274361,5,B0096RC4X4,what can I say.  another set of classic shows that you must see!! I have all 24 previously released compilations and enjoy them all again and again.,1355097600,4,148,4.481481481481482
5274362,5,B0096RC4X4,"As a TV on DVD reviewer, I received an advance copy of this set. A more complete review can be found at classictvdvdreviews.blogspot.com.

Before sharing my thoughts on this set, I would like to make a plea to folks who post tongue-in-cheek but still malicious reviews of sets that they have not watched. For the love of all the cheesy but beloved shows out there, please refrain from getting a laugh at the literal expense of both fans of vintage cult favorites and the studio that produces them. No one is making a fortune from these overall labors of love,and they deserve at least at honest reviews.

I love virtually every Shout title, think that they have done a excellent job with every release, and can say that their PR staff is aces.

These good folks have provided great previously abandoned shows such as later seasons of ""Barney Miller,"" ""All in the Family,"" and ""The Larry Sanders Show."" I would also not be surprised if they ultimately release ""The Bob Newhart Show"" S5 and S6.

I truly advocate free speech and respect the right of anyone to share negative thoughts about a DVD set after he or she has watched it. Doing so beforehand is simply childish and perhaps more harmful than realized.

I will say as well that (as my slamming of ""Magic Mike"" proves) my reviews are always honest, and that MST 3K sets are the ONLY DVD sets that I have bought right when they came out to ensure that I received one.

Returning to the review, Volume XXV truly is one of my favorite of all 25 MST 3K DVD sets. The four films show the series' true range by including the juvenile delinquent melodrama ""Kitten With a Whip,"" the horribly low-budget action-adventure drama ""Operation Double 007"" a.k.a. ""Operation Kid Brother,"" an Ed Wood quality monster flick in the form of ""The Monster's Revenge,"" and the mainstay low-budget sci-fi disaster ""Robot Holocaust.""

These episodes are particularly noteworthy for their host segments as well. They include an first season pre ""TV's Frank"" episode that many folks missed because several cable systems did not include the Comedy Channel, now Comedy Central, then. We also get the season nine premiere that resolved the season eight cliffhanger, and are treated to a few invention exchanges.

I rarely laugh out loud or even smile during movies or television shows but laughed pretty loudly through most of ""Kitten With A Whip"" and ""The Monster's Revenge."" The others elicited quite a few chuckles.

I would literally choke down hamdingers or (maybe)even sit through ""Magic Mike"" again for the chance to meet anyone associated with MST 3K. I would also provide a limb of choice to riff on ""Mike"" with the crew.

Each DVD of the four episodes also includes a newly filmed introduction by that episode's host. These are entertaining and informative commentaries. We also get the standard but above average mini-movie posters. Alas, we do not get a collectible action figure this time.",1353974400,12,2927,4.824351297405189
5274363,5,B0096RC4X4,"If you love MST3K you have to get this boxed set. I love all the episodes, so this was a definate for my collection.",1353715200,,116,3.875
5274364,5,B0096RC4X4,"Every one of these DVDs are wonderful, but it is worth the price of the set to get ""Kitten with a Whip"" alone! that one is a classic that I haven't seen in years, but am looking forward to as soon as it comes out in December.",1351468800,14,225,3.8085106382978724
5274365,5,B0096RC4X4,I'm mainly compensating for the bogus 1-star review below.  These are some great episodes and I am confident Shout Factory will maintain their customarily high standards when it comes to the bonus items and image quality.  Many of the episodes in this set were never expected to see the light of day on DVD (or any other format for that matter) so Shout Factory gets 5 stars just for working out the legal tangles involved in bringing these to us.,1347580800,44,447,4.575
5274366,5,B0096RC4X4,"Why don't you keep your idiotic reviews to yourself ,if you were a true fan of the show you would know these are great episode sets because the episodes have been circulating around since MST3K began. If you don't have something helpful to say quit bringing down the star rating on these sets!",1347494400,31,293,4.547169811320755

5274368,5,B0096RC4X4,"This set contains some must-see episodes. The earliest two episodes star show creator Joel Hodgson as host while the other two star show head writer Mike Nelson as host. Three episodes are from the Comedy Channel/Comedy Central era of the show while the last episode is from the Sci-Fi Channel period. There are numerous call-back jokes and references to Robot Holocaust in later episodes of the show including the Valaria visit on the hexfield view screen during episode 201 Rocketship X-M. If you've never seen this episode it is MSTie required viewing. Then there's the bad, really bad James Bond knock-off made in Italy using Sean Connery's brother Neil plus Lois Maxwell, Bernard Lee and other actual James Bond movie actors. Top it off with a John Forsythe and Ann Margret suspense drama and a mediocre sequel to Creature From The Black Lagoon featuring Clint Eastwood in a bit part and you've the full range of what made MST3K such a great and eclectic comedy show.

110- ROBOT HOLOCAUST with short: COMMANDO CODY PT 9 (partial)
This Italian/USA 1986 color science fiction film shot in New York stars absolutely no one you have ever heard of, but you'll remember Angelika Jager as Valaria long after you see it. For every latter day MSTie who has ever wondered why all the ""you and your daughter are doomed"" comments in episodes post season one of the show this will solve the mystery for you. A hero named ""Neo"" (a few years before The Matrix was made) tries to help a scientist's daughter free him and other slaves from the clutches of the evil Dark One (""da-gwan"" the way Valaria pronounces it). They ""have to get to the power station"" (another oft used MST call-back line) to do it. Comedy ensues with only a little bit of it being intentional. There are goofy robots that are supposed to be goofy and evil robots that are even goofier. The acting is some of the worst in any MSTed movie. The commentary and host segments in this late season one episode are hilarious as MST3K really begins to find what works best at this point. And since the movie is a bit short we're also treated to another hilarious episode of Radar Men From The Moon. I'd buy this set for this episode alone, but there's more greatness to be had here.

508- OPERATION KID BROTHER (aka OPERATION DOUBLE 007 and OK CONNERY)
This 1967 Italian film is the ultimate James Bond knock-off. Originally titled ""OK Connery"" as well as sometimes ""Operation Double 007"" the film makers decided to hire many of the key actors from the actual James Bond films including Lois Maxwell (Miss Moneypenny), Bernard Lee (M), Adolfo Celli (Thunderball) and Daniela Bianci (From Russia With Love). Of course they (B. Lee and L. Maxwell) don't have the same character names as in the actual Bond films, but the attempt to make this look like an actual Bond film by hiring certain key actors is blatant. Any similarity between the original wonderful Bond films and this tripe ends there. This movie has none of the flare, wit or atmosphere of a Goldfinger or Dr. No, what it does have is Sean Connery's non-actor brother in the lead role! This allows the screenplay to refer to the main character of the film as the brother of a much better known secret agent throughout the film. The only thing that compares favorably with an actual Bond film is the soundtrack which was composed by Ennio Morricone. It's the best part of the film. If you're a fan of the original Bond films you'll enjoy seeing this oddity and what MST3K did with it, it's hilarious. There's a fantastic host segment where Joel and the 'Bots compare the careers of Sean and Neil Connery and another where Torgo (Manos Hands Of Fate) returns to Deep 13.

615- KITTEN WITH A WHIP
This 1967 black-and-white film stars Ann Margret as Jody, a femme fatale and John Forsythe as David Stratton, the dumbest politician ever. Jody is a vicious and violent juvenile delinquent who escapes from reform school and seeks refuge at the home of David. When bad things happen David is held captive literally and figuratively by Jody and her gang and his fear that he will lose his ability to hold public office. The movie can be pretty painful to watch as David becomes the victim of Jody and his own fears repeatedly throughout the film. Unfortunately, the film is well made and engrossing enough such that it does not make for a great episode of the show, but repeat viewings will reveal some good comedy after you know what to expect from the film and can focus on the MST3K jokes. One highlight is a host segment in which Kevin Murphy appears quite literally as a ""kitten with a whip"", a part he would reprise occasionally in later episodes and Turkey Day segments.

801- REVENGE OF THE CREATURE
This 1955 black-and-white inferior sequel to the classic Creature From The Black Lagoon stars John Agar, Lori Nelson and Nestor Paiva. It also features a little known new (at the time) actor named Clint Eastwood in a bit part as a lab technician. The Creature is captured and taken to an aquarium in Florida where of course, tragedy ensues when he kidnaps the female scientist with which he's inexplicably become smitten. It's classic 1950s era sci-fi when the monster carries off the beautiful girl. What's notable about this episode is that MST3K not only got a fairly well known old sci-fi movie, but it's the premiere episode of the newly relaunched MST3K on the Sci-Fi Channel! Bill Corbett makes his first appearance as Crow T. Robot after the departure of Trace Beaulieu from the show. The Sci-Fi Channel episodes feature the newly revamped Satellite of Love sets post MST3K The Movie and eventually the introduction of new characters to ""send them the movie"" like Brain Guy and Bobo operating under the direction of Pearl Forrester. Of course the lyrics to the opening theme song have been changed once again to reflect the changes to the show. In spite of all the changes forced on the show and the audience by the departure of many key cast members as well as the show's cancellation and rebirth on the Sci-Fi Channel it's a pretty funny episode making fun of the core film genre of the show, low budget science fiction. Don't miss it!

Overall, this is another eclectic mix of episodes representing a wide range of eras of the show. Shout! Factory has done an amazing job yet again of securing key episodes in the history of MST3K and no MSTie will want to be without this set. I can't wait to get to the power station for the Robot Holocaust!

- Introductions by Mike Nelson and Joel Hodgson

5274391,5,B0096RC4X4,"I'm not much of a fan of the fantasy films the guys covered over the years, so I'm not big into the included Hercules film, but the rest are some of my favorites. Shoutcast continues to offer great box sets with nice extras.  Low budget extras, but extras nonetheless.  For the first time ever, though, I have received an incomplete box set - one of the mini posters was missing.  I only had three.  I'm sure Shoutcast would send me one in the mail if I asked nicely, but it's not really worth it for one piece of paper.  What matters here are the movies; Pumaman, and The Thing That Couldn't Die are some of the best the series has produced.

Pumaman features what may be the whiniest, most 70s-era ""hero"" ever put to film  the oddly named Tony Farms, who has some power.  Of some sort.  Thanks to the Aztecs, somehow look, it really doesn't matter.  He spends most of his time complaining, wearing sensible slacks and being hoisted by his nether regions in front of a front protected skyline of London on the one day it wasn't covered in smog in 1980.

Untamed Youth has Mamie Van Doren and Eddie ""Summertime Blues"" Cochran playing a character named 'Bong'.  It's a decent outing, but not their best effort.  It was one of (if not the) first movie that was not sci-fi themed in the series.  Hercules and the Captive Women is another 'meh' film.  The guys try valiantly, but I always wind up zoning out during these colorful but boring Hercules films.  Sorry.

The Thing That Couldn't Die is another from the Sci-Fi era.  Whereas Pumaman came near the series' end, this one was from season 8, and the energy of being on a new network, with a new lease on life is evident in the energy put in riffing and skits.  Poor Jessica is touched with a non-specific divining gift.  She's ""a water witch"", among other things, and thinks everything is evil.  Evil in the ground, evil trees, evil snacks, evil rhododendron!  Evil does abound, but it's second banana to the dolts who populate this late-era Universal stinker.  Most of the film is dumb-guy Mike carrying around the head of a long-dead but long-cursed individual named Gideon who seems more ""theater!"" than ""conquistador!"" but who am I to judge.  One of my personal favorites.",1434758400,,2228,4.568181818181818

5274404,5,B0096RC4X4,"""The Thing That Couldn't Die,"" filmed with a no-name cast while Universal was busy laying off its writers, is a slow-moving 1958 horror movie about a teenage ""water witch,"" her ineffectual love interest, and a demonic severed head. It's one of those unwatchable-without-the-riffing MST3K episodes, good but not unmissable.

""Hercules and the Captive Women,"" starring no one you've ever heard of, would be pretty entertaining on its own, if anyone could figure out what was going on. It has one captive woman and many, many captive men, and if nothing else, this film gives us the immortal line, ""Today we celebrate Uranus!""

""Untamed Youth"" is a 1957 teen exploitation picture starring the generously endowed Mamie Van Doren, and is surprisingly funny for a season one episode. The best of the lot is ""The Pumaman,"" a staggeringly inept, low budget 1980 Italian import about the world's whiniest superhero vs. an evil mastermind with a mind-control mask.

5274422,5,B0096RC4X4,"An excellent representation of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes!  As other reviewers have pointed out, the gem here is ""Puma Man,"" a Sci Fi Channel-era episode that must be seen to be believed.  The movie was only shown a couple of times back in the day, and became a fan favorite due to its goofy plot, riffing catchphrase, and of course gratuitous Donald Pleasance.  Shout seems to have undertaken mystical, arcane, and ambiguous rights negotiations to release this one, and we're glad they did.

""Hercules And The Captive Women"" is a classic Joel-era swords 'n sandals involving Hercules and a beautiful princess, with a nasty cougar-like mother who desires Herc for her very own.  It's incomprehensible and of course....yawn...I forget.  But this MST3K experiment has the infamous ""Lawn Baby"" invention exchange, which is kind of twisted and pretty funny.

Experiment 805, ""The Thing That Couldn't Die,"" is another rather obscure Sci Fi era experiment only shown a couple of times.  One of the early season 8 experiments are always welcome for DVD preservation.  It involves a psychic dude ranch girl...well, nevermind, the plot isn't important.  It is the first experiment that has the ""Observers"", guys in clown makeup that carry their brains (blue of course) in a large dish.  They're not as omnipotent as they let on, and we're glad Bill Corbett's turn was funny enough to carry the gag on for the remaining two seasons of the series.

The weakest entrant is experiment 112, ""Untamed Youth,"" a 1950s era Mamie Van Doren-era girl in trouble flick.  The production values of season 1 were rougher than in later years, and it's perhaps not as funny in the riffing department.  But the skeleton of the format for later seasons (invention exchange, interaction between Joel and the Mads) show the potential they would later realize oh so well.

Extras?  Interviews with Mamie Van Doren herself,  a grand lady and a great sport.  Somehow Pumaman actor Walter G. Alton Jr. was located, and it's great to see some insight in this obscure, very popular MST3K episode.  Intros from Joel Hodgon, , and the usual mini posters (I really don't care for these, they never leave the DVD box or anything.)

I had no idea so many of these episodes would be preserved as well as they are, and it's amazing how many people (especially those who grew up never knowing the 1970s) appreciate the humor.

Of course...recommended!",1406160000,5,2418,4.935643564356436
5274423,3,B0096RC4X4,"It's always disappointing to buy something on the strength of a bouquet of five-star reviews, and then find yourself feeling cheated by the results. The measure of a five-star MST3K set would necessarily be one where you'd gladly buy all four individually, which I have yet to experience. Hence no 'verified purchase' for me here; I borrowed this from my local library. If I'd been delighted with all four discs, I would indeed have bought this [as I did the 25th Anniversary release]. Instead, this is what I found:

***UNTAMED YOUTH is largely enjoyable for the vivacious Mamie Van Doren, though the film is just a tedious story of penal power abuse. The best MST3K fodder is a movie that thinks it's better than it is, but this one doesn't try for much, and succeeds. Three stars says you can sit through it & even enjoy it -- pretty good for first-season MST3K, reasonably decent for any other year.

**HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN is slow going: a mediocre Italian production, worth seeing once, as is THE THING THAT COULDNT DIE. Two stars each for bits that do entertain but not sustain. HERCULES has a notable flash of happy brilliance when one character invokes Uranus -- a golden bone for comic riffing -- but mostly it flags for long dull droughts. THING I cannot recall anything about but I did make it through, therefore two stars instead of one. If I'd bought them, I'd be skipping around a lot.

Redeeming value is found in PUMAMAN, which is hilariously bad as only a 1970s superhero film can be: action slacks, bad SFX, stoopid scripting, terrible theme ... and yet including the deliciously evil Donald Pleasence [Halloween 2]. Worth seeing not just once but many times, for there simply is no lack of comic material, and the MST3K gang tackle it with enthusiasm. This I would buy, and buy twice in case the first disc got lost. Four or even five-star MST'ing, on equal footing with POD PEOPLE or TIME CHASERS",1404950400,3,1927,4.678466076696165

An American rock 'n' roll star who recorded some of the most rocking songs of the '50's. He was born in Minnesota and has been inducted into the rock 'n' roll Hall of Fame. He died at a young age in a car crash.

I do my own rating system from One to Ten. - And I did this movie by movie - then average them for an overall rating for each particular set.

Untamed Youth: Black & white with Joel, Trace & J. Elvis (I.E. the 1st season).
The bonuses on this disc are cool - but very short. A (one-sided) interview with Mamie Van Doran and Joel 'Riffing himself'. A late 50's film about young people being scammed in cotton country by the law - forced to work the fields. The story is kind of flat - I only chuckled a few times (Not a big fan of the 1st season). Rating 2

Hercules and the Captive Women: Color with Joel, Trace & Kevin.
I didn't enjoy it much - until about 55 minutes into the movie. I had a few laughs - but it didn't knock my socks off.
Rating 3.

The Thing That Wouldn't Die: Black & White with Mike, Kevin, Bill and Pearl (I just Don't like her!)
About a desolate farm and water dowsing and a disembodied head. The movie is just okay - but the Riffs are very good (esp compared to the other 3 films in this set). I really had some good laughs!! Rating 7.

The Pumaman: Color with Mike, Kevin, Bill and Pearl (again - I Never like her).
The movie and especially the Riffs seemed to get better as it went along - but not so much in the last half hour. Sometimes it's a bit confusing as to which one the 'hero' is - and the golden mask makes No sense to me. Oh - and this 'hero' flies sort of like Superman - but with his legs hanging down - and at about 3 MPH. Rating 5.

This is the 1st MST3K box set - WithOut ANY Shorts. Perhaps they ran out of them??

5274438,5,B0096RC4X4,"I have all the box sets and several of the individual movies.  Never has a program taken something so bad and make it so good.  I am a big fan of MST3K

This set has a couple of particularly bad smelling additions.  MST3K movies are judged by using Manos, Hands of Fate, as the benchmark for wretchedness.  These movies, while bad, do not approach that (thank goodness).

The one standout is Untamed Youth.  The movie, is of course, horrible.  The only saving grace is that Les Baxter did the music.  And even some of the songs here are pretty bad - which is unusual for him.  Never heard of Les Baxter?  Amazon has a collection of his.  And he can be heard on Public Radio on the Retro Cocktail Hour.

Hercules and the Captive Women, The Thing That Couldn't Die and The Pumaman are only watchable in the MST3K form.

The specials in this set are pretty darn good too.  I particularly like the interview  with Steve Vance, who does the posters as well as a segment that shows those posters.

So, go ahead, grab this set and enjoy bad movies and funny commentary.",1396569600,11,1062,4.391752577319588

5274440,5,B0096RC4X4,"The back of the box attempts to draw a line between MST3K and social media, calling the riffs the precursors of ""tweets"", and trading the MST3K tapes, to sharing videos on YouTube. The actual fact is that the riffing on these films was based on the audience participation that went along with midnight showings of ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.  The ROCKY HORROR fans gather in old theaters, calling out jokes to the movie screen, and acting out bits of the film onstage, just like Joel and the Bots do between scenes.  As much as gets bantered concerning the origins of film riffing, its odd people don't credit the ROCKY HORROR craze for this, especially since Rocky Horror was still popular in the late 80s when MST3K premiered.

Since other reviews pretty much summed up the films, I'll pay attention to the EXTRAS that come with this box set. One of the best reasons to buy the box sets, instead of watching the shows on the internet, is to watch the excellent contextual mini documentaries that SHOUT! creates for these box sets.

UNTAMED YOUTH  episode 112
This film is one of those late 50s rock and roll morality tales, with teens that get into trouble, from such delinquent behavior as swimming in your underwear. It stars Mamie Van Doren, a Marilyn Monroe look alike sex symbol. She's arrested for undie-swimming, and sentenced to this forced labor farm, where the teens dance to Eddie Cochran songs. I'm not a fan of season one, but by the end of that first year, they had obviously found their groove.
EXTRAS---This film has Joel introducing the film, along with another extra where Joel talks about his NEWEST project, Joel Hodgson's RIFFING MYSELF.  Joel has a one man multi-media show, where he gives his reflections on growing up, and all the different influences that lead to his creation of MST3K.  He's still doing the Cinematic Titanic, but this new project is just ""another way for me to sing for my supper.""  This DVD also includes an interview with Mamie Van Doren.  I almost didn't want to watch this, because there's nothing sadder than seeing an elderly woman (In her late 70s or early 80s), talk about what it was like to be a sex symbol. Except Mamie is STILL HOT.  She talks about meeting Howard Hughes, getting discovered, and what it was like to star in one of the first ROCK AND ROLL films that feathered a woman.  Let me say this--Mamie has a good surgeon.

HERCULES and the CAPTIVE WOMEN  episode 412
I always felt that the 3rd and 4th seasons were the show's best.  Joel introduces the film again, saying how much Best Brains loved doing the Hercules films (they did four), because of the expensive production values.  This episode is famous coz Gypsy is in the theater. (Women are doin' it for themselves!) Of course she's bored stiff after five minutes, and leaves.  The film is OK. Hercules and his son Hymus get shipwrecked on Atlantis, there's an evil queen, a volcano, child sacrifice, and lots of nonsense.  One of my favorite bits tho, is when Crow reads this fake Bio about Hercules and his son Hymus' relationship. The extra for this film, is an interview with Steve Vance, the artist who creates the MST3K mini posters.  He shows you his process, and its interesting. The DVD also includes a slide show of every DVD cover he has created for the movies, since SHOUT! took over the franchise from Rhino five years ago.

The THING that COULDN'T DIE  episode 805
The last five box sets have been releasing all the episodes from the beginning of season 8, so expect more of this trend in box sets to come.  I've watched this episode a gazillion times, where a beautiful, innocent young woman who has a gift for discovering water, instead finds an ancient Treasure Chest, that contains a cursed head inside.  Add in a mystical amulet, greedy farmhands, a frustrated artist and unholy possession, and you've got yourself a typically predictable late 50s horror film. The 25 minute mini documentary that SHOUT! filmed for this episode, was very revealing about a period in the history of UNIVERAL PICTURES I was not aware of. In 1958 when this film was made, Universal was nearly bankrupt, so they made a lot of low budget films, with no name stars.  This film was cranked out in 2 weeks, and would have met with complete obscurity, except it was placed on a double bill with Hammer Dracula films.

PUMA MAN  episode 209
Puma Man is a campy Italian superhero movie made in 1980, about a man who's related to extraterrestrial Aztec pumas. Or not. I don't want to spoil the amazing plot devices that make Puma Man such a cinematic joy.  Suffice it to say, some Mexican Axtec informs this average guy, that he has the spirit of the Puma in him. Everything about this film is just plain weird, like the jerky, bent over way Puma Man flies, if you can call it that. The extra for this DVD is a rather long interview with the actor who created the roll of the Puma Man, an ex-NYC lawyer who capitalized on his good looks and athletic build, to make films.  In his interview he found the MST3K treatment of Puma Man to be way too nasty for his taste. Apparently it was the comments Crow made on the way Puma man flew, that got to him. Walter Alton Jr. went to great lengths to defend Puma Man's flying technic, explaining it was the director's fault, and how uncomfortable the flying rigging was. He apparently feels he needs to defend himself.(As tho his acting were on trial. Bad idea with a lawyer.) Once more we are treated to the back story behind the making of the movie, including antidotes about Donald Pleasant, who also stars in the film. This DVD includes the UN-RIFFED version of the movie, which some people might enjoy. The other extra with this DVD is a little 3 minute piece about the making of the NANITES.  When SCIFI took over MST3K for season 8, the writers decided more puppets were needed, so the nanites were created.  These microscopic robots could do all sorts of weird things on the Satellite of Love, like give Mike a 70 mile tall hair do.  It was cool to see how the nanites were built, and what they looked like actual size.

That sums up the extras on MST3K box set #29.  Its more of a four and a half star box set, certainly not up to the excellent standards of the 25th anniversary edition.  However, number 29 has fun movies, interesting mini documentaries providing a historical and sociological context for how, when and why these films were made, and some personal perspectives from our Best Brain buddies. Throw in the traditional MST3K mini movie posters, comic animated menus, and a few movie trailers, and you're left with a box set worth the bucks.",1395964800,7,6617,4.604255319148936

5274442,4,B0096RC4X4,"MST3K Volume XXV from Shout Factory is another good installment in their series releases. It pains me to give any MST3K set less than five stars, but I did this time as the choice of material is obviously dwindling as fewer episodes remain unreleased. None of the four episodes in this set are among the best the series offered: two are quite strong (""Robot Holocaust"" and ""Operation Kid Brother"",) two I find much more trying (""Kitten With A Whip"" and ""Revenge of the Creature. "") Obviously different people have different favorite episodes and I am in no way discouraging anyone from buying or watching this set. Every MST3K set is worth watching, I'm simply not as fond of the underlying material here as in most other sets. Now that I have said that, the riffing and host segments are excellent throughout all these episodes and Shout has again done a great job with extras, with introductions from Joel and Mike and ""Life After MST3K"" with Bill Corbett and J. Elvis Weinstein being especially notable.

""Robot Holocaust"" is far and away my favorite of the set (I actually saved it to watch last) and features atrocious acting and ridiculous robots with a plodding post-apocalyptic plot involving an evil leader (""The Dark One"") and some rebels dueling with robots of various degrees of hilarity. This is great 1980s low-budget sci-fi schlock.

I also liked ""Operation Kid Brother"" as it featured Sean Connery's little brother Neil overtly trying to step into the master spy genre with terrible results. Obviously there's a ludicrous plot to take over the world, and equally terrible acting and production values to go hand in hand to make this a howler with great host segments (watch for a Torgo cameo!)

""Kitten With A Whip"" is my least favorite film in the set (and is primarily responsible for the four star rating.) The riffing and host segments are fine, but the film is a typically boring juvenile delinquent film starring Ann-Margret and John Forsythe. Every JD stereotype is present, and the plot is among the most predictable in movie history. I don't especially like JD movies to begin with, but for me this one just drags, and I consider it among the least enjoyable of all MST3K episodes. Again, different people like different things, and if you like JD flicks, you will no doubt love the MST3K treatment meted out here. I watched this one first to get it over with.

""Revenge of the Creature"" is a rushed ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" sequel that stars John Agar. It is most famous of course for featuring a very young Clint Eastwood in what is clearly the highlight of the film. I like the dumb monster movies as much as anyone but have to admit this is not a favorite as it has an oft-repeated theme of monster and girl. It's an enjoyable episode but not among the best of the series either.

This is a good set, though not as great as some of the other Shout Factory sets. The extras are excellent, and I am sure I will revisit all these episodes (except ""Kitten With A Whip"") again in the future on multiple occasions. I recommend this set to any MST3K fan, but if you are new to the show this is not the set to start with.",1389484800,3,3150,4.627906976744186

5274445,5,B0096RC4X4,"I haven't seen the early two episodes and ""The Thing That Couldn't Die"" is a dreadfully dull movie (great riffing aside), but the key to this release and the reason I will so totally buy it is that it contains PUMAMAN!

""PumaMan"" is one of my favorite MST eps and truly a unique entry in the cannon.  There have been plenty of terrible super hero movies released over the years but I don't think MST has ever gotten to do any of them besides this gloriously inept feature!

How gloriously inept is PumaMan?  Well, you know how in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B003GMMXEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Movie</a>&nbsp;they used backwards projection, cables, and good camera angles to convincingly make Christopher Reeves look like he's flying?  They try the same thing in PumaMan except the filmmakers don't try to match ANY backwards projection shots and apparently use only one cable attached to the back of the actors belt so the effect isn't the actor flying so much as randomly tumbling through the air, flailing wildly with his butt in the air.  Or sometimes they don't use a cable at all and just have him *walk* accross the backwards projection screen.  Once you see how PumaMan flies you will *never ever* forget it!

PumaMan's superhero outfit is just tan slacks, penny loafers, a black shirt with a gold sparkly mask on it and a cape the size of a medium towel tied around his neck.  He wears no mask or disquise on his face whatsoever.  His theme music sounds like a supermarket jingle and the soundtrack primarily plays this rousing theme on a harpsichord!

The Aztec high priest who helped PumaMan discover his powers did so by randomly throwing him out a three story window (good thing the priest didn't have too many false leads before he found this guy!).  The high priest also does most of the good guy work, as PumaMan spends a good deal of his fight time goofily jumping around and not fighting the bad guys.

I could go on, but needless to say this film desperately screams for Mike and the Bots and they do an *incredible* job!  One of my favorite episodes and worth the price of the box by itself.  I'm so looking forward to having this one on great looking DVD transfer.",1387497600,63,2270,4.8903394255874675

This 1957 black-and-white film stars Mamie Van Doren and Lori Nelson as sisters arrested while hitchhiking in a rural town. A corrupt system sends them to a work farm where they are essentially used as slave labor. The movie also includes a brief appearance by early rocker Eddie Cochran (perhaps best known for Summertime Blues). This is one of the last episodes of Season 1 MST3K and it shows, the riffing is getting nice and dense and it's an enjoyable episode in spite of the lackluster drama of a film which has little to offer other than a few well-known cast members. This film is the first of many non-SF/horror films used on MST3K. Great host segments round out this enjoyable MST3K episode. With this episode Season 1 is now nearly complete on DVD with only the Black Scorpion remaining to be released.

412- HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN
This Italian 1961 color film stars body builder Reg Park. The terrific Gian Maria Volont (For A Few Dollars More, A Fistful Of Dollars) is also in this entertaining sword-and-sandal epic full of monsters and magic. Hercules must venture to Atlantis to rescue his son. It's worth watching just for the movie line, ""This day is dedicated to Uranus."" Needless to say, MST3K makes some great comedy out of this lively adventure film. Host segments include a Hercules action figure and the history of Hercules presented by Crow. A highly enjoyable episode.

805- THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE
A 1958 black-and-white ""horror"" film about a psychic young woman who discovers an ancient and evil undead head on her farm. Even for a fantasy horror film it's a ridiculous premise and the movie is ponderous and drab. Nevertheless, the crew of the SOL have some fun with it and there are some entertaining host segments to break up the film. This is the fifth episode of the show to appear on the Sci-Fi Channel after it was canceled on Comedy Central.

903- THE PUMAMAN
Pumaman (aka Puma Man) is a low-budget Italian film starring no one except inexplicably, Donald Pleasance. An Aztec shaman (Miguel Angel Fuentes) gives a mystical medallion to a young man who then becomes flying super-hero Pumaman. Comedy ensues though it's not always clear if it's intentional or not. A fair amount of the movie was shot in the UK. This movie seems a lot like Greatest American Hero, but the movie was actually released about a year before that show went on the air. It's an incredibly goofy movie. Host segments include Shelli The Nanite messing with Mike Nelson's hair. A fun episode.

Extra features include:
- A new interview with Untamed Youth star Mamie Van Doren
- A new interview with Walter G. Alton, Jr., star of The Pumaman

But then I got the joke and now I love to watch these old campy movies with very clever (and cheeky) minute by minute commentary from the peanut gallery sitting in the front.

The writers are witty and the sub-plot with Pearl and her apes having taken over the world and forcing Mike and his robots to watch cheesy movies is the most campy of all.  Thanks to MST3K for bringing back these old Saturday afternoon movies that I watched as a kid, hiding behind a chair.  They've given them a second life from a fresh viewpoint that makes my husband and I laugh whenever we watch them.

My daughter liked it so much she designed a black paper copy of Mike's crew and put it on the bottom of the TV screen as her own commentary whenever we watched a really bad movie.",1366675200,2,922,4.215909090909091

5274463,4,B0096RC4X4,"This marks the very first time I did NOT buy the newest MST3k volume on good ol' Amazon.  For some reason, Amazon never offered it lower than fifty bucks (unless I missed a pre-order special or something)!  Usually I go to Amazon because they're very competitive with their pricing, yet for this volume even Best Buy's NORMAL price was (and at the time of writing this, still is) lower.  What's up with that, Amazon?  I managed to grab a copy for a great price on a certain well known internet auction site.  Shame to have to take my business there when I prefer Amazon, but I'm not a rich man and paying ten bucks an episode for this show is costly enough without the price going up any higher.

Enough of my ranting, how is this set?  Pretty good!  Here's my episode by episode breakdown:

ROBOT HOLOCAUST:  This season one entry is probably the best episode I've seen of that season thus far.  After a rather pointless (though thankfully cut short) segment of Commando Cody, we're treated to a movie from the mid 80's that was used on MST3k only a few years later, ROBOT HOLOCAUST tells the tale of a plucky, mismatched gang of post-apocalypse character cliches and their travels to ""the Power Station"" to take on ""the Dark One"" who apparently rules the area after ""the robot holocaust in '33"" knocked humanity off their perch as rulers of the planet.  Aiding the Dark One is Valaria, one of the funniest movie villians ever to grace an MST episode.  I assume the girl playing Valaria was a European super model who tried to break into the acting world without any actual acting training or experience.  Valaria, beautiful though she is, talks in a truly ridiculous accent, sounding like the girl from that ""Wharwilf"" episode doing a Chirstopher Walken impression.  Its hilarious, and they give her SO MUCH screen time!  As for the rest of the movie, well, post-apocalyptic movies are tough to pull off as it is, and when you have a non-existant budget its even harder to make everything look like its past the end of the world as we know it (though Six String Samurai did a pretty good job on just $2 mil).  So what you get is guys in robot halloween masks with unmoving mouths and lots of people in fur daipers running around in abandoned factories.  Hilariously enough, most of the outdoor scenes seem to be shot in Central Park with the NY skyline in full view in the background (the twin towers are visible in many of these shots, as apparently the robot forces went a bit easier on the US than Al-Qaeda did).  The riffing is very good for season one, and the movie itself is such a riot its a very memorable episode.

Bonus features on this disc include an episode intro by Joel, where he unfortunately spends most of his time describing the invention exchange.  Its too bad, as I really wanted more of his thoughts on the movie.  You also get another ""Life After MST3k"" segment, this time with J. Elvis Weinstein, season one's Tom Servo.  In what is a punishingly long segment (almost 20 minutes!) we find out he moved to L.A. after wrapping up on season one of MST, then bounced around from failed TV show to failed TV show (seriously, its like one a year), and is now on Cinematic Titanic with Joel, Trace, Mary Jo, and Frank.  He comes off as a completely self-absorbed B-hole, is generally thankless, negative and critical of all the shows he was involved with, and by the time he said he'd never want to work FOR Joel again, but is happy to work WITH him on CT, I wanted to punch my TV.  Most of the gang from Best Brains seem like pretty nice people, this guy is not one of them.

OPERATION KID BROTHER (actually OPERATION DOUBLE 007):  Italian rip-off of James Bond starring Sean Connery's brother Neil!  While hardly competition with the actual bond films Sean Connery was in, this movie is strange enough to make for a very entertaining episode.  Knowing they can't really compete with Bond flicks, the film-makers try to compensate with a nice score by Ennio Morricone and by filling the movie wall-to-wall with hot chicks.  Those who have any familiarity with Italian B-movie film-making probably know that these movies usually don't even try to make sense and this one is no exception, so a more in-depth plot summary is pointless, but rest assured the movie is very weird.  I could get into examples of the weirdness, but its more fun if you're surprised.  The final showdown with Neil and the villian is hilarious.  The riffing throughout is very strong as well, and the flick is such a unique offering that it makes for another very memorable episode.

Bonus features here are just an episode intro by Joel, which focuses mostly on the film as he recalls some of his favorite moments and why the film makes for a good MST episode.

KITTEN WITH A WHIP:  Another very odd entry in the MST cannon, KWAW has Ann Margret playing Jodi, an escaped juvinile delinquent who takes residence at a politicians house.  He helps her out and she goes bat-crap crazy and victimizes him repeatedly, exploiting both his good heart and the danger his political career would be in if word got out that he was harboring an underage teen hottie in his house while his wife was away.  Things go from bad to worse when she invites friends over who are just as nuts and abusive as she is.  The movie is done reasonably well, so much so that I can see some viewers actually getting into the depressing story a bit and feeling bad for John Forsythe's character, ultimately making for an MST episode that bums them out instead of making them laugh.  I, on the other hand, found it to be pretty hilarious given the sheer stupidity of the goings-on.  I mean, how often can Forsythe's David continually buy into Jodi saying that she ""really means it this time"" and do something for her only to be further buried in trouble?  And if he knows she escaped from a juvenile detention center after trying to burn the place down and stabbing a nurse on the way out, who CARES what she'll say if he calls the cops? Its her word against his, and I think any given authority figure will take his word over that of someone with arson and attempted murder on their rap sheet!  Take the idiotic plot, add in the goofy, non-stop beatnick slang of the script, the super over-the-top performance from Margret, and some great riffing and you have another very memorable, very unique MST episode.  Also, Kevin Murphy's role as the actual Kitten with a Whip in one of the host segments was hysterical, he really nails some your typical cat mannerisms.

This disc's lone extra is just a short intro by Mike Nelson, where he acknowledges that this movie was not your typical MST3k type movie, and thought that they probably put a little more into the host segments as a way of compensating.  I think he's a little too hard on it, but he's often somewhat self critical in the interviews I've seen.

REVENGE OF THE CREATURE:  This rushed-out sequel to ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" is a bit more typical of an MST3k movie than the other three on this set.  That said, its a hilarious episode.  The creature gets captured from the Amazon river and is taken to a Florida aquarium where he's put on display for tourists.  John Agar and his shrinkwrapped batch try to train him and, of course, he gets out, kidnaps the girl and goes on a rampage.  Slightly better than most of the sci-fi clunkers that make the show, the movie is very riffable and, with this being the gangs very first episode for the Sci-Fi channel, you can tell some extra effort was put in to make it as funny as possible.  Another very good episode.

Extras on this disc include another episode intro by Mike Nelson, where he's somewhat apologetic about the movie restrictions the Sci-Fi channel had put on the show, as well as the efforts they made the crew go through to tell a story.  Again, I think he's being a tad too critical, but its still very interesting to hear his thoughts.  You also get ""Jack Arnold at Universal"" a short documentary on the ""Revenge of the Creature"" director and the interesting work he did as a film-maker.  Pretty interesting how different movie making was in those days.  Lastly we have another ""Life After MST3k"" with Bill Corbett, who played the Sci-Fi era's Crow and Observer.  He's way more likable than J. Elvis Weinstein was and seems to be much more humble and appreciative of the work he's done.  He's doing Rifftrax with Kevin Murphy and Mike Nelson now.  Funny how all those guys kinda came full circle and are now back into the movie riffing game.  Not that I'm complaining, I love their new work too.

So there you have it, a new volume and all the episodes, while not anything that will challenge my list of top 20 episodes, are very good, entertaining episodes.  This volume is an easy addition to any fan's library, and not a bad set to lend the MST3k newcomer either.  Pick it up, you'll be happy you did.",1358812800,13,8900,4.54676710608914
5274464,5,B0096RC4X4,"Like anyone else who loves the show, each box set is appreciated. Lets have a show of hands for who dreams Of a revival of this show?",1357430400,,133,3.962962962962963
5274465,1,B0096RC4X4,"I just learned that this item is RESTRICTED which means if you buy a copy you cannot sell it on Amazon. Only certain pre approved sellers may list this item.

I was extremely disappointing to learn this as I have been buying and selling things on Amazon for a long time.

Looks like I will have to purchase and sell elsewhere.",1356998400,2,326,4.327868852459017
5274466,5,B0096RC4X4,"Yeah, I'm not much of a fan of the old stuff, especially KTMA and season 1.  But the more I watch some of those really old episodes, the more I appreciate them for what they are, and that is certainly the case with Robot Holocaust, which for some reason includes no actual holocaustiness in it at all. I'd seen the actual movie (in a restored HD print, no less) on TV years ago and knew it was ripe for assault, but as with many of the older episodes the riffs don't fly quite right.  Still, there's plenty of MST3k charm in the early days and I cherish all the episodes from that era that get released.

My favourite in this box set is by far Revenge of the Creature, not just for the great reset to the storyline with Pearl but the insanely good riffing that occurs through the whole movie.  Operation 007/Kid Brother is good but not outstanding, and Kitten With A Whip is just, well, it's a hoot, plain and simple.  It's one of the many old movies I watch via MST3k and wonder, ""What would I do in that situation?""  If I caught a blonde babe in my daughter's bed, I'd probably just up and killer her first, THEN call the police.

But that would make for a short movie.",1356998400,3,1171,4.2242152466367715
5274467,2,B0096RC4X4,"MST3K Vol 25;
I offer a disc by disc break-down of my opinions of this set, followed by my overall rating.

Disc one, 'Robot Holicaust' (color) - An early episode with Joel, Trace & Josh. The best part of this movie - is the title (and that's it).
This disc starts with an ultra brief 'short' 'Comando Cody - Chapter 9' B+W) - so brief and if there is a point to it - I don't get it. The robots used in this film are Not the classic type bots - but really crappy ones. This 'stars' a very attractive woman who plays an evil charactor - who seems to slur her words. The movie is stupid and - I'm sorry - most of the riffs are lame.
On my scale of one to ten - I upped this one to a 1 1/2

Disc two, 'Operation kid brother' (color) Joel, Kevin & Trace - 'staring' Neil Connery - Sean's brother. An attempt at a bond-like movie - and falls short - or should I say never makes it. A few chuckles I got from the MST guys - the movie is stupid and unfortunate.
On my scale from one to ten - rating 3

Disc three, 'Kitten with a whip' (B+W) Mike,Kevin & Trace  - Staring Ann Margaret & John Forsythe. An intense movie - where a senator gets sucked into a troubled teens dramas - and his life and career are on the line. For the first time - I can not appreciate the 'riffing' - as the movie is too intense and disturbing for me to focus on the gags. I think there were some good riffs in here.
On my scale of one to ten - rating 4

Disc four, 'Revenge of the creature' (B+W) Mike, Kevin & Bill (First one with this line-up?) Early in the movie is a cameo of a young Client Eastwood. This 'creature' is just like the one from 'The black lagoon' - I found the first 3rd of this movie dragged - riffs and all, - then it kicks in - and some of the riffs really made me laugh. The movie got more interesting too. The bonus thing on this disc (so and so) in Universal is About him - he is NOT in this)
On my scale of one to ten - rating 7 (best disc of the set)

My overall rating of all four discs - this set - on a scale of one to ten is 3.87 or like 2.5 stars.

I'd love to see the 'Collosal Man' in a set - I hear the 'Painted hills' are funny too. Don't get me wrong - I love MST3K - just Not this set.

A cheap-looking work of 1980s science fiction, a 1960s Eurospy send-up, a star vehicle from a big Hollywood studio that has taken on a cult quality of its own, and a classic Fifties creature feature comprise the four films in Volume XXV:

ROBOT HOLOCAUST (1986, Episode 110).  This film is one people love or dont.  Although the viewer can clearly see an unharmed Midtown Manhattan in the background of most shots, its allegedly set in a future, post-apocalyptic New York City troubled by gangs, predatory robots, and 1980s hairstyles.  Plot devices borrow widely if not well from STAR WARS, ZARDOZ, the corpus of post-apocalyptic fiction, and even the 'Orgasmatron' in Woody Allen's futuristic satire SLEEPER. I do give credit to the movie for naming the male lead ""Neo"" a dozen years before THE MATRIX, but the female lead is barely understandable given her bad enunciation and pseudo-arch pronunciation.  The first color movie lampooned in a national broadcast of MST3K, it was preceded by the last Radar Men on the Moon short presented on the show.  ROBOT HOLOCAUST is a truly deficient bit of Eighties sci-fi that is redeemed through good riffing by Joel and the bots.

OPERATION KID BROTHER -- aka OPERATION DOUBLE 007 and O.K. CONNERY (1967, Episode 508).  Sean Connerys younger and less talented brother Neil heads up this derivative spy caper, made at the height of Seans JAMES BOND series of pictures.  To this day, opinions vary as to whether this Italo-Spanish production was meant as a spy spoof, or merely an exploitation flick.  As though to emphasize this film's knock-off quality, Lois Maxwell and Bernard Lee, already associated with the Bond franchise, appear here too (though in different roles). Contemporary film critic Bosley Crowther condemned the film as ""a wobbly carbon copy of the James Bond thrillers,"" though VARIETY noted that ""many viewers may find it hilarious fun.""  In all fairness, this movie exhales a mid-Sixties vibe almost in spite of itself.  In one of the host segments, Joel smugly demands a back rub in emulation of the movies lead character.  Can you imagine how Servo and Crow react to that?

KITTEN WITH A WHIP (1964, Episode 615).  I suspect lots of people are like me and bought this collection primarily for this early Ann-Margret movie -- Universal Pictures, which made it, has been grudging with the replay rights over the years and KITTEN can be difficult to come by whether plain or riffed.  An 84-minute-long vehicle for the title star, meant to showcase her acting chops after the fluffy VIVA LAS VEGAS, the film wanders uncomfortably between psychological thriller and plain old sexploitation, but is compelling nonetheless.  With John Forsythe as the overcautious political candidate who gets whipped all over the place by the title characters machinations.  In one of the host segments  Kevin Murphy (the voice of robot Tom Servo, among other characters) appears looking uncomfortable in a comic cat suit as the kitten -- he later explained that the unusual voice he affected was meant, unsuccessfully, to portray one of cartoon Top Cats outer-borough buddies.

REVENGE OF THE CREATURE (1955, Episode 801).  Not only a sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel, the highly successful CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, REVENGE was originally released in 3-D yet for all that, did well.  Even today it rates a middling 5.5 score at the Internet Movie Database, pretty good for this subgenre or the average MST3K movie, for that matter.  John Agar and Lori Nelson must hunt down the Gill-Man when he escapes from his lagoon.  Mystery Science Theater never got to show the original upon which this sequel was based, which is a pity.  But REVENGE is watchable either way.

So far, this is the only Roman Numeral Mistie compilation to which I've given four stars rather than five.  But since KITTEN WITH A WHIP is a coveted pleasure, albeit a bit of a guilty one, this Volume XXV, in my opinion, is worth buying anyway.  The fact that neither KITTEN nor REVENGE OF THE CREATURE is available streaming from Amazon may provide a further inducement to buy.
