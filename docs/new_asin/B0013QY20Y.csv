IT SMACKS OF THE OLD SHELL GAME.............LAST MOVE BEING ""GOTCHA' !!!!!!!!!!!  SO BUYER BEWARE.",1283472000,,355,5.0
8252664,5,B0013QY20Y,"do yourself a favor, go buy a region free & PAL compatible dvd player and watch the entire series... twice.  This show is so funny, the characters are crazy and insane, and somehow very normal, just like you and me.  I ordered this thinking I was only going to get seasons 1 - 4, but it had 1 - 5!  I don't know why the world just doesn't make and sell region free NTSC & PAL compatible dvd players by default.  I know people in the US would love this show if they had the ability to see it on NTSC dvds.

best show ever! (besides Arrested Development)",1258848000,2,552,4.074074074074074
8252665,5,B0013QY20Y,This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. No laugh track (it doesn't need one). Moral-majority types may be offended by some of the humor.,1257724800,,146,4.444444444444445
8252666,5,B0013QY20Y,"I have just watched the complete boxset, series 0ne through five for the third time In the last month. It is absolutly brilliant, the stories and comedy are so fresh and interesting. mark and jeremy are odd but in a good way. the way they handle life's quirky situations never gets old.  they love and hate each other in the same breath. they are complex in there ideas but understand each other more than even themselves.  Bottom line very funny show I hope never ends.
I bought a region free DVD player just to watch this great show!!",1235520000,5,536,4.459183673469388
