1173008,5,9089709894,"I am posting a review for the Fireplace Jazz Dvd. This is a nice dvd and is the perfect backdrop for enjoying with
firends, family, or that significant other in your life.

The first selection with different options is Jazz Fireplace XL, which allows you to have just the fireplace scene with logs crackling, or with smooth Jazz sounds, or a combination of both .

I liked the music only option, would be nice for a romantic dinner, piano music and saxophone go well with the display of the fireplace.

Next choice is Small wood fire, which again gives you the option fireplace alone, or with music, or a combo of both. The music on this choice was upbeat with piano, percussion, and saxophone.

I really would recommend this for a quiet evening , relaxing and enjoying the company of a loved one.",1417564800,,797,4.5524475524475525
1173009,5,9089709894,"Talk about setting a mood instantly! Ambient DVD's are always a great way of opening a window on the world but this DVD is so different. Use it when you come home from a long and tiring day as I do or when you have a date or treat your partner to a loving night in. This is so effortless! Love the music selection as well, it is so cool. But the nice thing for the DVD is that you can just use it for the fire and the crackles! That way it is of dual use, romantic or the ultimate fireplace DVD spending an evening with friends or a good book... The 40 minutes fire is particularly good and we loved the price too. Well recommended.",1403568000,,632,3.984251968503937
1173010,5,9089709894,"f only these were available when I was a bachelor! This is a very romantic DVD, with a choice of two fires (one larger, one small) that burn down to the embers. You have a choice of listening to a wonderful score of romantic jazz, or, if you like, to nothing but the natural sounds of the fireplace. This DVD would be excellent background for an intimate setting. But it doesnt have to be just background: theres something fascinating about watching a fire burn down to glowing embers even if you're alone. Your thoughts seem to follow the action. What I mean is, watching a fire burn down for an extended period of time (over 40 minutes on the first selection) can a meditative experience, at the end of which you feel calm. Ive watched this DVD both wayswith the sexy jazz score, and with only the sounds of the crackling fire---and each has its merits. The music, as I say, is romantic and relaxing, and would be nice to have around on a date. But the unadorned sounds of the wood crackling is also very relaxing. So, if you're wondering why someone would want to sit in front of the screen and watch a fire burn itself out for over an hour---either listening to a romantic score, or simply the sounds of wood crackling---its because by the end of the DVD you feel as if something in your mind has been resolved. Once again, the patient production values of the Ambient Collection have cast their spell on a too-busy world.",1403481600,3,1426,4.467432950191571

7901627,2,9089709894,"It's just a fire on a black background. You can't see the inside of the fireplace as it showed in the photo, so it just looks like a fire suspended in midair without any base. I don't get the sense of looking at a real fire, like I did with the Xfinity On Demand Yule Log video that plays around Christmas, but goes away after New Years.
It just doesn't make you feel like you're looking at a fireplace.
I'm not crazy about the music either, but that's easily remedied by turning their music off and leaving fire sounds only and then playing your own music.",1484179200,,557,4.264150943396227

7901632,5,9089709894,"There are two fireplaces to choose from.  Each fireplace has smooth jazz and the music is different with each fireplace so you can choose the one you like best.  Very realistic and well made.  Good sound, good video.  Very professional.  I love it.",1446681600,2,248,4.674418604651163
7901633,5,9089709894,"This DVD has two firesides with jazz music. I especially like that you can watch the entire fire. This way you have the feeling to watch a real log fire. The image quality is also very good. When it comes to background noise, you have the choice to enjoy the fire with jazz music, just the crackling of the fire or a mix of both. Although I am not a big fan of jazz music, I really like the combination of the firesides with the music. The music fits perfectly with the slightly faster flickering of the fire. This DVD is fantastic for a cozy evening at home.",1441497600,,559,4.185185185185185
7901634,5,9089709894,The DVD shipped very quickly and got here in time for Christmas.  I was very impressed with the high quality of the media.  I would definitely recommend it to others.,1420416000,,166,4.5
7901635,5,9089709894,"OK, I'm not much of a jazz music fan, so when I got this, I was dubious whether I'd like it. But I figured I'd try it out and mute it if the music was the frenetic kind of jazz I've heard before and didn't like, because I love fireplace videos. Imagine my surprise when I LOVED the sultry mood-setting music that came out of my TV. I was TOTALLY shocked that I had misjudged the music just because it's ""jazz"". The fires are, as always, mesmerizing. I watch these videos a lot in the winter especially. I love to watch the fires burn all the way down. Since you can listen to the fire crackling too, it's definitely a relaxing, versatile video.  I'm SO glad I have this DVD. Try it, I'm sure you'll like it too!! Its very affordable too!",1418601600,,737,4.190140845070423
