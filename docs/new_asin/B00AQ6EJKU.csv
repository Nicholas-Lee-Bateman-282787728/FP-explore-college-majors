5469281,5,B00AQ6EJKU,This my second of The Cotswold Villages. I just love them. Next I think I will get the Ireland one. I put the dvd in my computer and walk in place. I get a lot of steps in that way.,1457308800,2,181,3.55

5469283,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"This is a helpful little thing! I love watching - it's pretty mindless, so the fact it's on a loop doesn't really matter. I've even given the people who walk by names and call out hello when I pass them repeatedly.  If it's gets me on the treadmill, it's worth it! I also have Rome, Singapore and national parks.  Different strokes, folks!!",1433030400,7,340,4.467741935483871
5469284,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"Got this DVD - and it's companion - to watch as I exercise on the treadmill.
They're wonderful!
The video is of a simple walk through some beautiful English villages - no dialog - no soundtrack - just the ambient sounds of a quiet walk in beautiful surroundings. Makes an hour on the treadmill seem like only a moment.",1417219200,17,318,4.406779661016949
5469285,5,B00AQ6EJKU,Great virtual walking video.  This is one of my favorites.  I wish I could actually walk through the Cotswolds.  What a beautiful place.  I can now get my exercise every day within my home.  I have several of these videos and can go different places to exercise.  They are wonderful.,1416960000,14,283,4.56
5469286,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"I purchased this to watch while riding a stationary bike.  The pace is more of a walk that a bike ride, but it is still very enjoyable.  You can hear the wind blowing and the birds singing as you go along.",1403136000,6,205,3.975609756097561
5469287,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"Having taken an all to short trip to Scotland, I wanted a way to enjoy the European country at my leisure.  This DVD fit the bill!  The locations are splendid.  In America when a building has outlived its' usefulness we tear it down.  In England they celebrate and revere it.  The photographic technique is unique giving the effect of walking, without all the jerking of the camera if it had been held on a shoulder.  Lighting is natural which probably took some advance planning to catch good weather.  The flora is ideal indicating a good selection of season.  Of course location, location, location, how could anything go wrong.  I was glad of the sounds of nature over some poorly selected musical background.  I appreciated the pauses to reflect on some special visual, and having the DVD of course allows one to pause it to peruse detail and grandeur.
I would recommend this DVD to any who want to use it for treadmill walking, but also just for enjoyment of someplace beautiful.",1401926400,16,985,4.707602339181286
5469288,2,B00AQ6EJKU,"I have a 42"" screen in front of my treadmill for the virtual walk experience.
Cotswold Villages Volumes 1 and 2 are fine for smaller screens, but when played on larger screens (like my 42"") the lack of high definition puts these DVDs too far out of focus for an enjoyable experience.",1401148800,11,283,4.461538461538462
8556111,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"I love this DVD when I'm in the mood to walk the English countryside. I somehow imagine the great house of Downton Abbey, or Brideshead, or some grand manor of English literature is somewhere lurking beyond the trees around the corner! While the maker can't make any such assertions due to copyright, this certainly reminds me of that place in time. There's such lovely aged cottages and rustic rural roads.  You might spot some horse poop, and sure enough, you will pass by the mounted equestrians.  Sure there are signs of present-day life as autos here & there, but I feel like it's the location of a beautiful Victorian/Edwardian romance novel or movie set location.  I like to pair it with my Downton Abbey soundtrack CD, combined with the natural birds & outdoor sounds on the video, one gets a total surround experience.  As a private owner using these in my private home gym, I can mix & match.  I've been using these DVDs for years with my Gazelle elliptical/walking device, and I never get bored. The companion Cotswold Vol 1 is an equal winner. Get both Cotswold Villages Vol 1& 2 as you won't want your journey to end.",1490659200,,1130,4.63
8556112,2,B00AQ6EJKU,"The wild camera swings make this unusable for me as a treadmill DVD.  While walking, the camera operator keeps panning the camera around to look in different directions, walking themselves into rosebushes or parked cars, or suddenly walking sideways or backwards, and it's really disorienting.  The constant stops are annoying, as is the bounce in the camera operator's step making the foreground bob up and down.  However, while I'm watching this on my big screen while on the treadmill, the camera swings are actually a bit dangerous when the camera is suddenly going a very different direction from my treadmill, and my body wants to react by changing course...  It's a shame since these villages are awfully cute, of course.  I'll be avoiding VITA's other DVDs.",1485734400,2,765,5.0396825396825395
8556113,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"Not too exciting, but a very calm walk through a pretty town",1484006400,,60,4.083333333333333
8556114,5,B00AQ6EJKU,These videos are gorgeous and help break the monotony of the treadmill.  I actually have put them on while I'm working around the house so they are just playing in the background.,1482969600,,179,4.59375
8556115,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"I put a TV on my treadmill and now I watch these videos while exercising.
It makes the time pass much faster and not near as tired when I'm finished.",1482624000,,149,4.0

8556119,5,B00AQ6EJKU,This is a great video! Well done like you are actually walking through the villages! Even see other people smiling at you. Sure beats watching the news while your are on a treadmill . Very nice!,1463097600,,194,4.416666666666667
8556120,5,B00AQ6EJKU,"they did a wonderful job on this one, it is relaxing and beautiful. I use it for my treadmill, my husband for his bike. I get so caught up in the beauty of the walk my morning workout is finished before I know it.",1461456000,2,213,3.8636363636363638
