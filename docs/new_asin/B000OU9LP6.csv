8186756,5,B000OU9LP6,"Sadly, most people who consider themselves ""fans"" of the Rock genre, no nothing about the Smile project or how it came so close to being the album that changed the game in pop music in the mid 1960's. When Brian recorded Good Vibrations, he had the whole music world baffled as to how he did it, and at that moment he was the top dog in the recording business, even over The Beatles.

Based on the brilliance of Good Vibrations, people, mostly within the music business, couldn't wait for the Smile album to be released. It's was scheduled for a January 1967 release, six months before Sgt. Pepper. Had it actually been released on time, Sgt. Pepper would have been just another collection of great Beatles music. Smile, conceived as a double album, was a three movement rock opera so complex and sophisticated musically and lyrically, that it would have been a game changer in the way music was conceived and produced.

Many factors delayed the album to the point of it being shelved all together, leaving the world wondering ""what if?"" Some argue it was too ahead of it's time. Finally, the whole story is told here by the people who were there to witness a true genius creating his most beautiful masterpiece, sadly to have it slowly destroy him and send him into hiding for years to come.",1399766400,,1292,4.613043478260869
8186757,4,B000OU9LP6,"The makers took an interesting and productive approach by spending a lot of time interviewing the friends and colleagues of Brian Wilson during the time he was working on ""Smile.""  Many of these people are relatively unknown, but their insights and descriptions allow us to see what Wilson was doing during this important moment in his creative life.  I also enjoyed seeing how his band mates helped him make it through the live debut of ""Smile"" in London.  Docked one star for the absence of even a single voice offering any slight disagreement with the idea that ""Smile"" was Brian's creative peak.  Even those who believe it was ought to be able to acknowledge there are reasonable people who think otherwise.  Very worth seeing, nevertheless, if you're a Beach Boys fan, or if you've ever wondered what the fuss was all about when it came to ""Smile.""",1310601600,4,853,4.775510204081633
