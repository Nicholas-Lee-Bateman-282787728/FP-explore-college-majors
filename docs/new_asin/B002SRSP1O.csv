8379543,5,B002SRSP1O,"I bought this pack after nearly buying the DVDs separate.  I was afraid it would only be trial versions because this pack costs the same as a single DVD.  It is not a trial pack it is was AWESOME!  My 2 year old picked up telling time very quickly, he learned 2 new shapes (he already knew the others),and he is starting to get counting money a little and is enjoying a reward system of coins in a piggy bank.  Every time he earns coins we go over what each one is and how much they are worth.  Theses are great and he loves them.  This is definitely geared toward younger children and I find that limiting how much TV he watches is instrumental in this type of instruction and presentation to be entertaining and effective.",1332374400,,724,4.286764705882353
