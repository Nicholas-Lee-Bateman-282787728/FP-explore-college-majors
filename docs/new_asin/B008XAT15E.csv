5188577,4,B008XAT15E,Billy Bathgate has long been one of my favorite movies about the old gangster era. Blaze has always made me wonder why Paul Newman chose to be in the movie.,1360713600,,156,4.233333333333333
5188578,4,B008XAT15E,I like the movies but this Blu-ray was selling in walmart for 5 dollars so by not being patient I missed out on a better deal but still am happy with my purchase.,1360713600,,162,3.9393939393939394

5188580,5,B008XAT15E,Finally have Blaze in an affordable format.  Blu-ray is adequate and clear even though their are some specks and dirt from time to time.  And to get Billy Bathgate too is a plus.  Great buy!,1357171200,,190,4.371428571428571
5188581,5,B008XAT15E,"Mill Creek does it again, this time with two thrillers, BOTH of these are R
Both are in thier original widescreen ratios, and have optional english captions.

The PQ and AQ are great with this release.

Billy Bathgate stars Dustin Hoffman, Bruce Willis, and Nicole Kidman

Blaze stars Paul Newman and Lolita Davidovich.

Mill Creek is really releasing some stellar products lately!
Recommended!",1356480000,,394,5.2063492063492065
5188582,3,B008XAT15E,I was surprised both movies fit on a single blu-ray disk. The picture quality doesn't seem to be better than DVD quality. There were no extras--at least with Billy Bathgate. I haven't watched Blaze yet. Overall it was a decent value,1354147200,4,232,4.682926829268292

5188585,5,B008XAT15E,I never knew that Dustin Hoffman was a gangster!  And that Bruce Willis had hair!  (Just kidding!)  Did Paul Newman ever make a bad film?  Two solid movies at a great price!  What's not to like?,1416009600,,194,4.277777777777778

5188591,3,B008XAT15E,"Both of these movies are true stories. I gave this CD three stars, because I didn't like the movie Billy Bathgate. I do love the movie Blaze and to see the real Blaze Starr in the movie is wonderful. Blaze left home at an early age, she was only in her middle teens. She had hopes of becoming a singer. She was working in a donut shop when a man came in and got into becoming a stripper.  She was working at this one club when she met the governor of La. There was big age difference between the two of them, but they fell in love. They really loved each other. The people around the governor tried everything to stop he found seeing her. I love this movie. I found myself laughing a lot.",1389657600,,688,4.0962962962962965
5188592,4,B008XAT15E,"These two films share several aspects. Neither was a hugh success, both were made by Touchstone back when making films meant for an adult audience was something new to Disney, both have casts that include in major roles both big name and relatively unknown performers, and both deal with 'small' people swept into the world of the large and famous. Too, both deal (albeit a bit loosely) with historical charactors and events.

They also IMO share a quiet excellence.

""Blaze"" is the story of stripper Blaze Starr and her relationship with Louisiana Governer Earl Long. ""Billy Bathgate"" with the entirely fictional Billy interjected into the historical misdoings of NY 1930s gangster Dutch Schultz.

Good films both. Recommended.",1386288000,,728,5.205128205128205
5188593,4,B008XAT15E,Both movies are better than average and worth twice the price.  A couple of brief revealing images of Nicole Kidman prove she is truly a gorgeous red-haired lady.,1373673600,,162,4.785714285714286
5188594,4,B008XAT15E,"Two uneven movies for me. Billy Bathgate is one of the better mob films about the 30s but Blaze dragged and was just not to my taste.
The transfers are good but basic, the main problem I found was the subtitles which are all upper case and harder to read. No extras at all. The price is cheap however and therefore a great buy for Billy Bathgate alone.",1365638400,,352,4.1911764705882355

8531747,4,B008XAT15E,"I bought this to watch Blaze on blu-ray. I didn't really care about Billy Bathgate. I had never seen either of them though I remember seeing their VHS covers at Blockbuster when I was a child. I passed by them and thought, ""Hmmm...I wonder what that one's about."" 20 years later, I'm finally watching them and on blu-ray-- the best way to watch them. Blaze is a delightful, fun film to watch with a poignant ending. Billy Bathgate doesn't live up to 5 stars, but its actually a very interesting story and interesting to see Dustin Hoffman as a cold-blooded, desperate gangster.",1421280000,,577,4.666666666666667
