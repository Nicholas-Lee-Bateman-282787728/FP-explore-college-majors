8260798,1,B00164E6H2,"This is my first time writing a review I believe. I normally do not write them but I feel compelled to do so due to this movie being so horrible. I don't want anyone to waste their time and money as my mom did when she bought it from a store. Looking at the cover and reading the plot, it appears, I repeat, APPEARS to be a good movie. I was thinking more along the lines of Tyler Perry but maybe without the comedy. I was wrong. The picture was horrible. It looks like a kid filmed it. The ending was stupid and the acting was not convincing. In fact the story of the characters were too unbelievable. My advice for the producer of this film, he or she should have spent more money in the actual film and not the cover as the cover looks professional. But I guess even they realize it was not worth putting an extra dime into the film. What a huge flop!",1248825600,5,854,4.089285714285714
