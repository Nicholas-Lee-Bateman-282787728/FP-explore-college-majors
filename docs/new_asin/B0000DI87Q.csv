8001094,5,B0000DI87Q,"El dvd no es demasiado educativo, pero ver a esta ""bestia"" tocando las congas, es como ver los goles de Maradona en el 86.",1315440000,,122,4.125
8001095,1,B0000DI87Q,"Hildalgo has a strong accent which in and of itself is not a problem in relation to following his instruction. But, the back and forth Spanish to English approach with sub-titles makes the DVD laborious to follow. This DVD would have been better coming in separate English and Spanish versions.",1280016000,,294,4.9
8001096,5,B0000DI87Q,"This video is part instructional, part entertainment, and all worthwhile.  The instructional material is very basic, but unlike many conga instructional videos, is done to perfection.  You simply cannot find better material in terms of sound and execution.  Giovanni presents in both Spanish and English.  The latter part of the video is pure entertainment - basically studio music sessions, with the focus on the tumbadoras ... and Giovanni.  What he can do with his hands on a drumhead has to be seen to be believed.",1226016000,3,518,5.047058823529412
