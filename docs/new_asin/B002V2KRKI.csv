Although I do not usualy enjoy criminal themes, Jang Keun Suk represented his character perfectly, and his English is amazingly good. All the characters acted in a believable way.  I was so happy it was available on Amazon. Com. I have never been disappointed in any of JKS's movies, and I have tried to buy as many as possible.",1365638400,,379,4.478260869565218
8381713,5,B002V2KRKI,This was a departure for Jang Keun Suk to play a man with unfortunate circumstances. I look forward to more complex characters as he gains more life experience.,1362009600,,160,4.75
8381714,5,B002V2KRKI,Im not usually into murder case movies but this this one was really good.

I don't know even know why but for some reason this is ones intertaining and main actor jang geun suk the way he shows feeling in his eyes and gesters just made the movie for me. The subs in this one are perfect!,1353110400,2,402,3.9753086419753085
8381715,5,B002V2KRKI,I have  waited over a year to get this particularn movie on DVD.  I have seen Jang Guen Seok in various other movies and cannot help but think that this young man has so much talent.  He is the Korean reincarnation of Spencer Tracy.  This young man can sing as well as act.  His facial expressions alone capture the scene without words.  This movie is based on an actual event that happened in the Seoul suburb of Itaewon in the mid 90's.  The suspects were AmerAsian and this movie keeps you guessing.  I highly recommend this movies...2 Thums UP!!!,1351987200,,550,4.484848484848484
8381716,5,B002V2KRKI,"I originally heard about this story when I was stationed on Japan.  It was in the Stars and Stripes Newspaper.  I happened across the movie on a Website about JGS.  All I can say is that he is a great actor.  He tackled this role and made it his own.  JGS spoke in English through a majority of the movie.  This couldn't have been an easy task.  Besides him the rest of the cast did a great job.  Through the entire movie you feel yourself going back and forth about one is actually guilty.  Its one of those movies that has you watching it over and over and doing ""research"" on the internet to get more info about the actual crime!  Highly recommend especially because this case is still ongoing and South Korea has been trying to extradite the accused from the States to this day.",1325116800,,782,4.294520547945205
