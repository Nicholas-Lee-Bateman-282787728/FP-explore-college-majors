2993264,4,B000X0GWNG,"There have been a lot of movies where a prehistoric beast is thawed/discovered/created just so it can go around killing people but this one is different and more original than most.  After five years of study a frozen mammoth comes back to life after the museum is struck by a meteor.  But if you payed attention to the wonderful dancing cave paintings in the credits, you will have a better understanding of the alien involvement in this event.  Said mammoth goes on a rampage and sucks out people's life force (like the creature in Stephen King's Cat's Eye).  Only the scientist studying it and his crazy family have any chance of stopping the beast.  Add a couple of government agents to the mix and you have a pretty good movie.

Tom Skerritt is excellent as the UFO conspiracy believing patriarch of the dysfunctional family.  The agents are well played as are most of the remaining recurring characters.  As the film progresses we see that this story is bigger than just the events in the film.  A pair of strange minor characters give a glimpse into the bigger picture.  Even the ending is above normal for a prehistoric killer film.  While not Jurassic Park this film has a unique take on the idea.  The mammoth looks almost like a zombie due to its long freeze (now there's an idea).  My only problem is a couple of scenes where the mammoth shows up out of nowhere suddenly but otherwise I had a real good time with this one.  Check it out.",1206403200,33,1449,4.544401544401544
2993265,4,B000X0GWNG,"Mammoth is a great movie. It's the best B-movie I have seen and has a great production value. The spaceship flying towards earth ala 1950s b-movie style.

Vincent Vetresca and Summer Glau are great. Overall a fantastic movie if you can get past the zombie mammoth due to space aliens.",1202860800,3,284,4.68
2993266,1,B000X0GWNG,"I have just received this movie and played it and absolutely disappointed in it not only is it second rate but thought that Tom Skerritt demeened himself by playing the role. This movie is virtually a third rate comic movie and do not recommend it to anybody.

2993267,5,B000X0GWNG,"If you want a super gory TV movie like raptor island or Terdactal you maybe dissapoointed with this on. Despite it's cheesy acting this movie has decent plo and special effects the destruction scenes mostly of people our vehicles are pretty well corraphed. The people getting killed and squashed, impaled our having there energy suck out of them are little violent. You due her the bones break and squish but there absolutely almost no gore. I swear though this was a tab bit longer in the televised version but I belive there was one little flash back scene that was a little gore that got cut from the dvd relase when the guy that was study his arm tells how it was sliced off  by an alien technolgy while he was on a date with his sheriff Buddy. When a prestoric manoth is freed by a fallening meteorite. It's up to a local musuem crurator, his daugter twogoverment agents, the local sherrif and the crutators alien's obbosed father to save the day. Body fatalites pill up fast as the Mammoth leaves a pack of destcuion in is path. Can the main characters stop this massive 11 ton Snufflogpies want to be monster before it tramples the town to pieces. Find out in the thrilling conclusion.  If you thinhk this is to tame see Raptor islan Cobra versus Komdo, and Boa versus pyhton are good recommendations if you want more of the traditional gore and violence. This is also a novel if I remember correctly. This movie is older than the copyright date says. If was released to DVD on January 8 of this years but it was actually aired on scifi quit a while ago sometime back in 2005 or 2006 or early 2007.  Also coming to DVD if your interest is the second lake Placid whichg I belive goes up for sale next Tuesday I believe was on scifi channel around the same time as the Mammoth premire.  I took a while to buy the rights to this for people to become intersted in distrubition of it in this format. Can this monstroity be stop.

was looking toward a good movie, but.... .  What we have here is a mixture
of stuff that works great or doesn't work. Im talking about the acting,
the visuals the flow of the movie the music. If all worked then we would
have a 4 star movie..but there is just too much that doesn't work that
bring this creature movie to a 2 star. Some of the stuff that did not
work were ...grampa actor(not convincing)...some of the music...acting
went above stupid for some parts...Sherrif's deputies...you gotta be kidding.... So in the end i can only suggest this movie is only good for

2993284,5,B000X0GWNG,"The SYFY Channel strikes again but this is one of its better efforts. This is a great spoof of monster movies with just enough seriousness to keep it from becoming a farce.  It's revived-monster-running-amok in a way similiar to the old 50's horror films without the usual ""There are some things Man is not supposed to know"" cliche.  The graphics behind the beginning credits give a little forewarning of what's to come. There's also references to many movie and TV titles as well as similar situations ranging from The Day the Earth Stood Still to The Avengers, with a dollop of teenage horror film thrown in for good measure. Th first scene set in the museum which introduced one of the main characters could almost be from a Disney movie. Vincent Ventresca is the quintessential bumbling, absentminded professor of a dad, Amber Glau the rebellious but plucky teenage daughter, and Tom Skerritt the Seti-following conspiracy-theorist grandfather.  All are fine in their respective roles. Throw a couple of Men In Black NRO agents into the mix and it's entertaining viewing.  My only wonder is how something that big could sneak up on someone without them hearing and in the next scene be stomping around so loudly the entire building shakes.  Ignore that, however, and sit back and enjoy.  (Incidentally, this movie was made in Louisiana and Romania and I'm still wondering why. Those two locations would seem complete opposites.)",1418169600,,1432,4.995798319327731

Like when some of the characters were talking about needing help, then it shows another character and the words ""the help"" appear on the screen. I liked that stuff.

My brother and I have a tradition of 'bad' B-movie night. I like to see these things. Not to mention Summer Glau is in it (what drew me to the movie in the first place), yes, you can laugh now - Firefly fandom follows her work ;)

The cast worked well together, the plot was a little slow but once it picked up just swept you away, and the scenery was pretty cool. Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much. Also, there is no where to rent, buy, or rip this movie so I am extremely happy that I could get a copy of it for so cheap! Fast shipping (as always) and granted me a great time.

2993307,5,B000X0GWNG,"This is by far my favorite Mammuthus Primigenius (Woolly Mammoth) on a rampage movie.  I know of none better.  This opus is goofy, dopey, and just plain fun.  It stars Vincent Ventresca channeling his inner Looney Tunes sensibility.  He's matched every step of the way by Tom Skerritt as his alien enthused father.  Jokes abound, situations most humorous run riot, the only sour note I detected was poor Squirrelly's ignominious demise.  Otherwise, fun fun fun.  Of course, that all depends on your sense of fun and appreciation of lame 50s Sci-Fi creature features.  If parodies aren't your thing, avoid at all cost.  All others enjoy.

2993310,3,B000X0GWNG,"""Mammoth""(2006) was directed by Tim Cox. This isn't a big budget action sci-fi movie. Its budget was modest and so the story focuses on the quirky humour and characters rather than on blowing us away with special effects, and for this reason the film was a pleasant surprise. Tom Skerritt, Summer Glau, Leila Arcieri, and Vicent Ventresca star in this film about a museum mammoth that is brought back to life and terrorizes a town.

This DVD looks surprisingly fine on a big screen tv. The colors are rich and the blacks are deep. Even the clarity is very good.",1309046400,2,561,4.61
2993311,3,B000X0GWNG,"In the pantheon of frozen monster comedies, ""Mammoth"" is one of the most outlandish. The film is played straight, but amazingly while the extras allude to it providing a bit of humor, they also claim it's scary. They got that half right. The film opens with one of the most ridiculous fake science scenes in history (or since the 1950s, anyway,) and rapidly progresses to an even more ludicrous credit sequence. Vincent Ventresca plays annoying Dr. Frank Abernathy, a scatterbrained Mammoth scientist who can't get his personal life in order.  Summer Glau plays his petulant daughter Jack, whose sixteenth birthday is one to remember, while the generally talented Tom Skerritt entertainingly plays his UFO and conspiracy-crazed father, Simon.

The film can't seem to make up its mind if it's a spoof or not, but it can't be taken seriously as anything else. To crank the plot up, a meteor streaks across the sky and hits the mammoth that's preserved in a giant ice cube in the town of Blackwater, Louisiana. How a small, backwards town got such an impressive natural history museum is left to your imagination. What you'll wish was left to your imagination are the special effects, which are beyond laughable. You will be surprised (or not) to see the mammoth come to life and escape, but not before sucking the life force out of the janitor in a unique trunk-to-nose spectacle. (Think ""Ghostbusters"" but infinitely less scary.)

Frank arrives home and is mad at his dad for giving Jack his old VW Bug because he wanted to give her a hybrid. (Oh, please.) Jack is, of course, mad at her father for coming home late despite the fact that his museum just blew up and his mammoth just came back to life and escaped after a UFO landed on it. (Certainly taking your driving test is more important than that.) Government secret agents soon show up (of course) on direct orders of the President. (Ponder.) While this is the moment Skerritt knew was coming, the plot goes in seach of Jack who has escaped to the worst teen party ever filmed in the middle of a forest. It's inevitable that the party and escaped mammoth plotlines must converge, and indeed they do. After discovering that a Taser won't stop a mammoth, one of the agents loses his head while the other remains cool as a cucumber.

The mammoth goes on a rampage and I am sad to report interrupts the most revolting automotive romance scene in film history. While backwoods Sheriff Marion Morrison (Charles Carroll) immediately grasps the enormity of the alien conspiracy, a guy in an ape suit enters and leaves the story quickly and pointlessly. The film makes clear that ""the current administration"" (that would be Bush, of course) will nuke the town if they don't get a handle on the mammoth-UFO co-conspirators quickly. Skerritt joins the pursuit and battle (I swear) outfitted in a welder's mask, and brandishing a mace and a garbage can lid as an improvised sword and shield. (You'd have thought a lifetime conspiracy nut would be better prepared.)

All this leads to one of the singularly most amusing scenes in history. The town coroner and Sheriff Morrison let the rest of the cast on a secret: stored cryogenically in an official freezer (""Hands Off!"") is a frozen human hand, formerly belonging to the coroner. That's not the good part. The hand, when microwaved on the popcorn setting, comes to life and uses American Sign Language to threaten the Earth. This scene is precious enough to earn the film three stars on its own for loopy humor. The agent gets it out of the oven with tongs, tazes it, then uses her Blackberry's tricorder app to scan the hand. Entertaining pontification ensues: ""How do you explain the zombie soul-sucking effect?,"" and ""Do you mean to say this is intergalactic OnStar?,"" or how about ""We have an alien-possessed mammoth on the loose and if we don't stop it the government's going to kill all of us!""

As a sweet sixteen gift after confronting ""the hand goblin,"" Frank lets his daughter decide the fate of the world. Her decision is made easier when her boyfriend is impaled by a mammoth tusk, so they decide to lure the creature to a metal smelter. (No, really.) They first try pouring molten steel on him to no effect, but Skerritt shows up with a tanker truck of liquid nitrogen and they decide to flash freeze him instead. Sadly, in a cruel twist of fate Skerritt is also frozen in ""a state of perfect hibernation,"" leaving the option of a sequel open with the obligatory ""The End?""

The DVD includes a modestly interesting ""making of"" feature. Glau has an extremely inflated opinion of the film, while Skerritt is notably less enthuiastic. Despite its occasional attempts at being a horror movie (a trait that is oddly emphasized in the extras) this really is more of a spoof, with elements from many earlier monster movies incorporated. The principal problem is that the characters (except loony Skerritt) are not likeable; combine that with a relative dearth of acting ability on the set, and a plot that wants to be all things to all people, ""Mammoth"" doesn't really succeed at doing anything well. It's enjoyable as single-viewing B-movie entertainment, but there are many better creature features and comedies out there.",1308873600,10,5226,4.806451612903226

2993313,2,B000X0GWNG,"I like cheesy grade b movies for casual entertainment.  Grade B has almost become more the 'Budget' that is low budget, it's also becoming a Flag for cheesy, simplistic, fun to watch without a meaning or purpose film.  Mammoth was extremely disappointing.  I like Tom Skerrit as an actor most of the time.  I also like 'animal on rampage' Grade B movies.  Many of the Maneater series are terrific Grade B's, along with some like Yeti, Rogue, Prey, etc.  These movies decided to either have a 'message/serious' presentation, or be outlandishly fun to watch.  Mammoth tried but didn't succeed in doing both. If you're looking for a fun Grade B try Wyvern, Prey, Rogue, Rise of the Gargoyles, most any of the 'Anaconda' movies but avoid Mammoth.  Rent it just to see what a bad grade B movie is or buy it and give to a friend or relative you want to get even with.",1296172800,2,861,4.509677419354839

2993325,3,B000X0GWNG,"When you think of a movie about mammoths, you might not think of flying saucers, reanimated corpses, or 1950s-style sensibilities. But then, you're not director Tim Cox.

It all starts with a little blue pill.  No not THAT pill - this one can wake up an elephant. Ahem.  Never mind.

Anyway, a mammoth discovered perfectly preserved in a hunk of ice at a museum in Blackwater, Louisiana. Dr. Frank Abernathy (Vincent Ventresca) has noted the little blue pill in scans of the ice that have been otherwise undetected by the scientific community and decides to take a sample - which sets off a homing device.  A flying saucer fires a sphere from space through the beginning credits, which smashes right into the mammoth, reanimating it.  From there the mammoth goes on a rampage, goring, smashing, and sucking the souls of its victims through its snout.

Yes, you read that right.  The undead mammoth sucks up souls like one of those mastodon vacuums on the Flintstones.  Your opinion of this feature hinges on whether or not you take Mammoth seriously - which is pretty hard to do when, at one point, Abernathy uses the blue pill to lure the mammoth and it rises up silently a second later.

Or the Evil Dead detour, in which every hand joke is crammed into a scene with an animated hand.

Or the Men in Black in-jokes where two government agents (Leila Arcieri and Marcus Lyle Brown) wear dark suits, carry ray guns, and cover up evidence of an alien invasion.

Or the direct references to Empire Strikes Back, War of the Worlds (original and remake), The Blob, and Night of the Living Dead.

Like all good monster movies, the heart of the film isn't about the monster at all. Somewhere between the in-jokes is a tale about a scientist, his estranged daughter (played by Summer Glau, a bit too old for the part but still lovely) and his estranged father (Tom Skerritt in a great comedic turn).

On its surface, this is just another monster movie entry.  But the director decided to enjoy himself by making a 1950s monster movie homage, which is a different but related beast.  If you're a fan of classic sci-fi, schlock horror, or Summer Glau, Mammoth's for you. Just don't expect much from the elephant.",1284768000,8,2203,4.668393782383419
2993326,3,B000X0GWNG,"A frozen mammoth being prepared for a museum exhibit is revived and proceeds to wreak havoc on Small Town, USA. The visual effects are good, but not great. Still, the film moves at a brisk pace and has some witty dialogue. Fans of the movie Alien will be pleased to see Tom Skerritt playing the father of the scientist trying to stop the beast.

  I discovered this movie on the SyFy Channel. It's the typical creature of the week feature the network is known for, but the prescence of the lovely Summer Glau makes it stand apart. If you've enjoyed her work on Firefly and The Sarah Connor Chronicles, then give this one a look.",1257724800,2,628,4.443478260869565
2993327,4,B000X0GWNG,"Usually Sci Fi channel movies are heavy with the cheese, sparse with the plot, and graphics that make someone born after '80 cringe.

But the acting is amazing, the cheese is sweet and you'll love the characters, especially Vincent Ventresca's Dr. Frank, like they're your social awkward best friend.
I'm keeping back only one star because the DVD lacks any kind of special features, in spite of it's UNRATED proclamation, and it doesn't have any subtitles. I love subtitles so this is more a personal choice than an overall criticism.

This was not only unnecessary but it marred an otherwise good solid movie, making it appear as if the makers of this movie didn't really take it seriously.  The humor is really misplaced, because this is supposed to be a kind of scary movie in the sense of Godzilla, ect.

3227761,4,B000X0GWNG,"There have been a lot of movies where a prehistoric beast is thawed/discovered/created just so it can go around killing people but this one is different and more original than most.  After five years of study a frozen mammoth comes back to life after the museum is struck by a meteor.  But if you payed attention to the wonderful dancing cave paintings in the credits, you will have a better understanding of the alien involvement in this event.  Said mammoth goes on a rampage and sucks out people's life force (like the creature in Stephen King's Cat's Eye).  Only the scientist studying it and his crazy family have any chance of stopping the beast.  Add a couple of government agents to the mix and you have a pretty good movie.

Tom Skerritt is excellent as the UFO conspiracy believing patriarch of the dysfunctional family.  The agents are well played as are most of the remaining recurring characters.  As the film progresses we see that this story is bigger than just the events in the film.  A pair of strange minor characters give a glimpse into the bigger picture.  Even the ending is above normal for a prehistoric killer film.  While not Jurassic Park this film has a unique take on the idea.  The mammoth looks almost like a zombie due to its long freeze (now there's an idea).  My only problem is a couple of scenes where the mammoth shows up out of nowhere suddenly but otherwise I had a real good time with this one.  Check it out.",1206403200,33,1449,4.544401544401544

It's revived-monster-running-amok in a way similiar to the old 50's horror films without the usual ""There are some things Man is not supposed to know"" cliche.  The graphics behind the beginning credits give a little forewarning of what's to come. There's also references to many movie and TV titles as well as similar situations ranging from The Day the Earth Stood Still to The Avengers, with a dollop of teenage horror film thrown in for good measure. Th first scene set in the museum which introduced one of the main characters could almost be from a Disney movie. Vincent Ventresca is the quintessential bumbling, absentminded professor of a dad, Amber Glau the rebellious but plucky teenage daughter, and Tom Skerritt the Seti-following conspiracy-theorist grandfather.  All are fine in their respective roles. Throw a couple of Men In Black NRO agents into the mix and it's entertaining viewing.  My only wonder is how something that big could sneak up on someone without them hearing and in the next scene be stomping around so loudly the entire building shakes.  Ignore that, however, and sit back and enjoy.  (Incidentally, this movie was made in Louisiana and Romania and I'm still wondering why.

3227807,3,B000X0GWNG,"""Mammoth""(2006) was directed by Tim Cox. This isn't a big budget action sci-fi movie. Its budget was modest and so the story focuses on the quirky humour and characters rather than on blowing us away with special effects, and for this reason the film was a pleasant surprise. Tom Skerritt, Summer Glau, Leila Arcieri, and Vicent Ventresca star in this film about a museum mammoth that is brought back to life and terrorizes a town.

This DVD looks surprisingly fine on a big screen tv. The colors are rich and the blacks are deep. Even the clarity is very good.",1309046400,2,561,4.61
3227808,3,B000X0GWNG,"In the pantheon of frozen monster comedies, ""Mammoth"" is one of the most outlandish. The film is played straight, but amazingly while the extras allude to it providing a bit of humor, they also claim it's scary. They got that half right. The film opens with one of the most ridiculous fake science scenes in history (or since the 1950s, anyway,) and rapidly progresses to an even more ludicrous credit sequence. Vincent Ventresca plays annoying Dr. Frank Abernathy, a scatterbrained Mammoth scientist who can't get his personal life in order.  Summer Glau plays his petulant daughter Jack, whose sixteenth birthday is one to remember, while the generally talented Tom Skerritt entertainingly plays his UFO and conspiracy-crazed father, Simon.

The film can't seem to make up its mind if it's a spoof or not, but it can't be taken seriously as anything else. To crank the plot up, a meteor streaks across the sky and hits the mammoth that's preserved in a giant ice cube in the town of Blackwater, Louisiana. How a small, backwards town got such an impressive natural history museum is left to your imagination. What you'll wish was left to your imagination are the special effects, which are beyond laughable. You will be surprised (or not) to see the mammoth come to life and escape, but not before sucking the life force out of the janitor in a unique trunk-to-nose spectacle. (Think ""Ghostbusters"" but infinitely less scary.)

Frank arrives home and is mad at his dad for giving Jack his old VW Bug because he wanted to give her a hybrid. (Oh, please.) Jack is, of course, mad at her father for coming home late despite the fact that his museum just blew up and his mammoth just came back to life and escaped after a UFO landed on it. (Certainly taking your driving test is more important than that.) Government secret agents soon show up (of course) on direct orders of the President. (Ponder.) While this is the moment Skerritt knew was coming, the plot goes in seach of Jack who has escaped to the worst teen party ever filmed in the middle of a forest. It's inevitable that the party and escaped mammoth plotlines must converge, and indeed they do. After discovering that a Taser won't stop a mammoth, one of the agents loses his head while the other remains cool as a cucumber.

The mammoth goes on a rampage and I am sad to report interrupts the most revolting automotive romance scene in film history. While backwoods Sheriff Marion Morrison (Charles Carroll) immediately grasps the enormity of the alien conspiracy, a guy in an ape suit enters and leaves the story quickly and pointlessly. The film makes clear that ""the current administration"" (that would be Bush, of course) will nuke the town if they don't get a handle on the mammoth-UFO co-conspirators quickly. Skerritt joins the pursuit and battle (I swear) outfitted in a welder's mask, and brandishing a mace and a garbage can lid as an improvised sword and shield. (You'd have thought a lifetime conspiracy nut would be better prepared.)

All this leads to one of the singularly most amusing scenes in history. The town coroner and Sheriff Morrison let the rest of the cast on a secret: stored cryogenically in an official freezer (""Hands Off!"") is a frozen human hand, formerly belonging to the coroner. That's not the good part. The hand, when microwaved on the popcorn setting, comes to life and uses American Sign Language to threaten the Earth. This scene is precious enough to earn the film three stars on its own for loopy humor. The agent gets it out of the oven with tongs, tazes it, then uses her Blackberry's tricorder app to scan the hand. Entertaining pontification ensues: ""How do you explain the zombie soul-sucking effect?,"" and ""Do you mean to say this is intergalactic OnStar?,"" or how about ""We have an alien-possessed mammoth on the loose and if we don't stop it the government's going to kill all of us!""

As a sweet sixteen gift after confronting ""the hand goblin,"" Frank lets his daughter decide the fate of the world. Her decision is made easier when her boyfriend is impaled by a mammoth tusk, so they decide to lure the creature to a metal smelter. (No, really.) They first try pouring molten steel on him to no effect, but Skerritt shows up with a tanker truck of liquid nitrogen and they decide to flash freeze him instead. Sadly, in a cruel twist of fate Skerritt is also frozen in ""a state of perfect hibernation,"" leaving the option of a sequel open with the obligatory ""The End?""

The DVD includes a modestly interesting ""making of"" feature. Glau has an extremely inflated opinion of the film, while Skerritt is notably less enthuiastic. Despite its occasional attempts at being a horror movie (a trait that is oddly emphasized in the extras) this really is more of a spoof, with elements from many earlier monster movies incorporated. The principal problem is that the characters (except loony Skerritt) are not likeable; combine that with a relative dearth of acting ability on the set, and a plot that wants to be all things to all people, ""Mammoth"" doesn't really succeed at doing anything well. It's enjoyable as single-viewing B-movie entertainment, but there are many better creature features and comedies out there.",1308873600,10,5226,4.806451612903226

Many of the Maneater series are terrific Grade B's, along with some like Yeti, Rogue, Prey, etc.  These movies decided to either have a 'message/serious' presentation, or be outlandishly fun to watch.  Mammoth tried but didn't succeed in doing both. If you're looking for a fun Grade B try Wyvern, Prey, Rogue, Rise of the Gargoyles, most any of the 'Anaconda' movies but avoid Mammoth.

3227822,3,B000X0GWNG,"When you think of a movie about mammoths, you might not think of flying saucers, reanimated corpses, or 1950s-style sensibilities. But then, you're not director Tim Cox.

It all starts with a little blue pill.  No not THAT pill - this one can wake up an elephant. Ahem.  Never mind.

Anyway, a mammoth discovered perfectly preserved in a hunk of ice at a museum in Blackwater, Louisiana. Dr. Frank Abernathy (Vincent Ventresca) has noted the little blue pill in scans of the ice that have been otherwise undetected by the scientific community and decides to take a sample - which sets off a homing device.  A flying saucer fires a sphere from space through the beginning credits, which smashes right into the mammoth, reanimating it.  From there the mammoth goes on a rampage, goring, smashing, and sucking the souls of its victims through its snout.

Yes, you read that right.  The undead mammoth sucks up souls like one of those mastodon vacuums on the Flintstones.  Your opinion of this feature hinges on whether or not you take Mammoth seriously - which is pretty hard to do when, at one point, Abernathy uses the blue pill to lure the mammoth and it rises up silently a second later.

Or the Evil Dead detour, in which every hand joke is crammed into a scene with an animated hand.

Or the Men in Black in-jokes where two government agents (Leila Arcieri and Marcus Lyle Brown) wear dark suits, carry ray guns, and cover up evidence of an alien invasion.

Or the direct references to Empire Strikes Back, War of the Worlds (original and remake), The Blob, and Night of the Living Dead.

Like all good monster movies, the heart of the film isn't about the monster at all. Somewhere between the in-jokes is a tale about a scientist, his estranged daughter (played by Summer Glau, a bit too old for the part but still lovely) and his estranged father (Tom Skerritt in a great comedic turn).

On its surface, this is just another monster movie entry.  But the director decided to enjoy himself by making a 1950s monster movie homage, which is a different but related beast.  If you're a fan of classic sci-fi, schlock horror, or Summer Glau, Mammoth's for you. Just don't expect much from the elephant.",1284768000,8,2203,4.668393782383419

  I discovered this movie on the SyFy Channel. It's the typical creature of the week feature the network is known for, but the prescence of the lovely Summer Glau makes it stand apart.

So the Mammoth comes back to life and sucks the souls out of people.

I could not bare to sit through any more then 30 mins of this, it was just going no where and getting more ridicules as it went on... Why would a mammoth come back to life to suck souls out of people? If it was explained, I really do not care for such a stupid plot.",1230076800,2,716,4.035211267605634

3227829,4,B000X0GWNG,"This movie was enjoyable. The acting was solid, although nothing special.  The plot was good, but there was one major drawback that really hurt this movie, and that was the silly sense of humor that seemed to come along about every 10 - 15 minutes.  This was not only unnecessary but it marred an otherwise good solid movie, making it appear as if the makers of this movie didn't really take it seriously.  The humor is really misplaced, because this is supposed to be a kind of scary movie in the sense of Godzilla, ect.

Well, if occasional silly humor doesn't bother you then this is definitely worth watching for about 90 minutes.",1208995200,2,634,4.584070796460177

8226315,5,B000X0GWNG,It is a b monster movie! Tom skerritt is cool as grandpa movie theater  manager ufo monster hunter! Summer is hot! The story has humor. For a sci fi channel movie this one has a higher grade than others. The story is at a slow pace for good reason . To build up for the people. Which I liked. I wish they would have shown more of the old theater monster scenes.. Where mr skerritt ( manager) works.,1484784000,,398,4.102564102564102
