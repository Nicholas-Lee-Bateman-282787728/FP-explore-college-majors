But as I have been enjoying the DVD releases for Otsuka Ai this past year, similar to my Amuro Namie DVD reviews, with Otsuka Ai, I am going backwards and in this case, now reviewing Otsuka's first concert DVD ""JAM PUNCH Tour 2005 - at Tokyo International Forum Hall A on 1st of June 2005'.

There are two releases of this in Japan, a normal version (which I am reviewing) and a limited edition version which includes off-shot video clips (behind-the-scenes) and also DVD easter eggs.

Because Otsuka's older DVD's are now budget DVD's ($25 might be a bit of a stretch for some to call it a ""budget"" DVD), getting past concerts on DVD's for a cheaper price is a good thing.

For each Japanese music DVD that I have seen and watched, there are many that bore me (I'm sure being there is a completely different experience) and the type of concerts that make me feel excited even though I'm not there and even though the concert took place years earlier.

Otsuka Ai concerts have been very enjoyable and her first concert DVD is no exception. Without rehashing of what has been reviewed on this DVD, I'll just briefly give my thoughts on this DVD.

The DVD for her first concert is actually very enjoyable. I was not expecting anything remarkable for her stage setup and wasn't sure if we would see different costumes during performances but the concert did surpass my expectations.

The first concert features Otsuka on a good sized stage with her band with a big video screen in the center. Very good stage lighting and the mood that is acquired during such songs such as ""Momo no Hanabira"" where the whole stage is dark blue with an amber light shining on Otsuka who is wearing a beautiful gray dress.

Another beautiful setting was during her performance of ""Daisuki da yo."" and a night sky with stars all above the stage was a beautiful touch to the performance of the popular ballad.

The video screen plays a big part in the concert as songs such as ""Friends"" from her drama ""Tokyo Friends"" shows clips from the drama series, showing various video clips during each performance and a cool way to introduce her band members.

Speaking of the band members, similar to how Hamasaki Ayumi brings her band members to the forefront of her concerts and showcasing the musical family of their tour. Otsuka does the same with her band as well. And thus, the excitement on stage is shown through the band members instrument playing and movements. For me, I like the acknowledgment to her band and Otsuka's interaction with band members.

As mentioned, different costume changes. From the beginning, she sports a black hood with cape and a mask. Sporting a beautiful gray gown and then later in a white gown and then later on in the concert, sporting blue jeans and a t-shirt.

As for Otsuka Ai, she's not a dancer, so what you expect to see from Hamasaki, Koda or Amuro, not with her. No major choreography but showcasing her enthusiasm by smiling, singing and interacting with her fans. For songs such as ""Himawari"" and ""amaenbo"", Otsuka plays the piano and sings.

As for the audience, they were definitely into it. You saw people of all ages at the concert and many singing and really getting into it. If there is one thing that I have seen with a lot of Otsuka Ai concerts is that she does interact with them and everyone in the audience is excited.

So, overall a very enjoyable concert from what you see on stage and also in the audience with everyone all into it.

And for those wondering if she cries in the end, yes, on the final song she does. What Japanese concert with a female artist or group would be complete without ""the cry"" right?

Now, as for the video editing, I can tell you right now that you really get good cuts, good camera placement from within the stage, behind the stage focusing on the band and the audience, close up front to the audience, behind the audience to the stage. There are many cameras everywhere, capturing the excitement and the transitions from one camera to the other is not dizzying and done very well.

As for the DVD insert, you get a two fold insert that features photos from the concert inside and the outside is track info. and credits which feature band names, stage names, etc. Also, an insert promotional of her CD single ""Planetarium"" that was being announced at that time.

I may be a bit biased to the music of Otsuka Ai but I've seen a lot of concert DVD's in the past year or two featuring artists I enjoy but something was off that I just didn't like the experience. I will tell you right now that this concert DVD is not one of them.

Otsuka Ai's ""JAM PUNCH Tour 2005 - at Tokyo International Forum Hall A on 1st of June 2005' is actually a very fun, entertaining concert that even though it's her first, it's still done very well and definitely worth to fit in your collection if you are a fan of her music.
