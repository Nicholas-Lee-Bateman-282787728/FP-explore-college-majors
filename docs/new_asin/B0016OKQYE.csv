3162397,1,B0016OKQYE,Not worth paying for this DVD. The History Channel has put out some great DVD's........this is not one of them. The only thing worth mentioning was they covered the Pat Tillman case and showed how the accident happened.,1284768000,4,219,4.7894736842105265
3162398,1,B0016OKQYE,"This dvd has absolutely nothing to do with sniping, in Afghanistan or anywhere else. It covers general combat operations and has a very brief review of the Pat Tillman case. Dont waste your time or money, just watch it on tv.",1214524800,15,225,4.512195121951219

8263759,2,B0016OKQYE,"It does not tell any snipper story.
It is about a sad friend fire misshot that killed an American football superstar.
Not interesting at all.
Do not recommend.",1354233600,,159,4.714285714285714
8263760,2,B0016OKQYE,"As others have mentioned previously, while labeled in the title as being about snipers, this documentary doesn't have anything to do with snipers!  And what's stranger and more disappointing is that The History Channel must know there's a problem because they are no longer offering this DVD on their online store.  Go figure!",1327017600,,326,5.132075471698113

8263762,2,B0016OKQYE,i love military documentaries but i was dissappointed with this one..it by know means has anything to do with snipers at all..it is a good video but the title needs to be changed..it would be really great if the history channel did a video about actual sniper's and there missions in iraq and afghanistan..,1314835200,,306,4.685185185185185
8263763,1,B0016OKQYE,This is a rip off. nothing to do with sniping. poorly edited. still set up as a tv docco wit updates for after ads. don't waste your money,1291852800,,138,3.9642857142857144
8263764,1,B0016OKQYE,"The title and the front cover is misleading.
There is absolutely no sniper action in this DVD
There is a description of several shootouts between
the Taliban and the US army and special forces.
