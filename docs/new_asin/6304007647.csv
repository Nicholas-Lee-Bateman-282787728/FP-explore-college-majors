755528,4,6304007647,"I myself, having seen all five Rocky movies think that one, three, and four are must sees.  Two is has been forgotten because of its lack of major difference to the first, which is by far the best.  Five was more  depressing than Mickey and Apollo dying combined due to the riches to rags  Pauly bumbling.  the Don King spoof was a little out of line too,",943401600,5,355,4.2388059701492535

755927,5,6304007647,"The Rocky Anthology consists of five films - Rocky,Rocky II,Rocky III,Rocky IV and Rocky V - that tells the story of a small-time boxer Rocky Balboa,a character portrayed by Sylvester Stallone,that has become part of the American culture and an icon that represents hope and optimism as well as the sport of boxing.

Rocky I tells the story of how Rocky proved himself to be not a worthless when he goes the distance against heavyweight champion,Apollo Creed after suffering from several defeats both inside the ring and experiences in life like getting rejected by Adrian and being mocked by his trainer,Mickey.

Rocky II tells the story of how Rocky managed to become a heavyweight world champion by beating Apollo Creed.

Rocky III tells the story of how Rocky rose above from defeat after reclaiming his heavyweight title against Clubber Lang.

Rocky IV tells the story of how Rocky avenged for the death of his friend - Apollo Creed - against Russian boxer Ivan Drago and made Americans proud during the time of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Rocky V has Rocky become a boxing trainer for Tommy Gunn after retiring from the sport and returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where he belongs after losing his fortune to a crooked accountant.

Rocky films are more than just movies for Americans as most of them have become big parts of their life and their culture. The first(Rocky I) provided hope and optimism during the time when Americans were experiencing hardship and difficulties due to the tough economic situation that the country was experiencing during its time of release. The other films may not be a classic compared to the films I have just mentioned in the previous sentence but they still gave us excitement and entertainment as we get to relate to Rocky Balboa when he started a family (Rocky II), rose above from defeat (Rocky III), made us proud being Americans during the Cold War (Rocky IV) and become a mentor to others (Rocky V).

Overall,it was one movie character that would always remain with us for many years to come.",1414540800,,2073,4.822535211267605

Deleted Footage. 33 min. video commentary by Sylvester Stallone. Tributes to Burgess Meredith and cinematographer James Crabe. Not all bonus features are included from the 2-disc Rocky Collector's DVD. Check out the Rocky: Undisputed Collection on Blu-ray.

Though now when I'm reviewing this they came out with a two disc of the original film that is the way to go. The sequels (besides 6) are bare bones nothing. Why don't the sequels have special features? Two was a worthy sequel, 3 was great, 4 is the. Biggest rocky and sports film of all time, 5 is good but you could at Lear get some interviews. And what really doesn't make any sence is why rocky balboa has features and the others don't. If your gonna release 6 with features then why not 2-5?

756164,5,6304007647,"There is no way any series can match the Rocky Series and most people agree, here's my review on the series.

Rocky: The first in the series and the best. it started the story which is a classic, Rocky(Sylvester Stallone)is a small time boxer and a collector for a lone shark, but he has a good heart, he has a relationship with a pet store worker Adrian( Talia Shire) and his best friend is her brother Paulie(Bert Young). When the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weather) come to Philadelphia he fights rocky for the championship. Its sample enough to rap your head around it so you don't have to think so much. Its a great movie, one of my favorite movies of all time, and if you seen the movie then you know what i mean.

Rating: 10/10 Must see

Rocky II: My least favorite in the series. The movie starts where the last movie left off, Apollo is upset that Rocky did see well in the fight that he wants a rematch, but Rocky say no to him and to boxing and marries adrian, Rocky tries to get a normal job, he tries Commercial, an office job, even working at the meat shop paulie worked at the First movie, all which don't work out, so trying to get some money for his family, Rocky agree to fight Apollo again, which adrian doesn't like, but after she gives birth to their son she wants him to, so Rocky train for the big fight which is a little big some hit are clearly aren't making contact with the sound but a great fight. Rocky II is a great movie but not as good as the first, but still worth the watch.

Rating: 7/10, Okay

Rocky III: This movie change the way of the Rocky movies, from drama to action. the movie starts with a montage of Rocky going on a winning streak with the song ""Eye of the tiger"" later in the movie he planes to retire, but is challenge by Clubber Lang(Mr. T) Rocky agrees but loses the fight because Mickey, his trainer dies. But Apollo creed comes back to help him get into fight shape, one last thing to say is that this is the only movie that shows the whole fight which is awesome. Rocky III maybe my personal favorite Sequel, I just love but not as much as the first.

Rating: 10/10 Must see

Rocky IV: The corniest movie off all time but at the same time the most entertaining movie of all time. When a russian boxer, Ivan Drago comes to america, Apollo fights him and gets killed in the ring, Rocky blames himself for not stopping the fight so he wants to fight Drago himself, the one thing about this movie is the many montages in it, they're are like 5 ore 6 in the movie and that's just awesome. The fight seen is the most brutal and the best ass far ass entertaining goes, after rocky wins he gives a speech about world peace for some reason, i don't know I mean if I just beat the s*** out of someone I wouldn't say ""No more fighting. Fighting is wrong"" but that's just me. Rocky IV is wildly entertaining even with the weird moments.

Rating: 9.5/10, Go see

Rocky V: Most people don't like this movie, even Stallone, but i like it. It starts after Rocky IV with Rocky Learning that he has brain damage and needs to quit boxing for good, second he loses all his money thanks to Paulie, so they have to move out off their house and go back to the house where paulie and Adrian lived in the first movie, Rocky trains a young, powerful but ungrateful fighter Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), when a boxing manager gets Tommy away from rocky, he goes from the title. When he wins he is still in the shadow of rocky balboa so he takes his anger out on him in a great street fight. This is the least best, but it doesn't mean its bad it's a really good movie but not as good ass the other movies some say that the reason it sucks is because rocky didn't fight in the ring, that may be true but that street fight is so awesome I didn't care.

Rating: 8/10: Good

Some That's the Rocky Movies, A great set of awesome stories and loveable characters, The box set itself is very good, the only extras are on the first movie disk, keep in mind I have the 2001 version and there are not subtitles for the Russians in Rocky IV so that can be a little Disappointing, but other then that the set is great, i love the side pictures that makes Rocky,

These two movies never get old and indeed I have watched them several times before. Starting with Rocky 3, there becomes a problem, as if they should have never been made, and indeed a pure terror to watch. Near impossible to sit through these messes. Rocky 3-5 are way hokey and don't work at all. In other words maybe Stallone and gang weren't ""hungry enough"" for Rocky 3-5 and just looking for a payday. Still the set is worth having as Rocky 1 and 2 are strong and up there with other top of the line movies ever mad; which indeed are few and far between.

756329,3,6304007647,"I love all the Rocky films as they all, in my opinion, bring something to the table. I'll agree that the original was the best along with the newest one (Rocky Balboa). Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV and V rank in that order in my view.

Now, there are virtually no extras with any of the films in this set except for some promos from when the films were originally released. This set has only Rocky's 1-5 as well. Though it may cost more, you are probably better off buying them individually, especially when you consider that the first Rocky now has great extras as well as the recent Rocky.

I own this set along with Rocky Balboa but if I had to do this again, I would've bought the 25th Anniversary of Rocky along with Rocky Balboa and would've tried to find the others individually. Most stores sell Rocky 2-5 for about $5 to $10 a piece so overall, you'd probably get more for your money.

The films themselves are great. Just wished all of them would've had better extras because I am sure each one had some fun behind the scenes stuff! If you REALLY want the movies, then I'd recommend the new set coming out that has all six or buy this one and try to find Rocky Balboa on its own since some stores carry it now for about $10-$15 dollars.

I have purchased a Samsung 56 inch Widescreen from [...]  Before I decided on where to make the purchase, I was reading the ratings from past customers of some of the places.  There were many places where the ratings were poor.  Some places have lied about the price by trying to change it after making the purchase.  Others had undependable deliveries.  When I read the feedback from people who have purchased from amazon.com everything that I have read was great.  I knew that was where I had to go.  The delivery was timely and the TV is working great.  Anyone looking for a TV I would definately say: Go To amazon.com and you will be very satisfied with your product and your service.  I have really enjoyed my TV after making the purchase.  I am really thrilled how the picture is coming out.  The Football games are Great.

756425,4,6304007647,"I am reviewing the original red box set. I have checked out the newer box sets and was not impressed with either of them. If you are a fan of the series there is no need for me to tell you to buy any of these sets of Rocky films. The first film is the best by far with each installment going slightly downhill there after.

The entire series is entertaining overall and if I were to recommend any set I would tell you to look for the red box set cheap until a better set comes along. I'm sure there is another box set coming out with the newest installment included.

My ratings for each film are:

1) Rocky - 5 stars
2) Rocky II - 3 stars
3) Rocky III - 4 stars
4) Rocky IV - 2 1/2 stars
5) Rocky V - 2 stars

756457,4,6304007647,"I picked up the ""Rocky Anthology"" when it was on super-sale because getting five movies, including an Oscar winner for Best Picture, for under $20 is a pretty good deal.  My assumption was that they were pushing this anthology to make room for the updated one that will include the sixth and ""absolutely"" last final  movie.  Yes, I understand that subtle psychological pressures are at play so that one day I will end up getting ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Balboa/dp/B000N4SHPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky Balboa</a>"" as well, thereby completing my collection, but I am okay with that because I liked the new ending to the saga a lot more than the old ending.

Ironically, this ""Rocky Anthology"" is not for the die hard fans of the series, because in terms of DVD extras all you really get with each film is the trailer.  So this collection is more suited for those who like Rocky rather than those who love him.  I am a bit in the middle because I still love the original, which is the least polished of the series but still the best of the bunch and one day I will at least check out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000ICM5MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Rocky"" (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;because that is the one that deserves the all-out treatment. To some extent the sequels have taken some of the luster off of the original: if you message is that you can win without winning, then the rest of the series says, ""Yo, but winning by winning ain't bad neither.""  Anyhow, here is my card on the five films:

""Rocky"" (1976) is the story of a punk club fighter who gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship.  Sylvester Stallone became the third person ever to be nominated for writing and acting Academy Awards in the same year (Charlie Chaplin for ""The Great Dictator"" and Orson Welles for ""Citizen Kane"" were the first two; Welles also got a directing nod and the following year Woody Allen would do the trifecta for ""Annie Hall"").  Stallone lost to Paddy Chayefsky and Peter Finch, both of ""Network,"" but ""Rocky"" scored the big upset and took home the Best Picture Oscar.  Why is this film the best?  Let the man speak for himself: ""Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed, and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.""  The supporting cast earned three Oscar nominations and getting Bill Conti to do the music was the final masterstroke.  My only complaint with this movie is Apollo Creed is out on his feet before the bell rings and the ref should have called the fight (5.0 Stars).

""Rocky II"" (1979) proved there was going to be a rematch after all.  I say this in the theater, first show on opening day, and we were all screaming during the fight at the end like we were in the arena.  Stallone starts directing these movies at this point and while the patented ""Rocky"" formula is already becoming obvious, he does pay attention to the psychology of Rocky and Apollo that forces them back into the ring.  Automatic deductions for all that damn slow motion during the fight, especially the final falls (4.2 Stars).

""Rocky III"" (1982) is the slickest of the bunch and the most entertaining film in the series.  Yes, once again we have the end of the previous film at the start of the next one, but the montage contrasting the successful Rocky with the ascendant Clubber Lang, who is genuinely scary, is really nice.  The scene with Hulk Hogan is a hoot and even though Stallone is going through the numbers again the fights are all short, sweet, and to the point (4.5 Stars).

""Rocky IV"" (1985) is a painfully obvious message film.  James Brown feels good in this one, but he is out of the movie before it starts to come apart.  My problem is not with the ideology of this film and Rocky's plea for peace, but with the contrast between Drago's steroid induced strength and Rocky's run up the mountain training technique.  A punch from Drago has an impact of almost a half-ton.  I have no problem believing that the guy cannot take a bunch, but I cannot believe that Drago's haymakers do not take off Rocky's head, or at least tear his brain lose (3.5 Stars).

""Rocky V"" (1990) finally deals with the brain damage that Drago must have caused, and throws in Rocky losing his fortune.  Both of these are very real concerns for former boxers.  Rocky trains young Tommy Gunn, ignoring his own kid in the process, as a way of reliving his former glory.  When the kid betrays him, the two end up brawling on the street.  I can accept that Rocky knows how to be a street fighter, but I draw the line at being able to fight when you have a concussion.  The humanity that drew us to the character in the original is gone, and not in a transcendent way.  However, I will give Stallone that he certainly plays out the character's flaws (3.3 Stars).

For those doing the math that works out to a 4 star rating on average, which is what you see above.  A key factor seems to be the more punishment Rocky takes in the ring the less successful the film ends up being, but then if you want really realistic fights go watch ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/B00062IVKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>.""  I did one ""Rocky"" movie a day for five days and while my chances of watching ""IV"" and ""V"" again are slim and none, ""Rocky"" and the first two sequels will certainly get trotted out from time to time.",1184630400,,5667,4.836269430051813

756632,4,6304007647,"The Rocky series is one of the most timeless I've ever seen.  The story of the underdog boxer from Philadelphia getting a shot at the heavyweight title was a concept that alone gives one a reason to keep watching.  After all, who doesn't like to pull for the underdog? It has that suspense quality of sports but also combines the captivating story behind it, which leads to a very entertaining experience.

Now, I should also say that I agree with the people who say that the series was milked to death near the end and Rocky V was one of the most putrid attempts at entertainment I've ever seen, but the rest still has a lot of appeal.

Particularly, Rocky II and III are my favorites, because they do a lot to expand upon what has already happened in the original film.  Rocky's rematch with Appolo Creed is something that you almost expected at the end of the first movie, and seeing him take on an incredible challenge in Clubber Lang (Mr. T) in Rocky III reinstates that ""pull for the underdog""  quality.  Rocky IV, for the most part, is just extra fluff, and a lot of it is rather cheesy and unrealistic, but it does put a nice spin on the USA vs. USSR rivalry at the time, so it is still a nice film to watch after you've gotten through the first three.

Bottom line, even though Rocky V is horrible, you're better off buying the complete set than buying the DVDs individually.  There aren't any bonus features, but you can't beat the $35 price tag.  You're lucky if you can buy 3 of them individually for that amount of money, and then you wouldn't have this nice unified set.",1173052800,3,1584,4.3938356164383565

756965,1,6304007647,"When I saw that the Rocky Anthology - which originally came out in 2004 (look it up on Amazon, it is still available for order) - was being re-released, I was excited because I figured it would finally include special features for all the films. You see, this is the THIRD time they have packaged the entire series together - first in 2000 when the original Special Edition of the first film came out, then again in 2004 when the entire series was re-released with hi-def picture, and now again.

But guess what? There are no special features on the discs.

Which wouldn't bother me on the sequels - but when ROCKY: SPECIAL EDITION has just come out (with two discs and a free ticket to see Rocky Balboa), I consider it a major rip-off to find out the box set doesn't include any of the bonus material from this two-disc edition. They both came out on the same day, yet this Anthology was created without the inclusion of any of the other edition's extra features.

Essentially this is the EXACT same box set as the one from 2004, with identical artwork (the tagline on the back of the box is even the same), only this newer 2006 edition has smaller cases inside (those new, tacky, plastic snap-cases that TV shows are often issued with).

So, if you bought the last Anthology box set, skip this and just buy the Special Edition of the first film, which is also available now and has far better packaging and bonus features.

If you don't own the anthology already, I'd still recommend waiting for the price to drop and just get the Special Edition of Rocky.",1165363200,81,1558,4.491166077738516

The transfers are HD quality and they look fantastic seeing as many of these films were made like 20 years ago or longer!  They are in 1.85:1 ratio which is perfect for widescreen TV's ( like mine ). The sound is good, not great but certainly good enough.  The DVD's are single-disc versions which is perfectly OK with me. Extra discs get too much attention with DVD sets, in my opinion.  I mean...who the heck needs commentary on Rocky movies?  Just watch them and enjoy!

The only snag is that 5th film is completely worthless and this DVD can be thrown out or used as a drink coaster.  The nice thing is that price is basically making you pay just $8 bucks or so for each film OR $10 for each of the first 4 films and then they throw in Rocky 5.

756971,5,6304007647,"The Rocky Anthology, follows the story of an oldfashioned American hero.
Many people think that the Rocky movies are all about boxing, but they aren't just about that. They follow the life of a normal human being, called Rocky Balboa who strugles with life. You see him find romance, you see him struggeling to fit in society, you'll see him trying to find work, and to find luck. All five Rocky films are a great continuation of each other. Where the last movie ended, the next takes of, sometimes just minutes after the last one's ending, which is fantastic!

Rocky
5 out of 5 stars
The beginning of the story. It remains the strongest in the series, and won an oscar back in 1977 for best film. It has great drama, fantastic fights, and a perfect story, written by Sylvester Stallone himself. With great acting from Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith this movie is defenitly worthwhile.

Rocky II
4 out of 5 stars
This one is made in the same style as ""Rocky"" and is almost as strong. This time, besides written, also directed by Sylvester Stallone himself. The story continues with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) wanting a rematch of Rocky. But Rocky has just said the boxing goodbye. But still his heart says something else...
This movie also deals with Rocky's fame and how he handles his money. Great chapter in the Rocky Anthology, with the entire cast of part one returning.

Rocky III
4 out of 5 stars
This chapter changed the Rocky series. Next to the great music score of Bill Conti, there is also a popsong called ""Eye of the Tiger"" mixed in the film, which gives the movie a different feel than the other previous two. Also, Rocky is now famous and rich. He doesn't live the hard life anymore, but the easy life, which also gives a different feel than ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky II""
Still, the action, the romance and the feel is great. With a new enemy played by the famous Mr. T, this Rocky chapter is simply entertaining fun! Just like II, directed and written by Sylvester Stallone.

Rocky IV
4 out of 5 stars
Being the weakest link in the Rocky Anthology, ""Rocky IV"" is still watchable and very entertaining. In this chapter Rocky has to battle a Russian called Ivan Drago, aka Death from above (the movie will explain that name) Rocky travels to Russia to fight this man, putting everything he has on the line.
The music was not composed by Bill Conti this time, but by  Vince DiCola, which gives a less dramatic, but still a fun score to the film. There are more popsongs in the movie now than ever before. But the scene where Rocky thinks about his life while the song ""There is no easy way out"" is played is a very strong moment in the Rocky Anthology. Also, the fightscenes are maqnificent!
Again directed and written by Sylvester Stallone.

Rocky V
4 out of 5 stars

Rocky, now stopped with fighting, becomes a manager of a new hotshot in the boxing world. This movie is entertaining, just like the rest. It's a great continuation of the story. This movie was directed by John Advilsen, the director of the first Rocky, but still written by Stallone.
Many Rocky fans say this is a bad film. I can't understand that. It's a great film, with fantastic acting. I think they were just not happy with Rocky not fighting in the ring.
So ignore the bad critism, cause this one is worth it!

The Rocky Anthology is true enjoyment, not just for boxing fans, but also for moviegoers and people who like to be entertained. Once again: Rocky is not just about boxing. It has a dramatic backdrop. One of the great things of the movies is that the caracters develop during every movie. For example, the caracter of Adrian (Talia Shire) is transformed from a unsure, shy woman into a beautiful strong woman, which is great to experience. Sylvester Stallone has done a perfect job creating this caracters and the story of the man that has become a true symbol in the movieworld.

So, are you willing to go that distance together with Rocky? Then watch these movies and ENJOY!
Go for it!",1155686400,3,4020,4.556786703601108
756972,5,6304007647,"I own an HDTV, and the transfers are EXCEPTIONAL!  I am extremely pleased with the newfound picture and sound quality of the discs.  The transfers are cinematic and vivid, even for their time.

While I love having features on my DVDs and would have LOVED to see more from that part of the anthology, THE MOVIES are the things I watch over and over again, NOT the features.  And with that said, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  It's worth it just for the HD original Rocky, but there are great improvements in the next 3 as well.  The box says Rocky 5 is the same - not that you'd ever want to watch it anyway.",1155600000,2,618,4.239316239316239
757043,5,6304007647,"Okay first of all there is simply no way that a person can just watch one Rocky movie, after you see the first brilliant film of the series you will definatly want to see the other ones, though the original Rocky is the only momumental film of the Rocky series the other 4 are not to be glanced over.

Rocky- ***** stars, A+

Obviously a classic, it's argueably the best sports movie ever created, the heart of the movie is firmly established, the acting is flawless and the screenplay is near perfect but the thing that truelt seperates ""Rocky"" from good movies is that it inspires you more than any film in history in my veiw.

Rocky 2- ****, A-

Though not as good as the first it still manages to deliver  alot of fun the is basically just a direct follow up to the 1st, Apollo Creed is again Rockys opponent, his performance along with Stalone sets up a very good and nearly as inspiring sequel.

Rocky 3- ***1/2, B+

Clubber Lang joins the cast of Rocky 3 pLayed by Mr. T and just a superb job of being Rockys Hated Rival, all together not as inspiring but still quite alot of fun, I love that they kept Apollo around to trian Rocky his charactor along with Mr. T's really carried this 3rd installment.

Rocky 4- ****, A-

This 4th film is the Rocky series was made around that same time as the cold war so as you can imagine, a Russian stars as the enemy this time. In my opinion this is the 2nd best one behind ""Rocky"". I have actually seen this more times than I have seen the original 'Rocky"", Apollo's death at the hands of the Russian really riles you up for a fun time, not only is it Rocky vs. Draco (the Russian) but it also makes you get a feel that it is The U.S.A vs. Russia. Great Sequel.

Rocky 5- **1/2, C+

The only ""Rocky"" films that is not inspiring what so ever, the main reason is because Stalone no longer plays the fighter but now a trainer, the fighting goes to the streets for Rocky is this dissapointing sequel.

Dont forget to watch out for Rocky #6 which should be coming out in 2007 starring Stalone as the trainer, lets hope it is better than #5!",1150329600,3,2081,4.2405063291139244
757044,4,6304007647,"The Rocky Series is one of my most favorite movie sets of all time.  I love the sport of boxing as well, that is what drew me to Rocky.  I know that realisticly speaking, in a real boxing match with Rocky involved in it, the fight would have been stopped within 3 rounds in all of his important matches.  I guess what I love about the series, is that Rocky never gives up, and always gives his all in his matches, no matter how bad he is losing.  Rocky is a true testoment to many people who have been counted out in many situations, but always found away to make believers out of nay sayers.",1143590400,4,592,4.121739130434783
757045,5,6304007647,"I love these movies, with the exception of 5. I can watch 5 but it doesn't hold a candle to the others. Yes Rocky 4 is corny as all hell but remember, this was 1985 during the cold war. The height of the Reagan years, patriotism was abundant. The first Rocky movie is just a great sleeper movie. It kind of stands alone among the series, being the first of course and also being directed by John G. Avildsen and not Stallone. Though Rocky 2 had a lot of the feel of the first one, I've always thought of Rocky 2 as just an extention of number one. The fight sequence in Rocky 2 is awesome in my humble opinion. The climactic fight in the first movie seems somewhat lackluster now, with the exception of the 14th and 15th rounds, after all of the other movies with Stallone's direction. The first movie does the typical 1st and 2nd round then on to the montage throughout the subsuquent rounds up to the 14th. The montage moves along VERY briskly. Rocky 3 gives us two short fights and the classic Hulk Hogan (Thunderlips) segment. This movie put Hogan and Mr. T on the map. Mr. T almost steals the show in this movie as Clubber Lang. I was 10 when this one came out and i remember eating this up. Must have seen it in the theatre like 5 times. Rocky 3 is not as corny as 4 is. I won't bother with 5. Now who's not excited to see Rocky 6? Actually it's going to be called Rocky Balboa, I think that is a smart move. He knows this is REALLY the last one (we think?) so why put any more numbers next to the name. I can't wait for this, much like we root for Rocky I think we are rooting for Sly to pull this off. I hope he can, in retrospect he now looks back on Rocky 5 and cringes. He wants to right that wrong by doing the last one right. I hope he can.",1142985600,3,1753,4.040229885057471

Seems weird to me and is aggrevating to me because as a collector of rocky products, I feel that I didn't get the best rocky set ever and I really like having art on discs. Yeah, it's weird but thats just what I like.

But on to the good stuff, the movies looked and sounded great. The quality of the movies on dvd is amazing and I would suggest getting the dvd set. It is lacking in special features though, that could have been fixed.

These movies do get less interesting with each follow-up release.  Now, I'm hearing that there is going to be a ""Rocky VI"", simply called ""Rocky Balboa"" probably released in 2007.

I don't know how this is going to work. If Sylvester Stallone choses to continue to play the roll as Rocky Balboa, what is Rocky going to be fighting this time?  Diabetes?

Just like his show, ""The Contender"", I think that this new movie (if Stallone still has the strength and comprehension to pull it off), may only be an indirect approach to try and re-sell the Rocky DVD back catalogue.  That's american commercialism for you.",1137196800,6,768,4.595588235294118

Rocky II: Lovable, heart warming, action packed, stimulating as well, and still inspirational!

Overall: Great movie, as far as sequels go.

Rocky III: Fun, butt kicking, not quite as stimulating as the previous two, sad, still action packed, sometimes predictable, and it has Mr. T!

Overall: (My personal favorite) Will not dissapoint.

Rocky IV: Likable, still predictable, sad, action packed, lack of credibility, heart warming.

Overall: Some like it, some don't (Depends)

Rocky V: Opens some fresh new doors, doesn't compare to previous Rocky films, good idea of going back to the streets of Philly. Brings Burgess Meredith back, sometimes hard to sit through, and action packed.

Overall: Not a bad conclusion! (Some may be dissapointed)

The Boxset it's self is not exceptional.

(This text refers to the Red boxset)

Rocky: (Has some really nice features compared to the others) Has a nice anamorphic transfer to the classic film. Theatrical trailer, audio commentary of the film, tributes to James crabe and Burgess meredith. And more!

Rocky II: No anamorphic transfer (Bad idea), theatrical trailer of the film. Yep, that's all!

Rocky III: Nice anamorphic transfer, theatrical trailer.

Rocky IV: No anamorphic transfer (Great idea... Not!) And a theatrical trailer.

Rocky V: Good anamorphic transfer! With trailer.

The answer is No.  Dont get me wrong, I am the biggest fan of the Rocky movies, I wouldnt be the person I am today had these movies not been made, but the Dvds are given no justice.

Rocky

1. A decent commentary, where we can actually hear what the cast and crew are actually saying, since on this one you can barely hear it.

2. Screen tests of Stallone, Talia Shire and Carl Weathers

3. Deleted Scenes, Outtakes

4. A creating the score documentary with Bill Conti

5. Possible multiple angles of the fight sequence between Apollo Creed and Rocky

Rocky II

1. A feature length commentary by cast and crew

2. An all new 'making of' documentary

3. Fight tests, outtakes, deleted scenes

Rocky III

1. A feature length commentary by cast and crew

2. Eye of the Tiger music video

3. A 'making of' documentary featuring interviews

4. fight and screen tests of Stallone and Mr. T

Rocky IV

1. Feature length commentary

2. A 'making of' documentary

3. Interview with Dolph Lundgren

4. Deleted scenes, outtakes

5. Creating the score documentary featuring Vince Di Cola

6. The original extended version of Hearts on Fire, as it is in the film

7. Training footage, behind the scenes

Rocky V

1. Feature length commentary by cast and crew

2. A 'making of' documentary

3. Tommy Morrison screen tests

4. Street fight out takes, deleted scenes

Bonus disc

1. An all-new documentary looking at the success of all five Rocky movies, and audience response

2. DVD-rom features

ROCKY III-This was 4th....I'm not a big fan of Mr. T.....and it was a bit much.

ROCKY IV-The best of the five....this one really was a great movie, including the music, the scene where he's driving as ""No Easy Way Out"" is playing, and when he and Paulie get off the plane in Russia....this movie made Survivor's career with 2 big songs.  Love this one!!!!!

ROCKY V-This was 5th......i didn't like Tommy Gunn in the least and Rocky was getting burned out.

Can't wait to see number VI!!!!!",1105228800,4,813,4.482993197278912

Durring the final fight the Russian characters speak in there native language. In the original movies (VHS), the subtitles let you know what is being said. For this dvd release, the subtitles have been forgoten. It wouldn't be so bad, but it is a GREAT part in the movie!

I have been trying for quite some time now to get ahold of MGM about this and have not gotten anywhere yet. I urge everyone who reads this to contact them and see if we can get something done about this. Thanks.

It was basically watching vhs only on a CD. Every film was grainy and blurry. I am so happy that MGM is remastering these classic films with DTS and 5.1 sound. They Deff.derserve this treatment. I am not anry re buying this collection because it is worth every penny. I know MGM wwon't let us Rocky fans down! The bonus disc is also very tempting. Good bnous material!

ROCKY 2 - Rematch against Apollo is very entertaining, good training scenes, and run through Philadelphia is classic. Love when Adrian tells Rocky to when upon awakening.

ROCKY 3 - Probably my least favorite in the series but still wildly entertaining. Mr T. is great. The final fight scene is well done too.

Rocky 4 - Critics didn't like it, but I did. I found the revenge theme brought something new to the series. Classic scenes iclude the staredown between Rocky and Drago after Apollo's death, Rocky's drive to the song ""No Easy Way Out"" and the final fight scene. We really get to see Rocky's heart and bravery in this movie, when he tells Adrian to beat him, the Russian will have to kill him.

Rocky 5 - My second favorite. Great idea of bringing Rocky back to his routes. The scene in Mickey's gym is saddening but extremely well done. They reuse the quote from Mickey in the end perfectly, when Rocky is down, and Mickey appears saying ""Get up you son of a b**** cause Mickey loves you."" The street fight is extremely well choreographed and probably the most realistic fight in the series.

Rocky 2=The best of the Rocky series, this is the one that shows Rocky & Adrian's marriage, having a son & how the people have started to love Rocky for what he was able to do in Rocky 1, this also corrects the two mistakes of the first film, it seems exactly the right length and Rocky wins the title and accomplishes everything he is able to accomplish, 9/10

Rocky 3=This could have been the perfect way to end The Rocky Series which could have been called The Rocky Trilogy, Rocky after having won 10 title defenses has turned soft and doesn't know it & is more confident than ever, then he gets challenged by a real contender(Mr. T.) then he gets beat and loses Mickey and eventually finds out who he is again and gets his revenge and even gains a friendship with Apollo Creed, it would have been a perfect end to a great series but noooooooooooooo, they had to make these next two embarassments, 8/10

Rocky 4-This one wouldn't have been that bad if it wasn't basically a remake of Rocky 3, this time Apollo dies and Rocky wants revenge on the Russian boxer who causes it, people think he has no shot but somehow he wins, i guess this was a feel good movie when it came out since it was when there was a lot of tension between Russia & The U.S. but now it is hardly relatable and this movie was pretty pointless, 5/10

Rocky 5-omg, this one makes Rocky 4 look like the best movie ever made, Rocky has brain damage from the fight in Rocky 4 and keeps having flashbacks of Mickey so he trains some random bum who wins the title and then turns on him and then Rocky fights him in the streets and then he makes up with his son who likes wearing ear rings, all in all this is an embarassment to the Rocky series, 2/10.",1091232000,,1981,4.191601049868766

757271,5,6304007647,"American classics only come along once in awhile. Films like Star Wars, The Godfather, and The Terminator are among many. Sometimes you say to yourself, ""If that movie never existed, it would have a real effect on culture today."" And you're quite right. Star Wars brought us immortal lines like ""Luke, I AM your father."" and ""May the force be with you."" The Godfather brought the American fascination with the mafia to life. Just think, No Godfather, No Sopranos. And The Terminator established Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron's careers as well as the ""technology gone wrong"" and ""I'm from the future"" genres. Yes, films like these have believe it or not had an effect on everyone. And who can forget the world's sporting people. Everyone who participates in sports has to train hard and balance their personal lives with their professional lives. When I played basketball in high school, I had to. And we all need something to motivate us. To drive us. And being a film fanatic, I got my inspiration from a movie. That movie Was Rocky. Sylvester Stallone's masterwork series that showed us the stages of a man's life through his sport of boxing. From his one shot that put him on the map (Part 1), to his rematch that won him a world title (Part 2), to a rise and settlement, loss, and redemption (Part 3), to a burning vengeance (Part 4), to a retirement, betrayal, and final fight(Part 5). This series shows us that you can be the poorest, dumbest guy in the country, and become a legend just by taking your one chance. Now these movies are on DVD in a beautifully crafted boxed set. Now you can enjoy one man's journey from zero to hero anytime with a great DVD transfer and good special features on the first disc only (didn't understand that one.). This movie can change your life. Now, I recommend the first Rocky over them all because it's very realistic and humanistic. I recommend Rocky 2 as a good sequel with a shocking conclusion. Rocky 3 was the best sequel not only because of the performances of Hulk Hogan and the talented Mr. T, but because it shows how fame can cloud your mind and how putting bitter rivalries and materials behind to regain your drive can help you overcome. Rocky 4 was my least favorite not only for a far fetched storyline and that damned robot, but because it lost it's humanism to go for the revenge plot. Plus it was Stallone's blatant ""let's end the Cold War"" peace offering.  It was saved by good performances, a great fight sequence, a cool villianous contender, and good 80's music. It also screws up the timeline of the story a bit. Rocky 5 regained the humanism and returned Rocky and Adrian back to their roots and it was good because it was different. Rocky had one fight, and it was one hell a fight- on the street. Plus it showed how quick trusting someone else in the fighting game can destroy you. These movies are all good but if you have to see any of them I rank them 1,3,2,5,4.",1088812800,2,2943,4.5633270321361055
757272,4,6304007647,"Let me start by saying that Rocky is my favorite movie series of all time.  I won't give a short description of each movie since many reviewers have already done so.
My ratings of each movie:
ROCKY 1: 5/5; This is definitely the best movie in the series.
ROCKY 2: 4.5/5; Just about as good as the first one.
ROCKY 3: 4/5; This movie was OK.  A little too 80's, but still a good movie.
ROCKY 4: 4.5/5; Not as good as the first one, but better than number 3.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's a little short.  1 & 2 are 2 hours long, while this one is about 90 minutes, so it's over too soon.
ROCKY 5: 3/5;  Not a bad movie, but my least favorite of the series.  I kind of felt that this sequel was a bit unnecessary.  It doesn't really help the series in any way, but I don't think it hurts it either.
Now that I've given my opinion of the movies, let me give my opinion of the DVD's:
ROCKY 1: Great picture quality, and great bonus features.  I love watching the interview with stallone about the movie and it's nice watching Stallone and Carl Weathers practicing the fighting sequence.  I also enjoy the audio commentary.
ROCKY 2: OK picture.  It doesn't seem like they tried at all to clean up this movie.  Also, there are just a few scenes where the audio sounds strange (when Rocky proposes) and the sound is fine on the VHS.  Also, NO SPECIAL FEATURES!  There have to have been scenes that were cut out, interviews, photos, SOMETHING!
ROCKY 3: Great picture and sound quality.  But just like number 2, NO SPECIAL FEATURES!
ROCKY 4: Good sound, again it doesn't seem like they even attempted to clean up the picture and, again, NO SPECIAL FEATURES!
ROCKY 5: Great picture, great sound.  Only one complaint.  Can you guess what it is?  NO SPECIAL FEATURES!
All in all, I love this series and I am so glad that it is on DVD; I just think they could have put more effort into releasing it.  I mean, this is an MGM series.  I always thought that Paramount and Warner Brothers were the only companies that put hardly any effort into their DVDs.",1088640000,3,2069,4.286082474226804

I simply cannot see how anyone, especially any man, could not love these films.  I watch these films and I want to go run 5 miles, even if its the middle of the night.  The depiction of Rocky is so dead on.  He is just an everyday South Philly guy and Stallone has the South Philly slang and accent down to a tee.  I love the street corner guys singing doo wop and the run through the Italian Market is awesome.  This is just a great series, and its amazing that Stallone wrote this screenplay in like two days, after watching Chuck Wepner fight Muhammad Ali.  CLASSIC.",1082073600,,683,4.207692307692308

757276,5,6304007647,"This is my interpretation of the five Rocky movies including the stories, my opinion about the movie and box-office results.
ROCKY (1976) - 117,000,000$ domestically
This movie is the story about a small-time Philadelphia club fighter named Rocky Balboa, who doesn't seem to get any luck. Though he works as a collector for a second-rate loneshark, he fights in clubs for mainly nothing. He meets Adrian, the girl who works at a pet shop, for whom he falls in love. Adrian's brother, Paulie is always bothering Rocky to give him a job as a collector and Mickey, his trainer gets him out of the gym. So, everything seems to be going bad for Rocky, until the Heavyweight Champion Of The World, Apollo Creed picks Rocky to fight him since he can't get any good challenger for the fight. Rocky jumps at the chance to make something of himself and his whole life becomes a million-to-one shot.
This is the original movie that started it all. It won the 1976 Best Picture Oscar and picked up two more Oscars. Sylvester Stallone became a star around the world and was nominated as Best Actor at the Academy Awards. What is so good about this movie, is the script. Sylvester Stallone wrote it himself for 23,000$ and it was shot with a small budget of one million dollars. This movie is about courage, love and believing in yourself. It is the ultimate feel-good movie that has been copied so many times since it's release. If you haven't seen the original Rocky, you haven't seen anything.
ROCKY II (1979) - 71,000,000$ domestically
After going the distance with the Heavyweight Champion Of The World Apollo Creed and losing by unanimous decision, Rocky decides to retire. He gets married with the love of his life and with the money he made with the fight, he buys a house, a car, some new clothes and stuff for the house. He then learns that Adrian is pregnant. So, Rocky, having spend all of his money from the fight, has to make some new. He tries to make some commercials, but he can't read and blows the whole thing. He then learns to read and tries to find an office job, but his efforts come to nothing. Rocky finally gets a manual job at the Philadelphia meat house, but loses his job. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed wants to get a rematch with Rocky Balboa to prove that Rocky is just a lucky club fighter, but he knows that Rocky has retired, so he sets out to challenge Rocky on TV. Rocky sees Apollo's challenge and knows that he has to put his gloves back on and prepare for the fight of his life.
This movie was very hard to write, because Sylvester Stallone had to come up with a story as good as the first one. Though it doesn't have the charm of the first one, it's totally entertaining and is a very good follow-up to one of the most-acclaimed movies of all-time. Sylvester Stallone wrote, directed and stars in this powerful sequel that was shot with a budget of 8 million$. If you loved the original, you gotta see this one.
ROCKY III (1982) - 125,000,000$ domestically
This movie takes place three years after Rocky won against Apollo Creed and became the Heavyweight Champion Of The World. Rocky, then, scored ten consecutive wins, earned millions of dollars and became famous around the world. Then, Rocky meets the ferocious #1 Challenger, Clubber Lang and learns that all of his fights since his win from Apollo Creed are set-ups for him to win. Rocky decides to fight Clubber Lang, but he loses the fight by K.O. in Round 2 and loses the title. It is clear that Rocky has lost his edge, but when former Heaweight Champion Apollo Creed offers to train him, Rocky must accept and go back to his roots and prepare for a rematch with Clubber Lang for the Heavyweight Championship Of The World.
This movie is probably the most entertaining of the series. It has lots of action and it's really a good movie to watch if you have to regain trust in yourself. The movie is at the same time, exciting, sad and funny. Sylvester Stallone did a good job at writing, directing and acting in the movie. Mr. T is perfect as a Mike Tyson type-fighter. Rocky III is truly a great movie.
ROCKY IV (1985) - 127,000,000$ domestically
After regaining the heavyweight title from Clubber Lang, Rocky is proudly the champion for a second-time. Then, Soviet fighter Ivan Drago comes to Philadelphia in hope to fight Rocky Balboa, but it's Apollo Creed who wants to make a comeback and fight Ivan Drago. After the tragic lost by Apollo Creed, Rocky accepts to battle the 261-pound fighter and sets out to Russia to train for what is gonna be the most-challenging fight of his life.
This movie is again very good. It has lots of action, some good 80's rock music and the final fight is truly the best of all the Rocky movies. Sylvester Stallone wrote, directed, and stared in the fourth chapter of the Rocky saga.
ROCKY V (1990) - 40,000,000$ domestically
After wining against Ivan Drago in Russia, Rocky returns to Philadelphia as the champion, but things are about to get ugly when Rocky finds out he lost all of his money. To make matters worst, the injuries that Rocky substained from the fight forces him to retire. So, Rocky, Adrian and his son Rocky Jr. move back to the old South Philadelphia neighborhood. There, Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, a young fighter who wants to be trained by Rocky. Tommy Gunn rises to national prominance and betrays Rocky by going with promoter George Washington Duke. After Tommy becomes the Heavyweight Champion Of The World, he challenges Rocky to a fight. That's when Rocky knows he has to fight once again.
The problem with this movie is that it doesn't have the same big fights as in the other ones. Rocky fights in the street at the end of the movie for nothing and loses all of his money. Though the movie failed at the box-office, it remains a great tale of life after the crowd stops cheering and the glamour goes away.",1068940800,3,5846,4.5685714285714285

757338,3,6304007647,"These movies are really a part of popular culture.  While they are often looked at as ""guy"" movies, quite a few of us Ladies enjoy Sly Stallone as the Italian Stallion!  Allow me to take a brief look at each film:
Rocky I:  Must I say the first is the best?  This is a very well-written movie, and also well acted.  Stallone received two Academy Award (aka Oscar) nominations.  Works like a charm after all these years.  5 stars (out of 5)
Rocky II:  This began the wholly unnecessary- yet always entertaining- string of sequels.  This is nearly a remake of the first film, pitting Rocky against Apollo Creed yet again.  Still a great fight sequence, and lots of soapy drama.  3 stars
Rocky III:  Here is where the formula really took hold- arguably the most influential of the series, as far as spawning copycats (like The Karate Kid, to name but one).  Stallone essentially stops playing Rocky and plays a version of himself.  Much slick and glossier than it's predecessors, this remains extremely entertaining- holding up to repeated viewings probably better than Part II.  3 1/2 stars
Rocky IV:  Pure formula.  The untimely demise of a main character...  The requisite songs by Survivor... The obligatory ""big argument"" with wife Adrian... Ultimately still watchable, but threadbare.  The Russian vs. U.S. antics are laughable.  1 1/2 stars
Rocky V:  Surprisingly strong entry, much better than Part IV, possibly even III!  Stallone re-enlists original director John G. Avildsen and sends Rocky back to his old Philly neighborhood and breaks from the tried and true formula, managing to inject some new life into the series and go out (for now, anyway) on a high.  3 1/2 stars
Special features junkies will find this boxset lacking, as only the first film is given the ""Special Edition"" treatment.  I'm not a big fan of features, but even I have to admit that the 30 minutes of video commentary from Sly was pretty nice.",1050796800,,1924,4.795731707317073
757339,5,6304007647,"The Magic that was Rocky, it lives again in a boxed set! I'm watching them with my kids, who've never seen them. Each time I see the training ""Gonna Fly Now"" segment, I get cold chills and I find myself bobbing up and down with Rock's one hand push-ups...and when he runs the steps victorious, I stand and jump with him. I cry at the end when I hear ADRIAN!
Rocky II does not disappoint, though it doesn't approach III.  Rocky's ""Eye of The Tiger"" when he gets the spark back to defeat Clubber Lang is pure genius. Of course Rocky becomes the larger than life symbol of America in IV, and it's back to the streets in V. I'm looking forward to VI!
Never has their been a more inspirational, motivational, feel good movie. Rocky may well be THE AMERICAN MOVIE.
Did I mention that I love it? The boxed set is the way to go folks. This movie dynasty is an national treasure! I'll watch it with my grandchildren one day.",1047686400,4,915,4.289017341040463
757340,4,6304007647,"The classic Rocky series is on DVD, and as such has successfully achieved the immortality it deserves.  However, for a 5-disc ""Collector's Set,"" these DVDs are so bare-bones and devoid of features that they wouldn't be worth the purchase if they were by themselves unless you were an absolute hardcore Rocky fan.  The only DVD with extras on it is Rocky I.  There is no 'deleted footage' that I noticed integrated into the movie, nor is there any list of deleted scenes.  There are a few short documentaries and that's about it.  Disappointment aside, the transfer of the movies is great.  I'll break down each movie for you:
Rocky I: A small-time bar-room brawler gets his shot at fame and glory when Undisputed World Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) decides to give a local underdog a 'big chance' when the #1 contender for the title suffers an injury.  What follows is a moving and inspiring story about Rocky Balboa, a genuine nobody working as a ""collector"" for a loan-shark.  When Rocky hears of Apollo's challenge, he turns to legend Mickey Goldmill(Burgess Meredith) to help, despite a falling out the two of them had previously.  An exciting and inspiring training montage followed by one of the best boxing matches in fictional history tops off a classic that's been deemd 'An American Tradition.'
Rocky II: Every bit as good as Rocky I, if not better.  Rocky goes the distance...15 rounds with Apollo Creed, something that the champ has never encountered.  After receiving bad press and hate mail based on the decision in favor of Apollo, Creed takes it upon himself to instigate a now retired Rocky to come out and face him one more time.  The confident champion thinks he'll beat Rocky in less than 2 rounds.  But a much more determined and head-strong Rocky proves to be quite a match for Apollo.  Now married to Adrian(Talia Shire) and having recently been gifted a newborn son, Rocky takes his training to the next level in yet another inspiring and energizing training montage, followed by a fight that nearly rivals the first!
Rocky III: Having defeated Apollo and gaining the World Heavyweight title, Rocky has a series of successful defenses for 3 straight years.  However, fame and fortune goes to his head, and Rocky is completely unprepared for a fight with the most brutal and merciless opponent he had ever faced: Clubber Lang(MR. T in his debut movie role).  Beaten within an inch of his life in a humiliating 2 round KO, Rocky experiences a terrible heartbreak as Mickey suffers from a heart attack and passes away.  A much more cool-headed and respectable Apollo Creed is saddened to see Rocky, the man who retired him(and ultimately was created by him), lose heart and give up, and inspires him to rise up against Clubber Lang in a rematch.  Apollo becomes his trainer and helps Rocky regain the 'Eye of the Tiger' to defeat Clubber Lang and recover his glory.  Definitely the last great movie in the series (and fan favorite among many)
Rocky IV: Clubber Lang nearly ended Rocky's career, but an exhibition match with Soviet powerhouse Ivan Drago leaves Apollo Creed dead in the ring, and Rocky overwhelmed with grief.  Rocky goes to Russia to train hard and fight quite possibly the deadliest boxer in the world.  The serires goes downhill from here, as random silliness (such as Paulie's robotic maid)just bring the film's quality down.  Like Sly's other franchise Rambo, Rocky IV is a very anti-soviet film, but it culminates with a patriotic and powerful message that the East and the West can live in peace.
Rocky V: The series hits its lowest point.  Rocky suffers irreversible and possibly terminal brain damage from his fight with Drago.  When he returns home, Rocky finds that Paulie entrusted the family riches to a crooked bookie who loses everything, forcing Rocky into life-long debt, selling everything he owns and moving back to the slums of Philadelphia.  Forced to retire from the ring, a big time promoter in the vain of Don King tries to get him back in, but instead Rocky takes hotshot youth Tommy Gunn under his wing.  Tommy is lured away by the promoter and insults and taunts Rocky, leading to a final street fight.  The film sort of ruins Rocky's fame and glory, returning him to his roots.  It wasn't necessary and could've been done quite differently.
So there you have it...all the DVD's are devoid of extras, other than theatrical trailers.  Rocky I has a few extras but nothing particularly noteworthy.  In any case, if youare even REMOTELY a Rocky fan, do NOT pass this up!  Rocky is indeed an American Tradition and is an inspiring and poignant saga of a man who went from rags to riches in the name of glory and determination.",1046995200,5,4692,4.805728518057285
757341,5,6304007647,"How can you not like Rocky movies? They are some of the most emotionally intense, exciting, fun, and inspirational movies of all time. I love all of them in all their cheesy glory. This boxed set lets you experience any and all of Rocky's great fights any time you want. It's too bad only one of the movies has special features, but doesn't really matter to me since special features often aren't even worth watching.
None of the movies in this series has ever failed to keep me entertained no matter how many times I watch it. Yes, even number 5. Here's a little mini-review of each one:
Rocky 1: This one started it all and is my second favorite film, but technically the best. It won Best Picture for good reason. It's dialogue, acting, storyline, and climax are all brilliant!
Rocky 2: Not my favorite because it is basically the same film as Rocky over again with a slightly different ending. I will admit that the end fight is much improved though. This is my fourth favorite film.
Rocky 3: This one is definitely my favorite! It isn't better than Rocky, but it is more fun the way I see it. This is where the films changed from reality-based drama to fantasy-like action. The transition works well because this movie really knows how to push your buttons as far as entertainment goes. It is also the last movie with dialogue and acting as excellent as the first movie.
Rocky 4: This one is a lot of fun too and is even more ""out there"", but the series seems to be getting tired at this point. There isn't a whole lot of difference, storywise, between this and Rocky 3. They kill off a main character, build up an opponent that seems to be invincible, and throw in some nice training sequences. The only difference is that Mr. T was a better villain than Drago, who has absolutely no personality. This is my third favorite for its great training sequences and fun end battle, but Rocky's character is starting to get unbearably cheesy and the comedy that worked before is not really funny anymore.
Rocky 5: This just proves the fact that the Rocky series has lost its steam. This movie is far from horrible because it still has that Rocky ""goodness"" that really has no description and the story is at least decent in concluding this great series, but this movie is the worst of the series. At many times, Rocky's character is just like a silly cartoon character and the villains weren't anything like what we've seen before. In a bad way. The dialogue has completely gone sour and there is some truly horrible acting in there. You can judge for yourself whether or not this movie is worthy of the Rocky name, but I am willing to say it is since it certainly did entertain me.

757408,5,6304007647,"This ROCKY DVD collection is a treasure to have! In ROCKY, the most memorable scene is: when Adrian makes her way, through the crowd, to the boxing ring as Rocky calls out in despair for her. She enters the ring, right after World Champion, Apollo Creed's decision victory is announced to the captivated audience. Rocky finds his woman, Adrian, and they embrace - as Rocky rejoices in the moment of accomplishing his desired goal....of going the distance against the champion. What a great film! It was most deserving of the 1976 Best Picture Oscar! One of the best films of all time!
  ROCKY II continues the magic of the first classic. 2 memorable scenes: Rocky's run through Philadelphia, passing Independence Hall and sprinting straight to the Museum Of Art - with hundreds of children running behind him! He runs up the, now famous, stairs and ends his pre-fight rally jumping up and down with his under-age fans! The other great scene: Rocky's closing rounds in Super Fight II....Rocky slugs away at Apollo's pulverized face and body; Apollo has no steam left and his gloves are almost hanging to his sides! Rocky hammers away at him, without Apollo countering back, with left hooks....Rocky then unloads a devastating final left punch, - which he throws his entire body into - and floors Apollo, and himself! The excruciating slow motion count, by the referee, begins the suspense of who will get the championship! Rocky and Apollo struggle to get to their feet as the count of 7 arrives....8....9..Apollo slumps and falls down..10! Rocky beats out the count, standing, and has won the fight!!!! Rocky later thanks his manager, Mickey, and declares the victory ""the best night in the history of my life!"" He calls out to Adrian, watching the TV broadcast at home, ""Yo, Adrian....I did it!!!!"" Signifying that he accomplished what she wanted him to do, after her pregnancy....""Win.""
  Rocky III memorable scene: the entire rematch fight against Clubber Lang is an awesome spectacle!!!! Rocky displays a compination of speed and power - never seen before, and overwhelms Clubber! Rocky KO's Clubber, and retains his title!
  Skipping to Rocky V (ROCKY IV was my least favorite): Rocky's return to Mickey's gym, after losing all of his fortune from Paulie's carelessness. Rocky thinks back to when he was training with Mickey for the rematch against Apollo....we see Mickey telling Rocky that, because of him - he had reason to live. This was the most touching moment of these 5 movies. I got emotional when, after handing down Rocky Marciano's gold cuff link necklace to Rocky - Mickey says that the necklace is a reminder, ""an angel on your shoulder"", that when Rocky feels down or is in any trouble - ""this angel will cry out....get up, you s.o.b.....'cause Mickey loves you."" That scene really summarizes the value that Mickey meant to Rocky....the special friendship they shared in and out of the ring, was priceless. Rocky, with a tear rolling down his face, exclaims emotionally: (to Mickey)""you were my angel."" This is one of my favorite scenes of all 5 movies.

757410,5,6304007647,"Keep playing that immortal song. Heaven to my ears! Sylvester Stallone made himself a legend of a genius after writing all five ""Rocky"" works of art. ""Rocky"" was about a struggling boxer trying to earn a living, but his chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, became reality. He trained vigorously and fell in love with the shy Adrian! Yo Adrian! He yelled after fighting Creed. A tribute to the clumsy girl that nobody liked, touching! In ""Rocky II"", 'The Italian Stallion' Rocky Balboa punched more meat and ran up the infamous steps with children to fight in a rematch! Immortal! He barely defeats Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) and says, ""Yo Adrian, I did it!"" Pure Heaven! The next sequel in this historical franchise, ""Rocky III"" had Balboa fight Hulk Hogan and Mr. T! What casting! In ""Rocky IV"", the boxer came out of retirement to avenge the death of Apollo Creed and fought Ivan (too cool for you, Dolph Lundgren). Finally, in ""Rocky V"" the retired boxer street fights Tommy Gunn in the Philadelphia streets! I was astounded with such movie-making, I bought numerous copies of this immortal franchise.

757411,5,6304007647,"The Rocky series is one that gives hope and inspiration to the common man. They are all emotional, and show the life of a 'nobody' who gets the chance to be a somebody and decides to. I have these DVDs and have watched each movie over 5 times.
Rocky: This is the beginning of the saga and my personal favourite. It shows the different stages in his life: his love life, living in a run-down house, his job (""why didn't you break his thumb"") and his career as a boxer. We see how he gets a chance and decides to take the chance and try to be no. 1. The thing in Rocky 1 that shows this the best is, I feel, in the fight itself against the champion Apollo Creed. Both men have taken enormous amounts of punishment and Apollo seems to have given Rocky the final shot. The Italian Stallion is down but gets up at about an 8 or 9 count. Rocky is desperate and Apollo stands there and just shakes his head, not believing that Rocky is still going. This shows the desperation of the Stallion, and how he has made the most of his opportunity.
Rocky II: This is a wee bit more predictable than the 1st, but is excellent none the less. Creed has been called a loser so he challenges Rocky to a rematch. In this, you see the emotions of not only Rocky but Apollo Creed too. We see Rocky once again struggle but he fights his way back and takes on Apollo for the title.
Rocky III: Rocky has sold out and has lost sight of the goal of being the best boxer. However, Clubber Lang (Mr. T) has not and he wakes Rocky up. Rocky must once again fight to take back what is his.
Rocky IV: Perhaps one of the most emotional of the series. Rocky avenges the death of his friend and travels to Russia to defend himself, his family, Apollo and the USA! Some would call it propaganda, and it is certainly dated today but it still is a great movie.
Rocky V: This is the weakest of the series. It doesn't feel like a Rocky movie, and there is no definate conclusion. Still, it is not bad and shows Rocky going back to his roots.
I strongly recommend that you check out these DVDs. They make for great viewing that can be watched time and time again!",1019520000,,2122,4.1654501216545015
757412,5,6304007647,"I have seen all the Rocky movies at least a dozen times each. I cannot help but be inspired them despite the implausibility of the latter films in the franchise. I have ordered the 5-disc set already and I am waiting with baited breath for it to arrive. This is how I rate the films. The original Rocky is obviously the crown jewel of this collection which is why, I assume, it is the only one that has received the 'Special Edition' treatment. It is also the only one that attracted significant Oscar attention (Rocky III was nominated Best Song for 'Eye of the Tiger') and it is quite simply, an endearing tale. A down and out part-time boxer part-time loan collector gets a one in a million shot at the world champion. The story is touching and Stallone was born to play Rocky. Rocky did not need a sequel although it did get one. Rocky II is more predictable than its predecessor and it is slightly less touching as the hubris is turned way up. If it worked the first time...By Rocky III the series had lost any sense of credibility and was quite different from how it started. That's not to say that the film is not a guilty pleasure. It is, and worth owning! My least favorite film is Rocky IV and that is simply because the Cold War Reagan-era jingoism just feels dated. It does have the best training montage in the whole series though. I just wish he had not been fighting a 7 foot, 400 lb. Russian comic book character. The final Rocky film is my second to least favorite. It is simply marred by bad acting and horrible music and lack of a climactic ending (the street brawl seems tacked on and inconclusive) although it does try to bring the series 'down to earth' one last time and back to its roots. I highly recommend all of these films though!",1016496000,3,1758,4.379204892966361
757413,5,6304007647,"So many people have written about the things that make the Rocky movies so successful, and I have no doubt that I'll be repeating some of them in my review.  But I have to throw my hat in the ring anyway, so to speak.
Rocky Balboa certainly qualifies as one of the most unique and determined heroes in cinema.  His story is truly an inspiraton to us all.  In the first movie, of course, he starts out with basically nothing, gets a chance to fight Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and loses.  In the second movie, he wins the heavyweight title from Creed in a rematch.  By the third movie, Rocky is basking in the glow of his success; he and Adrienne now have a son.  But Clubber Lang (Mr. T) has been making his way to the top as well, and he challenges Rocky to a match.  Rocky trains hard and tries his best, but his concerns about his manager Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) health make it difficult to concentrate, giving Lang the advantage...and Rocky's title.  With encouragement from Adrienne and his former rival Apollo Creed, who takes over as manager after Mickey's death,  Rocky rediscovers his Eye of the Tiger in the rematch and puts Lang in his place.
In the fourth movie, Apollo is killed in battle by Russian champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).  In one of the most intense boxing matches of the entire series, Rocky finds the ""chink"" in the Russian's seemingly impenetrable armor.  It's worth getting the fourth movie just for that match.
But, by the time of the fifth and final movie, things are quite a bit different. (As I'm writing this, I've just finished watching the fifth one for the very first time.)  Not only do Rocky and his family find out that they're broke, but Rocky seems to be suffering from brain damage as a result of his fight with Drago. He becomes a manager for a new young fighter, Tommy Gunn (upsetting his son quite a bit), who allows his ego to cloud his judgement, thus luring himself into the sleazy side of the boxing business.  When Tommy gets a shot at the heavyweight title, the audience is already in a bad mood because Rocky isn't there on stage with him.  But when Tommy takes the title in just over three rounds, the audience is REALLY in a bad mood; at least Rocky had class.
Rocky and Tommy end up resolving their differences in a street fight, and for several agonizing minutes it looks like it could be the end...but Rocky has the spirit of Mickey with him, and for the fourth time, the Italian Stallion wins, proving that he's still a champion and always will be, even after fifteen years.
Whenever I watch these movies I can still feel the excitement of seeing them for the first time.  When the odds are stacked against him, even in the face of several brushes with death (Tommy Gunn makes Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang look like  pussycats somtimes), he still manages to triumph.
I love you, Rock...you the man!",1005955200,4,2866,4.525193798449612
757454,5,6304007647,"This is the ultimate collection. Actually I bought the region 4 version in NZ. It only comes with 3 covers, but all 5 discs. I love the Rockys. Actually I guess I love them all. Now about each disc.
Rocky 1: Special Edition- Great transfer, great movie and great Dolby Digital 5.1 mix. It's a true classic, with everything in it. Great Video Commentary by Stallone. Must Buy! Recommend!
Rocky 2- Not very good transfer, still ok though. Sound quality not that good, but like I said about video transfer, it's ok! A good enjoyably film anyway.
Rocky 3- A Dolby Digital 5.1 transfer that's ok. I like it, but Eye Of The Tiger doesn't sound in DD 5.1. I can remove the vocals on DD 5.1 discs, but in Rocky III, I can't remove the vocals like in Rocky IV. But an entertaining movie, Excellent!
Rocky 4- The best Rocky ever, the best music and I love the song 'Heart's On Fire', I reckon it's the best Rocky theme ever. Great training montages and great last fight. Man I love the music!! Dolby Digital 5.1, thumbs up.
Rocky V- I really like this one. Very entertaining, and I don't know why people don't like this one. I reckon it's one of the best Rockys. Great moments in this, and the credits give good memories. It would've been kool if it was Dolby Digital 5.1.
About the 1.85:1 ratio: I notice that all the Rockys cut of bits on top and bottom with the black bars. It's because it's the director's vision. But they all have 3 formats, Widescreen, Anamorphic and Full Screen. And I love it.",1000512000,4,1491,4.386281588447654
757455,4,6304007647,"If there's any film franchise that's a big-ol'-honkin'-slice of Americana, the saga of Rocky Balboa is it! Sadly, this series has soured me somewhat to real boxing. After watching Balboa take- and give- so many devastating blows from- and to- his many opponents, with very few misses (or clinches), whenever I watch actual matches, I'm rather disappointed by how relatively unexciting they are. They can't hope to match up to the superhuman abilities of Stallone's most-famous persona. Of course, there's also no ear-biting in the 'Rocky' saga, nor scandals concerning the champ's crashing his car into a tree for the umpteenth time, so maybe it's just as well...
In the first go-round, you got the one-in-a-million two-bit club fighter going the distance. It's interesting to note how Stallone's efforts to get this movie made parallels the life of our man Balboa (check out the many documentaries and the commentary track included in this special-edition disc for the details)! One of my favorite extra features is one of the trailers. In it, the narrator states, ""His name is Sylvester Stallone, but you'll remember him as Rocky."" Was that a prophetic statement or what!
Number II's got our lovable loser's second crack at the big rematch. Hey, you know Rock's gotta win it all this time; it's just the way things have to be! And you just gotta love that climactic 'both-guys-going-down-for-the-count' moment!
In III, the champ loses it all and has to regain his edge to get it all back. This is definitely the point in the franchise where the movies go from predominantly drama to predominantly action. Apparently, the switch worked- this bad boy really raked 'em in! It even had an action-figure line. And let's not forget the first big-time big-screen appearances of Mr. T & Hulk Hogan! I pity the fool who says Mr. T doesn't have any acting range! Interestingly enough, both T & the Hulkster ended up being occasional tag-team partners in the WWF following this gig!
Then there's IV, featuring the appeal to Yankee patriotism (not to mention a way to draw in the Rambo-philes) against the big 'bad guy' of the mid-to-late 80s Stallone projects- the Soviets. Wow, Dolph Lundgren is so... stoic. Who knew he had such range? While we're at it, let's kill off one of Rock's close buddies to really get the ball rollin'! Hey, it worked in 'III', why not here?
Finally (and thankfully so), in V the champ lives his past vicariously through his protg, who, thanks to the manipulations of a Don King clone, turns against him. In the end, Rock's gotta throw down with him, just to show 'em who still wears the pants in this little relationship (No, not Adrian; that's an entirely different relationship altogether)!
My only big gripe with this series is a lack of extra features for discs II, III, IV, & V. Only the first movie gets the special edition treatment. I know of at least one scene in IV that was cut from the final release (you can see part of it in the trailer) that I'd like to see in the IV platter. C'mon, MGM/UA, don't leave the Sly-philes in the lurch!

The Rocky movies do not follow this however. Rocky fights back from every bad thing that can possibly happen to someone, his wife gets sick, his manager dies, he losses his title, his friend is killed in a match, the guy he manages turns on him, he gets brain damage and many other destructive events happen to him. He is the true American dream. Buy this set, you won't regret it.",993513600,,550,4.330097087378641
757457,5,6304007647,"I've grown up with the Rocky movies my entire life.  My dad was a boxer and still works out at the Upper Darby Boxing Gym.  Everytime a Rocky film came out he took me.  I don't remember the Original or Part II very well because I was very little, but I do remember my experience with Rocky III.  It blew me away!  Star Trek II was playing at the same time and after we saw Rocky III a million times my dad saw it.  All he could hear was ""Eye Of The Tiger"" playing in the theater next to him and thinking, ""I should've gone to see it again instead"".
The Rocky Saga is something we in Philly take great pride in.  Rocky has always been about ""Heart"" and ""Going the Distance"".  He has inspired millions with his simple but effective tale of an underdog going against the odds, which is what this city stands for.  We always route for the ""David"" rather than the ""Goliath"".
""Rocky I"" is the classic that was hailed by critics and moviegoers alike.  The love story between Rocky and Adrian (Talia Shire) is quintessential and is the core of the film itself.  Stallone's mannerisms give Rocky the quality of a man people can really identify with, and Sly's writing is topnotch.  Simple things, such as feeding his pets (""Heeya go...Heeya ya go.  You wanna see your friend, Moby Dick, huh?"") just add to the layers of brilliance (""Hey, how'dya spell Del Rio?""  ""Look it up in the dictionary, Rock!"").  I love that after the last fight is over and Adrian is running to him, Rocky goes ""Where's your hat?"", because that's how into her he really is.  The cast is wonderful, the film is a triumph.  No movie collector should be without it!
""Rocky II"" continues the story further.  Now married to Adrian, Rocky does his best to make a life for the two of them.  The damage he sustained to his eye from the previous fight against Apollo has pushed him out of boxing and into working at a meat factory.  But Apollo wants a rematch to prove the first fight was a fluke, and puts the pressure on Rocky to fight.  The drama is still there, with a pregnant Adrian, falling into a coma after complications during birth.  I love when he's reading and talking to her while she's in the coma...so touching.  Sure you know how the big fight is going to end but it doesn't matter.  The training montage is great, with kids running with Rocky up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  Strong 2nd effort.  ""Yo Adrian, I did it!""
""Rocky III"" keeps things cooking as we witness Rocky's rise to fame and stardom while at the same time losing the killer instinct that gave him the heavywieght title to begin with.  Plenty of humor and drama alike, with Rocky fighting pro wrestler, Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in a no holds barred fight to the death, only Rocky doesn't know it (""Listen, uhh, after the match, how 'bout if we get a polaroid together, ok?"").  The death of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) effects me everytime I see it.  The scene was done beautifully by Burgess and Stallone.  When I lost someone close to me, I cried the way Rocky cried in that scene, sort of screaming at the same time...""Don't go away!!  We've still got more to do!""  And when Rocky throws his helmet at his own statue, the message is clear.  He thinks he's a fake fighter and has lost his spirit.  Mr. T as Clubber Lang is very convincing as Rocky's opponent.  With the help of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky starts over in the ""old school"" tradition of training.  But it's Adrian who gives him back his spirit.  The final fight rocks.  Truly Inspiring!
""Rocky IV"" is a film aimed more toward the male crowd.  I say that because the love story, though still present, is not as dominant as it was in subsequent chapters.  This one is heavily testosterone laden, with Rocky facing Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) a Russian fighter.  Again, the training sequence is great, with Rocky training in the snow and with farm equitment, while Drago trains with state of the art machines (and steroids).  Great fight at the end (""I see three of him out there!  Hit the one in the middle!"").
""Rocky V"" is of course the only film in the series not to be a box office success.  I personally enjoy the movie, but can understand why most people do not.  I mean after all his hard work and fighting, what is Rocky reduced to?  He loses all his money (thanks to Burt Young's, Paulie) and has to go back to the old neighborhood.  I never really did like this idea.  We like to see our heroes happy and successful at the end of their career, and this just isn't the way you want to see Rocky go.  However the acting is still quite strong, and having Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) play Rocky's son was a stroke of genius.  With all its flaws, I'm still happy to have it as a part of my Rocky Collection!
If you love Rocky, then this Collection is for you.  True, it's sad that only the original film has special features, my favorite being Stallone's video commentary.  But the picture and sound quality look great.  I wish Parts II & IV had cover art on the DVD discs themselves like all the other ones do.  And why did they use a picture from Rocky II as the cover art for original Rocky DVD?  Miss the english subtitles for parts I, III & V, but that's about it.  Really love the box set itself, putting all the cases together gives you the cover of Rocky IV.  A great collection!  ""Go For It!""",992476800,6,5339,4.395301327885598
757458,4,6304007647,"The Rocky movies are beyond question the greatest movies ever made, they pit a million to one man (Sylvester Stallone) against many different scenarios which he must overcome.
Rocky I - Rocky I is my favorite of the 5 movies.  It is a story about Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a club fighter from Philadelphia who is offered a million to one shot to take on the world heavyweight champion of the world (Apollo Creed).  Many people can look beyond the fighting and see that Rocky is not only a great fight movie, but a great love story, and a movie which gives hope to all the people in Rocky's place.
Rocky II - Rocky II is a very good movie, but does not match up to the first Rocky movie.  The fighting continues, the love continues, and the hope continues.  After being taunted by a flamboyant Apollo Creed who wants to prove to the world he really did win against Rocky, Rocky feels the only thing to do is fight.  However, with problems at home, Rocky feels torn.  Another movie which brings a smile to your face as Rocky overcomes the odds as he ends up rematching the champion of the world.
Rocky III - Many people hate Rocky III, and many people love it.  I think it is a great movie, but nothing spectacular.  Rocky has everything after winning the heavyweight championship.  He has fame, glory, and money.  However, the worst thing happened to Rocky that could happen to any fighter, he became civilized.  When A zealous Clubber Lang (Mr. T) challenges Rocky for the title, Rocky is faced with the biggest challenge of his life.  With a great training sequence featuring Rocky being trained by Apollo Creed, Rocky III makes up to be a great movie.
Rocky IV - Russia is now throwing its hand into the ring, the prize ring that is, when the freakish Russian Ivan Drago (Dolph Lungren) takes on the world.  Apollo Creed wants to regain his manhood by taking on the Russian, however, this mistake costs him his life.  Rocky must head to Russia to avenge his fallen friend, and fight for the United States, during a tough time in the world.  Rocky IV is many people's favorite Rocky movie.  I think the reason for that is because it is actually more of a hollywood movie, unlike the other four.  Rocky IV does have the best music, and training sequence in my mind.  It is a great movie.
Rocky V - Many people dislike Rocky V very much.  However, I believe it takes a true Rocky fan to like Rocky V.  It might even be my second favorite Rocky movie.  After losing everything in a financial scandel, Rocky must return back to the slums and live the normal life.  Not only is this hard on Rocky, he also finds out he has brain damage and cannot box again.  When a young fighter with talent Tommy Gunn (real boxer Tommy Morrison) asks Rocky to train him, Rocky gets mixed emotions.  However, Rocky ends up training Tommy to be one of the best boxers of his era.  When an inscrupulous promoter comes into Tommy's life, he gives up Rocky for the fame, and also a title shot.  Still in Rocky's shadow, Tommy feels the only way to become his own man is to defeat his trainer.  The scene at the end ""Tommy Gunn only fights in the ring"" - promoter, ""My ring is outside"" - Rocky, is truly a great moment.  Rocky knows that this isn't about glory anymore, but that this is personal.  Topping off this movie is the great song by Elton John - The Measure of a Man.
The Rocky movies are truly amazing.  Any movie lover should go out and see these movies.",992476800,2,3449,4.4113924050632916

The fight scene at the end is missing the subtitles that go along with the spoken Russian. These were originally found on the VHS, but for some odd reason, were absent from the DVD.  I originally figured that this was because it was the international release of the movie.  However, I was even more disappointed when I popped in the DVD from the boxed-set that I have and found out that the subtitles were left out there as well.  I have the entire set on VHS also.  Why are the subtitles missing?
Otherwise, I am very pleased with the set - the sound and picture quality remind me of why I have the DVDs to replace the VHS tapes.  However, I think I'll be hanging on to the VHS version of Rocky IV for a long time.",991785600,,862,4.1878787878787875

757461,3,6304007647,"This DVD set has all the makings of a good fight: the hype, the anticipation, the great moments, thrills of victory and agonies of defeat.
ROCKY I - Rocky (Stallone) is a street punk turned fighter who earns a once in a lifetime chance to fight the champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It is also the story of how the down and out fighter courts a timid pet store employee, Adriane (Talia Shire). The love story does seem to drag a bit in sections, but the ending of the movie is very satisfying.
There's something raw about how the first Rocky movie is done and if you listen to the director and cast commentary it was filmed with this same unclean edge which makes the film shine in a way that the others in the series just never seem to live up to. Apparently Stallone was just dropped in the middle of the city and started running and they would start filming it. The budget was pretty tight too, so Stallone had to use a lot of friends and family as extra. The camera work is some of the best in any movie I've ever seen. Dark, brooding in all the right places and the lighting doesn't have the hollywood manufactured look.
ROCKY II - Rocky is back in a sequel (a four-lettered word to most people) that should have been made. The whole movie centers around long love scenes of Adriane and Rocky fleshing out their relationship and how the ego-bruised Apollo Creed wants to prove he really beat Rocky Balboa and how Rocky can't seem to cut it doing anything but fighting. About the only truly inspiring moment in this episode is how Rocky finally does take the rematch in the end. The problem is it took wayyyy too long to get to this point.
Also of interesting note, Rocky is showing his first signs of being a battled-scarred fighter. His trainer, Mickey, played by the very talented Burgess Meredith, doesn't want to train him for another fight because Rocky might lose his eyesight. He took quite a beating (which would become Rocky's trademark in the series) in that first fight with Apollo. Unfortunately for Rocky's health -- and storyline -- he goes back into the ring not once, but (in future sequels) many, many times more which makes the overall storyline a bit hard to swallow on the plausibility scale.
ROCKY III - Who can't like Clubber Lang (Mr. T) as a nasty brawler from Chicago that breaks into the third installment of the saga taking down Rocky after he gets too comfortable in being the new champ? There's a neat twist when Apollo comes back and actually trains Rocky.
ROCKY IV - Rocky gets political and fights a blood doped russian, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lungren) in what becomes another movie in the series that goes on too long to get to the point. The beating that Rocky takes in this movie makes you say, ""no way"" more than once.
ROCKY V - Finally a somewhat realistic movie in the saga (since Rocky I) where Rocky has been swindled by his financial people and he's back to living like Adriane and he did in the beginning. It is also the story of how Rocky becomes the trainer of Tommy Gun (real life fighter Tommy Morrison) and displays how sleazy some promoters in the sport can be. The ending is fitting for the series.
Overall this DVD collection is still worth getting (for 5 DVDs it's somewhat of a bargain), but don't expect to enjoy every movie from beginning to end. It's a series that could -- and should -- have been done in 2 or 3 movies instead of 5.
However, with the actor and director commentary, the very well done tribute to Burgess Meredith, and other goodies included with the Rocky I DVD, it still makes it worth adding to your collection. I wish there would have been some extra add-on content for the sequels because part of the fun of buying DVDs is getting the backstory and deleted/extra scenes, but apparently the makers of the DVD set did not feel this was very important beyond the excellent add-on content for Rocky I.

No deleted scenes in any of the films. There was lots of extras on the first Rocky. But the only thing I really enjoyed was the 30 min. Stallone interview. The picture quality on all the films was really the best thing about the box set.

757538,5,6304007647,"Rocky I has the plot of a small-time boxer getting a chance at the big time who wins.  That may not sound like a lot, but that's the outline of the story.  But when you see the movie, you'll realize that it's so much more than that.  The story is interesting in it's elegant simplicity, making you not get bored of the movie.  And the both fights in the film have the most realistic look and act to them.  Some say that other movies are better when it come to fights, but to me everything in the movie has what real fights have.  Even down to the sounds of the punches.  Very impressive.  Rocky II is basically the rematch of former champion Apollo Creed and Rocky.  It is less serious than the first film, but still similar in many ways.  Definitely worth watching.  Rocky III is Rocky fighting Mr. T, loses, then wins after getting help from former rival Apollo Creed.  It even has a bonus fight at the beginning of the film where Rocky fights Hulk Hogan.  It draws back to acting more like the original Rocky than Rocky II.  Rocky IV, my personal favorite, features a Cold War scenario.  Apollo, trying to get another shot at fame, fights the Soviet fighter Ivan Drago and gets killed.  Rocky looks for vengeance and goes east and trains like he never trained before.  Then he fights the Russian in Moscow and beats him in the final round after the coolest battle ever.  It uses slow motion techniques, fading, and the most realistic fight wounds.  When it shows power punches to the faces, blood filled saliva actually flies from their mouths as sweat bursts everywhere.  The only thing that downplays this movie is the kind of weak plot and unrealistic punching sounds.  They sound powerful and cool, but nothing like they would in real life.  Rocky V is my least favorite, but it's still very good, despite the bad reviews so many give it.  Rocky is back in Philadelphia slums because all the brain damage leaves him uneligible to fight anymore.  He trains a powerful, young boxer called Tommy Gun.  Tommy Gun gets corrupted and fights Rocky.  The only things that downplay this movie are the bad musical score, despite the song ""Measure of a Man.""  And the fact there was no ring, no gloves, no nothing.  Only Rocky fighting Tommy Gun.  But it is a nice end to the long series(Even though there are rumors of a Rocky VI)  Personally, I think that the Rocky movies are incredible, even the infamous Rocky V.  They all just have this something about them that makes them great.  Even if you don't know anything about boxing or don't watch a lot of movies, the Rocky series is for you.  It is definitely a collection of films that will stand out in history for years to come.",988416000,4,2679,4.491701244813278

I then watched the interview with Sly and loved his recollections of making this movie.  I then turned on the alternate audio and listened to the commentary from the crew as the movie played.  This was done so well that I could not stop watching the the movies...  My only complaint was that is it was not done in DTS, but only in 5.1 and Rocky 5 was Dolby Digit 2.0.  A timeles classic.  Sure, as we all know, the Rocky's after the original went down hill a bit, they were still enjoyable.

I individually bought 1, 2, and 4, and now I somehow have to dump those if I want to get a boxed set.  I think Rocky 1 and 2 are superb movies, but I have to admit I do feel a little bit of guilty pleasure about enjoying Rocky 4.  Rocky 4 is a more of a Hollywood glamorized version of Rocky that is not in tune with all the other movies.  But Rocky 4 is what introduced me to the Rocky series since it's the first one I saw.  I'm sure that's the situation with some of you that are around 19-23 yr old category.  So I understand why some people say Rocky 4 is the best movie, and for some, Rocky 4 is the worst out of the bunch.
Rocky 3 on the other hand, I still haven't seen to this day.  I'm anxiously awaiting to see the this last movie of the collection, but it's so hard to get my hands on the movie.
Rocky 5.  Some people complain that Rocky 5 is horrible.  I've seen it many times, and I don't see anything wrong with the quality and the dramatics of the film.  But even though people say that Rocky needed to return to the slums where he belongs, because he was never happy with all the money and fame, I still wish that Rocky would have came back financially at the end of this movie.  When you're always rooting for the guy, and to see someone make it to the top, and fall back down again is a little disappointing.  I wish he ended up in a moderate house on a suburb rather than the ghetto he ended up in.  But that's where he feels home in, most people say.",988070400,2,1571,3.9935897435897436

757543,4,6304007647,"Rocky: This story of a two-bit fighter who gets his ``million-to-one shot'' for fame, and self-respect, in a championship bout is impossible to dislike, even though it's just an old B-movie brought up to date. Knowing that the film was a similar do-or-die project for writer-star Stallone added to its good vibes. Oscar winner for Best Picture, Director, Editing (Richard Halsey, Scott Conrad). Followed by four sequels.
Rocky V: The one-time champ has hit rock bottom (again). He winds up in his old neighborhood, broke and ostracized (again). He trains a young boxer who turns ingrate, and in spite of his own brain damage (from the fight in ROCKY IV) is willing to risk everything on another bout. Again. You pays your money, and you gets what you expects in this Stallone screenplay, but seriously, folks, the thrill is gone. That's Stallone's real-life son in the role of Rocky, Jr.
Rocky II: Officially a sequel, this slightly silly film is more of a rehash, but the climactic bout (and buildup to it) hits home.
Rocky IV: Totally artificial (and unnecessary) sequel has Rocky doin' what a man's gotta do--avenging a friend's demise and fighting for the U. S. A. (and world peace) against a superhuman Russian champ. Still and all, Stallone knows how to milk a formula and press all the right buttons, especially in a great training montage.
Rocky III: T. Here, the Italian Stallion (Stallone) is trained by Apollo Creed (Weathers) after being dethroned by obnox ious Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Stallone's got a winning formula, but enough already.",986428800,2,1549,4.938697318007663
757544,5,6304007647,"Rocky 1 - In my opinion, as technically sound and gripping as any movie could ever be. It's the all-time favorite motion picture of mine and I don't think that's too unrealistic. After all, it did win the 1976 Best Picture. The special edition this set provides is great, but it is unfortunate that the other four did not get the same treatment, since all these movies are almost as good as their original.
Rocky 2 - A great finish, although a bit hokey, but it works every time. There are also some heart-wrenching scenes, but in the end, it's all worth it, because of the uplifting moments that they lead to. Up until part five, this was my personal favorite. Not as technically sound or believable as the first, but it really knows how to put your emotions through it.
Rocky 3 - Weak entry compared to the other four, but still worth the time. I say weak, but when talking about the Rocky movies, that's better than most quality motion pictures are today. Mr. T was a perfect villain for that time in American film history. Although part three is not as emotionally involving, it's still able to push the right buttons the way most films could only hope to.
Rocky 4 - Incredibly corny. Contrary to popular belief, this film is the only time in the entire series that Adrian ever utters the words, ""You can't win!"" The climactic bout is one of the most action-packed, goofy, and fun fights in the whole series, and it isn't nearly as lopsided as the six times Rocky gets knocked down would indicate. Excellent training montage, and an uplifting, totally satisfying conclusion.
Rocky 5 - This is the way Rocky should have gone out. If Rocky fans recall, Mr. Balboa found the boxing ring only after a troubled childhood where he got in a lot of STREET FIGHTS!!! Realistically speaking, if a man truly endured the punishment Rocky endured in part four, he'd be lucky to still be breathing, so the brain damage thing isn't farfetched. While Tommy Morrison was no actor (and didn't turn out to be much of a fighter for that matter), he worked in the context of the film. The crooked promoter is an absolute jackass. Although Sage Stallone didn't go on to enjoy much of an acting career, he was the perfect choice to play his real-life dad's on-screen son. The climax, regardless of what anyone thinks, was the perfect way to go out. After all, Rocky couldn't have realistically gotten a license to fight anywhere in the U.S. with the brain damage he sustained. Plus, it capped off the whole ""going back to his roots"" angle. Not to mention, it was the most emotionally satisfying fight in the series with an ending that still gives me chills every time I watch it the way no other film has. Let's face it, any attempt at putting Rocky back in the ring would have been impossible, stupid, unrealistic, and very Jean-Claude Van Damme-ish. Rocky instead got a classy send-off with a perfect ending. Perfect! Regardless of what any others think, it was perfect, perfect, perfect! And the song Elton John performs to accompany the closing credits is the best he's ever performed. In a word, this film is unbeatable.",985305600,20,3106,4.618444846292948
757605,5,6304007647,"Rocky I - Great movie.  This movie really shows where Rocky came from.  I think this movie was made in the mid 70's.  This movie would still be a hit today.  It shows how Rocky begins to find out his greatness and also how a love story will grow between him and Adrian.
Rocky II - In my opinion, the second best movie of the set.  Rocky gets the chance to avenge his first fight with Apollo Creed.  Definitely, this movie has one of the most inspiring workouts after a traumatic event in Rocky's life.  The intense, action-packed ending always makes me emotional. To see Rocky fulfill his promise to his wife is really special.
Rocky III - This movie is the only one that I fill did not live up to the hype.  It still has a great training sequence and an unbelievable fight.  (Clubber Lang trained harder, but still lost?)  That's ok.  Rocky still fights with himself on many issues and it shows when he hooks up with Apollo Creed.
Rocky IV - THE VERY BEST MOVIE.  Rocky has to avenge the his friend's unfortunate loss.  The series of events that unfold in the middle of the movie is very gripping.  There is a reason why TNT/TBS has this movie on seemingly once a month.  The training sequence is excellent.  The fight, although a little hard to believe when you compare Rocky's fight with Apollo's, is one of the longest and heart-wrenching fights he has.
Rocky V - Ok.  This movie saddened me.  Rocky could have come a little better for the last movie.  Rocky should have lost the title in a fight or something.  There are not too many champions who leave boxing on a winning note.  They usually retire and come back again.  Rocky's unfortunate life turns are a realistic alternative to losing a fight, but this movie lacks the big fight that it needed. Micky, his trainer, and Apollo, his nemisis and friend, were gone.  Yea, Rocky fought someone at the end- but it wasn't the same.  The training sequences that held up Rocky II, III and IV, was not here.  So, basically, the movie ended on a bad note.
I am a huge Rocky fan.  I think that the movies II, III, and IV were excellent.  Rocky I and V were a little weak in comparison, but still they had Stallone doing his bit.  This is an excellent set to have.  How many five movie sports movie sets do you know of that still are shown on network tv?",985132800,2,2303,4.352941176470588

Although people may find the IV and V Rocky's a little weak (obviously, it was impossible to live up to the other three's standards, the collection as a whole is spectacular.  Rocky combines drama, romance, action, and comedy in one package.  This collection is a must have for all boxing fans, Rocky fans, Stallone fans, people from Philly, or just plain old movie collectors.  This collection is nearly impossible to find in stores, so if you have been looking for it, now is the time to get it, before the legend is gone forever.  This movie is for everyone, you will not be disappointed.",983491200,8,662,4.6239316239316235

757610,5,6304007647,"People may well go on about how Raging Bull is the best boxing film ever made, and certainly it may be the most realistic, but for me John G Avildsen's Rocky will never be equalled.  The fight scenes in the original are just as realistic as Raging Bull (yes, really they are!), and it was only from Rocky II onwards that the boxing sequences became more over the top, with the punches sounding like Stallone's fist was an axe connecting with a tree.
Having said that, the sequels all have their strong points.  Story wise, the series always kept it's feet on the ground, apart from the comic-book style of Rocky IV, the only chapter to really feel out of place.  II comes close to matching the original, but as we know that Stallone has to win the rematch, it's not nearly as engrossing.  III is the best sequel, with superb direction from Stallone, and a strong script that sees Rocky settling for the easy life at the top before it comes crashing down around him.  IV as I said is the most over the top, but even this chapter works thanks to a great score, magnificent training sequences, and a superbly edited fight between Stallone and Dolph Lundgren.  V is the second best sequel, with Avildsen returning to the director's chair in an honourable attempt at recapturing the feel of the original.  Stallone's second best portrayal of the Rocky character, it remains the most under-rated of the series.
This DVD box-set should be a stunner.  We already know it looks great, and that the original Rocky is going to have many special features.  It's a shame though that it appears that the sequels will not have such extensive special features, meaning we probably won't get to see the cut scene from Rocky IV when Rocky is told by the boxing commission that they refuse to sanction the fight with Ivan Drago.  Still, it remains a box set that will be a must have.  Go for it!",981331200,9,1876,4.537091988130563
757611,5,6304007647,"Well...to start off with,all of the Rocky movies are great. I think that Rocky I really shows us that we can do anything that we want to...as long as we set our minds to it. Rocky II is like the heart of all of the Rocky movies. It shows Rocky become World Heavyweight Champion. Rocky III is not just a boxing movie. It is also a wrestling movie. The 'bout with Rocky and Hulk Hogan(named Thunderlips in the movie) was great. Rocky IV is really a sad movie...considering the death of ex-champion Apollo Creed. And has a great Hearts On Fire song. And it shows Rocky giving it his all in becoming fit. Rocky V...well is the worst of them all. I have nothing to say about that one.

All the films were great even Rocky VIII.Sylvester Stallone is  a great actor to play this person but what I don't agree with this movie is  that in Rocky IIII the russians took steroids trying to say that the  Americans were really good. When we all know that the Americans are renowned  to take steroids. This was the best film I have seen in my life the people  who act it are great and I am not surprised that Sylvester Stallone made it  in his career. This film gave me the effort to get fit and if you put your  mind to do anything you can be sure you will do it. It showed me what an  awful sport boxing is. I want to congratulate the cast. I also want to  congratulate Sylvester Stallone for creating this film and directing it  he's the best actor in the World! So you would mad to miss the film!,962236800,3,969,4.052631578947368

As an on-again, off-again fan of the series, and having been severely disappointed by the anticlimactic Rocky 4, I went into seeing part 5 hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I found myself (along with the rest of the audience in the theater that night) cheering the screen--something I, admittedly VERY difficult to please in the whole ""movie theater experience"", had not done in years. It's a pity to hear so many reviewers lump Rocky 5 into the same category as a Friday-The-13th rehash. Rocky 5 manages to recapture the emotion of the first movie and--believe it or not--has replaced the original Rocky as my favorite installment of the series. I thought it was that good, and I think it's great that they're all finally available on DVD. Now all I need is a DVD player...",961200000,,891,4.792207792207792
