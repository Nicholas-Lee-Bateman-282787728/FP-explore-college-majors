8587781,4,B00CZ79TDA,"Ayan Pratap wrote (with Jim Suthers providing the screenplay) and directed this quiet little film about following your passion. Though it is not a polished gem it carries a sensitivity that many young artists at the inception of their career and life in the arts will find poignant. There is an honesty about the film and the way it is presented that indicates that Ayan Pratap is a talent to watch. Before getting into the story it is important that the audience understands the concept of Kundalini - the subject of the mural whose endurance plays such a major role in the film. Kundalini stems from yogic philosophy as a form of shakti or ""corporeal energy"". Kundalini is described within Eastern religious, or spiritual tradition as an indwelling spiritual energy that can be awakened in order to purify the subtle system and ultimately to bestow the state of Yoga, or Divine Union upon the 'seeker' of truth "" The Yoga Upanishads describe Kundalini as lying ""coiled"" at the base of the spine, represented as either a goddess or sleeping serpent waiting to be awakened. In modern commentaries, Kundalini has been called an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force.

The plot is best summarized in the writer/director's words: `Unfulfilled in her work at the local diner, Alex Carlson (Aleece Jones, in a notable debut) feels like a tiger trapped in a cage. Her dream of leaving the town and pursuing an art career seems to be fading away. The only source of any artistic inspiration is an unfinished Kundalini mural painted on the side of a plastic bag factory by a local artist in 1970s. Alex's dream is further threatened by the impending closure of the plastic bag factory on which the mural is painted. A sliver of hope emerges when prodigal son Chuck Crowley (Christopher Ivins), the world famous photographer, returns to Cooper Flats. Chuck fascinates Alex and introduces her to Tratak meditation technique he learned in India. Alex must embrace what's to come next and choose whether to finish her journey she left half way or not, while the world around her starts to fall apart. When Chuck asks Alex what she intends to do after she leaves Cooper Flats, she is encouraged to follow her passion - a lesson from her empathy with the Kundalini image.

The cast may be uneven and the cinematography not always favoring the progress of the story telling, but Pratap has captured a moment in time so precious to those who commit to the arts - a decision whether to work for art or settle for less.

8587782,2,B00CZ79TDA,"I was contacted by the director and asked to provide an honest review in exchange for a DVD of the film. I was hesitant at first, but took a look at the trailer and was intrigued by the premise. Do a Google search for 'thenagainthefilm' and you'll have several options to view scenes and trailers.

This is the first effort by by Director Ayan Pratap. I tried to keep that in mind while watching it, as I'm not a film maker and I assume that's a creative endeavor that most of us could not undertake with much finesse. (I know I couldn't.)

 Noting 'The Indie Fest' Award Winner notation on the DVD cover, I assumed the film would be as good as the trailers suggested, but the actors would probably not be ones I would recognize. When the trailers were the best part, I decided to look up that award. I found theindiefest dot com online, and was less impressed with this award designation.  However, I can see where this film would win an award there.

Truly though, awards don't matter to me if I am engaged by a good story. I have watched films that won Oscars, that I didn't like for one reason or another. Unfortunately, what I found with Then Again was that it dragged flatly along, and never really captured me as a viewer. The acting was stilted and reminiscent of a high school play.  I didn't find myself feeling emotionally connected to any of the characters, despite a story which theoretically should have had me at the start.

I wanted this film to jump out and grab me, holding me tight until the emotional end when I would be released and set free with a higher understanding of self and spirit. What I got was a long trudge that barely held my attention.  Sorry Ayan... I really wanted to like it, but it was all I could do to finish it.",1407283200,,1753,4.355828220858895
8587783,2,B00CZ79TDA,"Well, we all have to start somewhere, right?

Then Again tries to tell the story of Alex Carlson, a young woman living in a small town, who takes care of her alcoholic father, works in a diner with a few other people, and has a boyfriend that looks and acts like he just hit 10th grade. She's into art, painting and sketching in her free time, and has a box of pamphlets from art colleges in her room. One day, Chuck Crowley, the son of one of her customers, comes to town. He's an international photographer, well-known from the photos that magazines publish. Having been all over the world, he's seen a lot, and has an open mind compared to the people Alex is used to talking to. After learning about a special meditation technique form Chuck, Alex has visions that she was another artist in a past life, in the same town, who was painting a huge mural that didn't get finished. Could this be her calling?

I wish I had kept track of how many times I sighed during this movie, because it had to've been over 100 through the very long, nearly two hour journey. There really isn't anything -good- I can say about Then Again, aside from Christopher Ivins, who played Chuck, doing a competent job. Aleece Jones, who played Alex, did alright as well, but neither one ever came off as giving believable performances. Even her alcoholic dad did little more than raise his voice during the ""dark"" scenes. I kept waiting for him to stomp his foot after making petty demands. Alex is in her late 20s, and is expected to pour coffee and cream for him when he's sitting right next to her at the dining room table? Good goggly moogly. Alex's boyfriend, Ben, had me rolling my eyes each time he'd overreact too. When Chuck first appears, the small handful of people at work (no more than 5) just go up and greet him with open arms. Mr. Ben gets jealous and wonders why everyone's making such a big deal. He throws a hissy fit and makes fun of the art show that Alex is interested in as well, then snickers when she talks about the possibility of being the reincarnation of the woman who was painting the mural. With Alex being a fairly decent woman, what did she see in this guy to get him more than a first date?

To make things worse, there isn't a real ""big"" problem until very late into the film. Most of the time is spent with Alex talking to Chuck, or dealing with her dad. This movie is supposed to be about Alex finding her passion in life, yet it seems pretty clear from the get-go that she knows that she doesn't want to be in that town any more; she just needs a way to get out. Annoying boyfriend could be dumped and taken care of. Alcoholic dad could get some sense slapped into him with an actual talk instead of complaints or sneaking around. On a side note- does anyone else find it weird that he's always shown in his coveralls for work, but they're always perfectly clean? Even towards the end, some construction workers clearly look like the dirt was applied strategically look like they've been doing more than him...and they just started their jobs for the day. Also, shout outs to the generic business woman who has one outfit as well.

I get that this is an independent movie and had a pretty small budget, but there was so much wrong, from editing, to lighting, to even the camera being in focus, that I thought this was a rough cut instead of a final version. I laughed out loud every time the camera would move along, then stop and go back to where it was supposed to stop. It happened several times early on, so much so that I was expecting to see a boom mic at any second. Some scenes would end with a character walking away, and neither them, or the character left in the background would be in focus. There was also one particular scene where two characters had a big argument, and as one of them was walking away, the reflection from a car's headlights in the back were bouncing off of something and overlapped the character right there in the middle of the shot until the car finally turned. This lasted for about 10 seconds. No one thought to go back and reshoot, or even better- make sure no cars came that way...or maybe just cut the scene down a little bit? And that's where another problem lies- you could cut out at least 30 minutes of this movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. Countless scenes end, but linger for a while as characters walk away or the soundtrack gets louder to try and put some emotion into it.

Surprisingly, there were some special features on the disc. The soundtrack is included, though you can only listen to it on the menu, and it's a little over 10 minutes. Some parts of the soundtrack were good, I'll admit, although nothing stood out. You also get the trailer and some deleted scenes. The fact that anything was deleted at all surprised me. They're all very short and none added anything to the plot. Go figure. No subtitles are available.

The reason I'm not giving Then Again one star is because I save that for things I absolutely hate, or were some of the worst movies I've ever seen. Then Again isn't god awful, it's just boring and essentially pointless. If Alex was more fleshed out, with more time spent on who she really is instead of on these other barely-two dimensional characters, it could have been at least average. Heck, I would've settled for more time spent on Indian religion and beliefs to add something interesting. Instead, it's only thrown in to be a small plot point and to show just how small-minded one character is.

If you have a dvd player that can run movies at 1.5 times normal speed, I highly recommend watching it like that. I'm serious.",1406937600,2,5625,4.428985507246376
