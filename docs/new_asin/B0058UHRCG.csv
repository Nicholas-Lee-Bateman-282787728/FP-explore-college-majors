4601642,5,B0058UHRCG,"I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is nice.  The scenery (pool and ocean beyond it) is beautiful.  The instructions are clear.  The ball really does make a difference.  The ball does deflate over time, which they warn you about, and you have to blow it back up, but it is quick and easy to do so. Definitely worth the money.",1328313600,5,333,4.238095238095238
4601643,5,B0058UHRCG,"I absolutely love this work out dvd! I am a beginner to pilates and her instruction is so easy to follow that I felt like I knew what I was doing within the first few times of using the dvd. Not only is it an amazing work out, it comes with a ball that she uses for EVERY move so you don't feel like the ball was a waste. I also love how she is using the exact same ball in the dvd.

Another great thing about it is it has 2 different sessions, a 20 minute and a 30 minute session. The first time I did it I was SHOCKED at how fast I went through the 20 minute so I went ahead and did the 30 minute as well!

The best part though, is that I started to see results after A WEEK of doing it! (granted, it wasn't a huge difference, but I could tell my body was changing) I also love that it's low impact so I don't get fatigued after doing it, but I can tell I've worked out. All in all, its easy to follow and will yield results.",1325462400,15,927,3.7487179487179487
4601644,5,B0058UHRCG,A very different product. The instructor is knowledgeable and is easy to follow. It is a great product and hope she will have many more in the near future!,1320019200,,155,4.379310344827586
4601645,5,B0058UHRCG,"Lisa has been a true inspiration for us Pilates devotees. Most of us know her from her close colaboration with Rael Isacowitz and thereby her appearence in the BASI Pilates books and DVDs. With her Rhythm Pilates approach she has started to leave her own foot prints in the Pilates world. With  the DVD Total Body Pilates with mini ball - Strengthen. streamline & redefine using the mini ball to sculpt a lean physique, she continues this path. This DVD features 2 workouts, one 20 minutes and one 30 minutes. Both are filmed in a beautifull garden beside a swimming-pool. Lisa shows the entire sequence as a continuous flow, while the cueing is done out of the off (also Lisa). By not having to talk while she practices Lisa shows how to do the movement sequences in a good flow with the right mind set. With this you get a feeling how one should practice when you have internalized the exercises and are able to do it without the DVD.
Lisa's verbal cueing during the exercises is first class and allows you to do the exercises even without looking at the TV (clearly you would need to have practiced before you can go to audio only).
The DVD comes in a box which includes a mini ball which you easily blow up with the included straw. The ball is pink (for me as a male maybe a bit funny) and very sturdy.
Lisa uses the mini ball throughout the entire workouts and mostly modifies Pilates mat exercises in a nice way. The ball offers a wider range of motion or an additional challenge for some of the classic exercises. All the ball modifications are done with purpose and a clear benefit in comparison to how you would do it without the ball.
During the workouts Lisa continuously offers modifications for the less advanced Pilates fans. But don't fool yourself: Even if you are advanced this DVD will challenge you and give you a new muscle ache. Well done, Lisa!",1319328000,17,1866,4.504424778761062
4601646,5,B0058UHRCG,"This is a great workout video for people who enjoy Pilates and yoga. At first the video does not seem difficult, but the further you get into it, the more you can feel the workout. . It's really helping me tone my saggy ""muffin-top"" waist area, while giving me the total stretching and strengthening I need. The visual demonstrations are very clear, and the detailed verbal instructions give me all the coaching I need to work on improving my Pilates technique.

Lisa Hubbard pairs strength training with flexibility work. She has you contract the muscles and then relieves the tension with a looooooooong stretch immediately afterwards. This is far superior to the neck-crunching Pilates workouts and the easier yoga workouts that don't seem to do enough strength work and it feels GREAT as you do it. The Pink ball has worked wonders on my back pain :)

It's a very mellow and relaxed workout that incorporates breath, well-paced and you still work up a sweat!
You feel great afterwards - looser, leaner, stronger, improved posture - that's enough incentive to do it a few times a week!
I enjoy it! I recommend this video to anyone who wants to start exercising and strengthen their core.",1319155200,22,1190,4.8
4601647,5,B0058UHRCG,"I really enjoyed this workout DVD.  I liked that the workouts are not overly long, but you still get a good workout.  I also like that the instructor gives you enough time to position the ball before the next move has begun so that it is easy to keep up.  I consider myself a high intermediate and found that this was challenging enough for me with some moves that I still can work up to.  As strange as it may sound, it is also a relaxing workout.  Don't get me wrong, you are still working out, but the instructor's voice and the setting is very calming and peaceful.  The ball is a very nice addition to the traditional pilates moves also, giving you what I consider more bang for your buck results and timewise. I highly recommend this workout.",1318896000,6,748,4.345323741007194
4601648,5,B0058UHRCG,"I am a very picky person when it comes to working out. I only like a few pilates instructors and I just stick with them. I discovered Lisa Hubbard however, watched a few clips, and decided I wanted to try this instructor + this workout. A very good decision by me because I love Lisa's instructional style and this workout.

One thing I love about element is that it takes you outside. You are working in a beautiful garden, and then out comes Lisa to explain what we're about to do. [this opening sequence is skippable if you do this workout a lot]. You have a choice between 20 minutes and a 30 minute practice - unfortuntatly, there is no 'play-all' practice.

The 20 minute practice has most of my favourite workouts, the hundred, the scissors, the helicoptor, and by incorporating the ball, you can actually get into a lot of deeper moves. I love it when mermaid is done as a workout, not a stretch and Lisa uses it here as well.

The 30 minute practice is a bit more challenging, including the rollover (something I mastered earlier this year), and more toning elements for the lower body, including clams and single leg pulses. The saw is also included.

The ball is not something just ""tossed"" in to market a gadget, Lisa expertly uses it to mimic the reformer and the barrel. I had to put it aside sometimes because I was personally uncomfortable (I am still slightly overweight, even losing a considerable amount of weight).

Lisa talks a lot, but not prattle, just constantly reminding you what you are working, how to adjust, how to breathe (CRITICAL in pilates practices!) and why you are working with the ball. It kept me focused, and reminded me of a live class.

It's not overly difficult, but not quite beginner, I'd put this in a solid intermediate with some challenging moves because of the ball, and I suggest you get it. (I got a light burn in some workouts but that's the beauty of pilates. it always smacks you not when you do it, but the next day).

(and the winner is, it's short enough to use as an accent to a walk/dance workout, or long enough to have a great lengthy one).",1318118400,59,2101,4.484293193717278

4601714,5,B0058UHRCG,"This DVD is led by Lisa Hubbard.  It offers two Pilates routines, one 20 minutes and one 30 minutes (different footage), both using the small inflatable mini ball that is included as part of the kit.  (If you happen to obtain the DVD separately, you can use any type of Pilates mini-ball or similar, such as this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-Back-Ball/dp/B00374O8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body Back Ball</a>.)  Hubbard instructs both routines via voiceover cuing.  She is teaching in the same outdoor set featured in the other Element workouts--a pretty garden overlooking the ocean in the background.

The Main Menu offers the option to choose either the 20 or the 30 minute routine; I have described each in detail below.

20 MINUTE TOTAL BODY PILATES
Hubbard begins this routine seated with the ball between the knees for partial rollbacks.  Moving the ball to between the shoulder blades, she performs chest lifts, adding in a twist, and a version of the single leg stretch.  She then switches the ball to between the feet for the hundred.  Following this, Hubbard completes a sequence with the ball placed under the sacrum:  exercises here include the scissors, helicopter, and bicycle.  After a brief mermaid/side stretch and a set of tricep push-ups (hands on the ball), Hubbard transitions to lying on her stomach for back extensions and butt lifts.  She concludes the workout with single leg Teaser 2 and a hip flexor stretch.

30 MINUTE TOTAL BODY PILATES
Hubbard starts this workout standing, transitioning to the floor with a hamstring stretch.  With the ball between the knees, she performs a modified rollback, hip raises, knee drops, and pendulum.  Moving the ball to under the shoulder blades, Hubbard moves through several modified series of five exercises.  She then returns the ball to between the knees/feet for rollover, corkscrew, and rolling like a ball.  Coming to a seated position, Hubbard performs the spine twist, spine stretch forward, saw, and open-legged rocker.  She then moves into a side series which includes oblique lifts, clam, and additional glute work with the ball behind one knee.  The final series is performed face-down with the ball placed under the sternum for breast stroke prep, moving into full breast stroke.  Hubbard concludes with push-ups and the same hamstring stretch from the beginning of the routine.

I really enjoyed both of these routines.  Hubbard uses the mini ball much more effectively than some of the other Pilates workouts I've tried; I found that the 30-minute routine incorporated the ball particularly well into the movements.

Hubbard teaches both workouts on this DVD in a steady flow.  I have been doing Pilates for years and am at an intermediate level; I found the pace ideal, but it would probably be too fast for beginners who are unfamiliar with the exercises.  Therefore, I would recommend this DVD for advanced beginners/low intermediates and beyond.",1335657600,8,2989,5.281779661016949
4601715,2,B0058UHRCG,"I bought a whole set of Element dvds and I have to say that this is one that I like least, so far.

First of all, the ball is utterly useless. The straws broke before I even got them out of the package and I ended up using the air compressor to blow it up.

When it comes to actually using it, it put my body at such an awkward angle in so many of the poses that I gave up not even halfway through the dvd and just did the poses (or modified them) without the ball. To me, if I have to do something completely different for an entire video, then it's one I'm going to sell back.

If you are looking for workout assistance, there are other videos out there that use two small balls for yoga and pilates moves and I think they're much more useful. Also, the straps, bungie cords, or yoga blocks work much better for some of these poses.

However, it's a decent workout for a beginner-intermediate. I wouldn't try it if you're an absolute beginner and I think it helps to have done other videos or classes first for a lot of the poses b/c she doesn't really explain them well enough to not end up hurting yourself, esp. with the angle of the ball.",1333065600,9,1144,4.116591928251121
4601716,4,B0058UHRCG,"I like this DVD.  The ball adds an extra ""oomph"" to the workout.  My only complaint is that she goes so fast...  now once I'm familiar with the workout it won't matter, but while I'm still learning it it's hard to keep up with her and do my form right.  However, the workout is terrific and I definitely feel it the next couple days.",1332288000,8,333,4.15625
4601717,5,B0058UHRCG,"I bought this because I would like to visualize myself physically fit on a beach
while exercising. The video does have the ocean and the girl, but instead of lying
on the sandy beach, she is on the grass slightly above the ocean. I like the way
the moves strengthen my body so that I can do more-advanced yoga. I am pleased
with the grace of the girl as she leads me. She is easy to follow, and the exercises
are medium in difficulty so that I can do them all.",1330300800,3,460,4.065934065934066

I FEEL better and LOOK better, and frankly, I AM better!

8462285,5,B0058UHRCG,"This DVD helped me when physical therapy couldn't get me relief from arthritis that had taken hold of my chest after breaking a lot of ribs and damaging intercostal muscles. I felt relief in under 15 usages and this was after 6 months of consistent physical therapy. I was hurting so much I'd pretty much given up on my rigorous high impact exercising as it was so difficult to breathe and I was making too many compensations that could have resulted in bad form and more injury. This DVD enabled me to eventually return to my more rigorous exercising but I've kept this in the rotation for the sake of keeping my arthritis away and also getting a great core stretch and toning session when I don't feel like getting in a disgusting sweat drenching hard workout. You don't have to workout hard to get a healthy toned body. If you have any physical injury and don't want to do crazy workouts anymore--give this DVD a go.

Update June 2018: Still one of my go to DVDs for arthritis pain and realigning my posture. I have switched the pink ball that comes with the DVD with a yellow theraband inflatable mini ball I purchased from Amazon and I find I prefer this new ball. It has held up well to excessive use. I have found this DVD to be so very wonderful for eliminating pain. I have truly saved a heck of a lot of money by using it because it has reduced my need for PT and chiropractor visits which was a frequent expense in my life because as a violinist, the extreme asymmetrical posture and movement can cause pretty intense wear and muscular imbalances and this routine works deep on your stabilizer muscles to train them properly and break wrongly formed muscle memory. I even used this disc to supplement PT post my second shoulder surgery on my bow arm (I did have to modify or leave out a few moves though) and it truly helped accelerate healing and strength. I was back to playing violin in 4 months rather than the anticipated year. Thank you, Element DVD team and Lisa Hubbard! I have bought more Element DVDs as a result of this mini ball routine and I feel Element presents a superior product. The mini ball routine is my favorite though. So thankful for it. Please give it a try.",1469404800,5,2194,4.444168734491315
8462286,5,B0058UHRCG,"Excellent pilates DVD.  I am not new to pilates workouts, but I would not quite consider myself a seasoned veteran.  I am still sort of new at it.  I have only ever done the pilates workout DVDs by Denise Austin.  While they were effective, I wanted something a little more challenging.  What drew me to this DVD specifically was the incorporation of the mini ball.  I thought that might add a refreshing and challenging twist.  Boy, was I right!  Ms. Hubbard actually incorporates the ball into the workout, bringing a new twist on traditional pilates moves.

My only critique is that I wish the ball was a little biggger.  The ball used on the DVD is bigger than the one you actually get -- you get the mini size and Ms. Hubbard has the small size.  Still, the workout is effective with the mini ball.

I would highly recommend this DVD to beginners and those, like me, that can't afford to be part of a pilates gym, but want the workout.",1456099200,6,940,4.432748538011696

I will not be returning the dvd but I will throw away the ball.
Why on earth would I be trying to get in better shape only to take the chance of using a toxic ball????
The manufacturer should warn consumers by stating this fact on the box or including it in the Amazon description. Or better yet...include a non-toxic ball!!!!",1454025600,6,561,4.6767676767676765
