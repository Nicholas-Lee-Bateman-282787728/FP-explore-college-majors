3741555,1,B001P80ZY2,"The premise is inane, the plot contrived, and the dialogue stilted.  The actors were likeable enough to keep me from hating the film...and that is the only good thing I can say about it.",1388620800,,186,4.470588235294118
3741556,3,B001P80ZY2,This is a nice little movie to while away some time and watch with a friend on a rainy fall day in 2013,1383091200,,103,3.5217391304347827
3741557,4,B001P80ZY2,"Story was good, but quality of video and audio no very good.  Need to listen carefully as plot moves quickly.",1373846400,,109,4.45
3741558,4,B001P80ZY2,Family looking out for family and sometimes taking the hit for the team. It was a very colorful movie for a black and white....too much a fun.,1371686400,,142,4.296296296296297
3741559,5,B001P80ZY2,"Love these old movies... they have good story lines.
These kids really made this movie, too. Very innocent and naive but bold and daring, too.",1368489600,,142,4.72
3741560,3,B001P80ZY2,I watched this on my Kindle Fire so the quality was just okay.  The movie was funny but the storyline just okay.  I would still watch again as I find the older movies leave more to the imagination and are actually more entertaining to watch.,1368403200,,241,4.333333333333333
3741561,4,B001P80ZY2,Enjoyed watching this.  I enjoy old movies and this is very convenient to watch at home on my computer.  Thanks,1365552000,,111,4.5
3741562,2,B001P80ZY2,"I like old movies, but I couldn't follow this one that much.  Very old but I just couldn't watch it all the way thru.  I got it because Joseph Schildkraut was in it.  He was in Marie Antionette and he was outstanding in that picture.  But I just couldn't get into this one.  Plot is not great.  Thank you.",1361318400,,305,4.084745762711864
3741563,5,B001P80ZY2,"What a sweet, cute romance; one of those good old 'afternoon classic' movies :) One to sit down after the vacuuming and dishes are done, put your feet up and enjoy some beverage and this movie :) Also just before bed. Nothing strenuous, cute plot with a few twists for fun. Decently shown and you'll smile. (I think, if I am reading it correctly, the ""amazon"" description is a bit 'off/backwards' or something. Seems the annulment thing is mixed up there in the info.)And the folks in the movie - well, all they really had to do was annul the right one from the right one! Gives a good 'run-around' laugh!) And I'll let you figure that one out while watching this really cute, sweet movie with decent characters and some fun! Make sure you catch the wink in the end!",1348012800,2,766,4.439716312056738
3741564,4,B001P80ZY2,"The performances are excellent, and the premise, although unoriginal, is well played out. The problem, if any, is that the movie is a little short, hence the subpar character development. The streaming version here on Amazon contains a few short lacunae: bits and pieces of missing film, usually less than a second or so in duration, and only a few. It's just an old film, you know, that has not been preserved properly. But the audio is quite good, if a bit scratchy at times: again, not often and not too detracting from the entertainment. If you like these old B&W romcoms, and have a spare hour, then enjoy!",1318464000,7,611,4.614678899082569
3741585,3,B001P80ZY2,"Commissioner Gordon, you guys!  Watching this movie, I realize the male lead sounds familiar.  Well, it is if you watched Batman in the 1960's.  Cute little quickie film with an original plot.",1444953600,2,192,4.9375
3741586,4,B001P80ZY2,Enjoyable as an old movie would be.,1444176000,,35,4.142857142857143

3741588,3,B001P80ZY2,"Cute, a pleasant diversion. No surprises. It is a bit dated. I just watched it to see a much younger Neil Hamilton. From the Batman TV series.",1442102400,,142,4.296296296296297
3741589,5,B001P80ZY2,Very Funny.,1431043200,,11,5.0
3741590,3,B001P80ZY2,"It is fun to watch movies from this era.  How people relate to one another, how stories resolve, etc.  but maybe not representative of anything, as it wasn't a popular movie, as far as I can tell.  Good for passing the time.",1428278400,,224,4.285714285714286
3741591,4,B001P80ZY2,Good wholesome old movie. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.,1427328000,,53,3.5
3741592,2,B001P80ZY2,I gave it a shot but the acting was just painfully awkward- as was the script which just wasn't making sense with regard to character motivations. Their choices just didn't make sense. I got about half way through it. I might return to see if I can finish it- to see if it gets any better but it was pretty painful to sit through what I watched.,1426636800,,345,4.164179104477612
3741593,4,B001P80ZY2,"A classic romantic comedy from a bygone era.  While the story line may be hard to relate to now, it was entertaining and sweet.",1425168000,,127,4.291666666666667
3741594,4,B001P80ZY2,It was a cute little movie.,1414627200,,27,3.6666666666666665
3741595,3,B001P80ZY2,"Love these old movies. However, I struggled to hear what they were saying as sound quality was off. Still a cute old movie.",1408233600,,123,4.391304347826087
3741596,3,B001P80ZY2,"This is really an oldie, and I wasn't sure that I'd like it, but I really did enjoy it!  Done without profanity and the usual offensive content of many of the films today.  It was fun to watch!",1408147200,,193,4.052631578947368
3741597,5,B001P80ZY2,"Lady Behave,  They fall in love couples. had hard time at first get there later it happen. both couple's. there. was romance plus. a little of action and drama. for them!!",1407110400,,171,4.516129032258065
3741598,3,B001P80ZY2,"It's really hard to figure out some of the movie because of the poor sound. The acting is average & the movie just so-so. The Father, who is the love interest is rather on the old side, old enough to be a bit on the creepy side. They are trying to get you to see a romance between a young educated, serious woman and a dead beat dad who's a boozing womanizer....not romantic.",1405296000,,375,4.1506849315068495
3741599,5,B001P80ZY2,This movie was silly and you knew what was going to happy from the beginning but it still made me laugh and smile.,1399248000,,114,4.0
3741600,5,B001P80ZY2,Had a wonderful time viewing this look at comedy in a past time.  What a fun show. Would recommend it to those who enjoy simple  fun; humor that transcends time.,1399161600,,161,4.333333333333333
3741601,3,B001P80ZY2,"typical mindless 30's comedy
no real acting skills needed!
i loved the stereotypes and lack of logic
watch when you don't want to think too much",1398470400,,144,4.576923076923077
3741602,4,B001P80ZY2,"This has a formula plot but it is fun to watch.  The premise is just like old novels of that time,  and the acting is -- well, it is acting in the 1930s.  All in all, it was a fun hour.",1393718400,,185,3.4634146341463414
3741603,2,B001P80ZY2,"The juveniles were left by the director to their own devices and, since so much depends on their supporting the premise of the story, an already uninspired story falls flat.  Ms Eilers earns her well deserved dramatic eclipse since I'm not aware of anything she was contracted for after this.  Okay, it makes no pretensions of being Jane Eyre.. but still...",1391904000,,357,4.836065573770492
3741604,3,B001P80ZY2,An early attempt at a screwball comedy.  The plot is thin but the actors did a good job with what they had to work with. The directing and cinematography seem pretty good for the 1930's. I especially liked the two teenaged children of the rich playboy character.,1389225600,,262,4.574468085106383
8332448,5,B001P80ZY2,"Such a fun movie. Hard to believe it's eighty years old as it could easily have been recently done. Nothing overdone, just a good movie.",1515974400,,136,4.48

8332450,4,B001P80ZY2,"A sweet comedy about two sisters. The older sister, Paula, lives a quiet life, managing the financial affairs for both sisters along with her godfather Burton. The younger sister, Clarice, is a party girl.  She accidentally marries Mr. Cormac during a night of revelry, while both were drunk, forgetting that she is already married to Mr. Andrews, from whom she is separated but not divorced. It is up to Paula and Burton to get Clarice out of trouble for bigamy.  Burton's idea is that Paula pretend to be Clarice, that is Mrs. Cormac while Burton works on getting Clarice's marriage to Andrews. The plan does not work out well. Mr. Andrews has other plans (he is a con artist who spent all of Clarice's money after marrying her) and now has his sights on conning money out of the Cormacs and Paula.",1493078400,,800,4.626760563380282
8332451,5,B001P80ZY2,"Very funny screwball comedy typical for that era -keep in mind its release date is 1937- with a fine cast portraying their characters as quite serious in all they do, essential for this sort of humor. An overlooked gem with a shorter run time than many of those featuring well known stars but just as professionally great.  Pull up a chair, grab that bowl of popcorn, and laugh aloud at the antics.",1484697600,,398,4.527777777777778

8332455,1,B001P80ZY2,"I love this movie. I saw it on YouTube and thought it was great. It is from the 1930's so the acting and script is on that level, but plot and execution was adorable. However do NOT get this DVD. The description claims a 70 min. running time, I was excited about this since the YouTube version only has a 53 min. running time and obviously has parts missing, but it only runs 53 min.and parts are still missing. The sound and lighting blacked out in parts, the mode was inconsistent; changing between light, dark, sharp, and blurring. It also wasn't formatted to fit your TV and the image was cropped throughout.
I am still looking for the full version of this movie, but until I find one, I have returned this DVD and watch it on YouTube.",1461542400,2,739,4.36231884057971
