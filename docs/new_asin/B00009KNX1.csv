7990950,3,B00009KNX1,"After viewing several of Sullivan Entertainment's series and movies, my family and I found this movie was definitely a departure from what we have viewed previously. We have enjoyed all other series and DVD's a lot, but this was not one of them. This is not in keeping with majority of Sullivan's Entertainement and is definitely adult only. It should be rated for adults only due to sexual content and the script. I gave it three stars only because it is does hold your interest due to being a mystery, but I would never watch it again.",1500163200,,537,4.546391752577319
