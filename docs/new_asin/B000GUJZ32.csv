8134691,1,B000GUJZ32,"These dvd's are a huge disappointment.  My 20 month old son loves all things construction...hand tools, power tools, tractors and trucks and construction machines.  I was hoping these would build on his interest and help him begin to follow simple story lines and understand plot.

The episodes jump around from scene to scene...nurturing a short attention span.  The machine characters do not have moving mouths...so I doubt a young child can even follow the dialogue...who's talking?  The female characters are stereotypical...they should to pick up a hammer along with Bob.

I'm hoping to find some decent Bob the Builder books, although, I do hate to give my son content with machines that talk....complete nonsense for the child under 3, working to make sense of the real world.

Anyone have any book recommendations for a near 2 year old who wants to bang a hammer along side his father and learn about all things construction?",1255737600,2,933,5.01948051948052
8134692,5,B000GUJZ32,"Though I might not necessary like Bob the Builder, my 2.5 son loves watching the series. I have to admit, some of the characters on this show definitely have their issues, but I think what is great about this series is that there are a lot of lessons to be learned. A lot of coping skills that are emphasized in this series.  Good buy for fans.",1252713600,,344,4.212121212121212
8134693,3,B000GUJZ32,I'm sure this will get five star from a Bob the builder fan but my son is not so much in it.  He likes watching thomas videos.  He doesn't really understand all the conversations.  It is not clearly said or they talk to fast for him.  My son is four and loves the Thomas collection better.,1248134400,,289,4.107142857142857

8134695,3,B000GUJZ32,"My 2-going-on-3-year-old hardly watches any TV/videos, but his grandmother sent him this set, which immediately made a Bob fan out of him.  Two of the DVDs have appropriately short, calm, accessible episodes.  They include hair salons, dry cleaners, dates and fashion shows, which don't contribute to the accessibility, but that doesn't prevent their target audience from enjoying them.  The ""Snowed Under"" DVD, however, is completely different, and not at all suited to pre-school children.  My son loved it, of course, since it was long-- perhaps 50 minutes-- and involved snow, but after a few viewings, I had to ""lose"" it because I couldn't stand to have him watch it anymore.  Scoop is a complete jerk throughout, then blames everybody else for treating him badly until he has no choice but to realize how stupid he has been.  That's basically the plot.  It's full of conflict and anger, accusations and name-calling.  If you go for this set, preview that one to decide for yourself if you want your children to act out Scoop's bad behavior.",1242172800,9,1046,4.971264367816092
8134696,5,B000GUJZ32,My 2 yr. old granddaughter loves the Bob the Builder DVD - Hard at Work.,1235779200,,72,3.8666666666666667
8134697,3,B000GUJZ32,"The dvd collection arrived in new condition and there were no problems with the order.  Unfortunately after viewing the DVD's, my 2 year old is no longer interested in BOB.  He loves the Bob toy tool belt and other Bob toys, but the DVD's were not age appropriate. After we watched the DVD's I found myself yawning as well.  My opinion about this collection is that there is not enough building is going on, no songs and story lines that are more age appropriate for 5 and up. Before you buy this collection, make sure your child is crazy for Bob or your wasting your money.",1231632000,,574,4.39622641509434
