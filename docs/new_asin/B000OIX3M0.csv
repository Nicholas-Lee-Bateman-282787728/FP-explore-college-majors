8185468,4,B000OIX3M0,"This is a very good episode from the Nature series.  It shows the strange and unusual wildlife found in Patagonia, a region at the southern tip of South America. There are wild camels, rheas (a bird like the ostrich), penguins, whales, seals and many other animals living in their unique landscapes and habitat.  It's well worth getting-- even if only on VHS.  Perhaps someday it will be released on DVD.",1210982400,,404,4.742857142857143
