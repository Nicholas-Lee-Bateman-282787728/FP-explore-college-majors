Maria) resolve their little quarrel, it shows the traditional way that Filipinos celebrate the New Year.  Brings back memories of my childhood when Jeff and Lino were using the bamboo cannon instead of fireworks.",1372032000,,316,4.943396226415095
5717225,5,B00CDZO9O8,"The selection in this volume is a turning point in Ser Chief (Richard Yap) and Maya's (Jodi Sta. Maria)relationship.  For those who have been following the series ahead of the video release, Ser Chief would refer to the incident at the summit as the point when he knew he was in love with Maya.  Also, as a caution to buyers, wipe down the DVD before playing it.  Seems like there was some residue from the manufacturer that made it skip.  This simple step would help your viewing.",1372032000,,481,4.494252873563219
5717226,5,B00CDZO9O8,"For those who are following this TV series from the Philippines, it just keeps getting better.  A lot of people from the Philippines can relate to this series.  With our hopes and dreams of traveling to other countries and having a successful career, these are the same as the dreams of a provincial lass from Mindoro.  But how will Maya de la Rosa (Jodi Sta. Maria) decide on what is more important in her life.  Now that she knows that her former employer Richard Lim (Richard Yap) and owner of Lim Aviation Services has professed his love for her.

Buy the series and you will have a classic ""Teleserye"" (TV Series from the Philippines that you will treasure and makes a wonderful Mother's Day gift.  Thank you Amazon and to the vendor.",1368144000,,739,4.5606060606060606
5717227,5,B00CDZO9O8,"This is a TV series from the Philippines that you should not miss.  The actors in this show are one a tour in Canada (Edmonton and Toronto) and the U.S. (Kissimee and L.A.) this May 2013 and the tickets are already sold out.  You would not go wrong since the show was made for the whole family to enjoy the adventures of Maya (Jodi SantaMaria) as she chases her dream of becoming a Flight Attendant.  With the help of a kind hearted widower she names ""Ser Chief"" (Richard Yap), she is able to achieve her dreams but with a catch.  Cupid steps in.  I don't want to ruin the series for those who are buying this series and watching it for the first time.

I am very happy that this TV series is available on Amazon.com.  We missed a lot of episodes with work and life activities.  But we also want to keep this series for all the fun we had watching it.  Thank you.",1366243200,4,863,4.181818181818182
