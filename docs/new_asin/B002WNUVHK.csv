4007585,3,B002WNUVHK,"I was slightly disappointed watching this.  I saw part of Lavelle Crawford's segment online and bought the DVD.  He was by far the best of the group.  He still tells a lot of ""fat"" jokes, but he was funny nonetheless.  Arnez J. should retire, he was the pits.  I got a few laughs from Earthquake.  DL Hughley was a good host.",1291766400,,325,4.245901639344262
4007586,5,B002WNUVHK,This was one of the funniest comedy Dvd i have seen. This will definiately have you laughing for a while.,1291161600,,105,4.3
4007587,5,B002WNUVHK,This dvd is sooooooooooooooooo funny. You must get this if you consider yourself a true comedy fan. The guys rocked this dvd.,1284768000,,125,4.7272727272727275
4007588,3,B002WNUVHK,"Which isn't saying much because I rated it a 3.  DL was funny and Lavell Crawford was funny.  Everyone else was just blah. I was disappointed by Arnez J.  He's usually very funny, but this routine was weak.  He tells these stories that aren't funny at all, and then he told that same recycled joke about his brother Rodney. He needs some new material. Interestingly enough, I've never considered DL funny but he was really funny on this.  The female told some funny jokes but her delivery was wack.  It was like she was reading a que card or something.  I watched about 3 minutes of Earthquake, got sick of hearing the ""f"" and ""b"" words so i skipped through the rest of his, so I don't know how funny he was. Lavelle was the star of this one!  He was soooooooo funny.  His joke about McDonalds salads was hilarious.

I liked the other one better than this.  Rent before you buy.",1281139200,7,878,4.3580246913580245
4007589,4,B002WNUVHK,Overall it is great it just has some parts that are a little slow.  But you won't feel like you wasted your money.  In fact I am getting ready to watch it now.,1274400000,,159,3.787878787878788

4007591,4,B002WNUVHK,"No AS funny as I'd hoped, but DL Hughley was hilarious as always, Arnez J started off slow in my opinion, but was very funny. And Earthquake was funny as always. The Phoenix, Arizona All Star Comedy Jam with Cedric, Tommy Davidson, Aries Spears, DeRay and Kevin Hart was much funnier in my opinion.",1272672000,,298,4.537037037037037
4007592,5,B002WNUVHK,I'd usually prefer to rent comedy specials but after seeing this on Showtime I was convinced that this is a must have stand-up DVD!! D.L. doesn't disappoint as host! Arnez J and Melanie Comarcho do a decent job but Earthquake and Lavell absolutely murder the stage!! I've watched this 3 times since purchasing! It doesn't get old and it's a great DVD to throw on whenever you have some company!,1266796800,5,394,4.642857142857143

 I mean Come on Shaq this isn't even second string players, this is an embarrassment to call it fail.
 I couldn't tell if Arnez J was trying to be a gay Mike Epps or, a straght Paul Mooney.
I couldn't watch this train wreck all the way through....I thought D.L. was going to choke a bitch, why not edit that s*** out? nobody want to see Hughley get into a pissing contest with some bass heads from 1989. I'll finish up with the big dude straight looked like a thumb......talked like he had half a pork loin lodged in his thorax....for real was it just me or did everyone seem kinda pissed off over some slight s***?",1392854400,,801,4.298013245033113
