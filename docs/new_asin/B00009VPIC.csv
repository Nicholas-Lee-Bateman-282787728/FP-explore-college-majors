The plot in this one is about two men who steal chickens from a farm and create chaos in the town. There's bad acting and lighting. It tries very hard to be funny but isn't.

The good thing about this is the stars. There's Del Reeves and Mel Tillis plus the smooth voices of forgotten Margie Bowes and David Houston. The best part of the movie for me was when he sang Almost Persuaded.

I give it 1 for the movie and an extra star for the music. (My sister who watched it with me says I'm being too kind by doing that.) If you want to try the genre watch Road to Nashville which is masterful compared to this. Actually even the ridiculed Hillbillys in a Haunted House is better than this. If you do get this be wise and fast forward to the performances which I should have done.",1100131200,3,1017,4.178571428571429
