5933894,1,B00EQ2KVHU,Often movie collections do not offer closed captions for the hard of hearing. Do these? It's not listed.,1410566400,,104,4.833333333333333
5933895,5,B00EQ2KVHU,"In my opinion this is a great collection of older movies, some of which are hard to find. For example, Deceived, with Goldie Hawn, is a fairly rare movie as a stand alone. Not only that, it is expensive. For me, Color of Night is worth the admission by itself. Bruce Willis and Jane March create magic in every scene in which they appear.. Worth mentioning is D.O.A., with Dennis Quaid and future wife Meg Ryan. I watch this movie every couple of years. The Rich Man's Wife is very suspenseful and displays the superior talents of Halle Berry in one of her best performances before Swordfish. Buy this very reasonably priced collection. It is truly worth the price.",1407196800,20,665,4.5966386554621845

5933902,4,B00EQ2KVHU,"In any budget collection like this, I am pretty happy if I like half the movies. It takes me awhile to get through 8 movies, so I'm reviewing at the 4-movie mark. Consenting Adults and Color of Night were both entertaining, well-executed flicks. Suspenseful, compelling, time well spent. The Rich Man's Wife and Playing God were both so-so IMO. All have brand-name actors, and ymmv.",1452556800,4,382,4.892307692307693
5933903,4,B00EQ2KVHU,"This is a terrific box set. It would cost you more to buy ONE of any of these movies individually than it costs to get them in this nice little pack. The prints are excellent, and The Color of Night is even presented in its extended (139 minutes) version! Only demerit: no subtitles.",1446940800,7,283,4.3584905660377355

5933910,5,B00EQ2KVHU,"I have seen only a few movies in this collection. Color of Night is a very good movie. A twist that has to be seen to be believed. A group of misfits trying to find reason behind their unique problems and a woman who cruelly plays out their fantasies, while struggling to find her own reality. D.O.A.is suspenseful and Quaid s good. Dead on Arrival is about a man who is dying/murdered and is racing against time to find the person responsible for his upcoming death. Deceived helps prove Goldie Hawn can do something else besides smile. She is dramatic and talented. I have a feeling that the other movies in this collection will be just a good.",1437350400,12,646,4.483050847457627

8608288,5,B00EQ2KVHU,"Some of these are very rare.  ""The Tie That Binds"" with Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine is priceless and very violent.  That is probable why you have never heard of it.  Would have gotten a ""Strong R"" or ""X"" rating at the time it was made.  The acting is really good, and the story line keeps you guessing.  Worth the price of the collection for this title alone!",1494892800,3,364,4.294117647058823
