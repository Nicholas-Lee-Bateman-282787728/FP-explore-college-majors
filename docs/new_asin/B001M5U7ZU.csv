3692691,4,B001M5U7ZU,"When Fox commissioned a new series of Futurama episodes after Futurama's initial cancellation, it was decided that four feature-length episodes would be produced, and this is the result.  In general, the plots are slower to develop and more sweeping in scope than the plot of a typical Futurama episode.

In Bender's Big Score, nudist alien scammers use a time code tattooed on Fry's buttocks to go back in time, steal all of Earth's treasures from the past and rule the world.  Meanwhile, Leela meets the man of her dreams, and a frustrated Fry wonders if his life would have been better off back in the 21st century.

In The Beast With A Billion Backs, a tentacled, amorous monster from another realm invades the universe and promises the lovelorn, heartbroken citizens of the universe (including our heroes at Planet Express) a life in paradise.

In Bender's Game, the Planet Express crew seek to uncover the mysteries behind the ruthless Mom's dark matter mine, but Bender's overactive imagination catapults everyone into an alternate D&D-themed medieval universe.

In Into The Wild Green Yonder, Leela becomes an eco-terrorist outlaw when she seeks to save a small planet from being destroyed by Leo Wong's entertainment empire.  Our heroes end up pitted against each other when Fry lears that the planet is a key element in a cosmic struggle for the fate of all biological life in the universe.

It is clear that the Futurama crew conceived of these movies as epic adventures instead of merely extended-length episodes.  The animation and score are certainly up to snuff; scenes from the Futurama universe(s) are rendered in stunning detail, and the music enhances the mood of the movies throughout.

As mentioned above, the plots are slower to develop than in a 22-minute episode.  On one hand, the storylines are intriguing, infused with Futurama's brand of subtle satire and develop the main characters in clever ways.  On the other hand, the moods throughout the movies undergo slow, seismic shifts, and as a result viewers who are accustomed to Futurama's typical joke-a-second pace may find portions of each movie tense or tedious.

Overall, the movies have a different flavor from the episodes of the original series, and they don't quite reach the heights of Futurama's finest episodes, but they're all entertaining in their own ways.  Devoted Futurama fans especially should consider the set of movies a mandatory purchase; Futurama's return to the airwaves could very well be contingent upon the sales of the movies, and the movies show that the series still has quite a bit to offer.",1240012800,20,2600,5.044392523364486
3692692,4,B001M5U7ZU,"I've loved FUTURAMA since it first came out on TV.  These ""movie-length"" versions take some getting used to.  At first I didn't like them all that much.  But on second (and third, and fourth...) viewing, I am liking them a LOT more.  These episodes are pretty ""thick.""  Story lines aren't resolved in 23 minutes like in the old days.  Stick with it though: persistence pays off.  Considered as a whole, these movies are GOOD moving towards GEAT.",1240012800,2,445,4.701298701298701
3692693,4,B001M5U7ZU,"Didn't like as much as tv series, but the Futurama we know and love.  This series really needs go back to 30 minutes, I found the movies to be a bit lengthy and drawn out.  I didn't find the stories very good but still had the great characters and antics of Futurama.

Please buy to show your support so they can get this back on tv.",1239840000,,333,4.015151515151516

I'm not giving spoilers. oh I don't like bender much. Leela Leela Leela !,1438905600,,298,4.4363636363636365
8320540,5,B001M5U7ZU,Too bad it was cancelled again. The finale almost gave me tears. I have collected all episodes and will watch them again some years later...,1390953600,,140,4.64
8320541,5,B001M5U7ZU,"All four of the Futurama full-length movies for a reduced price.  How can you NOT love that!

The movies themselves are a bit slow to get going in action and laughs, but the plots are more sweeping and the payoff at the end better than a regular episode.  ""Into the Wild Blue Yonder"" is really required for series continuity, as it feeds directly into the first season five episode, ""Rebirth,"" but all of the other movies add to the genre as well.

If you're a D&D or Tolkien geek (like me) ""Bender's Game"" is a real treat to watch.  ""The Beast with a Billion Backs"" is pretty funny, but ""Bender's Big Score"" is awesome!  It really ties nearly EVERYTHING in the Futurama universe together in one film, and I think really sets Leela and Fry up as a couple.  (I won't spoil how or why.)

The extras on the DVD's are pretty good; nothing earth shaking though.

I've seen complaints about the cardboard packaging on here, but that's standard for even the seasonal releases.  The DVDs I received had no scratches or defects on them, and since I transfer all of my DVDs into large multi-DVD holders, storage in the flimsier cardboard container is not an issue.

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this set for the avid Futurama fan.  If you're not a huge fan of the show, you might actually like these movies more, as the way they're put together is different from the series, and they tend to be more long-term engaging.",1350691200,,1408,4.521739130434782
8320542,5,B001M5U7ZU,"I love all 4 of these movies! I had watched them already before hand... and well I decided I needed to own them cause they are really funny!

If you loved the Show you will like the movies :)

As for seller side, the movie cases and Discs were in great shape and was shipped very nice, thank ya!",1297123200,,295,3.983050847457627
8320543,5,B001M5U7ZU,Futurama is one of my favorite animated series of all time. After being canceled from television the creators have made four full length feature films. All four of them are as hilarious as the tv series. I love it!,1268438400,,214,4.512820512820513
8320544,5,B001M5U7ZU,"I am a long-time Futurama fan. Although these movies aren't the same as the old episodes, they are still great. They are definitely worth watching. I look forward to the return of the tv series!",1255219200,,194,4.571428571428571
8320545,2,B001M5U7ZU,"Not necessarily reviewing the content of the DVDs - just the packaging.  The boxes were all damaged slightly and as people have complained about other Matt Groening packaging - it's BAD.  The DVDs aren't really in anything to protect them from scratching, just cardboard.  I understand that this is better for the environment, but maybe Matt should invent some sort of packaging that is both environmentally friendly AND protects the DVDs!!",1254096000,6,440,5.169014084507042
8320546,3,B001M5U7ZU,"Purchased anyway since lazy and don't expect the price to drop but basically payed $70 for a season, the price went even higher a couple hours later to over 100. Not even the HBO season box sets reach that high",1240963200,,210,4.275
8320547,4,B001M5U7ZU,"Just a warning to those who make the assumption that the ""Futurama Movies Collection"" is a boxed collection of the four Futurama movies. In fact the collection is simply four individual DVDs within their individual cases that are sold together by Amazon as a single package. It is no different from purchasing them separately.

However, please note that there is a price advantage. At the time of writing (April 2009), the collection costs $72, while purchasing them individually would cost $90.",1240185600,12,495,5.111111111111111
