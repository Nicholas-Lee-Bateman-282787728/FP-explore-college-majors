8432019,4,B004JW6WHA,"This disk played just fine on my computer, though it wouldn't play on my US-model DVD player of course--the Amazon listing warned about that. If you like WWII-era movies (or slightly after), this might be for you. It DOES have English subtitles. It features ""snappy"" dialog, many sight gags, and the overall feel of a 50's-era night club burlesque routine. If that suits you, then you might enjoy this one. If you like movie history, or Italian movie history (I know an expert in that field, as it happens), then you might be interested in this one.

Or, if for some reason you enjoy movies about firemen, especially bumbling firemen (and who doesn't?) then this movie makes a nifty pairing with The Firement's Ball, a Czech movie!

In my case, I bought it because it's set in, and bears the name of, the northern Italian town one of my grandfathers was from. He was a stonecutter and not a fireman, but that's close enough. Cool, I thought!",1382054400,,941,4.62874251497006
