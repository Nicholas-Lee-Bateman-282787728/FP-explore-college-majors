8506372,2,B000IMV3LK,"...the case promised English subtitles which it didn't deliver on. I'm guessing that this disc is just a reprint of Cecchi Gori's extremely hard to find original DVD from 2000 or so, which I'd read had English subtitles, so this basically tells me that it never had them. (Imagine if I'd tracked it down and tried to shell out more cash for the original copy!) Beyond that, the disc looks fine quality-wise, but the lack of listed English subtitles makes this a tough sit for an Anglophone viewer with no knowledge of Italian.",1397174400,,526,4.666666666666667
