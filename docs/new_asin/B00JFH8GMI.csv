6356532,1,B00JFH8GMI,"They took TOO many liberties making 'Composite' scenes, animals superimposed onto that of another. Not so much a documentary, more like  a sensationalised superhero movie. Doesn't respect the subject matter like the documentaries with Attenborough. This is just awful.",1410048000,13,268,5.871794871794871
6356533,4,B00JFH8GMI,this documentary was excellent about the critters we don't see  or hear much about..... probably because they are so small... the photography and how the movie was made was most interesting and very clever.,1409616000,,206,5.0588235294117645
6356534,1,B00JFH8GMI,"If like David Attenborough's and realistic documentaries this is not for you. Totally unreal and fake. The manipulation of the scenes is like watching a CGI movie, some image mixing gives sensation of watching a 60s movie...

I like Stephen Fry, but his narration is flat .... not emotion what so ever....

Extremely disappointing",1408406400,9,330,5.092592592592593
6356535,2,B00JFH8GMI,"I was very disappointed after purchasing and watching this film. The video is full of very obvious special effects, blue screen backgrounds, and silly noise effects. In general, it just felt very inauthentic.

Typically, I greatly enjoy BBC nature documentaries, but this one I was really put off by.

I feel that a nature documentary needs to maintain an ethic of authenticity, and not to ""cheat"" the viewer by manipulating the environment to such a degree as to rob the film of any authentic merit.

The narration by Stephen Fry was great, as I expected, but the film itself was not, in my opinion, worthy of his talents.

I do not recommend this film to anyone who appreciates serious, true-to-life nature films.

As for any upside to the film, it would probably be entertaining for young children, who might appreciate the silly sound effects and perhaps won't notice the blatant cinematic fakery.",1407888000,4,901,4.901315789473684

6356538,4,B00JFH8GMI,"Hidden Kingdom is about the small animals that are normally are not stars in shows or books. We get to learn about tiny creatures like elephant shrews and grasshopper mice, giant centipedes and chipmunks. In total there are 3 episodes that feature close to 100 different species.

Hidden Kingdom combines real animals and special effects (composite images, CGI creations, slow-mo, special lighting effects) to tell the story. I thought it was beautifully done, my husband thought special effects were a bit overdone. We both enjoyed it.

Each episode of the show is followed by ""how this was done"" segment and I enjoyed learning about behind the scenes information as well.  It is not a documentary, so if you are looking for a documentary you might be disappointed.  But  I thought it was beautifully shot and entertaining.

I received a review copy of the DVD with a request for an honest unbiased review.

6356539,5,B00JFH8GMI,"There are three programs, each dealing with two different creatures. Although the camera work is inevitably somewhat contrived it delivers an astonishing and lifelike result. I was less enamoured with the last program but the first two were an absolute feast. Stephen Fry is very different to David Attenborough but his measured and almost stately narration is crystal clear and beautifully spoken and in no way inferior to his predecessor. This disc is a gem.",1405814400,5,460,5.1466666666666665

6356543,5,B00JFH8GMI,An amazing video in Blue-ray. I love these videos. It was done by the same people that did Planet Earth/BBC. My wife just does not get it. Actually she enjoys them if I can trick her into watching them. That is the real feat. It really irritates me to tell the truth. I watch her crap which is schlocky crap. Oh well...,1437955200,,319,4.161290322580645
6356544,5,B00JFH8GMI,"Really a very good series and includes cutting edge cinematography that captures footage all from the view of miniature creatures.

It was quite astounding the contraptions that were built to get all this footage, and almost obsessive to a certain extent.  The amount contained in the bluray is abundant and you will find this both educational and entertaining!",1435536000,,361,5.206896551724138
6356545,1,B00JFH8GMI,"There is some tremendous footage in this show, some great camerawork and great locations/critters.  But they ruin it all with bizarre fake footage that seems to be partly CGI and partly just compositing various pieces of footage.  And the editing then tears everything into tiny MTV-style shreds.  Really disappointing.  For example, there is a great section on urban burrowing owls in Brazil.  But they rapidly switch to clearly fake scenes of an owl swooping across the beaches of Rio, with girls' behinds prominently in the background.  I'm sure owls make it to the beach, but they need to find a more...authentic way of documenting that.  Come on, BBC, you're better than this.",1434585600,3,681,5.026785714285714

6356549,4,B00JFH8GMI,"This is a pretty good nature documentary for the price. While it is not extensive or deep-delving into these kingdoms, it does provide good wholesome information about the natural world. I recommend it.",1420243200,,202,5.151515151515151

6356553,5,B00JFH8GMI,"I just had to write a review to counter the nitwits who gave this one star. Don't listen to them. They're the people you don't want to get stuck talking to at a cocktail party.

Hidden Kingdoms is spectacularly well-made, remarkably entertaining, and surprisingly informative. (Probably in that order.) I watch a lot of nature documentaries, and while this one may be tough to classify (a trait that appears to inexplicably enrage a few people) it is absolutely a must-see. And while perhaps no David Attenborough, Stephen Fry's involvement in the project should -- and does -- lend it some gravitas.

But don't watch it for academic reasons. Watch it because it's thoroughly enjoyable and visually spectacular. And ignore those who feign some kind of elitist outrage. Because that's absurd.",1414627200,11,791,5.076923076923077
6356554,5,B00JFH8GMI,"I ordered this for my 5/6th grade classroom. The kids love it! They paid attention and learned quite a bit from it. Being located in bush AK, it was quite the experience!",1412553600,,170,4.34375
6356555,5,B00JFH8GMI,I am an animal lover and like to learn about animals I don't normally see since I'm not a world traveler.  So this dvd is very interesting and very well videoed.  It was amazing to see how they could video some of the scenes.,1412208000,,225,4.090909090909091

6356557,1,B00JFH8GMI,Narration  is dull and boring. Subject matter is not my cup of tea. I like to see and hear larger animals rather than teeny ones and bugs. That's just me.,1411257600,,154,4.133333333333334
6356558,5,B00JFH8GMI,My six year old son loves this series. There are some scenes of action and peril for the small animals (as is a part of nature) but nothing to intense for him. Our favorite family nature film so far!,1410480000,,199,4.128205128205129
6356559,5,B00JFH8GMI,"Those who give a poor review because the series is fake or unreal may be missing the premise. Certainly other nature series have videography that is more majestic and realistic, because they're shot from a jungle blind, or tree top, or safari vehicle, or helicopter. We humans see elephants as giants, but elephant shrews must certainly see us as giants. Haven't you ever wondered what and elephant looks like to an elephant shrew(now that's poetic) or other small animal. Relative to size, the shrew runs faster than a cheetah? -- now that's interesting.

The closest we've gotten prior to this show at seeing things the way small creatures see them is very occasionally with small stationary cameras at ground level or in burrows. Until we can mount unobtrusive, tiny cameras on animals and develop tremendous motion-stabilization software, it seems to me that this program and technology is the closest we'll get. Since small animals, as seen on their level, can seem almost cartoonish to us, music and narration with a lighthearted touch seems appropriate. Majestic, awestriking audio would seem wrong. It's also a nature film that certainly should appeal to youngsters and, with this country's (USA) woeful scientific illiteracy, any help to get kids interested is greatly appreciated. If you enjoy the program for what it's trying to do, it is fabulous, quite unique, and took a great deal of work with as little reliance on CGI as possible (see the ""Making Of"" supplement).",1410134400,16,1480,5.065573770491803
8650546,4,B00JFH8GMI,"This is a fabulous video, but I expected to get all three videos, especially because the run time above is listed as 180 minutes.  I have seen all three videos by one click on Netflix; they may well run 180 minutes, once one includes the making of the films.  Each of the three videos has two stories, but a total of six stories available.  The Blu Ray disk shipped indicates that it has 43 minutes of video, which turned out to be only one video (of the expected three).  This is a 3D version and the ""making of the video"" is entirely different from the making of the video on the Netflix shown version.  Incidentally, the rest of the series is very very good as well.  I'm just disappointed that I only got part of what I expected.",1527638400,,733,4.27536231884058

8650548,5,B00JFH8GMI,"Best nature show I got in years, small animals are ignored for the most part but they are the most interesting because of that fact. Would love to see a box turtle or African hedgehog show.  Best photography too.",1504656000,,212,4.435897435897436
