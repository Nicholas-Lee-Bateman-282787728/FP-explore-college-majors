2307219,1,B0009OUB2O,"I have to agree with most of the reviews that were written.

I thought it was going to be Christmas stories with the princesses in the stories.

My 3 year old daughter was very disappointed too.

If I had known it was recycled material in the video, I would have never bought it.

I personally beleive it is a waste of money to buy!!!!

Very Disappointed!!!!!!",1130889600,10,360,4.393939393939394
2307220,1,B0009OUB2O,"Highpoints: Recycled material and bad dubbing.

Lowpoints: The new princess ""animations"" (and I use that term loosely) are dreadful. Cheesey computer graphic stills with moving lips.

Disney should be ASHAMED for releasing this atrocity. They spent more on the cover art and commercials than they did on the content.

Avoid this stinker and buy your child one of the Sing Alongs.",1130889600,7,379,5.180327868852459
2307221,3,B0009OUB2O,Ok we just got this yesterday and have watched it three times already. The clips are old as other reviewers have mentioned but Sitting with my daughter and watching her enjoy them was great. These are so old my kids have never seen cartoons like these! The DVD has bonus features that are fun for my 5 year old. I wouldn't say go right out and buy it. With all the princess things out there you could do better!,1130889600,18,411,4.215189873417722
2307222,4,B0009OUB2O,"I know this got some bad reviews but the real question is - will it appeal to a little girl? This one definitely did. Adults (myself included) may complain about the lack of new animation and the use of ""recycled"" material but children don't seem to mind it (they love what is familiar). This is a very pretty movie featuring all the princesses watching a stage show with different holiday themed acts or songs. My 4 year old daughter liked how each princess introduced the next act (yes there is bad animation here - kids don't notice) and she enjoyed the Christmas songs and the stories. There are some older (from the 30's and 40's) cartoons in here but they are new to her and she loved them - particularly the one about the cookie parade. I sat and watched this with her and actually enjoyed it. Yes - it is basically a rehash but done in a different way. My 4 year old loved it and that's all that really counts. I would much rather have my daughter watch this while I'm making dinner than the junk on TV. This is very pretty and very sweet - you just need to watch it from a child's point of view.",1130889600,35,1104,4.261904761904762
2307223,1,B0009OUB2O,"Don't let the title fool you. There is apparently NO new animation here. Simply a rehash of old 1935's animation and cut sequences from previous Disney films set to a new soundtrack and music score.

What really gets me is when they are actually forced to create new animation (so the princesses can introduce each rehashed clip) that they apparently hired a low paid website designer to animate them using Macromedia Flash.  It's like the whole DVD is nothing but a collection of the special features you get on other DVDs.

This movie was done as quickly and low budget as possible to milk the Christmas holidays. Very, very disappointed as was my 4 year old. They even felt the need to completely remove any attachment to the real meaning of Christmas, going as far as to call it ""Chrissymas"" in one sequence!

Do not buy this disappointing DVD.",1130803200,8,848,4.671140939597316
2307224,1,B0009OUB2O,"I hate to give this a bad review but the movie is a disappointment, it has a feeling that Disney rushed it out just for holiday shopping time. The movie takes the approach that you the viewer are at the theatre watching a production. The movie is screen shots or scenes from other Disney princess movies and several older Disney short moves that are much older then the princess movies. Examples are Cookie Carnival 1935 and Once Upon a Wintertime 1940's. These are nice if you are looking for these short films but are not what little ones are expecting, my princess loving child lost interest after the 5th song.",1130803200,9,614,4.590909090909091
2307225,1,B0009OUB2O,"My 8 year old daughter waited for weeks for this movie to come out.  They took parts from other movies instead of writing a new story line.  Also, she thought it was going to be about something completely different based on the commercials.  It was very disappointing seeing her so sad after watching this movie.

2307249,4,B0009OUB2O,"This DVD added a special Princess flavor to our holiday season. Some of the stories may be "" lifted"" or ""recycled"" from other Disney films, but they were still very enjoyable.",1367280000,,175,4.67741935483871
2307250,3,B0009OUB2O,"I'll start by reviewing this from the perspective of my 3 year old daughter, since that's the one that really counts.
She loves this video because it contains lots of Disney princesses and singing and holiday-themed stories. It's colorful and has lots of pink. She wants to watch it every day, even in April.

Now for the adult review;
This ""movie"" is terrible. Everything in it is simply recycled video from other Disney productions, except for sloppily-written opening and closing songs, which use old clips as well, and some segways that are more on a quality level of South Park than Disney. Some of the mini-stories have NOTHING to do with Christmas and near the end, they're reduced to showing old 1940s cartoons that have absolutely nothing to do with Disney or princesses. I would be amazed if this video took 3 people more than a week to produce.

The bottom line, this video is for my daughter and not myself, so as long as there is nothing objectionable in it, it's her opinion that counts. She loves it, so it was a good buy for less than $2.",1366329600,2,1054,4.571428571428571
2307251,4,B0009OUB2O,This movie is a great way to keep children entertained while not having to worry about the message it is portraying. It is a classic Disney representation and definitely is a lot better than what is produced today for children. Definitely is a great addition to anyone's Disney library.,1359676800,,286,4.857142857142857
2307272,2,B0009OUB2O,"my daughters begged for this and then were seriously disappointed. Nothing at all new or fresh: just a tired reworking of the same material. One new Belle song, but if you have Belle's Enchanted Christmas, you have it.",1359504000,,218,4.7631578947368425
2307273,5,B0009OUB2O,My son watches this movie almost everynight at bedtime.  He likes the Beauty and the Beast track the best.  He somehow misplaced his original dvd and was lost without it.

2307275,1,B0009OUB2O,"Let me start off by saying I know how awfull parts 2 and 3 are to the dinsney cartoons, only a few are actually good, like the dalmation part 2, and spy kids part 2, so with that being said, I took an enormous leep of faith buying this xmass movie that my 4 year demanded to have, my hopes and expectaions were low, and of course disney did what I knew they would do, just make anything that sells, this movie is sooo bad I wouldnt even keep it if some one gave it to me, but I did threw a few dollars into buying it used, :( the princesses are all seperate, don't even sound like the princesses, terrible voice over, about 95% of the so called movie is make up of, some non related disney cartoons, then there is a recap of the beauty and the beast xmass movie, then ther is a mini short of the little mermaid,, when you do see the princesses, its for like 20 seconds each, totaly pathetic, think I lost some brain cells watching this",1296604800,,935,4.086956521739131
2307276,2,B0009OUB2O,The quality of the video was fine.  The content quality was not what we expected. We were hoping for a Disney Princess Christmas of Enchantment with all the princesses together.  Most of the video content did not even have anything to do with a princess.  They were individual narrators for silly clips of poor quality animation and still picture stories.  Felt that this was a rip off by Disney.  Unfortunately the 2 and 4 year old were fine with it.,1294876800,,451,4.5875

I bought this thinking it was a dvd where all the Princesses were to be together, in a castle, to prepare and celebrate Christmas, along with their respective Princes.  Instead, it's a collage of either extracts from seperate Christmasy Disney movies with a princess, or shorts of Christmas themed Disney cartoons from the 1940-60s which have no relevance to the Princesses themselves.",1245715200,2,524,4.954545454545454

If you like rehashed older cartoons that you can get on better DVD sets and crappy animation that makes the princesses look robotic, go ahead and waste your money on this one.  Otherwise, skip it.

2307290,4,B0009OUB2O,"I'm game for most things Disney, so when I saw ""Disney Princess: A Christmas of Enchantment,"" I thought it was worth a look. I wasn't disappointing, this is a great DVD for the holidays.

This DVD features a packaging of content wrapped around theatrical stage and narration by the Disney princesses. It also includes a couple of neat songs from them, such as a Disney princess version of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas.""

The stories are generally things that have been seen in past productions, but since I hadn't seen of it before, I enjoyed it and it made me want to check out some more of it. My favorite was the content from ""Beauty and the Beast: An Enchanted Christmas."" This is a sweet story about the time Belle put together a Christmas celebration during the time when the castle was still under the spell. This is a shortened version of the tale, but is told very nicely by Belle and it's a good edit. The other story featuring a Disney princess was a Christmas tale (I believe pulled from one of the learning DVDs.) about how Ariel and her friends celebrated ""Chrissymas."" It's a cute, funny little story.

The other content is stuff that some people may call old and boring, but I call classic. It includes a silent (as in no dialogue) retelling of the story of the Tin Soldier and a few other such classic Disney pieces, some silent, some not. This was stuff largely made in the early Disney days and while it lacks some of the flash of today's films, the stories are still strong. While I enjoy today's animation, you have to work with what you have, and these are a great example of doing the best with that.

So, if I truly think this DVD is enchanting, then you may be wondering why I gave it four stars and not five. That would be because of the special features. While this DVD does have a couple half-way decent special features, I believe DVDs must have truly great special features in order to earn a five-star rating from me.",1134950400,7,1949,4.466292134831461
2307291,1,B0009OUB2O,"My wife and I thought this DVD would be all Christmas songs along with Princesses either singing them or dancing, but boy, were we wrong. It has bunch of real boring cartoons that they hardly give you any warm feeling about Christmas.",1134864000,11,234,4.595238095238095
2307292,2,B0009OUB2O,"My daughter, almost 2 1/2, is really, really into the Disney Princesses. I encourage her to notice that they are smart, kind, generous, etc. and not so much on the ""princess"" part. I expected a lot from this DVD, since it was the big holiday release, but in all honesty, my daughter got really bored, really fast, and I honestly can't blame her. The Snow White story, though cute and very retro, wasn't a real attention grabber and had no educational value at all. Truth be told, she liked the last story best and only because the horses saved the day! It wasn't the worst, but wasn't the best either.

Yes, the princess animation between the shorts is cheap, but it doesn't seem to bother my 4yr old.  She gets excited about seeing the princesses all the same.  I got the DVD for $10 and thought it was well worth it.",1134259200,3,555,4.382352941176471
2307294,1,B0009OUB2O,"A few comments about why I didn't like the video for my daughter

- The DVD is cheaply done.  The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving, while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he doesn't move at all.

- The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas.  The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example.

Overall the video is not at all suited for young children.",1133740800,8,658,4.5423728813559325
2307295,1,B0009OUB2O,"Like so many others, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. Reading the back of the case does not help to inform the buyer of what this DVD is really like. And the TV previews of it just show the princesses singing together, which happens to be the finale (and best part, in my opinion) of the show. But the rest of the DVD is not a story about the princesses at all. They are just sitting in a theater, ""watching"" very old cartoon clips, each of which is introduced by a princess before it begins. My 3 1/2 year old was confused at first about what was going on (we were expecting a STORY about the princesses!) and did not like the fact that in  several of the cartoons, the characters do not speak. She also did not like the ""evil"" jack-in-the-box, which is in the very first cartoon clip. (Not a nice way to start a ""Christmas"" movie!) I would DEFINITELY choose something else if I had it to do over again! I agree that the advertising for this DVD did NOT accurately represent what it really is. I will be much more careful (and read reviews first!) in the future!",1133481600,9,1074,4.29064039408867

She enjoyed the princess clips, but putting in those old cartoons was an obvious filler  to make the DVD last longer and therefore appear a better value than it is.

2307298,1,B0009OUB2O,This is the worst case of false advertising.  Certainly Disney could have come up with a cute Christmas movie with all their princesses.  That is what they would have you believe they did from their advertisements but this was nothing of the sort. If you are looking for old boring cartoons that are foreign to our children and lack much luster then this is the video for you.  This video has nothing to do with Disney princesses being together and if I have the time I'm writing Disney about it.  They should be ashamed of themselves for getting little girls so excited about a video and then giving them such junk.  My money is more valuable then what I got and I will think twice before letting them have another dime of my hard earned money.  It's too bad they don't work as hard for their money as I do.

2307299,5,B0009OUB2O,"Disney Princess- A Christmas Enchantment was just that- an enchantment. My daughter who is 5 and a Disney Princess guru was not disappointed unlike many of the reviewers here. I don't know quite what they expected, but this dvd is wonderful for young Princesses in training. We are not D.P amateurs, this review is coming from a mother and daughter who have been to Disney Princesses on Ice, own all the Disney Princess movies, books and whatever else you can get. Many people are claiming how awful it was, but few are actually explaining why. I will explain why it's not bad as many have come to think.

The dvd opens with a beautiful grand entrance which the viewer is a part of. You take your seat in the grand theater and begin the journey with the Disney Princess' version of 12 Days of Christmas. You are then taken through several stories and songs in which the Princesses narrate, sprinkled with Old classic Disney Christmas cartoons. I did not find any of these cartoons inappropriate for my 5 year old. In fact, she watched them over and over again. It's sad to hear that the old cartoons are being labelled as filler or recycled material. Please remember that many of these Princesses are ""old""! Disney tried to make it enjoyable for both the child and the parent, and the nostalgic cartoons were a great bonus.

One of my daughter's favorite parts of the dvd was the intermission. During the intermission, you are taken to a menu screen where you can choose a Princess to decorate a tree for. They give you choices for ornaments, tinsel and a tree topper based on the movie they appeared in. So not only are you decorating, but you are testing your Princess trivia skills. In the end, the trees glow and change color and the Princess whose tree was decorated sings a Christmas song for you.

The Princesses were very clearly a part of this dvd unlike what one reviewer says. They are the narrators and all of the games and activities are about them, and they do appear on the screen. Just watch the beginning of the dvd and you will see them in the grand theater as well as throughout the dvd itself. I am very disappointed that so many reviewers are being so hard on this dvd. My daughter and I both love it and have watched it over and over again. It will definitely be something that she will have a memory of watching each Christmas.",1132704000,85,2350,4.511737089201878
2307300,3,B0009OUB2O,Not all about the Princesses. A lot of clips from past shows...some not including the Princesses. This doesn't seem to bother my 4 year old. She still loves it and get's very excited when Ariel's parts are on. I would recommend it.,1132531200,2,231,4.523809523809524
2307301,1,B0009OUB2O,"My daughter was soooo excited about this DVD, what a disappointment!  This really was just awful.",1131840000,5,97,5.0625
2307302,4,B0009OUB2O,"I don't know why this DVD is getting such a bad review.  My girls (5 and 3) love it!  I think the old fashioned cartoons and music are great. They are a refreshing change of pace for kids. Actually their favorite parts of the movie are the cartoons! By the look on their faces, I can see that it gives them that magical Christmas feeling.",1131494400,7,338,4.184615384615385
2307303,1,B0009OUB2O,"My daughter was very excited for this DVD to come out, having seen it advertised on another Disney DVD.  What a disappointment for both of us!  I agree with the other reviewers that Disney released this as an easy buck.  I felt the old cartoons recycled as part of this weren't entirely suitable for a 4 year old.  My daughter was frightened by the Jack-in-the-Box in ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" segment and the drunken rum cookies in ""The Cookie Carnival"" were cute to an adult but not appropriate for kids.  Disney marketed this well but it does not deliver!",1131408000,14,560,4.616161616161616
2307304,1,B0009OUB2O,"Me and my daughter were very excited to watch the movie and we waited and waited for the jasmine story about christmas and it never happened she was just in a song.  Nor, did you see really any princess in the DVD.  They should of named this the disney christmas movie. It was cheap in the voices and animations.  DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A PRINCESS LOVER.",1131408000,15,351,4.208955223880597
2307305,1,B0009OUB2O,"Although it shouldn't really be a huge surprise that Disney will spare no expense, unless they can help it.  Previous Disney releases are all based on recycled Material, all the Princess Stories are either episodes from the ""Little Mermaid"" TV series, or Jasmine themed episodes of the ""Aladdin"" Television series, while all the new stories are usually just scenes, either still or short moving scenes, from a movie starring that princess.  Although this DVD does contain some new content, two new songs and new ""Animation"" it's basically all stuff that's been available previously.

The ""New Animation"" is hard to explain, it's stiff, repetitive, and lifeless, although some of the cahracters original voices are here, others sound horrible, the voice of Snow White sounds like Fran Drescher with her nose welded shut and singing in a room full of helium.  Meanwhile, the ""New Songs"" are played with scenes from each princesses movie.

Stories Include ""the Steadfast Tin Soldier"" - taken from Fantasia 2000

""Aurora's Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy""- which just uses Aurora's dancing from ""Sleeping Beauty""- over and over and over-

""Belle's Enchanted Christmas"" is justa condensed version of ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" but leaves out the villian, and most of the storyline.

""A Merry Mermaid Christmas"" just has Ariel narrating ""Ariel's Undersea Christmas""- which is a story that was available in a ""Storybook with Tape"" set in the early nineties-

The rest of the stories are either classic Diney cartoons, or music played out with scenes from Disney films.

It's sad that Disney would trade their integrity for a quick buck out of the pockets of little girls, Dinsey  and Dinsey princess fans.

I would advise that if you HAVE to see this movie, borrow it from a friend, it;s not even worht the rental money.  It's sad to see so many classic Dinsey characters cheapened by such a shotty release from a company that exudes creaticity and achievement. Unless you're a die hard Princess fan, or have to have every Disney DVD out there, don't even think about wasting the money, you'll only be hugely dissapointed.",1131321600,46,2133,5.042735042735043
2307306,1,B0009OUB2O,"This movie was horrible...my three year old twins lost interest in it about 20 mins in...my kids love the princess usually. This movie had very little princess clips..the only main one was Belle and you could buy that movie intstead of just hearing the summary about it on this one. IF you are curious about this movie..trust me, just rent it...your kids might watch this once..twice at most. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!",1131235200,7,415,4.698630136986301
2307307,5,B0009OUB2O,"I know that there isn't new material on it. But the stories are pretty good. And the songs are super-cool.

I love this dvd, too.",1131148800,5,129,4.16
2307308,2,B0009OUB2O,"Like many of the previous posters, I was disappointed in this DVD.  The material is recycled and old and not at all what I expected.  The only decent segment in my opinion is ""Belle's Enchanted Christmas"" since it is actually a story about Christmas involving a Princess.  The other segments are simply introduced by a Princess.  The Ariel segment (""A Merry Mermaid Christmas Storybook"") is exactly that...a storybook.  It is a voice-over reading set to still images of Ariel and friends.

My 4 year old enjoyed the DVD the first time and has never asked to see it again.  Pretty bad considering this is a child who absolutely loves the Disney Princesses.

I think Disney should be ashamed to have released this under the pretense of it being a Disney Princess DVD.  The back cover should have clearly stated what this DVD was and was not.  But, then they wouldn't have gotten my $14.99, would they?  In the end, they are just a money-making machine and it all comes down to the bottom dollar, doesn't it?

Very disappointing...I say skip it and spend your $15 on the new My Little Pony Christmas DVD (""A Very Minty Christmas"") which is a much better buy.",1131062400,8,1155,4.635467980295567
2307309,5,B0009OUB2O,"I agree with the other person who said this needs to be viewed from a child's point of view.  This is a pretty film.  The princesses are on there enough to satisfy a little child, and Once Upon A Wintertime is one of the most beautiful pieces Disney has ever created.  Yes it is old, but timeless.

As for the Disney company wanting to make money, of course they do!  Doesn't everyone?  It doesn't mean you can't enjoy a film once you realize that someone is making money off of it.",1130976000,11,482,4.241758241758242
