8243336,3,B00120SA7W,"Although product details for this DVD clearly state language as English, DVD only played French audio w/ English subtitles.
Resident 9 year old found this frustrating even when I read the subtitles and fell back on my 7th grade French.
Art style and animation of film are very good. And story subject is rare & refreshing to see.
Film would make a nice addition to a French class, however, in copy we received English voice actors never got to make a pay check.",1526601600,,461,4.566265060240964
8243337,1,B00120SA7W,The DVD couldn't even work on any of my devices. It had some sort of lock on it preventing playback in my region. Wtf?,1505433600,,118,3.9583333333333335
8243338,5,B00120SA7W,"Love, love love this movie. I watched it over and over again. I was so happy to see how the animators depicted the Egyptian culture in its natural African hertitage. Truly beautiful. I will be purchasing two more videos for my personal archive. Thank you for this!",1481932800,,264,4.638297872340425
8243339,4,B00120SA7W,I enjoy this! It's great to see a well done cartoon with African descendant characters. It's a bonus for me personally that it is in French.,1410134400,2,140,4.423076923076923
