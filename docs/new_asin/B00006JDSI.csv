1779623,5,B00006JDSI,"If you are looking for the original 1922 silent film Nosferatu A Symphony of Horror by F.W. Murnau, this is the one.
This is the one which stars Max Schrek as Count Orlok.
This is the one that Bram Stoker's widow sued and a court ruling ordered all copies to be destroyed...
... but it survived.
Today it is now a cult classic and deserves a spot not only on the shelf of every horror movie fan, but on the shelf of anyone who loves movies.

The Classic Theater offers one of the most complete and restored versions I have seen and is definitely worth the price. Do not be worried that this is a DVD-R and is manufactured on demand when ordered. The disc quality is on par with any other DVD and the case it comes in is a good and study.

1779628,2,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu, 1922 film

The film begins with scenes that suggest the 19th century. ""No one escapes his destiny."" Knock, the house agent, reads a strange letter from Count Orlok of Transylvania and sends his agent Thomas Kutter to finish the deal. [Do the actors seem weird?] The name of Count Orlok surprises and scares the people at the inn. A strange animal is outside (a striped hyena). Kutter goes to Orlok's castle; the sun is setting. Kutter awakes the next morning to find his meal. He has two bites on his neck, the mosquitoes are terrible there. Kutter learns the secret but is trapped until he can escape. Knock the house agent has gone mad: flies and spiders!

Ellen awaits the return of Thomas. A ship sails the Baltic Sea. One sailor falls sick, then others. The captain is last to go. What is the matter with Ellen? Count Orlok arrives in Wisburg to inhabit that house. That ship lands with no living soul aboard. Is it the plague? This results in many deaths. A mob chases Knock, blaming him for the plague. What will Ellen do to rid Wisburg of the plague? Will Orlok make the mistake of tardying before departing? Will Ellen be saved? The plague ends as suddenly as it started.

The creators of this film were sued for violating the copyright of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". They changed the names but this story tracks ""Dracula"". This appears to be a low budget film. Setting this story in the 19th century seems more credible than the 20th century. The fall in 1921 for agricultural prices was worldwide. Does a recession create a market for horror pictures? The 1932 Hollywood film ""Dracula"" remains the classic version of this story. [Were the ears of ""Mister Spock"" copied from Orlok?] Horror stories like these died out after victory in WW II and the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. Horror films then were based on ""science"" (like giant ants or invaders from space). Will more horror films be produced in the current recession? One consolation is that horror films will never become a TV series.

In this and other films the bite of a vampire is shown as two small punctures about 3 cm apart. That represents a small mouth like a snake or small animal. How much blood could be extracted that way? Would there be enough calories? If not, that is proof for the non-existence of vampires.",1477094400,,2304,4.639705882352941

It seems to me that it is a poor quality public domain transfer to DVD. Additional drawback is an extra text (apart from translated German original), in my opinion absolutely unnecessary. Some small details, which I remember from my first encounter with this movie, seems to me to be lost, and thus some of the fantastic atmosphere sadly disappeared.

1779652,5,B00006JDSI,"As a rule I am not a fan of silent movies, however I am a huge fan of the ""classic horror"" genre. I found Nosferatu to be a pleasant surprise both in general viewing pleasure and in being a movie far ahead of its time as far as its use of special effects! For example it had the vampire simply appear and disappear rather than turn into a bat or a wolf. Also having read Bram Stoker's novel Dracula I found the character of Nosferatu to be much closer to Stoker's conception. Having said that however, in my mind Bela Lugosi will always be the standard by which all other ""Draculas"" should and will be held up as the measuring stick to or at least played against.",1468713600,,663,4.228346456692913

1779680,4,B00006JDSI,"I have now watched all the versions of this film I can find.  While I was deeply appreciative of the extra footage in this version, I found the sound effects (Knock's laughter, the breathing, creaking, etc.) overbearing and rather distracting.  Further I found some of the subtitles to be presumptuous based on what is actually known about the context of the film.  Nonetheless BIG kudos for subtitles rather than intertitles - such a pleasure to see the film uninterrupted.  The musical selection at the end of the film felt rather out of place considering its previous use in another well known film.  Still, from my point of view you cannot go wrong with this film no matter which version you watch!",1462838400,,702,4.768595041322314

1779682,5,B00006JDSI,"Previous to this version, I had seen a few lousy bootleg copies with the usual grain, scratches, and weird thumping on the audio track.

Kino has done a great job in creating a sharp picture with high contrast--so important to the old black and white pictures. They have also done a great job in researching and reconstructing the original soundtrack by Hans Erdmann. The stereo sound is excellent, the orchestra and conductor sound very committed and enthusiastic. Finally, the restoration team has added color tinting to the picture. The actual tints used were based on input from silent-film experts. The use of tinting conveys a sense of characters' inner lives in the absence of dialogue.

Here's my question. Kino has gone a long way in making an old B&W classic much more palatable and enjoyable to the modern viewer. It's only 94 minutes long, but at times you can't help staring at your watch or checking the little digital clock read-out on your Blu-ray player. Right now the movie is certainly entertaining and frightening, but I think Murnau's Nosferatu is close to becoming a museum piece rather than a living piece of cinema.

In some respects, the movie is very modern. Murnau is especially good at shooting different planes of action in different locations while all happening at the same time. I've noticed that some very famous contemporary directors--Lucas, Spielberg, and Carpenter, to name a few--have had some trouble with it. Murnau is also good at getting tricky shots in difficult and tight locations, very impressive when you consider movie cameras then were probably the size and weight of 80's-style microwave ovens. I'm not sure what he did to get the strange motion effect of Nosferatu's horse-drawn carriage, but it's always one of my favorite moments. I'm impressed that Murnau would have that kind of knowledge about the actual mechanics of film-making at such an early stage of its development.

In the end result, though, when watching Nosferatu, I'm always grateful for our current state of cinema and amused at what audiences back then considered good entertainment.

Excellent features, useful essay inside DVD cover. Top-notch product, but aimed squarely at professors and students. Anyone else might wonder what the fuss is all about, which is not Murnau's fault, but rather a result of how much film-making has improved since his time.",1456617600,,2376,5.0664961636828645
1779683,4,B00006JDSI,"We enjoyed this a lot. You'll definitely know what's going on more if you've read the book (""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker).

Nevertheless, quite a good telling of the story.",1455840000,,397,4.685714285714286

1779734,5,B00006JDSI,"This is a review for the new 2015 re-release of Kino`s Nosferatu(released March/22)starring,among others, Max Schreck,Gustav von Wangenheim,Greta Schrder and Alexander Granach. This is Murnau's film piece that he is most remembered for today. This film would be closer to Stoker's book than the Hollywood remake starring Lugosi(but still not right on,because Murnau and company didn`t even ask permission from the Stoker estate!).
The story starts in a fictional German town called Wisborg. A real estate agent called Knock calls on one of his employees,Thomas. He wants him to go to Transylvania to seal a  deal with a Count Orlock to buy a home right across the way from Thomas's. It's an old,creepy and run down looking place,but a sale is a sale. His wife Eillen is filled with fear upon hearing the news. Assuaging her feelings as best he can,he is soon off.
It is a long trek to Transylvania and he is forced to stay overnight at a local inn before continuing his journey the next day. While there he comes across a small tome on Vampires,which explains their habits and what one must watch out for. Thomas thinks nothing of it and next day he is off to the castle in a coach. The coach only goes part way as its' drivers will not go any farther. Thomas is forced to hoof it to the Count's castle,but a strange coach soon arrives at break neck speed to pick him up and get him to the castle toute suite. He arrives just before midnight. After supper the mysterious Count pleads with Thomas to stay up with him until morning.
The camera fades out and when it fades back in Thomas awakes the next morning in his chair,with his head tilted to one side. He soon discovers two small punctures in his throat,which in a letter later to his wife he explains as two mosquito bites. Thomas has to spend another day and night at the castle,during which time the Count signs the deal for the old house in Wisborg. However later that night,much to Thomas's horror,the Count pays an unwelcome visit to Thomas' room. Later,upon awakening from a strange sleep,he makes a makeshift rope out of bed sheets and climbs down the castle tower. But the sheets only go so far and he is forced to jump,injuring himself. The following day the Count is up early and fills a wagon with several coffins,which he drives to the docks to be shipped to Wisborg.
Thomas is taken to a local hospital to recover. He is delirious for a time, but eventually regains enough self control to head back home as quick as he can get there,sensing a terrible unknown danger. The Count meanwhile has had his coffins loaded aboard ship and is already sailing to Wisborg. Along the way mysterious ""plagues"" erupt at various ports wherever the ship docks. On the last leg of the journey the ship itself becomes the Count's ""playground"", and the crew dies one by one,until he is the only one""alive"".Thomas arrives home on the same morning as the Count reaches Wisborg,in the early morning hours carrying his own coffin to his new home. It is not too long after that the town starts experiencing a ""plague"" of its own. People start falling like flies. Thomas' wife reads parts of the small book he had picked up at the inn. One passage states that only an innocent's blood that keeps a vampire from resisting the call of the morning crow, will be able to kill it. One night Thomas's wife awakens from a sound sleep,while the Count across the way beckons to her. She manages to awaken Thomas to go get the local doctor. She falls back down on the bed and  the Count comes a-calling,gorging himself on her blood. However the call of the crow echoes later through the town and the Count is caught out in the sunlight with no place to go. As the rays surround him he disappears into a puff of smoke. Thomas arrives with the doctor just as Eillen dies in his arms,but knowing she has freed the world from the Counts spell.
I have seen many,MANY versions of this film over the years. All truncated forms of what I saw on this disc. This is the most complete,comprehensive and very best print of this film I have ever seen. In fact it looks better than Kino`s recently re-released Phantom of the Opera,filmed three years later. The orchestral score is the original 1922 score from its premiere and it is spectacular.
Technically the film is in its fulls screen version and it`s clear and crisp. It has many artifacts of its age but it has been cleaned up beautifully. Disc one has the English title version,along with the extras which include a featurette on the film and its making,an image gallery and excerpts from many of Murnau`s early 20`s films.
All in all a wonderful addition to any film buff`s collection. Remastered in Hi-Def,this print is arguably the best ever presented for this film. The story is much fuller,thus creepier and scarier. Fully tinted,this is the one to own. Highly recommended.",1446336000,,4855,4.631090487238979

I had Nosferatu in a cheap set of horror movies, and, as you would expect, the picture quality was poor.  I did not know if the poor quality was due to the original film or the cheap DVD.  I decided to trust the other reviewers, and I am happy I did.  The restored picture looks like the film was made yesterday.  Well, not really; you can still tell it is an older film, but the picture is clear and clean.  I am impressed!
  The film itself is very good.  As you may know, it is a good adaptation of the novel ""Dracula"".  Stoker;s widow would not give the studio the rights to  ""Dracula"", so they used ""Nosferatu"" and kept most of the story.  The vampire looks great and menacing and there are creepy moments.  Before we watched the film, I discussed it with my students, and many of them knew the character from a SpongeBob Squarepants episode.  In that episode, frightened SpongeBob and Squidward are wondering who is flicking the lights on and off, and then we see Nosferatu (a still from the film)standing next to the switch.

The other more modern score is simply revolting: a quasi-disco soundtrack apparently designed by a burnt-out veteran of Woodstock.

Don't forget that this movie was made in 1922, and various parts or versions were lost over the years.
  This is a masterful movie that allows perfect viewing. Also, the music is the original score by Hans Erdmann. It is perfect.
  This story does not follow Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" book in every detail because permission could not be obtained to use the book as the source. That is why the vampire is named Count Orlok and not Count Dracula, and the movie is called ""Nosferatu"" and not ""Dracula.""

1779844,3,B00006JDSI,"There seem to be several versions of ""Nosferatu"" available - this is a review of the one streamable on Netflix. The film itself is a testament to Max Schreck and his makeup artist - with his spidery fingers and bat-like face, the actor convincingly terrifies the other characters and the viewers, merely by showing up on screen. It's not a great leap to the idea in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-the-Vampire/dp/B00005B6L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of the Vampire</a>&nbsp;from a few years ago, that Schreck was a real vampire, and ""Nosferatu"" was actually a documentary.

One problem is the image. The black-and-white cycles between magenta, blue, brown, and green, for no apparent reason. One explanation I have heard is that this was the only way to show night scenes, since the cameras and film of the time could not capture images in low light. If that's the case, I see nothing lost by restoring the film with corrections to the gamma and highlights, to give the correct impression of whatever lighting level each scene is supposed to be portraying. I'm not saying to colorize it - just to remove the spurious color that serves no function for a modern audience, if it ever did.

I could have overlooked this - it's somewhat distracting, but no more so than the lines, threads, and other flaws in the film stock. It is, after all, a 90-year-old movie. What ruins it is the music. The ""modern classical"" score is not only inappropriate overall, but ludicrously upbeat in several serious scenes. Music is so integral to film, especially silent film, that the choices made here are inexcusable. This landmark film deserves better, and apparently has received it in other versions.",1402790400,,1745,5.250896057347671

1779847,5,B00006JDSI,"NOSFERATU is one of my favourite films of all time, and -- having just bought the Kino Ultimate Edition -- I've just been having one of my periodic binges, to compare different versions.  Since the customer reviews for different editions are all jumbled together in a confusing way, I thought others might appreciate hearing some of the pros and cons of the different DVDs.

A bit of background.  I first saw NOSFERATU on late-night TV around 1980.  I had always heard about what a classic it is, and saw that it was finally on.  Even at 2am, with a lousy print and interrupted by obnoxious late-night commercials, something about it grabbed me.  A few years later, Nosferatu was probably one of the first VHS tapes I bought, in a (then) high-quality edition by Video Film Classics.

I started my binge with a DVD I recently made of that VHS tape, just for sentimental reasons.  Although later I got better DVD editions, I always liked the orchestral score on the VHS version -- faded though the print was.  One problem with so many silent film releases -- especially German Expressionistic ones -- is that they apparently think the best musical accompaniment for silent films is to use music by self-indulgent avant-garde composers determined to be as grating as possible, with the music having as little to do with the mood on the screen as possible.

Let me say first off:  THANK GOD for Image Entertainment and Kino.  Their releases are consistently excellent.

The Image DVD is definitely worth having for the completist.  Until recently, it may have been the most satisfying.  It has a good, appropriate organ accompaniment, as well as a fairly decent modernistic one.  The image quality is very good, with a nice job of tinting.  Interestingly, whereas my VHS edition was only 60 minutes long, the Image edition is 81 minutes long;  yet, I could see absolutely no difference in the sequence of shots and scenes.  I can only guess the Image edition is SLIGHTLY slowed down (although the 60 minute one didn't strike me as overly, obviously fast), and that there might have been a slight difference in the timing of the intertitles.

I was disappointed in the Image commentary, however, as it sounds like it's by a graduate film student trying to impress his professors.  I was hoping for facts about the making of the film, but it is primarily ""scholarly"" interpretation ... offered with the usual lack of qualification, as if the commenter must educate us lesser beings about the true, objective meaning of the film -- much of which seems laughable and more revealing of the commenter than of the film.  For example, he tells us that it is obvious that the hero and his wife are in a passionless, unsatisfying ""sexless marriage"" -- even though what you're seeing on the screen is that they can't keep their hands off each other.  Then we are shown the hero walking down the street.  That's it.  He's just walking down the street -- but we are assured that he is hurrying ""to get away from his wife.""  What?!

The 2004 Kino release has a comparable image quality to the Image release -- very good, with good tinting -- and it is somehow 93 minutes long, again with very little difference in the shots and scene sequences.  It is very strange to me.  There seem to be a few minor shots included that are left out of the other editions, but many of the old familiar individual shots seem to be held longer, with more at the beginnings and endings.  I very much appreciate that, as I feel I'm seeing as much of the film as is historically possible and accurate.  The big downer on this edition is the choice of either one obnoxious, grating modernistic score, or another obnoxious, grating modernistic score.

The Kino ""Ultimate DVD Edition"", however, is just that.  This is the one to have, if you must only have one.  It is the same 93 minute length, but the image quality is even better.  Incredible, actually.  The restoration, from the only surviving 1922 print, and the tinting are gorgeous.  I was seeing detail I've never seen before.  But the essential piece:  NOSFERATU is finally reunited with its original gorgeous orchestral score, by Hans Erdmann, painstakingly reconstructed and recorded.  In style it reminds me often of Beethoven and Berlioz, with some Romanticism and a few disturbingly modernistic, dissonant touches.

Too many people put this film in the ""horror"" niche, which is not inaccurate of course, but everything about it is marvelous, not least Max Schreck as Nosferatu, the most chilling creature I've ever seen, and simply marvelously acted. Murnau is always the most poetic film-maker, and the scenes in N.'s castle, the trip to it, dinner at the castle, the boat to England, none of these scenes has ever been equalled in evoking the other-wordliness of the subject. Nosferatu carrying the coffins. So yes, it is scary and chilling, but it just a great film, period.",1399593600,,691,4.766666666666667

1779851,5,B00006JDSI,"Without ever having seen this movie before the name Nosferatu the vampire and the image of a ratfaced ghoul with very long fingernails, I had seen varoius times before! I knew the image was from an old silent movie. But it's not until recent years in the 21st century that I started to discover german expressionist filmaking in the form of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Lotte Reniger's animated THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED ( see my review of this film on amazon.com) and now NOSFERATU! The creation of the DVD format has led to increased restoration of old movies for the clear DVD and even sharper resolution BLUE RAY formats. Disney's FANTASIA has been restored twice, the 2nd time being the best with a brighter, lighter image so all the detail and backround elements are clearly visible for the first time in decades! And MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ is eyepopingly beautiful after a 3rd remastering attempt!

While NOSFERATU was made on a low budget all of the atmospheric detail of the settings and photographic effects are beautifully restored and it shows on this dvd set! A dvd extra that reveals what went into the restoring and picture enhancing is both impressive and informative. I highly recommend both KINO'S METROPOLIS DVD sets, the 2nd one having more footage discovered, to see more great german expressionist filmaking! Looking at both METROPOLIS, ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED and NOSFERATU I get the impression the Germans were really ahead of American filmaking in terms of artistry in the 1920s!!NOSFERATU (ultimate 2- disc edition) has the beautifully performed original score made for the film in 1921! The KINO METROPOLIS DVD sets also have the original German composed score for that film and so does THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED have it's original german composed score! All three film titles sound magnicent as a result with crystal clear stereophonic sound on DVD!

It's interesting to compare NOSFERATU to Universal's DRACULA starring Bela Lugosi! A comparison of the script of the german silent film with Stoker's book DRACULA reveals that NOSFERATU doesn't use the spoken line "" listen to the children of the night, what music they make!"" that is in the Stoker novel but Bela Lugosi said that line as Dracula in the Universal DRACULA movie! The DRACULA classic has no music during the film's scences but NOSFERATU has the full blown Hans Erdman score filled with dramatic and errie music chords and when Max Schreck rises from his casket on board the ship headed to Wisborg ( in DRACULA the vampire went to London) the image of Scheck rising up with very long sharp fingernails and his ratlike face really does give one a chill up the spine!
One moment I found amusing and fasinating is when Nosferatu single handedly, carries one of his coffins with one arm on a small rowboat to his new creepy mansion! Earlier in the movie Nosferatu, in fast motion places his coffin full of dirt along with other coffins on a wagon drawn by horses and with his magic he makes the lid of the coffin cover himself in his box and then the wagon drives off with NO DRIVER to tell the horses to giddyap! You don't see Bela Lugosi do that!! Nor do you see any of todays teenage vampires do that either! Hutter's wife Ellen sacrifices herself to stop the vampire from destroying Wisborg by letting Nosferatu drain her blood which keeps the vampire occupied while the sun comes up!! Nosferatu has then failed to get back in his box before sunrise so Max Scheck holds his chest with one hand while reaching out the other upwards and then he dissapeared on screen! So no stake in the chest this time! This one is both creepy and classy! Highly recommended!",1396915200,,3661,4.781990521327014

This Kino version is a shockingly clear restoration of this old silent film, and despite its age, it still provides some very creepy and distubring moments.  Max Schrek's version of Dracula (Count Orlak) is a terrifying non-human, rat-like vampire.  His movements will bring back some of the worst nightmares of your childhood.

1779869,4,B00006JDSI,"This is the first, or at least one of the first, vampire movies. It's amazing how well realized it was given the early age of the medium.

Here's the scoop. Hutter, a businessman/real estate agent is sent by his boss to the Carpathian mountains to meet up with a count who wants to purchase a large mansion across from where Hutter lives. The trip is long and weird things begin to happen during his few days visit with the count. The deal is sealed and the count boards a ship, with some coffins, and sails toward his new digs where things go really far south.

This is a genuinely creepy flick. The sets, costumes, general art direction all combine to set a foreboding mood. And the effects, as primitive as they may be by today's standards, must have given the audience back then the major willies. Also of note is the way the vampire Nosferatu was realized. When seeing him for the first time he merely looks odd. But when you see him in all his glory it sends the creep dial up to eleven. The scenes where he is on the ship and the crew get sick or disappear one by one is unsettling. Even in such small quarters this mystery dogs the crew.

I don't know how much of the original film still exists, that is, how much of the original am I seeing here? Some of the story seems disjointed, as though there might be pieces missing. Be that as it may, this is still a heck of an outing. Werner Herzog did a stand-up remake of this in 1979. His is also worth seeing as he sticks closely to the original. This needs to be seen for any number of reasons. Film history certainly is one. But just for today's viewer to see how effective a horror film can be even though it was made with nowhere near the resources we have at our disposal now.

1779891,5,B00006JDSI,"There are numerous versions of F. W. Murnau's classic Dracula film in circulation but this is the best and most complete. I even have a VHS tape I held on to because it uses the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" character names on the intertitles. After Stoker's widow won a legal battle against the production company, the film was ordered destroyed. Fortunately copies were found. When the film was ultimately released, names were changed. Count Orlok for Count Dracula, Hutter for Harker and so on.

This package includes 2 discs. Disc 1 is a fully restored version of the film using several different prints found over the ages. For the most part, the result is remarkably good. In some cases, small pieces of film were barely salvageable however. This disc has newly translated English intertitles. The film is colorized which was a common practice at the time. With scene and mood changes, colors change along with it. Most prominent is the sepia tone but we also get shades of green, blue and red as well as the B & W standard.

Modern day film watchers will certainly chuckle at the acting, but again this was a developing art form. Actors were accustomed to overly dramatized actions, gestures and facial contortions for live theater. If you're not used to watching silent movies this will take some time to get over. There are remarkable examples of great filmmaking however that are worth noting. I was really impressed with the editing. There are situations where numerous events are taking place at the same time. Hutter escapes Orlok's castle and travels back to his home. At the same time evil Orlok is crossing the Black Sea to take residence across from Hutter's house. And institutionalized Knock is capturing flies and spiders while lovely Ellen falls under Orlok's distant spell. The cuts are well placed and nearly seamless, especially for a movie of this generation.

Murnau shot the film in Berlin and other German towns as well as Slovakia. Set in 1838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done. Murnau's visual style certainly influenced many to follow. Orlok's physical appearance today is also worthy of a chuckle or two but I suspect it frightened many at the time. For another take on this creepy look, you might want to watch Werner Herzog's 1978 remake ""Nosferatu."" It's a bit slow but true Dracula lovers should like it.

You can also see some of Murnau's visual style in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" from 1992 which I believe is the best of all films based on Dracula. Another excellent feature in this package is the reconstructed Hans Erdmann score performed by the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Berndt Heller. It adds a solid foundation for the film throughout. It comes in stereo or Dolby Surround 5.1.

The DVD package includes a second disc. Although I did not watch it from beginning to end, the only difference I could determine was that it uses the original German language intertitles which can be supplemented with subtitles. Disc 1 also includes a 52 minute documentary about Murnau with a focus on Nosferatu showing some original sets compared to how they look today. Interesting stuff. There is a short documentary on how the film restoration took place, some scene comparisons, a photo gallery and finally, excerpts from several other Murnau films. Whew!

1779892,5,B00006JDSI,"Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema.  The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair.  Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will.  No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible.  MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle.  The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations).

1779895,5,B00006JDSI,"I'm going to keep this simple.
Nosferatu is the original film piece based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' (enough said there for the plot and characters). This is a silent film paired with an organic often chilling score. Although it is not what anyone now days would consider scary, this movie strikes a deeper cord thanks to the black and white grain, stronger conveyance of emotion through physical acting and with it's original costuming. Personally, with Nosferatu and many other black and white horror films, I find it hard not to romanticize them. The ""monsters"" of these films although often getting a repulsive and frightening reaction still foster some speckle of a human trait that just makes you fall in love with them, IMO something that horror movies now days almost always lack.

Watch this, you just cannot go wrong with a classic such as Nosferatu. If you cannot get into silent films play a game with a friend and see who can be the most theatrical when reading the narrative boards!

The story was interesting and related well despite the lack of voice. I got a little creepy when the rats and coffins made their appearance, and the special effects had to be pretty strong for the time.  The color hue was interesting; at times your typical black and white, and at other times more variations of orange.  I guess that was Kino at work?

1779911,3,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu is one of the earliest Dracula films based on Stoker's Dracula. It is an unauthorized film adaptation by German film maker and the characters names have been changed to avoid lawsuit. Recent restored version I saw rechanges the character names corresponding to Stoker novel. But it doesn't matter so much when viewing the film.

The reason the film has classical horror film hall of fame status may have come from the presence of Max Schreck as Count Olsok(Dracula in the restored version I saw). Schreck's vampire character is not as gentlemanly as legendary dracula actors such as Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee. But his every move gives me creeps. In 2001 film ""the Shadow of Vampire"" Max Schrek played by Willem Defoe was portrayed as a real vampire acting as an actor. Great vampire actor indeed. The plot which links Bremen's 1838 epidemic and vampire appearance is also a cool idea. The movie was remade in 1978 and forms one of the dracula schools in horror film entertainment world.

1779917,5,B00006JDSI,"There are numerous versions of F. W. Murnau's classic Dracula film in circulation but this is the best and most complete that I have found.  This one runs 94 minutes, 30 minutes longer than other versions.  I even have a VHS tape I held on to because it uses the original Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" character names on the intertitles.  After Stoker's widow won a legal battle against the production company, the film was ordered destroyed.  Fortunately copies were found.  When the film was ultimately released, names were changed.  Count Orlok for Count Dracula, Hutter for Harker and so on.  This package includes 2 discs.

Disc 1 is a fully restored version of the film using several different prints found over the ages.  For the most part, the result is remarkably good.  In some cases, small pieces of film were barely salvageable however.  This disc has newly translated English intertitles.  The film is colorized which was a common practice at the time.  With scene and mood changes, colors change along with it.  Most prominent is the sepia tone but we also get shades of green, blue and red as well as the B & W standard.

Modern day film watchers will certainly chuckle at the acting, but again this was a developing art form.  Actors were accustomed to overly dramatized actions, gestures and facial contortions for live theater.  If you're not used to watching silent movies this will take some time to get over.  There are remarkable examples of great filmmaking however that are worth noting.  I was really impressed with the editing.  There are situations where numerous events are taking place at the same time.  Hutter escapes Orlok's castle and travels back to his home.  At the same time evil Orlok is crossing the Black Sea to take residence across from Hutter's house.  And institutionalized Knock is capturing flies and spiders while lovely Ellen falls under Orlok's distant spell.  The cuts are well placed and nearly seamless, especially for a movie of this generation.

Murnau shot the film in Berlin and other German towns as well as Slovakia.  Set in 1838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done.  Murnau's visual style certainly influenced many to follow.  Orlok's physical appearance today is also worthy of a chuckle or two but I suspect it frightened many at the time.  For another take on this creepy look, you might want to watch Werner Herzog's 1978 remake ""Nosferatu.""  It's a bit slow but true Dracula lovers should like it.  You can also see some of Murnau's visual style in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" from 1992 which I believe is the best of all films based on Dracula.

Another excellent feature in this package is the reconstructed Hans Erdmann score performed by the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Berndt Heller.  It adds a solid foundation for the film throughout.  It comes in stereo or Dolby Surround 5.1.  The DVD package includes a second disc.  Although I did not watch it from beginning to end, the only difference I could determine was that it uses the original German language intertitles which can be supplemented with subtitles.  Disc 1 also includes a 52 minute documentary about Murnau with a focus on Nosferatu showing some original sets compared to how they look today.  Interesting stuff.  There is a short documentary on how the film restoration took place, some scene comparisons, a photo gallery and finally, excerpts from several other Murnau films.  Whew!

1779920,4,B00006JDSI,"Again I was recommended Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror by a friend and I've heard that as a film fan I should watch it, and decided to like I did with Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis. I had recognized the name of the film, but that was the extent of my knowledge of the 1922 film. Before seeing the film I looked it up and found its history along with the history of Dracula and the vampire genre quite interesting. Nosferatu wasn't the first vampire film. I thought it was, but apparently the first film to have a vampire in it was even earlier in the 20th century with Vampire of the Coast in 1909. Also I assumed that Nosferatu would have Dracula in it, but it doesn't. The film was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel and the director F. W. Murnau and writer Henrik Galeen decided to make some slight changes. Stoker's widow Florence Stoker sued the company that made Nosferatu for and wanted all the copies of the film destroyed. She won the case and virtually all the copies of the film were destroyed, but of course a handful of copies survived. Nosferatu wasn't the first unauthorized film adaptation of Stoker's novel either. In fact it was the Hungarian film Dracula's Death in 1921, and was the first to use the character and name Dracula in film. Sadly all copies of the film have been lost. It was interesting learning about the film and early vampire and Dracula history, but onto the film itself.

The films story deviates heavily from Stoker's novel with the film replacing Dracula for Count Orlok (Max Schreck) and changing how he can move around. Dracula was able to move around during daylight, but Count Orlok couldn't. Being caught in sunlight meant death for the vampire. I'm thinking that is where that take on vampires and Dracula originated from and has been used in the majority of films and TV series to date. Also unlike Stoker's Dracula, Count Orlok doesn't turn people into vampires he simply kills them. Also changes the names of certain characters as well. The film follows Thomas Hutter (Jonathan Harker) and his wife Ellen Hutter (Greta Schrder) who live in the German town of Wisborg. Thomas gets sent to Transylvania to visit a client Count Orlok who is interested in moving to the small town. Along his journey town folk tell warn him about werewolves and people refuse to take him close to where Orlok lives. Thomas also finds a book with information about vampires, but he ignores it continuing on his journey. Arriving at Count Orlok's castle home Orlok become interested in Thomas's wife's neck, and from there it's raise to get back to Wisborg with a trail of bodies being left behind the traveling Orlok. Back in Wisborg bodies begin to pile up and the people believe it's the plague while Ellen knows it's the vampire Orlok and sacrifices herself to save the town and kill Orlok who loses track of time and doesn't realize its sunrise and dies.

Story wise the film isn't good. I mean Orlok's motives for going after Ellen just don't make sense especially if the sun can kill him. I mean he travels hundreds of miles just because he wants to bite her neck and drain her blood. There are thousands of people closer by in Transylvania he could easily get access to yet he decides to leave his safe home traveling hundreds of miles risking exposure to sunlight or having his ship sink just because at a whim he likes the look of a woman's neck. Now I'm no vampire, but that doesn't make sense and I certainly wouldn't take that chance, but that's just me. That bugged me throughout the film, along with why would he lose track of time just because he drank the blood of a pure (sinless) woman. I mean it didn't make sense. What didn't bother me was the silent film itself. You would think that a century old film wouldn't be able to stand up or keep my attention, but it did. After the first five minutes I basically forgot I was watching a silent film or that is was one hundred years old. I also enjoyed Max Schreck as Count Orlok. He just had a very scary and menacing look to him and gave a good performance. He's no Christopher Lee or Bela Lugosi, but he did a really good job playing a character who was essentially Dracula. I want to praise the music, but the music in the film wasn't the original score done by Hans Erdmann. The majority of his score was lost over time. I believe the score done for my version of the film was done by Alexis Savelief a French composer. Anyway whoever did the score did a great job. The music wonderfully matched each scene perfectly bringing whatever tone was needed from joyfulness to terror, humor, fear and love the music matched it perfectly. As a horror film I think Nosferatu is great with its score, tone and facial expressions make you believe in the terror and fear the characters felt, but like I said the thing that majorly hurt this film were the changes from Stoker's work that affected Orlok's (Dracula) motives.

Is Nosferatu a truly great or excellent film no, but it is a pretty good one that I enjoyed and it gave me a chance to learn about film history including the history of vampires and Dracula in film. Is this a must see I would say yes if you're a true film lover and interested in film history or the history of vampires and Dracula in film otherwise I would skip it most likely won't be for you with no load explosions or blood and guts or torture that people seem to need in modern horror films.",1356307200,,5425,4.516785350966429

1779931,5,B00006JDSI,"This is a powerful film, one which influenced many later ones -- and not just vampire movies*.  Its atmosphere and filming techniques have been much imitated.

Interesting and amusing items that I happen to know:

-- Many English speakers, learning that one of the things ""schreck"" means in German is ""terror"", presumed that ""Max Schreck"" was a stage name used only for this production.  From there, it grew into a ""mystery"" as to who really played the vampire (there was even a movie, ""Mark of the Vampire"", which proposed that Count Orlok was played by a real vampire).  In reality, Max Schreck was a popular leading man in early German films.

-- The corporatist villain in ""Batman Returns"" was also called Max Schreck.

-- The rats in the ship's hold have ""hooded"" pelts, meaning they are a domestic breed.

But some of the scenes verged on the ""You've got to be kidding, right!""  The scene of Dracula carrying his coffin were actually kind of funny, or maybe I should say, quite odd.  And his bug-eating servant was also interesting.  And what's up with Dracula walking around in the daytime?  The level of a willing suspension of disbelief is quite high!  But it is an interesting film and the cinematography is lovely.  I had of course heard of this film.  It is legendary, but it was just not very scary.

I've seen many silent films both on tv, online and in person as we're lucky to have an original silent movie house in town that still plays them with the original organ and sound effects, nothing has been as bad as this reworking.

1779934,4,B00006JDSI,"I can still remember seeing pictures of Nosferatu when I was a child and being creeped out. Images of the pale, bug-eyed man with claw-like hands gave me nightmares for a long, long time. While I've gotten to the point where monsters in movies don't scare me at all, there's just something about the look of Nosferatu that's still chilling. I finally watched the movie recently, and you know what? At nearly 27 years old, I'm still a little uncomfortable watching this dude move around. Nosferatu, the movie, must've been insane to watch when it first came out in the early 20s, and I can only imagine how people reacted at its premiere. Not being much of a vampire fan, I can't say that this is the best vampire movie ever made or anything, but I -can- tell you that it kept my interest from beginning to end and that a big part of the chill-factor it has comes from watching these gritty images in motion.

From what I've read, Nosferatu is loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula since they couldn't get the rights to the novel. We follow the journey of Hutter, a young man who's sent to the castle of Count Orlok to sell him some property in the city. Hutter leaves his wife, Ellen, with his friend so she'll be safe while he's away. When he finally makes it to the isolated castle, Orlok welcomes Hutter to do business, but during dinner, Hutter accidentally cuts his thumb and Orlok tries to suck the precious blood so it doesn't go to waste. Hutter goes to bed that night without any problems, but upon waking up, he notices two small punctures on his neck. Figuring that they're just mosquito bites, he makes nothing of it, and gets Orlok to buy a home in his city. The big reason for this? Noticing what a lovely neck Hutter's wife has when he sees a picture of her.

I haven't read Dracula yet, so I can't say what was done 'right' here, but man did they do a great job with everything. It's funny how a movie that was made almost 100 years ago with no dialogue can be so interesting. That's not to say that I think older movies are boring or anything, but Nosferatu kept my interest all the way through, while nearly every horror movie that I've seen from the past 15 years have been forgettable. Nosferatu moves along at a perfect pace, and again, part of the fun in watching it is the grainy picture quality. There's just something much scarier about these images with all the grain that works better than seeing something clearly in HD. A new soundtrack is provided for this version, since no original recording from the 20s exists. Honestly, the music sounds a little cheap, like it was all done on a keyboard, but it does the job. When Nosferatu approaches a victim, the score that accompanies the scene is VERY fitting. Oddly enough, one of my favorite things here was the shots of a book that Hutter reads, explaining what a vampire is and other things. They leave a lot to your imagination with the word choice. There's just so much great imagery here that I could go on about it even more. Nosferatu stacking coffins, slowly approaching Hutter with horrible intentions, the infamous staircase walk...everyone should watch this movie for these scenes alone!

There were a few parts that seemed out of place to me, like one involving a werewolf. It doesn't really add anything to the movie at all and felt like they threw it in there just because they could. But since it's such an old movie, and showing a strange creature was probably quite a sight back then, it's fine. Something else that threw me off was figuring out when some scenes were supposed to take place during the night. There were a few times when I couldn't tell if Nosferatu was walking out during the day or not because a lot of these scenes look like regular daytime scenes. Again, it's limitations of that period I'm sure. But the big one that I didn't get, which is probably explained if I read Dracula, is how a certain someone didn't turn into a vampire when they were bitten.

While I tend to not watch many movies more than once, no matter how good they are, I'll definitely give Nosferatu another go sometime soon. It may not be very rich in the story category, but it more than makes up for it with the visuals and style.",1339113600,,4216,4.485677083333333
1779935,4,B00006JDSI,"This is a classic movie, filmed well before my parents were even born and defined the entire ""Dracula"" movie genre.  Disk 2 in this 2-pack DVD contains the ""original"" release with the German intertitles. Disk 1 has the version with English intertitles and a goodly number of extras (more on that later). I recommend to ""view"" this film from Disk2 as this version shows all the surviving original intertitle artwork.  Keep in mind that Murnau presented this film with various ""tinting"" schemes (to evoke particular moods perhaps) and so, staying true to the original, this restoration is ""tinted"".  This is perhaps the one thing I do not ""like"" about the film.  It is artistically glorious but it wreaks havoc with picture uniformity.  Fritz Lang did not tint Die Nibelungen (1924) and that film & restoration is sooo much cleaner, but uncle Friedrich wanted mood tints... oh well, c'est la vie I guess.  That said, let me be clear.  This is a great film, and a gift to the world of the 7th art from the Weimar republic.

Moreover, we should all bow low to the masters who did the restoration work.  They have done wonderfully, admirably, magically.

1779936,5,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu (1922) is the movie that started it all when it comes to the making of countless Dracula movies over the last nine decades.  Even with it being a silent film, this movie has withstood the test of time, a victorious copyright infringement lawsuit from the estate of Bram Stoker, and a nearly lost musical score.  This movie is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897), but numerous changes were made to the story, including Count Dracula being called Count Orlok instead.  Even with it stealing from Stoker's novel, this movie is an all-time gothic vampire classic with lots of creepy scenes and atmosphere.  Max Schreck plays the vampire in such a creepy way.  I think the Salem's Lot (1979) vampire was inspired by Max Schreck's vampire, as they look very much alike.

The musical score by Hans Erdmann fits well in some places, but in other places it doesn't fit the scenes well.  This could be because a lot of the score was lost.

Overall, this is a classic that can be enjoyed if you like your horror very gothic and creepy and don't mind watching a silent movie.",1320451200,,1102,4.703125
1779937,5,B00006JDSI,"I am reviewing the film, not the disc releases (having just seen it on the big screen).  But I understand that there are two quality versions of this film: the two disc Kino release being the one most people go for.

But I was never a silent film fan until I watched this masterpiece, now I am hooked!  Instead of filling the frames with useless dialogue, the acting is what took center stage.  The movie is based almost exactly on the Stoker novel.  And the film creators were apparently sued by his estate (seeing how they changed a few names, combined two characters, and set the latter half of the film in Bremen, Germany instead of London.

But the film was amazingly crafted and features some of the most cutting edge film techniques of that era.  Despite being black and white, the director released the film with an orange tint signifying day, and a blue tint for night.  It is an impressive technique that allows the viewer to follow the film without any of the problems due to night time filming (again, of that era).

I have to say that I find Nosferatu (the vampire) very creepy, but also kind of fun at times.  It's a classic horror film that is not violent or graphic.  And the stairway scene near the end is one of the most amazing shots I've seen in classic film.

This film is not for everyone.  It is a silent film, so the dialogue is presented in print at various points.  And then, only the most important dialogue.  If you need dialogue, or overt violence in your horror films, then I would pass this film by.  If you love quiet, creepy, and amazingly shot classic films, then this is for you!",1320278400,,1614,4.420338983050847
1779938,2,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu is the quintessential vampire film. Made in 1922 during the German Silent Film era by F.W. Murnau, it has become a shining example of what true horror films are about, and is often considered one of the best horror films ever made. It is definitely essential to the collection of anybody with an enthusiasm for the art of film-making.

However, there are several versions of this classic, each at a different price point. This particular version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu/dp/B00005R87K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu</a>, while claiming to be the ""original silent vampire classic,"" is actually slightly, yet vitally, edited. One can notice that all of the intertitles have been reworded, and the characters' names have been restored to more accurately reflect this film's relationship to the book by Bram Stoker. For example, Count Orlock is herein know as Count Dracula, Knock is renamed Renfield, etc. Sadly, the editing of the intertitles, while conveying the same (or similar, at least) message as the original ones, removes a lot of the mood-setting and suspense-creating language that helped to make the original so great.

That said, the price point for this particular version is rather lower than others, and is therefore a little bit more accessible. So, unless you don't mind not having the actual original, go for a different version for sale on Amazon, such as this 2-disc version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu-The-Ultimate-Two-Disc-Edition/dp/B000VUQ4HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)</a>.",1319673600,,1671,6.260869565217392

The sound track on this flick is a bore/tedium and takes away the frightening element with added sounds that are just plain stupid. The music in most part is lousy. Orlock/Nosferato is a horror story not some kind of sick joke.

Bring me the pounding on the piano any time.

The 3D is remarkably good for a century old film. But they knew about 3D way back then.

Tromeo studios is truly pathetic. They are not campy. They have no talent whatsoever except for one middle aged actor who is polished among the most polished in the field. He takes a role, I assume when he flat broke.",1314057600,,682,4.528455284552845
1779941,4,B00006JDSI,"""Nosferatu"" is, without a doubt, one of the most influential films of all time. But let's clear a few issues with this particular product first. Being a silent film from the early 1920's, all the dialogue and narrations are ""subtitled,"" lacking a better word for it. These are actually moments where the screen goes completely black, while the text, presented in bold white typeface is displayed. Fine. This is how a typical silent film was made. But this version of the film is presented in full-screen, thus cropping the edges of the text, leaving the viewer to guess exactly what the last part of the passages say. People have complained about the screen changing colors throughout the story, but these people didn't understand that was how night and day shots were differentiated back then. This version (the one I have) doesn't have that, and where it makes the film more consistent, there's very little to tell you which scenes are at night, and which are in the day. Of course, Orlock can only survive at night, but the modern viewer is taken out of this as a time piece. And ""Orlock's"" name is the other issue. Murnau's film changed the character's names because of copyright issues to avoid being sued by Bram Stoker's publisher, and where the original prints had Dracula's name as ""Count Orlock"" (more sinister sounding, I think), this print uses the ""Dracula"" name in the film, but the ""Orlock"" name in the packaging. If you are young and uninformed, but still want to watch it, you may be confused, as this happens to various characters within. Consistency is VERY important to me in a book, movie, or TV show. And so many times, this idea is thrown to the four winds.

There is no menu; you put it into your disc player, and right after the copyright warning, the film starts on its own, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but when the film ends, it loops back to the beginning, forever replaying it until you physically turn it off.

On to the pluses: The quality of the film is very good. It is sharp and clear, remarkable, given how old the film is, and the fact that Stoker's people had all known copies of the film destroyed. A copy or two slipped through the cracks, and we now have this masterpiece somewhat intact today. And a lot of people prefer it to the later interpretations, myself included.

The appropriate good acting in a silent film, would be considered bad acting in a later film with sound, as all facial expressions and body movements had to be greatly exaggerated (wrist-to-the-forehead while one throws their head back with eyes closed, for example) for effect, and the actors needed heavy makeup to make their already over-the-top performances stand out better. With very little to go on, they used all at their disposal, and in this film, they did so to great effect. They leap off the screen.

Music has been dubbed onto the soundtrack, and this gives the experience of being in a movie house at the time, when an organist was employed. And as a plus, there is some orchestration, a nice touch, given this is a much later time than before.

And, of course, the story's two villians, Renfield and Orlock (I prefer calling him Orlock): Renfield is so deranged-looking in this movie, it almost makes one itch at the sight of him; large chrome-dome head, with an unruly ring of black and grey hair festooning in all directions, some black teeth, and a convincing look of insanity in his eyes. And check the eyebrows - holy crap! Just nasty all around. And Orlock, by any standard, is a terrifying sight. He is THE picture of corruption of the soul. Max Shreck portrays him with such conviction, my hat is off to him. He is tall and almost animal-like, with large dead eyes which NEVER blink. Watch him. Before he turns his head, he moves his eyes, then his face turns in their direction. He had a hooked shark-fin nose, long pointed ears, rodent-like teeth, long claw-like hands, and a stiff jerky walk which looks like that of a walking cadaver. There are two types of chills you can get up your back, the good kind and the bad kind. And he really can put the bad kind on you.

I don't regret buying this particular version of this film; but if the formatting was better and the names in the titles were correct, it would have gotten a solid 5-star rating from me.",1296864000,,4304,4.590377113133941

This is a Chronicle of the great Death in Wishborg 1838

The original story is as old as the Carpathian Mountains. A real estate agent Knock (Alexander Granach) gets a mysterious request from a far-off land; Count Graf Orlok (Max Schreck) is in need of a new abode. He sends his best man Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) to seal the deal. The mysterious being, Nosferatu, has nefarious purposes that will seal more than the deal and in the process is attracted to a tasty Mrs. Hutter (Greta Schroeder).

This is the 1922 F.W. Murnau's silent German classic adaption of Brahm Stoker's Dracula. The movie follows the book little closer than today's movies do. There were a few necessary changes. I believe that was the nature of movies around 1922. Max Schreck did an excellent job of playing the deviant snacker.

Although no variations can come close to this original film, many people think of Werner Herzog's 1978 film ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" as a good variation, This also being my personal favorite as I am a fan of Klaus Kinski. I suggest that you look at some of the others and see what you think and who you consider the real Dracula.",1294531200,,1193,4.666666666666667
1779955,5,B00006JDSI,"In 1922 Nosferatu was the first feature length vampire film to be released and to this day it is still one of the best. The story was essentially a rip-off of Dracula which almost got all the film prints destroyed due to copyright infringement. Thankfully prints outside of Germany survived and the film lives on. The names and locations here were changed from the original story but can still easily be seen as a Dracula film.
Max Shreck plays the menacing Count Orlok and with his rat-like features and superb makeup job is still one of the creepiest horror figures to this day. The cinematography and use of shadows in here are great and give the whole film an eerie gothic feel. Nosferatu is a German Expressionistic film along with other movies such as ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligarri"", ""The Golem"", and ""Metropolis"". Nosferatu is arguably the best of this style of film with Dr. Caligarri being a close second.
There are many different DVD versions of this film including many cheap low quality editions due to the fact that this film can be found in the public domain. I purchased the Image Entertainment DVD which is sufficient with a good quality transfer and original tinting. It also includes two soundtrack options that both give the film added atmosphere. The Kino video edition is also a worthy edition. Kino later released the ""Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)"" which runs 94 minutes and I would imagine to be the best edition of the film on DVD so far. The special features on the 2-disc version are The original film score, a 52 minute documentary, newly translated English intertitles, a 3-minute short documentary on the digital restoration, and lengthy excerpts of other films by director F.W.

One of cinema's greatest treasures of all time! this is the movie that established vampire films forever since it's release in the 20's around the world. Originally director F.W. Murnau was gonna make a film based on Bram Stoker's Dracula novel but didn't get the rights until in the 30's Universal got the rights for their Dracula movie, so he decided to make a movie based on it by changing names and locations from the book to something different yet it worked perfectly. This is German expressionist cinema at it's best with ""Metropolis"" and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", it embodies what we see in vampires since then on film and even became the first ever bloodsucker movie. It truly made cinematic history with it's iconic vampire influencing everything from Buffy, Dracula, Salem's Lot, Blade, and many others to even a biography film of Max Shreck called ""Shadow of the Vampire"" which tells the story of how the film was made including on Max Shreck acting like a real life vampire.

This 2-Disc special edition DVD contains both brilliantly remastered and re-orchestrated versions of this masterpiece such as the original German version with German intertitles with optional english subs to the newly translated English intertitles version with a beautiful high def transfer that looks amazing for a silent film plus the score in glorious brilliant remastering that sounds CD quality if you ask me. 2 lengthy documentaries, lenghy excerpts from other films by the director, photo gallery and scene comparison for this is a must have for horror films, vampire buffs and even cinema fanatics.",1288224000,,1960,4.9363636363636365

The movie was influenced by the German expressionist movement and has influenced many horror movies even as of today. The leading role of Count Orlock is played by Max Schreck and he plays it with such conviction that one actually believes that he could a vampire. The movie was directed by F.W. Murnau.

1779959,5,B00006JDSI,"Given all the fuss about them in the last few years, you would think that vampires movies and TV had only just been invented. But they've always been fascinating to moviemakers -- and ""Nosferatu"" was the original vampire movie, even predating Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula."" It's haunting, creepy and sometimes bizarre.

It's a very loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic story, ""Dracula"" -- a young real estate agent named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent to the Carpathians to sell a mansion to a reclusive nobleman named Count Orlock (the sublimely creepy Max Schreck). Locals refuse to go near the castle, strange creatures roam nearby, and Orlock makes weird comments about ""your precious blood!""

Yeah, you know the drill -- Orlock is obviously a vampire who has a craving for Hutter's hearty Germanic blood, and Hutter's troll boss knows what he is. Hutter soon realizes what Orlock is, but he's too late to stop the vampire from departing from his ancient castle and going to Hutter's own hometown. In true vampire tradition, he also leaves a trail of corpses behind him -- and there's only one way to stop him.

Given the current manias about stuff like ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood,"" it's both refreshing and humbling to see that the best vampire movies are also some of the oldest. ""Nosferatu"" is only loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel (though closely enough that it was ordered destroyed by Stoker's widow), it's absolutely soaked in gothic atmosphere and creeping horror.

Oh sure, ""Nosferatu"" has the overacting and goofy makeup of the silent era, especially from any actors who are not Schreck. But F.W. Murnau sketched together some truly brilliant direction here -- he coats ""Nosferatu"" in creepy silhouettes and freaky moments of sorrow and terror (note the symbolism of the venus flytrap!).

As for the vampire himself, Max Schreck simply RULES this movie. The other actors are decent, but Schreck is simply sublime as the rat-toothed, clawed, ghoulish Orlock, and manages to give one of the most subtle performances in any silent film. He's literally the antithesis of the sparkly angsty teenyboppers of current vampire crazes.

""Nosferatu"" is the original vampire movie, and remains one of the best almost ninety years after its release. Spooky, weird and yes, sometimes scary.",1275350400,,2301,5.090185676392573

Needless to say, it is NOT industrial music.  The music just doesn't work with the movie.  Any music producer could have a great time choosing the correct music to compliment the action in the movie, but this just seems to be dark/ambient music overlaid on a silent film.  The worst part was watching the terrifying carriage ride with mellow, dark, ambient music.  It took the terror and dread out of the scene.
If you like this movie (as I do) and you like dark music (as I do), the best choice is Nosferatu with the Type O Negative soundtrack.  Search Amazon for ""Nosferatu - The First Vampire.""  That one uses the music and the movie to their full potential.",1274918400,,834,4.483443708609271

So, I'm very happy with this product, it's an awesome movie, the T-Shirt it's good, and the DVD it's Great!. Something you have to know is that you're not going to get a High Definition Quality But that's because this movie was made in 1922 and by that time cameras were Primitive, But it looks fine just a little grainy. 3  Things I Love about this DVD are:

1. It has a different and high quality soundtrack (Seriously it's Amazing).

2. It has like 10min more than some other versions.

3. This is the ""not edited"" version, For example: The Name of The Vampire is ""Dracula"" not ""Orlok""

So, I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't  have any extras or subtitles (I really do not expect any bonus), and in like 1 or 2 scenes in this DVD the screen cut parts of the words out, but its just like in 2 scenes (and in that 2 scenes you still can read it and understand it)  .

That being said, there are some haunting subtle images in the film such as the images of the dark ocean as Nosferatu travels from Translyvania to Germany. There are some images that are also striking in their simplicity, such as shadows of Nosferatu creping closer to victims.

My only complaint about this version is the altogether extraneous second disc which merely includes the same transfer but with the original German title cards in place.  The set is still worth the extra money regardless.  I imagine Kino included the second disc so they could charge more for the set without getting complaints from the casual buyer about the price.

They were successfully sued by Bram Stoker's widow, and all copies of the film were ordered destroyed. Fortunately some still remained, and now can be enjoyed by everyone.

Okay so this may be a silent film, but boy was it scary; it was very very well made. Count Orlock is very scary, and the director did a great job at setting a very eerie mood. I don't like silent films, but I was curious about this one and checked it out from my local library. The next day, I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately I bought a different version which was heavily edited, had a crappy picture, the names of the charaters were change to fit the names of the charators in Bram Stoker's novel, and the music was totally different and crappy too. It cost me $20.00 and the video store wouldn't allow me to return it. Then I bought the good version from Amazon and it only cost me $7.00. You want the good version by Kino Video which is unedited, has a great picture, has the original charaters' names, and has two great musical scores in it. That's the one you want.

1779977,5,B00006JDSI,"There are really no words to explain how marvelous this film really is.

But, you need words to create a review, so I must try.

There are a few reasons to completely admire and respect this film.  The first, and most obvious, is that the film is impeccably made, especially when you consider the date on the back of the DVD.  Beings that this film was made in 1922, it is rather remarkable that it holds up today, but hold up it does.  A solid mixture of intense use of shadows (who doesn't remember with sheer terror the image of a shadowy figure ascending the staircase) as well as stop motion editing (that spectacular coffin loading scene is just chilling) come together to create a breathtaking cinematic experience that exceeds in almost every area.

Next to the actual camerawork you have some marvelous directorial choices that elevate the films mood and tone, and then there is the performances from the entire cast that just take this film to another level all together.

Max Schreck is the king of all the vampires, for his Graf Orlok is a devastatingly infectious blend of human suffering and pure evil.  While the film itself doesn't aggressively explore the more human side to this monster, Schreck's deliberate manipulation of character helps create someone three-dimensional.  Gustav von Wangerheim is essential to the films growth, especially in the beginning.  His theatrical delivery makes for a quirky and engrossing character.  Greta Schroder takes reins in the films end and completely devours her screen time, giving us a woman who knows her destiny and is willing to embrace it.  I also found Alexander Granach's humorous take on Orlok's devoted follower Knock to be delightful.

These are all obvious reasons to love the film, but the biggest reason is that the film itself is just really, really good.

The tale of Nosferatu is one of chills, thrills and perverse romance, and it is delivered spectacularly here.  `Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens' is the essential vampire film, for it captures all aspects of this twisted tale; the mood, emotional connection and delicious terror.  The final frames may have the edge as far as imminent horror, but the entire film carries a beautiful spookiness that cannot be matched by films today.  With crisp sepia tones and startling use of fisheye lenses and sharp angles, `Nosferatu' is an outstanding film that lives up to all expectations and puts most horror films of today to shame.",1258070400,,2460,4.932038834951456

But a few copies of landmark and exquisite German expressionistic masterpiece escaped and were the inspiration for German writer-director Werner Herzog's remake ""Nosferatu: The Vampyre"" (1979).

Pre-dating Lugosi's thriller, this silent film for me made me fascinated about the techniques of Director F.W. Manau that we take so for granted today.  The interpositions, the flashback, the scene to scene back & forth are all here.

This film is praised as an excellent restoration of the 1922 film.  The disc has a great ""making of"", not only of the restoration process but also of the life and times of Director Minau.  The film is in the German language but has English intertitles between scenes.  On the second disc there is the same film with the original German intertitles, but don't worry if you don't speak or read German since this has English subtitles.

I had no idea that silent film directors use tinting to represent emotion.  My experience with silents has been with Charlie Chaplain and the Keystone Cops.  This film puts them to shame.

Did the story scare me?  No, not really.  However the mix of shadow and reality did blur for a time.

The story itself follows the similar general theme to Bram Stoker's Dracula but all the names have been changed to protect the innocent (from law suits).  Unfortunately the ploy did not work.  Bram Stoker's widow sued and won and the film was ordered destroyed.  Fortunately some survived so that we have this great piece of film history.

It's a love story in a lot of ways.  Kutter and his wife Ellen, sweet & innocent, happy as I've ever seen actors be on film.  The expression of joy was really something to see.  Max Shreck as Count Orlok -- the rat-like features, long nails and pointed ears, looked more like a rat than anything.  (This in great contrast to the later incarnations of Dracula as an aristocrat whom the women adore and whose bite can change others into vampires.)

Rather than the bite of a stake, we have the blood & sacrifice of an innocent maid as the cock crows and Orlok vanishes in a puff of smoke.

The director was fascinated with occult symbology with plays a big part in the film's storyline.

For the horror aficionado, this is a must-see film.  The beginnings of what we take for granted today were pioneered by Manau.  Watch these DVDs and get a taste of what it must have been like to create in a new, untried medium of entertainment and expression.

A must-buy!

[In my research I also discovered a film called Shadow of the Vampire (2000) starring Willem DaFoe (Spiderman), where this is a back-story of the Nosferatu tale, except Max Schreck turns out to be a centuries old vampire who was hired by Manau!  Sounds crazy, hope it's a tribute!]",1255132800,,2720,4.60625
1779980,5,B00006JDSI,"I'd been reading about and hearing about this movie for as long as I can remember. And after watching ""Shadow of the Vampire"" with Willam Dafoe again playing the ""elusive"" Max Schrek,(and I still think he should have won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor, thank you very much), I decided to finally buy Nosferatu.

I held off for years because of reviews I read about poor video quality, bad transfers, etc.  All I can say about this issue from Criterion is that IT ROCKS!!!!  I'm not a big fan of black and white movies, much less silent films (Metropolis excluded). But I was very impressed with this one. The picture is crisp and clear, you see all of the great lighting nuances. It looks fantastic. And as for the villian, he is easily the ugliest, creepiest vampire ever. I don't know where they dug Max Schrek up from, but he was either one of the greatest character/method actors of all time, or ""something else"" entirely. Not that it matters.

Now I understand why they tried to [...] his look in the original film version of Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" instead of sticking with the way King described his vampire in the book as starting out as an old gentleman gradually getting younger with the more victims he has his way with. I first saw that when I was very small, and the first time they showed ""the monster"" I bailed off the side of the couch and that's where I stayed to watch the rest of the show on tv.

This version of Nosferatu is wonderful and well worth the money. I'm glad they introduced the original score back into it as well. It adds a lot of ambiance. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase of this wonderful classic film and I'm ecstatic that it managed to survive, despite the fact that all copies of it were supposed to be destroyed just because Bram Stoker's widow had her [...] in a wad over copyright issues.",1254009600,,1856,4.479289940828402
1779981,5,B00006JDSI,"When I was a little boy, I watched this film with my father. I was 6 years old and scared to death. For years afterward, I saw shadowed hands just like the shadowed hands of Nosferatu going up the stairs.",1253836800,,204,4.125
1779982,5,B00006JDSI,"This version of Nosferatu is the ULTIMATE vampire movie, it is still amazing and quite a special movie.

The story also differs in many points from the Stoker story, principally in the depiction of the count and the death of the vampire, so I don't quite understand how they lost the lawsuit with Stoker's widow, which called for the destruction of all copies of the film. Luckily for us, this never was done effectively and enough copies survived to guarantee the existence of this masterpiece.

It starts when the town's greedy real estate manager, played exquisitely by Alexander Granach, who was very talented at depicting creeps and had a long carrer in these roles, actually shows up many years later in Garbo's ""Ninotchka"" playing one, receives a letter from Count Orlock. The letter itself is a manuscript covered with magical signs, and the expression on his face becomes so horrid that one just knows this is bad news, yet he manages to convince his younger employee, Gustav von Wangenheim as Thomas Hutter of the power of Location, Location, Location and convinces him to take the trip for the purpose of selling the Count the deserted huge house across the street.

One of the best features of the film, is the fact that it was filmed on location, through not as commonly believed, in Transylvannia. The castle depicted, Orava Castle,  does exist and is in Slovakia, it is terrifying enough, and I for one would not go there, even under bright sunlight. The mountain range so beautifully depicted in the tainted bluish tones are not the Carpathian mopuntains but the High Tatras, located between Slovakia and Poland, but they  manage just as well to convey the air of mystery and ominous danger.
 You have to have the silly optimism and natural idiocy of the real estate agent Hutter to not notice the obvious signs of doom in the reaction of the people in the tavern, and particularly the coachmen, that leave him at the crossing of a bridge into the Count's estate. Soon another carriage picks him up, this is the scariest ride imaginable, yet Hutter doesn't quite catch on, with the horses completely covered in cloth and the expression of the coachman intensely deranged.

This Count Orlock as played by Max Schreck (this last name means ""terror"" in German, but it was pure coincidence, not an invention for the movie) is a scary, creepy, repulsive creature. No sex appeal or suave moves here, and though he has a certain aristocratic demeanor, very evident when he first meets Hutter, he is still just a monster looking for the next blood-feed. He does have magical powers though,  as he can, for example, get in and out of his coffin without moving the lid. His own shadow is like another character in the film, so intense is its evil reflection either on walls or victims. This vampire is still scary and quiet creepy after all these years and seeing so many other creations and variations on this theme, not an easy feat to accomplish given the popularity of this subject.
The film can seem long, because a lot of the effects depend on the time SEQUENCE itself, I found this out later when reading about the film, specifically that the director used a metronome to measure time, but while viewing it I must confess I was impatient at times.

Even after being bitten by the vampire in the night, Hutter can not make himself believe that this is happening and goes off to write his bride that the mosquitoes had done it. Never understimate the power of denial. Nevertheless he eats so well in the castle that he is able to recover and escape from his tower room and down the mountains before he faints and is luckily found be a good Samaritan that brings him to a hospital, where he recovers and hurries home.

He had seen the Count prepairing for a voyage and is afraid he will get to the town before he does. Next thing we know the Count's coffins are going down a river,he actually needs several to carry the accursed earth of the plague with him, rats included, that he finds most comforting to sleep with. The river is actually the  Vah, also in Slovakia, the scenes of the harbor and the town are from Lubeck and Wisborg, small towns  in Germany.

The ship takes the cargo in and soon enough the sailors start to die, one by one. They think it's the plague, but of course it's the Count feeding. He timed it perfectly so that when the very last man dies he has arrived.
The drawback is that he has to carry his own coffin into the house he purchased back in his castle. The scene is suppossed to be at night so understandably, he meets no one carrying it by himself, but I would have added a couple of magically conjured servants here, it was almost comical to watch the Count carry the coffin as if it were a package with his belongings. Coppola's Count would never have done such un-vampirical labor and neither would Belosi's impersonation. This is where I would have preferred to see the monster levitating from the ship and flying majestically in a brand new cape of velvet, preferably with some Eastern European Byzantine embroidery, or at least trailing a long one through the town square.

Greta Schroder as Ellen, is convincing in the role, but so unappealing I actually thought she was a man in drag in the first  scenes. As the innocent bride that is to marry Hutter, she has been 'feeling drawn to' walking in her nightgown on the balcony of her terrace, expressing 'longing' but whether is for the return of her boyfriend or the vampire himself is not clear. Upon Hutter's return she manages to read his vampire manual and discovers there that the only way to  kill the vampire is to have a young virgin distract him so much while he sucks the life out of her, that he may forget the sunrise and be destroyed by the light.
This information will help her save her town from the curse of the vampire in the last scene, which is pure magic.

1779994,5,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu is one of my all-time favorite films and I am glad so much effort was put into giving this classic a much-needed make-over in this Kino International 2-disc release.  The picture is so clear.  The only version I had before this one was the inexpensive Type O Negative soundtrack release which I'm sure is not at the highest ends of the quality spectrum, so this edition was a big improvement picture-wise.  There is a 3-minute feature (in German but with English subtitles) showing how this digital restoration was done frame-by-frame.  The film is also color-tinted which is what was commonly done in the silent era to set the mood of the scene.  The 1922 musical score by Hans Erdmann was performed and recorded for this edition (I prefer the Type O Negative soundtrack, but that's just me).  The film, of course, is timeless.  Most people remember Max Schreck's eerie portrayal of Count Orlok, but Gustav von Wangenheim (Hutter) needs to get more credit.  His performance is superb.  In the beginning he shows an arrogant confidence as he travels to Transylvania to sell the mysterious Count a house across from his own--although moments of doubt do creep up as he is being warned of the danger that awaits him by the natives or a vampire book, doubt that he quickly laughs off.  Later, he looks completely freaked (check out his eyes) when he discovers who Orlok is.

Special features include ""The Language of Shadows-- Murnau: The Early Years and Nosferatu.""  This 52-minute documentary details the life of director F.W. Murnau including stills of some of his lost pre-Nosferatu films.  The occult's connection with Prana productions (explaining some of the occult symbolism in Nosferatu, i.e. that strange letter Orlok sent to Knock) is discussed.  They sure found a creepy guy to talk on this subject.  The part I liked best about this documentary are the shots of the filming locations showing how they looked then and now.  Some locations have changed a lot or no longer exist (WWII bombing destroyed some sites), while others look almost exactly the same (i.e. Hutter's house). My one disappointment in this feature is that there was no background or information given on the actors in the film.

Other bonus material on this set are a photo gallery of stills and lobby cards, scene comparison between Bram Stoker's novel, Henrik Galeen's screenplay, the Murnau's film, and excerpts (scenes) from eight other Murnau films: Journey Into the Night (1920), The Haunted Castle (1921), Phantom (1922), The Finances of the Grand Duke (1924), The Last Laugh (1924), Tartuffe (1926), Faust (1926), and Tabu (1931).  These excerpts are from 2-11 minutes long and have their own music soundtrack.  The second disc is the film with the original German intertitles (you can have English subtitles with this version).

1779995,5,B00006JDSI,"Sometimes, I think that from over hundred years of Cinema history the best, the most creative and exciting years were in the relative beginning, in the first decades of the 20th Century. The old films that I've watched lately don't seem old - they are timeless. Their beauty and mystery -unsurpassable, their influence - immense, the pleasure they bring - incomparable. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens made in 1922 by F.W. Murnau is one of these movies. It is so finely crafted, so well thought of, so lovingly produced, so beautiful to look at, and so creepy and genuinely scary that I believe it will stay one of the best films of the horror genre and true inspiration for present and future directors, and not just horror film directors. A Symphony of Horror is a pure cinematic delight, poetry on screen from the first shot to the final. Werner Herzog came quite close in 1979 in his updated color version of the same film but I prefer Murnau's film a bit more, perhaps, because it was the first one and Murnau had no previous film to compare to or more likely, because no one, even fabulous Kinski could not be as creepy and frightening as Max Shreck.

The B&W photography with astounding use of sepia gave some scenes a somber dramatic, Gothic tone. Each frame deserved to be captured and enjoyed for the sheer beauty and elegance. The scenery was breathtaking, storytelling - solid and compelling. Hans Erdman's 1922 score created a perfect sound background for the story. The most fascinating asset of the film though was not even acting but simply presence of Max Shreck. What a mesmerizing magnificent ugliness that would not let you take your eyes off his face, fangs, ears, and spider like fingers.

I have recently gotten back into old films and find myself enjoying them more now than when I was younger.  Nosferatu and I mean the version from Kino has great film quality and I was amazed at how well it looked.  I have seen some really bad transfers from companies I guess trying to make a dollar and have them look like a mess.  Every movie so far I have seen from Kino has exceptional quality and so far I am happy with them.  I know people are picky about their favorites and I don't know much about the films history but it looked great in this version.  The sound was good as well with I think it was three separate audio tracks.  I have heard people get mad when the movies they like are transferred and look like garbage.  I enjoyed watching the camera tricks of the twenties and how the film was pieced together.

Murnau the rights to reproduce it.  Now, here is the genius of Murnau...He changes the name to ""Nosferatu"" and changes the main character to ""Count Orlok"" and bam!!! One of the greatest examples of silent films is made.

Murnau's faithful adaptation of the story brings images to the screen, the likes of which had not been seen.  The inherent sense of sinister makes the scenes that by today's standards are tame, for the time where considered edgy.  The amount of evil brought to the role of Count Orlok by Max Schreck has never been duplicated, not even by Bela Lugosi.  Lanky and slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes, this was Max Schreck's greatest screen role and would have no doubt made him a star, had it not been for that pesky lawsuit brought on by Stoker's widow (the real Dracula)...",1228003200,,1000,4.818713450292398
1780000,3,B00006JDSI,"Ironically, for a film that is 86 years old, ""Nosferatu"" starts off, like a bad, self-produced YouTube video.

Thankfully, it improves.

I've always wanted to watch the first vampire movie ever made and the one that is often considered the greatest adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."" Recently, I was able to.  It's an unofficial version and Stoker's estate actually sued German Director F.W. Murnau over it. All copies of the film were ordered destroyed.

Obviously, it survived.

Murnau, who died in a car crash at age 43, didn't even try very hard to disguise the movie: naming Harker Huffer and Count Dracula Count Orlok, leaving little doubt about the source material.

It's difficult for a generation weaned on special effects, surround sound, and the miracle of HD-TV to really appreciate ""Nosferatu"" (1922) without boredom setting in (even at a short 80 minutes). The pacing is arduous and editing reflects the limited technologies of the day.

""Nosferatu"" is black-and-white (and most versions, including the one I watched, are scratchy and a bit faded on the edges). It's also a silent film, the narrative constantly interrupted by written dialog boxes.

There's also a lot of overacting employed by actors of the day (after all they needed to convey in action what is now done through speech). But to modern audiences the exaggerated facial expressions get tiresome rather quickly.

Yet if you settle into the right frame of mind - there's a lot to admire in ""Nosferatu."" The highlight is actor Max Schreck as Count Graf Orlok. He's simply repulsive. Unlike the modern versions of vampires as charming seducers, Schreck's Orlok is a monstrosity. He's a hideous skeletal being with long bony fingers, ears like a bat, and fangs that look like they belong on an oversized rodent. There's nothing enchanting about him.

He's creepy. Very creepy. The famous shot of him rising up out of coffin - filled with soil from the graveyard of Black Death victims - his body stiff and straight - and it's easy to understand why the film has lasted more than eight decades.

Murnau accomplished a lot with his limited resources. He expertly uses light and shadow. In fact, Schreck's shadow could be considered another character in the film. And there are marvelous symbols scattered throughout the film: from a skeleton clock to the Venus Fly trap eating a bug. Murnau is able to cobble together a compelling narrative with few dialog cards, allowing, for the most part, the action to unfold.

But like any horror movie, the real question is: Is ""Nosferatu"" scary?

The answer, unfortunately, is: hardly.

By today's standards, the film would have a difficult time scaring a five year old. It has eerie moments - and Schreck is in most of them - but it's a tame ride for anyone who has watched John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" or Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Amazingly, the film was banned for ""excessive horror"" in Sweden until 1972.

""Nosferatu"" remains an oddity, a film any serious horror aficionado should watch in order to understand the origins of the genre. The film's greatest impact may have been in bringing the world the concept of sunlight killing vampires. ""Nosferatu"" is the source material for that bit of legend.

Watch it, but don't expect too much. The hype and the legend around ""Nosferatu"" are much better than the actual film.

Supplementing the digitalized film is an hour-long documentary on the making of ""Nosferatu,"" as well as clips from director F.W. Murnau's other films.  All in all, Ausgeseichnet!

""Nosferatu"" really is an amazing film (and I say this as someone not particularly fond of the vampire genre).  Murnau's expressionist cinematography creates an eeriness that's never been matched.  The long, lean Count Orlok (Max Schreck), his fingers unnaturally talon-like, arms stiffly at his side like a corpse's, eyes wide open but somehow dead, can frighten even modern audiences who've been trained by special effects artists to demand much from spooky movies.  The shipboard scene of Nosferatu rising from his coffin is uncanny.  Murnau also speeds up the camera when he films Nosferatu in motion, thereby suggesting that what the viewer is seeing is unnatural, other-worldly.

For the most part, Gustav von Wangenheim's Hutter (parallel to Stoker's Jonathan Harker) is competent, although there are a few of those overdone melodramatic moments one associates with silent film.  At one point, for example, Hutter slams a book about vampires on the floor to express his amused contempt for such superstitions.  But the scene is so over-acted that it comes across as more funny than anything else.  Greta Schroeder's Ellen (Stoker's Lucy) is a flop.  Schroeder seems incapable of not overacting in the grand style of silent movie queens satirized in ""Sunset Boulevard.""  Alexander Granach's Knock (Stoker's Renfield) is, in my judgment, the real star of the film.  Granach perfectly captures the creepy madness of Knock/Renfield.  His performance is stellar.

The libidinal tension implicit in all vampire stories also comes through in ""Nosferatu.""  In one scene in which Nosferatu is preying on Ellen, she cups one of her breasts and Nosferatu's shadow cups the other.  A gripping, masterful image, and one that's not been bested by the thousand and one Dracula re-makes since ""Nosferatu.""",1214784000,,2196,5.368421052631579
1780008,5,B00006JDSI,"This is of the double Kino DVD. There are a few improvements in this edition, making it worth getting, particularly as you can find it reasonably priced. First the improvement of the frames per second makes the acting more realistic and modern if still more than touched by Wagnerian over-emoting. Note: there are tiny frame displacements that in this digital computer age could easily be fixed by fabricating the tiny image loss between the two surrounding frames and it is hoped in the future Kino, Criterion and other labels will stop being reticent to do this. Creating the missing frames in such things as Harpo Marx's run across a couch with an ice block in one of their Paramount comedies will benefit from this too. It's no different than removing noise from the soundtrack or dirt from the print.

The images are almost pristine, and the tinting lovely. There are a few sequences that should be tinted and either Murnau neglected to do them or the surviving materials are missing them - for instance Orloc crosses to his house in full daylight carrying his coffin of dirt. Obviously Orloc dies in the morning sunlight later, so this sequence should be tinted blue for night. It would be no crime to fix this. Ditto when Orloc dies, there is no tinting as the sun hits him, yet when the film cuts back to the dying woman the room is tinted gold. It seems obvious this is some kind of technical oversight at the time. Preserving such an error isn't film scholarship, it's stuffy academy-itis, like the insistence that Shakespeare's son's name was Hamnet (not Hamlet) though it's certainly just poor penmanship by the local Stratford official.

The music is by far the best of the many film soundtracks over the years, most of which are too clever, too modern, or contemptuous of the original film, treating it as camp. This is just right, a reconstruction of the original classical score, deeply romantic and gothic, Wagner Lite. ""Nosferatu"" is a love story, in fact two love stories that intersect tragically. This score completely expresses that. The complaints about it are inexplicable to me. If you want a jagged atonal score, buy Kino's previous issue. This version is what Murnau obviously intended musically.

Murnau and Gance and Cocteau are the great surreal artists of the cinema, and no one has touched them via modern computer work to date; Tim Burton should study Murnau for a couple of years before he tries to make another film, his ""Sweeney Todd"" was childish compared to this. Given the technical limitations he had to deal with of the period, Murnau may have been the greatest of all, though Gance was more innovative. This is the edition for anyone who hasn't seen this film before, or anyone who has seen it many times and loves it. There will be a better issue in some decade to come, but it will be built on this. The German disk is actually unnecessary, but probably allows Kino to pay for the issue by charging for a double disk; given the results they are entitled.

PS If you want to dig deep enough, there are anti-Semitic and homophobic strains in the depiction of the title character - the anti-Semitic patina remarked upon when the 1922 actor's name was used for the villain in the Tim Burton Batman film - but frankly there are very few horror films then or now that don't in some way. It's certainly less homophobic than ""Silence of the Lambs"".",1212796800,,3384,4.711148648648648

1780011,4,B00006JDSI,"""The Bremen Incident"" proved a touchstone in Nazi History. Moored in New York harbor in 1933 the German Cruise Ship The Bremen flew both the Traditional National flag of Germany as well as the flag of the newly elected Nazi administration; the centerpiece of the Nazi flag being the ancient occultic symbol The Swastika. Angered by Hitler's anti-Semitism a mob of communists and Jewish intellectuals stormed the ship and destroyed the crimson, white and twisted black flag. In the aftermath of ""The Bremen Incident"", Hitler rallied the country to adopt the Swastika as the national symbol of a united Germany. The Nazi Party flag, with its occult symbol in the center of an iris-like circle became the sole image of the German people.

""When your candle burns low, you've got to believe that the last light shows you something besides the progress of darkness""
Blanche DuBois in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Tennessee Williams

Dirge-like, deliberate, ominous and foreboding- a harbinger of impending doom, the vampire Count Orlock marches up the cobblestone streets of Bremen carrying his coffin. Director FW Murnau's 1922 occult masterpiece NOSFERATU uses the medium of film to capture the steady dark progress of not only a plague, but also eerily foreshadow the destructive rise of the German Nationalist Socialist Party. As Count Orlock transforms the bright and sunny sea harbor of Bremen-Town into a funeral procession of endless black coated shadows, so would Hitler leave Germany (and Western Europe) as a rubble strewn corpse, cloaked in darkness.

Murnau communicates this steady progress of darkness through a wide variety of film techniques, perhaps none more so than the iris wipe. As a transition device the iris wipe brings either light to a darkening screen or dark to a bright screen. Like the candle illuminating only a small circle of light so does the iris wipe photograph (the word itself meaning ""light writing"") a limited image. During the iris wipe, the central image-lit in a circle (like the iris of an eye) may be lit while the rest of the screen vibrates with progressing darkness. The darkness continues to advance on the circle of light until in completely swallows the image.

While Murnau does employ the lapse dissolve to bridge his sequences and scenes, the iris wipe dominates. This re-enforces the theme coursing throughout the film- the steady progress of invited evil methodically poisoning a healthy organism.

Count Orlock communicating to his disciple, the real-estate agent Knock through occultic ancient Sanskrit and Celtic-derived runes asks to purchase an abandoned estate adjacent to the unwitting Hutter and his virgin fianc Ellen. The legal purchasing of property represents an invitation. Orlock does not invade in a blitzkrieg of dark force. He infects methodically. He is a dark disease descending upon and devouring the forces of light (the dressed in white and pure of heart and body Ellen). The iris wipe serves as visual metaphor for Orlock's power.

Like both the vampire and the steady iris-wipe, Hitler's diseased message of hate descended upon Germany and the world laden with occultic symbols. Legally elected to office, and frequently invited to ""annex"" unwitting neighboring nations, Hitler poisoned and plundered; fed off the riches of the land, the people and the culture-leaving a wake of cemeteries, rubble and black smoke.

Perhaps Murnau's off-screen interest in the occult and prophecy yielded a means of divining the future for Germany; perhaps not. Regardless, his eerie 1922 horror film NOSFERATU through its use of staging and film transitions foreshadows the blight of Nazism and the progression of darkness it cast over the light of the world.",1205452800,,3779,5.215815485996705

1780023,5,B00006JDSI,"-This review pertains to Nosferatu: The Ultimate DVD Edition-

In 1922, German director&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau/dp/B0000DZTUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau</a>&nbsp;released his film Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie des Grauens (in English this title translates to Nosferatu - A Symphony of Horror), which not only brought the thirty-three year old director into prominence among Germany's greatest filmmakers, but also gave the world what is perhaps the greatest horror film ever made.
Loosely based upon Bram Stoker's 1897 novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/0743498038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>, the screenplay was written by Henrik Galeen. However, either Murnau and the other filmmakers didn't understand the complexities of copyright law or they simply didn't bother to get legal permission to adapt Stoker's novel into a motion picture. In vain they tried to avoid having legal action taken against them by changing the names of the characters from the novel.
The film's shoot, which commenced early in July of 1921, took Murnau, his cast and crew across Germany. Nosferatu was released through independent production studio, Prana-Film, which was a German studio founded by Albin Grau, a noted producer, artist, and occultist. It was Albin Grau who first suggested Bram Stoker's gothic horror novel as a potential film project for the foundling studio. Other than Murnau, it was Grau who was responsible for the eerie, expressionistic atmosphere of Nosferatu, as he was not only the film's producer but also the costume designer, set designer, and artistic director.
The film would finally be released on March 4 of 1922 and despite an extensive marketing campaign and great critical acclaim, the film was only a modest commercial success. Bram Stoker's widow felt that the film too closely resembled her late husband's book, so as a result she sued Murnau and the film's small studio, Prana-Film. She had the courts order the film to be pulled from theatres and worse, she demanded that all prints of the film were to be destroyed. Thankfully some copies survived destruction or else we should not be able to view Murnau's penultimate masterpiece today.
Nosferatu featured a talented cast, which was headed by intense character actor Max Schreck, whose name literally translates to ""maximum terror"". Schreck played the vampire Count Orlok, not as a sex symbol or a handsome yet violent monster, but rather as a vile rat-like being that felt no human emotions; only a parasitic bloodlust. The rest of the cast included Gustav Von Wangenheim as Hutter, Alexander Granach as Knock, Greta Schroeder as Ellen, and John Gottowt as Professor Bulwer.

The story begins in 1838, when young Hutter is sent to Transylvania by the sinister estate broker Knock, where he is to deliver documents to Count Orlok. Once there he encounters many strange things and the mysterious Count reveals himself to be a vampire. The Count finds a picture of Hutter's young innocent wife, Ellen and then journeys to Wisborg, Germany to find her. Hutter is left behind in the vampire's eerie castle until one night when he manages to escape. By the time Hutter returns to his own home in Wisborg, the Count has spread a plague across the countryside. Too weak to battle this nefarious monstrosity, Hutter unknowingly leaves Ellen vulnerable to Orlok's attack. But Ellen, having read Hutter's journal and a book about Nosferatu, prepares to destroy the Count the only way she can. She plans to sacrifice herself to the undead Count and in so doing distract him until the sun rises since the first rays of the morning sun are lethal to the Nosferatu. In the final climactic scene Count Orlok creeps into their home and feeds on the virginal heroine's blood and then he meets his demise. Ellen's self-sacrifice and her defeat of Count Orlok lifts the accursed plague from Wisborg forever.

As a fan of both German expressionist films from the silent age and of the Dracula theme, this film has become my all-time favorite film. When I heard that Kino International was going to rerelease the film in a 2-disc Ultimate DVD Edition, I was thrilled. Having now seen the restoration, I must say that I am in awe. The quality of the transfer is greater than that found in any other available version. In fact I almost felt as if I were one of those lucky people who viewed this masterpiece during its original release.
There have been many, many releases of Nosferatu on DVD, and most of these are put out by small distribution companies. These DVD versions are typically of a very poor quality and as such are available at low prices. However there have been two prestigious distribution companies, Image Entertainment and Kino International (formerly Kino on Video), which have created high quality transfers of the film. For the latest and most impressive release, Kino International has united with Transit Film and the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung (translates to Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation). Utilizing the highest quality prints of the film available, they have to the best of their ability duplicated the look and sound of the film as it was shown in theatres in 1922. And for the first time ever, the film features the original score as composed by Hans Erdmann.
This 2-disc Ultimate DVD Edition includes the gloriously restored film in two versions; one with newly translated English intertitles and the other in German. This excellent DVD also includes The Language of Shadows: Murnau- The Early Years and Nosferatu documentary, which explores Murnau's early career and his connection with the occult, archival excerpts of eight other Murnau films, Nosferatu: An Historic Film Meets Digital Restoration featurette, an image gallery, and a scene comparison that examines the similarities and differences between Stoker's novel, Henrik Galeen's screenplay, and the final film. Overall this set is spectacular, but where some may be disappointed is with the content on disc two, which only contains the film with the original German intertitles. Kino could have at least included a commentary track or an alternate score. But unfortunately this was not to be the case. Now, all said the film restoration is fantastic and the special features on disc one are great which earns the Ultimate DVD Edition 5 stars, though I wish that disc two had been more elaborate in its content. Any minor complaints aside, this DVD makes a perfect gift for cineastes and horror fans alike.

1780027,4,B00006JDSI,"I've been watching Nosferatu for years, not because I enjoyed it, but because I at least respected parts of it.  Certain scenes and effects were breathtaking, even while the rest just felt laughable.  Having just seen the Kino restoration for the first time, I'm amazed to discover this is actually a very solid and enjoyable film.  Minor, but important changes, like using the correct projector speed, bring the tone and flow of this film to life in ways that had previously been left uncovered.  Moments in the film that previously felt unrelated and unjustified now earn their place, characterization and motivation come into focus more clearly, and the whole film achieves a new level of creepiness.  It's time to chuck out your $10 bargain copy of Nosferatu and make an investment in excellence.

Here are the strengths of this 2002 edition:

1. Correct projection speed.  This makes all the difference in the film, particularly in those early scenes that set up everything that follows.  Harker/Hutter is as hammy and over-played as ever, but instead of appearing so frantic as to make the entire film feel annoying, this Harker/Hutter, played at lower speeds, just makes you resent him enough to enjoy watching him come face to face with the Max Schreck vampire.  His manic performance no longer seems so comical as to ruin the tone of an otherwise morbid film.

2. New title cards.  The narrative vehicle for this entire film is a book whose pages are nearly impossible to read in the old editions.  Kino has completely redone these pages, making them clear as day.

3. Tinting.  Nosferatu often depends upon the viewer knowing when it is nighttime and when it is day, but the intense lighting of the 1920s often makes this impossible to discern.  Color tinting in this edition makes the difference quite obvious.

4. Soundtrack.  As with most silent films, the cheaper editions of Nosferatu pair the images with seemingly unrelated and often highly inappropriate music.  This new soundtrack, while a bit too experimental for my taste, conveys the emotional tone of this film quite well.

5. Previously missing scenes.  I felt like I saw many parts of this film  (particularly after Act 3) for the first time.  In previous editions, the additions of these scenes may have worked only to make the film seem more tedious, but I'm glad to see them included here.  They do strengthen the momentum of the film.

Put all of this together, and you get a previously broken film that now works seamlessly.  The story is still limited in some ways, particularly with the doctor's ambiguous role in the story and a mostly unimpressive climax, but the film holds together well, and it held my interest, too.  For the first time, after watching this film for ten years, I actually enjoyed it.

A few words of caution to those planning to buy this film, though.  I would hesitate to call this any kind of ""definitive edition.""  Kino does tamper with this film in several ways.

1. The soundtrack is very experimental.  It avoids dating itself with ""modern"" sounding music (like Giorgio Moroder's edition of Metropolis), but it does use sound effects and, on at least two occasions, voice, in addition to a wide array of instruments.  While all of this works, it clearly does not reflect the artistic intentions of the director.

2. I'm not convinced the title cards are translated faithfully.  Certain lines, like the captain of the ship saying ""I'm going below deck.  If I'm not back in 10 minutes..."" feel disingenuous and, perhaps, too modern for the film.

3. While the picture is clearer than in other editions, it still suffers from graininess and scratches.  It doesn't capture the ""newness"" that the film originally had in the same way that, for example, Kino's Metropolis restoration has.  You won't feel like you're watching this film in the same vibrant way that it was experienced by audiences in 1922.  It would have been nice if they could have somehow corrected for the film's sluggish shutter speed, as well.

For all of these reasons, it might make more sense to check out Kino's newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000VUQ4HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Edition</a>&nbsp;of Nosferatu (2007), which appears to be more faithful to the original work.

1780028,5,B00006JDSI,"I first saw NOSFERATU in an edited version on an old TV show hosted by the late William K. Everson called SILENTS, PLEASE! back in the early 1960s.  I was then a youngster, and the silent nightmarish images terrified me.  NOSFERATU has always been a much better cinematic treatment of DRACULA than the Tod Browning version.  And yet. . . the image quality in the best available prints, videotapes and even recent dvds has always been lacking.  Murnau was still a young director when he made NOSFERATU, and the budget for this movie was modest compared to those for his later work.  The direction of the actors seemed as lacking as the budget: melodrama and exaggerated pantomime is all too characteristic of stilted acting in bad silent films.  In NOSFERATU, the actors who play Hutter, Ellen & Knock display the worst excesses of Grand Style acting, in evident contrast to the genius of composition, lighting, camera movement and editing rhythms in the film which already prefigure Murnau's fully developed visual style.  Only Max Schreck as Count Orlok transcended the limitations of hammy acting and poor print quality, and turned in a bravura performance whose creepiness was possibly enhanced by the ghostly effects of fuzzy heightened contrast in poorly duped prints.  When I looked at the old Kino NOSFERATU a few years back with a group of friends, we all felt the film was thrilling, but the acting--- simply laughable.

Yesterday I got NOSFERATU (Ultimate Edition) and the restoration impressed me quite as much as the restoration done on Lang's METROPOLIS a few years ago.  The picture quality is astonishing, and the restoration of proper film speed with the vivid pallor of the images has proved to me I was wrong about much of the acting. The subtleties in performance were the first things to be lost in inferior prints projected at incorrect speed.  Hutter, Ellen and even over-the-top Knock turn in more finely-tuned melodramatic performances than I had believed was the case.  The famous shot of Orlok standing in the window of his deserted house, gazing towards Ellen's bedroom, now reveals a ghoulish face in the thrall of frustrated erotic longing as well as bloodthirsty intent.  The other amazing thing about this restoration is the quality of the ""nature"" shots: frightened horses bolting from a hyena; the phantom play of light against the spray of the waves as Ellen sits on the beach, the astonishing clarity of the establishing shot of Wisborg, even the close-up of the Venus Fly-Trap seizing a fly in its interlocking leaves, all are now seen in a way not possible for anyone to see since the film's release in the 1920s--- before the suit brought by Bram Stoker's widow caused much of the original film material to be destroyed. The music, adapted from the original score, works quite effectively and is frightening at all the propeer moments.  If you love the Dracula legend, NOSFERATU is the best, and these DVDs are by far the best version of NOSFERATU.  If you admire F.W. Murnau's work, this set is a must-have.  Two mosquito bites up for one of the best stocking stuffers of this holiday season!",1197417600,,3131,4.890359168241966
1780029,5,B00006JDSI,"While not exactly the very first vampire film ever made, this 1922 silent horror classic definitely made the mould and set the standard for all vampire and horror movies to follow.  Loosely based on the famous Dracula novel by Bram Stoker, ""Nosferatu"" has all the elements of the classic horror genre together with style and intelligence which are often sadly lacking in modern horror movies.  Famous German director F.W. Murnau and his colleagues changed the names and places from the Stoker novel to suit German audiences, but the essence of the story remains the same:  a sinister Count in an eerie castle in Transylvania bites necks to feed on his victim's blood during the night and sleeps in his coffin during daylight hours.  On a relatively small budget, Murnau managed to capture the creepiness of both the Count and his castle, and with just some grotesque make-up and long fake fingernails, actor Max Schreck successfully creates the dreadful horror of the supernatural vampire with his stance and slow, determined movements and gestures.  Every scene with Schreck is gripping and quite unforgettable, and it is easy to see why ""Nosferatu"" has gone down in history as a classic silent film and masterpiece of the genre.  As such, it is appropriate that Kino Video has put together this ultimate DVD edition with many extra features, but above all, this is a newly restored version taken from various sources to present the best possible picture quality, together with the orchestral score which was originally written for the film.  I thought my first DVD of ""Nosferatu"" on the Eureka label was a good print, but I was impressed to see how clear and fresh this digitally restored picture looks, and together with beautiful classical music, ""Nosferatu"" has risen to new heights as a stylish and classic film.

For the more serious enthusiast, the 1-hour documentary on F.W. Murnau which focuses on the making of ""Nosferatu"" is particularly interesting as it carefully traces the steps taken by Murnau and his crew, going to the various locations where filming took place.  I was surprised and fascinated to see that many buildings and even the eerie castle seen in the film still exist today, some hardly changed in 85 years.  And for the real purists or Germans, the second disc in this set has all the original German intertitles to give us a good idea of how German audiences first experienced ""Nosferatu"" at its release in 1922. With all this additional background information, as well as interesting stills and artwork for the film and excerpts from other Murnau films, this set is invaluable for not only silent film collectors, but also for fans of the horror genre and Dracula and vampire stories in particular.",1197331200,,2729,4.951859956236324
1780030,4,B00006JDSI,"This is the best we have seen NOSFERATU yet. Beautiful restoration, something like the original Hans Erdmann score--if cut-and-pasted and mixed with familiar classical themes (a little distracting), the most complete print, and more frame information than before (in most places). Yet it's still not as ""ultimate"" as it could be.

First of all, it is not, as expected, a direct PAL-to-NTSC conversion of the UK Eureka ""Masters of Cinema"" version--both a good thing (very little digital artifacting unlike some other Kino releases) and a less good one as it turns out. Kino has obviously reprocessed it, and not always for the better. On the plus side, for whatever reason, the Kino version is a bit sharper than the Eureka. On the minus side: [1] The basic tint shade of the original restoration, as seen on the Eureka PAL disc, is a yellowish sepia with noticeable warm orange in it; Kino's basic shade is much yellower, sometimes annoyingly glary. [2] The original German restoration on the Eureka PAL disc has considerably more edge information on all four sides than all earlier versions. Kino generally has more than earlier versions too, but compared with the Eureka release, the top and bottom have a sliver less info and noticeably less on the sides. What would have been so bad about window-boxing the film so we could finally see the whole frame as intended?

Kino has done something very odd: they give us the film twice--once on the main disc with newly created English inter-titles, and alone on a second disc with the original German inter-titles and optional English subtitles. Since the second disc is the more accurate way to do it--and the only way in the Eureka set, why bother with the translated-title-card version--especially when the font doesn't match the original very well? There didn't need to be any more than one disc: the original German inter-titles are far preferable and do have optional English subs.

The documentary--originally in German--is nice, but the new Amerian narrator misprounces some things repeatedly. The Eureka edition has a commentary track; Kino does not. Kino, instead, ports over the same old extras from its 2002 DVD. Come to think of it, given that the Eureka set only has the German inter-titled version with optional English subs and the documentary (as well as a 3-minute ""how we did it"" feature common to both), neither it nor the Kino needed to be 2-disc sets! These are best versions so far, as I said, but some questionable decisions make another one probable--and sad to say, perhaps desirable--down the road, at least in the US. Maybe that was the idea: keep the buyer coming back to spend for yet another ""new improved"" version.",1196380800,,2693,4.940397350993377

1780046,5,B00006JDSI,"F.W. Murnau's silent-era adaptation of Dracula was the first movie version of Bram Stoker's classic tale; unfortunately, it was unauthorized, and Stoker's widow successfully sued to wipe NOSFERATU from the face of the earth.  But vampires are hard to put down, and in true Dracula fashion NOSFERATU rose from the grave to assert its rightful station amidst the classics of cinema.  Decades later, NOSFERATU continues to entertain and frighten lovers of classic cinema everywhere.  Even today, after dozens of Dracula adaptations ranging from the excellent to the ridiculous, including a famous but disappointing remake from Werner Herzog, NOSFERATU remains one the three greatest Dracula films ever produced, rivalled only by Universal's DRACULA (featuring Bela Lugosi) and Hammer Film's HORROR OF DRACULA (starring Christopher Lee).  And lest we forget, NOSFERATU was the inspiration for the critically acclaimed SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, a fine movie in its own right.

What makes NOSFERATU so great?  Above all else, it's hard not mention Max Schreck's unearthly performance as the eponymous vampire, Dracula himself.  Schreck's Dracula is no urbane playboy; rather, a ghastly goblin who remorselessly preys upon the young and brings the plague with him.  Schreck's bald, ratlike visage grows ever more monstrous as the story progresses, and if it cannot necessarily be said that his intepretation of Dracula is actually better than Lugosi's or Lee's, it is certainly scarier--indeed, Schreck's Dracula is the most truly terrifying vampire of them all, and for that matter much more like the depictions of vampires in traditional folklore.  Greta Schroeder likewise brings a full-blooded heroine to life in her portrayal of the benighted Nina, whose innate righteousness and love for her husband give her the strength to make the ultimate sacrifice.  But Murnau's personal vision and directorial flair cannot be ignored--the cinematography is oustanding, even by modern standards, and Murnau's shots of fay-haunted woodlands, sweeping mountaintops and gothic castles are both beautiful and eerie.  Murnau creates a waking nightmare, one which is brought to a head in one of the most powerful climaxes in cinema.

What a shame that most contemporary movie lovers--particularly horror fans--won't give a film from the silent era a chance.  Doubtless Herzog's color-and-sound version from the 1970s is more likely what a modern movie-lover would choose to watch, simply becase it's newer.  But make no mistake:  Murnau's original is superior in every way.

NOTE:  This review is for the Alpha Video DVD.  Though DVD's from Alpha are of variable quality, NOSFERATU is of generally good video quality, at least for a film that is so old, except for a few frames near the end (thankfully after the climax) which momentarily freeze up.",1192752000,,2828,5.403189066059226
1780047,5,B00006JDSI,"Now that it has been officially released in the U.S., there are no more ifs ands or buts. This edition of NOSFERATU is truly the ultimate restoration. If you want a sneek peak at how the film will look and sound go to the Kino International website and check it out. There is a three minute excerpt that shows how the restoration was done with before and after results. There is also a full length documentary as well as a first time recording of the 1921 Hans Erdmann score putting this edition of NOSFERATU in league with the work done on METROPOLIS and BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.

NOSFERATU is one of the true landmarks of German silent cinema as well as the horror film itself. It has always been around in inferior copies from 16mm prints for years which attests to the film's importance but only recently have we been able to see it in something close to what Murnau intended. There are a few good versions out there now but be prepared to be blown away by this one. Proper colorization, correct film speed (18 frames per second), and the original orchestral score make this head and shoulders above the rest. And that's just the film!

Also included in this 2 disc set are a wealth of extras including the original German intertitles and excerpts from other Murnau films. Even non-silent film enthusiasts will want to get this one so order your copy now. For those of you who don't know, this is the original Dracula film and there has never been another one quite like it although Werner Herzog directed a 1979 remake with Klaus Kinski.

1780049,5,B00006JDSI,"The German silent film classic ""Nosferatu"" was nearly lost to history less than three years after its release in 1922.  The movie follows the exact same plot as all other adaptations of Bram Stokers ""Dracula"", so I won't continue with a review of an already well known story.  The film itself has a history that is every bit as interesting as the movie's storyline.  The film's director F.W. Murnau, had applied for the rights to the book, as well as the play adaptation, so he could make them into a movie. While waiting for the rights to be accquired, Murnau went ahead with production, changing character names and locations, in the hope that this would get him around the copyright laws. He seemed to know that the rights would never be his, and on a shoestring budget, he rushed from one hugh outdoor set to the next, to complete his masterpiece. Bram Stoker's widow, Florence sued the movie's studio Prana-Film, and won her case.  The studio in turn filed bankruptcy, and the film dissappeared from the publics view shortly after its release.  Florence Stoker eventually decided to have the court produce an order for the films destruction, which they did, that order included every known copy in existence.  However, then, as today, you had people who made pirated copies of the film to keep as their own.  And that is the reason this film exists today.  It was a movie ordered destroyed because it had pirated its own storyline, but in the end, was saved for later generations by piracy of the movie itself.  A true paradox in film history.

The title character is played by a then unknown German actor named Max Schreck, and together with Murnau, they created the most terrifying vampire ever brought to the screen.  Nothing in film, has come even remotely close to Schreck's Count Orlok for outright repugnance.  Unquestionably, the character remains the ugliest vampire ever created.  More animal like than human, Schreck had an overly large, mostly bald head, with pointed ears and a large hooked nose.  His hands had extremely long, talon like fingers, that one could actually envision him using while on his unending quest for blood.  Fittingly, Schreck's Count was also as pale and skinny as a corpse, a fact which seemed to be at odds with the remarkable, and seemingly effortless feats of strength he was capable of performing.  For example, he carries a full sized, dirt filled, wooden coffin from the London docks all the way to his newly accquired home, under one arm, like anyone else might carry a small suitcase.  The films other characters almost seem needless once Schreck appears on the screen, in fact, they appear as nothing more than targets of the vampires blood lust, as he travels from his Carpathian home to London. Of course, in the end, good triumphs over evil, and the vampire is killed through a selfless act of love.

Had the film not been kept from the public's view for so long, Schreck would have been a well remembered star in his day, and Murnau would have gotten the recognition he deserved for this film, as it was quite an accomplishment for its time.  But that is something he would never see, since he was killed at the age of 43, in a car crash in 1929, only seven years after completing ""Nosferatu"".  Despite all of this, it appears as if his film, like vampires themselves, will have a long and undying history that is already rich in little known details.  It remains one of the best silent films ever made; and it will continue to stand on it's own merits, against the test of time.",1190419200,,3535,4.696920583468396

What a creepy vampire movie!  There are some scenes that could have come from my nightmares.

The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.

1780060,5,B00006JDSI,"That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is  quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard.

The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the [..] crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ?

The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people.

The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations.

The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.

While I welcome remake technology and enjoy it's new dimension, without a baseline knowledge of the original context, it's like trying to understand Shakespeare by only reading the Cliffs Notes.

What saves this release is the excellent commentary track, the `then and now' comparisons which beautifully highlight poignant scenes to how they look and exist today (example: opening scene of Wismar city center in 1922 and present day), and the still gallery which provides even more material for the movie and history buff.",1153699200,,939,5.295302013422819
1780066,4,B00006JDSI,"The grand-daddy of all vampire movies - there may be earlier ones, but Murnau's 1922 NOSFERATU is the one we all remember - is still pretty effective.  Count Orlok (Max Schreck) wants to buy a house in Bremen, the nave and ambitious real estate agent Hutter travels to his gloomy castle to do the deal.  While there Hutter spills a little blood (those red marks on his neck aren't, as he believes, from the pesky mosquitoes) and, worse, he drops a cameo portrait of his `pure' wife Ellen (`nice neck') under the, er, robust nose of the contract-signing Count.

 If you've seen any vampire movie made since then, and there are thousands of them, you can pretty much connect the dots from the set-up to the end. NOSFERATU is the least frightening, yet most disturbing, movie I've seen.  Set against deserted and barren landscapes of cragged castles and enveloping arches, populated by characters who flow from one extreme pose to another, shadowed by Freudian debris from the blistered imagination of Bram Stoker, framed and focused through the Expressionist lens of German director F.W. Murnau, NOSFERATU is a filmed nightmare.  By today's standards the acting is broadly melodramatic and resoundingly bad, ham upon ham.  Orlok, the Dracula character, is a taloned and pointy-toothed grotesque.  Poor Hutter is a bouncing halfwit. Nobody and nothing reflects reality in this picture, at least waking reality.

 To be honest, NOSFERATU didn't begin to work on me right away.  I saw it years ago on a bad vhs tape and wasn't very impressed.  The Image print is clean, has many delicately tinted sequences (original, I believe) and a good commentary track.  Still, after the first viewing I had something close to my original reaction.  I watched it a couple other times after that, once with the commentary track, and found the acting increasingly less distracting and the images more insinuating and disturbing.

On the down side, yes, they can't make up their minds whether it is Dracula or Orlock, and there are other things that are rather disturbing from an authenticity standpoint. To me, there is no excuse for not using the original names and places and so forth - tinting as well, to get as close to Murnau's original film as possible. Had they placed this music with a more faithful rendition of the film, I would be 100% happy because I think the music is a great fit for Nosferatu.",1149724800,,605,4.315789473684211

I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror or has an interest/appreciation for good film. Though it is old, it is very well done for it's time. Nosferatu beats any new age 'dracula' story, it doesn't focus on fashion nor trend. It simply is what it is.",1142899200,,381,4.617647058823529
1780077,5,B00006JDSI,"There's an art to it, definitely, the whole business of frightening the audience. I'm no fan of slash-gash-scream-gore type films, but when the terror is part of a tapestry most delicately woven, a piece that is subtle and blatant, a love story and a horror story, a gripping and shocking piece where the opening of a door becomes a  moment of nail-biting tension... then it's not a slash-film but a film of art.

""Nosferatu"" has been described as the greatest horror film of all time. I cannot disagree - Murnau's remarkable use of double-negatives and his various lighting techniques impart such a wonderful sense of the macabre to this film. The acting varies - the young estate agent is no Olivier, but oh mon Dieu... oh, Max Schreck... what a superb performance his Graf Orlock is.

It's the creepiest performance of a vampire that has ever been seen. The makeup is wonderful - the atmosphere is wonderful - the truly frightening creature who is almost uncontrollable at the sight of fresh blood is wonderful in a grisly sense.

This is a film not to be missed. Whether you are a fan of the horror genre or not, Nosferatu is a classic in film-making.",1142121600,,1155,4.674876847290641

Shrek plays the vampire as a man suffering from an illness instead of a flamboyant caped playboy. With his bat-like ears and rat-like fangs, he seems more animal than human. I didn't find the movie scary, but it is haunting. This DVD has excellent bonus features like two music scores, an audio essay commentary and lots of production stills as well as photos of Expressionist art that influenced Murnau's dark vision, like paintings by Edward Munch, Adolph Menzel, Franz Mare and Casper David Friedrich. There are even current photographs of the many of the actual locations that were used in the film in case you feel like taking your own Nosferatu tour. A classic masterpiece that stands on it's own and still has the power to disturb.

I read that some don't like it alot because of the music score. I don't think that should have a real bearing on the the film. It is a silent film, your lucky you even have some music!

Max Schreck's performance of Count Graf Orlok is still one of the most haunting performances today. And his makeup is still one of the best of all time.

This is the 1st Dracula movie ever made, too bad Stoker's wife wanted all the copies of this film destroyed. Good thing not all of them were. To me, this is better than Bela Lugosi's Dracula, for a silent film, Schreck's role as Orlok was more haunting and disturbing than Lugosi's Dracula.

1780082,4,B00006JDSI,"The accounts of the making of NOSFERATU are fascinating.  I had known of the film ever since my college days in the '70s but have never gotten a chance to see it until Halloween Eve of 2005.  I had seen some Murnau in film classes I took back in the day (SUNRISE and THE LAST LAUGH come to mind) and have always been curious about this ""original horror film,"" which many have described as the definitive DRACULA, despite the apparently cosmetic changes made since the Stoker estate refused Murnau the rights to the novel.

Undeterred Murnau proceeded to change names to protect those guilty of copyright violation and pretty much adhered to the outlines of the classic novel.  And in the felicitously (?) named Max Schreck, he pretty much found the personification of the Lord of the Undead.  The first time I ever saw a movie still from NOSFERATU, I was already creeped out beyond measure.  This was no vaguely comic Bela Lugosi figure.  This was the stuff nightmares are made of.  No cartoonized Nosferatu creature would ever grace an American cereal box...

Of course one grows more jaded and, one hopes, less easily spooked over time.  In the years since I first learned of NOSFERATU and actually getting around to seeing the legendary film, I've certainly sat through enough would-be shockers to find out that I'm no longer so easily shocked.  Another reviewer posted (apparently jokingly) a tale of how he got his five year old to watch NOSFERATU with him and  how she has been spooked ever since.  That would be disturbing were it true. We know how THE WIZARD OF OZ's flying monkeys and oversized talking heads can instill nightmares in a child of that age, and we can only imagine what this landmark of Expressionistic horror film would do to one so young.

Or for that matter, what it would do to an audience in 1922.  Even those of us who are not film historians (merely buffs or even casual fans) have a sense of how differently we perceive film in the 21st century than our forebears did 100 years ago (or a bit less).  We study a film like this as much as we experience it--perhaps moreso.  ""Ah yes, he's using slow motion here, speeding up the film there, and here's some early use of double exposure.""  By admiring the film and its place in history, we are able to distance ourselves from the horror elements.

1780083,4,B00006JDSI,"OK, my kids saw Van Helsing (dumb movie) at a sleepover last weekend and got into the whole Dracula thing so I sat down and did my research.  In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version.  Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!).  I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic.  Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times.  Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like ""Count Liberace"".  As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting.  I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and ""Freaks"" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the ""Nosferatu's"" are superior.  I'm gonna have to see every flick about ""Drac"" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.  The version with the ""Type O Negative"" soundtrack is also cool or just turn it down and lay down your own soundtrack!",1128988800,,1413,4.665322580645161
1780084,3,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu is one of the first two horror movies I ever bought.  I still have that videotape, with a soundtrack by Clubfoot Orchestra.

It's a great movie with some images that are still pretty haunting, if not quite scary, today.  The best DVDs in terms of image quality and extras for NTSC Region 1 are probably the ones by Kino and by Image.

As silent movie aficionados say, silent movies weren't really ""silent,"" having pretty much always been accompanied by an organist or small orchestra.  To this day there are still revivals of Nosferatu with live accompaniment, particularly around Halloween.

It can be interesting to listen to different musicians' ideas of what appropriate accompaniment might be.  Apart from the various videotape and DVD releases of Nosferatu, which usually feature some sort of original score (though occasionally with ""canned"" classical music haphazardly applied), a number of artists have recorded soundtracks for Nosferatu which they have released separately.  You would have to synchronize the audiocassette or CD with your videotape or film of the movie.  I remember seeing some reviewed and/or advertised in the music magazine Alternative Press.

The first version of it I had watched that had a gothic music soundtrack was the DVD Nosferatu: The First Vampire with music by Type O-Negative.  It's not bad.  I just watched this one, Nosferatu: A Gothic Industrial Mix (Nosferatu: A Tale of Gothic Horror as the opening titles have it) with ""music by Rozz Williams of Christian Death and Electric Hellfire Club.""  Again, not bad.  I'm not very familiar with gothic music.  Stylistically, it can vary pretty widely, sounding similar to rock, or techno, or heavy metal, etc.  The music for the ""Gothic Industrial Mix"" is more what I would describe as ambient.  Most of it is pretty relaxing music one could fall asleep to, if so inclined.  Though primarily instrumental, occasionally there are voices as either vocals or vocal samples.

Cleopatra Home Video did add opening and end titles to the movie.  The intertitles (aka title cards) are not theirs, but are from whatever print of the film they used.  Curiously, their opening titles give the actors' names beside the character names from the original German version (Count Orlok, Hutter, Knock, etc.).  However, the DVD rear box cover and the intertitles use the names of the characters from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, of which this was an unauthorized adaptation.  Those intertitles originate evidently with an American re-release of Nosferatu, but how long ago they were created, I'm not sure - but Cleopatra is not at fault for them.

The print of the film used is not bad, probably on par with other inexpensive public domain releases of the movie.  It features the usual faults, such as the top of Nosferatu's head being cropped off when he stands bolt upright in his coffin.

The DVD has no extras except for a chapter selection.  As with a number of DVDs whose menus feature only two options (""play movie"" and ""scene selection""), the selected option is a different color than the deselected one.  However, unless you know which color is the color used for highlighting, it's impossible to know which is selected!  In such cases, it's better to have an icon appear next to the selected option.",1128902400,,3290,5.018450184501845

It' s further exciting than the match, it' s even more captivating than love... I ask for phantasmagoric films, poetic films in the dense sense, philosophical of the word; physic films. What it doesn't exclude neither the psychology nor love, as well as the disjoint of any of the feelings of man. I want these films in which it operates a kind of  crushing, fusion, of blending of these things of the heart and spirit, to confer them the cinematographic virtue that all of us must seek.""

I keep for this movie a very special affection. I have watched so many times that it is has become an unavoidable confident as the sublime art.

The German Expressionism dressed its best clothes with this towering masterpiece pregnant of dark poetry and awesome beauty. Watching this film means to experiment similar feelings respect let' s say around the famous Sonnet 144 of Shakespeare.

In Nosferatu,  Murnau'  s vampire the fantastic accompanies us, empowers us  of a perfectly natural way. The beyond grayish grave described by Bram Stocker incorporates in front of us with all the power of a real vision.

Lotte Eisner states:"" ... Murnau knew discern in the nature the possibility of getting beauty images. He captures the fragile form of a white cloud floating above the dunes and fixes the filigree that the mass of branches design on a spring sky that invades the twilight. The nature shares in the whole drama...""

With the German Expressionism, spouted after the hecatomb that meant the WW1, the cinema disinters the ghosts that inhabited the Romanticism in Germany. Mysticism, magic, nostalgia of the shadows and reflects, delirious love for the fantastic allies with the lineaments of an intellectual rebellion and a cinematographic aesthetic.

In North America a name: Tod Browning will receive all the weight of the horror and the hopeless and will materialize it in ""Freaks.""

Ado Kyrou states those powerful and unbeatable words:""...I greet you, corps born from the imagination, friendly ectoplasms...Cesare (Robert Wiene 's Caligari) , the dolls of the devil and the Golem will murder their masters and Frankenstein, the monster will be more meritorious of our love than his shy creator. The fantastic birds will rend the screen and the final image, definitive in the mobility, free, will be a complete world, without Gods, but with circular doors where our unchained forces will whine the jubilee of the life and love in the wonderful""

1780088,5,B00006JDSI,"Nosferatu eine Symphonie des Grauens has always been one of my favorite movies.  I actually have two copies one on VHS and the other on DVD.  Of the two I prefer the music on the VHS, although it's rather churchy sounding, it seemed appropriate for the story.  Max Shreck was subtle in his performance and his appearance seemed to get more and more disturbing as the movie went on.  With most movies you get adjusted to the creature's features, not this one.  One thing I like about the movie is how it sticks in one's memory, and continues to bother one for days afterwards, because it's more visual than visceral.  The only special effect was Graff Orlock's disappearance in a puff of smoke at the conclusion.  Very few movies have this retention effect.  I've only had it from four other movies: Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Roman Polanski's Repulsion and Macbeth, and the Nicole Kidman's The Others.  Nosferatu stripped the book Dracula to the bone and almost succeeded in making a totally seperate vampire story.  Even Gustav von Wagenheim's exaggerrated performance seemed dead on, even when he was pulling the covers over his head and cowering.  The early lovey-dovey scenes with his wife Ellen were a little sticky sweet though. Greta Schroder was even more the Victorian Angel in the House than Mina in the novel Dracula.  The character in the novel showed a lot of backbone and thoughtfulness. Schroder's long-suffering demeanor did grow tiresome after awhile though.  A funny thing was that in some scenes Schroder's reminded me of Susan St. James.  Maybe that's why the latter was casted in Love At First Bite. I'm inclined to doubt it, although I understand that's why Roman Polanski casted himself in The Fearless Vampire Hunter's, because of his resembelance to von Waggenheim.  The shadows of the movie were interesting in portending doom, but now days I have to admit it makes me think of the Simpson's take-off of the mediocre Bram Stoker's Dracula.  The shadows of the vampire were contrary to Stoker's book, but perhaps not to all legends.

For example, in the 34th minute, commentator Lokke Heiss tells us that Murnau is playing the text against the visuals by having written ""Hutter had heard her [Ellen's] call of warning"" as the text. The intertitles however on this DVD though don't say this at this point; instead we read ""her soul had heard the call of the deathbird.""  So ... which is it?  Heiss was certainly watching a different version from this one when he did his commentary track.

Another drawback to this version is that the English text seems almost childish at times - with a language as rich in terror adjectives as English is, couldn't the translator do better than resorting several times to ""creepy?""

Nonetheless, Heiss's comments really are expert (but could anyone explain how, if vampires cannot cross moving water, the Count appears as a hyaena to check on Hutter at the inn across the river?).

These two films are the perfect reminders of how lighting and atmosphere can have an effect on the moviegoer without a whole lot of special effects. I guess I would have to say ""Nosferatu"" is my favorite of the two films because Max Schreck simply gave me the creeps as Nosferatu. Nosferatu was nothing like Dracula. He was not handsome or suave like Dracula was. Nosferatu was and is the scariest looking vampire I have ever seen. None of the vampires today matches the scariness of Max Schreck and this movie was made in 1929. What also makes ""Nosferatu"" work so well is the gestures of Max Schreck's character like the way Nosferatu would look at someone (or something) before his head would turn. Then there is in the boat when he rises up from his sleep and out of his coffin. For a time when there was no CGI or any sort of high tech special effects, that scene alone was pure magic. I still get a lot of joy watching that particular scene. The film may be grainy and with a minimal storyline but I don't mind. I think it is still one of the best vampire films out there today.

1780095,5,B00006JDSI,"Well, like thousands of frightened and astounded fans before me, Nosferatu impresses as a German-Expressionistic masterpiece.  Certainly it should be ranked in the best twenty films ever made. The date of this version is 1929, but in a recent film about the making of this first vampire movie, Shadow of the Vampire, 2000, they claim 1921, which seems to me from the sets, lady's make up, technology, and photography, that 1921 is the correct date.

The score of this release certainly is driving and enhancing.  The amazing death carriage scene done in reverse negative is unforgettable.  Max Schreck is a geeky, malformed vampire. He is so deformed that Shadow of the Vampire suggests that Max actually believed himself to be a vampire and that Murnau was willing to sacrifice actors and crew members to Max's cravings.  Yes, it's a funny idea, but trust me readers, after seeing Max's vampire, I'm not sure he doesn't dine on cast blood.

German Expressionism is the juxtaposition of cubic forms on everyday scenes to enhance an underlying dread.  This dread in Germany after WW1 expresses primitive fears of a society in a tailspin, starvation, poverty, a fear that God has forsaken you to the forces of evil.  Although Stoker's vampire is of the 19th century, it is difficult to tell whether we are watching rural Germany of the 19th or 20th Century.  F.W.

1780113,5,B00006JDSI,"One of the earliest and best horror films of our age. Nosferatu stars Max Shreck as the horrific vampire, Nosferatu, or Count Orlock. Every single time that the vampire walked into the room towards Harker, I felt compelled to hide under a table or a safe area!

 This is the story of a young townsman named Jonathan Harker, who is sent a business letter by a certain ""Orlock"", whom Harker simply knows as a rich count. So, Harker embarks on a long journey through mysterious mountainous, woodsy, and shrouded places to the count's ominous castle. The next events in this silent masterpiece are too terrifying to explain. The best horror film, beside Phantom of the Opera and Metropolis, ever made in our early history. Possibly even in our long century.

 Are we ready for some serious discussion? Can we talk? Unfortunately, countless bad prints, both VHS and DVD, have been made of Nosferatu. The Goodtimes Video release has grainy image quality, but is in the original black & white color format. It does not have a musical score.

 A tinted version by Type O Negative has pretty good image quality, but a distracting soundtrack.

 Blackhawk has produced a fairly credible DVD of this classic, with fuzzy image quality but a classical music score.

 Madacy has released an expensive DVD. The picture and sound quality also leave something to be desired.

 Yet another VHS print was duplicated by Timeless Video. I own a VHS version of Metropolis released by Timeless Video, and found it to be better than I expected, though the quality is shoddy compared to the Kino Video print.

 The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is the best on the market yet. The picture quality is fine, and the soundtrack is suitable.

 This old horror classic is guaranteed to send a chill up your spine. So purchase the Kino version today!",1091059200,,1809,4.768488745980707
1780114,5,B00006JDSI,"I recall seeing this film as a child, around the age of 9 or so, and being scared witless by Max Schreck's Count Orlok.  Schreck's vampyre still remains ultra creepy ~ those long, clawlike hands, those deepset eyes, those scraggly sharp teeth ~ and perhaps my favorite incarnation of the bloodsucking undead.  The photography of the Carpathian countryside is breathtaking, adding authentic atmosphere to the setting.  You are, actually, 'there'.  The special effects are also impressive for the time, and the tinting of the film, I believe, is original.  Many silent films were tinted: blue for night, red for danger, sepia or orange for bright day, green for other effects.  I make a plug for Greta Schroeder, who did an admirable job of pacing distractedly, filled with awful foreboding. I was quite satisified with the choice of soundtracks on the DVD, and my 17-year-old son had a blast switching between them as the mood struck.

1780115,1,B00006JDSI,"I suppose only those that like this movie will check the reviews. Mostly to read about how others like the movie as well as they do. But lord, what a boring movie this is. I don't care if it's a ""classic,"" I don't care how revered it is. Just because it's old and silent and the ""first"" movie about vampires/Dracula, does NOT mean that this is a good movie. I've seen plenty of silent movies, and it's true that most are boring, but some can be entertaining (I liked 1913's Cleopatra, for example). Nosferatu, on the other hand, is a bore. The mass of the story deals with people traveling, so you have tons of time wasted on someone walking, or riding a horse through vast landscapes, or having a ship drift through water. Walking and walking, riding, going places all the time - and never spending much time on the story when they actually GET THERE! It's such a terrible letdown. All this build up, and not much payoff. The director of this movie was obsessed with ""filler."" Filling time, wasting time, ""just keep walking."" Parts that were meant to be scary sometimes work. But barely. Count Orlock does look creepy (like a rat, or a bat creature, whatever...), and there are a few scenes of eerie looking shadows against walls. But that's about it. Sometimes Count Orlock looks silly, like when he's walking through town carrying a coffin as if it were light as cardboard (which it probably was). Worst of all, they took away the black and white of this movie by adding tints. So you get blues and greens and pinks. Horrible. Also, the music - well, enough people have complained about the music. It doesn't fit, especially near the beginning when it's just upbeat sounding and la-la-la happy silly and stupid. Grrr. I hated this movie. Glad I finally watched it, since it has such a reputation, but whew - what a pile. Don't buy into ""this is great because it's so old"" nonsense.

1780126,5,B00006JDSI,"Of course this is a haunting film, certainly on everyone's short list of the greatest silent films in history.  But which version to buy?
The Alpha Video DVD, like all of their silent DVDs, has an appallingly poor video transfer.  You can watch it, but you wouldn't want to if you didn't have to.  It seems like all of Alpha's old films are too dark on the left, and too bright on the right.  When a character wanders to the left of the screen, he disappears, when he goes to the right, he is almost washed out.  Intertitles can only be read clearly from the middle to the right margin.  All the figures are grainy, like you need to adjust the sharpness, but can't.  I could only recommend a Alpha Video silent DVD if absolutely no other option is available.  I am a cheap guy who loves a good deal, but I think Amazon should seriously consider whether or not to even sell their shoddy products.
The Image Entertainment has by far the best looking cover and artwork, as I find they do for most of their products (compare their cover for The Thief of Baghdad with Kino's).  But the soundtrack options are quite poor on Nosferatu, and are nearly as distracting to a proper enjoyment of the film as Alpha Video's terrible image quality.
The current winner for Nosferatu is certainly the Kino version.  The image quality equals the Image Entertainment version, but the music is much better.  Its not a long shot, however, as the cover art is inferior to Image's.  And I still agree with the reviewer who wrote that all of these versions are running too fast.  IMDB lists the running time as 94 minutes,  but all of three of these versions clock in just over 80 minutes (10% too fast?).",1086480000,,1681,4.468852459016394
1780127,5,B00006JDSI,"It always surprises me when I suddenly notice there are horror films I should have seen years ago but am only seeing for the first time now. F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic take on the vampire legend, ""Nosferatu"" is one of these films. What horror film fan would not take some time to watch this legendary creation? Well, me for one. I put it off for years due to my general dislike of the vampire sub genre. You can only take so many debonair duffers tooling around a castle sinking their fangs into the throats of girls before you give up in frustration. A few vampire films I like, such as ""Fright Night,"" but as a general rule I can leave them more often than I can take them. It only took a few minutes of ""Nosferatu"" to discover this film wasn't going to be the type of vampire film I am used to seeing. You won't see a Frank Langella or Christopher Lee type playing the lead bloodsucker in this disturbing movie. One look at the hideous visage on the DVD cover provides ample evidence that the vampire in this movie won't wow the ladies with his good looks or suave charm. The vampire in ""Nosferatu"" is exactly how a vampire should look.
Set in Germany back in the nineteenth century, ""Nosferatu"" tells the horrific tale of an entire town stricken by the evil machinations of the rat-like Count Orlok, a truly sinister figure both loathsome and repellent. After a real estate agent named Knock sells the count his property, he falls under the spell of its gruesome tenant. The agent wants Orlok to come to Bremen, so he sends his assistant Hutter out to the castle. Harker's virginal wife Ellen objects to the sudden departure of her husband, but knows he must fulfill the obligations of his job. The scenes involving the trip to Orlok's pad and Hutter's subsequent stay are masterpieces of ominous foreshadowing. Animals bolt in panic as the coach nears the castle, the villagers fall silent when Hutter mentions Orlok, and his driver adamantly refuses to take the assistant to the castle. The count sends his own coach, an unusual device that moves supernaturally thanks to Murnau's use of fast motion photography. Obviously, strange things are afoot even before the vampire goes on his rampage.
Hutter falls prey to Orlok during his stay at the castle, but manages to escape and head back to Bremen to warn the town. His wife, in the meantime, suffers strange dreams and hallucinations that foreshadow her own encounter with the vampire. Knock goes off his rocker, and is institutionalized at the local jail. As for Orlok, he boards a vessel and heads to Bremen and a meeting with Hutter's virgin bride. The scenes on the ship are masterfully chilly. The count hides in a coffin in the hold of the ship, rising to feast on the unwary sailors. His movements on the boat, often accompanied by dozens of rats, nauseates even as it fascinates the viewer. By the time the movie reached this point, I couldn't think of a horror film character more hideous or repulsive than Orlok. When the ship reaches port, doctors fear a plague has killed the crew. They are partially right. A plague has reached town, but one these doctors have never seen before. Before long, townspeople start to drop like flies as Orlok pounds the cobblestones at night looking for Hutter's wife. The conclusion to the film involves no stakes, no holy water or crucifixes, but a good old fashioned German girl using her purity to destroy evil. I'll leave it you to see how she does it.
""Nosferatu"" is a classic because a perceptive viewer can see so many themes in it. Is it a movie about sexuality, or Weimer politics, or a foreshadowing of the National Socialists? I'd like to promote a view of the movie I haven't seen yet (although it may be out there somewhere). I couldn't help but see a lot of potential anti-Semitic themes playing out in the movie. Orlok's physical presence resembles in no small way the depictions of Jews that often appeared in Germany even before the Third Reich rose to power. Associating the count with rats and plague is similar to how the Jews were portrayed in notorious anti-Semitic propaganda. I think, too, that the encrypted letter the count sent to Knock underscored what many Germans thought about Jews, that they communicated in esoteric languages and practiced a strange religion. Orlok, when he arrives in Germany, is an outsider, a dangerous foreigner seeking to kill and corrupt the good German people. Again, the Jews were always seen as outsiders with a hidden hostility to gentiles. The conclusion of the film only confirmed this thesis in my eyes, when a pure German woman using her wiles managed to defeat the evil count. Germans always worried about Jews marrying their women, so the idea that a girl could not only withstand the advances of the count but also use his lust to destroy him must have resonated deeply with certain segments of the audience. I could go on and on, matching certain scenes with how many Germans perceived the Jews.
I hope the film isn't anti-Semitic. But as a horror film, it is unmatched. Murnau's technical experimentation along with Max Schreck's portrayal of Orlok make this film a must see for horror fans. The DVD is good too, with a ton of extras. You get extensive liner notes on location sights, notes on Murnau's influences, still galleries, several different soundtracks, and a commentary track from a film historian. The quality of the picture transfer didn't look too good, but the movie is over eighty years old. If you haven't seen ""Nosferatu"" yet, you're missing out on a great experience.",1085356800,,5555,4.7219361483007205
1780128,5,B00006JDSI,"This is the film that got me interested in silent films and it's still one of my most favourites.  No matter how often I watch it, I'm always struck by the effectiveness of the film:  the characters, make-up, movements and some special effects which, compared to modern films may seem very primitive and crude, but when used at the right time, however, create the perfect effect.  There is also the simple matter of how Max Schreck, who plays the vampire, walks or stands, and being very tall and thin, wearing a sinister black coat, it's enough to already give you the creeps!
For novices to silent films I'd like to say that this film has much more depths that one might think, and you have to read the intertitles carefully to get the background or in-depth meanings that are intended.  I got much more out of the film after the second and third viewing and paying attention to both the intertitles and other details, such as how Ellen was under Nosferatu's spell from a distance, and sensed when her husband was in mortal danger in Nosferatu's castle.  There is also the interesting correlation between Nosferatu's presence and the Plague, and until science proved otherwise, people back then did believe that illnesses, especially a plague, were caused by evil, sinister beings.
For anyone who likes a film they can get their teeth into (pardon the pun) even if not a vampire/horror fan, this is a good one!  And as far as silent films go, definitely also in the ""classics"" department and a must-have in your collection.",1082592000,,1525,4.735849056603773

He is actually scary! Watch him terrify young Harker. Watch the crew of the Demeter meet their doom. Watch the count's long-distance hypnotic effect on Nina.

1780131,5,B00006JDSI,"(This review is for the Eureka version available in Australia)
A horror film nowadays is a genre film, generally not meant to be taken seriously. That is fine. But ""Nosferatu"" is a quite different type of film.
The film exudes German Expressionist style. While not, perhaps, as breathtaking as the bizzare imagery in Lang's ""Metropolis"", ""Nosferatu""'s imagery is quite unforgettable, and often unsettling.
My favourite scene is not among the famous scenes on board the ship. It is the scene where Hutter/Harker looks out of the door of his room, and sees Nosferatu standing there, stark and stiff, at the other end of the room outside. At first the audience cringes at the sight of Nosferatu unmasked; but the touch of genius is that the frame fades into a zoomed-in version of the same image - and Nosferatu IS STILL STANDING THERE...I think this is the only scene in any vampire film (admittedly I haven't seen many) where it is made symbolically clear that a vampirew is in fact an undead corpse. Nosferatu' stiff movements as he advances on Hutter also make him seem ""dead"".
There's also, of course, the most famous shot in the film, in which Nosferatu rises from his coffin like a stiff, dry Egyptian mummy. Again Nosferatu is emphasised to be really, really dead, and this is horrifying.
The reactions of Nosferatu's victims are also telling. My favourite is the scene where the captain ties himself to his tiller - then in a closeup we see his reaction to his first dight of Nosferatu. His terror is very underplayed, but since we have already seen the wildly hysterical reaction of his crewman, it is all the more horrible. Then there is the reaction of Hutter/Harker to the vampire, in which he literally grins with fear, then crawls into bed, completely paralysed with horror, looking like a frightened mouse or rabbit.
The ""supernatural"" quickness or jerkiness assoiated with the vampire is also effective, and somehow works better than the modern special effects in Coppola's film. Everyone knows about the freaky fast carriage that Count Orlok drives - a very very primitive special effect that is still eerie. The jerkiness of the carriage makes it seem, not merely fast, but possessed. There's also the scene where a jerky, superfast Orlok piles up coffins in his cart, then gets into one himself, then causes the coffin lid to jump on top of the coffin. Again, the primitive undercranking/stop motion makes the image jump unnaturally, producing a strange effect.
Nosferatu is a film with many memorable or disturbing images, which seem so original, even by todays standards, that it is no wonder the film is still so famous.
THE DVD - The Eureka edition of the DVD is both good and bad.
Good: The soundtrack by Art Zoyd is modern; but it is much better than it could have been. Admittedly I am not sure about the rap-style music that plays when Nosferatu is carrying his coffin around Wisborg; but aside from that the music is very appropriate, with whining electronic sounds, windy noises, slams, and organ music. The music when Nosferatu is advancing on Hutter is particularly good; the howling, screaming voices when Nosferatu's carriage turns into a ""negative image"" is also wonderful.
The intertitles are well-translated, though they could be less corny. I would not have translated one intertitle as ""it is creepy on the other side of the river""...but who can forget the description of Mr Knock? ""He paid his people well...!""
Bad: The CGI intertitles are too technologically slick for the disc, looking too contrived.
The tinting is nice; but for some reason all the scenes have been tinted sepia; the original British cinema release on which this is based had proper tinting, as well as the Art Zoyd soundtrack.
Furthermore this is not a perfect transfer. I admit, Nosferatu will probably never look perfect, thanks to problems with the loss of the negative; but there must be better transfers than this grainy, spotted one.
Overall the Eureka release is OK, and since it's the only version available in AUstralia, I suppose we have no real choice here!",1072137600,,4076,4.891618497109826
1780132,4,B00006JDSI,"A real estate agent (Alexander Granach) in the town of Wisborg, Germany receives a letter from a foreign aristocrat, Count Orlok, expressing an interest in purchasing a home in the town. The real estate agent dispatches his clerk, Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) to Transylvania to offer the Count a suitable house. Hutter bids his disappointed young wife farewell and eagerly sets out to make the sale of his career. He reaches Transylvania at the same time a mysterious disease is ravaging the countryside and finds the locals to be inviting but oddly superstitious. He also finds his host, Count Orlok (Max Schreck), to be an imposing and frightening figure. He finally senses that his wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), may be in grave danger and makes haste to return home. Meanwhile, Count Orlok is also headed for Wisborg, where he plans to  occupy his new home.

""Nosferatu"" was directed by F.W. Murnau in 1922. It was written by Henrik Galeen and is a loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel ""Dracula"", faithful to the novel's themes but not to its story. The cinematography is by Gunther Kramph. This version of the film's score (Image Entertainment DVD) was composed and performed in 1991by The Silent Orchestra and Timothy Howard, who sought out music by 19th century composers who would have been contemporary to Murnau's youth when creating the score. Like many films of the era, ""Nosferatu"" was filmed in black and white but then tinted so that the final product is a colored film. Murnau uses no fewer than 5 colors in ""Nosferatu"". The colors are especially important in this film since they are used not only to convey mood but also to represent the passage of time: Sepia for daylight or indoor light, blue for night, mauve for dawn and dusk. When we see the color change, we feel time slipping past. Much of the movie was filmed outdoors in bright sunlight, which it seems was too much for the film stock to handle. Highlights in the film are terribly overexposed, which annoyed me almost immediately. Unlike many of his expressionist contemporaries, F.W. Murnau didn't like to shoot indoors in front of sets. His love of nature is commendable, and it distinguished his work, but super-contrasty scenes with no detail in the highlights are the inevitable result. ""Nosferatu"" is so replete with symbolism that you will have to watch it several times to catch it all. Count Orlok commands attention whenever he is on screen. He is fascinating. But the narrative itself is weak. If you're just watching this movie for the story and its terror-inducing properties, as I did the first time I saw it, I think you will find your attention waning during scenes which don't contain Count Orlok. The film is best viewed as allegory. Seen as Freudian, Christian, pagan, expressionist, romanticist, and/or social allegory, the story develops so many facets and implications that the viewer can't keep up with them all. Taken literally, the narrative seems sloppy and nonsensical in places but is saved by Orlok's strong presence. I recommend numerous viewings, including one with the audio commentary enabled. Intertitles in English only.

The DVD (This refers to the Image Entertainment Special Edition DVD only.): Bonus features include an audio commentary by film historian Lokke Heiss, a tour of the film's locations, an essay explaining the phantom carriage ride scene, and a gallery of still photos and drawings with explanations. The audio commentary by Lokke Heiss is excellent. He discusses the romantic and expressionist influences in the film, as well as its structure, symbolism, technique, and allegorical implications. I highly recommend listening to the audio commentary on a second viewing. The tour of locations is also interesting. The condition of the print from which this DVD was made is reasonably good.

Therefore, there are countless versions of the film on DVD and VHS where the quality ranges from fair to poor and running time varies.

1780138,4,B00006JDSI,"I first saw this one on public television many years ago and it's one that I've wanted for my video collection for some time. For students of horror film, it is a MUST SEE. A true classic! For fans of vampire/Dracula lore, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still the PIONEER of all vampire films.
The director was sued for copyright by Bram Stoker's widow and most copies of the film were destroyed. Thankfully, enough survived intact so that we can view it today. The basic storyline from Stoker is intact, but there are a few changes that make this film worth viewing. For example, the time frame is set in the year 1838, rather than 1890 as in the Stoker novel. The Harkers live in Bremen Germany, rather than England.
In this film, the vampire does not have any wives which could have been effective. The rats that accompanied Nosferatu played a larger part in this film than in others, including a bit of low comedy when a warehouse worker is bitten on the foot. A rotund Reinfield capers about in a cartoonish manner,leering and sneering but this makes him seem all the MORE demented. The obligatory ride to the castle is RAPID to say the least, almost a ""Keystone Kop"" pace which makes it unintentionally funny. One sequence was done in an almost ""X-ray"" effect which could have been used more often. But the most eerie effect is Nosferatu's appearance. Lean and bald, with a mishapen skull and a lurching walk. His hands look like claws and his rat-like ears, a hooked nose, hollow eyes and sunken cheeks make a real impact. When he rises from his coffin, he's as rigid as a board. Unfortunatly, Harker comes across as a scatterbrained oaf and is totally useless in protecting Nina (Yes they changed her name)from the vampire. One scene in the castle has Harker childishly pulling a sheet over his head to protect himself from the approaching vampire. I was also disappointed by the limited part played by Van Helsing, Lucy Westerna and Jack Seward. Still, this tape is well worth having.

1780139,5,B00006JDSI,"There are a number of versions of the original Murnau film ""Nosferatu"" floating around out there, and as a big fan of the film, I've bought most of them and will discuss them so that you don't have to waste time and money trying to decide which to buy. Unfortunately, I am only going to compare the current DVD releases however, and only those in my part of the globe - Region 1. By all means, avoid the embarrassingly bad VHS version with the modern score by ""Type-O-Negative"".
This is a black & white silent film for those who don't know. Sound wasn't invented for another five years after this film was made and color wasn't introduced for another ten to twelve after that. Bram Stoker's widow successfully had most copies of this film destroyed by infringement of copyright during the twenties, so the few existing prints today are sadly in poor condition. Most films in the silent era were color-tinted, and rarely viewed as pure black & white (so don't put all the blame on Ted Turner for starting that trend). As there was no soundtrack in those days, live orchestras performed the music behind the film. Today, if the original score is not known, (as is the case with Nosferatu), then we try and ""fake it"" with a modern composition recorded onto the cassette, laserdisc, or DVD. Some modern scores are fitting and appropriate, while others just stink (such as the Type-O-Negative score). The other problem with older films is that projectors weren't standardized yet, so people produced films at all sorts of different ""running speeds"". Today, all film is photographed at 24 frames a second, but back then it was 20, 18, 30, whatever...this is why many films of that era, when translated to present day film, run speedy like a bad episode of the ""Keystone Cops"".
Basically, there are only two DVD versions available that you should consider if you are at all serious about adding this legendary classic to your home collection.
First, there's the IMAGE Entertainment version, which has two musical scores: one score is kind of lame and silly, while the second organ score is the better of the two. The DVD in tinted brightly as well. The real gem on this version is an outstanding commentary soundtrack by a German film expert that is so educational.
Second, is the best version available, which is produced by Kino. This version has the sharper picture, a slightly better running speed and contains a few scenes not seen in other version (Kino's is also the longest running version available). The Kino version also comes with two scores. The first score is my favorite available and would be perfect if not for a few ""vocal"" improvisations of a woman gasping when the actress onscreen is scared. It's embarrassing and cheezy. The second score is a completely inappropriate ""techno"" version that sounds more like a cheap Nine-Inch-Nails rip-off and doesn't fit the film at all. (I don't understand why people insist on giving this film a modern musical score to emphasize it's horror aspects when all they do is demean it). The Kino version sadly does not have a commentary track or it would be perfect. The Kino version is also color-tinted. I would personally like to see a version without color-tinting as I just find that annoying.
But as of this date, June 2003, the Kino version of the original 1922 Nosferatu is the one to buy. But if you want the wonderful commentary soundtrack, then go with the IMAGE Entertainment version instead.",1055462400,,3450,4.780569514237856
1780140,3,B00006JDSI,"Instead of 5 stars i give 3 to this edition, and here's why:
I am a fan of the original stuffs, in this case, i bought this edition thinking about the entire classic movie, with a new and improved transfer and without modifications, you know what i mean, just THE apropiated subtitles, additional opcional bg music and the DVD original special features.
I have to tell you that this is transfer of a 'colored version' of the movie. Sometime long ago,  someone gave color to the movie: instead of the original black & white, there's black & red when the scene happens during the afternoon, black & yellow in the morning, black & blue in the night...etc.
Another thing, for example: when a caracter reads a letter , this edition replaced the original close ups of the letter and it's contents for a computer generated draw of the letter and its's content, as you can imagine, with funny word fonts in english. This makes a great contrast between the really old movie and the clear old-simulated texts. I think this is a lack of good taste.
If you don't care about this little details, just buy it, it's a good and improved editon. A really new way to see and apreciate this classic.",1046131200,,1180,4.539906103286385

1780142,2,B00006JDSI,"This review has been written on May 4, 2008 (despite Amazon's header), and is a review of the Kino ""Ultimate DVD Edition"" of Nosferatu.

The only reason there are two stars rather than one is that this issue has an excellent restored and digitized print.  However, at 18 frames per second, it still seems jerky to me, with people's movements still not appearing to be natural.  Other marks against it are that the music score is uninvolving (despite it being ""authentic""), and the English intertitles are too flowery to be taken seriously.

This has been a film I have tracked for years, having purchased the latest ""restored"" version as each has come out.

However, this time, since the print is superior to anything else I have seen, I decided to take matters in my own hand, and instead rip the DVD into my computer, and have my way with it with my editing software.

So now, the version that I have on my self-produced DVD is shown at 15 frames per second (what I always understood to be the European standard for silent films).  All the motions now seem very natural and emotionally involving, without any jerky or unnaturally rushed movement.

I also created my own English intertitles, drawing from the original German intertitles on the second disc, which produced a much more direct impact to the story.  Having control over the editing process also allowed me to shorten the length of the narrative intertitles so that you don't have to wait forever for the movie to continue.

Finally, I added my own film score, drawing from the many classical CD's in my collection.  The music is now emotionally involving, and helps carry the movie to its poignant conclusion.

Of course, having Danny Elfman do the film score would be even better, but short of that, all I need now is a good attorney who can help me secure the rights to the video and all the music tracks I have used, and I could market a production superior to any out there today... :-)",1044403200,,1954,4.631884057971014
1780143,5,B00006JDSI,"Count Orlock appears in silence, long of nail, sharp of tooth, pale of flesh, bald of head. Creeping forward, ghoulishly menacing, eyes shimmering in the darkness, plagueing his victims with fear & dread. There is no escaping the morbid spell of the nosferatu.........
The wraith-like, captivating phantom played convincingly by Max Schreck, haunts one's visions & rememberance as probably the most horrific incarnation of vampiric evil the world has ever seen. A remake by the same name in Year VII A.S., & Stephen King's Salem's Lot, resurrected the eerie spechtre to re-terrify the world of the living.
The original 1922 version of NOSFERATU scared people out of their skins. In that time of puritanical virginity, those who dared to sit in a darkened theatre to witness this first of vampiric movies {up until then, there were only plays}, were in for a scare they were not prepared for.
NOSFERATU is based upon Bram Stoker's characterization of Dracula, but a few names have been modified here & there, which gave it a bit more of an original feel. The looming figure of Orlock still brings chills to the unprepared.
This is a good one to rent for vampire enthusiasts & archivists, who can still appreciate a horror classic. For those jaded, & seeking a new thrill, concentrate on how it must have been like to live in that era, when motion pictures were relatively new, & your life had been sheltered up to the point of walking into the theatre this night.

1780144,5,B00006JDSI,"By not having any, FW Murnau's visionary film Nosferatu succinctly demonstrates how severely dialogue can dilute and trivialise a piece of cinema. Even disregarding the technical and artistic limitations prevailing at the time this film was made (if by 1929 cinema was no longer in its infancy, it was certainly still pre-adolescent), this film is one of the most astonishing pieces of cinema I have ever seen.

What is greatest about it - and pretty much everything about it is truly great - is the visual imagery and the beautiful way in which every scene is framed. I think I'd have missed a lot of this if I'd been focusing on a linear narrative, which is what an audio dialogue would have obliged me to do. At first the absence of dialogue seems an imposition on the modern viewer (it wasn't one on the director, for I am certain he felt no need for it) for it forces one to concentrate on looking. It seems an odd thing to say, but in these enlightened cinematic times, I really don't think we look properly any more. And what a treat it is when you do.

Not a frame is wasted. Each shot - even such innocuous scene-setters as morning light falling across Hutter's face and Ellen relaxing with a kitten by a window - anticipates another, and creates or reinforces motifs as the film carries on. Murnau subtitled Nosferatu ""a symphony of horror"", and (though it must sound frightfully pretentious to say so) the construction of this film really is symphonic.

While it forged countless cinematic devices which have since become cliches of the horror genre, when you view it as a symphony, it really isn't a horror at all. In this day and age it isn't frightening, but it certainly is haunting, and beautiful, but more than anything else, it's sexual. Despite having seen many different versions of the Dracula story (including Coppola's overtly sexual reading), I had never appreciated how deeply this story is an essay on sexual repression and potency. When you look at it this way - Nosferatu is really just a personification of Hutter's absent sexuality - the horror falls away. And this is unquestionably how it was intended: Watch Ellen's first approach to Hutter at the commencement of the film. We see the closed door, resembling a coffin lid. She opens it and creeps around the door, and approaches Hutter - from stage right - with her talons outstretched. When he accepts her embrace she nuzzles into his neck ... action for action, it is exactly how Orlock first approaches Hutter in his castle. Given how carefully every scene was framed (from time to time they resemble paintings, they're so well constructed), this could not possibly be a coincidence.

Aside from the bloodsucking (which apart from the final scene, is all implied), there are many truly haunting images: darkness seeping like blood across the Carpathian valley; darkening skies behind the rugged mountains; the black ship of death silhouetted against the sun; a procession of funerals down an otherwise abandoned Wisborg street; Ellen waiting amongst partially submerged crucifixes on a desolate ocean beach for her loved one to return (note to file: it is Orlock who is coming by sea; Hutter, by contrast, is coming round the mountains); and one quite extraordinary shot in which, as the black horse-drawn coach carries Hutter to Orlock, the frame is suddenly plunged into the negative - but eerily, the Coach and Horseman remain black...

The version I viewed had an extremely enlightening narrative from a satin-voiced Australian film critic, and some interesting featurettes about the history of the locations in which Nosferatu was filmed.

the only point on which I'd mark the film down - and then only really on ""authenticity"" grounds - is for its curiously (and ironically) dated sounding electronic soundtrack, which sounded like it was generated some time in the eighties. While it is a moody, discordant piece which fits the film well, the obvious anachronism does jar a little at first.

Werner Herzog made a fairly faithful ""talkie"" remake of Nosferatu in the late 1970s with the great Klaus Kinski as the count and Wagner's Gotterdamerung providing the soundtrack. This is well worth checking out, but in terms of building your film library, Murnau's original is a keeper.

The story is the same as Dracula but it is told differently.  The location is changed to Germany and there are very little sets.  Most of the movie is done in locations that were landmarks back in 1922 so that there is a more realistic feel.  The best scene when Count Orlock is traveling by boat and the mates mysterious become ill and die.  I actually jumped when he finally revealed himself.

Based on Dracula, this film deals with a man going to the ""land of the phantoms"" in Romania, to sell property, to a fellow, who turns out to be a vampire. The Vamp would like to kill his guest, but when he sees his wife, he travels to her town to have her. The scenes are brilliantly shot in black and white, in fearsome surroundings. Heavy shadows, and spooky music play. The camera is always still, it does not move. The acting or overacting is in the style of Expressionism, where all emotions are thrown out to be displayed. Before I sat down to watch this I felt a sense of dread, as I heard how great and terrifying this film is. As it started it got more and more eerier, and scary. I can understand why this film is regarded so high, as it is so entertaining, and captivating. That's quite good, since its in black and white with no sound, and moves at a slow pace.

1780148,5,B00006JDSI,"Just when I thought I'd FINALLY owned the definitive version of ""Nosferatu"" (the 84-minute version from IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT), along comes this ""AUTHORIZED"" version from KINO.  The running time:  93 minutes!  Nearly 85% of the scenes are longer (by a few feet of film), creating a much smoother, atmospheric and tension-building vision that Murnau had originally planned.  Some scenes are COMPLETELY new to me (after having owned over 12 different versions of the film--from 8mm, to VHS, and now to DVD!!)  This KINO print has come from some archival Italian film museum, and is even sharper than the IMAGE version...and even more appropriately color-tinted--(Count Orlok walking the deck of the ship is now BLUE for NIGHT!--for those who were bothered by the mistakenly amber-tinted sequence on the IMAGE disc).  Admittedly, this version actually gave me chills...for the first time!

1780150,5,B00006JDSI,"This movie will send a chill up and down your spine.  Max Schreck's Dracula is the scariest of any vampire in all of movie making - it is the most vicious and demonic, which truly does parallel Stoker's book.  This is not to say that Oldman's Dracula wasn't just as satisfying but, because this is a ""silent"" movie, an emphasis on the visualisation of the vampire must be made.  With Schreck's vampire, you see what you don't hear: the evil and horror of the words Stoker has him speak in his book.
I think that a good horror movie doesn't scare you directly, but allows you to scare yourself. Nosferatu does this superbly. This is certainly not a jump-out-of-your-seat thriller and can be a bit campy.

1780152,5,B00006JDSI,"Filmed in 1922, the director F.W. Murnau set out to film an adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel Dracula. Although he couldn't get the rights to the novel, he pursued filming it anyway, changing the names of the characters and some of the plot points in the process. Stoker's widow sued the makers of Nosferatu for copyright infringement and won. All known prints of the film were destroyed as per the settlement. The German character actor Max Schreck played the vampire (now named Count Orlok) and was ready for international stardom. Since the film didn't make it to the theaters, fame eluded him in his lifetime.
Luckily years later, a print surfaced and the reputation of Nosferatu was restored. But why does it get such acclaim? A lot of viewers today find it old and dated, without the shocks and scares of modern gore-fests you currently see in the theaters and video stores. That's a shame because Nosferatu influenced a lot of those movies.
Modern viewers are more used to a ""sexy"" vampire. Since illicit sex is often the theme in vampire films, it makes more sense to be seduced by an attractive, exotic vampire. Count Orlok doesn't match that description in the least. He is repulsive-looking and resembles a rat.
And yet the underlying sex theme is still there. As it's pointed out on a DVD commentary, Count Orlok is the doppelgnger of Hutter, the male lead. Both vie for the attentions of Ellen. Though she is married to Hutter, she doesn't return his affections as strongly as he gives her. But to save the town, she gives herself freely to the vampire.
Of course, others see different themes in Nosferatu. Some view Count Orlok as a precursor to Hitler and the plague to Nazism, which would come a few years later. He even seems to give a Nazi salute as he dies.
And still others point out the many viewpoints through windows and the use of forbidding shots of nature, which show an influence of 19th century German painters like Caspar David Friedrich. Not to mention the equal influences of early 20th century German Expressionism with its use of stark shadows and unlit corners.
But you don't need to see any of that at first. You can enjoy it on its own merits as a very creepy horror film. One of my earliest memories of watching horror films was watching Nosferatu one October Saturday afternoon on TV. The scene where the vampire's shadow ascends the stairs on the way to his prey gave me nightmares for weeks and lingered in my memory until I saw it again twenty years later on video.
How ironic that Nosferatu is called A Symphony of Horror, when it's a silent film. But the audio tracks offered on the DVD from Image Entertainment do embellish the film well. Hitting the audio button on your DVD while the film plays will take you to your choice of three audio tracks recorded especially for this DVD. The first is a modern, quirky score by The Silent Orchestra. The second is a more traditional organ score by Timothy Howard. The third track is an illuminating commentary of the film by Lokke Heiss.
The goodies on the DVD don't stop there. The print itself has been remastered from high quality 35mm film and is restored to its original running time, as well as to its original color tints (although I think I preferred it in just black & white). A favorite feature of mine is the photo album of the locations used in Nosferatu as they appear in the film and how they look today.",1022198400,,3407,4.605263157894737

This pseudo-scary weird accompaniment totally unhinged the creepiness and overall feel of the entire film.  I ask all filmmakers or film distributioners,  WHY DO YOU THIS?  The films are fine by themselves!  If they're such great cult classics already,  why change them?  Sure,  I can completely tolerate Director's Cut Versions of a film,  geez,  I actually prefer it if that is the vision the director had in mind(Speaking of which,  catch the 20th Anniversare Director's Cut of Dawn of the Dead,  there's an example of a great directors cut).  Anyways,  NOSFERATU is an amazing film,  and I say go see it,  but if you happen to see the cover above,  I would personally steer clear of this version unless you're deaf or have a high tolerance level...See Nosferatu,  the original gothic,  and if that wasn't enough,  catch Shadow of the Vampire.

1780157,4,B00006JDSI,"From the point of view of someone in 1922, this must have scared the daylights out of people.  We now are a lot less frightened; gore-driven horror films and hyper-realistic special effects have inured us to a lot of things that would have scared our great-grandparents into unconsciousness.
But even now, Max Schreck's performance is sublimely creepy.  His Orlok/Nosferatu is not the suave sexual vampire of post-Bela Lugosi times.  He's an incarnation of sickness and disease, whose totem animal is the plague-carrying rat rather than the bat.  He seems to carry the miasma of the grave, of rotting wood and mold and things that have decayed too far to even have the stench of death any more.
The other actors' performances are sometimes laughable and hammy, no doubt about that.  Greta Schroeder only seems to get into her character at the end, while Gustav Von Wangenheim, well, his performance is just plain odd and sometimes guffaw-worthy.
But Schreck, as Nosferatu, drains the inadvertent humor away, and makes you watch him every time he's onscreen.  He makes your skin crawl looking at him.  It's brilliant work for an actor in that period, handicapped as they were by the absence of sound and color.  Schreck seems to use these handicaps to his advantage, almost as if he knew they were there.  It's a very prescient role, in a sense; he set a tone, and put across a unique vision of the Vampire, that has never been matched or equaled.
The association of Nosferatu with the Black Plague is clearly drawn.  Nosferatu does not offer the vampire life as an eternal party where one never grows old.  He offers a vision of the vampire as someone who is ill unto death but cannot die.  He draws the life from others to keep himself at the edge of survival, while causing others to die from the disease he cannot let himself succumb to.  He points up something the other vampire movies do not address; the survival of the vampire is a trade-off.  He trades the Devil your life for his.  This makes the vampire worse than a simple predator. It makes him diseased in both mind and body, and willing to spread that disease.  Schreck's Nosferatu puts this point across with chilling power.
Yes, the restoration is as good as could be expected, especially considering this movie was thought to be utterly destroyed at several points in its history.  And I don't have a problem with the new music, although I can see why some people prefer to play gothic rock while watching it.  (Nick Cave, in particular, would go well with this movie.)
But the real reason you should see this is to watch Max Schreck, to watch Murnau's direction (which is an artistic statement in itself), and to sit and think about the question of what Nosferatu represents.  Nosferatu will not scare the pants off you.  But in the night, in the wolf hours, he will lurk at the back of your mind.  And what he represents is more frightening than anything his descendents have been able to show us.",1016928000,,2966,4.687258687258687

The organ score is bland and detracts from the horror, while words like ""doofus"" and ""cheesy"" are apt words for the modern soundtrack (the best way to imagine how it'll sound in 20 years is to think of what a ""modern"" soundtrack from the 70s would sound like now).

This was an unlicensed movie version of the novel ""Dracula."" Names were changed in an attempt to hide that fact that the movie was being illegally made. Somehow the movie survived even though there had been a court order to destroy the prints. Some video editions will have the original names, others may have the characters matched up to their names in the novel. For example, ""Dracula"" instead of ""Orlok"" or ""Harker"" instead of ""Hutter."" This DVD uses the original names.
I have the Video Yesteryear videotape edition, Arrow Video videotape edition (with music by Type O Negative), the LaserDisc by Image/Blackhawk Films, and now the DVD by Image/Blackhawk Films. I find it interesting that each version has a different version of the onscreen titles. The LaserDisc edition might be the only one that appeared to have original titles. All of the others had re-created the titles for that edition except for titles that involved handwritten notes. This DVD is different - all titles were redone. Plus, it seems to use a different translation. Some of the titles appear to be more wordy on the DVD than some other editions.
There is a different style for each type of title - speech, narration, and handwritten stuff. The speech titles follow the more traditional silent film title format with large text, but they don't use a basic font. It's not the best choice, but it's not too bad. Handwritten notes use a simple font that look like handwriting, but not too fancy. It looks like basic letters. I hate the narration titles - overly fancy letters with loops all over the place. It looks more like a handwritten title, but it is the narration. All of the titles were created with a character generator (electronic device used to add titles to video) with simulated scratches added in to make the titles fit in.
Overall the quality of the film itself is very good. You do have the option of two different musical tracks - new age or organ. I personally don't like the new age music, and it doesn't seem to fit what's happening onscreen. The same could be said for the organ score, but I feel the organ fits it better. (It may not be new age, but to me it seems like it is.) I felt my Video Yesteryear tape had the best music, and later I found out it was simply Vivaldi's Four Seasons - but it actually fit fairly well. Because of differences in frame rates and possible differences in the prints the companies had access to plus the composition may not have been played in proper order, simply playing a CD of Vivaldi may not match as well. Some parts may have also been repeated. ""Summer - Presto"" was used for the coach ride to the castle on that videotape. I wish this DVD had some classical style music written for it.
You can also listen to a somewhat boring expert on the other audio track. The expert sounds as if it's reading his words and tends to speak in a monotone. He is the same person who speaks during some of the bonus material.
The extras on this DVD are very nice. Although I don't care for the voice, there is much information here about each of the exteriors used during the filming - what they were then and how they look now. There is also some information about some of the techniques used in the filming of this movie.
The DVD menus are nicely done - a little Orlok head is used as the selection pointer. When you go to the extras menu, you see a part of the movie where a door opens, and the menu options fly through the doorway before becoming an active menu onscreen.",1015027200,,3668,4.49251497005988
1780160,4,B00006JDSI,"I was most struck by the acting of the characters, which was very exaggerated. It has been said that Nosferatu's actors were directed this way because it was German expressionism. Even so, it seems that many older films have rather unrealistic acting and, in talkies, unrealistic modes of speech, such as the vocal inflections and accents. Since there was no talking in this one, the latter doesn't apply, but no doubt that would have occurred had there been. Much of the physical mannerisms appeared influenced by stage acting, which is understandable since the actors would have had experience in only that sort of setting. Nonetheless, all of this didn't detract from the film and made their emotions much more obvious to an audience that can't hear them speak.
I seem to remember the film Metropolis being at a higher than normal speed, like it was filmed at 15 or 20 frames a second and sped up a little. Most of Nosferatu appeared to have been filmed at a higher frame rate with only a few parts at accelerated speed for a purely artistic effect. In fact, much of this film seemed slowly filmed, with subtle, extended shots. The most notable is when the vampire is coming into the protagonist's bedroom for the first time. He very slowly creeps in, for almost equally creepy effect.
There seemed to be a fascination with tall buildings, prominent shapes, and framing symbols. In Nosferatu, the dominant shapes are arches and windows. I am not certain what, if any, metaphorical symbolism is meant by this. However, it does serve to show us how tall the vampire is when he stands in an arch and how much the city folk stay in doors, only peaking out through a window occasionally.
What I disliked about the film was the length of this particular cut. Due to the absence of recorded vocals, it would be best to limit the length of silent films to about an hour, give or take a few minutes. My peak level of concentration occurred at just before the hour mark, and the last 30 minutes seemed to burden my patience somewhat. I can definitely see the utility of the shorter Nosferatu cuts that were supposedly put together.",1012608000,,2124,4.681818181818182
1780161,5,B00006JDSI,"That's the question you'll be asking yourself after viewing Max Shreck's performance as the titular character in Nosferatu. A film once nearly lost to us, Nosferatu is perhaps the film that best represents the creepiness and terror of Stoker's Dracula. Murnau successfully utilizes all the tools and techniques at his disposal to create a film thick with atmosphere. What he is unable to do with dialogue, he does with clever special effects and effectively framed shots and sequences.
This DVD presentation of the film is very good. It offers two musical soundtracks. The first is a simple organ meant to show how the audience would have experienced the film 80 years ago. The second is a modern orchestral composition that I feel better serves the film. It has a haunting, gothic feel to it that fits the action on-screen like a glove. There is also a commentary track by noted film historian Lokke Heiss. While Heiss is clearly a very learned scholar, he is one dull commentator. Honestly, I have an appreciation of silent film but his droning on without the benefit of a musical backdrop nearly put me to sleep. Heiss also narrates a much shorter featurette on the present-day sites of the film that is a little easier to swallow.
I urge you if you are either a film enthusiast or a fan of the horror genre to pick up this well done presentations of one of the best films ever (silent or otherwise).",1010620800,,1403,4.7073170731707314
1780162,4,B00006JDSI,"If Gothic you want, then Gothic this is-  a pleasant diversion from all the modern, glam, vampire poseur films. Filmed in 1922, Nosfartu is an historic, horror masterpiece. Without fast-action fight sequences, without high-tech special effects, without even dialogue (remember this was filmed in 1922) the film simply exudes gothic ambiance. The score from Cleopatra Records is the perfect audio backdrop to the visual stimulus; And, the music is continuous throughout the film (good thing, this is a silent movie otherwise). You may also want to buy ""Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola)"" and ""Shadow of the Vampire"" as they yield more storyline and provide a (fictional?) documentary prelude to Nosferatu. The three films together comprise an interesting trilogy (or shall we say, orgy) of vampire cinema. Having recently viewed these two other films made the viewing of this film far more meaningful.  This is no ordinary movie; don't expect to be entertained in an ordinary manner. Nosferatu is more 'feel' and 'attitude' than blatant bite-my-neck action. After several viewings you may find yourself listening to the soundtrack as primary entertainment, while the movie visuals provide secondary allure. On the complaint side- there were no printed materials included with the DVD-- no track listing, no historical by-lines. Nor does the DVD have any additional features. For these small omissions, ""Nosferatu"" falls slightly short of perfection, but rates a great 4 out of 5 stars.",1009324800,,1482,5.383620689655173

1780164,5,B00006JDSI,"I bought ""Nosferatu"" on Halloween night, to screen a double-feature with ""Shadow of the Vampire"".  This turned out to be a terrific idea and caused me to wish, for the first time since childhood and my array of Star Wars costumes, that Halloween came eleven or twelve times a year.
""Nosferatu"" may be 80 years old, but its influence is, amusingly enough, going to be eternal.  The ""Symphony of Horror"" special edition DVD is absolutely a must-have, with three audio tracks that basically create three different versions of the film, and with three excellent mini-features.
The basic audio track is an organ score derived from early-19th-century Romantic composers.  Married to the film's flickering tinted images, this makes ideal Halloween (or, indeed, any post-midnight) viewing.  The second audio score is more experimental, more modern, and much, much more fun.  Whereas the organ track basically lies underneath the movie and provides a traditional (if static) experience, the ""Silent Orchestra"" compositions give the undead film a new life.  This rock-jazz-classical track positively breathes in the way that Dracula never could.
The final audio track is the commentary by German film expert Lokke Heiss.  Don't be fooled by the man's voice and delivery, which is about as dynamic as balsa wood and interesting as an American cheese sandwich on white bread.  He cites both scholarly film treatises and Stephen King as he discusses Murnau's influences, the film's light-dark composition, and the use of mirrors and windows within the movie.  This is a terrific commentary track in that it increased my understanding of the move ten-fold.  Pity they couldn't have had someone with an actual voice (like Christopher Lee) read Mr. Heiss's words.
The featurettes range from cute to weird.  Weirdest is the ""Nosfera-Tour"", ten minutes worth of home movies narrated once more by Heiss (oy vey) as he presents pictures of what the film's ""Wisborg"" looks like in the year 2000.  The ""Phantom Carriage Ride"" is very eerie, spotlighting as it does one of the truly *bizarre* moments in the film.  Finally, the art/photo gallery is splendid, one of the best galleries I've seen on a DVD.  The real treasure comes at the beginnng -- the charcoal drawings that were producer Albin Grau's original renderings of Nosferatu.
The DVD packaging -- cardboard case with plastic snap -- may be cheap, but it contains within one of filmdom's finest moments, and provides far more than just 81 minutes of enjoyment.  Highly, highly recommended.",1005350400,,2526,5.1568627450980395

That means, without recomposed music and without improved images... Does anyone know a way for me to obtain that version? And then I have another question. I read once about 'the first horrormovie ever made'. It was also a vampiremovie and dated back to 1896 and was described in a Amzazon.com review of Nosferatu...but I'm not able to find that review anymore.

1780167,5,B00006JDSI,"The new edition of the restored NOSFERATU is even more improved than the former version. The new transfer is far more crisper, sharper, allows us to explore the visual sensibilities of Murnau's beautifully worked out compositions, the subtle nuances lights and shadows. The intertitles' design is more elaborated and enhance the film's gothic, haunting, yet inteligent and authentic feeling; taking form of a historical record of ""the great death of Wisborg in 1843"". The Timothy Howard organ score seemed to me perfect for the film, but the new modern score by the Silent Orchestra is also very interesting in exloring another dimention of Murnau's vison of ""a symphony of horror"". While the organ score enhance the classic horror aspect of fear, the new score freely explores the psychological dimentions of the story, of sex, desire, and frustratrions. Both tracks are on this DVD. The new special features includes series of comparions of the film's scenes and photos of the locations as they look today, guided by Lokke Haas, who also provides an insightful audio commentary (which was already on the former edition). With the new transfer, ofcourse one would see that most of this ""German Expressionist"" classic was actually, mostly shot on location... Well, now we can compare it with how the actual places look like. No need to say, NOSFERATU is the first film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA, and today still remains the best, and probably even the most modern cinematic vision to this apocalyptic tale. Frankly, the dashing gentleman-vampyre as portrayed by Bela Lugosi et all is not scary at all to contemporary eyes, while Max Schreck's incredible performance as the blood-sucking count, weak at the first sight, victim of his own desire, touches something underneath our mind, the subcontious nerve of fear within us.

1780170,5,B00006JDSI,"The 2001 edition of this DVD from Image offers a vastly improved picture quality over the 1998 edition (which was made from a 1991 source).  To me the difference is so great it is day and night.  Where the picture was soft and contrasty in the '98 edition, it is now clear, sharp, and detailed in the 2001 edition.  One good example is in the scene where the hero first discovers a bite mark on his neck; the mark (just a black dot) could barely be seen on the 1998 edition, but it shows up clearly on the improved picture of the 2001 edition.  The 2001 edition is easily the best-looking version of the 1922 German silent classic and I doubt it could look any better.  I envy those who haven't seen the film and will see it on this DVD for the first time.
A new, more modern-sounding music score is included along with the more gothic organ score from the '98 edition.  Tinting has been modified in some shots; a scene on the beach is tinted in dull green instead of brown in the '98 edition.  Many intertitle cards have been re-written -- they are now generally more verbose.  Title cards representing reading material have also been re-designed with a more archaic-looking font, which might be harder to read for some.
The audio commentary is still here.  The still-frame gallery section is expanded, and the stills, badly scanned in the '98 edition, were re-scanned in much better quality for the '01 edition, some of them in color.  A new still-frame section, named ""A Tour of Nosferatu"", gives a ""then-and-now"" comparison of the many locations seen in the film.  This is a clip of the ""phantom carriage"" scene shown in reverse black-and-white, showing that the carriage was actually cloaked in white when filmed.",986169600,,1718,4.618421052631579

But 'Nosferatu' is no ordinary horror, even if it is the only one to have that crinkly, sepia, medieval European look and atmosphere you imagine when reading classic horror books.  It is in fact impishly subversive, disarmingly comic, and a thorough analysis of why we watch films (look at all those eyes and voyeurs, the foregrounding of the mechanics of film (negative, stock etc.)), about how it saves us from joining with other people and losing ourselves, our identities, in union.  That bleak.",985910400,,777,5.102362204724409
1780172,5,B00006JDSI,"In 1921, director F.W. Murnau set out to make a horror film based on Bram Stoker's novel, ""Dracula,"" but was denied the rights to the property by Stoker's estate.  Undeterred, however, Murnau merely changed the title to ""Nosferatu,"" the name of the title character to ""Count Orlok,"" then proceeded to make what has come to be considered nothing less than a classic of the silent film era.  An unsettling film (especially for the times in which it was made), it is a faithful adaptation of Stoker's story, and brings images to the screen, the likes of which at the time, had never before been seen.  And although by today's standards much of it may seem relatively tame, there is an innate sense of the sinister about it that is timeless.  For the same elements that so unnerved audiences in 1922 when it was released, are equally discomfiting now, most of which is courtesy of Max Schreck, who portrayed Count Orlok.  It was the first screen appearance for what is now the most famous vampire in history, and the German character actor Schreck brought an eerie presence to the role that has never been equaled.  Bela Lugosi may be considered the definitive Dracula-- his portrayal is certainly the most well known-- but even he could not match the sense of evil that Schreck brought to the character.  The scene in which Schreck's shadow is cast on the wall as he slowly negotiates a staircase, emphasizing his misshapen head and elongated fingers and nails, is an image that leaves an indelible impression on the memory, as does Schreck's overall appearance:  Lanky, though slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes.  It was Schreck's greatest screen role, and had it not been for a lawsuit by Stoker's estate that prevented wide distribution of the film, it would no doubt have made him a star.  The supporting cast includes John gottowt, Alexander Granach, Wolfgang Heinz, Max Nemetz, Gustav von Wangenheim, Ruth Landshoff and Greta Schroder.  An air of mystery surrounded the set during the filming of ""Nosferatu"" that became something of a myth, which began with the fact that Schreck, a method actor, was never seen by cast nor crew without his makeup and in character.  And it was further perpetuated when it may have been implied by Murnau that Schreck was actually a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire, all of which goes a long way toward proving that ""hype"" is nothing new to the entertainment industry.  One of the three most highly regarded German directors of the times, Murnau, whose philosophy was that ""nothing existed beyond the frame,"" directed a number of films, but none achieved the lasting notoriety of ""Nosferatu.""  For film buffs everywhere, as well as aficionados of silent pictures, this film is a must-see, and a perfect companion piece to the recently released (2000) ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" the film by E. Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of ""Nosferatu.""  A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.  This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies.",984873600,,3196,4.912639405204461
1780173,4,B00006JDSI,"Having just purchased the DVD of F.W. Murnau's great NOSFERATU, I'm intrigued by the way the mood of the film itself changes when different versions of the soundtrack are played.  This DVD contains two separate soundtracks: one is an organ score based on the original score used for this film in the days of the silent era, whereas the other is a modern orchestral symphony composed especially for this DVD by ""The Silent Orchestra,"" a.k.a. musicians Carlos Garza and Rich O'Meara.  The organ score is eerie and moody, but I find myself drawn more towards the modern-day score, with its drums and bells and string instruments.  Maybe it's because I grew up in the modern era of movies, where fully orchestral movie soundtracks are the norm.  In the silent days, of course, the soundtrack was provided either by a live organist or by playing a pre-recorded soundtrack (though I think the live organists were more popular - when theaters could afford them), so having a full symphony soundtrack was probably a rarity in those days.  NOSFERATU was a work of art, but I don't think it was a high-prestige film: since Bram Stoker's widow successfully sued the production company and the movie was ordered to be destroyed, I can't imagine that many high-brow, luxurious movie palaces would have screened this movie.  So the organ soundtrack was more of the norm.
But the orchestral score composed for this DVD is very appealing: it's almost 'avante-garde' in its use of instruments, especially with the way bells are used to create an eerie, dream-like atmosphere during the journey to the castle of Count Orlok.  I've heard of the controversy surrounding the 'modernized' soundtracks created for various silent films, such the Club Foot Orchestra's score for SHERLOCK JR. or the famous (infamous?) Moroder presentation of METROPOLIS...but in the case of NOSFERATU, I think the symphonic soundtrack works very well.
(The picture quality on the DVD is very good, as well.  I don't have the laserdisc issue of the film from the mid-1990s, so I can't say offhand which version has a better quality print.)",984873600,,2096,4.968571428571429
1780174,4,B00006JDSI,"This is still one of the best horror movies ever, but time has not been kind to the ending of this old-fashioned nightmare.  These days we expect a huge bang at the end - Nosferatu ends with a whimper.  It's still a great movie, but not quite as rewatchable as Metropolis or even Battleship Potemkin.  The special effects are, for the time, ingenious and creepy, and Max Schreck is a special effect that never ages.  He is probably the most vampiric vampire actor ever, and the best moments of the film are the shots that follow him lurching slowly out of the shadows.  All in all, this movie is not going to scare a modern horror lover, but it has great atmosphere and some classic images.  No vampire film is complete without an homage to Nosferatu, and every horror library needs a copy of this.
Technically, this is pretty good for a silent-movie DVD, light-years ahead of the Metropolis DVD.  The picture is mostly clean, if a little murky, and there are 2 good soundtracks on it.  The Silent Orchestra's score is great.  It's my understanding that nobody knows what the original score for Nosferatu was, so it's perfectly legitimate to choose a different score if you like.  I like to watch this one with some old Cocteau Twins playing...",984528000,,1244,4.613636363636363
1780175,5,B00006JDSI,"If Todd Browning's ""Dracula"" is about the sound of Bela Lugosi's accented voice saying ""Good Evening,"" then F. W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" is about the sights of Max Schreck's grostesque figure rising up out of his coffin.  The fact that this is a silent film actually adds to the atmospheric tension; think of the moment when the death ship slips into the port of Bremen, carrying its cargo of death.  The story is clearly Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" (although the names have been changed to pretend otherwise and avoid paying the author's estate), and this 1922 film is actually more faithful than most versions of the novel, which almost invariably avoid the actual conclusion to the tale.  Murnau's version ends with vampire's downfall being caused by a sacrifice based on the love of Ellen Hutter (Greta Schroder, the ""Mina"" character) for Thomas (Gustav von Wangenehim as the ""Jonathan Harker"" character).  Even though Schreck's ""Count Orlok"" is clearly an example of German Expressionism with his gaunt countenance and immensely long talons he stalks his prey through a decidedly realistic 19th-century world, which also somehow magically adds to the film's effectiveness.  Similarly, the ""special effects"" are nothing more than such rudimentary tricks as stop motion and double exposure, but none the less potent for their simplicity.  Perhaps the greatest testament to this film is that directors who have filmed the Dracula story since ""Nosferatu"" have included homages to Murnau's masterpiece, from Browning (the actor playing the count is also the coachman) to Coppola (the count's terrifying shadow cast large on the wall).  When released in 1922 this film was also known as ""Nosferatu the Vampire,"" ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror,"" ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Terror,"" and even ""Terror of Dracula.""  The 1998 reissue title in the United States was ""Nosferatu: The First Vampire.""",982713600,,1885,5.280936454849498
1780176,5,B00006JDSI,"Having seen the marvelous ""Shadow of the Vampire"" a few nights ago, I went home and watched the Image DVD of F.W. Murnau's classic ""Nosferatu"". Ever wake up from a nightmare with the feeling that you were suffocating? Well, I have that feeling when I watch ""Nosferatu"". The film is not without its ""shocks"", such as the scene when Orlock rises up from his coffin aboard the doomed ship, like an erect, diseased male organ, but its power is in its overall creepy, almost stifling sense of doom. The camerawork is remarkable, free of the staginess that would undermine Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" ten years later. The staginess of Browning's film may have been due to the problems with early sound film, as well as laziness on Browning's part, where the film looks like ""a filmed play"", with the exception of the remarkable first scenes in Transylvania. But, back to ""Nosferatu"". The print quality is excellent, considering the fact that this film is 80 years old, and the organ score contributes to the nightmare on the screen. My only complaint about ""Nosferatu"" is the ridiculous overacting, but hey, this IS a silent film. And now, I have to put my own ""spin"" on the classic image of Max Schreck as Count Orlock. When something is created that is so incredibly frightening, it becomes a ""classic image"".  Count Orlock looks like an incredibly thin, two-legged rat. Thomas Kuntz, a brilliant sculptor and model-kit designer, whose figure of Count Orlock is a masterpiece, says, ""He puts the RAT in Nosferatu"".

1780177,2,B00006JDSI,"Don't get me wrong - I've loved this movie since I saw it as a child, but this release leaves much to be desired.  There are many good points of course: the commentary by Lokke Heiss, production and concept art, the restoration quality of the film, and even the design of the case, with a great Albin Grau painting of Max Schreck as Count Orlok.
On to what I didn't like about it: first, the tinting of the film.  I've alwasy seen Nosferatu presented in stark black and white, and this always added to the creepy feel of the movie.  However, Image Entertainment has chosen to use bright tints on the film in order to more clearly present moods, locations, times of day, etc.  supposedly, this is how it was originally presented?  It is quite distracting, and I feel it takes away from the quality of the video.  My second issue is with the soundtrack options, of which you get two new ones.  The first, by the Silent Orchestra, gets the right mood sometimes, but is too full and modern for this movie.  It's very out of place.  The second, an organ score by Timothy Howard, is too quiet, very bland, and adds nothing to the mood of the film.  This being a silent movie, the music is a very important part, and I feel that both of these fail miserably at reflecting what is occuring on the screen.
It makes me long for earlier VHS editions I've seen, which, even though their video quality wasn't as good, were in regular B&W and had appropriate soundtracks which succeeded at mirroring the action on screen.  Oh well, I can wait for another...",981849600,,1543,4.455516014234876

My friends and I watched this DVD twice before going to see the new film. Although I'm not as naive as I was at ten, this film is still frightening, and even more interesting. One week before we saw ""S of the V,"" we watched ""Nosferatu"" with the organ track. The avant-garde soundtrack sometimes seemed to mock the film, but I think I'll give it another go.
The night before we saw ""S of the V,"" we watched ""Nosferatu"" again, this time listening to the audio commentary. The commentator's analysis was fascinating, to say the least! If only the he had delivered his information with the same exuberant gusto that Hutter exhibited in the movie!

1780179,5,B00006JDSI,"Based on the classic novel DRACULA by Bram Stoker, NOSFERATU was the unofficial adaptation that was almost lost forever due to the efforts of Florence Stoker who won a legal case when the producers of the film failed to get official clearance from the Stoker estate to adapt the classic novel. Thankfully, the movie was preserved & stood the test of time. NOSFERATU stands as one of the most remarkable achievements in cinematic history. F. W. Murnau created a hauntingly eerie yet beautiful film. Max Schreck's interpretation of Count Orlock is one of the most horrific creatures in horror film history. He does not portray a charming, handsome, seductive vampire that horror fans came to associate with. He portrays the vampire as an evil, sinister creature of hell, a living embodiment of disease & decay. His vampire looks like a human bat, not the suave, erotic vampire popularized by Christopher Lee.
The movie itself is a triumph of light & shadow to convey the atmosphere of horror. It is made even more haunting by the fact that the movie is a SILENT MOVIE. It's like watching a nightmare.

When you watch this film you will notice the devices that other film makers have stolen, and even with modern technology at their disposal, have used to lesser effect. Now, if you prefer to have your films spoon fed to you, and your imagination is not up to the task, then don't watch this film. to those of you who are able to dive totally into ""suspension of disbelief"" you will come to the same conclusion as countless others: This is the best Vampire film ever made.",978652800,,715,4.682539682539683

The print that was used was pretty clear and I found it not quite as dark as the previous version on laser disc was. I also like the intertitles  and the original tints. If you wish to listen to a new 5.0 audio track there is a new score that really adds some additional chills. And last but definately not least there are some additional supplementary extras that add some more history to the making of the film {although I would have liked to have had more information on the actor who portrayed Nosferatu-Max Shreck}! I thoroughly enjoy watching this film and never tire of it. I recommend this film wholeheartedly.",978393600,,787,4.744525547445256
1780182,5,B00006JDSI,"I have to agree with what another viewer wrote and say that what I believe made this such a scary film comes from our childhood fears. Watching this movie late at night and alone. I cannot tell you how wrapped up in the musical soundtract as well as the ""dark"" photography I got. It was incredible and some of the scenes are just sooooo well done. When the Harker character seeks out the coffin of the vampire and sees count Orlok peering out of a crack in the coffin it is positively freightening. Another incredible scene is later on the ship when a crew member goes below to destroy the count. He starts hacking at the cargo and out comes the rats after he busts a hole in the crate and straight as a pole rises count orlok out of his coffin. The counts rat like appearance, long finger nails and huntch back gives him a most gruesome look. He reminds me of the perverted lurker on a street corner who snatches children. As another viewer put it,he offers the audiance ""dangerous candy"" that is difficult to resist. It is the first film in years to give me nightmares.

Even though it is a silent film, the organ music is captivating and some of the scenes leave you spellbound! It was definitely a spinoff of Dracula. Having seen that 1931 classic, I was able to keep up with Nosferatu even better.
Too bad this movie didn't have sound. Some scenes were really creepy, particulary Orlok emerging from his coffin in the bowels of the ship, coming out of the hold amid the sea of rats, and sneaking to the old home he purchased, carrying his coffin.
This was my first silent film to ever watch, and I wasn't disappointed. Count Orlok's look was genuinely creepy, to say the least. And how fitting that the actor who portrayed the count had the last name of Schreck.
Wonderful effort, considering it was 1922. Saving this film, even though it was clearly plagarism, preserves the history and genre of the early horror films. A must see for horror movie buffs!",974246400,,1016,4.4972972972972975
1780184,5,B00006JDSI,"F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" remains the greatest of all vampire movies. It is a haunting, visually stunning experience and one of first true visual masterpieces in the history of film. Max Schreck is the best vampire I have ever seen in a movie because unlike the usual Draculas (well, here for copyright reasons it's Count Orlock), his is scary as hell. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like a sissy! Murnau presents some of the most haunting and hypnotic gothic images ever filmed and his story rarely needs the typical title card where the dialogue appears because just by looking, we know what's going on, we are drawn in and captured. It remains a creepy little gem. The only movie to even come near its effect is Werner Herzog's 1979 color remake. Murnau's film is an example of true art in the cinema, of real storytelling and building of atmosphere through sheer images. When film historians and critics look back at the beginnings of filmmaking, ""Nosferatu"" will forever be mentioned. It ranks among ""M,"" ""The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari"" and ""Metropolis"" as one of the great German works, and among all movies is a giant.

The tinting and sharpness of the print makes this a silent film treasure to enjoy. The audio commentary is also very helpful for the film student.

It so eloquently expresses what Bram Stoker  wrote into his novel. Fear, paranoia, mystery, and intrigue. Schreck's  performance of the hideously gruesome Count Orlok will forever leave an  indeilble imprint in my mind. Furthermore, the use of lighting and early  special-effects add incredible atomsphere and wonder to the viewer. All in  all, the film plays with the viewer's psyche.

Max Schreck is just as scary as i  said in the last review, plus the movie overall is kinda creepy.  Another  thing is this movie isn't ruled by christianity like Dracula.  Renfield is  always an enjoyable character, in this or Dracula.  I could just go on and  on about subtleties, but, well, i don't even know why i'm reviewing this.

1780189,5,B00006JDSI,"Out of all the films made 'around' the vampire legend, this remains the best. Max Schreck is just about the ugliest version of any vampire, but he is different, he has the fangs in front of his mouth instead of on the  sides, he has a rodent-like face with pointed ears and bushy eyebrows, and  those creepy claws..., he is the real embodiment of evil, a man who 'lives  with the curse' of immortality, having to feed on the blood of the living.  We can really feel his suffering, but he also seems animal-like, a man who  wouldn't hesitate to kill you, but would scare the hell out of you just  seconds before he sank his bloody fangs into your neck. The film is also a  miracle of set decoration, the Gothic settings and the chaotic imagery add  to the creepy atmosphere. The film is also more potent because of it being  silent, somehow the fact that the actors can't scream make you feel trapped  and give you goosebumps just thinking about it. There are some geniunely  scary sequences, but not like today's horror movies, where shadows pop out  of nowhere and scare you. This movie 'frightens' you, Nosferatu attacks  slowly, in a hypnotizing way. F.W. Murnau was a genius, he knew just how to  create the right mood, and make us feel diverse emotions just with images,  no sound, music or dialogue. 'Nosferatu' remains a valuable film, and  remains one of the most effective of the silent era, a timeless  masterpiece. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!",962236800,,1469,4.524714828897339

No one, even Bela Lugosi, ever made Dracula as  skin-crawlingly horrifying as this one, with his unnaturally elongated  features and menacing manner.

""Nosferatu"" is the absolute scariest film in the history of cinema. Now I am not talking about  that remake, because that wasn't a very good remake... I am referring to  the original 1922 cinematic masterpiece that is virtually a nightmare  caught on film. Count Orlock is the scariest monster of all time, because  no one knows anything about Max Schreck, who is the actor who played him.  All anyone knows is when he was born, when he died and that he was in  ""Nosferatu"". He looks pure evil with his ugly bald head, old 18th  century jacket, stunning black eye brows, and talon like fingers and he  really looks dead. This movie was made in 1922, so the picture is a creepy  black and white with that old film grain gracing the screen which makes the  film look really old. Knowing that all the actors in the film are dead now,  makes them come alive again scaring you from beyond the grave as they  appear on your television screen. This film is to be watch at midnight on a  Saturday night... turn off all the lights and turn this film on and don't  turn it off untill it's compleatly over or it will spoil the expiriance of  taking you back to a time where they relied little on special effects and  more make up and really great acting.",959990400,,1357,4.325396825396825

The vampire in this movie literally gives you chills just looking at him.  His  appearance is extremely atypical, compared to stereotyped vampires out  there these days.
I'm not a horror movie fan, but I highly recommend this  one.  It banks heavily on basic emotional impact and little on special  effects and the bells and whistles that many modern film makers dish out  and that many viewers expect.
Viewing this movie is a visceral  experience.  One you are not soon going to forget.

1780216,5,B00006JDSI,"Directed by F.W. Murnau, the original, superbly loathsome German version of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA is a concenrated essay in horror fantasy, full of weird, macabre camera effects.  Though ludicrous at times (every horror film seems to become rather absurd after the passage of years - yet the horror remains), this first important film of the Vampire genre has more spectral atmosphere, more ingenuity, and more imaginative ghoulish ghastiliness than any of its successors.  The movie often seems more closely related to demonic painting than to the later, rather rigid vampire movies.  Henrik Galeen's adaptation of the novel changes the setting from Victorian England to Bremen in 1838.  In the novel, Dracula himself is at first quite old, becoming progessively rejevenated in England by fresh blood; but he's never as grotesque as Schreck in this Murnau version nor as romantically attractive as Langella in the Badham version. The influence of this 1922 silent can be seen in movies such as Bergman's THE MAGICIAN and Goddard's ALPHAVILLE. Surrealistic and Freudian, this version is equally frightening and bizarre.",958867200,,1125,5.375
1780217,5,B00006JDSI,"The earliest, and unauthorized, version of ""Dracula"" is a marvel. Nearly 70 years after it first crept onto movie screens, it is still a riveting piece of cinematic artistry.
I must admit that I find  Max Schreck's vampire much more comical than frightening. At one point in  the film, where he peers out from a ship's galley, he looks like a deranged  elf. The chills in the film really come from the wonderful use of light,  shadow and symbolism. The skeleton clock, ghost ship, fields and Schreck's  ominous profile on the staircase, among others, are all evocative images  that stay with the viewer. The narration, visuals and sets all add to the  eerie atmosphere. Even the little things stand out--check out the cryptic  symbols on Renfield's letter and the black-hooded carriage horses on  Dracula's coach.
Among the actors, Gustav von Wangenheim stood out for  me. As the overconfident and terrorized Jonothan (sic) Harker, Wangenheim  gave a gripping performance.
'Nosferatu' is a wonderful reminder that  the simple things--light, shadow and story--can knock the stuffing out of  hi-tech hocus-pocus.",958780800,,1110,5.203389830508475

1780219,4,B00006JDSI,"The earliest version of ""Nosferatu"" is a wonder to see. It is silent and somewhat broadly acted, but the sets and soundtrack are wonderful, which seems to make the film more melodramatic (and more like a  work of art than a film). It is hardly scary, and sometimes humorous. But  it is an undeniable classic that demands serious attention. Nosferatu was  certainly scary in its time, and not the least by Max Shreck's bald head  and bat ears. I do not feel it right to have physical appearances reveal  someone's true character, but it actually helps the film!
One problem to  watch out for is that is almost always daylight. Dracula sleeps during the  day, and it is better to be familiar with the story before seeing this  film, because it will save much if not all confusion in that area.
All in  all, this Dracula film is almost completely unlike any other Draculas and  is highly recommended for classic film buffs.",956966400,,920,4.6234567901234565

Schreck is wonderful as the rodent-like vampire who is definitely more like  the beast Stoker's book described than any of the film versions that came  later.  The film moves along great and the whole cast is strong.  The  strongest visuals of this film are the scene of the vampire on the top deck  of the ship, the elongated shadow creeping up the stairs and the best of  all is when he tilts straight up in the cargo hold, that one is till eerie  today.

1780235,5,B00006JDSI,"We are lucky to see ""Nosferatu""; All copies were to be destroyed in 1923. ""Nosferatu"" was the product of plagerism, and an unlawful and (at the time) uncredited movie version of Bram Stoker's  ""Dracula"". Stoker's widow sued the movie producers, they went out  of business and the court ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed.  Fortunately for us, copies were moused away and it is from these reels that  we can see, what is considered the first horror film.
Nosferatu's  horrific reputation is unchanged today; The sight of the vampire (Max  Schreck) is every bit as grotesque now as it's ever been. The story is  familiar Dracula, however the genesis of German film expressionism is  clearly engrained; Nosferatu was one of a handful of films that changed the  industry and made people think in ways that were never explored  before.
The music score of this DVD is wonderful pipe-organ music  composed from many early-19th century compositions. It's crafting  completely compliments the story and adds not only tonal accuracy, but also  a believable thread that brings us closer to the time of the film's  creation.
But the unexpected hit of this DVD is the audio commentary  track from Lokke Heiss, and expert on German films. Heiss's commentary is  absolutely compelling and points out many similarities that the average  viewer wouldn't easily pick out. In fact, I would recommend watching the  movie with the organ score, and immediately watching it with the commentary  so ""see"" all the parts you may have initially missed.
The DVD  transfer is about as good as you can get, understanding that it all came  from smuggled copies. The film is also 're-tinted', a film technique that  provides different exposure colors to express changes is daytime or  location.

I can only imagine how terrified  those people who were lucky enough to be amongst the first to see this  movie were.

1780239,5,B00006JDSI,"After eight decades, this movie does more than hold its own. Murnau's direction brings out every single element of eeriness. But the horror is all suggestive and the evil represented through use of shadows which  amplify the effect.  Schreck's vampire is archetypal not because Tobe  Hooper's Salem's Lot tipped its hat to it but because it exemplifies all  that the Universal and Hammer representations were not. Gone are the  overtly erotic, suave and debonair trappings of the black cape and v-shaped  hairline, enter the truly demonic, satanic look which Bram Stoker had  envisioned.  Bran Castle is equally decrepit. But you can tell that the  ruins are genuine and not some prefabrication of a studio team. The archaic  crags and convoluted layout of the vampire's residence is augmented by the  direction all the way through the first 1/3rd to 1/2 of the film.  The 63  minute version (it may say 80 minute on the outside jacket) is the original  one and it's chock full of shudders. The important thing to do is to forget  about the academics of the movie (like Harker's being representative of the  young Aryan being sent to his doom)and sit back and let its imagery spill  all over you. You have to watch this about twice to 3 three times before  the true significance of this first Dracula adaptation can sink in with  you. Future versions can't hold a candle to it (except for Herzog's 1979  remake).  My only gripe would be with von Wangenheim's portrayal of  Harker (Hutter) as he is never really vampirised in the 2nd half of the  film. I'd say the best way to discover this movie is on your own. Don't  listen to anyone before you see it otherwise you may end up with false  expectations. It's a great film but you need to find that out on your own.  I'm only writing this to guide prospective takers on the correctness of  their choice.  Save watching it for late night weekend viewing because  it really has the potential to haunt you. The fact that it's a silent adds  to the terror in that the characters are deadened by a grainy,  shadow-poisoned, black-and-white bubble.  Well worth it on all counts,  especially for generation Xers to stumble upon. Our great-grandparents'  generation had it sussed with scare cinema.",943228800,,2240,4.762402088772846

Murnau (who also directed SUNRISE {1927}).  David Sheppard  once again does a fine job of restoring a fine film.  The transfer on  this film is quite good, considering the fact that the movie is over 70  years old.  Sheppard has also included an interesting commentary that  proves to be enjoyable and insightful.  Don't miss this disc!",916012800,,490,4.962962962962963

7970062,5,B00006JDSI,"I've watched this film no telling how many times since I was a kid. I'm old now and still love it. What Marnau did with such little technology available to him is remarkable to say the least. Even by today's standards, this is a haunting tale that doesn't need lot of CGI or other special effects and shows just what can be done with film without them. I love silent movies and this one is my favorite.",1517788800,,402,4.233766233766234
