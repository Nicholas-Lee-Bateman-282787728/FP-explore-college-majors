536227,5,6303032532,"I feel fortunate to have seen this movie and I wish I had known about it years earlier.  I have earlier heard about Raoul Wallenberg as a person who disappeared into the Stalin Soviet political prison system, but I knew little else.  It is apparently still a mystery as to why he must have been a threat to Stalin unless Stalin presumed that Wallenberg would have remained in Hungary and agitated against the impending communist state.  Regardless, Wallenberg's exploits to ultimately save thousands of Jews from extermination by fanatical Nazi's and Hungarian fascists is a story worth retelling.

What is most poignant about the story is that Wallenberg is presented as a very average person, but a person witnessing atrocities in German held territories.  For most of the war, he was like the many thousands who too knew of the genocide and did nothing.  But, for his own reasons, he chose to become involved.  His role was relatively short (less than a year) and it could have been a complete failure.  In fact, he did greatly succeed according to not only this movie, but in many other accounts of his actions.  But, his success was less the story than his unselfish efforts.  Unlike the majority who remained blissfully ignorant, he had enough self-awareness so as to judge himself unfavorably for life if he did not act.  To me that is the real lesson, what did this story tell me about myself and what all of us should do when we see injustice?

It is true that the movie did not focus as much on his many achievements, but the film makers decided to keep the film within two hours and to increase the drama by alluding to the triumphs and viewing him in moments of dire consequences and severe spiritual strain.  He witnessed children murdered and we could empathize with his helplessness.  The film presents these death scenes matter-of-factly as Wallenberg looks at the survivors who until that moment saw him as a mythical character who could stop all such killings.  Wallenberg was often able to escape for his safety, but stayed.  Would any of us have done the same?  I hope that I would have, but I can never know.  I only hope that whatever he finally faced in Soviet prison, he knew an internal peace of having done more than he ever thought possible of himself.  Please see this movie and show it to your children to keep these lessons alive.",1099612800,103,2360,4.670702179176756
536228,5,6303032532,"This is a dark and realistic film about how Wallenberg wanted to save defenseless men, women and children. I think that the selection of Wallenberg for the job amongst a group of Jewish leaders was rather heart gripping. The leaders referred to his papers saying his diplomas weren't that great and job history wasn't of that kind that would make him a first choice for the job. But, Wallenberg kept on saying; - You don't understand. I HAVE DECIDED THAT I AM GOING TO DO THIS JOB.

In Budapest he did what he could to save Jews of all ages. The viewer is also allowed to witness how it becomes increasingly harder to save people.

In this film you are made to face the brutal facts of what that happened during World War II. The film stays with you. Still, I normally watch films that I like many times, but with this one I haven't been able to do so.

Even so, I cannot forget what I saw.",1092009600,95,890,4.285714285714286

536230,5,6303032532,I disagree with the previous reviewers.  This movie was far better than Schlinder's List.  For me it was  more emotionally moving than Spielberg's List.  In fact as far as I am concerned it makes  Spielberg look like an amature.  I also think Spielberg may have stolen the little girl's red coat idea from this movie.  After seeing this movie I was so turned on that I checked out 2 biographies of Wallenberg from the library.  The movie was very faithful to the biographies.,1012003200,27,475,4.63855421686747
536231,5,6303032532,"Ignore the following review. I almost didn't buy this movie because of those horrid comments. But my intuition told me that I still should, and I am glad that I did. Raoul Wallenberg was NOT brooding and ineffectual in  this movie, but rather was a heroic, caring, motivated man who did all he  could to help many of the Jews of the Budapest ghetto. His character in  this movie can easily be compared to that of Oskar Schindler in Schindler's  List. I did NOT notice any significantly inexplicable flashbacks, abrupt  transitions or dark picture that the following reviewer complained about. I  agree with the last reviewer that this movie is not as emotional as  Schindler's List, and certainly is not quite as well-done, but is still  among the best holocaust movies that I've seen.",954115200,45,785,4.8059701492537314
536232,1,6303032532,"No viewer of this drab, offensive film should imagine that it is an accurate account of the exploits of one of the great heros of World War II.  Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat and businessman, undertook in 1944 to thwart Hitler and Adolph Eichmann in their plan to kill the remaining Jews of Budapest.  He saved some 30,000 from death in the concentration camps. ""By contemporary accounts, the real Raoul Wallenberg was a forceful, decisive, clever, and handsome man who saved lives by diplomatic and other means.  In addition to issuing Swedish passports and other papers to those at risk in wartime Budapest, he employed intrigue, confrontation, and bribes.  He also supported soup kitchens, houses, and hospitals that helped Jews survive.  He had great spiritual strength. ""But in the movie, Wallenberg is an anti-hero--brooding, ineffectual, almost trivial--frequently standing by helplessly while Jews are slaughtered.  In addition, the film is dark and hard to follow, with jerky, abrupt transition between scenes and sometimes inexplicable flashbacks. ""There are many books in print describing Wallenberg's heroism.  I Werbell and Thurston Clarke.  (""Mystery"" refers to the fact that the Soviets took Wallenberg prisoner at war's end.  He disappeared into their prison system and is presumed dead.)""",936489600,23,1312,5.455445544554456

I kept wondering WHERE we are, WHAT we are doing, HOW we are doing it.  Wallenberg saved thousands of Jews; yet this film basically shows very little of that but only shows him watching them get beaten and slaughtered.  A little more dialog would have helped.

""Wallenberg:  A Hero's Story"" is so much better and makes the grand story more clear.",1444435200,,581,4.485714285714286

Mr. Wallenberg kept showing up everywhere with his bag and I guess we are supposed to think it contained loads of money??  He had no real facial expressions, and seemed to always be thinking of something else other than the immediate situation.  This movie was compared to 'Schindler's List"" in another review - that is a huge stretch and not deserved.

Real life hero whose reward was internment by the Soviets.

There is no way to completely show the reality tho. I  found the film to be good. I do not think all films need to be high tech to be good. I believe the filming showed the focus of the lifeto save as many Jews in a city where hell was being unleashed in unbelievable ways. God bless Wallenberg and every person who did the right thing. God bless them for showing us the lives of others are more important their our own.  I do not believe my words can convey the dynamic actions of Wallenberg.

536425,5,6303032532,"Raoul Wallenberg is one of the righteous Gentiles, who was willing to risk everything for the sake of standing up to Nazi atrocities. What makes his story truly remarkable is the fact that he was just an ordinary person, not even a very high ranking officer in the Swedish diplomatic corps, but who used whatever leverage he had to provide safe passage to persecuted Jews in WWII Hungary. At the beginning of the movie, we see how the Jews view him as an invincible savior, but this later changes as they come to realize the reality of the situation, that it is by his pure force of will and character that he does what he does to save them. It is a hard movie to watch as we see Wallenberg continually come up against one obstacle after another in trying to save as many Jews as possible. On the other hand, we witness the glee with which the Hungarian Arrow Cross execute hapless Jews, men, women and even children.

The Hungarian civilian population is also depicted as willing participants in the atrocities committed against the Jews, egging on the execution squad as they mow down innocents. Stellan Skarskard's portrayal of Wallenberg was somber and effective, his pain and frustration at not being able to do more is clearly evident throughout the film. Yes, there are better adaptations out there, even better Holocaust movies, but this one is worth watching too. It helps us understand better the man that was Raoul Wallenberg, a hero of the Holocaust who survives the Nazis, only to fall victim to Stalin's regime.",1389484800,3,1525,4.711610486891386

It's cinematography is bleak and drab, I'm sure much like the time and place it portrays.  It is also oh so highly philosophical as most European films are.  We never truly feel the horror of the Holocaust in this film as it was, because the filmmaker never fully engages the audience.  The motivations of Raoul Wallenberg are never clearly defined here and it's difficult to track any character development.  I believe it would have helped if we knew more about the characters' backgrounds in order to produce a better sense of empathy.  I would also liked to have seen more of what happened (or at least what's speculated) to Wallenberg after he left Hungary.

It is quite violent and lacks redeeming hope. You don't get to enjoy the success stories that he experienced in his early days of rescuing people. Everyone Wallenberg sets out to save is murdered before his eyes. There is also uneccesary nudity displayed by a character who is supposed to be mentally ill. This continues through out the film.

536477,3,6303032532,"Kjell Grede's ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg"" is a noble but ultimately flawed effort.  The story focuses on the efforts of Raoul Wallenberg to save Jews in Budapest during WWII's final days.  Although he comes from one of Sweden's wealthiest families, there's nothing outstanding about Raoul.  He's an ordinary guy with ordinary talents who hasn't done anything remarkable; as the film begins, he's an importer of luxury foods.  But on a train trip, he happens to see Jewish corpses being tossed out of a death camp-bound freight car, and a father, who jumped out of the car to be with his dead son, shot and killed.  This experience changes Raoul's life.  As he tells the skeptical committee considering him for relief work, it's only in that moment that he feels he's ever actually lived.

Grede's film focuses on the very last days of Wallenberg's Hungarian mission:  the exhausting scramble to bribe German and Hungarian officials, racing against the clock to try to save the Jewish ghetto, a dramatic standoff with a Hungarian fascist, despair alternating with hope, and finally Wallenberg's mysterious disappearance into the Soviet Union.

The best moments of the film are when Stellan Skarsgard (Wallenberg) and Katharina Thalberg (Marja) are on-screen.  Thalberg is especially good as the Jewish woman whose children have been killed and who refuses to wear anything but a man's overcoat because, when the Germans come to kill her, she wants them to see her naked, as a real person rather than a statistic.  Skarsgard, whose acting style is low-key anyway, plays Wallenberg with a subdued intensity that seems just right.

But ultimately, neither Skarsgard nor Thalberg can save the film.  The writing tends at times to be melodramatic--ruining, for example, the final confrontation between Wallenberg and the Hungarian fascist.  There's too little exposure of Wallenberg's interior, so his motives for risking life and limb to save Jews remain a bit cloudy (despite the ""It's only in that moment that I've lived"" scene).

Still, the film is worth seeing.  It highlights the remarkable efforts of Wallenberg, and it underscores the fact--so easy to forget in our rather cynical age--that every life, no matter how ""insignificant,"" is worth superhuman efforts to save.",1216080000,10,2275,5.191780821917808

Grede does not shy from depicting Nazi abominations, and the air of suspense he builds around the discovery of a group of survivors, and the march of the Russian army on Budapest, is unnerving.

536513,5,6303032532,"Raoul Wallenberg is a prototypical hero of our times.  His extraordinary expression of altruism immediately preceeds the activist of our post-modern era, and stands as a shining example. He was unquestionably one of the greatest men of his day, and living proof that activism is perhaps the highest form of spiritual activity to which one can aspire in the contemporary world.  Perhaps there is another film about Raoul Wallenberg. If so, I am not aware of it, and that there is such a fine film about this relatively little known giant (especially for younger generations and many non-Europeans)in itself gives this film value.
Further, the film is well-acted, well-made. There are a number aspects that I particularly like.  The film works well within a limited budget. The cinematography (the shooting, editing, etc.) is excellent.  The film is quite staged - much in the tradition of the French Existentialist Theatre of Beckett, Artaud, Jarre, and much against the realist trend which really takes off in the 1970's in the wake of Hitchcock, Bresson, Peckinpaw, and many others. Waiting for Eichmann feels like Waiting for Godot. The script has this theatrical feel, as well.  The film starts very slowly and builds through a series of powerful siloquies and dialogs. As contrarian as the whole production is in this sense, it works quite well within the context which was highly existential. The film is thus more thought provoking than sensationally provocative, which seems to have been lost on a number of reviewers.  The Absurdity plays as much a role in the turning of events as the obvious Brutality, with which we are all unfortunately familiar.
In my opinion, the two most affecting scenes: A little boy wearing the Star of David emerges from hiding and is held at gunpoint by a huge battalion of Nazis.  The climax where Wallenberg confronts the SS officer in charge of the annihilation of tens of thousands, and stops him from fulfilling his orders by bringing him face to face with his own humanity, as they share an umbrella in the rain. Thus, the secret of successful non-violent activism is revealed - a great scene, worth far, far more than the pittance the film is selling for these days.",1181174400,5,2210,4.940700808625337
536514,5,6303032532,"Raoul Wallenberg is one of the righteous Gentiles, who was willing to risk everything for the sake of standing up to Nazi atrocities. What makes his story truly remarkable is the fact that he was just an ordinary person, not even a very high ranking officer in the Swedish diplomatic corps, but who used whatever leverage he had to provide safe passage to persecuted Jews in WWII Hungary. At the beginning of the movie, we see how the Jews view him as an invincible saviour, but this later changes as they come to realise the reality of the situation, that it is by his pure force of will and character that he does what he does to save them. It is a hard movie to watch as we see Wallenberg continually come up against one obstacle after another in trying to save as many Jews as possible. On the other hand, we witness the glee with which the Hungarian Arrow Cross execute hapless Jews, men, women and even children. The Hungarian civilian population is also depicted as willing participants in the atrocities committed against the Jews, egging on the execution squad as they mow down innocents. Stellan Skarskard's portrayal of Wallenberg was somber and effective, his pain & frustration at not being able to do more is clearly evident throughout the film. Yes, there are better adaptations out there, even better Holocaust movies, but this one is worth watching too. It helps us understand better the man that was Raoul Wallenberg, a hero of the Holocaust who survives the Nazis, only to fall victim to Stalin's regime.",1178496000,11,1523,4.707865168539326
536515,1,6303032532,"I am extremely interested in heroic tales of the Holocaust Era. Though this film is good from the informational aspect, it is just plain dull viewing. The life of Wallenberg would best be suited to more skillful hands than those who directed and produced this one. Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgaard (THE OX) never comes to life at any time as the defiant diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. An earlier made-for-TV version of WALLENBERG was far superior in all ways. Too bad it has never been released to tape to my knowledge.

For those interested in the Hungarian-Jewish slaughter of WW2,I would recommend MUSIC BOX or SUNSHINE.Though these films do not specifically address the 65,000 Jews of the Budapest ghetto,THESE films are at least engrossing and DO communicate the atrocities to some degree that occured in Hungary in a much more engaging  and compelling way for the screen.",1168732800,8,873,5.0137931034482754
536516,3,6303032532,"Yea, I would say so, when compared to Schindler list. Schindler List is better. Sometimes it seems, that the movie is loosing the action and is ""standing"" at one same point without any action progress. It seems that the author didn't know what to do next, so the action stills so you get bored soon. The good feature is the multilanguage version of the movie and there are of course several very strong scenes, but over all I would recomend this movie only to those, who are a really great fans to WW2 history & events. Anyway buy Schindler List or, if you want to see any documentary, so very strong movie is the Strangers of Arms.",1155081600,3,632,4.410256410256411
536517,5,6303032532,"Before us appear the last months of World War II in Budapest, presenting the monumental role of Raoul Wallenberg in saving the city's Jews with remarkable success.  The story of Wallenberg and his tireless efforts is depicted with honest reality, conveying how selflessly he worked to save those who could not save themselves.  By others, he was seen as a man of mediocrity adding nothing to the fame of his notable Swedish family of industry and finance.  His unremarkable life caused many to doubt his suitability to rescue Jews in Central Europe.  And yet, he went on to prove his doubters very wrong exhibiting anything but mediocrity as he devoted all his time, energy and resources to rescuing Jews in Budapest from trains that would have led to certain death.  The film depicts his resourcefulness at devising new plans when previous methods of rescue no longer succeed.  One cannot but be amazed at the gall he exhibited in approaching the Nazi general in command to avert the annihilation of the Jewish ghetto of Budapest, thereby saving 65,000 lives in addition to the some 35,000 lives he protected in safe houses disguised as Swedish government buildings.  If these figures are accurate, Wallenberg is responsible for the saving of most of the Jews of Budapest who survived the war.  Over and over, we see how he forwent his own comfort and needs in order to save one more life or make one more person's life a little easier.  He never thought twice of putting his own life in danger to save another's.  How tragic then his own disappearance at the close of the war, when the perceived danger had passed.  He was taken by the Russians under the pretext of meeting with the newly established Hungarian government heads only to be taken to Russia never to be heard from again.  While we may never know the fate of this most extraordinary hero, we have much to learn from his example of selfless love for one's neighbor.  He made the ultimate sacrifice for humanity giving up his freedom and in all likelihood his life.  This film offers a very tasteful recounting of his heroic efforts during the war and being filmed in Swedish, Hungarian and German adds to its authenticity.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone wishing to learn about Raoul Wallenberg and the role he played in saving Budapest's Jews during World War II.",1150070400,31,2342,4.762376237623762

536519,4,6303032532,"Why do we watch films?  Initially in the early days it was part escapism, part to be wowed, part to see what one couldn't realistically travel to see.  Nowadays, it is all too often simply for entertainment.  Mind you, all films are not unworthy of watching, but far too few are ""moving"" in an emotional sense.  ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg"" is one such film that certainly is ""worthy of watching"" (to utilize Akira Kurosawa's phrase).  Maybe you are one who goes to the cinema to kill time, see what's being talked about and such, and/or who rents/buys DVDs for similar reasons.  If so, all the power to you. I'm not a killjoy, after all; but with television providing the same fare, why not (at least sometimes) seek something different from the amazing breadth of motion pictures that is available to one?  This film about Mr. Wallenberg is instructive herein.  In it we are almost literally transported to World War Two Budapest (without seeing much of that beautiful city actually being beside the point).  Stalin was right: a million deaths is a statistic.  It is something almost impossible to fathom without great effort.  But an individual's death can be understood, in contradistinction.  That's why it's helpful thinking of the Holocaust not as a 6 million death event; but rather as the brutal murder of single family (of 2, 3, 5, 7 people) in cold blood---multiplied by a factor of 1, 2, or 3 million (depending on what you visualize a family unit's size to be).  That's why this film is relevent.  In it we see individuals whose lives hang in the balance as the actor portraying the real-life Swedish hero, Raoul Wallenberg, goes about trying to protect those at the mercy of Fascist forces.  No, this film isn't epic in its particulars---we don't see a lot of events and such---but we do see several events of a personal nature.  Some may call that boring; but it is, instead, more harrowing & educational, especially if one can make that leap and imagine what one is seeing is, in fact, being played out exponentially, simultaniously.  I can't help but think of the film Saving Private Ryan"" in this context; for in that film we barely knew who Tom Hanks was supposed to be fighting against.  Yes, it was the Germans, but Hitler and the Nazi totalitarian state didn't seem to figure into the equation that much; being eclipsed by the story of some soldiers fighting simply to reach---& ""save"" (for that soldier's family) one private by the name of Ryan.  Sure, it's a well made film and all that, but it hardly speaks volumes in comparison to a film such as ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg.""  Do view it, if you get the opportunity to do so.  Do also see ""The Wannsee Conference,"" a German film about a meeting of Nazi leadership concerning Jews in Europe.  And read ""Babi Yar,"" a great book about life in Ukraine as the Nazis invade and occupy it---that is, if you have an intellectual interest about such things.  If so, maybe my ""So You'd like to Viscerally Experience World War Two"" Amazon list might be of interest to you for more suggestions (accessible by clicking on my name and thence onto my ""So You'd Like to"" lists.)

7834847,1,6303032532,"One the funniest films I've seen in quite some time. I know, it was supposed to be dark and continue the endless barrage of anti-German propaganda, but the plot is ridiculously and laughably-inaccurate.
Adolph Eichmann was actually one of the German officials in charge of the TRANSFER AGREEMENT/FINAL SOLUTION. In other words, when the German government was no longer willing to deal with the plethora of pro-communist jews that had flooded Germany between the end of WWI and the lead-up to WWII, they decided to financially assist said jews in moving to whatever country they wished. Yes, that's the dreaded ""Final Solution"" -- a transfer agreement in which German, Austrian, Czech, etc jews could be assisted by the German government in moving to literally ANY country they wanted to. ...and Eichmann was one the most important officials in charge of its record keeping and coordination.
Yet here we have a film painting Eichmann as some sort of fictional ""jew hunter."" And this film was not only needlessly drab, dark and overly-grim, it came-off every bit as cheap as it was inauthentic.
