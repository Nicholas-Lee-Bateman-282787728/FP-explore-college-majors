Outstanding DVD. I will be buying more of his books and DVD's and highly recommend anyone interested in improving gun handling skills doing the same.

8551273,5,B00AG6NLG8,"Very happy with DVD.  The content is unbelievably valuable.  This is what I was looking for as I am just starting Defensive Handgun Training.  This is not an average training video.  Mike Seeklander goes the extra mile and explains why certain techniques are better than others.  I found myself rewinding the DVD almost all the time because there is so much great but subtle information I wanted to make sure I absorbed it before I went forward.  If you carry a weapon, training is a must and this is the type of training you need.  It teaches you how to train.  Just bought it but this will change everything I do at the range.  I highly recommend this training program.  I believe there is at least two days of information packed into this 70 minute DVD.",1364169600,6,756,4.492647058823529
