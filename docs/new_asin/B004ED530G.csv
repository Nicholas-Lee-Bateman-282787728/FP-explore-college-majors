4336548,4,B004ED530G,"MESRINE: THE KILLER INSTINCT

A French film starring Vincent Cassel, Gerard Depardieu, Cecile De France, Elena Anaya, Gilles Lellouch & Ludivine Sagnier. It tells the tale of the man considered to be the head of France's Bonnie & Clyde. There are lots of hardnosed men & lovely ladies in this one.

The movie skips forward all on its own & sometimes disturbing so but as it deals with a career that is known as fact in journal's & in fable through story perhaps that was unavoidable. Beginning with Mesrine's maturing during the existence of the Algerian Liberation Front & continuing through the Baader/Meinhoff Gang in Germany we're introduced to a character that loved to rob banks, consider himself a revolutionary (though he wasn't), kidnap the wealthy & get caught.

He bragged that no prison could him & he was right. Doing time on two continents & getting a special security classification of prison closed down in Canada. I was as surprised at the ineptness of Mesrine in-between jobs as well as the inept forces trying to corral him.

Nevertheless this was a good movie. It's an enjoyable watch & more than anything a wonderful portrayal by Vincent Cassel. He is Mesrine. Gerard Depardieu plays his crime family father figure which is set against Mesrine's detestation for his own working father. Depardieu's character is very well-done as he seems to admire the young & upcoming killer but is powerless to contain him, as he well knows. The ladies play his various love interests & they do it well. From the love of his life to his well reasoned choice between his work & her, his many mistresses & his soul mate the scenes are touching, intense & alternately casual. One thing is certain; his appetite for danger barely exceeded his appetite for beautiful women.

Violence rules the day here as well as a perplexing personality. It's better than a 3.5 Amazon star movie but not quite 4.0. There is a second Mesrine movie called Public Enemy #1 & he was that. It is somewhat less of a show than Killer Instinct due to writing I feel but Vincent is dead-on as Mesrine again & the role of the women is beefed up in a criminal sense. Ludivine Sagnier returns in her role as Sylvia & plays one of the most lithesome sensual females you'll see on screen. Public Enemy #1 gets 3.5 Amazon stars in my book.",1329609600,5,2310,4.679802955665025
4336549,5,B004ED530G,"Jacques Mesrine pronounced Meyrine became French public enemy no. 1 for good reason. The movie loosely based on Mesrines autobiography `L'Instinct De Mort was filmed in two separate parts, in French with English subtitles. . Mesrine lead a violent life as gangster, bank robber, lover, kidnapper and multiple prison escape artist. DVD Part One (Killer instinct) and DVD Part Two (Public Enemy No. 1) follow Messines criminal exploits over several decades in France and abroad, his growing notoriety and final demise in a police staged ambush in Paris. The French actor Vincent Cassel is Mesrine the `man of a thousand faces', in a career defining role.  Notable heavy weight French actors play close support roles, not least girlfriend Ccile De France and Grard Depardieu in awesome form as `Guido', Mesrines Alma mata in the French underworld. The direction, cinematography and music are a superior mix of Gallic self absorption and sex with a good measure of Hollywood action and sinister violence thrown in for good measure. Although Mesrine isn't the average role model for society he certainly is an interesting subject for this very good hero/anti hero movie. As for Jacques Mesrine the man this movie invites you to be the judge.",1329177600,,1236,5.118811881188119

4336551,5,B004ED530G,We saw Mesrine: Killer Instinct and Public Enemy #1 in the theater and HAD to buy it on blu-ray.  Great movie and incredible true story.,1318118400,2,136,4.44
4336552,5,B004ED530G,"if you saw, black swan & were impressed by the actor who played her dance director in the movie, go no further in your pursuit of catching
this amazing actor in action.vincent cassel also played the cross-dressing french duke in, elizabeth, starring cate blanchett..what you see in
mesrine, killer instinct is a bravura performance of an actor who uses his entire body, much in the style of a kirk douglas, or robert mitchum,
to convey the ebb & flow of reason, cause & effect of circumstance to inflict consequences beyond ordinary control..i highly recommend
both mesrine films..vincent cassel is a new kind of movie star to come out of europe. very gifted & not afraid to use his body as an instrument.",1313193600,10,705,4.786885245901639
4336553,3,B004ED530G,"Gangster and hoodlum films entertain me when done ""right"". This movie is a fine diversion and worth renting or checking out. However, this film did not impress me. I prefered ""Brother"" and the ""Pusher"" trilogy, just as examples. Want a gangster film that's different? Try ""Gangster No. 1"". Takes a bit of getting used to, maybe, but it's unique and in the end...satisfying(?). ""Wild Kingdom"" is also a fine gangster or hoodlum flick.",1309392000,,433,4.945205479452055
4336554,5,B004ED530G,"I tried to order this a few months ago but it was only available on region 2 players,so I thought I would check again and viola it was available(thank's Amazon).This is a great flick,action,great storyline(it is based on true events)and Vincent Cassel what can I say he is excellent! Also,it is dubbed in English(also has an option if you want sub-titles)the dubbing couln't be better in some of these dubbed movies it is sometimes difficult to understand what they are saying not so here! This movie is great,it starts out as Jacques gets out of the french army and is living with his parents and moves on to his beginnings in crime and escapes. Love this movie!",1303257600,4,663,4.6752136752136755
4336555,4,B004ED530G,I really loved both the Mesrine movies. I thought the first part was the best. Cassel is just fantastic as Mesrine and watching him evolve into a criminal is fascinating. Gerard Depardieu is also excellent. There is some brutal violence which is to be expected considering the subject but I recommend this to all film fans.,1302566400,,323,4.785714285714286

4336567,4,B004ED530G,Subtitled movies are not my favorite movies to watch! However with this one for some reason I enjoyed it very much. I would like to think that the movie has not been embellished for cinematic reasons but I am sure it has been. I would love to see this in documentary form!,1402876800,,272,4.25
4336568,2,B004ED530G,"I know this film had all sorts of positive reviews, but for me it bordered on the boring. I guess if you are looking for some grand meaning in here you will find it, but for me, it just didn't cut it.",1382745600,,200,3.7857142857142856
4336569,4,B004ED530G,Made more interesting by the fact that the story is based on a real person. Vincent Cassel is dark and sexy.,1378252800,,108,4.190476190476191

4336571,3,B004ED530G,"To like a film you have to like someone in the film.  This normally falls on the shoulders of the lead actor.  The screenwriter did not give ""Mesrine"" a likeable character, or someone with redeeming social values that we could relate to.

Look at the Godfather saga:  Vito, Sonny, and Michael Corleone were all blood thirsty criminals, but we related to their strong family values and cared what happened to them.

Mesrine was just a despicable character to betrayed his wife and children and his had no real goal in life, other than be a criminal.

Even so, is the story interesting?  No.",1373155200,2,589,4.660194174757281
4336572,4,B004ED530G,"This review is for both Part 1 and 2 as they go together and tell the story in order of Jacques Mesrine, the notorious French criminal who gained noteriety in the 1970s. Very well acted, particularly by Vincent Cassei who also does a fantastic job in ""Le pacte des loups"" and a number of other movies. Also a fascinating and compelling story told without a hint of senitmentality, particularly doing a good job portraying the complexity of an individual capable of both great bravery and charisma but also great cruelty and greed.  Highly recommend if you like movies like Ronin, Heat, Carlitos Way and similar crime dramas.",1368835200,,624,4.831775700934579
4336573,5,B004ED530G,"This is Part 1 of two fascinating and exciting filmizations of Jacques Mesrine's autobiography. He was a real-life master criminal, a hotblooded Frenchman who beat both the penal and judicial systems.  He became a career criminal at a young age; as he tells his father in one scene, it is his choice, it's not his father's fault that he turned out the way he did. Mesrine started his ""career"" with petty thievery, moving up to bank robberies, kidnapping, extortion, and murder. No prison could hold him, and he mocked the judges at his trials. This is a great movie, and you should see this Part 1 first, then the follow-up, Part 2, Public Enemy Number One.",1351814400,,657,4.663793103448276
4336574,5,B004ED530G,"Vincent Cassel burns up the screen as Jacques Mesrine, the lifelong criminal who became a folk hero to the masses in France. Mesrine went from young man and former Algerian soldier to petty thievery, then bank robberies, to murder and mayhem. His mentor Guido, played by Gerard Depardieu, reminded me of a ""Pauly"" like figure from the movie ""Goodfellas."" Great acting by all elevates this movie to greatness, an essential film of the gangster oeuvre.",1349654400,,450,5.013333333333334
4336575,4,B004ED530G,"This 2008 French film based on the autobiographical book L'instinct de mort by French gangster Jacques Mesrine follows the rise of a French gangster's trials and tribulations. The violence is extreme at times and nothing is sacred, especially when he puts a gun in the mouth of his wife to intimidate her into not calling the cops on him and wouldn't you know it? Their little kid is watching. If you can handle that and are open to watching a violent gangster style film then you might like this film.

Gerard Depardieu plays a mob boss. I'd recognize that nose anywhere. Only in France.

The main gangster character is played by Vincent Cassel, who won Best Actor at the Cesar Awards and the Tokyo Film Festival.

Note that there are two parts and this is part one. English subtitles.

8426761,5,B004ED530G,"For those of you who don't mind foreign films with subtitles, this is one hardboiled gangster movie. Vincent Cassel absolutely dominates the screen as the completely crazy, vicious French gangster Jacques Mesrine. The action is continuous and thoroughly believable, violent shootouts, robberies, and most notorious of all, prison escapes, to include getting out of France's toughest prison, La Sante. Gerard Depardieu nearly steals the show as his criminal mentor. Mesrine could put any American gangster to shame in terms of sheer gall and ruthlessness.

Highly recommended to the gangster movie fan.",1510099200,,601,5.604395604395604
