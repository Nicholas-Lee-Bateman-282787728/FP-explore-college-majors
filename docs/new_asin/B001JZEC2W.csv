I really suggest this Great Release.",1298160000,4,203,4.828571428571428
8314060,3,B001JZEC2W,"I LOVE FARRAH FAWCETT...FROM CHARLIES ANGELS UNTIL TODAY AND BEYOND. HOWEVER- THIS IS A TYPICAL FF FLICK WHERE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS HAS HIS EYES GLUED TO HER THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE AND NO NEW GROUND IS BROKEN. IF YOU SAW SILK HOPE OR SUBSTITUTE WIFE- THEN YOU SAW THIS. ITS JUST GOT A DIFFERENT SETTING. ITS KILLING ME TO KNOW MS FAWCETT ISNT DOING WELL AND WE MAY NOT SEE HER IN ANYTHING NEW. SO, THIS APPEARS TO BE A HARD TO GET ITEM. MAYBE YOU SHOULD GRAB IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER IN HER PRIME. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER FARRAH FAWCETT JUST AS THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CAL RIPKEN JR. AS THEY SAY: "" WHEN THEY MADE HER THEY BROKE THE MOLD.""",1242691200,7,680,4.159090909090909
