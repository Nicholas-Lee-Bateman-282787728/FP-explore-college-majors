1872754,3,B00008YLUE,"Of all the comic book heroes translated to film in the form of serials, Mandrake is the most disappointing. He is ""out of uniform"" most of the time, does not wear the pecil thin moustache and any magic, cetainly not ""black"" as announced on the DVD cover, is not used to overcome the bad guys. Not once did he ""gusture hypnotically"" nor did he have a villain project his thoughts onto a wall. Worst of all, Lothar had a full head of hair.
But, if as I do you like serials as a genre, it is a good example of the fare provided for boys and girls on Saturday afternoons 60 - 70 years ago.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mandrake-the-Magician/dp/B00008YLUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mandrake the Magician</a>",1303603200,2,743,5.2

1872756,5,B00008YLUE,"""Mandrake, the Magician""(1939 - 214 minutes - 12 episodes), is one of the classics B&W cinema serials of Columbia, directed by Sam Nelson and Norman Deming. Based on the known Comics created by Lee Falk and Phill Davis in 1924 and written by Joseph F. Poland, Basil Dickey and Ned Dandy. Mandrake (the actor Warren Hull) is a sagacious detective who is traveling in a maritime cruise when he knows the professor Hudson (the actor Forbes Murray), the author of a machine that uses the energy of the radio waves. Developed for the good, the powerful device becomes a dangerous weapon when it falls in the hands of an evil genius known as ""Wasp"". Mandrake and his faithful assistant, Lothar (the actor Al Kikume), will fight Wasp and his gang, living an intensely battle between the good and the evil. The Mandrake's dress style with the black and red layer, ternary and top-hat, had immortalized the figure of the magician. The English word ""Mandrake"" is the name of a root that was always associated with magical powers and miraculous cures. Lothar was an African prince and one of the first black character treated in a serious way in Comic books, he was always considered as an intelligent and loyal ally. With original special effects for that time, the film deserves reverence to the great performance of Warren Hull, that gave life to one of the biggest icons of the Comic books of all times.",1136592000,,1396,4.725409836065574

1872759,3,B00008YLUE,"Okay, I'm going to start this review by admitting that I never liked heroic magicians in fancy suits, top hats, and tails. Even Zatanna, who had great legs, grated on me. So MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN began with a strike against it. On the other hand, it has Warren Hull, who was so excellent in THE SPIDER'S WEB (and pretty good in THE GREEN HORNET STRIKES AGAIN, too). And of course Mandrake himself was created by Lee ""The Phantom"" Falk, so that's a third hand. And if you think that's impossible, well, he IS a magician.

A mysterious arch-criminal known as ""The Wasp"" (he actually wears a rather effeminate silk mask and cape, not a fierce-looking wasp get-up, unfortunately) is after a new invention that can... well, it can do something pretty terrible, I'll bet. Into the fray stumbles Mandrake, who, with his faithful giant African manservant Lothar, foils the various machinations of Mr. Silky Drawers. Only Lothar is, not a muscular ebon giant, but instead a rather doughy guy who looks like a Philippino and dresses like an extra in a Sinbad picture.

I liked the first couple of chapters; Mandrake does a magic trick or two, and occasionally tosses those nifty little smoke capsules and then sprints out of the room, leaving the villains wondering how the heck he did that. It gets tiresome, however, and pretty soon even Mandrake loses interest, tossing the capsules and then just standing there, waiting for the smoke to clear and the fisticuffs to continue. Not long into the serial, the magic angle is completely forgotten, the eveningwear goes in the closet, and for all intents and purposes Mandrake turns into Dick Tracy.

Ultimately, the darn thing is disappointing. A Mandrake serial should have done more with the mystical aspect of the character, even if only having its hero pull bunnies out of his hat to throw at the villains. It runs out of steam midway through, and - although at 12 chapters, it's the shortest of the 57 Columbia chapterplays - becomes rather tedious in the second half. Co-directors Sam Nelson and Norman Deming did one more serial together (OVERLAND WITH KIT CARSON) and then Columbia dumped them and handed over the serial reins to James W. Horne, who directed the next ten Columbia serials all by his lonesome.

VCI's DVD is good, not great. Some of the soundtrack of chapter one has decayed over the years, and voices were overdubbed for the DVD release, but if you cared about stuff like that, you wouldn't have read this far into the review anyway. Bonuses include a poster gallery, biographies, and serial trailers.",1100390400,31,2564,4.820454545454545
1872760,4,B00008YLUE,"Columbia's cliffhangers tend to be campy or silly by serial standards, but this early effort (1939) is a very enjoyable adventure. The personable Warren Hull is excellent in the title role. Movie buffs will recognize many of the cast members from Columbia's ""B"" pictures and Three Stooges movies. Slick production and good direction by Sam Nelson and Norman Deming (who were usually assistant directors) push this one head and shoulders above the general run of Columbia serials. (Watch for a beautifully staged wrap-up in the last chapter, when the masked villain finally gets his!) A note about this video edition: the soundtrack of Chapter 1 was damaged, so the video producers hired actors and technicians to fake a new synchronized soundtrack. The repair job is rather distracting (the suave, pencil-mustached Kenneth MacDonald suddenly has a twangy Texas tenor), but it only lasts a few minutes; the rest of the serial is fully intact and the source print is in top shape. Picture and sound are excellent. The 2-DVD set also includes a selection of trailers from Mascot, Republic, and Universal serials. Highly typical of Saturday-matinee adventures, and a fine choice for first-time serial viewers or for fans who've never seen this long-unavailable film.

7988246,1,B00008YLUE,"VCI, Please Find New Voiceover Actors. Chapter 1 is very distracting. A bad way to start the serial. Apparently, like The Phantom, some audio was damaged. So VCI hired voice actors (Movie Stuff/Houston Texas) to dub the episode. Like The Phantom, they did a horrible job. The sound effects are also horrendous. Apparently a radium energy machine sounds exactly like a circular saw. Beyond amateurish.

Worse than the horrible dub, is the lack of chapter breaks. Unlike other VCI releases, you can't skip the credits to get to the beginning of the chapter. As a matter of fact, sometimes you can't even skip to the next full chapter. Forward skip doesn't work all the time. I think it has something to do with where you started watching?You have to use the fast forward button. This is doubly annoying since this serial has previews of the next chapter you can't simply skip to avoid spoilers. You have to fast forward and hope you don't see anything you'd prefer not to....

As for the plot, it's a complete rip off of the 1937 Dick Tracy plot. Except it's a wasp here, instead of a spider. That makes all the difference. Very disappointing.

If these complaints weren't enough, the absolute worst travesty here is the complete absence of magic. This could have easily been titled John Doe Saves the Day. The Mandrake name is for advertising only. He does zero magic. Every now and then they'll have him show a cheap magic trick to a kid, or show part of his act, but he uses no magic anywhere else. Save for some smoke here and there, and even that's rare.

Columbia clearly wanted to draw in fans of the comic, without actually delivering on what was expected. This could have been any generic serial, but Mandrake it is not.",1519776000,,1727,4.633986928104576

7988254,4,B00008YLUE,"Mandrake the Magician is a 12-chapter Columbia serial released in 1939, directed by Norman Deming and Sam Nelson.  It is at present the earliest Columbia serial to be commercially issued on DVD, likely of greater interest to fans of serials than those of the newspaper feature by Lee Falk upon which it is based.

Mandrake (Warren Hull) has been off in Tibet, getting a formula for mixing a rare element, ""platinite,"" with steel to help perfect a Radium Energy Machine, being developed by his friend, Professor Houston (Forbes Murray) for the good of mankind.  We are never told just what good is supposed to come from the machine, because it has destructive powers that are of far more interest to the bad guy and producers of the serial.  The masked villian, known as ""The Wasp"" has no trouble in stealing the machine and abducting Professor Houston.  Little magic is used by Mandrake in advancing the plot, but he and his assistant Lothar (Al Kikume) do battle in traditional serial-movie style with the many henchmen of The Wasp, occasionally rescuing the Professor's daughter Betty (Doris Weston) and son Tommy (Rex Downing).  There are also associate scientists Dr. Andre Bennett, James Webster and Frank Raymond (Edward Earle, Kenneth MacDonald and Don Beddoe) one of whom may be The Wasp, who through most of the serial only appears to his henchmen via a television-like apperatus on a projection screen.

Columbia was not known for brilliant writing nor for outstanding special effects, and expectations are not exceeded here.  The plot could (and did) serve for many a serial, with little here that would suggest the title character was involved.  Mandrake gives a magic show in the first chapter, and another while disguised as a bad-guy magician, but magic doesn't get used when battling The Wasp's henchmen.  The Wasp's motives are never clear; mostly, he wants to destroy things with the Radium Machine, though occasionally these acts seem at odds with other parts of his plans.  Warren Hull made a fine hero in other serials, and where given the chance he is good enough here.  Al Kikume is a little unbelievable as his able-bodied assistant, except when stopping adversaries by bulk alone.  The rest of the characters are rather bland, though fortunately none are of the ""comic"" variety, and they read their lines adequately.  Cheapness is evident in the mockup ""equipment"" in the power plant that gets destroyed, and special effects are less than spectacular, such as the ""shaking building"" where the walls collapse while loose objects on tables stay neatly in place.  Still, the general look of the film is fairly decent.  The music, by Morris Stoloff has a lot of churnings and fanfares, but like the plot there is little substance.  The strident announcements of what would be seen next week didn't help, with the repeated ""Mandrake is attacked by agents of The Wasp!!"" being especially annoying, but I became somewhat numb to them after a few chapters, increasing my appreciation for the serial.  And there is some great nostalgia, such as Mandrake having the car filled with gasoline for $2.

Helping matters greatly in VCI's release, # 8349 on two DVD's, is the decent-quality print used, which if not flawless is clean and reasonably sharp with good contrast.  Some of the opening titles are a bit gray on the left third of the screen, and a few chapters have a lesser amount of this, but it is clearly from a fine-grain original.  In the first chapter a few spoken lines had to be dubbed-in to cover a deteriorated soundtrack; the voices used are not exact matches but are no more distracting than where the sound starts to drop out in the original.  VCI found a good balance between historic ""completeness"" and keeping it understandable.  Otherwise the sound is much better than expected for 1939 with good frequency response and low distortion.  The same ""extras"" are included on both discs: a short ""picture gallery"" mostly from the film, ""bio's"" of Warren Hull, Doris Weston, Rex Downing, Al Kikume and the two directors, and original trailers for seven serials, not including Mandrake the Magician, listed as being ""Now Available on VHS and DVD from VCI.""  I don't think they were all on DVD, but the list, from this 2003 release is:

 Zorro Rides Again (Republic, 1937)
 Dick Tracy's G-Men (Republic, 1939)
 Radar Men from the Moon (Republic, 1952)
 The Royal Mounted Rides Again (Universal, 1945)
 The Mysterious Mr. M (Universal, 1946)
 The Hurricane Express (Mascot, 1932)
 The Shadow of the Eagle (Mascot, 1932)

Mandrake the Magician is not one of the great serials, but it is interesting to see what Columbia was doing in 1939, and when watched with a day or so between chapters its faults aren't too apparent.  Unlike many serials, the story line holds up fairly well in the later chapters, the repetition kept down by the 12-chapter length.  For the price asked VCI's edition is a reasonable value, given the generally good sound and picture quality.",1306800000,10,4989,4.925837320574162
