1048539,3,630560097X,"A lovely movie with a worldclass ensemble- but Judi Dench was terribly underused and miscast as the sort of ditzy artist with her heart on her sleeve. Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith, along the same lines, should have  been given more to do, rather than relegate them to the backdrop. However,  Cher and Lily Tomlin were on target and highly engaging. This was  worthwhile feel-good-eye-candy type movie to be enjoyed with a grain of  salt.",949622400,4,440,4.826666666666667
1048540,4,630560097X,"Tea With Mussolini is Franco Zeffirelli's autobiographical remembrance of events of his boyhood in Italy before and during World War II.  It concerns the activities of a group of expatriate ladies played wittily by Cher, Judi  Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, and Lily Tomlin.  Zeffirelli performs  his usual magic in creating exquisite visual images and intriguing  characters.  Watching the actions of the characters in this movie is a  worthy reminder of how decent people can become so involved in their own  lives and interests that they allow horrendous things to happen around  them.  Fortunately, for the idealistic viewer, all of the main characters  ""come to their senses"" and are redeemed by the end of the film.  It is not particularly realistic, but it makes for a wonderful ""feel  good"" movie.  The DVD is a little disappointing in that it has no  extra features.  I yearned to have someone talk about how the real people  compared to the characters in the movie.  None-the-less, this movie is a  delicious treat.",949363200,14,1031,5.029761904761905
1048541,1,630560097X,"what can i say about this movie......it was the most pointless zeffirelli outing i have ever seen. when i was a teenager, i thought zeffirelli's romeo and juliet was bad! after seeing tea with mussolini, one can see why  movies such as life is beautiful or even schindler's list are more popular.  what i say is simple...if you want to watch this movie on a rainy weekend,  don't! SIT BACK AND ENJOY A JAMES BOND MOVIE! you can buy them right here  on amazon.com and they ARE great!",949276800,3,482,4.443181818181818
1048542,5,630560097X,"The film ""Tea with Mussolini"" deals with complex issues in such a subtle way that it is easy to dismiss if the viewer overlooks the intriquite relationships of the characters. How the characters evolve from  being self-involved  (their love of the arts and formalities) to becoming  caring individuals and creating bonds that overcome the heirarchies of the  social class structure due to race, nationality, war and a young boy that  pulls them together.  Luca a young Italian boy copes with having no family  due to being an illigitamate child in picturesque Italy during The Second  World War. Lucas mothers death and his father's refusal to take him into  his care due to a wife that would not accept him lead him to find a new  family with his father's secretary (Joan Plowright) and her sociatal peers  The Scorpioni (The Scorpions) named for the groups sharp wit and poisonous  bite. This group takes young Luca into their privliged clique and shares in  the education and introduces young Luca to The Arts which is the groups  passion. Little do they know that by doing this they have began on a road  to self change that will alter thier view on the world, thier friendships  and detestations of others in the group. This film is a story of  compassion, friendship, art, family, accepatance, change, egos, jeolousy  and shows the letting go of beliefs and the opening of hearts.  The cast is  first rate with the likes of Cher, Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, Lily  Tomlin and Judi Dench along with the perfect casting of the character Luca  played by Baird Wallace (Luca: teenager) and Charlie Lucas (Luca: child)  both of these fine young actors will grab the viewers heart and make him  want to help with the caring of and the education of this heart grabbing  character. Luca's troubles will affect the viewer and pull at one's  heartstrings. Baird Wallace is talented young actor that holds his own and  deserves praise and notice from the industry. Recomendations: Buy this  film, it is a film with grit and emotions that will make you examine your  own life and wish that you could have been as bleesed as Luca had.",948067200,81,2128,4.769230769230769
1048543,4,630560097X,"A grand ensemble of female actors, gorgeous location shooting in Florence makes for an enjoyable film. The development of the various characters almost makes one forget however, there is hardly a binding story line  driving the film forward! The story is the Scorpioni - the English ladies,  or is it the boy, the advent of war in Italy, the art - it doesn't matter,  since the scenes move gracefully and leisurely along!",945216000,5,421,4.819444444444445
1048544,5,630560097X,"Stand out performances by a great ensemble cast. Cher, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, but, my oscar nod would go to Joan Plowright. The remainder of this great cast also deserve praise but I found the only reason why the film  captivated me was because of Joan Plowright and the great portrayal of her  character. Great sets, costumes, locations, direction and cinematography.  Entertaining, interesting, and a good reflection of Europe at an important  time in history. A big thumbs up to Franco Zeffirelli. I don't care if he  imbelished or simplified his life story it made a great movie and so did  he! I would recommend this movie to all but the very small children.  Educational and Entertaining.",944956800,9,697,4.905982905982906
1048545,5,630560097X,"I learned a lot through watahing this movie. Growing up we only got the german point of veiw  and now i undetstand the Italian. Those ladies were extremely brave. I thought Judi Dench  did an excellent job as Arabella,  she made me want to love art. Joan Plowright was the teacher who made me  want to learn. Maggie Smith reminded me why I hate aristocrats. Lily Tomlin  performed as if she was the gregorious Georgie, I even wanted  to go out  excavate something. And what can you say about Cher except that its time  for another oscar.",943228800,7,537,4.463917525773196

Although I would not recommend this movie for  the very young, only because they would not be able to understand the  story. You will be entertained by a very talented director and cast.

1048641,3,630560097X,"I had high expectations for this film because of its theme and cast.  But I found it tedious, and a tremendous waste of great UK talent.  The only bright spot was Cher, who exuded energy that no one else had.",1507248000,,208,4.175
1048642,4,630560097X,"This is fun to watch once you get into the various personalities.  Basically it's about a batch of older British ladies who live in Italy and, war or not, are not, nor will they be ""ordered"" to leave their home in Italy.  This causes no small amount of frustration for the military as the ladies start a war of sorts of their own in their resolution to NOT be moved.  The Italian----or American----military doesn't know what to do about these old hens but with stubborn, if not insulted and great indignation, they root themselves to their beloved Italian home, bombs and bullets fly all around them.  It's the American actress (Cher), for whom they have such great disdain, yet who with great affection anyway, provides a means of shelter and food in an abandoned hotel where the old bitties can wait out the war.  This is all told through the eyes and memories of a boy left behind by a disinterested father and adopted by all of the ladies.  He loves the American actress, who, of course is many years older than him.  It's a young man-coming-of- age crush on a glorious woman that will always be beyond his reach but has captured his heart anyway.  It's a warm story in its way but will require close attention and patience while you get a grasp on how and why staying in a war-torn area against military order is so important to these ladies.",1505952000,,1347,4.51440329218107

1048710,5,630560097X,"This ensemble piece should become a classic.  Dame Judy Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, and (believe it or not) Cher do a fantastic job of bringing the viewer into Mussolini's Italy at the onset of WW II.  Cher portrays the only American, a Jewish American, who finds herself in Italy at a time when it was not healthy to be Jewish.  This is a story about five women who might be lost without each other during that difficult time.  I highly recommend this underrated film.

Let the characters set up at the beginning before you judge this; watch it through and you'll be glad you did!  Cher, Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, and Judi Dench were all marvelous, as well as the little boy who played Luca.  I esp. loved Joan Plowright's kind, patient and thoughtful role.

1049962,4,630560097X,"I liked this movie way more than I expected to.  I got it  because I love Judy Dench and Maggie Smith, but the movie turned out to be chockful of familiar British actors...and Cher, of course.  Its set just before WW2 and through WW2, where some English ladies in Florence have formed a group around loving the arts, while Cher plays a wealthy American woman who comes to Europe to buy art, with Lily Tomlin as her pants-wearing would-be archeologist sidekick.  The group ends up taking in a young boy named Luca whose father can't acknowledge him and whose mother has died.  The war comes along, but the ladies refuse to leave their beloved Florence, as the Maggie Smith's character thinks highly of Mussolini and even once had tea with him (hence the title) and they think it will all just blow over.  The ladies end up pulling together to help each other during the hard times of the war and being imprisoned as enemy-aliens and, also, to help save the fabulous art of Florence.

The oddball crew of English and American ladies in the movie really are the heart of the movie, with their story set against the greater backdrop of the day.  Recommended.",1427068800,,1154,4.595121951219512

when the boy gives all his money to the kids, when Elsa has to leave on the canoe at night, when she lays in her room crying believing in him, and when her rival discovers Elsa has been helping with $ and recognizes they need to be allies.

They are called the Scorpione and the leader, played by Maggie Smith, is the consummate snob who levies cruel comments on those who are deemed less than she. This vicious, lonely woman claims to know Il Duce himself because her husband was a lower echelon embassy official who took her to meet Il Duce once. She keeps telling her group that Il Duce will invite her to tea soon.  When her character insults an American Jewess, played by Cher, she doesn't know that this woman will save her life one day.  The cast is Cher, Lily Tomlin, Judi Dench, and Joan Plowright.  Franco Zeffirelli directed. The dialogue sparkles with wit and intelligence.  The story is told through the voice and experience of a little boy who grows into manhood during WWll in Italy. Great movie.",1403654400,,884,4.758169934640523

1050450,5,630560097X,"I saw Teas With Mussolini many years ago when it came out.  I was not surprised when Cher won an Oscar for her performance.  I was surprised that Maggie Smith did not.  This is the story of a group of ex-patriot British women living in pre-WW II Italy, and what happens to them and to the American women (Cher and Lily Tomlin) when the war breaks out.  The only Jewish character in the story, Cher's character, commits an act of tremendous unselfishness when the British women are declared enemy aliens, and against Mussolini's clear pronouncement to Maggie Smith's character, not only does not protect them, but takes them into custody.  This is a story of incredible kindness and acts of small-mindedness also.  But it is also a story of how people can redeem themselves when they find out the truth of their own situation.  I was thrilled to watch this classic again after so many years.  It was as great a story now as it was then.  I especially appreciated, at the end, knowing what happened to each of the characters in the movie.  I highly recommend this movie for its human interest and because of its basis in fact.",1401926400,,1124,4.575

1050595,3,630560097X,"Here is a film with an outstanding cast of actors, photographed in Florence Italy and the surrounding Tuscan area, and directed by a man with an eye for beauty. It should be a success but unfortunately it just does not hold together.  After seeing the film I tried to put my finger on why it does not succeed. I think the problem is that the script is weak and overly sentimental and there are just too many actors which means in essence that everyone plays a cameo. When everyone plays a cameo role in a play full of stereotypes, there is no glue to hold the pieces together.  In this case, Zeffirelli tried to use the story of the illegitimate boy, Luca, mothered by all the women in the film, as the feature that keeps everyone together, but it just barely works and does not really work well.  I loved the photography of Florence in the first 30 minutes of the film, it is obvious that Zeffirelli loves the city, as did generations of English citizens who made this city home away from Great Britain. Cutting the characters played by Lily Tomlin and Judi Dench and removing the obvious predictable aspects of the script would have strengthened this film.",1389225600,2,1158,4.5311004784688995

It delves into interesting, timeless issues like the value of art, the meaning of commitments, the human spirit and strength in the face adversity. It could have been a good piece of work if it were not for the wooden and totally unconvincing portrayal of Elsa Morganthal by Cher. The other excellent character actresses in the movie presented clear, if somewhat caricatured portrayals, but Cher behaves like a lost high school girl and ends up reciting lines without any emotional committment to them. Several of her scenes with Luca which should have been relevations turn absurd when Cher recites lines from a good script as if she were reading the phone book.

Cher is brilliant as the BIGGER than life BOroadway show girl who prances her wild life in frontof the conservative British women, but WWII has a way of untiing them in an incredible fashion in a touching story of high class survival due someone's love and sacrifice (watch and see).

1050781,4,630560097X,"""Tea With Mussolini"" depicts what turns out to be the end of a little known aspect of Florentine history, that of its (mostly) English expat community.  Unlike it's Parisian counterpart, which produced some of the most important writers and artists of the Twentieth Century, the Florentine colony was more focused on sex, parties, and back-biting gossip and this comes across fairly well in the movie, where the ladies portray dangerously naive socialites drifting through lives of splendid idleness, utterly blind to the idea that Western Civilization is about to go over a cliff.  To them, Mussolini is a welcome breath of order, and for a while, their protector, not the thug that he and his fascist goons actually were.  Needless to say, this aspect of the film doesn't end well.  We mock these women at our peril though, as our own government's policies in the Middle East are having consequences that are pushing us towards war, and most Americans are no more informed than these women.  it could be said that we are having tea with our own Mussolini...

With Maggie Smith and Judi Dench  in the cast, comparisons to Merchant-Ivory's ""A Room With A View"" and ""Downton Abbey"" are inevitable.  Of the three, I think this film is the least convincing in setting it's period.  To me, much of the film seems to be a period costume performance in Florence, than a depiction of 1940's Florence.  That said, it's a Zefferelli film, and it is pretty to look at.  The costumes are gorgeous, and it shows some good shots of Florence streets and piazzas.

While I purchased this film, it was more as a ""souvenir"" of Florence---had it taken place elsewhere, I probably would not have made such a commitment.  I recommend this as a rental.  The problem is, you can't.  Not on Amazon or Netflix-Streaming.  It's not available.  I had to go to VuDu to watch it.  Sadly, our rapid acceptance of new technology has sunk much of the video rental business before the Studios and Streamers have worked out the copyright details and thus, all too often, gaps appear, with few brick and mortar options available to fill the void.  If you can find it, I think you'll enjoy it.",1362096000,6,2158,4.737265415549598

Going through the plot and yammering on about who does what is a waste of time here. You want to know the plot? Watch the movie. You want to know who acted well? Watch the movie. I think everyone who has a woman over fifty in their neighborhood, or in their life, should watch this movie. The acting is supreme. The setting is stunning. The writing perfect. The director and producers and everyone behind the camera help produce this timeless wonder. How did it slip quietly between the cracks toward oblivion? Ladies, call your friends.

The film is supposed to be semi-autobiographical on the director, Franco Zeffirelli, and his childhood, which takes place in Italy just before the start of WWII. All of the women are expatriates and choose to stay in Italy as war breaks out. And even though they get a promise from Mussolini that the war will not bother them or their lifestyle, the women find themselves rounded up and imprisoned in a dilapidated building.

Whether or not the film is factual is irrelevant because the movie is really about friendships and extended family. TEA WITH MUSSOLINI  was made in 1999 and the transfer to DVD is good providing a clear picture and features both widescreen and standard on a double-sided DVD.

OK, the film has got some great shots of Tuscany and that is worth something, but who the hell wrote the screenplay for this movie? I mean, I like a lot of chick flicks but this . . . .

Where to begin? The---disjointed---plot revolves around a group of dotty old English ladies who have made Florence their home. In the ten years or so that they have lived there, not one has learned a single word of Italian. Then they get interned during the war and for some, unstated, reason a young man dresses up as a woman instead of being interned with the men. Then you have Luca an Italian boy/young man who has a thick British accent who in the middle of the war returns after a few months wearing a British uniform and is apparently part of a British unit. Then you have a vulgar American Jewess (as described by one of the other women), played by Cher, who is later interned but who escapes by going . . . . ?

It's the story of several English women, referred to as the Scorpioni who live in Florence, Italy. They are all in love with Italy and happily take advantage of the great art and beauty of Florence. It's home to them!

The ladies have a small close community and a few of them become involved with Luca, who is the illegitimate son of a local man.  After his mother dies, he's placed in an orphanage. The ladies are Mary (Joan Plowright), Arabella (Judi Dench) and Hester ( Maggie Smith), and all help to care for the boy in some way. Because Hester is the widow of an English statesman, she  tries to dominate the other ladies, but they can usually ignore her snobbish ways. The English ladies are also assisted by two American friends. Elsa (Cher), plays the part of a wealthy art lover from America and quietly fiances Luca's education. Georgie (Lily Tomlin), a visiting archaeologist is also involved in helping Luca.

When World War II breaks out the women are more than overwhelmed with the events. In their naivet&eacute;, they are hopeful that  Mussolini himself will grant them some type of protection.

1051115,4,630560097X,"It's a wonderful happenstance that the British attitude
toward Italian Fascism coincides so wonderfully with the
apparent blindness of the English ladies who are out to
have tea with Mussolini.
It is true that Mussolini's alliance with Hitler was by
no means a foregone conclusion and that Italian Fascism
was very different from the German variety. It was particularly
much less racist, being colored by the multiethnic background
of the Italians themselves.
So politically, Britain was not initially fearful of Mussolini.
There was also a prevailing attitude of condescension toward
Italy and its people before the war. Many Britains thought
that 'having the trains run on time' was just what the
benighted Italians needed.

So the diplomatic shock is mirrored in the small world of ladies
living on their trusts in Florence. They deny, they cope,
and ultimately they respond with  noblesse oblige and courage.

There are some fine performances here. Judy Dench is such a
good actress that she's past acting. The show however, is
stolen by Cher who belies her pop-star/campy image with
another smart and sensitive interpretation of a character.
Some critics have objected that she was merely playing herself,
but what a self to play!

The story is just a bit sappy and also a bit calculated, but
this is a beautiful movie-a feast for the eyes and a reminder
of the dangers of taking things at face value.

It has a nice balance of atmosphere, characterization and action.  The photography and scenery alone are worth the price of admission.  Missing is the magnificent music that Zeffirelli usually has in his films.  Contrary to the amazon reviewer, the film is quite focused and carries with it a tension, although the tension is deliberately kept from becoming oppressive.  The path of the story is not at all ""predictable"" with several surprising turns.  There are a few laughs in the beginning, but this is a serious film.

I went back to Zeffirelli's Autobiography to re-read the passages dealing with the scorpioni.  They were real, of course, but apparently this story is fictional, as are all the characters except Mary Wallace.  Zeffirelli put some incidents from his own life into the movie, and the actor who played Luca bears a striking resemblance to the young Zeffirelli, but that is all.  Zeffirelli was illegitimate.  He lived with his mother the first few years until she died.  He was then brought up by a cousin.  He was accosted by his father's wife, and his father did put him to study English with one of the old English ladies of Florence, Mary O'Neill, who was fond of playing the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet with him.  But when the scorpioni were rounded up and shipped out of Florence, Zeffirelli says (p. 24) that he never saw Mary O'Neill again.  He hid out in the mountains to avoid the draft and headed south, finally meeting up with the Allied front lines.  The encounter with them in the movie is more or less like the book.

He has shown this in his ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Taming of the Shrew,"" ""Hamlet,"" and ""Jesus of Nazareth."" Generally speaking, I DO NOT like war movies. Mainly because one, they tend to glorify people getting killed. Also, because character development normally takes a back seat to people getting blown up. Well, this movie qualifies as an exception. The story starts in Italy few years before World War II. The young Luca gradually realizes that his mother has died. To be sure, his father helps a little, but very little. Well Luca falls under the care of Maggie Smith (English), Joan Plowright (English), Judi Dench (English), Cher (Jewish), and Lily Tomlin (American). What these women share in common is that Italy will of course declare war on their different countries. Mussolini promises Maggie Smith (who may be able to provide some diplomatic favors) that she and her friends will be safe. Of course we don't need to think too hard to understand that this promise will only be carried through if it serves Mussolini in some way. (Despite the title, Mussolini only has a brief part.) Well, later, Luca's father decides that German ""...is the language of tomorrow."" So, Luca has to leave these women who were so kind to him. And of course, Italy joins Germany in the war. These women become prisoners, though not all at once. (Cher and Lily Tomlin have a bit more time of freedom.) Well, Luca (now grown up) returns, and offers what comfort he can to these women. He also has an on and off relationship with the energetic Cher. While Cher has her faults, she is heroic. She shows care for the Jews who will be in danger if they don't get out of Italy. She also uses her own money to move Smith, Plowright, and Dench to a hotel. (It is still a prison, but it is more of a country club type prison.) Another plot comes into play when a playboy is after Cher's money. Maggie Smith does not care for Cher, but will she rise to the occasion and save Cher? What makes this so different (as far as war movies are concerned) is that the war is in the background. The real story is the suffering of these women. So, we have the horrors of war without the glory. (But we can trust that Hollywood probably won't ever figure this out.) Interestingly, Luca never loses his love of art, and in a moment of desperation, Dench throws herself in front of art to stop the Nazis from blowing it up. Even if you don't like war movies, this is one you should make an exception for.

1051152,4,630560097X,"When it was first released, my wife and I saw Tea with Mussolini at a small theater in our neighborhood, the Drexel East theater in Bexley. The cast was simply wonderful, bringing a multidimensional story to life, complete with a whole set of characters of depth and realism.

The movie's official tagline is, ""a story of civilized disobedience,"" but I found myself focusing on rather a different part of the story, that of a young boy who became a man. The young boy, Luca, was the illegitimate son of an Italian businessman. With his mother dead and his father absent, Luca is raised by an Englishwoman, Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright), who is part of a group of English living it Italy just before World War II. Mary enlists help from her friends to ensure that the boy is taken care of. A wealthy American who sometimes lived among the English ""Scorpioni,"" Elsa Morganthal Strauss-Armistan (Cher), was a friend of Luca's mother and set up a trust for him.

Mary not only ensured that Luca was going to school and pursuing his studies, but she spent time with him, spoke with him, and instilled in him the values that would make him a proper English gentleman--apparently the only desire that his father had for him.

As Italy became increasingly aligned with Nazi Germany, the charming and peaceful existence in Florence gave way to incarceration for the Scorpioni, and a great deal of mystery surrounding Elsa. Luca was sent to an Austrian boarding school, as his father determined that Italy's future was not with England, but with Germany. After his studies, he returned to Italy, and soon found himself jealous of Elsa's Italian lover, deeply infatuated with her, and in her employ: secretly delivering documents that would allow their Jewish recipients to flee the country.

I was especially taken with the character of Mary; not only was she able to perceive what was right and wrong but she acted on it and worked good among those within her sphere of influence. Her strength, moral courage, and gentleness made quite a difference for young Luca. And he was wise enough usually to pay attention. Even after he had gone off to school and returned fully grown, Mary did not hold back from correcting him when he behaved badly. She became cross with him when his youthful jealousy blinded him; even so, in her reprimand, she offered him what he needed not just to understand that he was wrong but what he must do to correct his course. ""What are your hurt feelings when there are lives at stake?""

Rather than stupidly insisting on pursuing his misstep, Luca wisely took the lesson; he not only quit complaining about being Elsa's ""messenger boy"" but also used the money that Elsa had years earlier put into a trust for him to help the resistance and to get Elsa to safety when her life was in danger. When the resistance asked where he got the money, he told Wilfred Random, Lady Hester's grandson, that the money was intended to help him grow up, but that it didn't help very much because he forgot the first rule of a gentleman: love thyself last.  (This is a reference to Shakespeare's Henry VIII, which reminded us of a wonderful scene earlier, when Mary used Shakespeare to entertain and to teach the young boy under her guidance.)

In his corrected action, Luca set aside whatever inconvenience and heartache he had, moving beyond them, taking action intended for more than just ""to feel good"" or ""to have fun,"" but to adhere to a principle that was important to him, one that was instilled, we presume, by Mary Wallace. It had an impact was both concrete and specific: it saved the life of a woman whose generosity with her fortune allowed him to be educated and raised in relative comfort. He acted well in the moment, and (as Johann Kaspar said) performed a good action to all eternity. Would that others thus behaved; what atrocities might have been avoided.

Cher has had 3 or 4 great acting performances in movies, Moonstruck, The Mask, Silkwood and this Tea with Mussolini. She does NOT play Cher, she plays a character, and plays it convincingly.

All of these women had things to do other than attend to that waif, but they attended to him anyway.  And they didn't just love and adore him -- they spent arduous energy helping develop his mind, his talents, morals, ethics.  And when he grew older and they faced serious trouble, turnabout's fair play, and he was there for them.  That's the story.

1051188,4,630560097X,"Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, who also wrote the screenplay with John Mortimer, this (1999) semi-autobiographical tale revolves around an illegitimate Italian child named Luca, whose wealthy father provides financial support but otherwise ignores him.  Taken under the wing of Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright), one of a group of British women who have remained in Italy during the rule of Mussolini, he learns English and enjoys the only stability he has ever known.  When Italy allies itself with Germany, his father sends him off to school in Germany, but Luca remains close to ""Miss Mary.""

Lady Hester Random (Maggie Smith), artist Arabella (Judi Dench), and several other expatriots, are all in Mary Wallace's very British social circle.  Under Lady Hester's direction, they are insulated, self-satisfied, and exclusive, and regard people like Elsa Morganthau-Strauss, an American parvenu and art-collector (Cher), as beneath them. She mockingly refers to them as the ""scorpioni,"" an opinion shared by Georgie, an American  archaeologist (Lily Tomlin).  When the fascists threaten their lifestyle, Lady Hester, widow of the former ambassador, has tea with Mussolini, who promises to look after her and her friends personally.  When war breaks out, however, promises are broken, and it is up to Luca, back from Germany, to try to help.

The level of irony is suggested in the title, as the ""scorpioni"" refuse to believe that Mussolini's ""ungentlemanly"" behavior could possibly affect them.  Zeffirelli, alternates semi-serious scenes with extravagant, absurd scenes, much like the comic relief of the Shakespearean plays he has also directed, and he casts the film so that each of his stars plays to type--Maggie Smith as the hopelessly snobby aristocrat, Judi Dench as a fey and flighty artiste, Joan Plowright as the sweet and thoughtful grandmotherly sort, Cher as the most extravagant and crass American ever filmed, and Lily Tomlin as the no-nonsense realist who enjoys sticking pins into those who puff themselves up.  The roles do not call for subtlety or originality, but it is great fun to watch these screen legends having fun here.

The gorgeous scenery, art, and architecture of Tuscany are well filmed by David Watkin, and the tone of the film remains light, focusing on the women and Luca almost exclusively. A satiric tale poking fun at everything from American crassness and British class-consciousness to the absurdities of Mussolini's pretentions, the film virtually ignores fascism's serious realities for the sake of the story line and its humor.

1051190,4,630560097X,"Set in Florence and covering roughly 10 years from the brink of World War II to the liberation of ""Il Scorpioni"", Zeffirelli's film boasts a great cast: from the group of English women who love all things Italian-- Maggie Smith as Lady Hester, Judi Dench as Arabella, Joan Plowright as Mary to Lily Tomlin as Georgie, Cher as Elsa, and last but certainly not least, Baird Wallace as the older Luca based loosely on the director, himself. The group of English women will not leave Florece even in the face of an impeding war; Lady Hester, in her naivete assumes that tea with Mussolini will guarantee her and her friends' safety.
The film is a little predictable and somewhat rosy. On the other hand, If Luca is based on Zeffirelli, he obviously lived to tell his tale so perhaps this rosiness is justified. Cher seems to play Cher and isn't terribly convincing as a rich Jewish American; and her wardrobe is gaudy enough to belong to her. On the other hand, the three British actresses are great, particularly Maggie Smith who cannot abide Americans. My favorite line of hers is that Americans [referring to Elsa] can even ""vulgarize"" ice cream.
Of course it's impossible to make an ugly movie that's filmed in Florence; this one is no exception. (It's probably impossible for this director to make a less than beautiful movie.)

It has impeccable production values and the footage of tuscany alone is worth the price of ticket, but there is much more going on.
Zeffirelli's charcter is Luca - first played by Charlie Lucas in youth; and Baird Wallace when older. I liked the subtle reference to Romeo and Juliet that he was later to direct.
He is abandoned by his useless father who pays for an education and wants to forget about him. He is raised in Florence by Mary (Joan Plowright), the middle-aged secretary of his father but is basically shared among a band of British and American women, who adore Italian art.
A cast features Maggie Smith as the impossible British lady, an art enthusiast played by Judi Dench, a lesbian archaeologist played by Lily Tomlin, and an astonishing rich and flambouyant Elsa, played by Cher, in her best role to date.
Set against the rise of fascism, the incredible inhumanity of man, is balanced by a small group of women look after each other. Tea with Mussolini is a fine film that seems to float over the dark chasms it covers.

1051194,3,630560097X,"""Tea with Mussolini"" portrays the beautiful Italian landscape and the superb acting of the incredible Maggie Smith, Judy Dench, Joan Plowright, Lilly Tomlin and the lovely Cher; however, in spite of these virtues the movie can be quite slow and even tedious at times and does not have the magic of other ""Italian"" films that come to mind such as ""Enchanted April"" and ""A room with a view"".
This is a story of a few lives intertwined by circumstance and World War II. Luca, an illegitimate child, unwanted by his father, is raised by the loving and patient Mary Wallace who is helped by a group of English ladies. Luca's father has a notion of making him ""an English Gentlemen"", a notion that soon changes according to the new political winds to become a wish of making him a ""German businessman"".... We meet the ""Scorpions"", a group of British ladies living in pre world war II Florence, headed by Maggie Smith who plays the widow of the British Ambassador - as she never fails to remind everyone. Scorpions is a nickname invented by Elsa, a rich American performer (Cher) who both laughs at and likes the group. Elsa becomes the benefactor of Luca and opens a trust for him, a favor he will return in the years to come.
I confess that the mixture of Italian charm with British ladies usually works for me and any film bringing us this excellent group of actors cannot be bad. However, ""Tea with Mussolini"" is not always credible and the characters are somewhat exaggerated.  The war remains in the background, as something nor the ladies nor the viewers are able to fully grasp. The ladies would not leave Italy due to their love of the place and their nave belief in Mussolini and an effort is made to show how their lives are affected. We are supposed to understand the dreadfulness of war from the cruel separation of one British lady from her dog, or from the fact that they are supposed to sleep in a dirty crowded place. On the other hand, an effort is made to show the viewers that the ladies ""cannot be given orders"". I do wish that would have been true at times of wars.  Not very convincing. However, if not taken as a true picture of reality the movie can be quite enjoyable.",1055721600,6,2187,4.52020202020202

A friend of his late mother, wealthy American Cher, becomes a benefactress.

With a cast like this one (Cher, Dench, Plowright, Smith, and Lily Tomlin), of course the acting is very good.  Director Franco Zeffirelli does a terrific job establishing the atmosphere and mood of the time, with beautiful shots of Florence, the Italian countryside, and great works of art.

1051218,4,630560097X,"Tea With Mussolini is director Franco Zefferilli's partly autobiographical account of the experiences of a boy named Luca in Fascist Italy. The story begins just before German declares war on Poland in 1939 and ends with the liberation of Italy by the Allied Forces in 1944. During the Second World War, Italy's dictator, Mussolini, was allied with Hitler's Nazi Germany. England and France declared war on both counties in 1939, and by late 1941, America had done the same. Prior to the war, there were numerous British and American expatriates who lived permanently abroad. Many of these lived in small colonies in Italy. Not political by nature, many of these people paid scant attention to the growing threat of war. As a result, they went from privileged people with very pleasant lives to prisoners of war.
It is in this unstable and dangerous situation that we find young Luca. He is the illegitimate son of an Italian clothing merchant and a dress maker. When his mother dies, Luca put is in a school. His father is too concerned about his marriage and his social position to have much concern. His nominal guardian is the middle-aged Mary [Joan Plowright], an English employee of his father's. As Luca's situation continues to deteriorate, Mary finds herself more or less stuck with the child. She loves him, but she's a spinster and feels unable to cope with the task. She turns to some of her female British friends, and they all set out to raise him. When the war breaks out, this becomes an almost insurmountable problem when the ladies lose all rights and freedoms.
There are those who have found the plot to be both improbably and somewhat maudlin. I don't disagree entirely, but I find that Tea With Mussolini's assets far outweigh these issues. Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Lili Tomlin are all successful, talented and seasoned actresses. Between them, they have four Oscar wins, seven nominations, and 187 film roles. To see these women together in the same movie is, to me, well worth the price of admission. They are as good at comedy as they are at drama, and they bring to the film a sense of humor that offsets what might have been a rather dark tale. All can take the most mundane line and give it life. Each can say volumes with a simple glance. Cher is especially good as an American heiress, although this is a painful reminder that she hasn't done much with her film career since Moonstruck in 1987. The other ladies have been continuously active.
The film's other marvel is David Watkin's extraordinary photography. We often go to a movie and note the visual impact of two or three scenes - Jim Carey's saying good morning to the camera in The Truman Show, young Forrest Gump's leg braces falling away as he runs from the bullies, the Normandy Invasion in Saving Private Ryan, etc. But Watkins gives us scores of memorable shots. He makes Tea With Mussolini almost too beautiful, if that is possible. He has more than a creative talent with cameras. He has utter confidence and authority. I would gladly see the movie again simply for these visual delights. Expect to see his name at the Oscars. He's won before.
This film excels as an aesthetic achievement. It has neither sex nor violence nor, to a degree, a spellbinding plot. What it has is elegance, something which was once fairly common in movies, but which is now a sort of an endangered species.",1016668800,7,3405,4.734006734006734
1051219,4,630560097X,"Based loosely on the autobiography of the director, Franco Zeffinelli, this film is a light frothy comedy about a serious subject.  It is the story of Italy in the 1930s and Mussolini's rise to power.  It is also the story of the young illegitimate son of a textile merchant who gets adopted by a group of eccentric aging Englishwomen living in Florence.  The delightful cast includes English Maggie Smith as a dowager grande dame who looks down her nose with disdain at everything around her, Judy Dentch as an dotty art lover, Joan Plowright as a sensible motherly type and Lily Tomlin as an a forthright lesbian.  Surrounded by the art and grandeur of Florence, these ladies love Italy and refuse to believe that their lives will change under the darkening clouds of fascism. Into this mix comes Cher as the rich American ex-chorus girl who marries rich men wears beautiful outfits.

1051222,5,630560097X,"I've always enjoyed Franco Zeffirelli's films and opera productions and this film is no exception.  This semi-autobiographical coming of age story fits so well among the usual coming of age stories of people in the arts.  So many of these people have grown up with a close mothering or woman-based support system.  That the child-teen here is not legitimate and has a whole clan of English and American women to raise him in Fascist-filled 1930s' and 1940s' Italy, makes him virtually predestined for a career in the arts. These women are even willing to risk their lives to preserve Italian frescoes, which only an artist would bother to recount.

The ensemble cast of women is superb.  Maggie Smith has the English elitist down perfectly by this point in her career and she can be quietly hilarious playing it, especially in her misguided belief that ""Il Duce"" is protecting her in Italy. Cher returns to the screen in a wonderfully luminous role as a wealthy American entertainer, who is also Jewish and about to be sold to out to the Germans by her Italian boyfriend.  John Mortimer co-scripted the film with Zeffirelli. Mortimer created the fictional ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" so he is well able to flesh out all of these eccentric English characters. It is also quite common for artists to return to childhood-adolesence when evaluating where their germination in the arts began.  Both Fellini and Bergmann returned to their childhoods too in semi-autobiographical form in several of their films.

1051224,5,630560097X,"Grand, eloquent, exotic, touching!  Good descriptives for the Franco Zeffirelli film ""Tea with Mussolini""!
 Considered autobiographical of Zeffirelli himself, this film soars--and one can readily see Franco's  cinematic touches--not only with the all-star cast (a trite expression but  nonetheless apt) but with the storyline itself.
 Set just shortly  before World War II in Florence, the movie showcases a group of proper  British ladies (where else would they be but in Italy?) who  seem
perfectly at peace here.  They have undertaken the care of a young  outcast boy and set about to teach him proper British ways.  They interact  as if there were no cares.  After all, they have the personal world of Il  Duce that no harm will come to them should the war descend.  And descend it  does and only the naive (Maggie Smith) could believe in the integrity of  Mussolini!  These expatriate Brits choose to stay in Italy and, of course,  the worst case scenario transpires.  They are caught in the crossfires of  the war machine.  The other ladies in the film include Cher, Joan  Plowright, Judi Dench, and Lily Tomlin.
 Cher scores one of her best  roles as the lone American in the film, a friend of the British ladies, and  as the war continues, even her money and influence are  no longer enough to  save her.  Her Jewish background does not settle well with the Fascists  there, who are more than eager to please Herr Hitler and his war  machine.
 Zeffirelli fills his film with typical cinematic  beauty--whether it be in the actors, the acting, the scenery, the score,  it's all superb.  His ability to fuse the drama with appropriate amounts of  comic relieve also add to the film, and his reputation.  Hats off to the  entire movie company!

A story about love,  friendships, girl-power, togetherness through the thick & thin during  the worst of time, triumph of the human spirit.  Highly recommended.",959990400,,648,5.144230769230769
1051258,5,630560097X,"I meant to write something earlier on this film because I really like it. My husband and I saw it on the big screen and then bought the DVD. Although it is a ""chick flick"" Cher's presence  kept my husband  interested. At one point in the story, Cher is asked. ""Are all women  in America like you?"" (The setting of the film is Italy.) She turns to  the camera and says, ""Alas, NO.""  The audience cracked up at this  remark because she is unique even to Americans. I love Cher, and I adore  Maggie Smith and Judy Denton. I last saw Maggie and Judy together in  ""Room With A View"" another film shot in Italy.
The story line  is simple. A group of female English citizens, long-time residents of  Italy, stay on after Mussolini takes control although there are indications  they may be imperiling their lives. The women choose to see him as a  benevolent dictator, simply restoring order to a disorganized people. As  his takeover unfolds, the lives of these English ex-pats becomes more and  more difficult. Those who have been working lose their jobs. All of them  lose the right to move freely, shop, travel etc. These restrictions  noticably mirror the treatment of the Jews.  Finally, the group decides to  meet with Mussolini and talk about their problems. Maggie Smith, widow of  the former English ambassador, plans a tea with Mussolini. At the tea, the  women fail to understand Mussolini is merely patronizing them, and stalling  for time. Their lives continue to deteriorate, especially after England  declares war on the Axis. Eventually, the women are rounded up and herded  into what must be the most beautiful detention center ever--an old  fortress-castle on a remote hill in northern Italy. They stay there until  the liberation at the end of the war.
The humor in this film is  reminiscent of ""Life is Beautiful.""  One learns to laugh at the  enemy to survive.  I will never forget an interview Art Linkletter held  with a Jewish survivor of the concentration camps who had written a book on  humor. (Linkletter was the Donahue of the 1960's). When Art asked the man  how he survived the camps, he said ""I always focused on how stupid  those soldiers looked prancing around in their shiny uniforms while we  stood before them looking like a clutch of plucked chickens.""
The  plot of ""Tea"" is similar to ""Life"" except instead of a  concentration camp, the prisoners are held in an old fortress, and instead  of a group of men hiding a child, a group of women are hiding a Jewess.  There are many humorous scenes as the women prisoners outfox the stupid  Italian facist soldiers guarding them. Their ultimate coup is to protect  and hide Cher who is not only an American, but Jewish.
This is a great  DVD, buy it.",958867200,,2725,4.676532769556025
1051259,5,630560097X,"Sometimes an idea comes along for a movie and you think, ooh, that's a good idea! Even from the title you sometimes get a notion about the film itself. I'm not sure how true that is of ""Tea with Mussolini,"" for other  viewers, but I found myself drawn to this movie the first time someone  said, ""Have you seen..."" I thought: there's a good idea. And I finally got  around to seeing it.
Well, it's a wonderful movie, for all sorts of  reasons. I love films set in a certain period - not too far away, mind you  (unless we're talking ""Braveheart"" or King Arthur), but fifty or so years  ago, at least. Among other recent films, I'm thinking of ""The English  Patient"" and ""A Room with a View"" I suppose, as I write that. They are both  great period pieces and happily, fine cinema as well. This was no  exception. Once again, English social habits were put under a spotlight,  and this time one of the main sub-plots turned upon the difference in  attitude of the staid old English and those brash young things, only a few  centuries old, the Americans. What a discovery this particular American was  for me. Cher played the part of the rather loud New York jewess to  perfection. When it came to the dnouement, she was equally good at playing  a more refined, withdrawn role, of a woman about to escape from mortal  danger. For though the film has its light side, we are nevertheless in a  war zone, accompanying a group of female detainees who decided not to quit  Il Duce's domain until it was too late.
It's a film that not only shows  us people failing to get on together in easy circumstances; it also shows  us that they can learn to cooperate across the silliest of imagined  boundaries once things start hotting up. So for expressing that hopefulness  (as well as being good cinema), it's worth all five stars.",957830400,3,1817,4.475609756097561

This movie was a great crowd pleaser, though overlooked by the  academy this year. The scorpioni were perhaps too cute, and facism was  maybe too much a cartoon to tell the story with complete authority.
