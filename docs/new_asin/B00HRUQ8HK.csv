6200847,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"I loved this movie, but then I'm a mystery buff. Before this movie I never viewed garage sales as possible scenes for a mystery. But it sure worked for this film. And I loved Jennifer's (Lori Laughlin) curiosity and how her mind worked. Not even the police made the connection between the yard sales and three robberies until she brought it to one detective's attention. I also loved how supportive and fun her family and business partner were as she helped solved the case and her friend's murder.

I gave this 4 stars because there one downside. It was a wee bit predictable, as far as the murder was concerned. Otherwise I would have given it a full five stars for its humor, the acting, romance and mystery. I highly recommend it for those who love mysteries and Hallmark movies.",1403913600,9,783,4.5928571428571425
6200848,5,B00HRUQ8HK,This story is written well and kept my interest.  Lori Loughlin has been in other movies that I purchased so I decided to try this one and happy that I did.,1403222400,,156,4.032258064516129
6200849,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"This one had more depth than the average Hallmark movie, which was a pleasant surprise.  However, I usually buy these Hallmark DVD's to watch with my 12 year old daughter because I DO pretty much know what to expect and this was a bit much for her, with the whole murder-mystery saga being just a little too intense for her.",1402358400,,324,4.4
6200850,5,B00HRUQ8HK,"Garage Sale Mystery is about a woman named Jennifer Shannon (Lori Loughlin) who loves going to garage sales on Saturday mornings. Jennifer works at a second hand store with her friend, Danielle (Sarah Strange).  Every Saturday after Jennifer buys something at a garage sale she brings it back to the shop to sell it again.  One Saturday morning when Jennifer was about to leave the house to go to another garage sale, she notices that there are a lot of break-ins in nice areas where there had been a garage sale recently. One Saturday afternoon Jennifer drives to a garage sale that just so happens to be her friend, Kate's (Anne Marie DeLuise)  house.  A couple of days later Jennifer calls Kate and she does not answer. Jennifer goes into the house and sees Kate laying on the floor dead. Jennifer calls 911 and talks to a man named Adam Iverson (Andrew Dunbar).  Jennifer and Adam both work together to find out who killed Kate. Jennifer and Adam first think the people who killed Kate were these three burglars who broke in the other houses who had garage sales,  Celeste (Britt Irvin) Ralph (Matty Finochio) and Fred (Sebastian Gacki).  Watch this movie to see who killed Kate.  IT WILL SURPRISE YOU. I am not a fan of murder movies but I loved Lori Loughlin as Aunt Becky in Full House.  If you remember  Lori Loughlin as Aunt Becky watch this movie. She is great in this. Enjoy!",1401840000,9,1386,4.574898785425101

6200852,1,B00HRUQ8HK,"This is not a real detective movie , it's a joke film from a joke network . It's producers wouldn't know a real mystery if they saw one , just a mindless movie for an audience that doesn't care about the detective genre .",1400976000,3,221,4.045454545454546
6200853,5,B00HRUQ8HK,"I loved this movie! It was a great way to look at a mystery through a brand new perspective. The acting was good and the mystery stays just that until the very end. While I thought I knew who did it, it was not until the end that everything became clear. This was a well written movie and I for one would love to be able to see Lori Loughlin in more of these movies, or even as a series. This movie was a lot of fun and the idea of the mysteries was novel and different. A great movie that your whole family will enjoy!

6200942,4,B00HRUQ8HK,IT WAS INTERESTING AND INTRIGUING. IT WAS SUSPENSFUL.,1485043200,,53,5.75
6200943,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"I want to start by saying, in researching the books this movie series is based on, they appear to be more along the line of thrillers, and not cozies. Hallmark adapted them into the cozy style. (For a series similar in subject, written in true cozy form, I suggest the Garage Sale Mysteries by Sarah Harris. They are really wonderful books.)

Since Ive never read the books this series is based on, I cant do a comparison between them. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie.

About the movie:
In GARAGE SALE MYSTERY protagonist, Jennifer Shannon (played by Lori Loughlin) is a married mom of two children. She co-owns a resale shop with her friend, Danielle (Sarah Strange). Jennifer hits all the garage sale in town looking for treasure to resale in her shop, as well as on eBay. Jennifer soon makes a connection to local robberies and garage sales, and begins to believe the accidental death of a friend was no accident, but instead murder connected to the robberies, and she plans to prove it.

My thoughts:
I loved going on the garage sale trips with Jennifer. It was fun to see the way she scanned the merchandise and zoomed in on the best pieces. I really enjoyed when I recognized a piece like she did, and I knew the value of the item. Watching made me want to start going to yard sales (except that whole getting up way early on a Saturday morning thing does no appeal to me). I loved Jennifers resale shop. She had a lot of amazing pieces in there. The scenes in the shop with co-owner Danielle (Dani) were some of my favorites. Dani was unique and quirky, and balanced nicely off Jennifers more down to earth personality. I also really liked Jennifers husband and children.

As far as the mystery went, I found it to be very creative, and frighteningly enough, something that could happen in real life. Thieves scoping out garage sales in rather wealthy neighborhoods to get an idea of the wealth of the sellers really does seem plausible. What seemed less realistic to me was the owners allowing people to roam through their homes to look at items they didn't want to bring outside. These were garage sales, not estate sales. Maybe it happens more than I know, but I would never allow strangers to roam around my house, or let them in to use my bathroom! And Im not even wealthy!

Jennifer took to investigating very quickly. Although, like a lot leads in a mystery, Jennifer tends to get a little too lost in her investigations. Im sure she doesnt think shes being obvious in her questioning of people, but sitting there watching the movie, I just wanted to grab her arm and pull her back! A refreshing part of the story was when she went to the police with her suspicions about how the thieves were casing homes, and one detective was willing to hear her out and actually believed her. He did find it a bit of a stretch that her friends death had anything to do with the robberies. But they worked together nicely. Of course, there is a murder, so Jennifer was right about that. I did guess the killer early on, but a blame that on the director of the movie allowing the killer to be a little too obvious, because in books, I hardly ever guess right. Just another reason to read. You cant tell the killer is looking all shifty. ;-)

The cast:
Lori Loughlin is very well suited to the role of Jennifer. I really enjoyed the way she played the role. Shes very likable and that makes her fun to watch.  The actor who plays Jennifers husband, Jason Shannon, Rick Ravenello was a good match for Loughlin. They felt like a real couple to me. Actress Sarah Strange played the role of Danielle, Jennifers business partner. This actress made her character very believable. The rest of the cast, did a great job in their roles and made for an excellent ensemble.

Looking back on my review, it almost sounds like I didn't enjoy GARAGE SALE MYSTERY. Thats not true at all. I had a lot of fun watching it. And my purchase of the DVD was well worth the price (which was very reasonable) because I will watch this one over and over.

Cozy mystery fans will enjoy GARAGE SALE MYSTERY. Its good, clean mystery that everyone in the family can enjoy.  If you don't get the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel, consider purchasing the DVDs available, or speak to your library about getting them.",1484784000,6,4297,4.518661518661519

6200976,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"If youve read my book reviews, youll know that I enjoy reading cozy mysteries, so it would make sense that I would enjoy watching them as well. I came across this Hallmark movie, in the previews for a different movie I was watching, and figured I would give it a watch. And I really enjoyed it.

All the actors did a great job, but my favorite character would have to be Sarah Strange, who plays Dani, the main characters business partner. I loved her outfits, and she had just a bit of quirkiness to her that was adorable. You may also recognize the main character, Lori Loughlin aka Jennifer, who use to be on Full House. She must know where the fountain of youth is because she barely looks like shes aged.

The mystery itself was very well written, and had me guessing until towards the end, which is always enjoyable. And I really liked the cinematography, how they would focus on an item and add a bit of filter to it, to give it an old-fashioned feeling. I also really enjoyed this when I watched The Good Witch TV series (also by Hallmark), so maybe this is their trademark camera work. Not really sure though since Ive not watched many Hallmark movies before.

This movie series, which there are currently six of, with a seventh in production, came from the two book series by Suzi Weinert. She wrote her first novel when she was 72, which just goes to show, its never too late to do something you want to do.

6200995,3,B00HRUQ8HK,"Of the Hallmark Mystery and Movie Channel franchises, the one that seems to be doing the best features a woman who loves garage sales.  I find that ironic since it is based on a series of books I haven't heard of.  In fact, best I can tell, there are now more movies than books in the series.  But since I am a fan of star Lori Loughlin thanks to her days on Full House, I sat down to watch the first, Garage Sale Mystery.  I found it entertaining but lacking.

Jennifer Shannon (Lori Loughlin) loves garage sales, heading out every Saturday hunting for any bargain she can find.  Most of those bargains she then sells at her second hand shop.  Since she is out every week, she often sees the same people over and over again.

Which is why she becomes curious when she hears of a string of robberies in the area she usually shops.  Some of the houses that have sales are being hit the next week.  When she finds an old friend dead a couple of days after another sale, Jennifer really becomes concerned.  Is another regular a killer?

My main issue is that the mystery is fairly light.  Yes, there are a couple of cool connections that are made, but I had the main plot pretty much figured out before the half-way point.  That never happens since I tend to over think things, so I found that disappointing.

Add to that the usual Hallmark original movie syndrome.  There are a couple of jumps that the movie made I had to struggle to follow, and a romance between the detective in charge and Jennifers daughter, while certainly cute, felt a bit rushed.

Having said that, I did enjoy watching this movie.  It was nice to see a mystery with a main character who is happily married and who is old enough to have a daughter in college and a teenage son.  Most of the time, the main characters in the books I read are late 20s or early 30s and single.  While the romance with the daughter felt forced, the scenes between her and the detective were very cute and made me laugh.  And I absolutely love how Jennifer and her husband interacted and the obvious love between them.

I don't know what it is about Hallmark productions, but they exude a certain atmosphere both in the production and the acting.  That certainly creeps into the acting here as well; its not that the acting is bad, but it isn't the best it could be either.

While Garage Sale Mystery wasn't an outstanding beginning, I certainly did enjoy it and the characters enough to be willing to revisit them.  Since I have the rest of the films on my DVR, Im sure I will be doing that soon.",1460937600,,2548,4.3588110403397025
6200996,5,B00HRUQ8HK,"My fiance makes me watch these. I try to get out of it every time but about mid way through the show I am hooked. It really is an interesting mystery show with some good comedy moments.

P.S. - I don't tell my friends I watch Hallmark movies. :)",1460592000,,245,4.0
6200997,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"Hallmark's ""Garage Sale Mystery"" is a pleasant little movie with attractive characters and a twisty plot; something lighter than the hard-boiled fare available on most television channels these days but not so light that it's pure confection.
Lori Loughlin plays the owner of a second-hand antique store who finds a lot of her stock at garage and yard sales. She's also a fan of police dramas on television so when she notices that a recent spate of burglaries happens to coincide with the fact the victims all had yard sales she puts two and two together and comes up with four: Were the burglars using the sales as an opportunity to do some quiet recon of the homes? She takes her concern to the police who do not take her seriously... at first. When she later discovers the body of a friend who has apparently died after falling down some stairs she has trouble believing the woman's death was an accident.
There are some interesting subplots in the narrative: Her business partner's bad luck on the dating scene, her daughter's break-up with her longtime boyfriend, a leaky roof, some fake jewelry, a missing Buddha statue, and an incredibly valuable vase give viewers something to think about while Loughlin's character tries to solve what she thinks might be the murder of her friend.
The verdict: A pleasant film, something to relax with on one of those nights when you just feel like watching something that doesn't overtax the brain.",1460246400,4,1442,4.818548387096774

6201085,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"Routine fodder from Hallmark, there really wasn't much of a mystery as the culprit(s) are obvious at the outset; the only thing missing was the why, delivered at the very end.  Otherwise it was pleasant enough, featuring characters highly manufactured for cuteness sake, no one felt real.  It was like watching Nancy Drew as an adult as played by Lori Loughlin (Jennifer Shannon, a professional garage sale shopper).  Loughlin played the character very-very-very enthusiastically.  A little miss know-it-all who just had to convince the police that a crime had been committed.

This production suffers from familiarity and a bizarre attempt at `style' by an over zealous camera man given to using gimmicks (the camera zooms in and out in a herky-jerky fashion, leaving half the scene blurry while focusing on a few items.  Scenes are abruptly cut.  It was like being confined in a music video without the music!).",1423008000,2,913,5.087248322147651

6201138,4,B00HRUQ8HK,"If Hallmark had a mind to, Garage Sale Mystery as its newest offbeat detection series would go hand in hand with the postal sleuthing that goes on in Signed, Sealed, Delivered. So maybe that'll happen. Based on Suzi Weinert's novel Garage Sale Stalker, Garage Sale Mystery is a 2013 Hallmark mystery that presents a novel concept for a whodunit flick. Lori Loughlin, my old crush, anchors the narrative with a lively performance. She plays Jennifer Shannon, devoted mom and wife who happens to be a savvy bargain hunter. She combs the neighborhood for garage sales, ever with an eye for items she could purchase on the cheap but sell for a neat price in her second-hand shop, Rags to Riches. But when the neighborhood is plagued by a rash of home burglaries and then a dear friend is murdered, Jennifer applies her keen observational skills to get in the wa- uh, to help the police solve the two baffling mysteries.

Now a wee plot SPOILER alert...

Never mind that the movie doesn't even try for subterfuge. Y'know, at the start of any mystery, whenever a pensive character seeks to schedule an important appointment, odds are that that character'll go down with a case of suspicious death. So it goes that Jennifer's pal, Kate, arranges a lunch date with Jennifer only to fail to show up. She's found later on, supposed fatal victim of a falling accident. But was it really an accident, considering that her time of death was placed simultaneously with when her house was burgled?

Jennifer has a theory. She believes that the perpetrator(s) had been attending garage sales so as to case houses. Cop detective Adam Iverson (Andrew Dunbar) doesn't buy it, but he indulges her anyway. Maybe because there aren't any other leads. Dunbar and Loughlin make for an oddball but pretty interesting sleuthing team. For all you 'shippers, note that there's no romance that blooms. Their informal partnership is strictly in the interest of nabbing the crooks.

The central puzzle itself isn't too hard to work out; there are only so many suspects, after all. But, listen, it's a neat new way to look at a mystery. It adeptly juggles its lighthearted beats with its moments of gravity. And it targets that often neglected branch of mystery fandom: the garage sale enthusiasts. My coupon-snipping mom adores this movie, and so does my weird neighbor who's always in a ratty bathrobe. And if that's not enough of an endorsement for you to see the film, well, there's no hope for you. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1406332800,4,2491,4.786046511627907

Also, it was strange to see so many yard sales at BIG houses--real mansions--which seemed like odd settings.  Basically the mystery is just kind of mundane:  a woman is found dead; was it an accident or was she murdered?  That's it.  The only real up side to the movie was that the main character's family were down-to-earth individuals.  It's a relief to see a husband and wife who actually like each other and get along with their children!",1404691200,15,518,4.4

One of the better HMM series in my opinion though follows a pretty predictable format which of course is what Hallmark does.",1522800000,,386,4.608695652173913
